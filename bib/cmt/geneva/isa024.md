### [Isaiah Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001)

[Isaiah 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 24:1</span></span>

Behold, the LORD maketh the (a) earth empty, and maketh it waste, and
turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad its inhabitants.

\(a\) This prophecy is as a conclusion of that which has been threatened
to the Jews and other nations from the 13th chapter and therefore by the
earth he means those lands which were named before.

[Isaiah 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 24:2</span></span>

And it shall be, as with the people, so with the (b) priest; as with the
servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as
with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the
borrower; as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest
to him.

\(b\) Because this was a name of dignity it was also applied to them who
were not of Aaron's family, and so signifies also a man of dignity, as
in ([Sa2 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018); [Sa2
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#025); [Ch1
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#017)) and by these words the prophet
signifies a horrible confusion, where there will be neither religion,
order nor policy, ([Hos 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#009)).

[Isaiah 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 24:5</span></span>

The earth (c) also is defiled under its inhabitants; because they have
transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting
covenant.

\(c\) That is, does not give her fruit for the sin of the people, whom
the earth deceived of their nourishment because they deceived God of his
honour.

[Isaiah 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 24:6</span></span>

Therefore hath the (d) curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell in
it are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are (e) burned,
and few men left.

\(d\) Written in the law, as in ([Lev
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#014); [Deu
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#016)) thus the prophets used to apply
particularly the menaces and promises which are general in the law.

\(e\) With heat and drought, or else that they were consumed with the
fire of God's wrath.

[Isaiah 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 24:10</span></span>

The city of (f) confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that
no man may enter.

\(f\) Which as it was without order so now should it be brought to
desolation and confusion: and this was not only meant of Jerusalem, but
of all the other wicked cities.

[Isaiah 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 24:11</span></span>

\[There is\] a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the
(g) mirth of the land is gone.

\(g\) Because they did not use God's benefits correctly their pleasures
would fail, and they would fall to mourning.

[Isaiah 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 24:13</span></span>

When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, \[there
shall be\] (h) as the shaking of an olive tree, \[and\] as the gleaning
grapes when the vintage is done.

\(h\) He comforts the faithful, declaring that in this great desolation
the Lord will assemble his Church which will praise his Name, as in
([Isa 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022)).

[Isaiah 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 24:14</span></span>

They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the
LORD, they shall cry aloud from (i) the sea.

\(i\) From the utmost coasts of the world, where the gospel will be
preached as in ([Isa 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#016)).

[Isaiah 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 24:16</span></span>

From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, \[even\] glory
to the (k) righteous. But I said, (l) My leanness, my leanness, woe to
me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the
treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.

\(k\) Meaning to God, who will publish his gospel through all the world.

\(l\) I am consumed with care, considering the affliction of the Church,
both by foreign enemies and domestic. Some read, My secret, my secret:
that is, it was revealed to the prophet, that the good would be
preserved and the wicked destroyed.

[Isaiah 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 24:18</span></span>

And it shall come to pass, \[that\] he who fleeth from the noise of the
fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of
the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the (m) windows from on high
are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.

\(m\) Meaning that God's wrath and vengeance would be over and under
them, so that they would not escape no more than they did at Noah's
flood.

[Isaiah 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 24:21</span></span>

And it shall come to pass in that day, \[that\] the LORD shall (n)
punish the host of the high ones \[that are\] on high, and the kings of
the earth upon the earth.

\(n\) There is no power so high or mighty, but God will visit him with
his rods.

[Isaiah 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 24:22</span></span>

And they shall be gathered together, \[as\] prisoners are gathered in
the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall
they be (o) visited.

\(o\) Not with his rods as in ([Isa
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#021)) but will be comforted.

[Isaiah 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 24:23</span></span>

\(p\) Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the
LORD of hosts shall reign on mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before
his ancients gloriously.

\(p\) When God restores his Church, the glory of it will so shine, and
his ministers (who are called his ancient men) that the sun and the moon
will be dark in comparison to it.
