### [Psalms Chapter 79](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 79:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 79:1</span></span>

"A Psalm of Asaph." O God, (a) the heathen are come into thine
inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem
on heaps.

\(a\) The people cry to God against the barbarous tyranny of the
Babylonians who spoiled God's inheritance, polluted his temple,
destroyed his religion, and murdered his people.

[Psalms 79:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 79:2</span></span>

The (b) dead bodies of thy servants have they given \[to be\] meat unto
the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the
earth.

\(b\) The prophets show to what extremities God sometimes allows his
Church to fall to exercise their faith, before he sets his hand to
deliver them.

[Psalms 79:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 79:3</span></span>

Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and \[there
was\] none to (c) bury \[them\].

\(c\) Their friends and relatives did not dare to bury them for fear of
the enemies.

[Psalms 79:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 79:4</span></span>

We are become a reproach to our (d) neighbours, a scorn and derision to
them that are round about us.

\(d\) Of which some came from Abraham but were degenerate: and others
were open enemies to your religion, but they both laughed at our
miseries.

[Psalms 79:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 79:5</span></span>

How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy (e) burn
like fire?

\(e\) Will you completely consume us for our sins, before you take us to
mercy?

[Psalms 79:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 79:8</span></span>

O remember not against us (f) former iniquities: let thy tender mercies
speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.

\(f\) Which we and our fathers have committed.

[Psalms 79:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 79:9</span></span>

Help us, O God of our (h) salvation, for the glory of thy name: and
deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.

\(h\) Seeing we have no other Saviour, neither can we help ourselves,
and also by our salvation your Name will be praised: therefore O Lord,
help us.

[Psalms 79:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 79:11</span></span>

Let the sighing of the (i) prisoner come before thee; according to the
greatness of thy power preserve thou (k) those that are appointed to
die;

\(i\) Who though in respect to God they were justly punished for their
sins, yet in consideration of their cause were unjustly murdered.

\(k\) Who were captives among their enemies and could look for nothing
but death.

[Psalms 79:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 79:13</span></span>

So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for
ever: (l) we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.

\(l\) We ought to desire no benefit from God, but on this condition to
praise his name, ([Isa 43:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#021).md).
