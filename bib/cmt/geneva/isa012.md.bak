### [Isaiah Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 12:1</span></span>

And in that day thou (a) shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee: though
thou wast angry with me, thy anger is turned away, and thou didst
comfort me.

\(a\) He shows how the Church will praise God, when they are delivered
from their captivity.

[Isaiah 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 12:2</span></span>

Behold, God \[is\] my (b) salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid:
for the LORD \[is\] my strength and \[my\] song; he also is become my
salvation.

\(b\) Our salvation stands only in God, who gives us an assured
confidence, constancy and opportunity to praise him for the same.

[Isaiah 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 12:3</span></span>

Therefore with joy shall ye (c) draw water out of the wells of
salvation.

\(c\) The graces of God will be so abundant that you may receive them in
as great plenty as waters out of a fountain that is full.

[Isaiah 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 12:6</span></span>

Cry aloud and shout, (d) thou inhabitant of Zion: for great \[is\] the
Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.

\(d\) You who are of the Church.
