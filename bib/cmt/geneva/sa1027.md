### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 27:1</span></span>

And David said in his heart, I shall now (a) perish one day by the hand
of Saul: \[there is\] nothing better for me than that I should speedily
escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me,
to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his
hand.

\(a\) David distrusts God's protection and therefore flees to the
idolaters, who were enemies to God's people.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 27:3</span></span>

And David (b) dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with
his household, \[even\] David with his two wives, Ahinoam the
Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.

\(b\) Thus God by his providence changes the enemies hearts, and makes
them favour his in their need.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 27:5</span></span>

And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, (c)
let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell
there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?

\(c\) Let your officers appoint me a place.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 27:8</span></span>

And David and his men went up, and invaded the (d) Geshurites, and the
Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those \[nations were\] of old the
inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of
Egypt.

\(d\) These were the wicked Canaanites, whom God had appointed to be
destroyed.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 27:10</span></span>

And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said,
Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the (e)
Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.

\(e\) A family of the tribe of Judah, ([Ch1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#009).md).
