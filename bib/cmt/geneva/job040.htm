<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">job 40:8</A></FONT></span></p>Wilt thou also disannul (a) my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? 
<p>
<p>(a) Signifying that they who justify themselves condemn God as unjust.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#010">Job 40:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">job 40:10</A></FONT></span></p>Deck thyself now [with] (b) majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.

<p>
<p>(e) This beast is thought to be the elephant, or some other, which is unknown. 
<p>
<p>(f) Whom I made as well as you. 
<p>
<p>(g) This commends the providence of God toward man: for if he were given to devour as a lion, nothing would be able to resist him, or content him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#019">Job 40:19</A></p>

<p>
<p>(h) He is one of the chief works of God among the beasts. 
<p>
<p>(i) Though man dare not come near him, yet God can kill him.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">job 40:23</A></FONT></span></p>Behold, he drinketh up a river, (k) [and] hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.
