### [Ezra Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001.md)

[Ezra 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ezr 5:2</span></span>

Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of
Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which \[is\] at Jerusalem:
and with them \[were\] the prophets of God (a) helping them.

\(a\) Who encouraged them to go forward, and cursed them because they
were more careful to build their own houses, than zealous to build the
temple of God.

[Ezra 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ezr 5:4</span></span>

\(b\) Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of
the men that make this building?

\(b\) That is, the enemies asked this, as in ([Ezr
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#010).md).

[Ezra 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ezr 5:5</span></span>

But the (c) eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they
could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then
they returned answer by letter concerning this \[matter\].

\(c\) His favour and the spirit of strength.

[Ezra 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ezr 5:11</span></span>

And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God
of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many
years ago, which a (d) great king of Israel builded and set up.

\(d\) That is, Solomon.

[Ezra 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ezr 5:13</span></span>

But in the (e) first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon \[the same\] king
Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.

\(e\) Read ([Ezr 1:1,2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001).md).

[Ezra 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ezr 5:14</span></span>

And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which
Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that \[was\] in Jerusalem, and
brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take
out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto \[one\],
whose name \[was\] (f) Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;

\(f\) Read ([Ezr 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#008).md).

[Ezra 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ezr 5:17</span></span>

Now therefore, if \[it seem\] good to the king, let there be search made
in the king's (g) treasure house, which \[is\] there at Babylon, whether
it be \[so\], that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this
house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us
concerning this matter.

\(g\) Meaning in the library or places where lay the register or record
of times.
