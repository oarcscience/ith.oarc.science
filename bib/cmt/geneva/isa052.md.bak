### [Isaiah Chapter 52](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 52:1</span></span>

Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful
garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no (a)
more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.

\(a\) No wicked tyrant, who will subvert God's true religion and oppress
the conscience.

[Isaiah 52:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 52:2</span></span>

Shake thyself from the (b) dust; arise, \[and\] sit down, O Jerusalem:
loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.

\(b\) Put off the garments of sorrow and heaviness and put on the
apparel of joy and gladness.

[Isaiah 52:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 52:3</span></span>

For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for (c) nothing; and ye
shall be redeemed without money.

\(c\) The Babylonians paid nothing to me for you: therefore I will take
you again without ransom.

[Isaiah 52:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 52:4</span></span>

For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went (d) down in times past into
Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian (e) oppressed them without
cause.

\(d\) When Jacob went there in times of famine.

\(e\) The Egyptians might pretend some reason to oppress my people
because they went there and remained among them, but the Assyrians have
no title to excuse their tyranny by, and therefore I will punish them
more than I did the Egyptians.

[Isaiah 52:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 52:5</span></span>

Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken
away for nothing? they that rule over them make them to wail, saith the
LORD; and my name continually every day \[is\] (f) blasphemed.

\(f\) That is, by the wicked, who think that I have no power to deliver
them.

[Isaiah 52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 52:7</span></span>

How (g) beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth
good tidings, that proclaimeth peace; that bringeth good tidings of
good, that proclaimeth salvation; that saith to Zion, Thy God reigneth!

\(g\) Signifying that the joy and good tidings of their deliverance
would make their affliction in the mean time more easy: but this is
chiefly meant of the spiritual joy, as in ([Nah
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015.md); [Rom
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#015).md).

[Isaiah 52:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 52:8</span></span>

\(h\) Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together
shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall
bring again Zion.

\(h\) The prophets who are your watchmen will publish your deliverance:
this was begun under Zerubbabel, Ezra and Nehemiah, but was accomplished
under Christ.

[Isaiah 52:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 52:10</span></span>

The LORD hath made (i) bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations;
and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.

\(i\) As ready to smite his enemies and to deliver his people.

[Isaiah 52:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 52:11</span></span>

\(k\) Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from there, touch no unclean
\[thing\]; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that (l) bear the
vessels of the LORD.

\(k\) He warns the faithful not to pollute themselves with the
superstitions of the Babylonians, as ([Isa
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#020.md); [Co2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#017).md).

\(l\) For the time is at hand that the priests and Levites chiefly (and
so by them all the people, who will be as the Levites in this office)
will carry home vessels of the temple which Nebuchadnezzar had taken
away.

[Isaiah 52:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 52:12</span></span>

For ye shall not go out (m) with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD
will go before you; and the God of Israel \[will be\] your rear guard.

\(m\) As your fathers did out of Egypt.

[Isaiah 52:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 52:13</span></span>

Behold, my (n) servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and
extolled, and be very high.

\(n\) Meaning Christ, by whom our spiritual deliverance would be wrought
of which this was a sign.

[Isaiah 52:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 52:14</span></span>

As many were astonished at thee; his visage was so (o) marred more than
any man, and his form more than the sons of men:

\(o\) In the corrupt judgment of man, Christ in his person was not
valued.

[Isaiah 52:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 52:15</span></span>

So (p) shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their (q)
mouths at him: for \[that\] which had not been told them shall they see;
and \[that\] which they had not heard shall they (r) consider.

\(p\) He will spread his word through many nations.

\(q\) In sign of reverence, and as being astonished at his excellency.

\(r\) By the preaching of the gospel.
