### [Amos Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001.md)

[Amos 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 4:1</span></span>

Hear this word, ye (a) kine of Bashan, that \[are\] in the mountain of
Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to
their masters, (b) Bring, and let us drink.

\(a\) Thus he calls the princes and governors, who being overwhelmed
with the great abundance of God's benefits, forgot God, and therefore he
calls them by the name of beasts and not of men.

\(b\) They encourage those who have authority over the people to oppress
them, so that they may have profit by it.

[Amos 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 4:2</span></span>

The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come
upon you, that he will take you away with (c) hooks, and your posterity
with fishhooks.

\(c\) He alludes to fishers, who catch fish by hooks or thorns.

[Amos 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 4:4</span></span>

Come to (d) Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression;
and bring your sacrifices every morning, \[and\] your tithes after three
(e) years:

\(d\) He speaks this in contempt of those who resorted to those places,
thinking that their great devotion and good intention was sufficient to
have bound God to them.

\(e\) Read ([Deu 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#028).md).

[Amos 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 4:5</span></span>

And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving (f) with leaven, and proclaim
\[and\] publish the free offerings: for this (g) liketh you, O ye
children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.

\(f\) As ([Lev 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#013).md).

\(g\) You only delight in these outward ceremonies and care for nothing
else.

[Amos 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 4:6</span></span>

And I also have given you (h) cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and
want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me,
saith the LORD.

\(h\) That is, lack of bread and meat.

[Amos 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 4:7</span></span>

And also I have withholden the rain from you, when \[there were\] yet
three (i) months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city,
and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon,
and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.

\(i\) I stopped the rain until the fruits of the earth were destroyed
with drought, and yet you would not consider to return to me by
repentance.

[Amos 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 4:8</span></span>

So two \[or\] three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but
they were (k) not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the
LORD.

\(k\) They could not find enough water where they had heard that it had
rained.

[Amos 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 4:10</span></span>

I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of (l) Egypt: your
young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses;
and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils:
yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.

\(l\) As I plagued the Egyptians; ([Exo
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#010).md).

[Amos 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 4:11</span></span>

I have overthrown \[some\] of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah,
and ye were as a (m) firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye
not returned unto me, saith the LORD.

\(m\) You were almost all consumed, and a few of you were wonderfully
preserved; ([Kg2 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#026).md).

[Amos 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 4:12</span></span>

Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: \[and\] because I will do
this unto thee, prepare to (n) meet thy God, O Israel.

\(n\) Turn to him by repentance.
