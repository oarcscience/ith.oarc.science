<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">sa2 5:1</A></FONT></span></p>Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we [are] thy (a) bone and thy flesh. 
<p>
<p>(a) We are of your kindred and closely related to you. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#003">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">sa2 5:3</A></FONT></span></p>So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron (b) before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel. 
<p>
<p>(b) That is, taking the Lord to witness: for the ark was still in Abinadab's house. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">sa2 5:6</A></FONT></span></p>And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the (c) blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither. 
<p>
<p>(c) The children of God called idols blind and lame guides: therefore the Jebusites meant that they should prove that their gods were neither blind nor lame. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#008">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">sa2 5:8</A></FONT></span></p>And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, [that are] hated of David's soul, [he shall be chief and captain]. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not (d) come into the house. 
<p>
<p>(d) The idols should no longer enter into that place. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#009">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">sa2 5:9</A></FONT></span></p>So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from (e) Millo and inward. 
<p>
<p>(e) He built from the town house round about to his own house (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#008">Ch1 11:8</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#019">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">sa2 5:19</A></FONT></span></p>And David (f) enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand. 
<p>
<p>(f) By Abiathar the priest. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#022">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">sa2 5:22</A></FONT></span></p>And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of (g) Rephaim. 
<p>
<p>(g) Meaning the valley of giants, which David called Baalperazim, because of his victory. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#025">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">sa2 5:25</A></FONT></span></p>And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to (h) Gazer. 
<p>
<p>(h) Which was in the tribe of Benjamin, but the Philistines possessed it.
