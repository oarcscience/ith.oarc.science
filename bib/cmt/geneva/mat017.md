### [Matthew Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001)

[Matthew 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 17:1</span></span>

And (1) (a) after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his
brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,

\(1\) Christ in his present company is humble in the gospel, but all the
while he is Lord both of heaven and earth.

\(a\) Luke counts eight days, containing in that number the first and
last, and Matthew speaks but of the days between them.

[Matthew 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 17:2</span></span>

And was (b) transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun,
and his raiment was white as the light.

\(b\) Changed into another colour.

[Matthew 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 17:5</span></span>

While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold
a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is (c) my beloved Son, in
whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.

\(c\) The word "my" distinguishes Christ from other children. For he is
God's natural son, we by adoption; therefore he is called the first
begotten among the brethren, because although he is by right the only
son, yet he is chief among many, in that he is the source and head of
the adoption.

[Matthew 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 17:6</span></span>

And when the disciples heard \[it\], they (d) fell on their face, and
were sore afraid.

\(d\) Fell down flat on their faces and worshipped him, as in ([Mat
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#011)).

[Matthew 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 17:9</span></span>

And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying,
Tell the (e) vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from
the dead.

\(e\) Which they saw, otherwise the word used in this place is usually
used in referring to that which is seen in a dream.

[Matthew 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 17:14</span></span>

\(2\) And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a
\[certain\] man, (f) kneeling down to him, and saying,

\(2\) Men are unworthy of Christ's goodness, yet nonetheless he pays
attention to them.

\(f\) As men used to do when making supplication.

[Matthew 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 17:15</span></span>

Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is (g) lunatick, and sore vexed: for
ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.

\(g\) They that at certain times of the moon are troubled with the
falling sickness, or any other kind of disease: but in this case, we
must so understand it, that besides the natural disease he had a demonic
derangement.

[Matthew 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 17:19</span></span>

\(3\) Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we
cast him out?

\(3\) Incredulity and distrust hinder and break the direction of God's
benefits.

[Matthew 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 17:21</span></span>

\(4\) Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by (h) prayer and fasting.

\(4\) The remedy against distrust.

\(h\) To help us to understand the watchfulness and diligence of earnest
prayer, which cannot be without sobriety.

[Matthew 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 17:22</span></span>

\(5\) And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of
man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:

\(5\) Our minds must be prepared more and more for the offence of the
cross.

[Matthew 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 17:24</span></span>

\(6\) And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute
\[money\] came to Peter, and said, Doth (i) not your master (k) pay (l)
tribute?

\(6\) In that Christ willingly obeys Caesar's edicts, he shows that
civil policy is not taken away by the Gospel.

\(i\) He does not deny, but he asks.

\(k\) Should he not pay?

\(l\) They that were from twenty years of age to fifty, paid half a
shekel to the Sanctuary, ([Exo 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013)).
This was an Attic didrachma which the Roman exacted after they had
subdued Judea.

[Matthew 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 17:25</span></span>

He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him,
saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth
take custom or tribute? of their own (m) children, or of strangers?

\(m\) By children we must not understand subjects who pay tribute, but
natural children.

[Matthew 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 17:27</span></span>

Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and
cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou
hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a (n) piece of money: that take,
and give unto them for me and thee.

\(n\) The word used here is "stater", which is in value four didrachmas;
every drachma is about five pence.
