### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 10:1</span></span>

And Ahab had seventy (a) sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and
sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them
that brought up Ahab's \[children\], saying,

\(a\) The Scripture calls them sons who are either children or nephews.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 10:3</span></span>

Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and (b) set
\[him\] on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.

\(b\) He wrote this, to prove them whether they would take his side or
not.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 10:6</span></span>

Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye \[be\]
mine, and \[if\] ye will hearken unto my voice, (c) take ye the heads of
the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this
time. Now the king's sons, \[being\] seventy persons, \[were\] with the
great men of the city, which brought them up.

\(c\) God as a just judge punishes the wicked children of wicked parents
to the third and fourth generations.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 10:9</span></span>

And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and
said to all the people, Ye \[be\] (d) righteous: behold, I conspired
against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?

\(d\) You cannot justly condemn me for the king's death, seeing as you
have done the same to his posterity: for the Lord commanded me, and
moved you to carry out his judgment.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 10:11</span></span>

So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all
his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his (e) priests, until he left him
none remaining.

\(e\) Meaning, the idolatrous priests.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 10:14</span></span>

And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at
the pit of the shearing house, \[even\] two and forty men; (f) neither
left he any of them.

\(f\) Thus God's vengeance is on them who have any part or familiarity
with the wicked.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 10:15</span></span>

And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of
Rechab \[coming\] to meet him: and he (g) saluted him, and said to him,
Is thine heart right, as my heart \[is\] with thy heart? And Jehonadab
answered, It is. If it be, give \[me\] thine hand. And he gave \[him\]
his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.

\(g\) For he feared God, and lamented the wickedness of those times:
therefore Jehu was glad to join with him: of Rechab read ([Jer
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#002).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 10:18</span></span>

And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab
served (h) Baal a little; \[but\] Jehu shall serve him much.

\(h\) Here Baal is taken for Ashtaroth the idol of the Zidonians, who
Jezebel caused to be worshipped, as it is also so used in ([Kg1
22:53](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#053).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 10:23</span></span>

And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal,
and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be
here with you none of the (i) servants of the LORD, but the worshippers
of Baal only.

\(i\) Thus God would have his servants preserved and idolaters
destroyed, as in his law he gives express command, ([Deu
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#005).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 10:25</span></span>

And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt
offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in,
\[and\] slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the
edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast \[them\] out, and
went to the (k) city of the house of Baal.

\(k\) Which was near Samaria.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg2 10:30</span></span>

And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing
\[that which is\] right in mine eyes, \[and\] hast done unto the house
of Ahab according to all that \[was\] in mine heart, thy (l) children of
the fourth \[generation\] shall sit on the throne of Israel.

\(l\) Thus God approves and rewards his zeal, in executing God's
judgment, though his wickedness was later punished.
