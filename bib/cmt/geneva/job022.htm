<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#002">Job 22:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">job 22:2</A></FONT></span></p>Can a man be (a) profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself? 
<p>
<p>(a) Though man was just, yet God could not profit from this his justice; and therefore when he punished him, he had no regard to his justice, but to his sin.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#004">Job 22:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">job 22:4</A></FONT></span></p>Will he reprove thee for fear (b) of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment? 
<p>
<p>(b) Lest you should reprove or hurt him?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#006">Job 22:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">job 22:6</A></FONT></span></p>For thou hast taken a (c) pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing. 
<p>
<p>(c) You have been cruel and without charity, and would do nothing for the poor, but for your own advantage.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#008">Job 22:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">job 22:8</A></FONT></span></p>But [as for] the mighty man, he (d) had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it. 
<p>
<p>(d) When you were in power and authority you did not do justice but wrong.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#009">Job 22:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">job 22:9</A></FONT></span></p>Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the (e) fatherless have been broken. 
<p>
<p>(e) You have not only not shown pity, but oppressed them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#011">Job 22:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">job 22:11</A></FONT></span></p>Or darkness, [that] thou canst not see; and (f) abundance of waters cover thee. 
<p>
<p>(f) That is, manifold afflictions.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#012">Job 22:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">job 22:12</A></FONT></span></p>[Is] not God in the (g) height of heaven? and behold the height of the (h) stars, how high they are! 
<p>
<p>(g) He accuses Job of impiety and contempt of God, as thought he would say, If you pass not for men, yet consider the height of God's majesty. 
<p>
<p>(h) That so much the more by that excellent work you may fear God, and reverence him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#013">Job 22:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">job 22:13</A></FONT></span></p>And thou sayest, How doth God (i) know? can he judge through the dark cloud? 
<p>
<p>(i) He reproves Job, as though he denied God's providence and that he could not see the things that were done in this world.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#015">Job 22:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">job 22:15</A></FONT></span></p>Hast thou marked the old way (k) which wicked men have trodden? 
<p>
<p>(k) How God has punished them from the beginning?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#016">Job 22:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">job 22:16</A></FONT></span></p>Which were (l) cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood: 
<p>
<p>(l) He proves God's providence by the punishment of the wicked, whom he takes away before they can bring their wicked purposes to pass.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#018">Job 22:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">job 22:18</A></FONT></span></p>Yet he (m) filled their houses with good [things]: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 
<p>
<p>(m) He answers to that which Job had said, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#007">Job 21:7</A>) that the wicked have prosperity in this world; desiring that he might not be a partaker of the like.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#019">Job 22:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">job 22:19</A></FONT></span></p>The righteous see [it], and are glad: (n) and the innocent laugh them to scorn. 
<p>
<p>(n) The just rejoice at the destruction of the wicked for two reasons, first because God shows himself judge of the world and by this means continues his honour and glory: secondly because God shows that he had care over his in that he punished their enemies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#020">Job 22:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">job 22:20</A></FONT></span></p>Whereas (o) our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of (p) them the fire consumeth. 
<p>
<p>(o) That is, the state and preservation of the godly, is hid under God's wings. 
<p>
<p>(p) Meaning of the wicked.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#021">Job 22:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">job 22:21</A></FONT></span></p>Acquaint now thyself (q) with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee. 
<p>
<p>(q) He exhorts Job to repentance, and to return to God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#023">Job 22:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">job 22:23</A></FONT></span></p>If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt (r) be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles. 
<p>
<p>(r) God will restore to you all your substance.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#024">Job 22:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">job 22:24</A></FONT></span></p>Then shalt thou lay up gold as (s) dust, and the [gold] of Ophir as the stones of the brooks. 
<p>
<p>(s) Which will be in abundance like dust.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#028">Job 22:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">job 22:28</A></FONT></span></p>Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the (t) light shall shine upon thy ways. 
<p>
<p>(t) That is, the favour of God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#029">Job 22:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">job 22:29</A></FONT></span></p>(u) When [men] are cast down, then thou shalt say, [There is] lifting up; and he shall save the humble person. 
<p>
<p>(u) God will deliver his when the wicked are destroyed round about them, as in the flood and in Sodom.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#030">Job 22:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">job 22:30</A></FONT></span></p>He shall deliver the (x) island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands. 
<p>
<p>(x) God will deliver a whole country from peril, even for the just man's sake.
