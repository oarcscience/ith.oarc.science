<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#001">Psalms 64:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 64:1</A></FONT></span></p>"To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David." Hear my (a) voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy. 
<p>
<p>(a) In that he calls to God with his voice, it is a sign that his prayer was vehement, and that his life was in danger.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#002">Psalms 64:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 64:2</A></FONT></span></p>Hide me from the (b) secret counsel of the wicked; from the (c) insurrection of the workers of iniquity: 
<p>
<p>(b) That is, from their secret malice. 
<p>
<p>(c) That is, their outward violence.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#003">Psalms 64:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 64:3</A></FONT></span></p>Who whet their tongue like a sword, [and] bend [their bows to shoot] their arrows, [even] (d) bitter words: 
<p>
<p>(d) False reports and slanders.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#004">Psalms 64:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 64:4</A></FONT></span></p>That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and (e) fear not. 
<p>
<p>(e) To be without fear of God and reverence of man, is a sign of reprobation.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#005">Psalms 64:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 64:5</A></FONT></span></p>They (f) encourage themselves [in] an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them? 
<p>
<p>(f) The more the wicked set God's children in misery, the more bold and impudent are they in oppressing them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#006">Psalms 64:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 64:6</A></FONT></span></p>They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward [thought] of every one (g) [of them], and the heart, [is] deep. 
<p>
<p>(g) There is no way so secret and subtle to do hurt, which they did not invent for his destruction.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#008">Psalms 64:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 64:8</A></FONT></span></p>So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall (h) flee away. 
<p>
<p>(h) To see God's heavy judgments against them, and how he has caught them in their own snares.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#010">Psalms 64:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 64:10</A></FONT></span></p>The righteous (i) shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory. 
<p>
<p>(i) When they will consider that he will be favourable to them as he was to his servant David.
