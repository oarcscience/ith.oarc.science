### [Job Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#001.md)

[Job 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 3:1</span></span>

After this opened (a) Job his mouth, and (b) cursed his day.

\(a\) The seven days ended, ([Job
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#013).md).

\(b\) Here Job begins to feel his great imperfection in this battle
between the spirit and the flesh, ([Rom
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#018).md) and after a manner yields yet in
the end he gets victory though he was in the mean time greatly wounded.

[Job 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 3:3</span></span>

Let the day (c) perish wherein I was born, and the night \[in which\] it
was said, There is a man child conceived.

\(c\) Men should not be weary of their life and curse it, because of the
infinities that it is subject to, but because they are given to sin and
rebellion against God.

[Job 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 3:4</span></span>

Let that day be darkness; let not God (d) regard it from above, neither
let the light shine upon it.

\(d\) Let it be put out of the number of days, and let it not have the
sight of the sun to separate it from the night.

[Job 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 3:5</span></span>

Let darkness and the (e) shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell
upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.

\(e\) That is, most obscure darkness, which makes them afraid of death
that they are in it.

[Job 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 3:8</span></span>

Let them curse it that curse the day, who are (f) ready to raise up
their mourning.

\(f\) Who curse the day of their birth, let them lay that curse on this
night.

[Job 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 3:9</span></span>

Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light,
but \[have\] none; neither let it (g) see the dawning of the day:

\(g\) Let it be always night, and never see day.

[Job 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 3:11</span></span>

\(h\) Why died I not from the womb? \[why\] did I \[not\] give up the
ghost when I came out of the belly?

\(h\) This, and that which follows declares, that when man gives place
to his passions, he is not able to stay or keep measure, but runs
headlong into all evil unless God calls him back.

[Job 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 3:13</span></span>

For now should I have (i) lain still and been quiet, I should have
slept: then had I been at rest,

\(i\) The vehemency of his afflictions made him utter these words as
though death was the end of all miseries, and as if there were no life
after this, which he speaks not as though it were so, but the
infirmities of his flesh caused him to break out in this error of the
wicked.

[Job 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 3:14</span></span>

With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built (k) desolate places
for themselves;

\(k\) He notes the ambition of them who for their pleasure as it were
change the order of nature, and build in most barren places, because
they would by this make their names immortal.

[Job 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 3:17</span></span>

There the wicked (l) cease \[from\] troubling; and there the weary be at
rest.

\(l\) That is, by death the cruelty of the tyrants has ceased.

[Job 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 3:18</span></span>

\[There\] the (m) prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of
the oppressor.

\(m\) All they who sustain any kind of calamity and misery in this
world: which he speaks after the judgment of the flesh.

[Job 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 3:20</span></span>

Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and (n) life unto the
bitter \[in\] soul;

\(n\) He shows that the benefits of God are not comfortable, unless the
heart is joyful, and the conscience quieted.

[Job 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 3:23</span></span>

\[Why is light given\] to a man whose way is (o) hid, and whom God hath
hedged in?

\(o\) That sees not how to come out of his miseries, because he does not
depend on God's providence.

[Job 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 3:25</span></span>

For the thing which I greatly (p) feared is come upon me, and that which
I was afraid of is come unto me.

\(p\) In my prosperity I looked for a fall, as it now has come to pass.

[Job 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 3:26</span></span>

I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; (q) yet
trouble came.

\(q\) The fear of troubles that would ensue, caused my prosperity to
seem to me as nothing, and yet I am not exempted from trouble.
