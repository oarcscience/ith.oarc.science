### [1 Chronicles Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 18:0</span></span>

David's piety and his prayer we had an account of in the foregoing
chapter; here follows immediately that which one might reasonably
expect, an account of his prosperity; for those that seek first the
kingdom of God and the righteousness thereof, as David did, shall have
other things added to them as far as God sees good for them. Here is, I.
His prosperity abroad. He conquered the Philistines ([Ch1
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001).md), the Moabites ([Ch1
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#002).md), the king of Zobah ([Ch1
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#003.md), [Ch1
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#004).md), the Syrians ([Ch1
18:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#005).md), made the king of Hamath his
tributary ([Ch1 18:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#009).md), and the
Edomites ([Ch1 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#012.md), [Ch1
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#013).md). II. His prosperity at home.
His court and kingdom flourished ([Ch1
18:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#014).md). All this we had an account
of before, 2 Sa. 8.

[1 Chronicles 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 18:1</span></span>

After this, it is said ([Ch1 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001).md),
David did those great exploits. After the sweet communion he had had
with God by the word and prayer, as mentioned in the foregoing chapter,
he went on his work with extraordinary vigour and courage, conquering
and to conquer. Thus Jacob, after his vision, lifted up his feet, [Gen
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#001.md).

We have taken a view of these victories before, and shall now only
observe, 1. Those that have been long enemies to the Israel of God will
be brought down at last. The Philistines had, for several generations,
been vexatious to Israel, but now David subdued them, [Ch1
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001.md). Thus shall all opposing rule,
principality, and power, be, at the end of time, put down by the Son of
David, and the most inveterate enemies shall fall before him. 2. Such is
the uncertainty of this world that frequently men lose their wealth and
power when they think to confirm it. Hadarezer was smitten as he went to
establish his dominion, [Ch1 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#003.md). 3.
A horse is a vain thing for safety, so David said ([Psa
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#017).md), and it seems he believed what
he said, for he houghed the chariot-horses, [Ch1
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#004.md). Being resolved not to trust to
them ([Psa 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007).md), he would not use
them. 4. The enemies of God's church are often made to ruin themselves
by helping one another, [Ch1 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#005.md). The
Syrians of Damascus were smitten when they came to help Hadarezer. When
hand thus joins in hand they shall not only not go unpunished, but
thereby they shall be gathered as the sheaves into the floor, [Mic
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011.md), [Mic
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#012.md). 5. The wealth of the sinner
sometimes proves to have been laid up for the just. The Syrians brought
gifts, [Ch1 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#006.md). Their shields of
gold and their brass were brought to Jerusalem, [Ch1
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#007.md), [Ch1
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#008.md). As the tabernacle was built of
the spoils of the Egyptians, so the temple of the spoils of other
Gentile nations, a happy presage of the interest the Gentiles should
have in the gospel church.

[1 Chronicles 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 18:9</span></span>

Here let us learn, 1. That it is our interest to make those our friends
who have the presence of God with them. The king of Hamath, hearing of
David's great success, sent to congratulate him and to court his favour
with a noble present, [Ch1 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#009.md), [Ch1
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#010.md). It is in vain to contend with
the Son of David. Kiss the Son, therefore, lest he be angry; let the
kings and judges of the earth, and all inferior people too, be thus
wise, thus instructed. The presents we are to bring him are not vessels
of gold and silver, as here (those shall be welcomed to him who have no
such presents to bring), but our hearts and sincere affections, our
whole selves, we must present to him as living sacrifices. 2. That what
God blesses us with we must honour him with. The presents of his
friends, as well as the spoils of his enemies, David dedicated unto the
Lord ([Ch1 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#011).md), that is, he laid
them up towards the building and enriching of the temple. That is most
truly and most comfortably our own which we have consecrated unto the
Lord, and which we use for his glory. Let our merchandise and our hire
be holiness to the Lord, [Isa 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#018.md).
3. That those who take God along with them whithersoever they go may
expect to prosper, and be preserved, whithersoever they go. It was said
before ([Ch1 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#006).md) and here it is
repeated ([Ch1 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#013).md) that the Lord
preserved David whithersoever he went. Those are always under the eye of
God that have God always in their eye. 4. God gives men power, not that
they may look great with it, but that they may do good with it. When
David reigned over all Israel he executed judgment and justice among all
his people, and so answered the end of his elevation. He was not so
intent on his conquests abroad as to neglect the administration of
justice at home. Herein he served the purposes of the kingdom of
providence, and of that God who sits in the throne judging right; and he
was an eminent type of the Messiah, the sceptre of whose kingdom is a
right sceptre.
