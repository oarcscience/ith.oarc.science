### [Acts Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#001.md)

[Acts](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">act 27:0</span></span>

This whole chapter is taken up with an account of Paul's voyage towards
Rome, when he was sent thither a prisoner by Festus the governor, upon
his appeal to Caesar. I. The beginning of the voyage was well enough, it
was calm and prosperous ([Act 27:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#001).md).
II. Paul gave them notice of a storm coming, but could not prevail with
them to lie by ([Act 27:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#009).md). III. As
they pursued their voyage, they met with a great deal of tempestuous
weather, which reduced them to such extremity that they counted upon
nothing but being cast away ([Act
27:12-20](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#012).md). IV. Paul assured them that
though they would not be advised by him to prevent their coming into
this danger, yet, by the good providence of God, they should be brought
safely through it, and none of them should be lost ([Act
27:21-26](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#021).md). V. At length they were at
midnight thrown upon an island, which proved to be Malta, and then they
were in the utmost danger imaginable, but were assisted by Paul's
counsel to keep the mariners in the ship, and encouraged by his comforts
to eat their meat, and have a good heart on it ([Act
27:27-36](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#027).md). VI. Their narrow escape
with their lives, when they came to shore, when the ship was wrecked,
but all the persons wonderfully preserved ([Act
27:37-44](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#037).md).

[Acts 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 27:1</span></span>

It does not appear how long it was after Paul's conference with Agrippa
that he was sent away for Rome, pursuant to his appeal to Caesar; but it
is likely they took the first convenience they could hear of to do it;
in the mean time Paul is in the midst of his friends at Caesarea - they
comforts to him, and he a blessing to them. But here we are told,

I. How Paul was shipped off for Italy: a long voyage, but there is no
remedy. He has appealed to Caesar, and to Caesar he must go: It was
determined that we should sail into Italy, for to Rome they must go by
sea; it would have been a vast way about to go by land. Hence, when the
Roman conquest of the Jewish nation is foretold, it is said ([Num
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#024).md), Ships shall come from Chittim,
that is, Italy, and shall afflict Eber, that is, the Hebrews. It was
determined by the counsel of God, before it was determined by the
counsel of Festus, that Paul should go to Rome; for, whatever man
intended, God had work for him to do there. Now here we are told, 1.
Whose custody he was committed to - to one named Julius, a centurion of
Augustus's band, as Cornelius was of the Italian band, or legion, [Act
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#001.md). He had soldiers under him, who
were a guard upon Paul, that he might not make his escape, and likewise
to protect him, that he might have no mischief done him. 2. What bottom
he embarked in: they went on board a ship of Adramyttium ([Act
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#002).md), a sea-port of Africa, whence
this ship brought African goods, and, as it should seem, made a coasting
voyage for Syria, where those goods came to a good market. 3. What
company he had in this voyage, there were some prisoners who were
committed to the custody of the same centurion, and who probably had
appealed to Caesar too, or were upon some other account removed to Rome,
to be tried there, or to be examined as witnesses against some prisoners
there; perhaps some notorious offenders, like Barabbas, who were
therefore ordered to be brought before the emperor himself. Paul was
linked with these, as Christ with the thieves that were crucified with
him, and was obliged to take his lot with them in this voyage; and we
find in this chapter ([Act 27:42](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#042).md) that
for their sakes he had like to have been killed, but for his sake they
were preserved. Note, It is no new thing for the innocent to be numbered
among the transgressors. But he had also some of his friends with him,
Luke particularly, the penman of this book, for he puts himself in all
along, We sailed into Italy, and, We launched, v. 2. Aristarchus a
Thessalonian is particularly named, as being now in his company. Dr.
Lightfoot thinks that Trophimus the Ephesian went off with him, but that
he left him sick at Miletum ([Ti2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020).md), when he passed by those coasts
of Asia mentioned here (v. 2), and that there likewise he left Timothy.
It was a comfort to Paul to have the society of some of his friends in
this tedious voyage, with whom he might converse freely, though he had
so much loose profane company about him. Those that go long voyages at
sea are commonly necessitated to sojourn, as it were, in Mesech and
Kedar, and have need of wisdom, that they may do good to the bad company
they are in, may make them better, or at lest be made never the worse by
them.

II\. What course they steered, and what places they touched at, which
are particularly recorded for the confirming of the truth of the history
to those who lived at that time, and could by their own knowledge tell
of their being at such and such a place. 1. They touched at Sidon, not
far off from where they went on board; thither they came the next day.
And that which is observable here is, that Julius the centurion was
extraordinarily civil to Paul. It is probable that he knew his case, and
was one of the chief captains, or principal men, that heard him plead
his own cause before Agrippa ([Act
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#023).md), and was convinced of his
innocency, and the injury done him; and therefore, though Paul was
committed to him as a prisoner, he treated him as a friend, as a
scholar, as a gentleman, and as a man that had an interest in heaven: He
gave him liberty, while the business of the ship detained it at Sidon,
to go among his friends there, to refresh himself; and it would be a
great refreshment to him. Julius herein gives an example to those in
power to be respectful to those whom they find worthy of their respect,
and in using their power to make a difference. A Joseph, a Paul, are not
to be used as common prisoners. God herein encourages those that suffer
for him to trust in him; for he can put it into the hearts of those to
befriend them from whom they least expect it - can cause them to be
pitied, nay, can cause them to be prized and valued, even in the eyes of
those that carry them captive, [Psa
106:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#046.md). And it is likewise an instance
of Paul's fidelity. He did not go about to make his escape, which he
might have easily done; but, being out upon his parole of honour, he
faithfully returns to his imprisonment. If the centurion is so civil as
to take his word, he is so just and honest as to keep his word. 2. They
thence sailed under Cyprus, [Act 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#004.md).
If the wind had been fair, they had gone forward by direct sailing, and
had left Cyprus on the right hand; but, the wind not favouring them,
they were driven to oblique sailing with a side wind, and so compassed
the island, in a manner, and left it on the left hand. Sailors must do
as they can, when they cannot do as they would, and make the best of
their wind, whatever point it is in; so must we all in our passage over
the ocean of this world. When the winds are contrary yet we must be
getting forward as well as we can. 3. At a port called Myra they changed
their ship; that which they were in, it is probable, having business no
further, they went on board a vessel of Alexandria bound for Italy, [Act
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#005.md), [Act
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#006.md). Alexandria was now the chief
city of Egypt, and great trading there was between that city and Italy;
from Alexandria they carried corn to Rome, and the East-India goods and
Persian which they imported at the Red Sea they exported again to all
parts of the Mediterranean, and especially to Italy. And it was a
particular favour shown to the Alexandrian ships in the ports of Italy
that they were not obliged to strike sail, as other ships were, when
they came into port. 4. With much ado they made The Fair Havens, a port
of the island of Crete, [Act 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#007.md),
[Act 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#008.md). They sailed slowly many
days, being becalmed, or having the wind against them. It was a great
while before they made the point of Cnidus, a port of Caria, and were
forced to sail under Crete, as before under Cyprus; much difficulty they
met with in passing by Salmone, a promontory on the eastern shore of the
island of Crete. Though the voyage hitherto was not tempestuous, yet it
was very tedious. They many that are not driven backward in their
affairs by cross providences, yet sail slowly, and do not get forward by
favourable providences. And many good Christians make this complaint in
the concerns of their souls, that they do not rid ground in their way of
heaven, but have much ado to keep their ground; they move with many
stops and pauses, and lie a great while wind-bound. Observe, The place
they came to was called The Fair Havens. Travellers say that it is known
to this day by the same name, and that it answers the name from the
pleasantness of its situation and prospect. And yet, (1.) It was not the
harbour they were bound for; it was a fair haven, but it was not their
haven. Whatever agreeable circumstances we may be in in this world, we
must remember we are not at home, and therefore we must arise and
depart; for, though it be a fair haven, it is not the desired haven,
[Psa 107:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#030). (2..md) It was not a
commodious haven to winter in, so it is said, [Act
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#012.md). It had a fine prospect, but it
lay exposed to the weather. Note, Every fair haven is not a safe haven;
nay, there may be most danger where there is most pleasure.

III\. What advice Paul gave them with reference to that part of their
voyage they had before them - it was to be content to winter where they
were, and not to think of stirring till a better season of the year. 1.
It was now a bad time for sailing; they had lost a deal of time while
they were struggling with contrary winds. Sailing was now dangerous,
because the fast was already past, that is, the famous yearly fast of
the Jews, the day of atonement, which was on the tenth day of the
seventh month, a day to afflict the soul with fasting; it was about the
20th of our September. That yearly fast was very religiously observed;
but (which is strange) we never have any mention made in all the
scripture history of the observance of it, unless it be meant here,
where it serves only to describe the season of the year. Michaelmas is
reckoned by mariners as a bad time of the year to be at sea as any
other; they complain of their Michaelmas-blasts; it was that time now
with these distressed voyagers. The harvest was past, the summer was
ended; they had not only lost time, but lost the opportunity. 2. Paul
put them in mind of it, and gave them notice of their danger ([Act
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#010).md): "I perceive" (either by notice
from God, or by observing their wilful resolution to prosecute the
voyage notwithstanding the peril of the season) "that this voyage will
be with hurt and damage; you that have effects on board are likely to
lose them, and it will be a miracle of mercy if our lives be given us
for a prey." There were some good men in the ship, and many more bad
men: but in things of this nature all things come alike to all, and
there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked. If both be in the
same ship, they both are in the same danger. 3. They would not be
advised by Paul in this matter, [Act
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#011.md). They thought him impertinent in
interposing in an affair of this nature, who did not understand
navigation; and the centurion to whom it was referred to determine it,
though himself a passenger, yet, being a man in authority, takes upon
him to overrule, though he had not been oftener at sea perhaps than
Paul, nor was better acquainted with these seas, for Paul had planted
the gospel in Crete ([Tit 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005).md), and
knew the several parts of the island well enough. But the centurion gave
more regard to the opinion of the master and owner of the ship than to
Paul's; for every man is to be credited in his own profession
ordinarily: but such a man as Paul, who was so intimate with Heaven, was
rather to be regarded in seafaring matters than the most celebrated
sailors. Note, Those know not what dangers they run themselves into who
will be governed more by human prudence than by divine revelation. The
centurion was very civil to Paul ([Act
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#003).md), and yet would not be governed
by his advice. Note, Many will show respect to good ministers that will
not take their advice, [Eze 33:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#031.md).

[Acts 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 27:12</span></span>

In these verses we have,

I. The ship putting to sea again, and pursuing her voyage at first with
a promising gale. Observe, 1. What induced them to leave the fair
havens: it was because they thought the harbour not commodious to winter
in; it was pleasant enough in summer but in the winter they lay bleak.
Or perhaps it was upon some other account incommodious; provisions
perhaps were scarce and dear there; and they ran upon a mischief to
avoid an inconvenience, as we often do. Some of the ship's crew, or of
the council that was called to advise in this matter, were for staying
there, rather than venturing to sea now that the weather was so
uncertain: it is better to be safe in an incommodious harbour than to be
lost in a tempestuous sea. But they were outvoted when it was put to the
question, and the greater part advised to depart thence also; yet they
aimed not to go far, but only to another port of the same island, here
called Phenice, and some think it was so called because the Phenicians
frequented it much, the merchants of Tyre and Sidon. It is here
described to lie towards the south-west and north-west. Probably the
haven was between the two promontories or juttings-out of land into the
sea, one of which pointed to the north-west and the other to the
south-west, by which it was guarded against the east winds. Thus hath
the wisdom of the Creator provided for the relief and safety of those
who go down to the sea in ships, and do business in great waters. In
vain had nature provided for us the waters to sail on, if it had not
likewise provided for us natural harbours to take shelter in. 2. What
encouragement they had at first to pursue their voyage. They set out
with a fair wind ([Act 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#013).md), the
south wind blew softly, upon which they should gain their point, and so
they sailed close by the coast of Crete and were not afraid of running
upon the rocks or quicksands, because the wind blew so gently. Those who
put to sea with ever so fair a gale know not what storms they may yet
meet with, and therefore must not be secure, nor take it for granted
that they have obtained their purpose, when so many accidents may happen
to cross their purpose. Let not him that girdeth on the harness boast as
though he had put it off.

II\. The ship in a storm presently, a dreadful storm. They looked at
second causes, and took their measures from the favourable hints they
gave, and imagined that because the south wind now blew softly it would
always blow so; in confidence of this, they ventured to sea, but were
soon made sensible of their folly in giving more credit to a smiling
wind than to the word of God in Paul's mouth, by which they had fair
warning given them of a storm. Observe,

1\. What their danger and distress was, (1.). There arose against them a
tempestuous wind, which was not only contrary to them, and directly in
their teeth, so that they could not get forward, but a violent wind,
which raised the waves, like that which was sent forth in pursuit of
Jonah, though Paul was following God, and going on in his duty, and not
as Jonah running away from God and his duty. This wind the sailors
called Euroclydon, a north-east wind, which upon those seas perhaps was
observed to be in a particular manner troublesome and dangerous. It was
a sort of whirlwind, for the ship is said to be caught by it, [Act
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#015.md). It was God that commanded this
wind to rise, designing to bring glory to himself, and reputation to
Paul, out of it; stormy winds being brought out of his treasuries ([Psa
135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007).md), they fulfil his word, [Psa
148:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#008). (2..md) The ship was exceedingly
tossed ([Act 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#018).md); it was kicked
like a football from wave to wave; its passengers (as it is elegantly
described, [Psa 107:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#026.md), [Psa
107:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#027).md) mount up to the heavens, go
down again to the depths, reel to and fro, stagger like a drunken man,
and are at their wits' end. The ship could not possibly bear up into the
wind, could not make her way in opposition to the wind; and therefore
they folded up their sails, which in such a storm would endanger them
rather than to them any service, and so let the ship drive, Not whither
it would, but whither it was impelled by the impetuous waves - non quo
voluit, sed quo rapit impetus undae. Ovid. Trist. It is probable that
they were very near the heaven of Phenice when this tempest arose, and
thought they should presently be in a quiet haven, and were pleasing
themselves with the thought of it, and wintering there, and lo, of a
sudden, they are in this distress. Let us therefore always rejoice with
trembling, and never expect a perfect security, nor a perpetual
security, till we come to heaven. (3.) They saw neither sun nor stars
for many days. This made the tempest the more terrible, that they were
all in the dark; and the use of the loadstone for the direction of
sailors not being then found out (so that they had no guide at all, when
they could see neither sun nor stars) made the case the more hazardous.
Thus melancholy sometimes is the condition of the people of God upon a
spiritual account. They walk in darkness and have no light. Neither sun
nor stars appear; they cannot dwell, nay, they cannot fasten, upon any
thing comfortable or encouraging; thus it may be with them, and yet
light is sown for them. (4.) They had abundance of winter-weather: No
small tempest - cheimōn ouk oligos, cold rain, and snow, and all the
rigours of that season of the year, so that they were ready to perish
for cold; and all this continued many days. See what hardships those
often undergo who are much at sea, besides the hazards of life they run;
and yet to get gain there are still those who make nothing of all this;
and it is an instance of divine Providence that it disposes some to this
employment, notwithstanding the difficulties that attend it, for the
keeping up of commerce among the nations, and the isles of the Gentiles
particularly; and Zebulun can as heartily rejoice in his going out as
Issachar in his tents. Perhaps Christ therefore chose ministers from
among seafaring men, because they had been used to endure hardness.

2\. What means they used for their own relief: they betook themselves to
all the poor shifts (for I can call them no better) that sailors in
distress have recourse to. (1.) When they could not make head against
the wind, they let the ship run adrift, finding it was to no purpose to
ply either the oar or the sail. When it is fruitless to struggle, it is
wisdom to yield. (2.) They nevertheless did what they could to avoid the
present danger; there was a little island called Clauda, and when they
were near that, though they could not pursue their voyage, they took
care to prevent their shipwreck, and therefore so ordered their matters
that they did not run against the island, but quietly ran under it, [Act
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#016). (3..md) When they were afraid they
should scarcely save the ship, they were busy to save the boat, which
they did with much ado. They had much work to come by the boat ([Act
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#016).md), but at last they took it up,
[Act 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#017.md). This might be of use in
any exigence, and therefore they made hard shift to get it into the ship
to them. (4.) They used means which were proper enough in those times,
when the art of navigation was far short of the perfection it is now
come to; they undergirded the ship, [Act
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#017.md). They bound the ship under the
bottom of it with strong cables, to keep it from bulging in the
extremity of the tempest. (5.) For fear of falling into the quicksands
they struck sail, and then let the ship go as it would. It is strange
how a ship will live at sea (so they express it), even in very stormy
weather, if it have but sea-room; and, when the sailors cannot make the
shore, it is their interest to keep as far off it as they can. (6.) The
next day they lightened the ship of its cargo, threw the goods and the
merchandises overboard (as Jonah's mariners did, [Jon
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#005).md), being willing rather to be poor
without them than to perish with them. Skin for skin, and all that a man
has, will he give for his life. See what the wealth of this world is;
how much soever it is courted as a blessing, the time may come when it
will be a burden, not only too heavy to be carried safe of itself, but
heavy enough to sink him that has it. Riches are often kept by the
owners thereof to their hurt ([Ecc
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#013).md); and parted with to their good.
But see the folly of the children of this world, they can be thus
prodigal of their goods when it is for the saving of their lives, and
yet how sparing of them in works of piety and charity, and in suffering
for Christ, though they are told by eternal Truth itself that those
shall be recompensed more than a thousand fold in the resurrection of
the just. Those went upon a principle of faith who took joyfully the
spoiling of their goods, knowing in themselves that they had in heaven a
better and a more enduring substance, [Heb
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#034.md). Any man will rather make
shipwreck of his goods than of his life; but many will rather make
shipwreck of faith and a good conscience than of their goods. (7.) The
third day they cast out the tacklings of the ship - the utensils of it,
Armamenta (so some render it), as if it were a ship of force. With us it
is common to heave the guns over-board in the extremity of a storm; but
what heavy artillery they had then which it was necessary to lighten the
ship of I do not know; and I question whether it was not then a vulgar
error among seamen thus to throw every thing into the sea, even that
which would be of great use in a storm, and no great weight.

3\. The despair which at last they were brought to ([Act
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#020).md): All hope that we should be
saved was then taken away. The storm continued, and they saw no symptoms
of its abatement; we have known very blustering weather to continue for
some weeks. The means they had used were ineffectual, so that they were
at their wits' end; and such was the consternation that this melancholy
prospect put them into that they had no heart either to eat or drink.
They had provision enough on board ([Act
27:38](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#038).md), but such bondage were they
under, through fear of death, that they could not admit the supports of
life. Why did not Paul, by the power of Christ, and in his name, lay
this storm? Why did he not say to the winds and waves, Peace, be still,
as his Master had done? Surely it was because the apostles wrought
miracles for the confirmation of their doctrine, not for the serving of
a turn for themselves or their friends.

[Acts 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 27:21</span></span>

We have here the issue of the distress of Paul and his
fellow-travellers; they escaped with their lives and that was all, and
that was for Paul's sake. We are here told ([Act
27:37](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#037).md) what number there were on board
- mariners, merchants, soldiers, prisoners, and other passengers, in all
two hundred and seventy-six souls; this is taken notice of to make us
the more concerned for them in reading the story, that they were such a
considerable number, whose lives were now in the utmost jeopardy, and
one Paul among them worth more than all the rest. We left them in
despair, giving up themselves for gone. Whether they called every man on
his God, as Jonah's mariners did, we are not told; it is well if this
laudable practice in a storm was not gone out of fashion and made a jest
of. However, Paul among these seamen was not, like Jonah among his, the
cause of the storm, but the comforter in the storm, and as much a credit
to the profession of an apostle as Jonah was a blemish to the character
of a prophet. Now here we have,

I. The encouragement Paul gave them, by assuring them, in the name of
God, that their lives should all be saved, even when, in human
appearance, all hope that they should be saved was taken away. Paul
rescued them from their despair first, that they might not die of that,
and starve themselves in that, and then they were in a fair way to be
rescued from their distress. After long abstinence, as if they were
resolved not to eat till they knew whether they should live or die, Paul
stood forth in the midst of them. During the distress hitherto Paul hid
himself among them, was one of the crowd, helped with the rest to throw
out the tackling ([Act 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#019).md), but now
he distinguished himself, and, though a prisoner, undertook to be their
counsellor and comforter.

1\. He reproves them for not taking his advice, which was to stay where
they were, in the road of Lasea ([Act
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#008).md): "You should have hearkened to
me and not have loosed from Crete, where we might have made a shift to
winter well enough, and then we should not have gained this harm and
loss, that is, we should have escaped them." Harm and loss in the world,
if sanctified to us, may be truly said to be gain; for if they wean us
from present things, and awaken us to think of a future state, we are
truly gainers by them. Observe, They did not hearken to Paul when he
warned them of their danger, and yet if they will but acknowledge their
folly, and repent of it, he will speak comfort and relief to them now
that they are in danger, so compassionate is God to those that are in
misery, though they bring themselves into it by their own incogitancy,
nay, by their own wilfulness, and contempt of admonition. Paul, before
administering comfort, will first make them sensible of their sin in not
hearkening to him, by upbraiding them with their rashness, and probably,
when he tells them of their gaining harm and loss, he reflects upon what
they promised themselves by proceeding on their voyage, that they should
gain so much time, gain this and the other point: "But," says he, "you
have gained nothing but harm and loss; how will you answer it?" That
which they are blamed for is their loosing from Crete, where they were
safe. Note, Most people bring themselves into inconvenience, because
they do not know when they are well off, but gain harm and loss by
aiming against advice to better themselves.

2\. He assures them that though they should lose the ship yet they
should none of them lose their lives: "You see your folly in not being
ruled by me:" he does not say, "Now therefore expect to fare
accordingly, you may thank yourselves if you be all lost, those that
will not be counselled cannot be helped." No, "Yet now there is hope in
Israel concerning this thing; your case is sad, but it is not desperate,
now, I exhort you to be of good cheer." Thus we say to sinners that are
convinced of their sin and folly, and begin to see and bewail their
error, "You should have hearkened unto us, and should have had nothing
to do with sin; yet now we exhort you to be of good cheer: though you
would not take our advice when we said, Do not presume, yet take it now
when we say, Do not despair." They had given up the cause, and would use
no further means, because all hope that they should be saved was taken
away. Now Paul quickens them to bestir themselves yet in working for
their own safety, by telling them that it they would resume their vigour
they should secure their lives. He gives them this assurance when they
were brought to the last extremity, for now it would be doubly welcome
to them to be told that not a life should be lost when they were ready
to conclude they must inevitably be all lost. He tells them, (1.) That
they must count upon the loss of the ship. Those who were interested in
that and the goods were probably those greater part that were for
pushing forward the voyage and running the venture, notwithstanding
Paul's admonition, and they are made to pay for their rashness. Their
ship shall be wrecked. Many a stately, strong, rich, gallant ship is
lost in the mighty waters in a little time; for vanity of vanities, all
is vanity and vexation of spirit. But, (2.) Not a life shall be lost.
This would be good news to those that were ready to die for fear of
dying, and whose guilty consciences made death look very terrible to
them.

3\. He tells them what ground he had for this assurance, that it is not
a banter upon them, to put them into humour, nor a human conjecture, he
has a divine revelation for it, and is as confident of it as that God is
true, being fully satisfied that he has his word for it. An angel of the
Lord appeared to him in the night, and told him that for his sake they
should all be preserved ([Act
27:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#023).md), which would double the
mercy of their preservation, that they should have it not only by
providence, but by promise, and as a particular favour to Paul. Now
observe here,

(1.) The solemn profession Paul makes of relation to God, the God from
whom he had this favourable intelligence: It is he whose I am, and whom
I serve. He looks upon God, \[1.\] As his rightful owner, who has a
sovereign incontestable title to him, and dominion over him: Who I am.
Because God made us and not we ourselves, therefore we are not our own
but his. His we are by creation, for he made us; by preservation, for he
maintains us; by redemption, for he bought us. We are more his than our
own. \[2.\] As his sovereign ruler and master, who, having given him
being, has right to give him law: Whom I serve. Because his we are,
therefore we are bound to serve him, to devote ourselves to his honour
and employ ourselves in his work. It is Christ that Paul here has an eye
to; he is God, and the angels are his and go on his errands. Paul often
calls himself a servant of Jesus Christ; he is his, and him he serves,
both as a Christian and as an apostle; he does not say, "Whose we are,
and whom we serve," for most that were present were strangers to him,
but, "Whose I am, and whom I serve, whatever others do; nay, whom I am
now in the actual service of, going to Rome, not as you are, upon
worldly business, but to appear as a witness for Christ." Now this he
tells the company, that, seeing their relief coming from his God whose
he was and whom he served, they might thereby be drawn in to take him
for their God, and to serve him likewise; for the same reason Jonah said
to his mariners, I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, who has made the
sea and the dry land, [Jon 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#009.md).

(2.) The account he gives of the vision he had: There stood by me this
night an angel of God, a divine messenger who used formerly to bring him
messages from heaven; he stood by him, visibly appeared to him, probably
when he was awake upon his bed. Though he was afar off upon the sea
([Psa 65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005).md), on the uttermost parts of
the sea ([Psa 139:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#009).md), yet this could
not intercept his communion with God, nor deprive him of the benefit of
divine visits. Thence he can direct a prayer to God, and thither God can
direct an angel to him. He knows not where he is himself, yet God's
angel knows where to find him out. The ship is tossed with winds and
waves, hurried to and fro with the utmost violence, and yet the angel
finds a way into it. No storms nor tempests can hinder the
communications of God's favour to his people, for he is a very present
help, a help at hand, even when the sea roars and is troubled, [Psa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001.md), [Psa
46:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#003.md). We may suppose that Paul, being
a prisoner, had not a cabin of his own in the ship, much less a bed in
the captain's cabin, but was put down into the hold (any dark or dirty
place was thought good enough for him in common with the rest of the
prisoners), and yet there the angel of God stood by him. Meanness and
poverty set none at a distance from God and his favour. Jacob, when he
has no pillow but a stone, no curtains but the clouds, yet has a vision
of angels. Paul had this vision but this last night. He had himself been
assured by a former vision that he should go to Rome ([Act
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#011).md), from which he might infer that
he himself should be safe; but he has this fresh vision to assure him of
the safety of those with him.

(3.) The encouragements that were given him in the vision, [Act
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#014.md). \[1.\] He is forbidden to fear.
Though all about him are at their wits' end, and lost in despair, yet,
Fear not, Paul; fear not their fear, nor be afraid, [Isa
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#012.md). Let the sinners in Zion be
afraid, but let not the saints be afraid, no, not at sea, in a storm;
for the Lord of hosts is with them, and their place of defence shall be
the munitions of rocks, [Isa 33:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014.md).
\[2.\] He is assured that for his part he shall come safely to Rome:
Thou must be brought before Caesar. As the rage of the most potent
enemies, so the rage of the most stormy sea, cannot prevail against
God's witnesses till they have finished their testimony. Paul must be
preserved in this danger, for he is reserved for further service. This
is comfortable for the faithful servants of God in straits and
difficulties, that as long as God has any work for them to do their
lives shall be prolonged. \[3.\] That for his sake all that were in the
ship with him should be delivered too from perishing in this storm: God
hath given thee all those that sail with thee. The angel that was
ordered to bring him this message could have singled him out from this
wretched crew, and those that were his friends too, and have carried
them safely to shore, and have left the rest to perish, because they
would not take Paul's counsel. But God chooses rather, by preserving
them all for his sake, to show what great blessings good men are to the
world, than by delivering him only to show how good men are
distinguished from the world. God has given thee all those that sail
with thee, that is, spares them in answer to thy prayers, or for thy
sake. Sometimes good men deliver neither sons nor daughters, but their
own souls only, [Eze 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#018.md). But Paul
here delivers a whole ship's crew, almost three hundred souls. Note, God
often spares wicked people for the sake of the godly; as Zoar for Lot's
sake, and as Sodom might have been, if there had been ten righteous
persons in it. The good people are hated and persecuted in the world as
if they were not worthy to live in it, yet really it is for their sakes
that the world stands. If Paul had thrust himself needlessly into bad
company, he might justly have been cast away with them, but, God calling
him into it, they are preserved with him. And it is intimated that it
was a great favour to Paul, and he looked upon it to be so, that others
were saved for his sake: They are given thee. There is no greater
satisfaction to a good man than to know that he is a public blessing.

4\. He comforts them with the same comforts wherewith he himself was
comforted ([Act 27:25](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#025).md): "Wherefore,
Sirs, be of good cheer, you shall see even this will end well; for I
believe God, and depend upon his word, that it shall be even as it was
told me." He would not require them to give credit to that to which he
did not himself give credit; and therefore solemnly professes that he
believes it himself, and the belief of it makes him easy: "I doubt not
but it shall be as it was told me." Thus he staggers not at the promise
of God through unbelief. Hath God spoken, and shall he not make it good?
No doubt he can, no doubt he will; for he is not a man that he should
lie. And shall it be as God hath said? Then be of good cheer, be of good
courage. God is ever faithful, and therefore let all that have an
interest in his promise be ever cheerful. if with God saying and doing
are not two things, then with us believing and enjoying should not.

5\. He gives them a sign, telling them particularly what this
tempestuous voyage would issue in ([Act
27:26](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#026).md): "We must be cast upon a
certain island, and that will both break the ship and save the
passengers; and so the prediction in both respects will be fulfilled."
The pilot had quitted his post, the ship was left to run at random, they
knew not what latitude they were in, much less how to steer their
course; and yet Providence undertakes to bring them to an island that
shall be a refuge for them. When the church of God, like this ship, is
tossed with tempests, and not comforted, when there is none to guide her
of all her sons, yet God can bring her safely to shore, and will do it.

II\. Their coming at length to an anchor upon an unknown shore, [Act
27:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#027.md). 1. They had been a full
fortnight in the storm, continually expecting death: The fourteenth
night, and not sooner, they came near land; they were that night driven
up and down in Adria, not in the Adriatic Gulf on which Venice stands,
but in the Adriatic Sea, a part of the Mediterranean, containing both
the Sicilian and Ionian seas, and extending to the African shore; in
this sea they were tossed, and knew not whereabouts they were. 2. About
midnight the mariners apprehended that they drew near to some shore,
which confirmed what Paul had told them, that they must be driven upon
some island. To try whether it was so or no, they sounded, in order to
their finding the depth of the water, for the water would be shallower
as they drew nearer to shore; by the first experiment they found they
drew twenty fathoms deep of water, and by the next fifteen fathoms,
which was a demonstration that they were near some shore; God has wisely
ordered such a natural notice to sailors in the dark, that they may be
cautious. 3. They took the hint, and, fearing rocks near the shore, they
cast anchor, and wished for the day; they durst not go forward for fear
of rocks, and yet would not go back in hope of shelter, but they would
wait for the morning, and heartily wished for it; who can blame them
when the affair came to a crisis? When they had light, there was no land
to be seen; now that there was land near them, they had no light to see
it by; no marvel then they wished for day. When those that fear God walk
in darkness, and have no light, yet let them not say, The Lord has
forsaken us, or, Our God has forgotten us; but let them do as these
mariners did, cast anchor, and wish for the day, and be assured that the
day will dawn. Hope is an anchor of the soul, sure and stedfast,
entering into that within the veil. Hold fast by that, think not of
putting to sea again, but abide by Christ, and wait till the day break,
and the shadows flee away.

III\. The defeating of the sailors' attempt to quit the ship; here was a
new danger added to their distress, which they narrowly escaped.
Observe, 1. The treacherous design of the seamen, and that was to leave
the sinking ship, which, though a piece of wisdom in others, yet in
those that were entrusted with the care of it was the basest fraud that
could be ([Act 27:30](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#030).md): They were about
to flee out of the ship, concluding no other than that when it ran
ashore it must be broken all to pieces; having the command of the boat,
the project was to get all of them into that, and so save themselves,
and leave all the rest to perish. To cover this vile design, they
pretended they would cast anchors out of the fore-ship, or carry them
further off, and in order to this they let down the boat, which they had
taken in ([Act 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#016.md), [Act
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#017).md), and were going into it, having
agreed among themselves, when they were in to make straight for the
shore. The treacherous seamen are like the treacherous shepherd, who
flees when he sees the danger coming, and there is most need of his
help, [Joh 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#012.md). Thus true is that of
Solomon, Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a
broken tooth or a foot out of joint. Let us therefore cease from man.
Paul had, in God's name, assured them that they should come safely to
land, but they will rather trust their own refuge of lies than God's
word and truth. 2. Paul's discovery of it, and protestation against it,
[Act 27:31](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#031.md). They all saw them
preparing to go into the boat, but were deceived by the pretence they
made; only Paul saw through it, and gave notice to the centurion and the
soldiers concerning it, and told them plainly, Except these abide in the
ship, you cannot be saved. The skill of a mariner is seen in a storm,
and, in the distress of the ship, then is the proper time for him to
exert himself. Now the greatest difficulty of all was before them, and
therefore the seamen were now more necessary than ever yet; it was
indeed not by any skill of theirs that they were brought to land, for it
was quite beyond their skill, but, now that they are near land, they
must use their art to bring the ship to it. When God has done that for
us which we could not, we must then in his strength help ourselves. Paul
speaks humanly, when he says, You cannot be saved except these abide in
the ship; and he does not at all weaken the assurances he had divinely
given that they should infallibly be saved. God, who appointed the end,
that they should be saved, appointed the means, that they should be
saved by the help of these seamen; though, if they had gone off, no
doubt God would have made his word good some other way. Paul speaks as a
prudent man, not as a prophet, when he says, These are necessary to your
preservation. Duty is ours, events are God's; and we do not trust God,
but tempt him, when we say, "We put ourselves under his protection," and
do not use proper means, such as are within our power, for our own
preservation. 3. The effectual defeat of it by the soldiers, [Act
27:32](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#032.md). It was not time to stand
arguing the case with the seamen, and therefore they made no more ado,
but cut the ropes of the boat, and though it might otherwise have done
them service in their present distress, they chose rather to let it fall
off, and lose it, than suffer it to do them this disservice. And now the
seamen, being forced to stay in the ship whether they would or no, are
forced likewise to work for the safety of the ship as hard as they
could, because if the rest perish they must perish with them.

IV\. The new life which Paul put into the company, by cheerfully
inviting them to take some refreshment, and by the repeated assurances
he gave them that they should all of them have their lives given them
for a prey. Happy they who had such a one as Paul in their company, who
not only had correspondence with Heaven, but was of a hearty lively
spirit with those about him, that sharpened the countenance of his
friend, as iron sharpens iron. Such a friend in distress, when without
are fightings and within are fears, is a friend indeed. Ointment and
perfume rejoice the heart; so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by
hearty counsel, [Pro 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#009.md). Such was
Paul's here to his companions in tribulation. The day was coming on:
those that wish for the day, let them wait awhile, and they shall have
what they wish for. The dawning of the day revived them a little, and
then Paul got them together. 1. He chid them for their neglect of
themselves, that they had so far given way to fear and despair as to
forget or not to mind their food: This is the fourteenth day that you
have tarried, and continued fasting, having taken nothing; and that is
not well, [Act 27:33](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#033.md). Not that they
had all, or any of them, continued fourteen days without any food, but
they had not had any set meal, as they used to have, all that time; they
ate very little, next to nothing. Or, "You have continued fasting, that
is, you have lost your stomach; you have had no appetite at all to your
food, nor any relish of it, through prevailing fear and despair." A very
disconsolate state is thus expressed ([Psa
102:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#004).md), I forget to eat my bread. It
is a sin to starve the body, and to deny it its necessary supports; he
is an unnatural man indeed that hateth his own flesh, and does not
nourish and cherish it; and it is a sore evil under the sun to have a
sufficiency of the good things of this life, and not to have power to
use them, [Ecc 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#002.md). If this arise from
the sorrow of the world, and from any inordinate fear or trouble, it is
so far from excusing it that it is another sin, it is discontent, it is
distrust of God, it is all wrong. What folly is it to die for fear of
dying! But thus the sorrow of the world works death, while joy in God is
life and peace in the greatest distresses and dangers. 2. He courts them
to their food ([Act 27:34](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#034).md): "Wherefore
I pray you to take some meat. We have a hard struggle before us, must
get to shore as well as we can; if our bodies be weak through fasting,
we shall not be able to help ourselves." The angel bade Elijah, Arise
and eat, for otherwise he would find the journey too great for him, [Kg1
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#007.md). So Paul will have these people
eat, or otherwise the waves will be too hard for them: I pray you,
parakalō, "I exhort you, if you will be ruled by me, take some
nourishment; though you have no appetite to it, though you have fasted
away your stomach, yet let reason bring you to it, for this is for your
health, or rather your preservation, or safety, at this time; it is for
your salvation, you cannot without nourishment have strength to shift
for your lives." As he that will not labour, let him not eat; so he that
means to labour must eat. Weak and trembling Christians, that give way
to doubts and fears about their spiritual state, continue fasting from
the Lord's supper, and fasting from divine consolations, and then
complain they cannot go on in their spiritual work and warfare; and it
is owing to themselves. If they would feed and feast as they ought, upon
the provision Christ has made for them, they would be strengthened, and
it would be for their souls' health and salvation. 3. He assures them of
their preservation: There shall not a hair fall from the head of any of
you. It is a proverbial expression, denoting a complete indemnity. It is
used [Kg1 1:51](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#051.md); [Luk
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#018.md). "You cannot eat for fear of
dying; I tell you, you are sure of living, and therefore eat. You will
come to shore wet and cold, but sound wind and limb; your hair wet, but
not a hair lost." 4. He himself spread their table for them; for none of
them had any heart to do it, they were all so dispirited: When he had
thus spoken, he took bread, fetched it from the ship's stores, to which
every one might safely have access when none of them had an appetite.
They were not reduced to short allowance, as sailors sometimes are when
they are kept longer at sea than they expected by distress of weather;
they had plenty, but what good did that do them, when they had no
stomach? We have reason to be thankful to God that we have not only food
to our appetite, but appetite to our food; that our soul abhors not even
dainty meat ([Job 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#020).md), through
sickness or sorrow. 5. He was chaplain to the ship, and they had reason
to be proud of their chaplain. He gave thanks to God in presence of them
all. We have reason to think he had often prayed with Luke and
Arisatarchus, and what others there were among them that were
Christians, that they prayed daily together; but whether he had before
this prayed with the whole company promiscuously is not certain. Now he
gave thanks to God, in presence of them all, that they were alive, and
had been preserved hitherto, and that they had a promise that their
lives should be preserved in the imminent peril now before them; he gave
thanks for the provision they had, and begged a blessing upon it. We
must in every thing give thanks; and must particularly have an eye to
God in receiving our food, for it is sanctified to us by the word of God
and prayer, and is to be received with thanksgiving. Thus the curse is
taken off from it, and we obtain a covenant-right to it and a
covenant-blessing upon it, [Ti1 4:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#003.md).
And it is not by bread alone that man lives, but by the word of God,
which must be met with prayer. He gave thanks in presence of them all,
not only to show that he served a Master he was not ashamed of, but to
invite them into his service too. If we crave a blessing upon our meat,
and give thanks for it in a right manner, we shall not only keep up a
comfortable communion with God ourselves, but credit our profession, and
recommend it to the good opinion of others. 6. He set them a good
example: When he had given thanks, he broke the bread (it was
sea-biscuit) and he began to eat. Whether they would be encouraged or
no, he would; if they would be sullen, and, like froward children,
refuse their victuals because they had not every thing to their mind, he
would eat his meat, and be thankful. Those that teach others are
inexcusable if they do not themselves do as they teach, and the most
effectual way of preaching is by example. 7. It had a happy influence
upon them all ([Act 27:36](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#036).md): Then were
they all of good cheer. They then ventured to believe the message God
sent them by Paul when they plainly perceived that Paul believed it
himself, who was in the same common danger with them. Thus God sends
good tidings to the perishing world of mankind by those who are of
themselves, and in the same common danger with themselves, who are
sinners too, and must be saved, if ever they be saved, in the same way
in which they persuade others to venture; for it is a common salvation
which they bring the tidings of; and it is an encouragement to people to
commit themselves to Christ as their Saviour when those who invite them
to do so make it to appear that they do so themselves. It is here upon
this occasion that the number of the persons is set down, which we took
notice of before: they were in all two hundred threescore and sixteen
souls. See how many may be influenced by the good example of one. They
did all eat, nay, they did all eat enough ([Act
27:38](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#038).md), they were satiated with food,
or filled with it; they made a hearty meal. This explains the meaning of
their fasting before for fourteen days; not that they did not eat during
all that time, but they never had enough all that time, as they had now.
8. They once more lightened the ship, that it might escape the better in
the shock it was now to have. They had before thrown the wares and the
tackle overboard, and now the wheat, the victuals and provisions they
had; better they should sink the food than that it should sink them. See
what good reason our Saviour had to call our bodily food meat that
perishes. We may ourselves be under a necessity of throwing that away to
save our lives which we had gathered and laid up for the support of our
lives. It is probable that the ship was overloaded with the multitude of
the passengers (for this comes in just after the account of the number
of them) and that this obliged them so often to lighten the ship.

V. Their putting to shore, and the staving of the ship in the adventure.
It was about break of day when they ate their meat, and when it was
quite day they began to look about them; and here we are told, 1. That
they knew not where they were; they could not tell what country it was
they were now upon the coast of, whether it was Europe, Asia, or Africa,
for each had shores washed by the Adriatic Sea. It is probable that
these seamen had often sailed this way, and thought they knew every
country they came near perfectly well, and yet here they were at a loss.
Let not the wise man then glory in his wisdom, since it may perhaps fail
him thus egregiously even in his own profession. 2. They observed a
creek with a level shore, into which they hoped to thrust the ship, [Act
27:39](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#039.md). Though they knew not what
country it was, nor whether the inhabitants were friends or foes, civil
or barbarous, they determined to cast themselves upon their mercy; it
was dry land, which would be very welcome to those that had been so long
at sea. It was a pity but they had had some help from the shore, a pilot
sent them, that knew the coast, who might steer their ship in, or
another second ship, to take some of the men on board. Those who live on
the sea-coast have often opportunity of succouring those who are in
distress at sea, and of saving precious lives, and they ought to do
their utmost in order to it, with all readiness and cheerfulness; for it
is a great sin, and very provoking to God, to forbear to deliver those
that are driven unto death, and are ready to be slain; and it will not
serve for an excuse to say, Behold, we knew it not, when either we did,
or might, and should, have known it, [Pro
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#011.md), [Pro
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#012.md). I have been told there are
some, and in our own nation too, who when from the sea-coast they see a
ship in distress and at a loss will, by misguiding fires or otherwise,
purposely lead them into danger, that the lives may be lost, and they
may have the plunder of the ship. One can scarcely believe that any of
the human species can possibly be so wicked, so barbarously inhuman, and
can have so much of the devil in them; if there be, let them know of a
truth that they shall have judgment without mercy who have shown no
mercy. 3. They made straight to the shore with wind and tide ([Act
27:40](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#040).md): They took up the anchors, the
four anchors which they cast out of the stern, [Act
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#029.md). Some think that they took pains
to weigh them up, hoping they should have use for them again at the
shore; others that they did it with such precipitation that they were
forced to cut the cables and leave them; the original will admit either.
They then committed themselves to the sea, the wind standing fair to
carry them into the port, and they loosed the rudder-bands, which were
fastened during the storm for the greater steadiness of the ship, but,
now that they were putting into the port, were loosed, that the pilot
might steer with the greater freedom; they then hoisted up the main-sail
to the wind, and made towards shore. The original words here used for
the rudder-bands and the main-sail find the critics a great deal of work
to accommodate them to the modern terms; but they need not give us any
difficulty who are content to know that when they saw the shore they
hastened to it as fast as they could, and perhaps made more haste than
good speed. And should not a poor soul that has long been struggling
with winds and tempests in this world long to put into the safe and
quiet haven of everlasting rest? Should it not get clear from all that
which fastens it to this earth, and straitens the out-goings of its
pious and devout affections heavenward? And should it not hoist up the
main-sail of faith to the wind of the Spirit, and so with longing
desires make to shore? 4. They made a shift among them to run the ship
aground, in a shelf or bed of sand, as it should seem, or an isthmus, or
neck of land, washed with the sea on both sides, and therefore two seas
are said to meet upon it, and there the forepart stuck fast; and then,
when it had no liberty to play, as a ship has when it rides at anchor,
but remained immovable, the hinder part would soon be broken of course
by the violence of the waves. Whether the seamen did not do their part,
being angry that they were disappointed in their design to escape, and
therefore wilfully ran the ship aground, or whether we may suppose that
they did their utmost to save it, but God in his providence overruled,
for the fulfilling of Paul's word, that the ship must be lost ([Act
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#022).md), I cannot say; but this we are
sure of that God will confirm the word of his servants, and perform the
counsel of his messengers, [Isa 44:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#026.md).
The ship, that had strangely weathered the storm in the vast ocean,
where it had room to roll, is dashed to pieces when it sticks fast. Thus
if the heart fixes in the world, in love and affection, and adherence to
it, it is lost. Satan's temptations beat against it, and it is gone;
but, as long as it keeps above the world, though it be tossed with its
cares and tumults, there is hope of it. They had the shore in view, and
yet suffered shipwreck in the harbour, to teach us never to be secure.

VI\. A particular danger that Paul and the rest of the prisoners were
in, besides their share in the common calamity, and their deliverance
from it. 1. In this critical moment, when every man hung in doubt of his
life, the soldiers advised the killing of the prisoners that were
committed to their custody, and whom they were to give an account of,
lest any of them should swim out and escape, [Act
27:42](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#042.md). There was no great danger of
that, for they could not escape far, weak and weary as they were; and,
under the eye of so many soldiers that had the charge of them, it was
not likely they should attempt it; and if it should so happen, though
they might be obnoxious to the law for a permissive escape, yet in such
a case as this equity would certainly relieve them. But it was a brutish
barbarous motion, and so much the worse that they were thus prodigal of
other people's lives when without a miracle of mercy they must lose
their own. 2. The centurion, for Paul's sake, quashed this motion
presently. Paul, who was his prisoner, had found favour with him, as
Joseph with the captain of the guard. Julius, though he despised Paul's
advice ([Act 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#011).md), yet afterwards
saw a great deal of cause to respect him, and therefore, being willing
to save Paul, he prevented the execution of that bloody project, and in
favorem vitae - from a regard to his life, he kept them from their
purpose. It does not appear that they were any of them malefactors
convicted, but only suspected, and waiting their trial, and in such a
case as this better ten guilty ones should escape than one that was
innocent be slain. As God had saved all in the ship for Paul's sake, so
here the centurion saves all the prisoners for his sake; such a
diffusive good is a good man.
