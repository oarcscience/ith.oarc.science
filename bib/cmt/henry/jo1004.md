### [1 John Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001.md)

[1 John](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jo1 4:0</span></span>

In this chapter the apostle exhorts to try spirits ([Jo1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001).md), gives a note to try by ([Jo1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002.md), [Jo1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#003).md), shows who are of the world and
who of God ([Jo1 4:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004).md), urges
Christian love by divers considerations ([Jo1
4:7-16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007).md), describes our love to God,
and the effect of it ([Jo1 4:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017).md).

[1 John 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo1 4:1</span></span>

The apostle, having said that God's dwelling in and with us may be known
by the Spirit that he hath given us, intimates that that Spirit may be
discerned and distinguished from other spirits that appear in the world;
and so here,

I. He calls the disciples, to whom he writes, to caution and scrutiny
about the spirits and spiritual professors that had now risen. 1. To
caution: "Beloved, believe not every spirit; regard not, trust not,
follow not, every pretender to the Spirit of God, or every professor of
vision, or inspiration, or revelation from God." Truth is the foundation
of simulation and counterfeits; there had been real communications from
the divine Spirit, and therefore others pretended thereto. God will take
the way of his own wisdom and goodness, though it may be liable to
abuse; he has sent inspired teachers to the world, and given us a
supernatural revelation, though others may be so evil and so impudent as
to pretend the same; every pretender to the divine Spirit, or to
inspiration, and extraordinary illumination thereby, is not to be
believed. Time was when the spiritual man (the man of the Spirit, who
made a great noise about, and boast of, the Spirit) was mad, [Hos
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007.md). 2. To scrutiny, to examination of
the claims that are laid to the Spirit: But try the spirits, whether
they be of God, [Jo1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001.md). God has
given of his Spirit in these latter ages of the world, but not to all
who profess to come furnished therewith; to the disciples is allowed a
judgment of discretion, in reference to the spirits that would be
believed and trusted in the affairs of religion. A reason is given for
this trial: Because many false prophets have gone out into the world,
[Jo1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001.md). There being much about the
time of our Saviour's appearance in the world a general expectation
among the Jews of a Redeemer to Israel, and the humiliation, spiritual
reformation, and sufferings of the Saviour being taken as a prejudice
against him, others were induced to set up as prophets and messiahs to
Israel, according to the Saviour's prediction, [Mat
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#023.md), [Mat
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024.md). It should not seem strange to
us that false teachers set themselves up in the church: it was so in the
apostles' times; fatal is the spirit of delusion, sad that men should
vaunt themselves for prophets and inspired preachers that are by no
means so!

II\. He gives a test whereby the disciples may try these pretending
spirits. These spirits set up for prophets, doctors, or dictators in
religion, and so they were to be tried by their doctrine; and the test
whereby in that day, or in that part of the world where the apostle now
resided (for in various seasons, and in various churches, tests were
different), must be this: Hereby know you the Spirit of God, Every
spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh (or that
confesseth Jesus Christ that came in the flesh), is of God, [Jo1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002.md). Jesus Christ is to be confessed
as the Son of God, the eternal life and Word, that was with the Father
from the beginning; as the Son of God that came into, and came in, our
human mortal nature, and therein suffered and died at Jerusalem. He who
confesses and preaches this, by a mind supernaturally instructed and
enlightened therein, does it by the Spirit of God, or God is the author
of that illumination. On the contrary, "Every spirit that confesseth not
that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh (or Jesus Christ that came in
the flesh) is not of God, [Jo1 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#003.md).
God has given so much testimony to Jesus Christ, who was lately here in
the world, and in the flesh (or in a fleshly body like ours), though now
in heaven, that you may be assured that any impulse or pretended
inspiration that contradicts this is far from being from heaven and of
God." The sum of revealed religion is comprehended in the doctrine
concerning Christ, his person and office. We see then the aggravation of
a systematic opposition to him and it. And this is that spirit of
antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come, and even now
already is it in the world, [Jo1 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#003.md).
It was foreknown by God that antichrists would arise, and antichristian
spirits oppose his Spirit and his truth; it was foreknown also that one
eminent antichrist would arise, and make a long and fatal war against
the Christ of God, and his institution, and honour, and kingdom in the
world. This great antichrist would have his way prepared, and his rise
facilitated, by other less antichrists, and the spirit of error working
and disposing men's minds for him: the antichristian spirit began
betimes, even in the apostles' days. Dreadful and unsearchable is the
judgment of God, that persons should be given over to an antichristian
spirit, and to such darkness and delusion as to set themselves against
the Son of God and all the testimony that the Father hath given to the
Son! But we have been forewarned that such opposition would arise; we
should therefore cease to be offended, and the more we see the word of
Christ fulfilled the more confirmed we should be in the truth of it.

[1 John 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo1 4:4</span></span>

In these verses the apostle encourages the disciples against the fear
and danger of this seducing antichristian spirit, and that by such
methods as these: - 1. He assures them of a more divine principle in
them: "You are of God, little children, [Jo1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004.md). You are God's little children. We
are of God, [Jo1 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#006.md). We are born of
God, taught of God, anointed of God, and so secured against infectious
fatal delusions. God has his chosen, who shall not be mortally seduced."
2. He gives them hope of victory: "And have overcome them, [Jo1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004.md). You have hitherto overcome these
deceivers and their temptations, and there is good ground of hope that
you will do so still, and that upon these two accounts:" - (1.) "There
is a strong preserver within you: Because greater is he that is in you
than he that is in the world, [Jo1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004.md). The Spirit of God dwells in you,
and that Spirit is more mighty than men of devils." It is a great
happiness to be under the influence of the Holy Ghost. (2.) "You are not
of the same temper with these deceivers. The Spirit of God hath framed
your mind for God and heaven; but they are of the world. The spirit that
prevails in them leads them to this world; their heart is addicted
thereto; they study the pomp, the pleasure, and interest of the world:
and therefore speak they of the world; they profess a worldly messiah
and saviour; they project a worldly kingdom and dominion; the
possessions and treasures of the world would they engross to themselves,
forgetting that the true Redeemer's kingdom is not of this world. This
worldly design procures them proselytes: The world heareth them, [Jo1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#005.md). They are followed by such as
themselves: the world will love its own, and its own will love it. But
those are in a fair way to conquer pernicious seductions who have
conquered the love of this seducing world." Then, 3. He represents to
them that though their company might be the smaller, yet it was the
better; they had more divine and holy knowledge: "He that knoweth God
heareth us. He who knows the purity and holiness of God, the love and
grace of God, the truth and faithfulness of God, the ancient word and
prophecies of God, the signals and testimonials of God, must know that
he is with us; and he who knows this will attend to us, and abide with
us." He that is well furnished with natural religion will the more
faithfully cleave to Christianity. He that knoweth God (in his natural
and moral excellences, revelations, and works) heareth us, [Jo1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#006.md). As, on the contrary, "He that is
not of God heareth not us. He who knows not God regards not us. He that
is not born of God (walking according to his natural disposition) walks
not with us. The further any are from God (as appears in all ages) the
further they are from Christ and his faithful servants; and the more
addicted persons are to this world the more remote they are from the
spirit of Christianity. Thus you have a distinction between us and
others: Hereby know we the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error, [Jo1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#006.md). This doctrine concerning the
Saviour's person leading you from the world to God is a signature of the
Spirit of truth, in opposition to the spirit of error. The more pure and
holy any doctrine is the more likely is it to be of God."

[1 John 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo1 4:7</span></span>

As the Spirit of truth is known by doctrine (thus spirits are to be
tried), it is known by love likewise; and so here follows a strong
fervent exhortation to holy Christian love: Beloved, let us love one
another, [Jo1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007.md). The apostle would
unite them in his love, that he might unite them in love to each other:
"Beloved, I beseech you, by the love I bear to you, that you put on
unfeigned mutual love." This exhortation is pressed and urged with
variety of argument: as,

I. From the high and heavenly descent of love: For love is of God. He is
the fountain, author, parent, and commander of love; it is the sum of
his law and gospel: And every one that loveth (whose spirit is framed to
judicious holy love) is born of God, [Jo1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007.md). The Spirit of God is the Spirit
of love. The new nature in the children of God is the offspring of his
love: and the temper and complexion of it is love. The fruit of the
Spirit is love, [Gal 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022.md). Love comes
down from heaven.

II\. Love argues a true and just apprehension of the divine nature: He
that loveth knoweth God, [Jo1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007.md). He
that loveth not knoweth not God, [Jo1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#008.md). What attribute of the divine
Majesty so clearly shines in all the world as his communicative
goodness, which is love. The wisdom, the greatness, the harmony, and
usefulness of the vast creation, which so fully demonstrate his being,
do at the same time show and prove his love; and natural reason,
inferring and collecting the nature and excellence of the most absolute
perfect being, must collect and find that he is most highly good: and he
that loveth not (is not quickened by the knowledge he hath of God to the
affection and practice of love) knoweth not God; it is a convictive
evidence that the sound and due knowledge of God dwells not in such a
soul; his love must needs shine among his primary brightest perfections;
for God is love ([Jo1 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#008).md), his nature
and essence are love, his will and works are primarily love. Not that
this is the only conception we ought to have of him; we have found that
he is light as well as love ([Jo1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005).md), and God is principally love to
himself, and he has such perfections as arise from the necessary love he
must bear to his necessary existence, excellence, and glory; but love is
natural and essential to the divine Majesty: God is love. This is argued
from the display and demonstration that he hath given of it; as, 1. That
he hath loved us, such as we are: In this was manifest the love of God
towards us ([Jo1 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009).md), towards us
mortals, us ungrateful rebels. God commandeth his love towards us, in
that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us, [Rom
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#008.md). Strange that God should love
impure, vain, vile, dust and ashes! 2. That he has loved us at such a
rate, at such an incomparable value as he has given for us; he has given
his own, only-beloved, blessed Son for us: Because that God sent his
only-begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him, [Jo1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009.md). This person is in some peculiar
distinguishing way the Son of God; he is the only-begotten. Should we
suppose him begotten as a creature or created being, he is not the
only-begotten. Should we suppose him a natural necessary eradication
from the Father's glory or glorious essence, or substance, he must be
the only-begotten: and then it will be a mystery and miracle of divine
love that such a Son should be sent into our world for us! It may well
be said, So (wonderfully, so amazingly, so incredibly) God loved the
world. 3. That God loved us first, and in the circumstances in which we
lay: Herein is love (unusual unprecedented love), not that we loved God,
but that he loved us, [Jo1 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010.md). He
loved us, when we had no love for him, when we lay in our guilt, misery,
and blood, when we were undeserving, ill-deserving, polluted, and
unclean, and wanted to be washed from our sins in sacred blood. 4. That
he gave us his Son for such service and such an end. (1.) For such
service, to be the propitiation for our sins; consequently to die for
us, to die under the law and curse of God, to bear our sins in his own
body, to be crucified, to be wounded in his soul, and pierced in his
side, to be dead and buried for us ([Jo1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010)); and then, (2..md) For such an end,
for such a good and beneficial end to us - that we might live through
him ([Jo1 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009).md), might live for ever
through him, might live in heaven, live with God, and live in eternal
glory and blessedness with him and through him: O what love is here!
Then,

III\. Divine love to the brethren should constrain ours: Beloved (I
would adjure you by your interest in my love to remember), if God so
loved us, we ought also to love one another, [Jo1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#011.md). This should be an invincible
argument. The example of God should press us. We should be followers (or
imitators) of him, as his dear children. The objects of the divine love
should be the objects of ours. Shall we refuse to love those whom the
eternal God hath loved? We should be admirers of his love, and lovers of
his love (of the benevolence and complacency that are in him), and
consequently lovers of those whom he loves. The general love of God to
the world should induce a universal love among mankind. That you may be
the children of your Father who is in heaven; for he maketh his sun to
rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth his rain on the just and
on the unjust, [Mat 5:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045.md). The peculiar
love of God to the church and to the saints should be productive of a
peculiar love there: If God so loved us, we ought surely (in some
measure suitably thereto) to love one another.

IV\. The Christian love is an assurance of the divine inhabitation: If
we love one another, God dwelleth in us, [Jo1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#012.md). Now God dwelleth in us, not by
any visible presence, or immediate appearance to the eye (no man hath
seen God at any time, [Jo1 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#012).md), but
by his Spirit ([Jo1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#013).md); or, "No man
hath seen God at any time; he does not here present himself to our eye
or to our immediate intuition, and so he does not in this way demand and
exact our love; but he demands and expects it in that way in which he
has thought meet to deserve and claim it, and that is in the
illustration that he has given of himself and of his love (and thereupon
of his loveliness too) in the catholic church, and particularly in the
brethren, the members of that church. In them, and in his appearance for
them and with them, is God to be loved; and thus, if we love one
another, God dwelleth in us. The sacred lovers of the brethren are the
temples of God; the divine Majesty has a peculiar residence there."

V. Herein the divine love attains a considerable end and accomplishment
in us: "And his love is perfected in us, [Jo1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#012.md). It has obtained its completion
in and upon us. God's love is not perfected in him, but in and with us.
His love could not be designed to be ineffectual and fruitless upon us;
when its proper genuine end and issue are attained and produced thereby,
it may be said to be perfected; so faith is perfected by its works, and
love perfected by its operations. When the divine love has wrought us to
the same image, to the love of God, and thereupon to the love of the
brethren, the children of God, for his sake, it is therein and so far
perfected and completed, though this love of ours is not at present
perfect, nor the ultimate end of the divine love to us." How ambitious
should we be of this fraternal Christian love, when God reckons his own
love to us perfected thereby! To this the apostle, having mentioned the
high favour of God's dwelling in us, subjoins the note and character
thereof: Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he
hath given us of his Spirit, [Jo1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#013.md). Certainly this mutual
inhabitation is something more noble and great than we are well
acquainted with or can declare. One would think that to speak of God
dwelling in us, and we in him, were to use words too high for mortals,
had not God gone before us therein. What this indwelling imports has
been briefly explained on [Jo1 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#024.md).
What it fully is must be left to the revelation of the blessed world.
But this mutual inhabitation we know, says the apostle, because he hath
given us of his spirit; he has lodged the image and fruit of his Spirit
in our hearts ([Jo1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#013).md), and the
Spirit that he hath given us appears to be his, or of him, since it is
the Spirit of power, of zeal and magnanimity for God, of love to God and
man, and of a sound mind, of an understanding well instructed in the
affairs of God and religion, and his kingdom among men, [Ti2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#007.md).

[1 John 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jo1 4:14</span></span>

Since faith in Christ works love to God, and love to God must kindle
love to the brethren, the apostle here confirms the prime article of the
Christian faith as the foundation of such love. Here,

I. He proclaims the fundamental article of the Christian religion, which
is so representative of the love of God: And we have seen, and do
testify, that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world,
[Jo1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#014.md). We here see, 1. The Lord
Jesus's relation to God; he is Son to the Father, such a Son as no one
else is, and so as to be God with the Father. 2. His relation and office
towards us - the Saviour of the world; he saves us by his death,
example, intercession, Spirit, and power against the enemies of our
salvation. 3. The ground on which he became so - by the mission of him:
The Father sent the Son, he decreed and willed his coming hither, in and
with the consent of the Son. 4. The apostle's assurance of this - he and
his brethren had seen it; they had seen the Son of God in his human
nature, in his holy converse and works, in his transfiguration on the
mount, and in his death, resurrection from the dead, and royal ascent to
heaven; they had so seen him as to be satisfied that he was the
only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. 5. The apostle's
attestation of this, in pursuance of such evidence: "We have seen and do
testify. The weight of this truth obliges us to testify it; the
salvation of the world lies upon it. The evidence of the truth warrants
us to testify it; our eyes, and ears, and hands, have been witnesses of
it." Thereupon,

II\. The apostle states the excellency, or the excellent privilege
attending the due acknowledgment of this truth: Whosoever shall confess
that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God, [Jo1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#015.md). This confession seems to include
faith in the heart as the foundation of it, acknowledgment with the
mouth to the glory of God and Christ, and profession in the life and
conduct, in opposition to the flatteries or frowns of the world. Thus no
man says that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost, by the external
attestation and internal operation of the Holy Ghost, [Co1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003.md). And so he who thus confesses
Christ, and God in him, is enriched with or possessed by the Spirit of
God, and has a complacential knowledge of God and much holy enjoyment of
him. Then,

III\. The apostle applies this in order to the excitation of holy love.
God's love is thus seen and exerted in Christ Jesus; and thus have we
known and believed the love that God hath to us, [Jo1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016.md). The Christian revelation is,
what should endear it to us, the revelation of the divine love; the
articles of our revealed faith are but so many articles relating to the
divine love. The history of the Lord Christ is the history of God's love
to us; all his transactions in and with his Son were but testifications
of his love to us, and means to advance us to the love of God: God was
in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, [Co2
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019.md). Hence we may learn,

1\. That God is love ([Jo1 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016).md); he
is essential boundless love; he has incomparable incomprehensible love
for us of this world, which he has demonstrated in the mission and
mediation of his beloved Son. It is the great objection and prejudice
against the Christian revelation that the love of God should be so
strange and unaccountable as to give his own eternal Son for us; it is
the prejudice of many against the eternity and the deity of the Son that
so great a person should be given for us. It is, I confess, mysterious
and unsearchable; but there are unsearchable riches in Christ. It is a
pity that the vastness of the divine love should be made a prejudice
against the revelation and the belief of it. But what will not God do
when he designs to demonstrate the height of any perfection of his? When
he would show somewhat of his power and wisdom, he makes such a world as
this; when he would show more of his grandeur and glory, he makes heaven
for the ministering spirits that are before the throne. What will he not
do then when he designs to demonstrate his love, and to demonstrate his
highest love, or that he himself is love, or that love is one of the
most bright, dear, transcendent, operative excellencies of his unbounded
nature; and to demonstrate this not only to us, but to the angelic
world, and to the principalities and powers above, and this not for our
surprise for a while, but for the admiration, and praise, and adoration,
and felicity, of our most exalted powers to all eternity? What will not
God then do? Surely then it will look more agreeable to the design, and
grandeur, and pregnancy of his love (if I may so call it) to give an
eternal Son for us, than to make a Son on purpose for our relief. In
such a dispensation as that of giving a natural, essential, eternal Son
for us and to us, he will commend his love to us indeed; and what will
not the God of love do when he designs to commend his love, and to
commend it in the view of heaven, and earth, and hell, and when he will
commend himself and recommend himself to us, and to our highest
conviction, and also affection, as love itself? And what if it should
appear at last (which I shall only offer to the consideration of the
judicious) that the divine love, and particularly God's love in Christ,
should be the foundation of the glories of heaven, in the present
enjoyment of those ministering spirits that comported with it, and of
the salvation of this world, and of the torments of hell? This last will
seem most strange. But what if therein it should appear not only that
God is love to himself, in vindicating his own law, and government, and
love, and glory, but that the damned ones are made so, or are so
punished, (1.) Because they despised the love of God already manifested
and exhibited. (2.) Because they refused to be beloved in what was
further proposed and promised. (3.) Because they made themselves unmeet
to be the objects of divine complacency and delight? If the conscience
of the damned should accuse them of these things, and especially of
rejecting the highest instance of divine love, and if the far greatest
part of the intelligent creation should be everlastingly blessed through
the highest instance of the divine love, then may it well be inscribed
upon the whole creation of God, God is love.

2\. That hereupon he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in
him, [Jo1 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016.md). There is great
communion between the God of love and the loving soul; that is, him who
loves the creation of God, according to its different relation to God,
and reception from him and interest in him. He that dwells in sacred
love has the love God shed abroad upon his heart, has the impress of God
upon his spirit, the Spirit of God sanctifying and sealing him, lives in
the meditation, views, and tastes of the divine love, and will ere long
go to dwell with God for ever.

[1 John 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jo1 4:17</span></span>

The apostle, having thus excited and enforced sacred love from the great
pattern and motive of it, the love that is and dwells in God himself,
proceeds to recommend it further by other considerations; and he
recommends it in both the branches of it, both as love to God, and love
to our brother or Christian neighbour.

I. As love to God, to the primum amabile - the first and chief of all
amiable beings and objects, who has the confluence of all beauty,
excellence, and loveliness, in himself, and confers on all other beings
whatever renders them good and amiable. Love to God seems here to be
recommended on these accounts: - 1. It will give us peace and
satisfaction of spirit in the day when it will be most needed, or when
it will be the greatest pleasure and blessing imaginable: Herein is our
love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment,
[Jo1 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017.md). There must be a day of
universal judgment. Happy they who shall have holy fiducial boldness
before the Judge at that day, who shall be able to lift up their heads,
and to look him in the face, as knowing he is their friend and advocate!
Happy they who have holy boldness and assurance in the prospect of that
day, who look and wait for it, and for the Judge's appearance! So do,
and so may do, the lovers of God. Their love to God assures them of
God's love to them, and consequently of the friendship of the Son of
God; the more we love our friend, especially when we are sure that he
knows it, the more we can trust his love. As God is good and loving, and
faithful to his promise, so we can easily be persuaded of his love, and
the happy fruits of his love, when we can say, Thou that knowest all
things knowest that we love thee. And hope maketh not ashamed; our hope,
conceived by the consideration of God's love, will not disappoint us,
because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
that is given to us, [Rom 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005.md).
Possibly here by the love of God may be meant our love to God, which is
shed abroad upon our hearts by the Holy Ghost; this is the foundation of
our hope, or of our assurance that our hope will hold good at last. Or,
if by the love of God be meant the sense and apprehension of his love to
us, yet this must suppose or include us as lovers of him in this case;
and indeed the sense and evidence of his love to us do shed abroad upon
our hearts love to him; and thereupon we have confidence towards him and
peace and joy in him. He will give the crown of righteousness to all
that love his appearing. And we have this boldness towards Christ
because of our conformity to him: Because as he is so are we in this
world, [Jo1 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017.md). Love hath conformed
us to him; as he was the great lover of God and man, he has taught us in
our measure to be so too, and he will not deny his own image. Love
teaches us to conform in sufferings too; we suffer for him and with him,
and therefore cannot but hope and trust that we shall also be glorified
together with him, [Ti2 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#012.md). 2. It
prevents or removes the uncomfortable result and fruit of servile fear:
There is no fear in love ([Jo1 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#018).md);
so far as love prevails, fear ceases. We must here distinguish, I judge,
between fear and being afraid; or, in this case, between the fear of God
and being afraid of him. The fear of God is often mentioned and
commanded as the substance of religion ([Pe1
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#017.md); [Rev
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#007).md); and so it imports the high
regard and veneration we have for God and his authority and government.
Such fear is constant with love, yea, with perfect love, as being in the
angels themselves. But then there is a being afraid of God, which arises
from a sense of guilt, and a view of his vindictive perfections; in the
view of them, God is represented as a consuming fire; and so fear here
may be rendered dread; There is no dread in love. Love considers its
object as good and excellent, and therefore amiable, and worthy to be
beloved. Love considers God as most eminently good, and most eminently
loving us in Christ, and so puts off dread, and puts on joy in him; and,
as love grows, joy grows too; so that perfect love casteth out fear or
dread. Those who perfectly love God are, from his nature, and counsel,
and covenant, perfectly assured of his love, and consequently are
perfectly free from any dismal dreadful suspicions of his punitive power
and justice, as armed against them; they well know that God loves them,
and they thereupon triumph in his love. That perfect love casteth out
fear the apostle thus sensibly argues: that which casteth out torment
casteth out fear or dread: Because fear hath torment ([Jo1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#018).md) - fear is known to be a
disquieting torturing passion, especially such a fear as is the dread of
an almighty avenging God; but perfect love casteth out torment, for it
teaches the mind a perfect acquiescence and complacency in the beloved,
and therefore perfect love casteth out fear. Or, which is here
equivalent, he that feareth is not made perfect in love ([Jo1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#018).md); it is a sign that our love is
far from being perfect, since our doubts, and fears, and dismal
apprehensions of God, are so many. Let us long for, and hasten to, the
world of perfect love, where our serenity and joy in God will be as
perfect as our love! 3. From the source and rise of it, which is the
antecedent love of God: We love him, because he first loved us, [Jo1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#019.md). His love is the incentive, the
motive, and moral cause of ours. We cannot but love so good a God, who
was first in the act and work of love, who loved us when we were both
unloving and unlovely, who loved us at so great a rate, who has been
seeking and soliciting our love at the expense of his Son's blood; and
has condescended to beseech us to be reconciled unto him. Let heaven and
earth stand amazed at such love! His love is the productive cause of
ours: Of his own will (of his own free loving will) begat he us. To
those that love him all things work together for good, to those who are
the called according to his purpose. Those that love God are the called
thereto according to his purpose ([Rom
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028).md); according to whose purpose they
are called is sufficiently intimated in the following clauses: whom he
did predestinate (or antecedently purpose, to the image of his Son)
those he also called, effectually recovered thereto. The divine love
stamped love upon our souls; may the Lord still and further direct our
hearts into the love of God! [Th2 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#005.md).

II\. As love to our brother and neighbour in Christ; such love is argued
and urged on these accounts: - 1. As suitable and consonant to our
Christian profession. In the profession of Christianity we profess to
love God as the root of religion: "If then a man say, or profess as much
as thereby to say, I love God, I am a lover of his name, and house, and
worship, and yet hate his brother, whom he should love for God's sake,
he is a liar ([Jo1 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#020).md), he therein
gives his profession the lie." That such a one loves not God the apostle
proves by the usual facility of loving what is seen rather than what is
unseen: For he that loveth not his brother, whom he hath seen, how can
he love God, whom he hath not seen? [Jo1
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#020.md). The eye is wont to affect the
heart; things unseen less catch the mind, and thereby the heart. The
incomprehensibleness of God very much arises from his invisibility; the
member of Christ has much of God visible in him. How then shall the
hater of a visible image of God pretend to love the unseen original, the
invisible God himself? 2. As suitable to the express law of God, and the
just reason of it: And this commandment have we from him, that he who
loveth God love his brother also, [Jo1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#021.md). As God has communicated his
image in nature and in grace, so he would have our love to be suitably
diffused. We must love God originally and supremely, and others in him,
on the account of their derivation and reception from him, and of his
interest in them. Now, our Christian brethren having a new nature and
excellent privileges derived from God, and God having his interest in
them as well as in us, it cannot but be a natural suitable obligation
that he who loves God should love his brother also.
