### [Jeremiah Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 20:0</span></span>

Such plain dealing as Jeremiah used in the foregoing chapter, one might
easily foresee, if it did not convince and humble men, would provoke and
exasperate them; and so it did; for here we find, I. Jeremiah persecuted
by Pashur for preaching that sermon ([Jer
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001.md), [Jer
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#002).md). II. Pashur threatened for so
doing, and the word which Jeremiah had preached confirmed ([Jer
20:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#003).md). III. Jeremiah complaining to
God concerning it, and the other instances of hard measure that he had
since he began to be a prophet, and the grievous temptations he had
struggled with ([Jer 20:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007).md),
encouraging himself in God, lodging his appeal with him, not doubting
but that he shall yet praise him, by which it appears that he had much
grace ([Jer 20:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#011).md) and yet
peevishly cursing the day of his birth ([Jer
20:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014).md), by which it appears that he
had sad remainders of corruption in him too, and was a man subject to
like passions as we are.

[Jeremiah 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 20:1</span></span>

Here is, I. Pashur's unjust displeasure against Jeremiah, and the fruits
of that displeasure, [Jer 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001.md), [Jer
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#002.md). This Pashur was a priest, and
therefore, one would think, should have protected Jeremiah, who was of
his own order, a priest too, and the more because he was a prophet of
the Lord, whose interests the priests, his ministers, ought to consult.
But this priest was a persecutor of him whom he should have patronized.
He was the son of Immer; that is, he was of the sixteenth course of the
priests, of which Immer, when these courses were first settled by David,
was father ([Ch1 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#014).md), as Zechariah
was of the order of Abiah, [Luk 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#005.md).
Thus this Pashur is distinguished from another of the same name
mentioned [Jer 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md), who was of the
fifth course. This Pashur was chief governor in the temple; perhaps he
was only so pro tempore - for a short period, the course he was head of
being now in waiting, or he was suffragan to the high priest, or perhaps
captain of the temple or of the guards about it. [Act
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#001.md). This was Jeremiah's great enemy.
The greatest malignity to God's prophets was found among those that
professed sanctity and concern for God and the church. We cannot suppose
that Pashur was one of those ancients of the priests that went with
Jeremiah to the valley of Tophet to hear him prophesy, unless it were
with a malicious design to take advantage against him; but, when he came
into the courts of the Lord's house, it is probable that he was himself
a witness of what he said, and so it may be read ([Jer
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001).md), He heard Jeremiah prophesying
these things. As we read it, the information was brought to him by
others, whose examinations he took: He heard that Jeremiah prophesied
these things, and could not bear it, especially that he should dare to
preach in the courts of the Lord's house, where he was chief governor,
without his leave. When power in the church is abused, it is the most
dangerous power that can be employed against it. Being incensed at
Jeremiah, 1. He smote him, struck him with his hand or staff of
authority. Perhaps it was a blow intended only to disgrace him, like
that which the high priest ordered to be given to Paul ([Act
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#002).md), he struck him on the mouth, and
bade him hold his prating. Or perhaps he gave him many blows intended to
hurt him; he beat him severely, as a malefactor. It is charged upon the
husbandmen ([Mat 21:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#035).md) that they beat
the servants. The method of proceeding here was illegal; the high
priest, and the rest of the priests, ought to have been consulted,
Jeremiah's credentials examined, and the matter enquired into, whether
he had an authority to say what he said. But these rules of justice are
set aside and despised, as mere formalities; right or wrong, Jeremiah
must be run down. The enemies of piety would never suffer themselves to
be bound by the laws of equity. 2. He put him in the stocks. Some make
it only a place of confinement; he imprisoned him. It rather seems to be
an instrument of closer restraint, and intended to put him both to pain
and shame. Some think it was a pillory for his neck and arms; others (as
we) a pair of stocks for his legs: whatever engine it was, he continued
in it all night, and in a public place too, in the high gate of
Benjamin, which was in, or by, the house of the Lord, probably a gate
through which they passed between the city and the temple. Pashur
intended thus to chastise him, that he might deter him from prophesying;
and thus to expose him to contempt and render him odious, that he might
not be regarded if he did prophesy. Thus have the best men met with the
worst treatment from this ungracious ungrateful world; and the greatest
blessings of their age have been counted as the off-scouring of all
things. Would it not raise a pious indignation to see such a man as
Pashur upon the bench and such a man as Jeremiah in the stocks? It is
well that there is another life after this, when persons and things will
appear with another face.

II\. God's just displeasure against Pashur, and the tokens of it. On the
morrow Pashur gave Jeremiah his discharge, brought him out of the stocks
([Jer 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#003).md); it is probable that he
continued him there, in little-ease, as long as was usual to continue
any in that punishment. And now Jeremiah has a message from God to him.
We do not find that, when Pashur put Jeremiah in the stocks, the latter
gave him any check for which he did; he appears to have quietly and
silently submitted to the abuse; when he suffered, he threatened not.
But, when he brought him out of the stocks, then God put a word into the
prophet's mouth, which would awaken his conscience, if he had any. For,
when the prophet of the Lord was bound, the word of the Lord was not.
What can we think Pashur aimed at in smiting and abusing Jeremiah?
Whatever it is, we shall see by what God says to him that he is
disappointed.

1\. Did he aim to establish himself, and make himself easy, by silencing
one that told him of his faults and would be likely to lessen his
reputation with the people? He shall not gain this point; for, (1.)
Though the prophet should be silent, his own conscience shall fly in his
face and make him always uneasy. To confirm this he shall have a name
given him, Magor-missabib - Terror round about, or Fear on every side.
God himself shall give him this name, whose calling him so will make him
so. It seems to be a proverbial expression, bespeaking a man not only in
distress but in despair, not only in danger on every side (that a man
may be and yet by faith may be in no terror, as David, [Psa
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#006.md), [Psa
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#003).md), but in fear on every side, and
that a man may be when there appears no danger. The wicked flee when no
man pursues, are in great gear where no fear is. This shall be Pashur's
case ([Jer 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#004).md): "Behold, I will make
thee a terror to thyself; that is, thou shalt be subject to continual
frights, and thy own fancy and imagination shall create thee a constant
uneasiness." Note, God can make the most daring sinner a terror to
himself, and will find out a way to frighten those that frighten his
people from doing their duty. And those that will not hear of their
faults from God's prophets, that are reprovers in the gate, shall be
made to hear of them from conscience, which is a reprover in their own
bosoms that will not be daunted nor silenced. And miserable is the man
that is thus made a terror to himself. Yet this is not all; some are
very much a terror to themselves, but they conceal it and seem to others
to be pleasant; but, "I will make thee a terror to all thy friends; thou
shalt, upon all occasions, express thyself with so much horror and
amazement that all thy friends shall be afraid of conversing with thee
and shall choose to stand aloof from thy torment." Persons in deep
melancholy and distraction are a terror to themselves and all about
them, which is a good reason why we should be very thankful, so long as
God continues to us the use of our reason and the peace of our
consciences. (2.) His friends, whom he put a confidence in and perhaps
studied to oblige in what he did against Jeremiah, shall all fail him.
God does not presently strike him dead for what he did against Jeremiah,
but lets him live miserably, like Cain in the land of shaking, in such a
continual consternation that wherever he goes he shall be a monument of
divine justice; and, when it is asked, "What makes this man in such a
continual terror?" it shall be answered, "It is God's hand upon him for
putting Jeremiah in the stocks." His friends, who should encourage him,
shall all be cut off; they shall fall by the sword of the enemy, and his
eyes shall behold it, which dreadful sight shall increase his terror.
(3.) He shall find, in the issue, that his terror is not causeless, but
that divine vengeance is waiting for him ([Jer
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#006).md); he and his family shall go into
captivity, even to Babylon; he shall neither die before the evil comes,
as Josiah, nor live to survive it, as some did, but he shall die a
captive, and shall in effect be buried in his chains, he and all his
friends. Thus far is the doom of Pashur. Let persecutors read it, and
tremble; tremble to repentance before they be made to tremble to their
ruin.

2\. Did he aim to keep the people easy, to prevent the destruction that
Jeremiah prophesied of, and by sinking his reputation to make his words
fall to the ground? It is probable that he did; for it appears by [Jer
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#006.md) that he did himself set up for a
prophet, and told the people that they should have peace. He prophesied
lies to them; and because Jeremiah's prophecy contradicted his, and
tended to awaken those whom he endeavoured to rock asleep in their sins,
therefore he set himself against him. But could he gain his point? No;
Jeremiah stands to what he has said against Judah and Jerusalem, and God
by his mouth repeats it. Men get nothing by silencing those who reprove
and warn them, for the word will have its course; so it had here. (1.)
The country shall be ruined ([Jer
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#004).md): I will give all Judah into the
hand of the king of Babylon. It had long been God's own land, but he
will now transfer his title to it to Nebuchadnezzar, he shall be master
of the country and dispose of the inhabitants some to the sword and some
to captivity, as he pleases, but none shall escape him. (2.) The city
shall be ruined too, [Jer 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#005.md). The
king of Babylon shall spoil that, and carry all that is valuable in it
to Babylon. \[1.\] He shall seize their magazines and military stores
(here called the strength of this city) and turn them against them.
These they trusted to as their strength; but what stead could they stand
them in when they had thrown themselves out of God's protection, and
when he who was indeed their strength had departed from them? \[2.\] He
shall carry off all their stock in trade, their wares and merchandises,
here called their labours, because it was what they laboured about and
got by their labour. \[3.\] He shall plunder their fine houses, and take
away their rich furniture, here called their precious things, because
they valued them and set their hearts so much upon them. Happy are those
who have secured to themselves precious things in God's precious
promises, which are out of the reach of soldiers. \[4.\] He shall rifle
the exchequer, and take away the jewels of the crown and all the
treasures of the kings of Judah. This was that instance of the calamity
which was first of all threatened to Hezekiah long ago as his punishment
for showing his treasures to the king of Babylon's ambassadors, [Isa
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#006.md). The treasury, they thought, was
their defence; but that betrayed them, and became an easy prey to the
enemy.

[Jeremiah 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 20:7</span></span>

Pashur's doom was to be a terror to himself; Jeremiah, even now, in this
hour of temptation, is far from being so; and yet it cannot be denied
but that he is here, through the infirmity of the flesh, strangely
agitated within himself. Good men are but men at the best. God is not
extreme to mark what they say and do amiss, and therefore we must not be
so, but make the best of it. In these verses it appears that, upon
occasion of the great indignation and injury that Pashur did to
Jeremiah, there was a struggle in his breast between his graces and his
corruptions. His discourse with himself and with his God, upon this
occasion, was somewhat perplexed; let us try to methodize it.

I. Here is a sad representation of the wrong that was done him and the
affronts that were put upon him; and this representation, no doubt, was
according to truth, and deserves no blame, but was very justly and very
fitly made to him that sent him, and no doubt would bear him out. He
complains,

1\. That he was ridiculed and laughed at; they made a jest of every
thing he said and did; and this cannot but be a great grievance to an
ingenuous mind ([Jer 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007.md), [Jer
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#008).md): I am in derision; I am mocked.
They played upon him, and made themselves and one another merry with
him, as if he had been a fool, good for nothing but to make sport. Thus
he was continually: I was in derision daily. Thus he was universally:
Every one mocks me; the greatest so far forget their own gravity, and
the meanest so far forget mine. Thus our Lord Jesus, on the cross, was
reviled both by priests and people; and the revilings of each had their
peculiar aggravation. And what was it that thus exposed him to contempt
and scorn? It was nothing but his faithful and zealous discharge of the
duty of his office, [Jer 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#008.md). They
could find nothing for which to deride him but his preaching; it was the
word of the Lord that was made a reproach. That for which they should
have honoured and respected him - that he was entrusted to deliver the
word of the Lord to them was the very thing for which they reproached
and reviled him. He never preached a sermon, but, though he kept as
closely as possible to his instructions, they found something or other
in it for which to banter and abuse him. Note, It is sad to think that,
though divine revelation be one of the greatest blessings and honours
that ever was bestowed upon the world, yet it has been turned very much
to the reproach of the most zealous preachers and believers of it. Two
things they derided him for: - (1.) The manner of his preaching: Since
he spoke, he cried out. He had always been a lively affectionate
preacher, and since he began to speak in God's name he always spoke as a
man in earnest; he cried aloud and did not spare, spared neither himself
nor those to whom he preached; and this was enough for those to laugh at
who hated to be serious. It is common for those that are unaffected with
and disaffected to, the things of God themselves, to ridicule those that
are much affected with them. Lively preachers are the scorn of careless
unbelieving hearers. (2.) The matter of his preaching: He cried violence
and spoil. He reproved them for the violence and spoil which they were
guilty of towards one another; and he prophesied of the violence and
spoil which should be brought upon them as the punishment of that sin;
for the former they ridiculed him as over-precise, for the latter as
over-credulous; in both he was provoking to them, and therefore they
resolved to run him down. This was bad enough, yet he complains further.

2\. That he was plotted against and his ruin contrived; he was not only
ridiculed as a weak man, but reproached and misrepresented as a bad man
and dangerous to the government. This he laments as his grievance, [Jer
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#010.md). Being laughed at, though it
touches a man in point of honour, is yet a thing that may be easily
laughed at again; for, as it has been well observed, it is no shame to
be laughed at, but to deserve to be so. But there were those that acted
a more spiteful part, and with more subtlety. (1.) They spoke ill of him
behind his back, when he had no opportunity of clearing himself, and
were industrious to spread false reports concerning him: I heard, at
second hand, the defaming of many, fear on every side (of many
Magor-missabibs, so some read it), of many such men as Pashur was, and
who may therefore expect his doom. Or this was the matter of their
defamation; they represented Jeremiah as a man that instilled fears and
jealousies on every side into the minds of the people, and so made them
uneasy under the government, and disposed them to a rebellion. Or he
perceived them to be so malicious against him that he could not but be
afraid on every side; wherever he was he had reason to fear informers;
so that they made him almost a Magor-missabib. These words are found in
the original, verbatim, the same, [Psa
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#013.md), I have heard the slander or
defaming of many, fear on every side. Jeremiah, in his complaint,
chooses to make use of the same words that David had made use of before
him, that it might be a comfort to him to think that other good men had
suffered similar abuses before him, and to teach us to make use of
David's psalms with application to ourselves, as there is occasion.
Whatever we have to say, we may thence take with us words. See how
Jeremiah's enemies contrived the matter: Report, say they, and we will
report it. They resolve to cast an odium upon him, and this is the
method they take: "Let some very bad thing be said of him, which may
render him obnoxious to the government, and, though it be ever so false,
we will second it, and spread it, and add to it." (For the reproaches of
good men lose nothing by the carriage.) "Do you that frame a story
plausibly, or you that can pretend to some acquaintance with him, report
it once, and we will all report it from you, in all companies, that we
come into. Do you say it, and we will swear it; do you set it a going,
and we will follow it." And thus both are equally guilty, those that
raise and those that propagate the false report. The receiver is as bad
as the thief. (2.) They flattered him to his face, that they might get
something from him on which to ground an accusation, as the spies that
came to Christ feigning themselves to be just men, [Luk
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#020.md); [Luk
11:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#053.md), [Luk
11:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#054.md). His familiars, that he
conversed freely with and put a confidence in, watched for his halting,
observed what he said, which they could by any strained innuendo put a
bad construction upon, and carried it to his enemies. His case was very
sad when those betrayed him whom he took to be his friends. They said
among themselves, "If we accost him kindly, and insinuate ourselves into
his acquaintance, per-adventure he will be enticed to own that he is in
confederacy with the enemy and a pensioner to the king of Babylon, or we
shall wheedle him to speak some treasonable words; and then we shall
prevail against him, and take our revenge upon him for telling us of our
faults and threatening us with the judgments of God." Note, Neither the
innocence of the dove, no, nor the prudence of the serpent to help it,
can secure men from unjust censure and false accusation.

II\. Here is an account of the temptation he was in under this
affliction; his feet were almost gone, as the psalmist's, [Psa
73:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#002.md). And this is that which is most
to be dreaded in affliction, being driven by it to sin, [Neh
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#013.md). 1. He was tempted to quarrel
with God for making him a prophet. This he begins with ([Jer
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007).md): O Lord! thou hast deceived me,
and I was deceived. This as we read it, sounds very harshly. God's
servants have been always ready to own that he is a faithful Master and
never cheated them; and therefore this is the language of Jeremiah's
folly and corruption. If, when God called him to be a prophet and told
him he would set him over the kingdoms ([Jer
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010).md) and make him a defenced city, he
flattered himself with an expectation of having universal respect paid
to him as a messenger from heaven, and living safe and easy, and
afterwards it proved otherwise, he must not say that God had deceived
him, but that he had deceived himself; for he knew how the prophets
before him had been persecuted, and had no reason to expect better
treatment. Nay, God had expressly told him that all the princes,
priests, and people of the land would fight against him ([Jer
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#018.md), [Jer
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#019).md), which he had forgotten, else he
would not have laid the blame on God thus. Christ thus told his
disciples what opposition they should meet with, that they might not be
offended, [Joh 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#001.md), [Joh
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#002.md). But the words may very well be
read thus: Thou hast persuaded me, and I was persuaded; it is the same
word that was used, [Gen 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#027.md), margin,
God shall persuade Japhet. And [Pro
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#015.md), By much forbearance is a prince
persuaded. And [Hos 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#014.md), I will
allure her. And this agrees best with what follows: "Thou wast stronger
than I, didst over-persuade me with argument; nay, didst overpower me,
by the influence of thy Spirit upon me, and thou hast prevailed."
Jeremiah was very backward to undertake the prophetic office; he pleaded
that he was under age and unfit for the service; but God over-ruled his
pleas, and told him that he must go, [Jer
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#006.md), [Jer
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#007.md). "Now, Lord," says he, "since thou
hast put this office upon me, why dost thou not stand by me in it? Had I
thrust myself upon it, I might justly have been in derision; but why am
I so when thou didst thrust me into it?" It was Jeremiah's infirmity to
complain thus of God as putting a hardship upon him in calling him to be
a prophet, which he would not have done had he considered the lasting
honour thereby done him, sufficient to counterbalance the present
contempt he was under. Note, As long as we see ourselves in the way of
God and duty it is weakness and folly, when we meet with difficulties
and discouragements in it, to wish we had never set out in it. 2. He was
tempted to quit his work and give it over, partly because he himself met
with so much hardship in it and partly because those to whom he was
sent, instead of being edified and made better, were exasperated and
made worse ([Jer 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#009).md): "Then I said,
Since by prophesying in the name of the Lord I gain nothing to him or
myself but dishonour and disgrace, I will not make mention of him as my
author for any thing I say, nor speak any more in his name; since my
enemies do all they can to silence me, I will even silence myself, and
speak no more, for I may as well speak to the stones as to them." Note,
It is a strong temptation to poor ministers to resolve that they will
preach no more when they see their preaching slighted and wholly
ineffectual. But let people dread putting their ministers into this
temptation. Let not their labour be in vain with us, lest we provoke
them to say that they will take no more pains with us, and provoke God
to say, They shall take no more. Yet let not ministers hearken to this
temptation, but go on in their duty, notwithstanding their
discouragements, for this is the more thankworthy; and, though Israel be
not gathered, yet they shall be glorious.

III\. Here is an account of his faithful adherence to his work and
cheerful dependence on his God notwithstanding.

1\. He found the grace of God mighty in him to keep him to this
business, notwithstanding the temptation he was in to throw it up: "I
said, in my haste, I will speak no more in his name; what I have in my
heart to deliver I will stifle and suppress. But I soon found it was in
my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, which glowed inwardly,
and must have vent; it was impossible to smother it; I was like a man in
a burning fever, uneasy and in a continual agitation; while I kept
silence from good my heart was hot within me, it was pain and grief to
me, and I must speak, that I might be refreshed;" [Psa
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#002.md), [Psa
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003.md); [Job
32:20](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#020.md). While I kept silence, my bones
waxed old, [Psa 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#003.md). See the power of
the spirit of prophecy in those that were actuated by it; and thus will
a holy zeal for God even eat men up, and make them forget themselves. I
believed, therefore have I spoken. Jeremiah was soon weary with
forbearing to preach, and could not contain himself; nothing puts
faithful ministers to pain so much as being silenced, nor to terror so
much as silencing themselves. Their convictions will soon triumph over
temptations of that kind; for woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel,
whatever it cost me, [Co1 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#016.md). And it
is really a mercy to have the word of God thus mighty in us to overpower
our corruptions.

2\. He was assured of God's presence with him, which would be sufficient
to baffle all the attempts of his enemies against him ([Jer
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#011).md): "They say, We shall prevail
against him; the day will undoubtedly be our own. But I am sure that
they shall not prevail, they shall not prosper. I can safely set them
all at defiance, for the Lord is with me, is on my side, to take my part
against them ([Rom 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#031).md), to protect
me from all their malicious designs upon me. He is with me to support me
and bear me up under the burden which now presses me down. He is with me
to make the word I preach answer the end he designs, though not the end
I desire. He is with me as a mighty terrible one, to strike a terror
upon them, and so to overcome them." Note, Even that in God which is
terrible is really comfortable to his servants that trust in him, for it
shall be turned against those that seek to terrify his people. God's
being a mighty God bespeaks him a terrible God to all those that take up
arms against him or any one that, like Jeremiah, was commissioned by
him. How terrible will the wrath of God be to those that think to daunt
all about them and will themselves be daunted by nothing! The most
formidable enemies that act against us appear despicable when we see the
Lord for us as a mighty terrible one, [Neh
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#014.md). Jeremiah speaks now with a good
assurance: "If the Lord be with me, my persecutors shall stumble, so
that, when they pursue me, they shall not overtake me ([Psa
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#002).md), and then they shall be greatly
ashamed of their impotent malice and fruitless attempts. Nay, their
everlasting confusion and infamy shall never be forgotten; they shall
not forget it themselves, but it shall be to them a constant and lasting
vexation, whenever they think of it; others shall not forget it, but it
shall leave upon them an indelible reproach."

3\. He appeals to God against them as a righteous Judge, and prays
judgment upon his cause, [Jer 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#012.md).
He looks upon God as the God that tries the righteous, takes cognizance
of them, and of every cause that they are interested in. He does not
judge in favour of them with partiality, but tries them, and finding
that they have right on their side, and that their persecutors wrong
them and are injurious to them, he gives sentence for them. He that
tries the righteous tries the unrighteous too, and he is very well
qualified to do both; for he sees the reins and the heart, he certainly
knows men's thoughts and affections, their aims and intentions, and
therefore can pass an unerring judgment on their words and actions. Now
this is the God, (1.) To whom the prophet here refers himself, and in
whose court he lodges his appeal: Unto thee have I opened my cause. Not
but that God perfectly knew his cause, and all the merits of it, without
his opening; but the cause we commit to God we must spread before him.
He knows it, but he will know it from us, and allows us to be particular
in the opening of it, not to affect him, but to affect ourselves. Note,
It will be an ease to our spirits, when we are oppressed and burdened,
to open our cause to God and pour out our complaints before him. (2.) By
whom he expects to be righted; "Let me see thy vengeance on them, such
vengeance as thou thinkest fit to take for their conviction and my
vindication, the vengeance thou usest to take on persecutors." Note,
Whatever injuries are done us, we must not study to avenge ourselves,
but must leave it to that God to do it to whom vengeance belongs, and
who hath said, I will repay.

4\. He greatly rejoices and praises God, in a full confidence that God
would appear for his deliverance, [Jer
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#013.md). So full is he of the comfort of
God's presence with him, the divine protection he is under, and the
divine promise he has to depend upon, that in a transport of joy he
stirs up himself and others to give God the glory of it: Sing unto the
Lord, praise you the Lord. Here appears a great change with him since he
began this discourse; the clouds are blown over, his complaints all
silenced and turned into thanksgivings. He has now an entire confidence
in that God whom ([Jer 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007).md) he was
distrusting; he stirs up himself to praise that name which ([Jer
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#009).md) he was resolving no more to make
mention of. It was the lively exercise of faith that made this happy
change, that turned his sighs into songs and his tremblings into
triumphs. It is proper to express our hope in God by our praising him,
and our praising God by our singing to him. That which is the matter of
the praise is, He hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of
the evil-doers; he means especially himself, his own poor soul. "He hath
delivered me formerly when I was in distress, and now of late out of the
hand of Pashur, and he will continue to deliver me, [Co2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#010.md). He will deliver my soul from the
sin that I am in danger of falling into when I am thus persecuted. He
hath delivered me from the hand of evil-doers, so that they have not
gained their point, nor had their will." Note, Those that are faithful
in well-doing need not fear those that are spiteful in evil-doing, for
they have a God to trust to who has well-doers under the hand of his
protection and evil-doers under the hand of his restraint.

[Jeremiah 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 20:14</span></span>

What is the meaning of this? Does there proceed out of the same mouth
blessing and cursing? Could he that said so cheerfully ([Jer
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#013).md), Sing unto the Lord, praise you
the Lord, say so passionately ([Jer
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014).md), Cursed be the day wherein I
was born? How shall we reconcile these? What we have in these verses the
prophet records, I suppose, to his own shame, as he had recorded that in
the foregoing verses to God's glory. It seems to be a relation of the
ferment he had been in while he was in the stocks, out of which by faith
and hope he had recovered himself, rather than a new temptation which he
afterwards fell into, and it should come in like that of David ([Psa
31:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#022).md), I said in my haste, I am cut
off; this is also implied, [Psa 77:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#007.md).
When grace has got the victory it is good to remember the struggles of
corruption, that we may be ashamed of ourselves and our own folly, may
admire the goodness of God in not taking us at our word, and may be
warned by it to double our guard upon our spirits another time. See here
how strong the temptation was which the prophet, by divine assistance,
got the victory over, and how far he yielded to it, that we may not
despair if we through the weakness of the flesh be at any time thus
tempted. Let us see here,

I. What the prophet's language was in this temptation. 1. He fastened a
brand of infamy upon his birthday, as Job did in a heat ([Job
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#001).md): "Cursed be the day wherein I was
born. It was an ill day to me ([Jer
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014).md), because it was the beginning
of sorrows, and an inlet to all this misery." It is a wish that he had
never been born. Judas in hell has reason to wish so ([Mat
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#024).md), but no man on earth has reason
to wish so, because he knows not but he may yet become a vessel of
mercy, much less has any good man reason to wish so. Whereas some keep
their birthday, at the return of the year with gladness, he will look
upon his birthday as a melancholy day, and will solemnize it with
sorrow, and will have it looked upon as an ominous day. 2. He wished ill
to the messenger that brought his father the news of his birth, [Jer
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#015.md). It made his father very glad to
hear that he had a child born (perhaps it was his first-born),
especially that it was a man-child, for then, being of the family of the
priests, he might live to have the honour of serving God's altar; and
yet he is ready to curse the man that brought him the tidings, when
perhaps the father to whom they were brought gave him a gratuity for it.
Here Mr. Gataker well observes, "That parents are often much rejoiced at
the birth of their children when, if they did but foresee what misery
they are born to, they would rather lament over them than rejoice in
them." He is very free and very fierce in the curses he pronounces upon
the messenger of his birth ([Jer
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#016).md): "Let him be at the cities of
Sodom and Gomorrah, which the Lord utterly overthrew, and repented not,
did not in the least mitigate of alleviate their misery. Let him hear
the cry of the invading besieging enemy in the morning, as soon as he is
stirring; then let him take the alarm, and by noon let him hear their
shouting for victory. And thus let him live in constant terror." 3. He
is angry that the fate of the Hebrews' children in Egypt was not his,
that he was not slain from the womb, that his first breath was not his
last, and that he was not strangled as soon as he came into the world,
[Jer 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#017.md). He wishes the messenger of
his birth had been better employed and had been his murderer; nay, that
his mother of whom he was born had been, to her great misery, always
with child of him, and so the womb in which he was conceived would have
served, without more ado, as a grave for him to be buried in. Job
intimates a near alliance and resemblance between the womb and the
grave, [Job 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#021.md). Naked came I out of
my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither. 4. He thinks his
present calamities sufficient to justify these passionate wishes ([Jer
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#018).md): "Wherefore came I forth out of
the womb, where I lay hid, was not seen, was not hated, where I lay
safely and knew no evil, to see all this labour and sorrow, nay to have
my days consumed with shame, to be continually vexed and abused, to have
my life not only spent in trouble, but wasted and worn away by trouble?"

II\. What use we may make of this. It is not recorded for our imitation,
and yet we may learn good lessons from it. 1. See the vanity of human
life and the vexation of spirit that attends it. If there were not
another life after this, we should be tempted many a time to wish that
we have never known this; for our few days here are full of trouble. 2.
See the folly and absurdity of sinful passion, how unreasonably it talks
when it is suffered to ramble. What nonsense is it to curse a day - to
curse a messenger for the sake of his message! What a brutish barbarous
thing for a child to wish his own mother had never been delivered of
him! See [Isa 45:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#010.md). We can easily see
the folly of it in others, and should take warning thence to suppress
all such intemperate heats and passions in ourselves, to stifle them at
first and not to suffer these evil spirits to speak. When the heart is
hot, let the tongue be bridled, [Psa
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001.md), [Psa
39:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#002.md). 3. See the weakness even of good
men, who are but men at the best. See how much those who think they
stand are concerned to take heed lest they fall, and to pray daily,
Father in heaven, lead us not into temptation!
