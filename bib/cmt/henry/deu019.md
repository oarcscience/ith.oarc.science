### [Deuteronomy Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 19:0</span></span>

The laws which Moses had hitherto been repeating and urging mostly
concerned the acts of religion and devotion towards God; but here he
comes more fully to press the duties of righteousness between man and
man. This chapter relates, I. To the sixth commandment, "Thou shalt not
kill" ([Deu 19:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#001).md). II. To the
eighth commandment, "Thou shalt not steal" ([Deu
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#014).md). III. To the ninth commandment,
"Thou shalt not bear false witness," ([Deu
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015), etc..md).

[Deuteronomy 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 19:1</span></span>

It was one of the precepts given to the sons of Noah that whoso sheddeth
man's blood by man shall his blood be shed, that is, by the avenger of
blood, [Gen 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006.md). Now here we have the
law settled between blood and blood, between the blood of the murdered
and the blood of the murderer, and effectual provision made,

I. That the cities of refuge should be a protection to him that slew
another casually, so that he should not die for that as a crime which
was not his voluntary act, but only his unhappiness. The appointment of
these cities of refuge we had before ([Exo
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#013).md), and the law laid down
concerning them at large, [Num 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#010.md),
etc. It is here repeated, and direction is given concerning three
things: -

1\. The appointing of three cities in Canaan for this purpose. Moses had
already appointed three on that side Jordan which he saw the conquest
of; and now he bids them, when they should be settled in the other part
of the country, to appoint three more, [Deu
19:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#001.md), [Deu
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#007.md). The country was to be divided
into three districts, as near by as might be equal, and a city of refuge
in the centre of each so that every corner of the land might have one
within reach. Thus Christ is not a refuge at a distance, which we must
ascend to heaven or go down to the deep for, but the word is nigh us,
and Christ in the word, [Rom 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#008.md). The
gospel brings salvation to our door, and there it knocks for admission.
To make the flight of the delinquent the more easy, the way must be
prepared that led to the city of refuge. Probably they had causeways or
street-ways leading to those cities, and the Jews say that the
magistrates of Israel, upon one certain day in the year, sent out
messengers to see that those roads were in good repair, and they were to
remove stumbling-blocks, mend bridges that were broken, and, where two
ways met, they were to set up a Mercurial post, with a finger to point
the right way, on which was engraven in great letters, Miklat, Miklat -
Refuge, Refuge. In allusion to this, gospel ministers are to show people
the way to Christ, and to assist and direct them in flying by faith to
him for refuge. They must be ready to remove their prejudices, and help
them over their difficulties. And, blessed be God, the way of holiness,
to all that seek it faithfully, is a highway so plain that the wayfaring
men, though fools, shall not err therein.

2\. The use to be made of these cities, [Deu
19:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#004). (1..md) It is supposed that it
might so happen that a man might be the death of his neighbour without
any design upon him either from a sudden passion or malice prepense, but
purely by accident, as by the flying off of an axe-head, which is the
instance here given, with which every case of this kind was to be
compared, and by it adjudged. See how human life lies exposed daily, and
what deaths we are often in, and what need therefore we have to be
always ready, our souls being continually in our hands. How are the sons
of men snared in an evil time, when it falls suddenly upon them! [Ecc
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#012.md). An evil time indeed it is when
this happens not only to the slain but to the slayer. (2.) It is
supposed that the relations of the person slain would be forward to
avenge the blood, in affection to their friend and in zeal for public
justice. Though the law did not allow the avenging of any other affront
or injury with death, yet the avenger of blood, the blood of a relation,
shall have great allowances made for the heat of his heart upon such a
provocation as that, and his killing only, should not be accounted
murder if he did it before he got to the city of refuge, though it is
owned he was not worthy of death. Thus would God possess people with a
great horror and dread of the sin of murder: if mere chance-medley did
thus expose a man, surely he that wilfully does violence to the blood of
any person, whether from an old grudge or upon a sudden provocation,
must flee to the pit, and let no man stay him ([Pro
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#017).md); yet the New Testament
represents the sin of murder as more heinous and more dangerous than
even this law does. [Jo1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#015.md), You
know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. (3.) It is
provided that, if an avenger of blood should be so unreasonable as to
demand satisfaction for blood shed by accident only, then the city of
refuge should protect the slayer. Sins of ignorance indeed do expose us
to the wrath of God, but there is relief provided, if by faith and
repentance we make use of it. Paul that had been a persecutor obtained
mercy, because he did it ignorantly; and Christ prayed for his
crucifiers, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.

3\. The appointing of three cities more for this use in case God should
hereafter enlarge their territories and the dominion of their religion,
that all those places which came under the government of the law of
Moses in other instances might enjoy the benefit of that law in this
instance, [Deu 19:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#008). Here is, (1..md)
An intimation of God's gracious intention to enlarge their coast, as he
had promised to their fathers, if they did not by their disobedience
forfeit the promise, the condition of which is here carefully repeated,
that, if it were not performed, the reproach might lie upon them, and
not on God. He promised to give it, if thou shalt keep all these
commandments; not otherwise. (2.) A direction to them to appoint three
cities more in their new conquests, which, the number intimates, should
be as large as their first conquests were; wherever the border of Israel
went this privilege must attend it, that innocent blood be not shed,
[Deu 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#010.md). Though God is the saviour
and preserver of all men, and has a tender regard to all lives, yet the
blood of Israelites is in a particular manner precious to him, [Psa
72:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#014.md). The learned Ainsworth observes
that the Jewish writers themselves own that, the condition not being
performed, the promise of the enlarging of their coast was never
fulfilled; so that there was no occasion for ever adding these three
cities of refuge; yet the holy blessed God (say they) did not command it
in vain, for in the days of Messiah the prince three other cities shall
be added to these six: they expect it to be fulfilled in the letter, but
we know that in Christ it has its spiritual accomplishment, for the
borders of the gospel Israel are enlarged according to the promise, and
in Christ, the Lord our righteousness, refuge is provided for those that
by faith flee to him.

II\. It is provided that the cities of refuge should be no sanctuary or
shelter to a wilful murderer, but even thence he should be fetched, and
delivered to the avenger of blood, [Deu
19:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#011.md). 1. This shows that wilful
murder must never be protected by the civil magistrate; he bears the
sword of justice in vain if he suffers those to escape the edge of it
that lie under the guilt of blood, which he by office is the avenger of.
During the dominion of the papacy in our own land, before the
Reformation, there were some churches and religious houses (as they
called them) that were made sanctuaries for the protection of all sorts
of criminals that fled to them, wilful murderers not excepted, so that
(as Stamford says, in his Pleas of the Crown, lib. II. c. 38) the
government follows not Moses but Romulus, and it was not till about the
latter end of Henry VIII's time that this privilege of sanctuary for
wilful murder was taken away, when in that, as in other cases, the word
of God came to be regarded more than the dictates of the see of Rome.
And some have thought it would be a completing of that instance of
reformation if the benefit of clergy were taken away for man-slaughter,
that is, the killing of a man upon a small provocation, since this law
allowed refuge only in case of that which our law calls chance-medley.
2. It may be alluded to to show that in Jesus Christ there is no refuge
for presumptuous sinners, that go on still in their trespasses. If we
thus sin wilfully, sin and go on in it, there remains no sacrifice, [Heb
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026.md). Those that flee to Christ from
their sins shall be safe in him, but not those that expect to be
sheltered by him in their sins. Salvation itself cannot save such:
divine justice will fetch them even from the city of refuge, the
protection of which they are not entitled to.

[Deuteronomy 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 19:14</span></span>

Here is a statute for the preventing of frauds and perjuries; for the
divine law takes care of men's rights and properties, and has made a
hedge about them. Such a friend is it to human society and men's civil
interest.

I. A law against frauds, [Deu 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#014.md).
1. Here is an implicit direction given to the first planters of Canaan
to fix land-marks, according to the distribution of the land to the
several tribes and families by lot. Note, It is the will of God that
every one should know his own, and that all good means should be used to
prevent encroachments and the doing and suffering of wrong. When right
is settled, care must be taken that it be not afterwards unsettled, and
that, if possible, no occasion of dispute may arise. 2. An express law
to posterity not to remove those land-marks which were thus fixed at
first, by which a man secretly got that to himself which was his
neighbour's. This, without doubt, is a moral precept, and still binding,
and to us it forbids, (1.) The invading of any man's right, and taking
to ourselves that which is not our own, by any fraudulent arts or
practices, as by forging, concealing, destroying, or altering deeds and
writings (which are our land-marks, to which appeals are made), or by
shifting hedges, meer-stones, and boundaries. Though the land-marks were
set by the hand of man, yet he was a thief and a robber by the law of
God that removed them. Let every man be content with his own lot, and
just to his neighbours, and then we shall have no land-marks removed.
(2.) It forbids the sowing of discord among neighbours, and doing any
thing to occasion strife and law-suits, which is done (and it is very
ill done) by confounding those things which should determine disputes
and decide controversies. And, (3.) It forbids breaking in upon the
settled order and constitution of civil government, and the altering of
ancient usages without just cause. This law supports the honour of
prescriptions. Consuetudo facit jus - Custom is to be held as law.

II\. A law against perjuries, which enacts two things: - 1. That a
single witness should never be admitted to give evidence in a criminal
cause, so as that sentence should be passed upon his testimony, [Deu
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015.md). This law we had before, [Num
35:30](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#030.md), and in this book, [Deu
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#006.md). This was enacted in favour to
the prisoner, whose life and honour should not lie at the mercy of a
particular person that had a pique against him, and for caution to the
accuser not to say that which he could not corroborate by the testimony
of another. It is a just shame which this law puts upon mankind as false
and not to be trusted; every man is by it suspected: and it is the
honour of God's grace that the record he has given concerning his Son is
confirmed both in heaven and in earth by three witnesses, [Jo1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#007.md). Let God be true and every man a
liar, [Rom 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004.md). 2. That a false
witness should incur the same punishment which was to have been
inflicted upon the person he accused. If two, or three, or many
witnesses, concurred in a false testimony, they were all liable to be
prosecuted upon this law. (2.) The person wronged or brought into peril
by the false testimony is supposed to be the appellant, [Deu
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#017.md). And yet if the person were put
to death upon the evidence, and afterwards it appeared to be false, any
other person, or the judges themselves, ex officio - by virtue of their
office, might call the false witness to account. (3.) Causes of this
kind, having more than ordinary difficulty in them, were to be brought
before the supreme court, The priests and judges, who are said to be
before the Lord, because, as other judges sat in the gates of their
cities, so these at the gate of the sanctuary, [Deu
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#012). (4..md) There must be great care
in the trial, [Deu 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#018.md). A diligent
inquisition must be made into the characters of the persons, and all the
circumstances of the case, which must be compared, that the truth might
be found out, which, where it is thus faithfully and impartially
enquired into, Providence, it may be hoped, will particularly advance
the discovery of. (5.) If it appeared that a man had knowingly and
maliciously borne false witness against his neighbour, though the
mischief he designed him thereby was not effected, he must undergo the
same penalty which his evidence would have brought his neighbour under,
[Deu 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#019.md). Nec lex est justior ulla -
Nor could any law be more just. If the crime he accused his neighbour of
was to be punished with death, the false witness must be put to death;
if with stripes, he must be beaten; if with a pecuniary mulct, he was to
be fined the sum. And because to those who considered not the
heinousness of the crime, and the necessity of making this provision
against it, it might seem hard to punish a man so severely for a few
words' speaking, especially when no mischief did actually follow, it is
added: Thy eye shall not pity, [Deu
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#021.md). No man needs to be more
merciful than God. The benefit that will accrue to the public from this
severity will abundantly recompense it: Those that remain shall hear and
fear, [Deu 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#020.md). Such exemplary
punishments will be warnings to others not to attempt any such mischief,
when they see how he that made the pit and digged it has fallen into the
ditch which he made.
