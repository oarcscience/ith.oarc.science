### [Deuteronomy Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 16:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have, I. A repetition of the laws concerning the
three yearly feasts; in particular, that of the passover ([Deu
16:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#001).md). That of pentecost ([Deu
16:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#009).md). That of tabernacles ([Deu
16:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#013).md). And the general law
concerning the people's attendance on them ([Deu
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#016.md), [Deu
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#017).md). II. The institution of an
inferior magistracy, and general rules of justice given to those that
were called into office ([Deu
16:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#018).md). III. A caveat against
groves and images ([Deu 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#021.md), [Deu
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#022).md).

[Deuteronomy 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 16:1</span></span>

Much of the communion between God and his people Israel was kept up, and
a face of religion preserved in the nation, by the three yearly feasts,
the institution of which, and the laws concerning them, we have several
times met with already; and here they are repeated.

I. The law of the passover, so great a solemnity that it made the whole
month, in the midst of which it was placed, considerable: Observe the
month Abib, [Deu 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#001.md). Though one week
only of this month was to be kept as a festival, yet their preparations
before must be so solemn, and their reflections upon it and improvements
of it afterwards so serious, as to amount to an observance of the whole
month. The month of Abib, or of new fruits, as the Chaldee translates
it, answers to our March (or part of March and part of April), and was
by a special order from God, in remembrance of the deliverance of Israel
out of Egypt, made the beginning of their year ([Exo
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#002).md), which before was reckoned to
begin in September. This month they were to keep the passover, in
remembrance of their being brought out of Egypt by night, [Deu
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#001.md). The Chaldee paraphrasts expound
it, "Because they came out of Egypt by daylight," there being an express
order that they should not stir out of their doors till morning, [Exo
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#022.md). One of them expounds it thus:
"He brought thee out of Egypt, and did wonders by night." The other,
"and thou shalt eat the passover by night." The laws concerning it are,
1. That they must be sure to sacrifice the passover in the place that
God should choose ([Deu 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#002).md), and in
no other place, [Deu 16:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#005.md). The
passover was itself a sacrifice; hence Christ, as our passover, is said
to be sacrificed for us ([Co1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007).md),
and many other sacrifices were offered during the seven days of the
feast ([Num 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#019), etc..md), which are
included here, for they are said to be sacrificed of the flock and the
herd, whereas the passover itself was only of the flock, either a lamb
or a kid: now no sacrifice was accepted but from the altar that
sanctified it; it was therefore necessary that they should to up to the
place of the altar, for, though the paschal lamb was entirely eaten by
the owners, yet it must be killed in the court, the blood sprinkled, and
the inwards burned upon the altar. By confining them to the appointed
rule, from which they would have been apt to vary, and to introduce
foolish inventions of their own, had they been permitted to offer these
sacrifices within their own gates, from under the inspection of the
priests. They were also hereby directed to have their eye up unto God in
the solemnity, and the desire of their hearts towards the remembrance of
his name, being appointed to attend where he had chosen to place his
name, [Deu 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#002.md) and [Deu
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#006.md). But, when the solemnity was
over, they might turn and go unto their tents, [Deu
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#007.md). Some think that they might, if
they pleased, return the very morning after the paschal lamb was killed
and eaten, the priests and Levites being sufficient to carry on the rest
of the week's work; but the first day of the seven is so far from being
the day of their dispersion that it is expressly appointed for a holy
convocation ([Lev 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#007.md); [Num
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#018).md); therefore we must take it as
Jonathan's paraphrase expounds it, in the morning after the end of the
feast thou shalt go to thy cities. And it was the practice to keep
together the whole week, [Ch2 35:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#017.md).
2. That they must eat unleavened bread for seven days, and no leavened
bread must be seen in all their coasts, [Deu
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#003.md), [Deu
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#004.md), [Deu
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#008.md). The bread they were confined to
is here called bread of affliction, because neither grateful to the
taste nor easy of digestion, and therefore proper to signify the
heaviness of their spirits in their bondage and to keep in remembrance
the haste in which they came out, the case being so urgent that they
could not stay for the leavening of the bread they took with them for
their march. The Jewish writers tell us that the custom at the passover
supper was that the master of the family broke this unleavened bread,
and gave to every one a piece of it, saying, This is (that is, this
signifies, represents, or commemorates, which explains that saying of
our Saviour, This is my body) the bread of affliction which your fathers
did eat in the land of Egypt. The gospel meaning of this feast of
unleavened bread the apostle gives us, [Co1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007.md). Christ our passover being
sacrificed for us, and we having participated in the blessed fruits of
that sacrifice to our comfort, let us keep the feast in a holy
conversation, free from the leaven of malice towards our brethren and
hypocrisy towards God, and with the unleavened bread of sincerity and
love. Lastly, Observe, concerning the passover, for what end it was
instituted: "That thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth
out of Egypt, not only on the day of the passover, or during the seven
days of the feast, but all the days of thy life ([Deu
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#003).md), as a constant inducement to
obedience." Thus we celebrate the memorial of Christ's death at certain
times, that we may remember it at all times, as a reason why we should
live to him that died for us and rose again.

II\. Seven weeks after the passover the feast of pentecost was to be
observed, concerning which they are here directed, 1. Whence to number
their seven weeks, from the time thou beginnest to put the sickle to the
corn ([Deu 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#009).md), that is, from the
morrow after the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, for on that
day (though it is probable the people did not begin their harvest till
the feast was ended) messengers were sent to reap a sheaf of barley,
which was to be offered to God as the first-fruits, [Lev
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#010.md). Some think it implies a
particular care which Providence would take of their land with respect
to the weather, that their harvest should be always ripe and ready for
the sickle just at the same time. 2. How they were to keep this feast.
(1.) They must bring an offering unto God, [Deu
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#010.md). It is here called a tribute of
a free-will-offering. It was required of them as a tribute to their
Sovereign Lord and owner, under whom they held all they had; and yet
because the law did not determine the quantum, but it was left to every
man's generosity to bring what he chose, and whatever he brought he must
give cheerfully, it is therefore called a free-will offering. It was a
grateful acknowledgment of the goodness of God to them in the mercies of
these corn-harvests now finished, and therefore must be according as God
had blessed them. Where God sows plentifully he expects to reap
accordingly. (2.) They must rejoice before God, [Deu
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#011.md). Holy joy is the heart and soul
of thankful praises, which are as the language and expression of holy
joy. They must rejoice in their receivings from God, and in their
returns of service and sacrifice to him; our duty must be our delight as
well as our enjoyments. They must have their very servants to rejoice
with them, "for remember ([Deu 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#012).md)
that thou wast a bond-man, and wouldest have been very thankful if thy
taskmasters would have given thee some time and cause for rejoicing; and
thy God did bring thee out to keep a feast with gladness; therefore be
pleasant with thy servants, and make them easy." And, it should seem,
those general words, thou shalt observe and do these statutes, are added
here for a particular reason, because this feast was kept in remembrance
of the giving of the law upon Mount Sinai, fifty days after they came
out of Egypt; now the best way of expressing our thankfulness to God for
his favour to us in giving us his law is to observe and do according to
the precepts of it.

III\. They must keep the feast of tabernacles, [Deu
16:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#013.md). Here is no repetition of the
law concerning the sacrifices that were to be offered in great abundance
at this feast (which we had at large, [Num
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#012), etc..md), because the care of
these belonged to the priests and Levites, who had not so much need of a
repetition as the people had, and because the spiritual part of the
service, which consisted in holy joy, was most pleasing to God, and was
to be the perpetual duty of a gospel conversation, of which this feast
was typical. Observe what stress is laid upon it here: Thou shalt
rejoice in thy feast ([Deu 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#014).md),
and, because the Lord shall bless thee, thou shalt surely rejoice, [Deu
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#015.md). Note, 1. It is the will of God
that his people should be a cheerful people. If those that were under
the law must rejoice before God, much more must we that are under the
grace of the gospel, which makes it our duty, not only as here to
rejoice in our feasts, but to rejoice evermore, to rejoice in the Lord
always. 2. When we rejoice in God ourselves we should do what we can to
assist others also to rejoice in him, by comforting the mourners and
supplying the necessitous, that even the stranger, the fatherless, and
the widow may rejoice with us. See [Job
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#013.md). 3. We must rejoice in God, not
only because of what we have received and are receiving from him daily,
but because of what he has promised, and we expect to receive yet
further from him: because he shall bless thee, therefore thou shalt
rejoice. Those that make God their joy may rejoice in hope, for he is
faithful that has promised.

IV\. The laws concerning the three solemn feasts are summed up ([Deu
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#016.md), [Deu
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#017).md), as often before, [Exo
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#016.md), [Exo
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#017.md); [Exo
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#023.md). The general commands concerning
them are, 1. That all the males must then make their personal appearance
before God, that by their frequent meeting to worship God, at the same
place, and by the same rule, they might be kept faithful and constant to
that holy religion which was established among them. 2. That none must
appear before God empty, but every man must bring some offering or
other, in token of a dependence upon God and gratitude to him. And God
was not unreasonable in his demands; let every man but give as he was
able, and no more was expected. The same is still the rule of charity,
[Co1 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#002.md). Those that give to their
power shall be accepted, but those that give beyond their power are
accounted worthy of double honour ([Co2
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#003).md), as the poor widow that gave all
she had, [Luk 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#004.md).

[Deuteronomy 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 16:18</span></span>

Here is, I. Care taken for the due administration of justice among them,
that controversies might be determined, matters in variance adjusted,
the injured redressed, and the injurious punished. While they were
encamped in the wilderness, they had judges and officers according to
their numbers, rulers of thousands and hundreds, [Exo
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#025.md). When they came to Canaan, they
must have them according to their towns and cities, in all their gates;
for the courts of judgment sat in the gates. Now, 1. Here is a
commission given to these inferior magistrates: "Judges to try and pass
sentence, and officers to execute their sentences, shalt thou make
thee." However the persons were pitched upon, whether by the nomination
of their sovereign or by the election of the people, the power were
ordained of God, [Rom 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001.md). And it was
a great mercy to the people thus to have justice brought to their doors,
that it might be more expeditious and less expensive, a blessing which
we of this nation ought to be very thankful for. Pursuant to this law,
besides the great sanhedrim that sat at the sanctuary, consisting of
seventy elders and a president, there was in the larger cities, such as
had in them above 120 families, a court of twenty-three judges, in the
smaller cities a court of three judges. See this law revived by
Jehoshaphat, [Ch2 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#005.md), [Ch2
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#008.md). 2. Here is a command given to
these magistrates to do justice in the execution of the trust reposed in
them. Better not judge at all than not judge with just judgment,
according to the direction of the law and the evidence of the fact. (1.)
The judges are here cautioned not to do wrong to any ([Deu
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#019).md), nor to take any gifts, which
would tempt them to do wrong. This law had been given before, [Exo
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#008). (2..md) They are charged to do
justice to all: "That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, [Deu
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#020.md). Adhere to the principles of
justice, act by the rules of justice, countenance the demands of
justice, imitate the patterns of justice, and pursue with resolution
that which appears to be just. Justice, justice, shalt thou follow."
This is that which the magistrate is to have in his eye, on this he must
be intent, and to this all personal regards must be sacrificed, to do
right to all and wrong to none.

II\. Care taken for the preventing of all conformity to the idolatrous
customs of the heathen, [Deu 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#021.md),
[Deu 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#022.md). They must not only not
join with the idolaters in their worships, not visit their groves, nor
bow before the images which they had set up, but, 1. They must not plant
a grove, nor so much as a tree, near God's altar lest they should make
it look like the altars of the false gods. They made groves the places
of their worship either to make it secret (but that which is true and
good desires the light rather), or to make it solemn, but the worship of
the true God has enough in itself to make it so and needs not the
advantage of such a circumstance. 2. They must not set up any image,
statue, or pillar, to the honour of God, for it is a thing which the
Lord hates; nothing belies or reproaches him more, or tends more to
corrupt and debauch the minds of men, than representing and worshipping
by an image that God who is an infinite and eternal Spirit.
