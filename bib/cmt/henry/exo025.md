### [Exodus Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 25:0</span></span>

At this chapter begins an account of the orders and instructions God
gave to Moses upon the mount for the erecting and furnishing of a
tabernacle to the honour of God. We have here. I. Orders given for a
collection to be made among the people for this purpose ([Exo
25:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#001).md). II. Particular instructions,
1. Concerning the ark of the covenant ([Exo
25:10-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#010).md). 2. The table of showbread
([Exo 25:23-30](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#023).md). 3. The golden
candlestick ([Exo 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031), etc..md).

[Exodus 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 25:1</span></span>

We may suppose that when Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and
abode there so long, where the holy angels attended the shechinah, or
divine Majesty, he saw and heard very glorious things relating to the
upper world, but they were things which it was not lawful nor possible
to utter; and therefore, in the records he kept of the transactions
there, he says nothing to satisfy the curiosity of those who would
intrude into the things which they have not seen, but writes that only
which he was to speak to the children of Israel. For the scripture is
designed to direct us in our duty, not to fill our heads with
speculations, nor to please our fancies.

In these verses God tells Moses his intention in general, that the
children of Israel should build him a sanctuary, for he designed to
dwell among them ([Exo 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#008).md); and some
think that, though there were altars and groves used for religious
worship before this, yet there never was any house, or temple, built for
sacred uses in any nation before this tabernacle was erected by Moses,
and that all the temples which were afterwards so much celebrated among
the heathen took rise from this and pattern by it. God had chosen the
people of Israel to be a peculiar people to himself (above all people),
among whom divine revelation, and a religion according to it, should be
lodged and established: he himself would be their King. As their King,
he had already given them laws for the government of themselves, and
their dealings one with another, with some general rules for religious
worship, according to the light of reason and the law of nature, in the
ten commandments and the following comments upon them. But this was not
thought sufficient to distinguish them from other nations, or to answer
to the extent of that covenant which God would make with them to be
their God; and therefore,

I. He orders a royal palace to be set up among them for himself, here
called a sanctuary, or holy place, or habitation, of which it is said
([Jer 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#012).md), A glorious high throne
from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary. This sanctuary is to
be considered,

1\. As ceremonial, consonant to the to the other institutions of that
dispensation, which consisted in carnal ordinances ([Heb
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010).md); hence it is called a worldly
sanctuary, [Heb 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001.md). God in it kept
his court, as Israel's King. (1.) There he manifested his presence among
them, and it was intended for a sign or token of his presence, that,
while they had that in the midst of them, they might never again ask, Is
the Lord among us or not? And, because in the wilderness they dwelt in
tents, even this royal palace was ordered to be a tabernacle too, that
it might move with them, and might be an instance of the condescension
of the divine favour. (2.) There he ordered his subjects to attend him
with their homage and tribute. Thither they must come to consult his
oracles, thither they must bring their sacrifices, and there all Israel
must meet, to pay their joint respects to the God of Israel.

2\. As typical; the holy places made with hands were the figures of the
true, [Heb 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024.md). The gospel church is
the true tabernacle, which the Lord hath pitched, and not man, [Heb
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#002.md). The body of Christ, in and by
which he made atonement, was the greater and more perfect tabernacle,
[Heb 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011.md). The Word was made flesh,
and dwelt among us, as in a tabernacle.

II\. When Moses was to erect this palace, it was requisite that he
should first be instructed where he must have the materials, and where
he must have the model; for he could neither contrive it by his own
ingenuity nor build it at his own charge; he is therefore directed here
concerning both.

1\. The people must furnish him with the materials, not by a tax imposed
upon them, but by a voluntary contribution. This is the first thing
concerning which orders are here given.

(1.) Speak unto the children of Israel that they bring me an offering;
and there was all the reason in the world that they should, for ([Exo
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#001).md), \[1.\] It was God himself that
had not only enlarged them, but enriched them with the spoils of the
Egyptians. He had instructed them to borrow, and he had inclined the
Egyptians to lend, so that from him they had their wealth, and therefore
it was fit they should devote it to him and use it for him, and thus
make a grateful acknowledgement of the favours they had received. Note,
First, The best use we can make of our worldly wealth is to honour God
with it in works of piety and charity. Secondly, When we have been
blessed with some remarkable success in our affairs, and have had, as we
say, a good turn, it may be justly expected that we should do something
more than ordinary for the glory of God, consecrating our gain, in some
reasonable proportion of it, to the Lord of the whole earth, [Mic
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#013.md). \[2.\] The sanctuary that was to
be built was intended for their benefit and comfort, and therefore they
must be at the expense of it. They had been unworthy of the privilege if
they had grudged at the charge. They might well afford to offer
liberally for the honour of God, while they lived at free quarters,
having food for themselves and their families rained upon them daily
from heaven. We also must own that we have our all from God's bounty,
and therefore ought to use all for his glory. Since we live upon him, we
must live to him.

(2.) This offering must be given willingly, and with the heart, that is,
\[1.\] It was not prescribed to them what or how much they must give,
but it was left to their generosity, that they might show their
good-will to the house of God and the offices thereof, and might do it
with a holy emulation, the zeal of a few provoking many, [Co2
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002.md). We should ask, not only, "What
must we do?" but, "What may we do for God?" \[2.\] Whatever they gave,
they must give it cheerfully, not grudgingly and with reluctance, for
God loves a cheerful giver, [Co2 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007.md).
What is laid out in the service of God we must reckon well bestowed.

(3.) The particulars are here mentioned which they must offer ([Exo
25:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#003).md), all of them things that there
would be occasion for in the tabernacle, or the service of it. Some
observe that here was gold, silver, and brass, provided, but no iron;
that is the military metal, and this was to be a house of peace. Every
thing that was provided was very rich and fine, and the best of the
sort; for God, who is the best, should have the best.

2\. God himself would furnish him with the model: According to all that
I show thee, [Exo 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#009.md). God showed him
an exact plan of it, in miniature, which he must conform to in all
points. Thus Ezekiel saw in vision the form of the house and the fashion
thereof, [Eze 43:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#011.md). Note, Whatsoever
is done in God's service must be done by his direction, and not
otherwise. Yet God did not only show him the model, but gave him also
particular directions how to frame the tabernacle according to that
model, in all the parts of it, which he goes over distinctly in this and
the following chapters. When Moses, in the beginning of Genesis, was to
describe the creation of the world, though it is such a stately and
curious fabric and made up of such a variety and vast number of
particulars, yet he gave a very short and general account of it, and
nothing compared with what the wisdom of this world would have desired
and expected from one that wrote by divine revelation; but, when he
comes to describe the tabernacle, he does it with the greatest niceness
and accuracy imaginable. He that gave us no account of the lines and
circles of the globe, the diameter of the earth, or the height and
magnitude of the stars, has told us particularly the measure of every
board and curtain of the tabernacle; for God's church and instituted
religion are more precious to him and more considerable than all the
rest of the world. And the scriptures were written, not to describe to
us the works of nature, a general view of which is sufficient to lead us
to the knowledge and service of the Creator, but to acquaint us with the
methods of grace, and those things which are purely matters of divine
revelation. The blessedness of the future state is more fully
represented under the notion of a new Jerusalem than under the notion of
new heavens and a new earth.

[Exodus 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 25:10</span></span>

The first thing which is here ordered to be made is the ark with its
appurtenances, the furniture of the most holy place, and the special
token of God's presence, for which the tabernacle was erected to be the
receptacle.

I. The ark itself was a chest, or coffer, in which the two tables of the
law, written with the finger of God, were to be honourably deposited,
and carefully kept. The dimensions of it are exactly ordered; if the
Jewish cubit was, as some learned men compute, three inches longer than
our half-yard (twenty-one inches in all), this chest or cabinet was
about fifty-two inches long, thirty-one broad, and thirty-one deep. It
was overlaid within and without with thin plates of gold. It had a
crown, or cornice, of gold, round it, with rings and staves to carry it
with; and in it he must put the testimony, [Exo
25:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#010.md). The tables of the law are
called the testimony because God did in them testify his will: his
giving them that law was in token of his favour to them; and their
acceptance of it was in token of their subjection and obedience to him.
This law was a testimony to them, to direct them in their duty, and
would be a testimony against them if they transgressed. The ark is
called the ark of the testimony ([Exo
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#006).md), and the tabernacle the
tabernacle of the testimony ([Num
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#011).md) or witness, [Act
7:44](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#044.md). The gospel of Christ is also
called a testimony or witness, [Mat
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#014.md). It is observable, 1. That the
tables of the law were carefully preserved in the ark for the purpose,
to teach us to make much of the word of God, and to hide it in our
hearts, in our innermost thoughts, as the ark was placed in the holy of
holies. It intimates likewise the care which divine Providence ever did,
and ever will, take to preserve the records of divine revelation in the
church, so that even in the latter days there shall be seen in his
temple the ark of his testament. See [Rev
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#019.md). 2. That this ark was the chief
token of God's presence, which teaches us that the first and great
evidence and assurance of God's favour is the putting of his law in the
heart. God dwells where that rules, [Heb
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010.md). 3. That provision was made for
the carrying of this ark about with them in all their removals, which
intimates to us that, wherever we go, we should take our religion along
with us, always bearing about with us the love of the Lord Jesus, and
his law.

II\. The mercy-seat was the covering of the ark or chest, made of solid
gold, exactly to fit the dimensions of the ark, [Exo
25:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#017.md), [Exo
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#021.md). This propitiatory covering, as
it might well be translated, was a type of Christ, the great
propitiation, whose satisfaction fully answers the demands of the law,
covers our transgressions, and comes between us and the curse we
deserve. Thus he is the end of the law for righteousness.

III\. The cherubim of gold were fixed to the mercy-seat, and of a piece
with it, and spread their wings over it, [Exo
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#018.md). It is supposed that these
cherubim were designed to represent the holy angels, who always attended
the shechinah, or divine Majesty, particularly at the giving of the law;
not by any effigies of an angel, but some emblem of the angelical
nature, probably some one of those four faces spoken of, [Eze
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#010.md). Whatever the faces were, they
looked one towards another, and both downward towards the ark, while
their wings were stretched out so as to touch one another. The apostle
calls them cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy-seat, [Heb
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#005.md). It denotes their attendance upon
the Redeemer, to whom they were ministering spirits, their readiness to
do his will, their special presence in the assemblies of saints ([Psa
68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017.md); [Co1
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#010).md), and their desire to look into
the mysteries of the gospel which they diligently contemplate, [Pe1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012.md). God is said to dwell, or sit,
between the cherubim, on the mercy-seat ([Psa
80:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001).md), and thence he here promises,
for the future, to meet with Moses, and to commune with him, [Exo
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022.md). There he would give law, and
there he would give audience, as a prince on his throne; and thus he
manifests himself willing to be reconciled to us, and keep up communion
with us, in and by the mediation of Christ. In allusion to this
mercy-seat, we are said to come boldly to the throne of grace ([Heb
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#016).md); for we are not under the law,
which is covered, but under grace, which is displayed; its wings are
stretched out, and we are invited to come under the shadow of them, [Rut
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#012.md).

[Exodus 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 25:23</span></span>

Here is, 1. A table ordered to be made of wood overlaid with gold, which
was to stand, not in the holy of holies (nothing was in that but the ark
with its appurtenances), but in the outer part of the tabernacle, called
the sanctuary, or holy place, [Heb
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#002.md), [Heb
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#023.md), etc. There must also be the
usual furniture of the sideboard, dishes and spoons, etc., and all of
gold, [Exo 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#029.md). 2. This table was to
be always spread, and furnished with the show-bread ([Exo
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#030).md), or bread of faces, twelve
loaves, one for each tribe, set in two rows, six in a row; see the law
concerning them, [Lev 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#005.md), etc. The
tabernacle being God's house, in which he was pleased to say that he
would dwell among them, he would show that he kept a good house. In the
royal palace it was fit that there should be a royal table. Some make
the twelve loaves to represent the twelve tribes, set before God as his
people and the corn of his floor, as they are called, [Isa
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#010.md). As the ark signified God's
being present with them, so the twelve loaves signified their being
presented to God. This bread was designed to be, (1.) A thankful
acknowledgement of God's goodness to them, in giving them their daily
bread, manna in the wilderness, where he prepared a table for them, and,
in Canaan, the corn of the land. Hereby they owned their dependence upon
Providence, not only for the corn in the field, which they gave thanks
for in offering the sheaf of first-fruits, but for the bread in their
houses, that, when it was brought home, God did not blow upon it, [Hag
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#009.md). Christ has taught us to pray
every day for the bread of the day. (2.) A token of their communion with
God. This bread on God's table being made of the same corn with the
bread on their own tables, God and Israel did, as it were, eat together,
as a pledge of friendship and fellowship; he supped with them, and they
with him. (3.) A type of the spiritual provision which is made in the
church, by the gospel of Christ, for all that are made priests to our
God. In our Father's house there is bread enough and to spare, a loaf
for every tribe. All that attend in God's house shall be abundantly
satisfied with the goodness of it, [Psa
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008.md). Divine consolations are the
continual feast of holy souls, notwithstanding there are those to whom
the table of the Lord, and the meat thereof (because it is plain bread),
are contemptible, [Mal 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#012.md). Christ
has a table in his kingdom, at which all his saints shall for every eat
and drink with him, [Luk 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#030.md).

[Exodus 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">exo 25:31</span></span>

I. The next thing ordered to be made for the furnishing of God's palace
was a rich stately candlestick, all of pure gold, not hollow, but solid.
The particular directions here given concerning it show, 1. That it was
very magnificent, and a great ornament to the place; it had many
branches drawn from the main shaft, which had not only their bowls (to
put the oil and the kindled wick in) for necessity, but knops and
flowers for ornament. 2. That it was very convenient, and admirably
contrived both to scatter the light and to keep the tabernacle clean
from smoke and snuffs. 3. That it was very significant. The tabernacle
had no windows by which to let in the light of the day, all its light
was candle-light, which intimates the comparative darkness of that
dispensation, while the Sun or righteousness had not as yet risen, nor
had the day-star from on high yet visited his church. Yet God left not
himself without witness, nor them without instruction; the commandment
was a lamp, and the law a light, and the prophets were branches from
that lamp, which gave light in their several ages to the Old Testament
church. The church is still dark, as the tabernacle was, in comparison
with what it will be in heaven; but the word of God is the candlestick,
a light shining in a dark place ([Pe2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019).md), and a dark place indeed the
world would be without it. The Spirit of God, in his various gifts and
graces, is compared to the seven lamps which burn before the throne,
[Rev 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#005.md). The churches are golden
candlesticks, the lights of the world, holding forth the word of life as
the candlestick does the light, [Phi
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015.md), [Phi
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016.md). Ministers are to light the
lamps, and snuff them ([Exo 25:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#037).md), by
opening the scriptures. The treasure of this light is now put into
earthen vessels, [Co2 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006.md), [Co2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007.md). The branches of the candlestick
spread every way, to denote the diffusing of the light of the gospel
into all parts by the Christian ministry, [Mat
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014.md), [Mat
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#015.md). There is a diversity of gifts,
but the same Spirit gives to each to profit withal.

II\. There is in the midst of these instructions an express caution
given to Moses, to take heed of varying from his model: Make them after
the pattern shown thee, [Exo 25:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#040.md).
Nothing was left to his own invention, or the fancy of the workmen, or
the people's humour; but the will of God must be religiously observed in
every particular. Thus, 1. All God's providences are exactly according
to his counsels, and the copy never varies from the original. Infinite
Wisdom never changes its measures; whatever is purposed shall
undoubtedly be performed. 2. All his ordinances must be administered
according to his institutions. Christ's instruction to his disciples
([Mat 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020).md) is similar to this:
Observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.
