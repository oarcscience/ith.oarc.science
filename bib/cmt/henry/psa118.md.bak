### [Psalms Chapter 118](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 118:0</span></span>

It is probable that David penned this psalm when he had, after many a
story, weathered his point at last, and gained a full possession of the
kingdom to which he had been anointed. He then invites and stirs up his
friends to join with him, not only in a cheerful acknowledgment of God's
goodness and a cheerful dependence upon that goodness for the future,
but in a believing expectation of the promised Messiah, of whose kingdom
and his exaltation to it his were typical. To him, it is certain, the
prophet here bears witness, in the latter part of the psalm. Christ
himself applies it to himself ([Mat
21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042).md), and the former part of the
psalm may fairly, and without forcing, be accommodated to him and his
undertaking. Some think it was first calculated for the solemnity of the
bringing of the ark to the city of David, and was afterwards sung at the
feast of tabernacles. In it, I. David calls upon all about him to give
to God the glory of his goodness ([Psa
118:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#001).md). II. He encourages himself
and others to trust in God, from the experience he had had of God's
power and pity in the great and kind things he had done for him ([Psa
118:5-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005).md). III. He gives thanks for
his advancement to the throne, as it was a figure of the exaltation of
Christ ([Psa 118:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#019).md). IV. The
people, the priests, and the psalmist himself, triumph in the prospect
of the Redeemer's kingdom ([Psa
118:24-29](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#024).md). In singing this psalm we
must glorify God for his goodness, his goodness to us, and especially
his goodness to us in Jesus Christ.

[Psalms 118:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 118:1</span></span>

It appears here, as often as elsewhere, that David had his heart full of
the goodness of God. He loved to think of it, loved to speak of it, and
was very solicitous that God might have the praise of it and others the
comfort of it. The more our hearts are impressed with a sense of God's
goodness the more they will be enlarged in all manner of obedience. In
these verses,

I. He celebrates God's mercy in general, and calls upon others to
acknowledge it, from their own experience of it ([Psa
118:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#001).md): O give thanks unto the Lord,
for he is not only good in himself, but good to you, and his mercy
endures for ever, not only in the everlasting fountain, God himself, but
in the never-failing streams of that mercy, which shall run parallel
with the longest line of eternity, and in the chosen vessels of mercy,
who will be everlasting monuments of it. Israel, and the house of Aaron,
and all that fear God, were called upon to trust in God ([Psa
115:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#009).md); here they are called upon
to confess that his mercy endures for ever, and so to encourage
themselves to trust in him, [Psa
118:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#002.md). Priests and people, Jews and
proselytes, must all own God's goodness, and all join in the same
thankful song; if they can say no more, let them say this for him, that
his mercy endures for ever, that they have had experience of it all
their days, and confide in it for good things that shall last for ever.
The praises and thanksgivings of all that truly fear the Lord shall be
as pleasing to him as those of the house of Israel or the house of
Aaron.

II\. He preserves an account of God's gracious dealings with him in
particular, which he communicates to others, that they might thence
fetch both songs of praise and supports of faith, and both ways God
would have the glory. David had, in his time, waded through a great deal
of difficulty, which gave him great experience of God's goodness. Let us
therefore observe here,

1\. The great distress and danger that he had been in, which he reflects
upon for the magnifying of God's goodness to him in his present
advancement. There are many who, when they are lifted up, care not for
hearing or speaking of their former depressions; but David takes all
occasions to remember his own low estate. He was in distress ([Psa
118:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005).md), greatly straitened and at a
loss; there were many that hated him ([Psa
118:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#007).md), and this could not but be a
great grief to one of an ingenuous spirit, that strove to gain the good
affections of all. All nations compassed me about, [Psa
118:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#010.md). All the nations adjacent to
Israel set themselves to give disturbance to David, when he had newly
come to the throne, Philistines, Moabites, Syrians, Ammonites, etc. We
read of his enemies round about; they were confederate against him, and
thought to cut off all succours from him. This endeavour of his enemies
to surround him is repeated ([Psa
118:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#011).md): They compassed me about, yea,
they compassed me about, which intimates that they were virulent and
violent, and, for a time, prevalent, in their attempts against him, and
when put into disorder they rallied again and pushed on their design.
They compassed me about like bees, so numerous were they, so noisy, so
vexatious; they came flying upon him, came upon him in swarms, set upon
him with their malignant stings; but it was to their own destruction, as
the bee, they say, loses her life with her sting, Animamque in vulnere
ponit - She lays down her life in the wound. Lord, how are those
increased that trouble me! Two ways David was brought into trouble: -
(1.) By the injuries that men did him ([Psa
118:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#013)): Thou (O enemy!.md) hast thrust
sore at me, with many a desperate push, that I might fall into sin and
into ruin. Thrusting thou hast thrust at me (so the word is), so that I
was ready to fall. Satan is the great enemy that thrusts sorely at us by
his temptations, to cast us down from our excellency, that we may fall
from our God and from our comfort in him; and, if Go had not upheld us
by his grace, his thrusts would have been fatal to us. (2.) By the
afflictions which God laid upon him ([Psa
118:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#018).md): The Lord has chastened me
sore. Men thrust at him for his destruction; God chastened him for his
instruction. They thrust at him with the malice of enemies; God
chastened him with the love and tenderness of a Father. Perhaps he
refers to the same trouble which God, the author of it, designed for his
profit, that by it he might partake of his holiness ([Heb
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#010.md), [Heb
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#011).md); howbeit, men, who were the
instruments of it, meant not so, neither did their heart think so, but
it was in their heart to cut off and destroy, [Isa
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#007.md). What men intend for the greatest
mischief God intends for the greatest good, and it is easy to say whose
counsel shall stand. God will sanctify the trouble to his people, as it
is his chastening, and secure the good he designs; and he will guard
them against the trouble, as it is the enemies' thrusting, and secure
them from the evil they design, and then we need not fear.

This account which David gives of his troubles is very applicable to our
Lord Jesus. Many there were that hated him, hated him without a cause.
They compassed him about; Jews and Romans surrounded him. They thrust
sorely at him; the devil did so when he tempted him; his persecutors did
so when they reviled him; nay, the Lord himself chastened him sorely,
bruised him, and put him to grief, that by his stripes we might be
healed.

2\. The favour God vouchsafed to him in his distress. (1.) God heart his
prayer ([Psa 118:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005).md): "He answered me
with enlargements; he did more for me than I was able to ask; he
enlarged my heart in prayer and yet gave more largely than I desired."
He answered me, and set me in a large place (so we read it), where I had
room to bestir myself, room to enjoy myself, and room to thrive; and the
large place was the more comfortable because he was brought to it out of
distress, [Psa 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001). (2..md) God baffled
the designs of his enemies against him: They are quenched as the fire of
thorns ([Psa 118:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#012).md), which burns
furiously for a while, makes a great noise and a great blaze, but is
presently out, and cannot do the mischief that it threatened. Such was
the fury of David's enemies; such is the laughter of the fool, like the
crackling of thorns under a pot ([Ecc
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#006).md), and such is the anger of the
fool, which therefore is not to be feared, any more than his laughter is
to be envied, but both to be pitied. They thrust sorely at him, but the
Lord helped him ([Psa 118:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#013).md), helped
him to keep his feet and maintain his ground. Our spiritual enemies
would, long before this, have been our ruin if God had not been our
helper. (3.) God preserved his life when there was but a step between
him and death ([Psa 118:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#018).md): "He has
chastened me, but he has not given me over unto death, for he has not
given me over to the will of my enemies." To this St. Paul seems to
refer in [Co2 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#009.md). As dying, and
behold we live; as chastened, and not killed. We ought not therefore,
when we are chastened sorely, immediately to despair of life, for God
sometimes, in appearance, turns men to destruction, and yet says,
Return; says unto them, Live.

This also is applicable to Jesus Christ. God answered him, and set him
in a large place. He quenched the fire of his enemies; rage, which did
but consume themselves; for through death he destroyed him that had the
power of death. He helped him through his undertaking; and thus far he
did not give him over unto death that he did not leave him in the grave,
nor suffer him to see corruption. Death had no dominion over him.

3\. The improvement he made of this favour. (1.) It encouraged him to
trust in God; from his own experience he can say, It is better, more
wise, more comfortable, and more safe, there is more reason for it, and
it will speed better, to trust in the Lord, than to put confidence in
man, yea, though it be in princes, [Psa
118:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#008.md), [Psa
118:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#009.md). He that devotes himself to
God's guidance and government, with an entire dependence upon God's
wisdom, power, and goodness, has a better security to make him easy than
if all the kings and potentates of the earth should undertake to protect
him. (2.) It enabled him to triumph in that trust. \[1.\] He triumphs in
God, and in his relation to him and interest in him ([Psa
118:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#006).md): "The Lord is on my side. He is
a righteous God, and therefore espouses my righteous cause and will
plead it." If we are on God's side, he is on ours; if we be for him and
with him, he will be for us and with us ([Psa
118:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#007).md): "The Lord takes my part, and
stands up for me, with those that help me. He is to me among my helpers,
and so one of them that he is all in all both to them and me, and
without him I could not help myself nor could any friend I have in the
world help me." Thus ([Psa 118:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#014).md),
"The Lord is my strength and my song; that is, I make him so (without
him I am weak and sad, but on him I stay myself as my strength, both for
doing and suffering, and in him I solace myself as my song, by which I
both express my joy and ease my grief), and, making him so, I find him
so: he strengthens my heart with his graces and gladdens my heart with
his comforts." If God be our strength, he must be our song; if he work
all our works in us, he must have all praise and glory from us. God is
sometimes the strength of his people when he is not their song; they
have spiritual supports when they want spiritual delights. But, if he be
both to us, we have abundant reason to triumph in him; for, he be our
strength and our song, he has become not only our Saviour, but our
salvation; for his being our strength is our protection to the
salvation, and his being our song is an earnest and foretaste of the
salvation. \[2.\] He triumphs over his enemies. Now shall his head be
lifted up above them; for, First, He is sure they cannot hurt him: "God
is for me, and then I will not fear what man can do against me," [Psa
118:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#006.md). He can set them all at
defiance, and is not disturbed at any of their attempts. "They can do
nothing to me but what God permits them to do; they can do no real
damage, for they cannot separate between me and God; they cannot do any
thing but what God can make to work for my good. The enemy is a man, a
depending creature, whose power is limited, and subordinate to a higher
power, and therefore I will not fear him." Who art thou, that thou
shouldst be afraid of a man that shall die? [Isa
51:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#012.md). The apostle quotes this, with
application to all Christians, [Heb
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#006.md). They may boldly say, as boldly
as David himself, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man
shall do unto me; let him do his worst. Secondly, He is sure that he
shall be too hard for them at last: "I shall see my desire upon those
that hate me ([Psa 118:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#007).md); I shall see
them defeated in their designs against me; nay, In the name of the Lord
I will destroy them ([Psa 118:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#010).md);
I trust in the name of the Lord that I shall destroy them, and in his
name I will go forth against them, depending on his strength, by warrant
from him, and with an eye to his glory, not confiding in myself nor
taking vengeance for myself." Thus he went forth against Goliath, in the
name of the God of Israel, [Sa1 17:45](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#045.md).
David says this as a type of Christ, who triumphed over the powers of
darkness, destroyed them, and made a show of them openly. \[3.\] He
triumphs in an assurance of the continuance of his comfort, his victory,
and his life. First, Of his comfort ([Psa
118:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#015).md): The voice of rejoicing and
salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous, and in mine
particularly, in my family. The dwellings of the righteous in this world
are but tabernacles, mean and movable; here we have no city, no
continuing city. But these tabernacles are more comfortable to them than
the palaces of the wicked are to them; for in the house where religion
rules, 1. There is salvation; safety from evil, earnests of eternal
salvation, which has come to this house, [Luk
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#009.md). 2. Where there is salvation
there is cause for rejoicing, for continual joy in God. Holy joy is
called the joy of salvation, for in that there is abundant matter for
joy. 3. Where there is rejoicing there ought to be the voice of
rejoicing, that is, praise and thanksgiving. Let God be served with
joyfulness and gladness of heart, and let the voice of that rejoicing be
heard daily in our families, to the glory of God and encouragement of
others. Secondly, Of his victory: The right hand of the Lord does
valiantly ([Psa 118:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#015).md) and is
exalted; for (as some read it) it has exalted me. The right hand of
God's power is engaged for his people, and it acts vigorously for them
and therefore victoriously. For what difficulty can stand before the
divine valour? We are weak, and act but cowardly for ourselves; but God
is mighty, and acts valiantly for us, with jealousy and resolution, [Isa
63:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#005.md), [Isa
63:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#006.md). There is spirit, as well as
strength, in all God's operations for his people. And, when God's right
hand does valiantly for our salvation, it ought to be exalted in our
praises. Thirdly, Of his life ([Psa
118:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#017).md): "I shall not die by the hands
of my enemies that seek my life, but live and declare the works of the
Lord; I shall live a monument of God's mercy and power; his works shall
be declared in me, and I will make it the business of my life to praise
and magnify God, looking upon that as the end of my preservation." Note,
It is not worth while to live for any other purpose than to declare the
works of God, for his honour and the encouragement of others to serve
him and trust in him. Such as these were the triumphs of the Son of
David in the assurance he had of the success of his undertaking and that
the good pleasure of the Lord should prosper in his hand.

[Psalms 118:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 118:19</span></span>

We have here an illustrious prophecy of the humiliation and exaltation
of our Lord Jesus, his sufferings, and the glory that should follow.
Peter thus applies it directly to the chief priests and scribes, and
none of them could charge him with misapplying it, [Act
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011.md). Now observe here,

I. The preface with which this precious prophecy is introduced, [Psa
118:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#019.md). 1. The psalmist desires
admission into the sanctuary of God, there to celebrate the glory of him
that cometh in the name of the Lord: Open to me the gates of
righteousness. So the temple-gates are called, because they were shut
against the uncircumcised, and forbade the stranger to come nigh, as the
sacrifices there offered are called sacrifices of righteousness. Those
that would enter into communion with God in holy ordinances must become
humble suitors to God for admission. And when the gates of righteousness
are opened to us we must go into them, must enter into the holiest, as
far as we have leave, and praise the Lord. Our business within God's
gates is to praise God; therefore we should long till the gates of
heaven be opened to us, that we may go into them to dwell in God's house
above, where we shall be still praising him. 2. He sees admission
granted him ([Psa 118:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#020).md): This is the
gate of the Lord, the gate of his appointing, into which the righteous
shall enter; as if he had said, "The gate you knocked at is opened, and
you are welcome. Knock, and it shall be opened unto you." Some by this
gate understand Christ, by whom we are taken into fellowship with God
and our praises are accepted; he is the way; there is no coming to the
Father but by him ([Joh 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006).md), he is
the door of the sheep ([Joh 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#009).md); he
is the gate of the temple, by whom, and by whom only, the righteous, and
they only, shall enter, and come into God's righteousness, as the
expression is, [Psa 69:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#027.md). The
psalmist triumphs in the discovery that the gate of righteousness, which
had been so long shut, and so long knocked at, was now at length opened.
3. He promises to give thanks to God for this favour ([Psa
118:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#021).md): I will praise thee. Those
that saw Christ's day at so great a distance saw cause to praise God for
the prospect; for in him they saw that God had heard them, had heard the
prayers of the Old Testament saints for the coming of the Messiah, and
would be their salvation.

II\. The prophecy itself, [Psa 118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md),
[Psa 118:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#023.md). This may have some
reference to David's preferment; he was the stone which Saul and his
courtiers rejected, but was by the wonderful providence of God advanced
to be the headstone of the building. But its principal reference is to
Christ; and here we have, 1. His humiliation. He is the stone which the
builders refused; he is the stone cut out of the mountain without hands,
[Dan 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034.md). He is a stone, not only for
strength, and firmness, and duration, but for life, in the building of
the spiritual temple; and yet a precious stone ([Pe1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006).md), for the foundation of the
gospel-church must be sapphires, [Isa
54:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#011.md). This stone was rejected by the
builders, by the rulers and people of the Jews ([Act
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#008.md), [Act
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#010.md), [Act
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011).md); they refused to own him as the
stone, the Messiah promised; they would not build their faith upon him
nor join themselves to him; they would make no use of him, but go on in
their building without him; they denied him in the presence of Pilate
([Act 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#013).md) when they said, We have no
king but Caesar. They trampled upon this stone, threw it among the
rubbish out of the city; nay, they stumbled at it. This was a disgrace
to Christ, but it proved the ruin of those that thus made light of him.
Rejecters of Christ are rejected of God. 2. His exaltation. He has
become the headstone of the corner; he is advanced to the highest degree
both of honour and usefulness, to be above all, and all in all. He is
the chief corner-stone in the foundation, in whom Jew and Gentile are
united, that they may be built up one holy house. He is the chief
top-stone in the corner, in whom the building is completed, and who must
in all things have the pre-eminence, as the author and finisher of our
faith. Thus highly has God exalted him, because he humbled himself; and
we, in compliance with God's design, must make him the foundation of our
hope, the centre of our unity, and the end of our living. To me to live
is Christ. 3. The hand of God in all this: This is the Lord's doing; it
is from the Lord; it is with the Lord; it is the product of his counsel;
it is his contrivance. Both the humiliation and the exaltation of the
Lord Jesus were his work, [Act 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#023.md);
[Act 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#027.md), [Act
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#028.md). He sent him, sealed him; his
hand went with him throughout his whole undertaking, and from first to
last he did his Father's will; and this ought to be marvellous in our
eyes. Christ's name is Wonderful; and the redemption he wrought out is
the most amazing of all God's works of wonder; it is what the angels
desire to look into, and will be admiring to eternity; much more ought
we to admire it, who owe our all to it. Without controversy, great is
the mystery of godliness.

III\. The joy wherewith it is entertained and the acclamations which
attend this prediction.

1\. Let the day be solemnized to the honour of God with great joy ([Psa
118:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#024).md): This is the day the Lord has
made. The whole time of the gospel-dispensation, that accepted time,
that day of salvation, is what the Lord has made so; it is a continual
feast, which ought to be kept with joy. Or it may very fitly be
understood of the Christian sabbath, which we sanctify in remembrance of
Christ's resurrection, when the rejected stone began to be exalted; and
so, (1.) Here is the doctrine of the Christian sabbath: It is the day
which the Lord has made, has made remarkable, made holy, has
distinguished from other days; he has made it for man: it is therefore
called the Lord's day, for it bears his image and superscription. (2.)
The duty of the sabbath, the work of the day that is to be done in his
day: We will rejoice and be glad in it, not only in the institution of
the day, that there is such a day appointed, but in the occasion of it,
Christ's becoming the head of the corner. This we ought to rejoice in
both as his honour and our advantage. Sabbath days must be rejoicing
days, and then they are to us as the days of heaven. See what a good
Master we serve, who, having instituted a day for his service, appoints
it to be spent in holy joy.

2\. Let the exalted Redeemer be met, and attended, with joyful hosannas,
[Psa 118:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025.md), [Psa
118:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#026.md).

(1.) Let him have the acclamations of the people, as is usual at the
inauguration of a prince. Let every one of his loyal subjects shout for
joy, Save now, I beseech thee, O Lord! This is like Vivat rex - Long
live the king, and expresses a hearty joy for his accession to the
crown, an entire satisfaction in his government, and a zealous affection
to the interests and honour of it. Hosanna signifies, Save now, I
beseech thee. \[1.\] "Lord, save me, I beseech thee; let this Saviour be
my Saviour, and, in order to that, my ruler; let me be taken under his
protection and owned as one of his willing subjects. His enemies are my
enemies; Lord, I beseech thee, save me from them. Send me an interest in
that prosperity which his kingdom brings with it to all those that
entertain it. Let my soul prosper and be in health, in that peace and
righteousness which his government brings, [Psa
72:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003.md). Let me have victory over those
lusts that war against my soul, and let divine grace go on in my heart
conquering and to conquer." \[2.\] "Lord, preserve him, I beseech thee,
even the Saviour himself, and send him prosperity in all his
undertakings; give success to his gospel, and let it be mighty, through
God, to the pulling down of strong-holds and reducing souls to their
allegiance to him. Let his name be sanctified, his kingdom come, his
will be done." Thus let prayer be made for him continually, [Psa
72:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015.md). On the Lord's day, when we
rejoice and are glad in his kingdom, we must pray for the advancement of
it more and more, and its establishment upon the ruins of the devil's
kingdom. When Christ made his public entry into Jerusalem he was thus
met by his well-wishers ([Mat 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009).md):
Hosanna to the Son of David; long live King Jesus; let him reign for
ever.

(2.) Let the priests, the Lord's ministers, do their part in this great
solemnity, [Psa 118:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#026.md). \[1.\] Let
them bless the prince with their praises: Blessed is he that cometh in
the name of the Lord. Jesus Christ is he that cometh - ho erchomenos, he
that was to come and is yet to come again, [Rev
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#008.md). He comes in the name of the Lord,
with a commission from him, to act for him, to do his will and to seek
his glory; and therefore we must say, Blessed be he that cometh; we must
rejoice that he has come; we must speak well of him, admire him, and
esteem him highly, as one we are eternally obliged to, call him blessed
Jesus, blessed for ever, [Psa 45:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#002.md). We
must bid him welcome into our hearts, saying, "Come in, thou blessed of
the Lord; come in by thy grace and Spirit, and take possession of me for
thy own." We must bless his faithful ministers that come in his name,
and receive them for his sake, [Isa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007.md); [Joh
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#020.md). We must pray for the
enlargement and edification of his church, for the ripening of things
for his second coming, and then that he who has said, Surely I come
quickly, would even so come. \[2.\] Let them bless the people with their
prayers: We have blessed you out of the house of the Lord. Christ's
ministers are not only warranted, but appointed to pronounce a blessing,
in his name, upon all his loyal subjects that love him and his
government in sincerity, [Eph 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#024.md). We
assure you that in and through Jesus Christ you are blessed; for he came
to bless you. "You are blessed out of the house of the Lord, that is,
with spiritual blessings in heavenly places ([Eph
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003).md), and therefore have reason to
bless him who has thus blessed you."

3\. Let sacrifices of thanksgiving be offered to his honour who offered
for us the great atoning sacrifice, [Psa
118:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#027). Here is, (1..md) The privilege we
enjoy by Jesus Christ: God is the Lord who has shown us light. God is
Jehovah, is known by that name, a God performing what he has promised
and perfecting what he has begun, [Exo
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003.md). He has shown us light, that is,
he has given us the knowledge of himself and his will. He has shined
upon us (so some); he has favoured us, and lifted up upon us the light
of his countenance; he has given us occasion for joy and rejoicing,
which is light to the soul, by giving us a prospect of everlasting light
in heaven. The day which the Lord has made brings light with it, true
light. (2.) The duty which this privilege calls for: Bind the sacrifice
with cords, that, being killed, the blood of it may be sprinkled upon
the horns of the altar, according to the law; or perhaps it was the
custom (though we read not of it elsewhere) to bind the sacrifice to the
horns of the altar while things were getting ready for the slaying of
it. Or this may have a peculiar significancy here; the sacrifice we are
to offer to God, in gratitude for redeeming love, is ourselves, not to
be slain upon the altar, but living sacrifices ([Rom
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001).md), to be bound to the altar,
spiritual sacrifices of prayer and praise, in which our hearts must be
fixed and engaged, as the sacrifice was bound with cords to the horns of
the altar, not to start back.

4\. The psalmist concludes with his own thankful acknowledgments of
divine grace, in which he calls upon others to join with him, [Psa
118:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#028.md), [Psa
118:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#029). (1..md) He will praise God
himself, and endeavour to exalt him in his own heart and in the hearts
of others, and this because of his covenant-relation to him and interest
in him: "Thou art my God, on whom I depend, and to whom I am devoted,
who ownest me and art owned by me; and therefore I will praise thee."
(2.) He will have all about him to give thanks to God for these glad
tidings of great joy to all people, that there is a Redeemer, even
Christ the Lord. In him it is that God is good to man and that his mercy
endures for ever; in him the covenant of grace is made, and in him it is
made sure, made good, and made an everlasting covenant. He concludes
this psalm as he began it ([Psa
118:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#001).md), for God's glory must be the
Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, of all our addresses to him.
Hallowed by thy name, and thine is the glory. And this fitly closes a
prophecy of Christ. The angels give thanks for man's redemption. Glory
to God in the highest ([Luk 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014).md), for
there is on earth peace, to which we must echo with our hosannas, as
they did, [Luk 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#038.md). Peace in heaven
to us through Christ, and therefore glory in the highest.
