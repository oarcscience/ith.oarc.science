### [Joshua Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 15:0</span></span>

Though the land was not completely conquered, yet being (as was said in
the close of the foregoing chapter) as rest from war for the present,
and their armies all drawn out of the field to a general rendezvous at
Gilgal, there they began to divide the land, though the work was
afterwards perfected at Shiloh, [Jos
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001.md), etc. In this chapter we have the
lot of the tribe of Judah, which in this, as in other things, had the
precedency. I. The borders or bounds of the inheritance of Judah ([Jos
15:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#001).md). II. The particular
assignment of Hebron and the country thereabout to Caleb and his family
([Jos 15:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#013).md). III. The names of the
several cities that fell within Judah's lot (v. 20-63).

[Joshua 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 15:1</span></span>

Judah and Joseph were the two sons of Jacob on whom Reuben's forfeited
birth-right devolved. Judah had the dominion entailed on him, and Joseph
the double portion, and therefore these two tribes were first seated,
Judah in the southern part of the land of Canaan and Joseph in the
northern part, and on them the other seven did attend, and had their
respective lots as appurtenances to these two; the lots of Benjamin,
Simeon, and Dan, were appendant to Judah, and those of Issachar and
Zebulun, Naphtali and Asher, to Joseph. These two were first set up to
be provided for, it should seem, before there was such an exact survey
of the land as we find afterwards, [Jos
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#009.md). It is probable that the most
considerable parts of the northern and southern countries, and those
that lay nearest to Gilgal, and which the people were best acquainted
with, were first put into two portions, and the lot was cast upon them
between these two principal tribes, of the one of which Joshua was, and
of the other Caleb, who was the first commissioner in this writ of
partition; and, by the decision of that lot, the southern country, of
which we have an account in this chapter, fell to Judah, and the
northern, of which we have an account in the two following chapters, to
Joseph. And when this was done there was a more equal dividend (either
in quantity or quality) of the remainder among the seven tribes. And
this, probably, was intended in that general rule which was given
concerning this partition ([Num
33:54](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#054).md), to the more you shall give the
more inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the less, and every
man's inheritance shall be where his lot falleth; that is, "You shall
appoint two greater portions which shall be determined by lot to those
more numerous tribes of Judah and Joseph, and then the rest shall be
less portions to be allotted to the less numerous tribes." The former
was done in Gilgal, the latter in Shiloh.

In these verses, we have the borders of the lot of Judah, which, as the
rest, is said to be by their families, that is, with an eye to the
number of their families. And it intimates that Joshua and Eleazar, and
the rest of the commissioners, when they had by lot given each tribe its
portion, did afterwards (it is probable by lot likewise) subdivide those
larger portions, and assign to each family its inheritance, and then to
each household, which would be better done by this supreme authority,
and be apt to give less disgust than if it had been left to the inferior
magistrates of each tribe to make that distribution. The borders of this
tribe are here largely fixed, yet not unalterably, for a good deal of
that which lies within these bounds was afterwards assigned to the lots
of Simeon and Dan. 1. The eastern border was all, and only, the Salt
Sea, [Jos 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#005.md). Every sea is salt, but
this was of an extraordinary and more than natural saltness, the effects
of that fire and brimstone with which Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed
in Abraham's time, whose ruins lie buried in the bottom of this dead
water, which never either was moved itself or had any living thing in
it. 2. The southern border was that of the land of Canaan in general, as
will appear by comparing [Jos 15:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#001.md)
with [Num 34:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#003.md). So that this
powerful and warlike tribe of Judah guarded the frontiers of the whole
land, on that side which lay towards their old sworn enemies (though
their two fathers were twin-brethren), the Edomites. Our Lord therefore,
who sprang out of Judah, and whose the kingdom is, shall judge the mount
of Esau, [Oba 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#021.md). 3. The northern
border divided it from the lot of Benjamin. In this, mention is made of
the stone of Bohan a Reubenite ([Jos
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#006).md), who probably was a great
commander of those forces of Reuben that came over Jordan, and died in
the camp at Gilgal, and was buried not far off under this stone. The
valley of Achor likewise lies upon this border ([Jos
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#007).md), to remind the men of Judah of
the trouble which Achan, one of their tribe, gave to the congregation of
Israel, that they might not be too much lifted up with their services.
This northern line touched closely upon Jerusalem ([Jos
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#008).md), so closely as to include in the
lot of this tribe Mount Zion and Mount Moriah, though the greater part
of the city lay in the lot of Benjamin. 4. The west border went near to
the great sea at first ([Jos 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#012).md),
but afterwards the lot of the tribe of Dan took off a good part of
Judah's lot on that side; for the lot was only to determine between
Judah and Joseph, which should have the north and which the south, and
not immovably to fix the border of either. Judah's inheritance had its
boundaries determined. Though it was a powerful warlike tribe, and had a
great interest in the other tribes, yet they must not therefore be left
to their own choice, to enlarge their possessions at pleasure, but must
live so as that their neighbours might live by them. Those that are
placed high yet must not think to be placed alone in the midst of the
earth.

[Joshua 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 15:13</span></span>

The historian seems pleased with every occasion to make mention of Caleb
and to do him honour, because he had honoured God in following him
fully. Observe,

I. The grant Joshua made him of the mountain of Hebron for his
inheritance is here repeated ([Jos
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#013).md), and it is said to be given
him. 1. According to the commandment of the Lord to Joshua. Though
Caleb, in his petition, had made out a very good title to it by promise,
yet, because God had ordered Joshua to divide the land by lot, he would
not in this one single instance, no, not to gratify his old friend
Caleb, do otherwise, without orders from God, whose oracle, it is
probable, he consulted upon this occasion. In every doubtful case it is
very desirable to know the mind of God, and to see the way of our duty
plain. 2. It is said to be a part among the children of Judah; though it
was assigned him before the lot of that tribe came up, yet it proved,
God so directing the lot, to be in the heart of that tribe, which was
graciously ordered in kindness to him, that he might not be as one
separated from his brethren and surrounded by those of other tribes.

II\. Caleb having obtained this grant, we are told,

1\. How he signalized his own valour in the conquest of Hebron ([Jos
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#014).md): He drove thence the three sons
of Anak, he and those that he engaged to assist him in this service.
This is mentioned here to show that the confidence he had expressed of
success in this affair, through the presence of God with him ([Jos
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#012).md), did not deceive him, but the
event answered his expectation. It is not said that he slew these
giants, but he drove them thence, which intimates that they retired upon
his approach and fled before him; the strength and stature of their
bodies could not keep up the courage of their minds, but with the
countenances of lions they had the hearts of trembling hares. Thus does
God often cut off the spirit of princes ([Psa
76:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#012).md), take away the heart of the
chief of the people ([Job 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#024).md), and
so shame the confidence of the proud; and thus if we resist the devil,
that roaring lion, though he fall not, yet he will flee.

2\. How he encouraged the valour of those about him in the conquest of
Debir, [Jos 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#015.md), etc. It seems,
though Joshua had once made himself master of Debir ([Jos
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#039).md), yet the Canaanites had
regained the possession in the absence of the army, so that the work had
to be done a second time; and when Caleb had completed the reduction of
Hebron, which was for himself and his own family, to show his zeal for
the public good, as much as for his own private interest, he pushes on
his conquest to Debir, and will not lay down his arms till he sees that
city also effectually reduced, which lay but ten miles southward from
Hebron, though he had not any particular concern in it, but the reducing
of it would be to the general advantage of his tribe. Let us learn hence
not to seek and mind our own things only, but to concern and engage
ourselves for the welfare of the community we are members of; we are not
born for ourselves, nor must we live to ourselves.

(1.) Notice is taken of the name of this city. It had been called
Kirjath-sepher, the city of a book, and Kirjath-sannah ([Jos
15:49](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#049).md), which some translate the city
of learning (so the Septuagint Polis grammaton), whence some conjecture
that it had been a university among the Canaanites, like Athens in
Greece, in which their youth were educated; or perhaps the books of
their chronicles or records, or the antiquities of the nation, were laid
up there; and, it may be, this was it that made Caleb so desirous to see
Israel master of this city, that they might get acquainted with the
ancient learning of the Canaanites.

(2.) The proffer that Caleb made of his daughter, and a good portion
with her, to any one that would undertake to reduce that city, and to
command the forces that should be employed in that service, [Jos
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#016.md). Thus Saul promised a daughter
to him that would kill Goliath ([Sa1
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#025).md), neither of them intending to
force his daughter to marry such as she could not love, but both of them
presuming upon their daughters' obedience, and submission to their
fathers' will, though it might be contrary to their own humour or
inclination. Caleb's family was not long honourable and wealthy, but
religious; he that himself followed the Lord fully no doubt taught his
children to do so, and therefore it could not but be a desirable match
to any young gentleman. Caleb, in making the proposal, aims, \[1.\] To
do service to his country by the reducing of that important place; and,
\[2.\] To marry a daughter well, to a man of learning, that would have a
particular affection for the city of books, and a man of war, that would
be likely to serve his country, and do worthily in his generation. Could
he but marry his child to a man of such a character, he would think her
well bestowed, whether the share in the lot of his tribe were more or
less.

(3.) The place was bravely taken by Othniel, a nephew of Caleb, whom
probably Caleb had thoughts of when he made the proffer, [Jos
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#017.md). This Othniel, who thus
signalized himself when he was young, had long after, in his advanced
years, the honour to be both a deliverer and a judge in Israel, the
first single person that presided in their affairs after Joshua's death.
It is good for those who are setting out in the world to begin betimes
with that which is great and good, that, excelling in service when they
are young, they may excel in honour when they grow old.

(4.) Hereupon (all parties being agreed) Othniel married his
cousin-german Achsah, Caleb's daughter. It is probable that he had a
kindness for her before, which put him upon this bold undertaking to
obtain her. Love to his country, an ambition of honour, and a desire to
find favour with the princes of his people, might not have engaged him
in this great action, but his affection for Achsah did. This made it
intolerable to him to think that any one should do more to win her
favour than he would, and so inspired him with this generous fire. Thus
is love strong as death, and jealousy cruel as the grave.

(5.) Because the historian is now upon the dividing of the land, he
gives us an account of Achsah's portion, which was in land, as more
valuable because enjoyed by virtue of the divine promise, though we may
suppose the conquerors of Canaan, who had had the spoil of so many rich
cities, were full of money too. \[1.\] Some land she obtained by Caleb's
free grant, which was allowed while she married within her own tribe and
family, as Zelophehad's daughters did. He gave her a south land, [Jos
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#019.md). Land indeed, but a south land,
dry, and apt to be parched. \[2.\] She obtained more upon her request;
she would have had her husband to ask for a field, probably some
particular field, or champaign ground, which belonged to Caleb's lot,
and joined to that south land which he had settled upon his daughter at
marriage. She thought her husband had the best interest in her father,
who, no doubt, was extremely pleased with his late glorious achievement,
but he thought it was more proper for her to ask, and she would be more
likely to prevail; accordingly she did, submitting to her husband's
judgment, though contrary to her own; and she managed the undertaking
with great address. First, She took the opportunity when her father
brought her home to the house of her husband, when the satisfaction of
having disposed of his daughter so well would make him think nothing too
much to do for her. Secondly, She lighted off her ass, in token of
respect and reverence to her father, whom she would honour still, as
much as before her marriage. She cried or sighed from off her ass, so
the Septuagint and the vulgar Latin read it; she expressed some grief
and concern, that she might give her father occasion to ask her what she
wanted. Thirdly, She calls it a blessing, because it would add much to
the comfort of her settlement; and she was sure that, since she married
not only with her father's consent, but in obedience to his command, he
would not deny her his blessing. Fourthly, She asks only for the water,
without which the ground she had would be of little use either for
tillage or pasture, but she means the field in which the springs of
water were. The modesty and reasonableness of her quest gave it a great
advantage. Earth without water would be like a tree without sap, or the
body of an animal without blood; therefore, when God gathered the waters
into one place, he wisely and graciously left some in every place, that
the earth might be enriched for the service of man. See [Psa
104:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#010.md), etc. Well, Achsah gained her
point; her father gave her what she asked, and perhaps more, for he gave
her the upper springs and the nether springs, two fields so called from
the springs that were in them, as we commonly distinguish between the
higher field and the lower field. Those who understand it but of one
field, watered both with the rain of heaven and the springs that issued
out of the bowels of the earth, give countenance to the allusion we
commonly make to this, when we pray for spiritual and heavenly blessings
which relate to our souls as blessings of the upper springs, and those
which relate to the body and the life that now is as blessings of the
nether springs.

From this story we learn, 1. That it is no breach of the tenth
commandment moderately to desire those comforts and conveniences of this
life which we see attainable in a fair and regular way. 2. That husbands
and wives should mutually advise, and jointly agree, about that which is
for the common good of their family; and much more should they concur in
asking of their heavenly Father the best blessings, those of the upper
springs. 3. That parents must never think that lost which is bestowed
upon their children for their real advantage, but must be free in giving
them portions as well as maintenance, especially when they are dutiful.
Caleb had sons ([Ch1 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#015).md), and yet
gave thus liberally to his daughter. Those parents forget themselves and
their relation who grudge their children what is convenient for them
when they can conveniently part with it.

[Joshua 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jos 15:20</span></span>

We have here a list of the several cities that fell within the lot of
the tribe of Judah, which are mentioned by name, that they might know
their own, and both keep it and keep to it, and might neither through
cowardice nor sloth lose the possession of what was their own.

I. The cities are here named, and numbered in several classes, which
they then could account for the reason of better than we can now. Here
are, 1. Some that are said to be the uttermost cities towards the coast
of Edom, [Jos 15:21-32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#021.md). Here are
thirty-eight named, and yet said to be twenty-nine ([Jos
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#032).md), because nine of these were
afterwards transferred to the lot of Simeon, and are reckoned as
belonging to that, as appears by comparing [Jos
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#002.md), etc.; therefore those only are
counted (though the rest are named) which remained to Judah. 2. Others
that are said to be in the valley ([Jos
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#033).md) are counted to be fourteen, yet
fifteen are named; but it is probable that Gederah and Gederathaim were
either two names or two parts of one and the same city. 3. Then sixteen
are named without any head of distinction, [Jos
15:37-41](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#037.md), and nine more, [Jos
15:42-44](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#042.md). 4. Then the three
Philistine-cities, Ekron, Ashdod, and Gaza, [Jos
15:45-47](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#045.md). 5. Cities in the mountains,
eleven in all ([Jos 15:48-51](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#048).md), nine
more ([Jos 15:52-54](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#052).md), ten more ([Jos
15:55-57](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#055).md), six more ([Jos
15:58](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#058.md), [Jos
15:59](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#059).md), then two ([Jos
15:60](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#060).md), and six in the wilderness, a
part of the country not so thick of inhabitants as some others were.

II\. Now here, 1. We do not find Bethlehem, which was afterwards the
city of David, and was ennobled by the birth of our Lord Jesus in it.
But that city, which at the best was but little among the thousands of
Judah ([Mic 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002).md), except that it was
thus dignified, was now so little as not to be accounted one of the
cities, but perhaps was one of the villages not named. Christ came to
give honour to the places he was related to, not to receive honour from
them. 2. Jerusalem is said to continue in the hands of the Jebusites
([Jos 15:63](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#063).md), for the children of
Judah could not drive them out, through their sluggishness, stupidity,
and unbelief. Had they attempted it with vigour and resolution, we have
reason to think God would not have been wanting to them to give them
success; but they could not do it, because they would not. Jerusalem was
afterwards to be the holy city, the royal city, the city of the great
King, the brightest ornament of all the land of Israel. God has designed
it should be so. It may therefore be justly looked upon as a punishment
of their neglect to conquer other cities which God had given them that
they were so long kept out of this. 3. Among the cities of Judah (in all
114) we meet with Libnah, which in Joram's days revolted, and probably
set up for a free independent state ([Kg2
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#022).md), and Lachish, where king Amaziah
was slain ([Kg1 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#019).md); it led the
dance in idolatry ([Mic 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#013).md); it was
the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion. Giloh, Ahithophel's town,
is here mentioned, and Tekoa, of which the prophet Amos was, and near
which Jehoshaphat obtained that glorious victory, [Ch2
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#020.md), etc., and Maresha, where Asa
was a conqueror. Many of the cities of this tribe occur in the history
of David's troubles. Adullam, Ziph, Keilah, Maon, Engedi, Ziklag, here
reckoned in this tribe, were places near which David had most of his
haunts; for, though sometimes Saul drove him out from the inheritance of
the Lord, yet he kept as close to it as he could. The wilderness of
Judah he frequented much, and in it John Baptist preached, and there the
kingdom of heaven commenced, [Mat 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001.md).
The riches of this country no doubt answered Jacob's blessing of this
tribe, that he should wash his garments in wine, [Gen
49:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#011.md). And, in general, Judah, thou
art he whom thy brethren shall praise, not envy.
