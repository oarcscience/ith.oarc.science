### [Ezekiel Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 21:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have, I. An explication of the prophecy in the close
of the foregoing chapter concerning the fire in the forest, which the
people complained they could not understand ([Eze
21:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#001).md), with directions to the
prophet to show himself deeply affected with it ([Eze
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#006.md), [Eze
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#007).md). II. A further prediction of the
sword that was coming upon the land, by which all should be laid waste;
and this expressed very emphatically ([Eze
21:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#008).md). III. A prospect given of the
king of Babylon's approach to Jerusalem, to which he was determined by
divination ([Eze 21:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#018).md). IV.
Sentence passed upon Zedekiah king of Judah ([Eze
21:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#025).md). V. The destruction of the
Ammonites by the sword foretold ([Eze
21:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#028).md). Thus is this chapter all
threatenings.

[Ezekiel 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 21:1</span></span>

The prophet had faithfully delivered the message he was entrusted with,
in the close of the foregoing chapter, in the terms wherein he received
it, not daring to add his own comment upon it; but, when he complained
that the people found fault with him for speaking parables, the word of
the Lord came to him again, and gave him a key to that figurative
discourse, that with it he might let the people into the meaning of it
and so silence that objection. For all men shall be rendered inexcusable
at God's bar and every mouth shall be stopped. Note, He that speaks with
tongues should pray that he may interpret, [Co1
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#013.md). When we speak to people about
their souls we should study plainness, and express ourselves as we may
be the best understood. Christ expounded his parables to his disciples,
[Mar 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#034.md). 1. The prophet is here more
plainly directed against whom to level the arrow of this prophecy. He
must drop his word towards the holy places ([Eze
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#002).md), towards Canaan the holy land,
Jerusalem the holy city, the temple the holy house. These were highly
dignified above other places; but, when they polluted them, that word
which used to drop in the holy places shall now drop against them:
Prophesy against the land of Israel. It was the honour of Israel that it
had prophets and prophecy; but these, being despised by them, are turned
against them. And justly is Zion battered with her own artillery, which
used to be employed against her adversaries, seeing she knew not how to
value it. 2. He is instructed, and is to instruct the people, in the
meaning of the fire that was threatened to consume the forest of the
south: it signified a sword drawn, the sword of war which should make
the land desolate ([Eze 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#003).md): Behold,
I am against thee, O land of Israel! There needs no more to make a
people miserable than to have God against them; for as, if he be for us,
we need not fear, whoever are against us, so, if he be against us, we
cannot hope, whoever are for us. And God's professing people, when they
revolt from him, set him against them, who used to be for them. Was the
fire there of God's kindling? The sword here is his sword, which he has
prepared, and which he will give commission to; it is he that will draw
it out of its sheath, where it had laid quiet and threatened no harm.
Note, When the sword is unsheathed among the nations God's hand must be
eyed and owned in it. Did the fire devour every green tree and every dry
tree? The sword in like manner shall cut off the righteous and the
wicked. Good and bad were involved in the common calamities of the
nation; the righteous were cut off from the land of Israel when they
were sent captives in Babylon, though perhaps few or none of them were
cut off from the land of the living; and it was a threatening omen to
the land of Israel that in the beginning of its troubles such excellent
men as Daniel and his fellows, and Ezekiel, were cut off from it and
conveyed to Babylon. But though the sword cut off the righteous and the
wicked (for it devours one as well as another, [Sa2
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#025).md), yet far be it from us to think
that the righteous are as the wicked, [Gen
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#025.md). No; God's graces and comforts
make a great difference when his providence seems to make none. The good
figs are sent into Babylon for their good, [Jer
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#005.md), [Jer
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#006.md). It is only in outward appearance
that there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked, [Ecc
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#002.md). But it speaks the greatness of
God's displeasure against the land of Israel. Well might it be said, His
eye shall not spare, when it shall not spare, no, not the righteous in
it. Since there are not righteous men sufficient to save the land, to
make the justice of God the more illustrious the few that there are
shall suffer with it, and God's mercy shall make it up to them some
other way. Did the fire burn up all faces from the south to the north?
The sword shall go forth against all flesh from the south to the north,
shall go forth, as God's sword, with a commission that cannot be
contested, with a force that cannot be resisted. Were all flesh made to
know that God kindled the fire? They shall be made to know that he has
drawn forth the sword, [Eze 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#005.md). And,
lastly, Shall the fire that is kindled never be quenched? So when this
sword of the Lord is drawn against Judah and Jerusalem the scabbard is
thrown away, and it shall never be sheathed: It shall not return any
more, till it has made a full end. 3. The prophet is ordered, by
expressions of his own grief and concern for these calamities that were
coming on, to try to make impressions of the like upon the people. When
he has delivered his message he must sigh ([Eze
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#006).md), must fetch many deep sighs,
with the breaking of his loins; he must sign as if his heart would
burst, sigh with bitterness, with other expressions of bitter sorrow,
and this publicly, in the sight of those to whom he delivered the
foregoing message, that this might be a sermon to their eyes as that was
to their ears; and it was well if both would work upon them. The prophet
must sign, though it was painful to himself and made his breast sore,
and though it is probable that the profane among the people would
ridicule him for it and call him a whining canting preacher. But, if we
be beside ourselves it is to God; and, if this be to be vile, we will be
yet more so. Note, Ministers, if they would affect others with the
things they speak of, must show that they are themselves in the greatest
sincerity affected with them, and must submit to that which may create
uneasiness to themselves, so that it will promote the ends of their
ministry. The people, observing the prophet to sigh so much and seeing
no visible occasion for it, would ask, "Wherefore sighest thou? These
sighs have some mystical meaning; let us know what it is." And he must
answer them ([Eze 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#007).md): "It is for
the tidings, the heavy tidings, that we shall hear shortly; the tidings
come (the judgments come which we hear the tidings of), they come apace,
and then you will all sigh; nay, that will not serve. every heart shall
melt and every spirit fail; your courage will all be gone and you will
have no animating considerations to support yourselves with. And, when
heart and spirit fail, it will follow of course that all hands will be
feeble and unable to fight, and all knees will be weak as water and
unable to flee or to stand their ground." Those who have God for them
when flesh and heart fail have him to be the strength of their heart;
but those who have God against them have no cordial for a fainting
spirit, but are as Belshazzar when his thoughts troubled him, [Dan
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#006.md). But some people are worse
frightened than hurt; may not the case be so here and the event prove
better than likely? No: Behold it cometh, and shall be brought to pass.
It is not a bugbear that they are frightened with, but according to the
fear so is the wrath, and more grievous than is feared.

[Ezekiel 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 21:8</span></span>

Here is another prophecy of the sword, which is delivered in a very
affecting manner; the expressions here used are somewhat intricate, and
perplex interpreters. The sword was unsheathed in the foregoing verses;
here it is fitted up to do execution, which the prophet is commanded to
lament. Observe,

I. How the sword is here described. 1. It is sharpened, that it may cut
and wound, and make a sore slaughter. The wrath of God will put an edge
upon it; and, whatever instruments God shall please to make use of in
executing his judgments, he will fill them with strength, courage, and
fury, according to the service they are employed in. Out of the mouth of
Christ goes a sharp sword, [Rev 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015.md).
2. It is furbished, that it may glitter, to the terror of those against
whom it is drawn. It shall be a kind of flaming sword. If it have rusted
in the scabbard for want of use, it shall be rubbed and brightened; for
though the glory of God's justice may seem to have been eclipsed for a
while, during the day of his patience and the delay of his judgments,
yet it will shine out again and be made to glitter. 3. It is a
victorious sword, nothing shall stand before it ([Eze
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#010).md): It contemneth the rod of my
son as every tree. Israel, said God once, is my son, my first-born. The
government of that people was called a rod, a strong rod; we read ([Eze
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#011).md) of the strong rods they had for
sceptres. But when the sword of God's justice is drawn it contemns this
rod, makes nothing of it; though it be a strong rod, and the rod of his
son, it is no more than any other tree. When God's professing people
have revolted from him, and are in rebellion against him, his sword
despises them. What are they to him more than another people? The
marginal reading gives another notion of this sword: It is the rod of my
son; and we know of whom God has said ([Psa
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007).md), Thou art my Son, this day have I
begotten thee, and ([Eze 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#009).md) Thou
shalt break them with a rod of iron. This sword is that rod of iron
which contemns every tree and will bear it down. Or, This sword is the
rod of my son, a correcting rod, for the chastening of the transgression
of God's people ([Sa2 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014).md), not to
cut them off from being a people. It is a sword to others, a rod to my
son.

II\. How the sword is here put into the hand of the executioners: "It is
the rod of my Son, and he has given it that it may be handled ([Eze
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#011).md), that it may be made use of for
the end for which it was drawn. It is given into the hand, not of the
fencer to be played with, but of the slayer to do execution with. The
sword of war my Son makes use of as a sword of justice, and to him all
judgment is committed. It is made bright ([Eze
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#015).md), it is wrapped up, that it may
be kept safe, and clean, and sharp for the slaughter, not as Goliath's
sword was wrapped up in a cloth only for a memorial," [Sa1
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#009.md).

III\. How the sword is directed, and against whom it is sent ([Eze
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#012).md): It shall be upon my people;
they shall fall by this sword. It is repeated again, as that which is
scarcely credible, that the sword of the heathen shall be upon God's own
people; nay, it shall be upon all the princes of Israel; their dignity
and power as princes shall be no more their security than their
profession of religion as princes of Israel. But, if the sword be at any
time upon God's people, have they not comfort within sufficient to arm
them against every thing in it that is frightful? Yes, they have, while
they conduct themselves as becomes his people; but these had not done
so, and therefore terrors, by reason of the sword, shall be upon those
that call themselves my people. Note, While good men are quiet, not only
from evil, but from the fear of it, wicked men are disturbed not only
with the sword, but with the terrors of it, arising from a consciousness
of their own guilt. This sword is directed particularly against the
great men, for they had been the greatest sinners among them; they had
altogether broken the yoke and burst the bonds ([Jer
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#005).md), and therefore with them in a
special manner God's controversy is, who had been the ringleaders in
sin. The sword of the slain is the sword of the great men that are
slain, [Eze 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#014.md). Though they have
furnished themselves with places of retirement, places of concealment,
where they flatter themselves with hopes that they shall be safe, they
will find that the sword will enter into their privy chambers, and find
them out there, as the frogs, when they were one of Egypt's plagues,
found admission into the chambers of their kings. The sword, the point
of this sword, is directed against their gates, against all their gates
([Eze 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#015).md), against all those things
with which they thought to keep it out and fortify themselves against
it. Note, The strongest gates, though they be gates of brass, ever so
well barred, ever so well guarded, are no fence against the point of the
sword of God's judgments. But when that is pointed against sinners, 1.
They are ready to fear the worst; their hearts faint, so that they are
not able to make any resistance. 2. The worst comes; whatever resistance
they make, it is to no purpose, but they are ruined, and their ruins are
multiplied. But what need have we to observe the particular directions
of this sword when it has a general commission, is sent with a running
warrant? ([Eze 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#016).md): "Go thee, one
way or other, which way thou wilt, turn to the right hand or to the
left, thou wilt find those that are obnoxious, for there are none free
from guilt; and thou hast authority against them, for there are none
exempt from punishment; and therefore, whithersoever thy face is set,
that way do thou proceed, and, like Jonathan's sword, from the blood of
the slain, from the fat of the mighty, thou shalt never return empty,"
[Sa2 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#022.md). Note, So full is the world
of wicked people that, which way soever God's judgments go forth, they
will find work, will find matter to work upon. That fire will never go
out on this earth for want of fuel. And such various methods God has of
meeting with sinners that the sword of his justice is still as it was at
first when it flamed in the hand of the cherubim: it turns every way,
[Gen 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#024.md).

IV\. What is the nature of this sword, and what are the intentions and
limitations of it as to the people of God, [Eze
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#013.md). It is a correction; it is
designed to be so; the sword to others is a rod to them. This is a
comfortable word which comes in in the midst of these terrible ones,
though it be expressed somewhat obscurely. 1. The people of God begin to
be afraid that the sword will contemn even the rod, that the sword will
go on with such fury that it will despise its commission to be a rod
only, will forget its bounds and become a sword indeed, even to God's
own people. They fear lest the Chaldeans' sword, which is the rod of
God's anger, contemn its being called a rod, and become as the axe that
boasts itself against him that heweth therewith or the staff that lifts
up itself as if it were no wood, [Isa
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#015.md). Or, "What if the sword contemn
even the rod? that is, what if this sword make the former rods, as that
or Sennacherib, to be contemned as nothing to this? What if this should
prove not a correcting rod, but a destroying sword, to make a full end
of our church and nation?" This is that which the thinking, but
timorous, few are apprehensive of. Note, When threatening judgments are
abroad it is good to suppose the worst that may be the consequences of
them, that we may provide accordingly. What if the sword contemn the
tribe or sceptre? namely, that of Judah and the house of David (so some
think Shebet here signifies); what if it should aim at the ruin of our
government? If it do, the Lord is righteous and will be gracious
notwithstanding. But, 2. These fears are silenced with an assurance that
it is not so; the sword shall not forget itself, nor the errand on which
it is sent: It is a trial, and it is no more than a trial. He that sends
it makes what use of it, and sets what bounds to it, he pleases. Here
shall its proud waves be stayed. Note, It is matter of comfort to the
people of God, when his judgments are abroad, and they are ready to
tremble for fear of them, that, whatever they are to others, to them
they are but trials; and, when they are tried, they shall come forth as
gold, and the proving of their faith shall be the improving of it.

V. Here the prophet and the people must show themselves affected with
these judgments threatened. 1. The prophet must be very serious in
denouncing these judgments. He must say, A sword! a sword! [Eze
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#009.md). Let him not study for fine
words, and a variety of quaint expressions; when the town is on fire
people do not so give notice of it, but cry, with a frightful doleful
voice, Fire! fire! So must the prophet cry, A sword! a sword! and ([Eze
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#014).md), Let the sword be doubled the
third time in thy preaching. God speaks once, yea, twice, yea, thrice;
it were well if men, after all, would perceive and regard it. It shall
be doubled the third time in God's providence; for it was
Nebuchadnezzar's third descent upon Jerusalem that made a full end of
it. Ruin comes gradually, but at last comes effectually, upon a
provoking people. Yet this is not all: the prophet is not only as a
herald at arms to proclaim war, and to cry, A sword! a sword! once and
again, and a third time, but, as a person nearly concerned, he must cry
and howl ([Eze 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#012).md), must sadly
lament the desolations that the sword would make, as one that did
himself not only sympathize with the sufferers, but feel from the
sufferings. Again ([Eze 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#014).md),
Prophesy, and smite thy hands together, wring thy hands, as lamenting
the desolation, or clap thy hands, as by thy prophecy instigating and
encouraging those that were to be the instruments of it, or as one
standing amazed at the suddenness and severity of the judgment. The
prophet must smite his hands together; for (says God) I will also smite
my hands together, [Eze 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#017.md). God is
in earnest in pronouncing this sentence upon them, and therefore the
prophet must show himself in earnest in publishing it. God's smiting his
hands together, as well as the prophet's smiting, is in token of a holy
indignation at their wickedness, which was really very astonishing. When
Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam he smote his hands together,
[Num 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#010.md). Note, God and his
ministers are justly angry at those who might be saved and yet will be
ruined. Some make it an expression of triumph and exultation, agreeing
with that ([Isa 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024).md), Ah! I will ease
me of my adversaries; and that ([Pro
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#026).md), I also will laugh at their
calamity. And so it follows here, I will cause my fury to rest, not only
it shall be perfected, but it shall be pleased. And observe with what
solemnity, with what authority, this sentence is ratified: "I the Lord
have said it, who can and will make good what I have said. I have said
it, and will never unsay it. I have said it, and who can gainsay it?" 2.
The people must be very serious in the prospect of these judgments. An
intimation of this comes in in a parenthesis ([Eze
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#010).md): Should we then make mirth?
Seeing God has drawn the sword, and the prophet sighs and cries, Should
we then make mirth? The prophet seems to give this as a reason why he
sighs; as [Neh 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#003.md), Why should not my
countenance be sad, when Jerusalem lies waste? Note, Before we allow
ourselves to be merry, we ought to consider whether we should be merry
or no. Should we make mirth, we who are sentenced to the sword, who lie
under the wrath and curse of God? Shall we make mirth as other people,
who have gone a whoring from our God? [Hos
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#001.md). Should we now make mirth, when
the hand of God has gone out against us, when God's judgments are abroad
in the land and he by them calls to weeping and mourning? [Isa
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#011.md), [Isa
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#013.md). Shall we now make mirth as the
king and Haman, when the church is in perplexity ([Est
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#015).md), when we should be grieving for
the affliction of Joseph? [Amo 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#006.md).

[Ezekiel 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 21:18</span></span>

The prophet, in the verses before, had shown them the sword coming; he
here shows them that sword coming against them, that they might not
flatter themselves that by some means or other it should be diverted a
contrary way.

I. He must see and show the Chaldean army coming against Jerusalem and
determined by a supreme power so to do. The prophet must appoint him two
ways, that is, he must upon a paper draw out two roads ([Eze
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#019).md), as sometimes is done in maps;
and he must bring the king of Babylon's army to the place where the
roads part, for there they will make a stand. They both come out of the
same land; but when they come to the place where one road leads to
Rabbath, the head city of the Ammonites, and the other to Jerusalem, he
makes a pause; for, though he is resolved to be the ruin of both, yet he
is not determined which to attack first; here his politics and his
politicians leave him at a loss. The sword must go either to Rabbath or
to Judah in Jerusalem. Many of the inhabitants of Judah had now taken
shelter in Jerusalem, and all the interests of the country were bound up
in the safety of the city, and therefore it is called Judah in Jerusalem
the defenced; so strongly fortified was it, both by nature and art, that
it was thought impregnable, [Lam 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#012.md).
The prophet must describe this dilemma that the king of Babylon is at
([Eze 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#021).md); for the king of Babylon
stood (that is, he shall stand considering what course to take) at the
head of the two ways. Though he was a prince of great foresight and
great resolution, yet, it seems, he knew neither his own interest nor
his own mind. Let not the wise man then glory in his wisdom nor the
mighty man in his arbitrary power, for even those that may do what they
will seldom know what to do for the best. Now observe, 1. The method he
took to come to a resolution; he used divination, applied to a higher
and invisible power, perhaps to the determination of Providence by a
lot, in order to which he made his arrows bright, that were to be drawn
for the lots, in honour of the solemnity. Perhaps Jerusalem was written
on one arrow and Rabbath on the other, and that which was first drawn
out of the quiver he determined to attack first. Or he applied to the
direction of some pretended oracle: he consulted with images or
teraphim, expecting to receive audible answers from them. Or to the
observations which the augurs made upon the entrails of the sacrifices:
he looked in the liver, whether the position of that portended good or
ill luck. Note, It is a mortification to the pride of the wise men of
the earth that in difficult cases they have been glad to make their
court to heaven for direction; as it is an instance of their folly that
they have taken such ridiculous ways of doing it, when in cases proper
for an appeal to Providence it is sufficient that the lot be cast into
the lap, with that prayer, Give a perfect lot, and a firm belief that
the disposal thereof is not fortuitous, but of the Lord, [Pro
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#033.md). 2. The resolution he was hereby
brought to. Even by these sinful practices God served his own purposes
and directed him to go to Jerusalem, [Eze
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#022.md). The divination for Jerusalem
happened to be at his right hand, which, according to the rules of
divination, determined him that way. Note, What services God designs men
for he will be sure in his providence to lead them to, though perhaps
they themselves are not aware what guidance they are under. Well,
Jerusalem being the mark set up, the campaign is presently opened with
the siege of that important place. Captains are appointed for the
command of the forces to be employed in the siege, who must open the
mouth in the slaughter, must give directions to the soldiers what to do
and make speeches to animate them. Orders are given to provide every
thing necessary for carrying on the siege with vigour; battering rams
must be prepared and forts built. O what pains, what cost, are men at to
destroy one another!

II\. He must show both the people and the prince that they bring this
destruction upon themselves by their own sin.

1\. The people do so, [Eze 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#023.md), [Eze
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#024.md). They slight the notices that
are given them of the judgment coming. Ezekiel's prophecy is to them a
false divination; they are not moved or awakened to repentance by it.
When they hear that Nebuchadnezzar by his divination is directed to
Jerusalem, and assured of success in that enterprise, they laugh at it
and continue secure, calling it a false divination; because they have
sworn oaths, that is, they have joined in a solemn league with the
Egyptians, and they depend upon the promise they have made them to raise
the siege, or upon the assurances which the false prophets have given
them that it shall be raised. Or it may refer to the oaths of allegiance
they had sworn to the king of Babylon, but had violated, for which
treachery of theirs God had given them up to a judicial blindness, so
that the fairest warnings given them were slighted by them as false
divinations. Note, It is not strange if those who make a jest of the
most sacred oaths can make a jest likewise of the most sacred oracles;
for where will a profane mind stop? But shall their unbelief invalidate
the counsel of God? Are they safe because they are secure? By no means;
nay, the contempt they put upon divine warnings is a sin that brings to
remembrance their other sins, and they may thank themselves if they be
now remembered against them. (1.) Their present wickedness is
discovered. Now that God is contending with them so perverse and
obstinate are they that whatever they offer in their own defence does
but add to their offence; they never conducted themselves so ill as they
did now that they had the loudest call given them to repent and reform:
"So that in all your doings your sins do appear. Turn yourselves which
way you will, you show a black side." This is too true of every one of
us; for not only there is none that lives and sins not, but there is not
a must man upon earth that does good and sins not. Our best services
have such allays of weakness, and folly, and imperfection, and so much
evil is present with us even when we would do good, that we may say,
with sorrow and shame, In all our doings, and in all our sayings too,
our sins do appear, and witness against us, so that if we were under the
law we were undone. (2.) This brings to mind their former wickedness:
"You have made your iniquity to be remembered, not by yourselves that it
might be repented of, but by the justice of God that it might be
reckoned for. Your own sins make the sins of your fathers to be
remembered against you, which otherwise you should never have smarted
for." Note, God remembers former iniquities against those only who by
the present discoveries of their wickedness show that they do not repent
of them. (3.) That they may suffer for all together, they are turned
over to the destroyed, that they may be taken (v. 23): "You shall be
taken with the hand that God had appointed to seize you and to hold you
and out of which you cannot escape." Men are said to be God's hand when
they are made use of as the ministers of his justice, [Psa
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md). Note, Those who will not be
taken with the word of God's grace shall at last be taken by the hand of
his wrath.

2\. The prince likewise brings his ruin upon himself. Zedekiah is the
prince of Israel, to whom the prophet here, in God's name, addresses
himself; and, if he had not spoken in God's name, he would not have
spoken so boldly, so bluntly; for is it fit to say to a king, Thou art
wicked? (1.) He gives him his character, [Eze
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#025.md). Thou profane and wicked prince
of Israel! He was not so bad as some of his predecessors, and yet bad
enough to merit his character. He was himself profane, lost to every
thing that is virtuous and sacred. And he was wicked, as he promoted sin
among his people; he sinned, and made Israel to sin. Note, Profaneness
and wickedness are bad in any, but worst of all in a prince, a prince of
Israel, who as an Israelite should know better himself, and as a prince
should set a better example and have a better influence on those about
him. (2.) He reads him his doom. His iniquity has an end; the measure of
it is full, and therefore his day has come, the day of his punishment,
the day of divine vengeance. Note, Though those who are wicked and
profane may flourish awhile, yet their day will come to fall. The
sentence here passed is, \[1.\] That Zedekiah shall be deposed. He has
forfeited his crown, and he shall no longer wear it; he has by his
profaneness profaned his crown, and it shall be cast to the ground ([Eze
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#026).md): Remove the diadem. Crowns and
diadems are losable things; it is only in the other world that there is
a crown of glory that fades not away, a kingdom that cannot be moved.
The Chaldee paraphrase expounds it thus: Take away the diadem from
Seraiah the chief priest, and I will take away the crown from Zedekiah
the king; neither this nor that shall abide in his place, but shall be
removed. This shall not be the same, not the same that he has been; this
not this (so the word is); profane and wicked perhaps he is as he has
been. Note, Men lose their dignity by their iniquity. Their profaneness
and wickedness remove their diadem, and take off their crown, and make
them the reverse of what they were. \[2.\] That great confusion and
disorder in the state shall follow hereupon. Every thing shall be turned
upside down. The conqueror shall take a pride in exalting him that is
low and abasing him that is high, preferring some and degrading others,
at his pleasure, without any regard either to right or merit. \[3.\]
Attempts to re-establish the government shall be blasted and come to
nothing, Gedaliah's particularly, and Ishmael's who was of the
seed-royal (to which the Chaldee paraphrase refers this); neither of
them shall be able to make any thing of it. I will overturn, overturn,
overturn, first one project and then another; for who can build up what
God will throw down? \[4.\] This monarchy shall never be restored till
it is fixed for perpetuity in the hands of the Messiah. There shall be
no more kings of the house of David after Zedekiah, till Christ comes,
whose right the kingdom is, who is that seed of David in whom the
promise was to have its full accomplishment, and I will give it to him.
He shall have the throne of his father David, [Luk
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032.md). Immediately before the coming of
Christ there was a long eclipse of the royal dignity, as there was also
a failing of the spirit of prophecy, that his shining forth in the
fulness of time both as king and prophet might appear the more
illustrious. Note, Christ has an incontestable title to the dominion and
sovereignty both in the church and in the world; the kingdom is his
right. And, having the right, he shall in due time have the possession:
I will give it to him; and there shall be a general overturning of all
rather than he shall come short of his right, and a certain overturning
of all the opposition that stands in his way to make room for him, [Dan
2:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#045.md); [Co1
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#025.md). This is mentioned here for the
comfort of those who feared that the promise made in David would fail
for evermore. "No," says God, "that promise is sure, for the Messiah's
kingdom shall last for ever."

[Ezekiel 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 21:28</span></span>

The prediction of the destruction of the Ammonites, which was effected
by Nebuchadnezzar about five years after the destruction of Jerusalem,
seems to come in here upon occasion of the king of Babylon's diverting
his design against Rabbath, when he turned it upon Jerusalem. Upon this
the Ammonites grew very insolent, and triumphed over Jerusalem; but the
prophet must let them know that forbearance is no acquittance; the
reprieve is not a pardon; their day also is at hand; their turn comes
next, and it will be but a poor satisfaction to them that they are to be
devoured last, to be last executed.

I. The sin of the Ammonites is here intimated; it is their reproach,
[Eze 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#028.md). 1. The reproach they put
upon themselves when they hearkened to their false prophets (for such it
seems there were among them as well as among the Jews), who pretended to
foretel their perpetual safety in the midst of the desolations that were
made of the countries round about them: "They see vanity unto thee and
divine a lie, [Eze 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#029.md). They flatter
thee with promises of peace, and thou art such a fool as to suffer
thyself to be imposed upon by them and to encourage them therein by
giving credit to them." Note, Those that feed themselves with a
self-conceit in the day of their prosperity prepare matter for a
self-reproach in the day of their calamity. 2. The reproach they put
upon the Israel of God, when they triumphed in their afflictions, and
thereby added affliction to them, which was very barbarous and inhuman.
Their divines, by puffing them up with a conceit that they were a better
people than Israel, being spared when they were cut off, and with a
confidence that their prosperity should always continue, made them so
very haughty and insolent that they did even tread on the necks of the
Israelites that were slain, slain by the wicked Chaldeans, who had
commission to execute God's judgments upon them when their iniquity had
an end, that is, when the measure of it was full. We shall meet with
this again, [Eze 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#003.md), etc. Note,
Those are ripening apace for misery who trample upon the people of God
in their distress, whereas they ought to tremble when judgment begins at
the house of God.

II\. The utter destruction of the Ammonites is threatened. For the
reproach cast on the church by her neighbours will be returned into
their own bosom, [Psa 79:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#012.md). Let us
see how terrible the threatening is and the destruction will be. 1. It
shall come from the wrath of God, who resents the indignities and
injuries done to his people as done to himself ([Eze
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#031).md): I will pour out my indignation
as a shower of fire and brimstone upon thee. The least drop of divine
indignation and wrath will create tribulation and anguish enough to the
soul of man that does evil; what then would a full stream of that
indignation and wrath do? "I will blow against thee in the fire of my
wrath; that is, I will blow up the fire of my wrath against thee; it
shall burn with the utmost vehemence." Thou shalt be for fuel to this
fire, [Eze 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#032.md). Note, Wicked men
make themselves fuel to the fire of God's wrath; they are consumed by
it, and it is inflamed by them. 2. It shall be effected by the sword of
war; to them he must cry, as before to Israel, because they had
triumphed in Israel's overthrow: The sword, the sword is drawn ([Eze
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#028.md), compare [Eze
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#009.md), [Eze
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#010).md); it is drawn to consume because
of the glittering, because it is brandished and glitters, and is fit to
be made use of. God's executions will answer his preparations. This
sword, when it is drawn, shall not return into its sheath ([Eze
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#030).md) till it has done the work for
which it was drawn. When the sword is drawn it does not return till God
causes it to return, and he is in one mind and who can turn him? Who can
change his purpose? 3. The persons employed in it are brutish men, and
skilful to destroy. Men of such a bad character as this, who have the
wit of men to do the work of wild beasts - human reason, which makes
them skilful, but no human compassion, which makes them skilful only to
destroy - though they are the scandal of mankind, yet sometimes are made
use of to serve God's purposes. God delivers the Ammonites into the
hands of such, and justly, for they themselves were brutish, and
delighted in the destruction of God's Israel. We have reason to pray, as
Paul desired to be prayed for, that we may be delivered from wicked and
unreasonable men ([Th2 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#002).md), men that
seem made for doing mischief. 4. The place where they should thus be
reckoned with: "I will judge thee where thou wast created, where thou
wast first formed into a people, and where thou hast been settled ever
since, and therefore where thou seemest to have taken root; the land of
thy nativity shall be the land of thy destruction." Note, God can bring
ruin upon us even where we are most secure, and turn us out of that land
which we thought we had a title to not to be disputed and a possession
of not to be disturbed. Thy blood shall be shed not only in thy borders,
but in the midst of thy land. Lastly, I shall be an irreparable ruin:
"Though thou mayest think to recover thyself, it is in vain to think of
it; thou shalt be no more remembered with any respect," [Psa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#006.md). Justly is their name blotted out
who would have Israel's name for ever lost.
