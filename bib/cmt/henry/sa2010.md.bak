### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 10:0</span></span>

This chapter gives us an account of a war David has with the Ammonites
and the Syrians their allies, with the occasion and success of it. I.
David sent a friendly embassy to Hanun king of the Ammonites ([Sa2
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#001.md), [Sa2
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#002).md). II. He, upon a base surmise
that it was ill intended, abused David's ambassadors ([Sa2
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#003.md), [Sa2
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#004).md). III. David resenting it ([Sa2
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#005).md), and the Ammonites prepared for
war against him ([Sa2 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#006).md). IV. David
carried the war into their country, sent against them. Joab and Abishai,
who addressed themselves to the battle with a great deal of conduct and
bravery ([Sa2 10:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#007).md). V. The
Ammonites, and the Syrians their allies, were totally routed ([Sa2
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#013.md), [Sa2
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#014).md). VI. The forces of the Syrians,
which rallied again, were a second time defeated ([Sa2
10:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#015).md). Thus did David advance his
own reputation for gratitude, in returning kindness, and for justice, in
repaying injuries.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 10:1</span></span>

Here is, I. The great respect David paid to his neighbour, the king of
the Ammonites, [Sa2 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#001.md), [Sa2
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#002.md). 1. The inducement to it was some
kindness he had formerly received from Nahash the deceased king. He
showed kindness to me, says David ([Sa2
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#002).md), and therefore (having lately
had satisfaction in showing kindness to Mephibosheth for his father's
sake) he resolves to show kindness to his son, and to keep up a friendly
correspondence with him. Thus the pleasure of doing one kind and
generous action should excite us to another. Nahash had been an enemy to
Israel, a cruel enemy ([Sa1 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#002).md), and
yet had shown kindness to David, perhaps only in contradiction to Saul,
who was unkind to him: however, if David receives kindness, he is not
nice in examining the grounds and principles of it, but resolves
gratefully to return it. If a Pharisee give alms in pride, though God
will not reward him, yet he that receives the alms ought to return
thanks for it. God knows the heart, but we do not. 2. The particular
instance of respect was sending an embassy to condole with him on his
father's death, as is common among princes in alliance with each other:
David sent to comfort him. Note, It is a comfort to children, when their
parents are dead, to find that their parents' friends are theirs, and
that they intend to keep up an acquaintance with them. It is a comfort
to mourners to find that there are those who mourn with them, are
sensible of their loss and share with them in it. It is a comfort to
those who are honouring the memory of their deceased relations to find
there are others who likewise honour it and who had a value for those
whom they valued.

II\. The great affront which Hanun the king of the Ammonites put upon
David in his ambassadors. 1. He hearkened to the spiteful suggestions of
his princes, who insinuated that David's ambassadors, under pretence of
being comforters, were sent as spies, [Sa2
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#003.md). False men are ready to think
others as false as themselves; and those that bear ill-will to their
neighbours are resolved not to believe that their neighbours bear any
good-will to them. They would not thus have imagined that David
dissembled but that they were conscious to themselves that they could
have dissembled, to serve a turn. Unfounded suspicion argues a wicked
mind. Bishop Patrick's note on this is that "there is nothing so well
meant but it may be ill interpreted, and is wont to be so by men who
love nobody but themselves." Men of the greatest honour and virtue must
not think it strange if they be thus misrepresented. Charity thinketh no
evil. 2. Entertaining this vile suggestion, he basely abused David's
ambassadors, like a man of a sordid villainous spirit, that was fitter
to rake a kennel than to wear a crown. If he had any reason to suspect
that David's messengers came on a bad design, he would have done
prudently enough to be upon the reserve with them, and to dismiss them
as soon as he could; but it is plain he only sought an occasion to put
the utmost disgrace he could upon them, out of an antipathy to their
king and their country. They were themselves men of honour, and much
more so as they represented the prince that sent them; they and their
reputation were under the special protection of the law of nations; they
put a confidence in the Ammonites, and came among them unarmed; yet
Hanun used them like rogues and vagabonds, and worse, shaved off the one
half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the midst, to expose
them to the contempt and ridicule of his servants, that they might make
sport with them and that these men might seem vile.

III\. David's tender concern for his servants that were thus abused. He
sent to meet them, and to let them know how much he interested himself
in their quarrel and how soon he would avenge it, and directed them to
stay at Jericho, a private place, where they would not have occasion to
come into company, till that half of their beards which was shaved off
had grown to such a length that the other half might be decently cut to
it, [Sa2 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#005.md). The Jews wore their
beards long, reckoning it an honour to appear aged and grave; and
therefore it was not fit that persons of their rank and figure should
appear at court unlike their neighbours. Change of raiment, it is
likely, they had with them, to put on, instead of that which was cut
off; but the loss of their beards would not be so soon repaired; yet in
time these would grow again, and all would be well. Let us learn not to
lay too much to heart unjust reproaches; after awhile they will wear off
of themselves, and turn only to the shame of their authors, while the
injured reputation in a little time grows again, as these beards did.
God will bring forth thy righteousness as the light, therefore wait
patiently for him, [Psa 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#006.md), [Psa
37:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#007.md).

Some have thought that David, in the indignity he received from the king
of Ammon, was but well enough served for courting and complimenting that
pagan prince, whom he knew to be an inveterate enemy to Israel, and
might now remember how, when he would have put out the right eyes of the
men of Jabesh-Gilead, he designed that, as he did this, for a reproach
upon all Israel, 1 Sam. [Psa 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#002.md).
What better usage could he expect from such a spiteful family and
people? Why should he covet the friendship of a people whom Israel must
have so little to do with as that an Ammonite might not enter into the
congregation of the Lord, even to the tenth generation? [Deu
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 10:6</span></span>

Here we have, I. The preparation which the Ammonites made for war, [Sa2
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#006.md). They saw they had made
themselves very odious to David and obnoxious to his just displeasure.
This they might easily have foreseen when they abused his ambassadors,
which was no other than a challenge to war, and a bold defiance of him.
Yet, it seems, they had not considered how unable they were, with their
thousands, to meet his; for now they found themselves an unequal match,
and were forced to hire forces of other nations into their service. Thus
sinners daringly provoke God, and expose themselves to his wrath, and
never consider that he is stronger than they, [Co1
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#022.md). The Ammonites gave the affront
first, and they were the first that raised forces to justify it. Had
they humbled themselves, and begged David's pardon, probably an honorary
satisfaction might have atoned for the offence. But, when they were thus
desperately resolved to stand by what they had done, they courted their
own ruin.

II\. The speedy descent which David's forces made upon them, [Sa2
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#007.md). When David heard of their
military preparations, he sent Joab with a great army to attack them,
[Sa2 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#007.md). Those that are at war with
the Son of David not only give the provocation, but begin the war; for
he waits to be gracious, but they strengthen themselves against him, and
therefore, if they turn not, he will whet his sword, [Psa
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#012.md). God has forces to send against
those that set his wrath at defiance ([Isa
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019).md), which will convince them, when
it is too late, that none ever hardened his heart against God and
prospered. It was David's prudence to carry the war into their country,
and fight them at the entering in of the gate of their capital city,
Rabbah, as some think, or Medeba, a city in their borders, before which
they pitched to guard their coast, [Ch1
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#007.md). Such are the terrors and
desolations of war that every good prince will, in love to his people,
keep it as much as may be at a distance from them.

III\. Preparations made on both sides for an engagement. 1. The enemy
disposed themselves into two bodies, one of Ammonites, which, being
their own, were posted at the gate of the city; the other of Syrians,
whom they had taken into their pay, and who were therefore posted at a
distance in the field, to charge the forces of Israel in the flank or
rear, while the Ammonites charged them in the front, [Sa2
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#008.md). 2. Joab, like a wise general,
was soon aware of the design, and accordingly divided his forces: the
choicest men he took under his own command, to fight the Syrians, whom
probably he knew to be the better soldiers, and, being hired men, better
versed in the arts of war, [Sa2 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#009.md).
The rest of the forces he put under the command of Abishai his brother,
to engage the Ammonites, [Sa2 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#010.md).
It should seem, Joab found the enemy so well prepared to receive them
that his conduct and courage were never so tried as now.

IV\. Joab's speech before the battle, [Sa2
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#011.md), [Sa2
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#012.md). It is not long, but pertinent,
and brave. 1. He prudently concerts the matter with Abishai his brother,
that the dividing of the forces might not be the weakening of them, but
that, which part soever was borne hard upon, the other should come in to
its assistance. He supposes the worst, that one of them should be
obliged to give back; and in that case, upon a signal given, the other
should send a detachment to relieve it. Note, Mutual helpfulness is
brotherly duty. If occasion be, thou shalt help me, and I will help
thee. Christ's soldiers should thus strengthen one another's hands in
their spiritual warfare. The strong must succour and help the weak.
Those that through grace are conquerors over temptation must counsel,
and comfort, and pray for, those that are tempted. When thou art
converted, strengthen thy brethren, [Luk
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032.md). The members of the natural body
help one another, [Co1 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#021.md). 2. He
bravely encourages himself, and his brother, and the rest of the
officers and soldiers, to do their utmost. Great dangers put an edge
upon true courage. When Joab saw the front of the battle was against
him, both before and behind, instead of giving orders to make an
honourable retreat, he animated his men to charge so much more
furiously: Be of good courage and let us play the men, not for pay and
preferment, for honour and fame, but for our people, and for the cities
of our God, for the public safety and welfare, in which the glory of God
is so much interested. God and our country was the word. "Let us be
valiant, from a principle of love to Israel, that are our people,
descended from the same stock, for whom we are employed, and in whose
peace we shall have peace; and from a principle of love to God, for they
are his cities that we are fighting in the defence of." The relation
which any person or thing stands in to God should endear it to us, and
engage us to do our utmost in its service. 3. He piously leaves the
issue with God: "When we have done our part, according to the duty of
our place, let the Lord do that which seemeth to him good." Let nothing
be wanting in us, whatever the success be; let God's work be done by us,
and then God's will be done concerning us. When we make conscience of
doing our duty we may, with the greatest satisfaction, leave the event
with God, not thinking that our valour binds him to prosper us, but that
still he may do as he pleases, yet hoping for his salvation in his own
way and time.

V. The victory Joab obtained over the confederate forces of Syria and
Ammon, [Sa2 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#013.md), [Sa2
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#014.md). He provided for the worst, and
put the case that the Syrians and Ammonites might prove too strong for
him ([Sa2 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#011).md), but he proved too
strong for them both. We do not hinder our success by preparing for
disappointment. The Syrians were first routed by Joab, and then the
Ammonites by Abishai; the Ammonites seem not to have fought at all, but,
upon the retreat of the Syrians, to have fled into the city. It is a
temptation to soldiers to fly when they have a city at their backs to
fly to. It is one thing when men may either fight or fly and another
thing when they must either fight or die.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa2 10:15</span></span>

Here is, 1. A new attempt of the Syrians to recover their lost honour
and to check the progress of David's victorious arms. The forces that
were lately dispersed rallied again, and gathered themselves together,
[Sa2 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#015.md). Even the baffled cause
will make head as long as there is any life in it; the enemies of the
Son of David do so, Matt, [Sa2 22:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#034.md);
[Rev 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#019.md). These, being conscious of
their insufficiency, called in the aid of their allies and dependencies
on the other side of the river ([Sa2
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#016).md), and, being thus recruited,
they hoped to make their part good against Israel, but they knew not the
thoughts of the Lord, for he gathered them as sheaves into the floor;
see [Mic 4:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011.md). 2. The defeat of
this attempt by the vigilance and valour of David, who, upon notice of
their design, resolved not to stay till they attacked him, but went in
person at the head of his army over Jordan ([Sa2
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#017).md), and, in a pitched battle,
routed the Syrians ([Sa2 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#018).md), slew
7000 men, who belonged to 700 chariots, and 40,000 other soldiers, horse
and foot, as appears by comparing [Ch1
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#018.md). Their general was killed in the
battle, and David came home in triumph, no doubt. 3. The consequence of
this victory over the Syrians. (1.) David gained several tributaries,
[Sa2 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#019.md). The kings, or petty
princes, that had been subject to Hadarezer, when they saw how powerful
David was, very wisely made peace with Israel, whom they found they
could not make war with, and served them, since they were able to give
them protection. Thus the promise made to Abraham ([Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018).md), and repeated to Joshua ([Jos
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#004).md), that the borders of Israel
should extend to the river Euphrates, was performed, at length. (2.) The
Ammonites lost their old allies: The Syrians feared to help the children
of Ammon, not because they had an unrighteous cause (justifying a crime
which was a breach of the law of nations), but because they found it was
an unsuccessful cause. It is dangerous helping those that have God
against them; for, when they fall, their helpers will fall with them.

Jesus Christ, the Son of David, sent his ambassadors, his apostles and
ministers, after all his servants the prophets, to the Jewish church and
nation; but they treated them shamefully, as Hanun did David's
ambassadors, mocked them, abused them, slew them; and it was this that
filled the measure of their iniquity, and brought upon them ruin without
remedy ([Mat 21:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#035.md), [Mat
21:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#041.md), [Mat
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#007.md); compare [Ch2
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016).md); for Christ takes the affronts
and injuries done to his ministers as done to himself and will avenge
them accordingly.
