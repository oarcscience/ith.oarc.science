### [Psalms Chapter 83](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 83:0</span></span>

This psalm is the last of those that go under the name of Asaph. It is
penned, as most of those, upon a public account, with reference to the
insults of the church's enemies, who sought its ruin. Some think it was
penned upon occasion of the threatening descent which was made upon the
land of Judah in Jehoshaphat's time by the Moabites and Ammonites, those
children of Lot here spoken of ([Psa
83:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#008).md), who were at the head of the
alliance and to whom all the other states here mentioned were
auxiliaries. We have the story [Ch2
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001.md), where it is said, The children
of Moab and Ammon, and others besides them, invaded the land. Others
think it was penned with reference to all the confederacies of the
neighbouring nations against Israel, from first to last. The psalmist
here makes an appeal and application, I. To God's knowledge, by a
representation of their designs and endeavours to destroy Israel ([Psa
83:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#001).md). II. To God's justice and
jealousy, both for his church and for his own honour, by an earnest
prayer for the defeat of their attempt, that the church might be
preserved, the enemies humbled, and God glorified ([Psa
83:9-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#009).md). This, in the singing of it,
we may apply to the enemies of the gospel-church, all anti-christian
powers and factions, representing to God their confederacies against
Christ and his kingdom, and rejoicing in the hope that all their
projects will be baffled and the gates of hell shall not prevail against
the church.

A song or psalm of Asaph.

[Psalms 83:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 83:1</span></span>

The Israel of God were now in danger, and fear, and great distress, and
yet their prayer is called, A song or psalm; for singing psalms is not
unseasonable, no, not when the harps are hung upon the willow-trees.

I. The psalmist here begs of God to appear on the behalf of his injured
threatened people ([Psa 83:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#001).md): "Keep
not thou silence, O God! but give judgment for us against those that do
us an apparent wrong." Thus Jehoshaphat prayed upon occasion of that
invasion ([Ch2 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#011).md), Behold, how
they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession. Sometimes God
seems to connive at the unjust treatment which is given to his people;
he keeps silence, as one that either did not observe it or did not
concern himself in it; he holds his peace, as if he would observe an
exact neutrality, and let them fight it out; he is still, and gives not
the enemies of his people any disturbance or opposition, but seems to
sit by as a man astonished, or as a mighty man that cannot save. Then he
gives us leave to call upon him, as here, "Keep not thou silence, O God!
Lord, speak to us by the prophets for our encouragement against our
fears" (as he did in reference to that invasion, [Ch2
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#014), etc..md); "Lord, speak for us by
the providence and speak against our enemies; speak deliverance to us
and disappointment to them." God's speaking is his acting; for with him
saying and doing are the same thing.

II\. He here gives an account of the grand alliance of the neighbouring
nations against Israel, which he begs of God to break, and blast the
projects of. Now observe here,

1\. Against whom this confederacy is formed; it is against the Israel of
God, and so, in effect, against the God of Israel. Thus the psalmist
takes care to interest God in their cause, not doubting but that, if it
appeared that they were for God, God would make it to appear that he was
for them, and then they might set all their enemies at defiance; for
whom then could be against them? "Lord," says he, "they are thy enemies,
and they hate thee." All wicked people are God's enemies (the carnal
mind is enmity against God), but especially wicked persecutors; they
hated the religious worshippers of God, because they hated God's holy
religion and the worship of him. This was that which made God's people
so zealous against them - that they fought against God: They are
confederate against thee, [Psa 83:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#005.md).
Were our interest only concerned, we could the better bear it; but, when
God himself is struck at, it is time to cry, Help, Lord. Keep not thou
silence, O God! He proves that they are confederate against God, for
they are so against the people of God, who are near and dear to him, his
son, his first-born, his portion, and the lot of his inheritance; he may
truly be said to fight against me that endeavours to destroy my
children, to root out my family, and to ruin my estate. "Lord," says the
psalmist, "they are thy enemies, for they consult against thy hidden
ones." Note, God's people are his hidden ones, hidden, (1.) In respect
of secresy. Their life is hid with Christ in God; the world knows them
not; if they knew them, they would not hate them as they do. (2.) In
respect of safety. God takes them under his special protection, hides
them in the hollow of his hand; and yet, in defiance of God and his
power and promise to secure his people, they will consult to ruin them
and cast them down from their excellency ([Psa
62:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#004).md), and to make a prey of those
whom the Lord has set apart for himself, [Psa
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003.md). They resolve to destroy those
whom God resolves to preserve.

2\. How this confederacy is managed. The devil is at the bottom of it,
and therefore it is carried on, (1.) With a great deal of heat and
violence: Thy enemies make a tumult, [Psa
83:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#002.md). The heathen rage, [Psa
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md). The nations are angry, [Rev
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#018.md). They are noisy in their
clamours against the people whom they hope to run down with their loud
calumnies. This comes in as a reason why God should not keep silence:
"The enemies talk big and talk much; Lord, let them not talk all, but do
thou speak to them in thy wrath," [Psa
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005). (2..md) With a great deal of pride
and insolence: They have lifted up the head. In confidence of their
success, they are so elevated as if they could over-top the Most High
and overpower the Almighty. (3.) With a great deal of art and policy:
They have taken crafty counsel, [Psa
83:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#003.md). The subtlety of the old serpent
appears in their management, and they contrive by all possible means,
though ever so base, ever so bad, to gain their point. They areprofound
to make slaughter ([Hos 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#002).md), as if
they could outwit Infinite Wisdom. (4.) With a great deal of unanimity.
Whatever separate clashing interest they have among themselves, against
the people of God they consult with one consent ([Psa
83:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#005).md), nor is Satan's kingdom divided
against itself. To push on this unholy war, they lay their heads
together, and their horns, and their hearts too. Fas est et ab hoste
doceri - Even an enemy may instruct. Do the enemies of the church act
with one consent to destroy it? Are the kings of the earth of one mind
to give their power and honour to the beast? And shall not the church's
friends be unanimous in serving her interests? If Herod and Pilate are
made friends, that they may join in crucifying Christ, surely Paul and
Barnabas, Paul and Peter, will soon be made friends, that they may join
in preaching Christ.

3\. What it is that is aimed at in this confederacy. They consult not
like the Gibeonites to make a league with Israel, that they might
strengthen themselves by such a desirable alliance, which would have
been their wisdom. They consult, not only to clip the wings of Israel,
to recover their new conquests, and check the progress of their
victorious arms, not only to keep the balance even between them and
Israel, and to prevent their power from growing exorbitant; this will
not serve. It is no less than the utter ruin and extirpation of Israel
that they design ([Psa 83:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#004).md): "Come,
let us cut them off from being a nation, as they cut off the seven
nations of Canaan; let us leave them neither root nor branch, but lay
their country so perfectly waste that the name of Israel may be no more
in remembrance, no, not in history;" for with them they would destroy
their Bibles and burn all their records. Such is the enmity of the
serpent's seed against the seed of the woman. It is the secret wish of
many wicked men that the church of God might not have a being in the
world, that there might be no such thing as religion among mankind.
Having banished the sense of it out of their own hearts, they would
gladly see the whole earth as well rid of it, all its laws and
ordinances abolished, all its restraints and obligations shaken off, and
all that preach, profess, or practise it cut off. This they would bring
it to if it were in their power; but he that sits in heaven shall laugh
at them.

4\. Who they are that are drawn into this confederacy. The nations that
entered into this alliance are here mentioned ([Psa
83:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#006).md); the Edomites and Ishmaelites,
both descendants from Abraham, lead the van; for apostates from the
church have been its most bitter and spiteful enemies, witness Julian.
These were allied to Israel in blood and yet in alliance against Israel.
There are no bonds of nature so strong but the spirit of persecution has
broken through them. The brother shall betray the brother to death. Moab
and Ammon were the children of righteous Lot; but, as an incestuous, so
a degenerate race. The Philistines were long a thorn in Israel's side,
and very vexatious. How the inhabitants of Tyre, who in David's time
were Israel's firm allies, come in among their enemies, I know not; but
that Assur (that is, the Assyrian) also is joined with them is not
strange, or that (as the word is) they were an arm to the children of
Lot. See how numerous the enemies of God's church have always been.
Lord, how are those increased that trouble it! God's heritage was as a
speckled bird; all the birds round about were against her ([Jer
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#009).md), which highly magnifies the
power of God in preserving to himself a church in the world, in spite of
the combined force of earth and hell.

[Psalms 83:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 83:9</span></span>

The psalmist here, in the name of the church, prays for the destruction
of those confederate forces, and, in God's name, foretels it; for this
prayer that it might be so amounts to a prophecy that it shall be so,
and this prophecy reaches to all the enemies of the gospel-church;
whoever they be that oppose the kingdom of Christ, here they may read
their doom. The prayer is, in short, that these enemies, who were
confederate against Israel, might be defeated in all their attempts, and
that they might prove their own ruin, and so God's Israel might be
preserved and perpetuated. Now this is here illustrated,

I. By some precedents. Let that be their punishment which has been the
fate of others who have formerly set themselves against God's Israel.
The defeat and discomfiture of former combinations may be pleaded in
prayer to God and improved for the encouragement of our own faith and
hope, because God is the same still that ever he was, the same to his
people and the same against his and their enemies; with him is no
variableness. 1. He prays that their armies might be destroyed as the
armies of former enemies had been ([Psa
83:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#009.md), [Psa
83:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#010).md): Do to them as to the
Midianites; let them be routed by their own fears, for so the Midianites
were, more than by Gideon's 300 men. Do to them as to the army under the
command of Sisera (who was general under Jabin king of Canaan) which God
discomfited ([Jdg 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#015).md) at the brook
Kishon, near to which was Endor. They became as dung on the earth; their
dead bodies were thrown like dung laid in heaps, or spread, to fatten
the ground; they were trodden to dirt by Barak's small but victorious
army; and this was fitly made a precedent here, because Deborah made it
so to aftertimes when it was fresh. [Jdg
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#031.md), So let all thy enemies perish, O
Lord! that is, So they shall perish. 2. He prays that their leaders
might be destroyed as they had been formerly. The common people would
not have been so mischievous if their princes had not set them on, and
therefore they are particularly prayed against, [Psa
83:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#011.md), [Psa
83:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#012). Observe, (1..md) What their malice
was against the Israel of God. They said, Let us take to ourselves the
houses of God in possession ([Psa
83:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#012).md), the pleasant places of God (so
the word is), by which we may understand the land of Canaan, which was a
pleasant land and was Immanuel's land, or the temple, which was indeed
God's pleasant place ([Isa 64:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#011).md), or
(as Dr. Hammond suggests) the pleasant pastures, which these Arabians,
who traded in cattle, did in a particular manner seek after. The princes
and nobles aimed to enrich themselves by this war; and their armies must
be made as dung for the earth, to serve their covetousness and their
ambition. (2.) What their lot should be. They shall be made like Oreb
and Zeeb (two princes of the Midianites, who, when their forces were
routed, were taken in their flight by the Ephraimites and slain, [Jdg
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#025).md), and like Zeba and Zalmunna,
whom Gideon himself slew, [Jdg 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#021.md).
"Let these enemies of ours be made as easy a prey to us as they were to
the conquerors then." We may not prescribe to God, but we may pray to
God that he will deal with the enemies of his church in our days as he
did with those in the days of our fathers.

II\. He illustrates it by some similitudes, and prays, 1. That God would
make them like a wheel ([Psa 83:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#013).md),
that they might be in continual motion, unquiet, unsettled, and giddy in
all their counsels and resolves, that they might roll down easily and
speedily to their own ruin. Or, as some think, that they might be broken
by the judgments of God, as the corn is broken, or beaten out, by the
wheel which was then used in threshing. Thus, when a wise king scatters
the wicked, he is said to bring the wheel over them, [Pro
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#026.md). Those that trust in God have
their hearts fixed; those that fight against him are unfixed, like a
wheel. 2. That they might be chased as stubble, or chaff, before the
fierce wind. "The wheel, though it continually turn round, is fixed on
its own axis; but let them have no more fixation than the light stubble
has, which the wind hurries away, and nobody desires to save it, but is
willing it should go," [Psa 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004.md). Thus
shall the wicked be driven away in his wickedness, and chased out of the
world. 3. That they might be consumed, as wood by the fire, or as briers
and thorns, as fern or furze, upon the mountains, by the flames, [Psa
83:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#014.md). When the stubble is driven by
the wind it will rest, at last, under some hedge, in some ditch or
other; but he prays that they might not only be driven away as stubble,
but burnt up as stubble. And this will be the end of wicked men ([Heb
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#008).md) and particularly of all the
enemies of God's church. The application of these comparisons we have
([Psa 83:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#015).md): So persecute them with
thy tempest, persecute them to their utter ruin, and make them afraid
with thy storm. See how sinners are made miserable; the storm of God's
wrath raises terrors in their own hearts, and so they are made
completely miserable. God can deal with the proudest and most daring
sinner that has bidden defiance to his justice, and can make him afraid
as a grasshopper. It is the torment of devils that they tremble.

III\. He illustrates it by the good consequences of their confusion,
[Psa 83:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#016.md). He prays here that God,
having filled their hearts with terror, would thereby fill their faces
with shame, that they might be ashamed of their enmity to the people of
God ([Isa 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#011).md), ashamed of their
folly in acting both against Omnipotence itself and their own true
interest. They did what they could to put God's people to shame, but the
shame will at length return upon themselves. Now, 1. The beginning of
this shame might be a means of their conversion: "Let them be broken and
baffled in their attempts, that they may seek thy name, O Lord! Let them
be put to a stand, that they may have both leisure and reason to pause a
little, and consider who it is that they are fighting against and what
an unequal match they are for him, and may therefore humble and submit
themselves and desire conditions of peace. Let them be made to fear thy
name, and perhaps that will bring them to seek thy name." Note, That
which we should earnestly desire and beg of God for our enemies and
persecutors is that God would bring them to repentance, and we should
desire their abasement in order to this, no other confusion to them than
what may be a step towards their conversion. 2. If it did not prove a
means of their conversion, the perfecting of it would redound greatly to
the honour of God. If they will not be ashamed and repent, let them be
put to shame and perish; if they will not be troubled and turned, which
would soon put an end to all their trouble, a happy end, let them be
troubled for ever, and never have peace: this will be for God's glory
([Psa 83:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#018).md), that other men may know
and own, if they themselves will not, that thou, whose name alone is
JEHOVAH (that incommunicable, though not ineffable name) art the Most
High over all the earth. God's triumphs over his and his church's
enemies will be incontestable proofs, (1.) That he is, according to his
name JEHOVAH, a self-existent self-sufficient Being, that has all power
and perfection in himself. (2.) That he is the most high God, sovereign
Lord of all, above all gods, above all kings, above all that exalt
themselves and pretend to be high. (3.) That he is so, not only over the
land of Israel, but over all the earth, even those nations of the earth
that do not know him or own him; for his kingdom rules over all. These
are great and unquestionable truths, but men will hardly be persuaded to
know and believe them; therefore the psalmist prays that the destruction
of some might be the conviction of others. The final ruin of all God's
enemies, in the great day, will be the effectual proof of this, before
angels and men, when the everlasting shame and contempt to which sinners
shall rise ([Dan 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002).md) shall redound
to the everlasting honour and praise of that God to whom vengeance
belongs.
