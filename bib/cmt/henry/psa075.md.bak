### [Psalms Chapter 75](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 75:0</span></span>

Though this psalm is attributed to Asaph in the title, yet it does so
exactly agree with David's circumstances, at his coming to the crown
after the death of Saul, that most interpreters apply it to that
juncture, and suppose that either Asaph penned it, in the person of
David, as his poet-laureat (probably the substance of the psalm was some
speech which David made to a convention of the states, at his accession
to the government, and Asaph turned it into verse, and published it in a
poem, for the better spreading of it among the people), or that David
penned it, and delivered it to Asaph as precentor of the temple. In this
psalm, I. David returns God thanks for bringing him to the throne ([Psa
75:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001.md), [Psa
75:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#009).md). II. He promises to lay out
himself for the public good, in the use of the power God had given him
([Psa 75:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#002.md), [Psa
75:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#003.md), [Psa
75:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#010).md). III. He checks the insolence
of those that opposed his coming to the throne ([Psa
75:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#004.md), [Psa
75:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#005).md). IV. He fetches a reason for all
this from God's sovereign dominion in the affairs of the children of men
([Psa 75:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#006).md). In singing this psalm
we must give to God the glory of all the revolutions of states and
kingdoms, believing that they are all according to his counsel and that
he will make them all to work for the good of his church.

To the chief musician, Al-taschith. A psalm or song of Asaph.

[Psalms 75:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 75:1</span></span>

In these verses,

I. The psalmist gives to God the praise of his advancement to honour and
power, and the other great things he had done for him and for his people
Israel ([Psa 75:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001).md): Unto thee, O God!
do we give thanks for all the favours thou hast bestowed upon us; and
again, unto thee do we give thanks; for our thanksgivings must be often
repeated. Did not we often pray for mercy when we were in pursuit of it;
and shall we think it will suffice once or twice to give thanks when we
have obtained it? Not only I do give thanks, but we do, and I and all my
friends. If we share with others in their mercies, we must join with
them in their praises. "Unto thee, O God! the author of our mercies (and
we will not give that glory to the instruments which is due to thee
only), we give thanks; for that thy name is near (that the complete
accomplishment of thy promise made to David is not far off) thy wondrous
works, which thou hast already done for him, declare." Note, 1. There
are many works which God does for his people that may truly be called
wondrous works, out of the common course of providence and quite beyond
our expectation. 2. These wondrous works declare the nearness of his
name; they show that he himself is at hand, nigh to us in what we call
upon him for, and that he is about to do some great things for his
people, in pursuance of his purpose and promise. 3. When God's wondrous
works declare the nearness of his name it is our duty to give him
thanks, again and again to give him thanks.

II\. He lays himself under an obligation to use his power well, pursuant
to the great trust reposed in him ([Psa
75:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#002).md): When I shall receive the
congregation I will judge uprightly. Here he takes it for granted that
God would, in due time, perfect that which concerned him, that though
the congregation was very slow in gathering to him, and great opposition
was made to it, yet, at length, he should receive it; for what God has
spoken in his holiness he will perform by his wisdom and power. Being
thus in expectation of the mercy, he promises to make conscience of his
duty: "When I am a judge I will judge, and judge uprightly; not as those
that went before me, who either neglected judgment or, which was worse,
perverted it, either did no good with their power or did hurt." Note, 1.
Those that are advanced to posts of honour must remember they are posts
of service, and must set themselves with diligence and application of
mind to do the work to which they are called. He does not say, "When I
shall receive the congregation I will take my ease, and take state upon
me, and leave the public business to others;" but, "I will mind it
myself." 2. Public trusts are to be managed with great integrity; those
that judge must judge uprightly, according to the rules of justice,
without respect of persons.

III\. He promises himself that his government would be a public blessing
to Israel, [Psa 75:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#003.md). The present
state of the kingdom was very bad: The earth and all the inhabitants
thereof are dissolved; and no marvel, when the former reign was so
dissolute that all went to wrack and ruin. There was a general
corruption of manners, for want of putting the laws in execution against
vice and profaneness. They were divided one from another for want of
centering, as they ought to have done, in the government God had
appointed. They were all to pieces, two against three and three against
two, crumbled into factions and parties, which was likely to issue in
their ruin; but I bear up the pillars of it. Even in Saul's time David
did what he could for the public welfare; but he hoped that when he had
himself received the congregation he should do much more, and should not
only prevent the public ruin, but recover the public strength and
beauty. Now, 1. See the mischief of parties; they melt and dissolve a
land and the inhabitants of it. 2. See how much one head frequently
holds up. The fabric would have sunk if David had not held up the
pillars of it. This may well be applied to Christ and his government.
The world and all the inhabitants of it were dissolved by sin; man's
apostasy threatened the destruction of the whole creation. But Christ
bore up the pillars of it; he saved the whole world from utter ruin by
saving his people from their sins, and into his hand the administration
of the kingdom of Providence is committed, for he upholds all things by
the word of his power, [Heb 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md).

IV\. He checks those that opposed his government, that were against his
accession to it and obstructed the administration of it, striving to
keep up that vice and profaneness which he had made it his business to
suppress ([Psa 75:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#004.md), [Psa
75:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#005).md): I said unto the fools, Deal not
foolishly. He had said so to them in Saul's time. When he had not power
to restrain them, yet he had wisdom and grace to reprove them, and to
give them good counsel; though they bore themselves high, upon the
favour of that unhappy prince, he cautioned them not to be too
presumptuous. Or, rather, he does now say so to them. As soon as he came
to the crown he issued out a proclamation against vice and profaneness,
and here we have the contents of it. 1. To the simple sneaking sinners,
the fools in Israel, that corrupted themselves, to them he said, "Deal
not foolishly; do not act so directly contrary both to your reason and
to your interest as you do while you walk contrary to the laws God has
given to Israel and the promises he has made to David." Christ, the son
of David, gives us this counsel, issues out this edict, Deal not
foolishly. He who is made of God to us wisdom bids us be wise for
ourselves, and not make fools of ourselves. 2. To the proud daring
sinners, the wicked, that set God himself at defiance, he says, "Lift
not up the horn; boast not of your power and prerogatives; persist not
in your contumacy and contempt of the government set over you; lift not
up your horn on high, as though you could have what you will and do what
you will; speak not with a stiff neck, in which is an iron sinew, that
will never bend to the will of God in the government; for those that
will not bend shall break; those whose necks are stiffened are so to
their own destruction." This is Christ's word of command in his gospel,
that every mountain will be brought low before him, [Isa
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#004.md). Let not the anti-christian
power, with its heads and horns, lift up itself against him, for it
shall certainly be broken to pieces; what is said with a stiff neck must
be unsaid again with a broken heart, or we are undone. Pharaoh said with
a stiff neck, Who is the Lord? But God made him know to his cost.

[Psalms 75:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 75:6</span></span>

In these verses we have two great doctrines laid down and two good
inferences drawn from them, for the confirmation of what he had before
said.

I. Here are two great truths laid down concerning God's government of
the world, which we ought to mix faith with, both pertinent to the
occasion: -

1\. That from God alone kings receive their power ([Psa
75:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#006.md), [Psa
75:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#007).md), and therefore to God alone
David would give the praise of his advancement; having his power from
God he would use it for him, and therefore those were fools that lifted
up the horn against him. We see strange revolutions in states and
kingdoms, and are surprised at the sudden disgrace of some and elevation
of others; we are all full of such changes, when they happen; but here
we are directed to look at the author of them, and are taught where the
original of power is, and whence promotion comes. Whence comes
preferment to kingdoms, to the sovereignty of them? And whence come
preferments in kingdoms, to places of power and trust in them? The
former depends not upon the will of the people, nor the latter on the
will of the prince, but both on the will of God, who has all hearts in
his hands; to him therefore those must look who are in pursuit of
preferment, and then they begin aright. We are here told, (1.)
Negatively, which way we are not to look for the fountain of power:
Promotion comes not from the east, nor from the west, nor from the
desert, that is, neither from the desert on the north of Jerusalem nor
from that on the south; so that the fair gale of preferment is not to be
expected to blow from any point of the compass, but only from above,
directly thence. Men cannot gain promotion either by the wisdom or
wealth of the children of the east, nor by the numerous forces of the
isles of the Gentiles, that lay westward, nor those of Egypt or Arabia,
that lay south; no concurring smiles of second causes will raise men to
preferment without the first cause. The learned bishop Lloyd (Serm. in
loc.) gives this gloss upon it: "All men took the original of power to
be from heaven, but from whom there many knew not; the eastern nations,
who were generally given to astrology, took it to come from their stars,
especially the sun, their god. No, says David, it comes neither from the
east nor from the west, neither from the rising nor from the setting of
such a planet, or such a constellation, nor from the south, nor from the
exaltation of the sun or any star in the mid-heaven." He mentions not
the north, because none supposed it to come thence; or because the same
word that signifies the north signifies the secret place, and from the
secret of God's counsel it does come, or from the oracle in Zion, which
lay on the north side of Jerusalem. Note, No wind is so good as to blow
promotion, but as he directs who has the winds in his fists. (2.)
Positively: God is the judge, the governor or umpire. When parties
contend for the prize, he puts down one and sets up another as he sees
fit, so as to serve his own purposes and bring to pass his own counsels.
Herein he acts by prerogative, and is not accountable to us for any of
these matters; nor is it any damage, danger, or disgrace that he, who is
infinitely wise, holy, and good, has an arbitrary and despotic power to
set up and put down whom, and when, and how he pleases. This is a good
reason why magistrates should rule for God as those that must give
account to him, because it is by him that kings reign.

2\. That from God alone all must receive their doom ([Psa
75:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008).md): In the hand of the Lord there
is a cup, which he puts into the hands of the children of men, a cup of
providence, mixed up (as he thinks fit) of many ingredients, a cup of
affliction. The sufferings of Christ are called a cup, [Mat
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#022.md); [Joh
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#011.md). The judgments of God upon
sinners are the cup of the Lord's right hand, [Hab
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#016.md). The wine is red, denoting the
wrath of God, which is infused into the judgments executed on sinners,
and is the wormwood and the gall in the affliction and the misery. It is
read as fire, red as blood, for it burns, it kills. It is full of
mixture, prepared in wisdom, so as to answer the end. There are mixtures
of mercy and grace in the cup of affliction when it is put into the
hands of God's own people, mixtures of the curse when it is put into the
hands of the wicked; it is wine mingled with gall. These vials, (1.) Are
poured out upon all; see [Rev 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#007.md);
[Rev 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#001.md); where we read of the angels
pouring out the vials of God's wrath upon the earth. Some drops of this
wrath may light on good people; when God's judgments are abroad, they
have their share in common calamities; but, (2.) The dregs of the cup
are reserved for the wicked. The calamity itself is but the vehicle into
which the wrath and curse is infused, the top of which has little of the
infusion; but the sediment is pure wrath, and that shall fall to the
share of sinners; they have the dregs of the cup now in the terrors of
conscience, and hereafter in the torments of hell. They shall wring them
out, that not a drop of the wrath may be left behind, and they shall
drink them, for the curse shall enter into their bowels like water and
like oil into their bones. The cup of the Lord's indignation will be to
them a cup of trembling, everlasting trembling, [Rev
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#010.md). The wicked man's cup, while he
prospers in the world, is full of mixture, but the worst is at the
bottom. The wicked are reserved unto the day of judgment.

II\. Here are two good practical inferences drawn from these great
truths, and they are the same purposes of duty that he began the psalm
with. This being so, 1. He will praise God, and give him glory, for the
power to which he has advanced him ([Psa
75:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#009).md): I will declare for ever that
which thy wondrous works declare, [Psa
75:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001.md). He will praise God for his
elevation, not only at first, while the mercy was fresh, but for ever,
so long as he lives. The exaltation of the Son of David will be the
subject of the saints' everlasting praises. He will give glory to God,
not only as his God, but as the God of Jacob, knowing it was for Jacob
his servant's sake, and because he loved his people Israel, that he made
him king over them. 2. He will use the power with which he is entrusted
for the great ends for which it was put into his hands, [Psa
75:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#010.md), as before, [Psa
75:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#002.md), [Psa
75:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#004.md). According to the duty of the
higher powers, (1.) He resolves to be a terror to evildoers, to humble
their pride and break their power: "Though not all the heads, yet all
the horns, of the wicked will I cut off, with which they push their poor
neighbours; I will disable them to do mischief." Thus God promises to
raise up carpenters who should fray the horns of the Gentiles that had
scattered Judah and Israel, [Zac
1:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#018). (2..md) He resolves to be a
protection and praise to those that do well: The horns of the righteous
shall be exalted; they shall be preferred and be put into places of
power; and those that are good, and have hearts to do good, shall not
want ability and opportunity for it. This agrees with David's
resolutions, [Psa 101:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#003.md), etc. Herein
David was a type of Christ, who with the breath of his mouth shall slay
the wicked, but shall exalt with honour the horn of the righteous, [Psa
112:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009.md).
