### [Exodus Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 27:0</span></span>

In this chapter directions are given, I. Concerning the brazen altar for
burnt-offerings ([Exo 27:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001)). II.
Concerning the court of the tabernacle, with the hangings of it ([Exo
27:9-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#009)). III. Concerning oil for the
lamp ([Exo 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#020), [Exo
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#021)).

[Exodus 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 27:1</span></span>

As God intended in the tabernacle to manifest his presence among his
people, so there they were to pay their devotions to him, not in the
tabernacle itself (into that only the priests entered as God's domestic
servants), but in the court before the tabernacle, where, as common
subjects, they attended. There an altar was ordered to be set up, to
which they must bring their sacrifices, and on which their priests must
offer them to God: and this altar was to sanctify their gifts. Here they
were to present their services to God, as from the mercy-seat he gave
his oracles to them; and thus a communion was settled between God and
Israel. Moses is here directed about, 1. The dimensions of it; it was
square, [Exo 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001). 2. The horns of it
([Exo 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#002)), which were for ornament
and for use; the sacrifices were bound with cords to the horns of the
altar, and to them malefactors fled for refuge. 3. The materials; it was
of wood overlaid with brass, [Exo
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001), [Exo
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#002). 4. The appurtenances of it ([Exo
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#003)), which were all of brass. 5. The
grate, which was let into the hollow of the altar, about the middle of
it, in which the fire was kept, and the sacrifice burnt; it was made of
network like a sieve, and hung hollow, that the fire might burn the
better, and that the ashes might fall through into the hollow of the
altar, [Exo 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#004), [Exo
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#005). 6. The staves with which it must
be carried, [Exo 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#006), [Exo
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#007). And, lastly, he is referred to
the pattern shown him, [Exo 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#008).

Now this brazen altar was a type of Christ dying to make atonement for
our sins: the wood would have been consumed by the fire from heaven if
it had not been secured by the brass; nor could the human nature of
Christ have borne the wrath of God if it had not been supported by a
divine power. Christ sanctified himself for his church, as their altar
([Joh 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#019)), and by his mediation
sanctifies the daily services of his people, who have also a right to
eat of this altar ([Heb 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#010)), for
they serve at it as spiritual priests. To the horns of this altar poor
sinners fly for refuge when justice pursues them, and they are safe in
virtue of the sacrifice there offered.

[Exodus 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 27:9</span></span>

Before the tabernacle there was to be a court or yard, enclosed with
hangings of the finest linen that was used for tents. This court,
according to the common computation of cubits, was fifty yards long, and
twenty-five broad. Pillars were set up at convenient distances, in
sockets of brass, the pillars filleted with silver, and silver
tenter-hooks in them, on which the linen hangings were fastened: the
hanging which served for the gate was finer than the rest, [Exo
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#016). This court was a type of the
church, enclosed and distinguished from the rest of the world, the
enclosure supported by pillars, denoting the stability of the church,
hung with the clean linen, which is said to be the righteousness of
saints, [Rev 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008). These were the
courts David longed for and coveted to reside in ([Psa
84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002), [Psa
84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010)), and into which the people of
God entered with praise and thanksgiving ([Psa
100:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#004)); yet this court would contain
but a few worshippers. Thanks be to God, now, under the gospel, the
enclosure is taken down. God's will is that men pray every where; and
there is room for all that in every place call on the name of Jesus
Christ.

[Exodus 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 27:20</span></span>

We read of the candlestick in the twenty-fifth chapter; here is an order
given for the keeping of the lamps constantly burning in it, else it was
useless; in every candlestick there should be a burning and shining
light; candlesticks without candles are as wells without water or as
clouds without rain. Now, 1. The people were to provide the oil; from
them the Lord's ministers must have their maintenance. Or, rather, the
pure oil signified the gifts and graces of the Spirit, which are
communicated to all believers from Christ the good olive, of whose
fulness we receive ([Zac 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#011), [Zac
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#012)), and without which our light
cannot shine before men. 2. The priests were to light the lamps, and to
tend them; it was part of their daily service to cause the lamp to burn
always, night and day; thus it is the work of ministers, by the
preaching and expounding of the scriptures (which are as a lamp), to
enlighten the church, God's tabernacle upon the earth, and to direct the
spiritual priests in his service. This is to be a statute for ever, that
the lamps of the word be lighted as duly as the incense of prayer and
praise is offered.
