### [Isaiah Chapter 54](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 54:0</span></span>

The death of Christ is the life of the church and of all that truly
belong to it; and therefore very fitly, after the prophet had foretold
the sufferings of Christ, he foretels the flourishing of the church,
which is a part of his glory, and that exaltation of him which was the
reward of his humiliation: it was promised him that he should see his
seed, and this chapter is an explication of that promise. It may easily
be granted that it has a primary reference to the welfare and prosperity
of the Jewish church after their return out of Babylon, which (as other
things that happened to them) was typical of the glorious liberty of the
children of God, which through Christ we are brought into; yet it cannot
be denied but that it has a further and principal reference to the
gospel church, into which the Gentiles were to be admitted. And the
first words being understood by the apostle Paul of the New Testament
Jerusalem ([Gal 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026).md) may serve as a
key to the whole chapter and that which follows. It is here promised
concerning the Christian church, I. That, though the beginnings of it
were small, it should be greatly enlarged by the accession of many to it
among the Gentiles, who had been wholly destitute of church privileges
([Isa 54:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001).md). II. That though
sometimes God might seem to withdraw from her, and suspend the tokens of
his favour, he would return in mercy and would not return to contend
with them any more ([Isa 54:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#006).md).
III. That, though for a while she was in sorrow and under oppression,
she should at length be advanced to greater honour and splendour than
ever ([Isa 54:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#011.md), [Isa
54:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#012).md). IV. That knowledge,
righteousness, and peace, should flourish and prevail ([Isa
54:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013.md), [Isa
54:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#014).md). V. That all attempts against
the church should be baffled, and she should be secured from the malice
of her enemies ([Isa 54:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#014).md).

[Isaiah 54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 54:1</span></span>

If we apply this to the state of the Jews after their return out of
captivity, it is a prophecy of the increase of their nation after they
were settled in their own land. Jerusalem had been in the condition of a
wife written childless, or a desolate solitary widow; but now it is
promised that the city should be replenished and the country peopled
again, that not only the ruins of Jerusalem should be repaired, but the
suburbs of it extended on all sides and a great many buildings erected
upon new foundations, - that those estates which had for many years been
wrongfully held by the Babylonian Gentiles should now return to the
right owners. God will again be a husband to them, and the reproach of
their captivity, and the small number to which they were then reduced,
shall be forgotten. And it is to be observed that, by virtue of the
ancient promise made to Abraham of the increase of his seed, when they
were restored to God's favour they multiplied greatly. Those that first
came out of Babylon were but 42,000 ([Ezr
2:64](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#064).md), about a fifteenth part of their
number when they came out of Egypt; many came dropping to them
afterwards, but we may suppose that to be the greatest number that ever
came in a body; and yet above 500 years after, a little before their
destruction by the Romans, a calculation was made by the number of the
paschal lambs, and the lowest computation by that rule (allowing only
ten to a lamb, whereas they might be twenty) made the nation to be
nearly three millions. Josephus says, seven and twenty hundred thousand
and odd, Jewish War 6.425. But we must apply it to the church of God in
general; I mean the kingdom of God among men, God's city in the world,
the children of God incorporated. Now observe,

I. The low and languishing state of religion in the world for a long
time before Christianity was brought in. It was like one barren, that
did not bear, or travail with child, was like one desolate, that had
lost husband and children; the church lay in a little compass, and
brought forth little fruit. The Jews were indeed by profession married
to God, but few proselytes were added to them, the rising generations
were unpromising, and serious godliness manifestly lost ground among
them. The Gentiles had less religion among them than the Jews; their
proselytes were in a dispersion; and the children of God, like the
children of a broken, reduced family, were scattered abroad ([Joh
11:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#052).md), did not appear nor make any
figure.

II\. Its recovery from this low condition by the preaching of the gospel
and the planting of the Christian church.

1\. Multitudes were converted from idols to the living God. Those were
the church's children that were born again, were partakers of a new and
divine nature, by the word. More were the children of the desolate than
of the married wife; there were more good people found in the Gentile
church (when that was set up) that had long been afar off, and without
God in the world, than ever were found in the Jewish church. God's
sealed ones out of the tribes of Israel are numbered ([Rev
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#004).md), and they were but a remnant
compared with the thousands of Israel; but those of other nations were
so many, and crowded in so thickly, and lay so much scattered in all
parts, that no man could number them, [Isa
54:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#009.md). Sometimes more of the power of
religion is found in those places and families that have made little
show of it, and have enjoyed but little of the means of grace, than in
others that have distinguished themselves by a flourishing profession;
and then more are the children of the desolate, more the fruits of their
righteousness, than those of the married wife; so the last shall be
first. Now this is spoken of as matter of great rejoicing to the church,
which is called upon to break forth into singing upon this account. The
increase of the church is the joy of all its friends and strengthens
their hands. The longer the church has lain desolate the greater will
the transports of joy be when it begins to recover the ground it has
lost and to gain more. Even in heaven, among the angels of God, there is
an uncommon joy for a sinner that repents, much more for a nation that
does so. If the barren fig-tree at length bring forth fruit, it is well;
it shall rejoice, and others with it.

2\. The bounds of the church were extended much further than ever
before, [Isa 54:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#002.md), [Isa
54:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#003). (1..md) It is here supposed that
the present state of the church is a tabernacle state; it dwells in
tents, like the heirs of promise of old ([Heb
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009).md); its dwelling is mean and
movable, and of no strength against a storm. The city, the continuing
city, is reserved for hereafter. A tent is soon taken down and shifted,
so the candlestick of church privileges is soon removed out of its place
([Rev 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#005).md), and, when God pleases, it
is as soon fixed elsewhere. (2.) Though it be a tabernacle state, it is
sometimes very remarkably a growing state; and, if this family increase,
no matter though it be in a tent. Thus it was in the first preaching of
the gospel; it was the business of the apostles to disciple all nations,
to stretch forth the curtains of the church's habitation, to preach the
gospel where Christ had not yet been named ([Rom
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#020).md), to leaven with the gospel
those towns and countries that had hitherto been strangers to it, and so
to lengthen the cords of this tabernacle, that more might be enclosed,
which would make it necessary to strengthen the stakes proportionably,
that they might bear the weight of the enlarged curtains. The more
numerous the church grows the more cautious she must be to fortify
herself against errors and corruptions, and to support her seven
pillars, [Pro 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001). (3..md) It was a proof
of divine power going along with the gospel that in all places it grew
and prevailed mightily, [Act 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#020.md). It
broke forth, as the breaking forth of waters - on the right hand and on
the left, that is, on all hands. The gospel spread itself into all parts
of the world; there were eastern and western churches. The church's seed
inherited the Gentiles, and the cities that had been desolate (that is,
destitute of the knowledge and worship of the true God) came to be
inhabited, that is, to have religion set up in them and the name of
Christ professed.

3\. This was the comfort and honour of the church ([Isa
54:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#004).md): "Fear not, for thou shalt not
be ashamed, as formerly, of the straitness of thy borders, and the
fewness of thy children, which thy enemies upbraided thee with, but
shalt forget the reproach of thy youth, because there shall be no more
ground for that reproach." It was the reproach of the Christian
religion, in its youth, that none of the rulers or princes of this world
embraced it and that it was entertained and professed by a despicable
handful of men; but, after awhile, nations were discipled, the empire
became Christian, and then this reproach of its youth was forgotten.

4\. This was owing to the relation in which God stood to his church, as
her husband ([Isa 54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005).md): Thy maker is
thy husband. Believers are said to be married to Christ, that they may
bring forth fruit unto God ([Rom 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#004).md);
so the church is married to him, that she may bear and bring up a holy
seed to God, that shall be accounted to him for a generation. Jesus
Christ is the church's Maker, by whom she is formed into a people - her
Redeemer, by whom she is brought out of captivity, the bondage of sin,
the worst of slaveries. This is he that espoused her to himself; and,
(1.) He is the Lord of hosts, who has an irresistible power, an absolute
sovereignty, and a universal dominion! Kings who are lords of some
hosts, find there are others who are lords of other hosts, as many and
mighty as theirs; but God is the Lord of all hosts. (2.) He is the Holy
One of Israel, the same that presided in the affairs of the Old
Testament church and was the Mediator of the covenant made with it. The
promises made to the New Testament Israel are as rich and sure as those
made to the Old Testament Israel; for he that is our Redeemer is the
Holy One of Israel. (3.) He is and shall be called the Lord of the whole
earth, as God, and as Mediator, for he is the heir of all things; but
then he shall be called so, when the ends of the earth shall be made to
see his salvation, when all the earth shall call him their God and have
an interest in him. Long he had been called, in a peculiar manner, the
God of Israel; but now, the partition wall between Jew and Gentile being
taken down, he shall be called the God of the whole earth even where he
has been, as at Athens itself, an unknown God.

[Isaiah 54:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 54:6</span></span>

The seasonable succour and relief which God sent to his captives in
Babylon, when they had a discharge from their bondage there, are here
foretold, as a type and figure of all those consolations of God which
are treasured up for the church in general and all believers in
particular, in the covenant of grace.

I. Look back to former troubles, and in comparison with them God's
favours to his people appear very comfortable, [Isa
54:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#006.md). Observe, 1. How sorrowful the
church's condition had been. She had been as a woman forsaken, whose
husband was dead, or had fallen out with her, though she was a wife of
youth, upon which account she is grieved in spirit, takes it very ill,
frets, and grows melancholy upon it; or she had been as one refused and
rejected, and therefore full of discontent. Note, Even those that are
espoused to God may yet seem to be refused and forsaken, and may be
grieved in spirit under the apprehensions of being so. Those that shall
never be forsaken and left in despair may yet for a time be perplexed
and in distress. The similitude is explained ([Isa
54:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#007.md), [Isa
54:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#008).md): For a small moment have I
forsaken thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee. When God
continues his people long in trouble he seems to forsake them; so their
enemies construe it ([Psa 71:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#011).md); so
they themselves misinterpret it, [Isa
49:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#014.md). When they are comfortless under
their troubles, because their prayers and expectations are not answered,
God hides his face from them, as if he regarded them not nor designed
them any kindness. God owns that he had done this; for he keeps an
account of the afflictions of his people, and, though he never turned
his face against them (as against the wicked, [Psa
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#016).md), he remembers how often he
turned his back upon them. This arose indeed from his displeasure. It
was in wrath that he forsook them and hid his face from them ([Isa
57:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#017).md); yet it was but in a little
wrath: not that God's wrath ever is a little thing, or to be made light
of (Who knows the power of his anger?), but little in comparison with
what they had deserved, and what others justly suffer, on whom the full
vials of his wrath are poured out. He did not stir up all his wrath. But
God's people, though they be sensible of ever so small a degree of God's
displeasure, cannot but be grieved in spirit because of it. As for the
continuance of it, it was but for a moment, a small moment; for God does
not keep his anger against his people for ever; no, it is soon over. As
he is slow to anger, so he is swift to show mercy. The afflictions of
God's people, as they are light, so they are but for a moment, a cloud
that presently blows over. 2. How sweet the returns of mercy would be to
them when God should come and comfort them according to the time that he
had afflicted them. God called them into covenant with himself when they
were forsaken and grieved; he called them out of their afflictions when
they were most pressing, [Isa 54:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#006.md).
God's anger endures for a moment, but he will gather his people when
they think themselves neglected, will gather them out of their
dispersions, that they may return in a body to their own land, - will
gather them into his arms, to protect them, embrace them, and bear them
up, - and will gather them at last to himself, will gather the wheat
into the barn. He will have mercy on them. This supposes the turning
away of his anger and the admitting of them again into his favour. God's
gathering his people takes rise from his mercy, not any merit of others;
and it is with great mercies ([Isa
54:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#007).md), with everlasting kindness, [Isa
54:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#008.md). The wrath is little, but the
mercies are great; the wrath is for a moment, but the kindness
everlasting. See how one is set over against the other, that we may
neither despond under our afflictions nor despair of relief.

II\. Look forward to future dangers, and in defiance of them God's
favours to his people appear very constant, and his kindness
everlasting; for it is formed into a covenant, here called a covenant of
peace, because it is founded in reconciliation and is inclusive of all
good. Now,

1\. This is as firm as the covenant of providence. It is as the waters
of Noah, that is, as that promise which was made concerning the deluge
that there should never be the like again to disturb the course of
summer and winter, seed-time and harvest, [Isa
54:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#009.md). God then contended with the
world in great wrath, and for a full year, and yet at length returned in
mercy, everlasting mercy; for he gave his word, which was as inviolable
as his oath, that Noah's flood should never return, that he would never
drown the world again; see [Gen 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021.md),
[Gen 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#022.md); [Gen
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#011.md). And God has ever since kept his
word, though the world has been very provoking; and he will keep it to
the end; for the world that now is is reserved unto fire. And thus
inviolable is the covenant of grace: I have sworn that I would not be
wroth with thee, as I have been, and rebuke thee, as I have done. He
will not be so angry with them as to cast them off and break his
covenant with them ([Psa 89:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#034).md), nor
rebuke them as he has rebuked the heathen, to destroy them, and put out
their name for ever and ever, [Psa
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#005.md).

2\. It is more firm than the strongest parts of the visible creation
([Isa 54:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#010).md): The mountains shall
depart, which are called everlasting mountains, and the hills be
removed, though they are called perpetual hills, [Hab
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#006.md). Sooner shall they remove than
God's covenant with his people be broken. Mountains have sometimes been
shaken by earthquakes, and removed; but the promises of God were never
broken by the shock of any event. The day will come when all the
mountains shall depart and all the hills be removed, not only the tops
of them covered, as they were by the waters of Noah, but the roots of
them torn up; for the earth and all the works that are therein shall be
burned up; but then the covenant of peace between God and believers
shall continue in the everlasting bliss of all those who are the
children of that covenant. Mountains and hills signify great men, men of
bulk and figure. Do these mountains seem to support the skies (as Atlas)
and bear them up? They shall depart and be removed. Creature-confidences
shall fail us. In vain is salvation hoped for from those hills and
mountains. But the firmament is firm, and answers to its name, when
those who seem to prop it are gone. When our friends fail us our God
does not, nor does his kindness depart? Do these mountains threaten, and
seem to top the skies, and bid defiance to them, as Pelion and Ossa? Do
the kings of the earth, and the rulers, set themselves against the Lord?
They shall depart and be removed. Great mountains, that stand in the way
of the salvation of the church, shall be made plain ([Zac
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#007).md); but God's kindness shall never
depart from his people, for whom he loves he loves to the end; nor shall
the covenant of his peace ever be removed, for he is the Lord that has
mercy on his people. Therefore the covenant is immovable and inviolable,
because it is built not on our merit, which is a mutable uncertain
thing, but on God's mercy, which is from everlasting to everlasting.

[Isaiah 54:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 54:11</span></span>

Very precious promises are here made to the church in her low condition,
that God would not only continue his love to his people under their
troubles as before, but that he would restore them to their former
prosperity, nay, that he would raise them to greater prosperity than any
they had yet enjoyed. In the foregoing chapter we had the humiliation
and exaltation of Christ; here we have the humiliation and exaltation of
the church; for, if we suffer with him, we shall reign with him.
Observe,

I. The distressed state the church is here reduced to by the providence
of God ([Isa 54:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#011).md): "O thou
afflicted, poor, and indigent society, that art tossed with tempests,
like a ship driven from her anchors by a storm and hurried into the
ocean, where she is ready to be swallowed up by the waves, and in this
condition not comforted by any compassionate friend that will sympathize
with thee, or suggest to thee any encouraging considerations ([Ecc
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001).md), not comforted by any allay to
thy trouble, or prospect of deliverance out of it." This was the
condition of the Jews in Babylon, and afterwards, for a time, under
Antiochus. It is often the condition of Christian churches and of
particular believers; without are fightings, within are fears; they are
like the disciples in a storm, ready to perish; and where is their
faith?

II\. The glorious state the church is here advanced to by the promise of
God. God takes notice of the afflicted distressed state of his church,
and comforts her, when she is most disconsolate and has no other
comforter. Let the people of God, when they are afflicted and tossed,
think they hear God speaking comfortably to them by these words, taking
notice of their griefs and fears, what afflictions they are under, what
distresses they are in, and what comforts their case calls for. When
they bemoan themselves, God bemoans them, and speaks to them with pity:
O thou afflicted, tossed with tempests, and not comforted; for in all
their afflictions he is afflicted. But this is not all; he engages to
raise her up out of her affliction, and encourages her with the
assurance of the great things he would do for her, both for her
prosperity and for the securing of that prosperity to her.

1\. Whereas now she lay in disgrace, God promises that which would be
her beauty and honour, which would make her easy to herself and amiable
in the eyes of others.

(1.) This is here promised by a similitude taken from a city, and it is
an apt similitude, for the church is the city of the living God, the
heavenly Jerusalem. Whereas now Jerusalem lay in ruins, a heap of
rubbish, it shall be not only rebuilt, but beautified, and appear more
splendid than ever; the stones shall be laid not only firm, but fine,
laid with fair colours; they shall be glistering stones, [Ch1
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#002.md). The foundations shall be laid or
garnished with sapphires, the most precious of the precious stones here
mentioned; for Christ (the church's foundation), and the foundation of
the apostles and prophets, are precious above any thing else. The
windows of this house, city, or temple, shall be made of agates, the
gates of carbuncles, and all the borders (the walls that enclose the
courts, or the boundaries by which her limits are marked, the
mere-stones) shall be of pleasant stones, [Isa
54:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#012.md). Never was this literally true;
but it intimates, \[1.\] That, God having graciously undertaken to build
his church, we may expect that to be done for it, that to be wrought in
it, which is very great and uncommon. \[2.\] That the glory of the New
Testament church shall far exceed that of the Jewish church, not in
external pomp and splendour, but in those gifts and graces of the Spirit
which are infinitely more valuable, that wisdom which is more precious
than rubies ([Pro 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#015).md), than the
precious onyx and the sapphire, and which the topaz of Ethiopia cannot
equal, [Job 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#016.md), [Job
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#019.md). \[3.\] That the wealth of this
world, and those things of it that are accounted most precious, shall be
despised by all the true living members of the church, as having no
value, no glory, in comparison with that which far excels. That which
the children of this world lay up among their treasures, and too often
in their hearts, the children of God make pavements of, and put under
their feet, the fittest place of it.

(2.) It is here promised in the particular instances of those things
that shall be the beauty and honour of the church, which are knowledge,
holiness, and love, the very image of God, in which man was created,
renewed, and restored. And these are the sapphires and carbuncles, the
precious and pleasant stones, with which the gospel temple shall be
enriched and beautified, and these wrought by the power and efficacy of
those doctrines which the apostle compares to gold or silver, and
precious stones, that are to be built upon the foundation, [Co1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#012.md). Then the church is all glorious,
\[1.\] When it is full of the knowledge of God, and that is promised
here ([Isa 54:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013).md): All thy children
shall be taught of the Lord. The church's children, being born of God,
shall be taught of God; being his children by adoption, he will take
care of their education. It was promised ([Isa
54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001).md) that the church's children
should be many; but lest we should think that being many, as sometimes
it happens in numerous families, they will be neglected, and not have
instruction given them so carefully as if they were but few, God here
takes that work into his own hand: They shall all be taught of the Lord;
and none teaches like him. First, It is a promise of the means of
instruction and those means authorized by a divine institution: They
shall all be taught of God, that is, they shall be taught by those whom
God shall appoint and whose labours shall be under his direction and
blessing. He will ordain the methods of instruction, and by his word and
ordinances will diffuse a much greater light than the Old Testament
church had. Care shall be taken for the teaching of the church's
children, that knowledge may be transmitted from generation to
generation, and that all may be enriched with it, from the least even to
the greatest. Secondly, It is a promise of the Spirit of illumination.
Our Saviour quotes it with application to gospel grace, and makes it to
have its accomplishment in all those that were brought to believe in him
([Joh 6:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#045).md): It is written in the
prophets, They shall be all taught of God, whence he infers that those,
and those only, come to him by faith that have heard and learned of the
Father, that are taught by him as the truth is in Jesus, [Eph
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#021.md). There shall be a plentiful
effusion of the Spirit of grace upon Christians, to teach them all
things, [Joh 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026.md). \[2.\] When the
members of it live in love and unity among themselves: Great shall be
the peace of thy children. Peace may be taken here for all good. As
where no knowledge of God is no good can be expected, so those that are
taught of God to know him are in a fair way to prosper for both worlds.
Great peace have those that know and love God's law, [Psa
119:165](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#165.md). But it is often put for love
and unity; and so we may take it. All that are taught of God are taught
to love one another ([Th1 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#009).md) and
that will keep peace among the church's children and prevent their
falling out by the way. \[3.\] When holiness reigns; for that above any
thing is the beauty of the church ([Isa
54:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#014).md): In righteousness shall thou be
established. The reformation of manners, the restoration of purity, the
due administration of public justice, and the prevailing of honesty and
fair dealing among men, are the strength and stability of any church or
state. The kingdom of God, set up by the gospel of Christ, is not meat
and drink, but this righteousness and peace, holiness and love.

2\. Whereas now she lay in danger, God promises that which would be her
protection and security.

(1.) God engages here that though, in the day of her distress, without
were fightings and within were fears, now she shall be safe from both.
\[1.\] There shall be no fears within ([Isa
54:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#014).md): "Thou shalt be far from
oppression. Those that have oppressed thee shall be removed, those that
would oppress thee shall be restrained, and therefore thou shalt not
fear, but mayest look upon it as a thing at a great distance, that thou
art now in no danger of. Thou shalt be far from terror, not only from
evil, but from the fear of evil, for it shall not come near thee so as
to do thee any hurt or to put thee in any fright." Note, Those are far
from terror that are far from oppression; for it is as great a terror as
can fall on a people to have the rod of government turned into the
serpent of oppression, because against this there is no fence, nor is
there any flight from it. \[2.\] There shall be no fightings without.
Though attempts should be made upon them to insult them, to invade their
country, or besiege their towns, they should all be in vain, and none of
them succeed, [Isa 54:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#015.md). It is
granted, "They shall surely gather together against thee; thou must
expect it." The confederate force of hell and earth will be renewing
their assaults. As long as there is a devil in hell, and a persecutor
out of it, God's people must expect frequent alarms; but, First, God
will not own them, will not give them either commission or countenance;
they gather together, hand joins in hand, but it is not by me. God gave
them no such order as he did to Sennacherib, to take the spoil, and to
take the prey, [Isa 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#006.md). And
therefore, Secondly, Their attempt will end in their own ruin:
"Whosoever shall gather together against thee, be they ever so many and
ever so mighty, they shall not only be baffled, but they shall fall for
thy sake, or they shall fall before thee, which shall be the just
punishment of their enmity to thee." God will make them to fall for the
sake of the love he bears to his church and the care he has of it, in
answer to the prayers made by his people, and in pursuance of the
promises made to them. "They shall fall, that thou mayest stand," [Psa
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#002.md).

(2.) That we may with the greatest assurance depend upon God for the
safety of his church, we have here, \[1.\] The power of God over the
church's enemies asserted, [Isa 54:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#016.md).
The truth is they have no power but what is given them from above, and
he that gave them their power can limit and restrain them. Hitherto they
shall go, and no further. First, They cannot carry on their design
without arms and weapons of war; and the smith that makes those weapons
is God's creature, and he gave him his skill to work in iron and brass
([Exo 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#003.md), [Exo
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#004).md) and particularly to make proper
instruments for warlike purposes. It is melancholy to think, as if men
did not die fast enough of themselves, how ingenious and industrious
they are to make instruments of death and to find out ways and means to
kill one another. The smith blows the coals in the fire, to make his
iron malleable, to soften it first, that it may be hardened into steel,
and so he may bring forth an instrument proper for the work of those
that seek to destroy. It is the iron age that is the age of war. But God
has created the smith, and therefore can tie his hands, so that the
project of the enemy shall miscarry (as many a project has done) for
want of arms and ammunition. Or the smith that forges the weapons is
perhaps put here for the council of war that forms the design, blows the
coals of contention, and brings forth the plan of the war; these can do
no more than God will let them. Secondly, They cannot carry it on
without men, they must have soldiers, and it is God that created the
waster to destroy. Military men value themselves upon their great
offices and splendid titles, and even the common soldiers call
themselves gentlemen; but God calls them wasters made to destroy, for
wasting and destruction are their business. They think their own
ingenuity, labour, and experience, made them soldiers; but it was God
that created them, and gave them strength and spirit for that hazardous
employment; and therefore he not only can restrain them, but will serve
his own purposes and designs by them. \[2.\] The promise of God
concerning the church's safety solemnly laid down, as the heritage of
the servants of the Lord ([Isa 54:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#017).md),
as that which they may depend upon and be confident of, that God will
protect them from their adversaries both in camps and courts. First,
From their field-adversaries, that think to destroy them by force and
violence, and dint of sword: "No weapon that is formed against thee
(though ever so artfully formed by the smith that blows the coals, [Isa
54:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#016.md), though ever so skilfully
managed by the waster that seeks to destroy) shall prosper; it shall not
prove strong enough to do any harm to the people of God; it shall miss
its mark, shall fall out of the hand or perhaps recoil in the face of
him that uses it against thee." It is the happiness of the church that
no weapons formed against it shall prosper long, and therefore the folly
of its enemies will at length be made manifest to all, for they are but
preparing instruments of ruin for themselves. Secondly, From their
law-adversaries, that think to run them down under colour of right and
justice. When the weapons of war do not prosper there are tongues that
rise in judgment. Both are included in the gates of hell, that seek to
destroy the church; for they had their courts of justice, as well as
their magazines and military stores, in their gates. The tongues that
rise in judgment against the church are as such as either demand a
dominion over it, as if God's children were their lawful captives,
pretending an authority to oppress their consciences, or they are such
as misrepresent them, and falsely accuse them, and by slanders and
calumnies endeavour to make them odious to the people and obnoxious to
the government. This the enemies of the Jews did, to incense the kings
of Persia against them, [Ezr 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#012.md);
[Est 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#008.md). "But these insulting
threatening tongues thou shalt condemn; thou shalt have wherewith to
answer their insolent demands, and to put to silence their malicious
reflections. Thou shalt do it by well-doing ([Pe1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#015).md), by doing that which will make
thee manifest in the consciences even of thy adversaries, that thou art
not what thou art represented to be. Thou shalt condemn them, that is,
God shall condemn them for thee. He shall bring forth thy righteousness
as the light, [Psa 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#006.md). Thou shalt
condemn them as Noah condemned the old world that reproached him, by
building the ark, and so saving his house, in contempt of their
contempts." The day is coming when God will reckon with the wicked men
for all their hard speeches which they have spoken against him, [Jde
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#015.md).

The last words refer not only to this promise, but to all that go
before: This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord. God's servants
are his sons, for he has provided an inheritance for them, rich, sure,
and indefeasible. God's promises are their heritage for ever ([Psa
119:111](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#111).md); and their righteousness is
of me, saith the Lord. God will clear up the righteousness of their
cause before men. It is with him, for he knows it; it is with him, for
he will plead it. Or their reward for their righteousness, and for all
that which they have suffered unrighteously, is of God, that God who
judges in the earth, and with whom verily there is a reward for the
righteous. Or their righteousness itself, all that in them which is good
and right, is of God, who works it in them; it is of Christ who is made
righteousness to them. In those for whom God designs a heritage
hereafter he will work righteousness now.
