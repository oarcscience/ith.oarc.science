### [Leviticus Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 27:0</span></span>

The last verse of the foregoing chapter seemed to close up the
statute-book; yet this chapter is added as an appendix. Having given
laws concerning instituted services, here he directs concerning vows and
voluntary services, the free-will offerings of their mouth. Perhaps some
devout serious people among them might be so affected with what Moses
had delivered to them in the foregoing chapter as in a pang of zeal to
consecrate themselves, or their children, or estates to him: this,
because honestly meant, God would accept; but, because men are apt to
repent of such vows, he leaves room for the redemption of what had been
so consecrated, at a certain rate. Here is, I. The law concerning what
was sanctified to God, persons ([Lev
27:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#002).md), cattle, clean or unclean
([Lev 27:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#009).md), houses and lands ([Lev
27:15-25](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#015).md), with an exception of
firstlings, ([Lev 27:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#026.md), [Lev
27:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#027).md). II. Concerning what was
devoted ([Lev 27:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028.md), [Lev
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#029).md). III. Concerning tithes ([Lev
27:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030), etc..md).

[Leviticus 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 27:1</span></span>

This is part of the law concerning singular vows, extraordinary ones,
which though God did not expressly insist on, yet, if they were
consistent with and conformable to the general precepts, he would be
well pleased with. Note, We should not only ask, What must we do, but,
What may we do, for the glory and honour of God? As the liberal devises
liberal things ([Isa 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#008).md), so the
pious devises pious things, and the enlarged heart would willingly do
something extraordinary in the service of so good a Master as God is.
When we receive or expect some singular mercy it is good to honour God
with some singular vow.

I. The case is here put of persons vowed to God by a singular vow, [Lev
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#002.md). If a man consecrated himself, or
a child, to the service of the tabernacle, to be employed there in some
inferior office, as sweeping the floor, carrying out ashes, running of
errands, or the like, the person so consecrated shall be for the Lord,
that is, "God will graciously accept the good-will." Thou didst well
that it was in thy heart, [Ch2 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#008.md).
But forasmuch as he had no occasion to use their service about the
tabernacle, a whole tribe being appropriated to the use of it, those
that were thus vowed were to be redeemed, and the money paid for their
redemption was employed for the repair of the sanctuary, or other uses
of it, as appears by [Kg2 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#014.md), where
it is called, in the margin, the money of the souls of his estimation. A
book of rates is accordingly provided, by which the priests were to go
in their estimation. Here is, 1. The rate of the middle-aged, between
twenty and threescore, these were valued highest, because most
serviceable; a male fifty shekels, and a female thirty, [Lev
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#003.md), [Lev
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#004.md). The females were then less
esteemed, but not so in Christ; for in Christ Jesus there is neither
male nor female, [Gal 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028.md). Note,
Those that are in the prime of their time must look upon themselves as
obliged to do more in the service of God and their generation than can
be expected either from minors, that have not yet arrived to their
usefulness, or from the aged, that have survived it. 2. The rate of the
youth between five years old and twenty was less, because they were then
less capable of doing service, [Lev
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#005.md). 3. Infants under five years old
were capable of being vowed to God by their parents, even before they
were born, as Samuel was, but not to be presented and redeemed till a
month old, that, as one sabbath passed over them before they were
circumcised, so one new moon might pass over them before they were
estimated; and their valuation was but small, [Lev
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#006.md). Samuel, who was thus vowed to
God, was not redeemed, because he was a Levite, and a particular
favourite, and therefore was employed in his childhood in the service of
the tabernacle. 4. The aged are valued less than youth, but more than
children, [Lev 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#007.md). And the Hebrews
observe that the rate of an aged woman is two parts of three to that of
an aged man, so that in that age the female came nearest to the value of
the male, which occasioned (as bishop Patrick quotes it here) this
saying among them, That an old woman in a house is a treasure in a
house. Paul sets a great value upon the aged women, when he makes them
teachers of good things, [Tit 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#003.md). 5.
The poor shall be valued according to their ability, [Lev
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#008.md). Something they must pay, that
they might learn not to be rash in vowing to God, for he hath no
pleasure in fools, [Ecc 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#004.md). Yet not
more than their ability, but secundum tenementum - according to their
possessions, that they might not ruin themselves and their families by
their zeal. Note, God expects and requires from men according to what
they have, and not according to what they have not, [Luk
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#004.md).

II\. The case is put of beasts vowed to God, 1. If it was a clean beast,
such as was offered in sacrifice, it must not be redeemed, nor any
equivalent given for it: It shall be holy, [Lev
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#009.md), [Lev
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#010.md). After it was vowed, it was not
to be put to any common use, nor changed upon second thoughts; but it
must be either offered upon the altar, or, if through any blemish it was
not meet to be offered, he that vowed it should not take advantage of
that, but the priests should have it for their own use (for they were
God's receivers), or it should be sold for the service of the sanctuary.
This teaches caution in making vows and constancy in keeping them when
they are made; for it is a snare to a man to devour that which is holy,
and after vows to make enquiry, [Pro
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#025.md). And to this that rule of
charity seems to allude ([Co2 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007).md),
Every man, according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give. 2.
If it was an unclean beast, it should go to the use of the priest at
such a value; but he that vowed it, upon paying that value in money, and
adding a fifth part more to it, might redeem it if he pleased, [Lev
27:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#011.md). It was fit that men should
smart for their inconstancy. God has let us know his mind concerning his
service, and he is not pleased if we do not know our own. God expects
that those that deal with him should be at a point, and way what they
will stand to.

[Leviticus 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 27:14</span></span>

Here is the law concerning real estates dedicated to the service of God
by a singular vow.

I. Suppose a man, in his zeal for the honour of God, should sanctify his
house to God ([Lev 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#014).md), the house
must be valued by the priest, and the money got by the sale of it was to
be converted to the use of the sanctuary, which by degrees came to be
greatly enriched with dedicated things, [Kg1
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#015.md). But, if the owner be inclined
to redeem it himself, he must not have it so cheap as another, but must
add a fifth part to the price, for he should have considered before he
had vowed it, [Lev 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#015.md). To him that
was necessitous God would abate the estimation ([Lev
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#008).md); but to him that was fickle and
humoursome, and whose second thoughts inclined more to the world and his
secular interest than his first, God would rise in the price. Blessed be
God, there is a way of sanctifying our houses to be holy unto the Lord,
without either selling them or buying them. If we and our houses serve
the Lord, if religion rule in them, and we put away iniquity far from
them, and have a church in our house, holiness to the Lord is written
upon it, it is his, and he will dwell with us in it.

II\. Suppose a man should sanctify some part of his land to the Lord,
giving it to pious uses, then a difference must be made between land
that came to the donor by descent and that which came by purchase, and
accordingly the case altered.

1\. If it was the inheritance of his fathers, here called the field of
his possession, which pertained to his family from the first division of
Canaan, he might not give it all, no, not to the sanctuary; God would
not admit such a degree of zeal as ruined a man's family. But he might
sanctify or dedicate only some part of it, [Lev
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#016). And in that case, (1..md) The land
was to be valued (as our countrymen commonly compute land) by so many
measures' sowing of barley. So much land as would take a homer, or
chomer, of barley, which contained ten ephahs, [Eze
45:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#011.md) (not, as some have here mistaken
it, an omer, which was but a tenth part of an ephah, [Exo
16:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#036).md), was valued at fifty shekels, a
moderate price ([Lev 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#016).md), and that
if it were sanctified immediately from the year of jubilee, [Lev
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#017.md). But, if some years after, there
was to be a discount accordingly, even of that price, [Lev
27:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#018). And, (2..md) When the value was
fixed, the donor might, if he pleased, redeem it for sixty shekels the
homer's sowing, which was with the addition of a fifth part: the money
then went to the sanctuary, and the land reverted to him that had
sanctified it, [Lev 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#019.md). But if he
would not redeem it, and the priest sold it to another, then at the year
of jubilee, beyond which the sale could not go, the land came to the
priests, and was theirs for ever, [Lev
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#020.md), [Lev
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#021.md). Note, What is given to the Lord
ought not to be given with a power of revocation; what is devoted to the
Lord must be his for ever, by a perpetual covenant.

2\. If the land was his own purchase, and came not to him from his
ancestors, then not the land itself, but the value of it was to be given
to the priests for pious uses, [Lev
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#022.md), [Lev
27:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#024.md). It was supposed that those who,
by the blessing of God, had grown so rich as to become purchasers would
think themselves obliged in gratitude to sanctify some part of their
purchase, at least (and here they are not limited, but they might, if
they pleased, sanctify the whole), to the service of God. For we ought
to give as God prospers us, [Co1 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#002.md).
Purchasers are in a special manner bound to be charitable. Now,
forasmuch as purchased lands were by a former law to return at the year
of jubilee to the family from which they were purchased, God would not
have that law and the intentions of it defeated by making the lands
corban, a gift, [Mar 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#011.md). But it was
to be computed how much the land was worth for so many years as were
from the vow to the jubilee; for only so long it was his own, and God
hates robbery for burnt-offerings. We can never acceptably serve God
with that of which we have wronged our neighbour. And so much money he
was to give for the present, and keep the land in his own hands till the
year of jubilee, when it was to return free of all encumbrances, even
that of its being dedicated to him of whom it was bought. The value of
the shekel by which all these estimations were to be made is here
ascertained ([Lev 27:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#025).md); it shall be
twenty gerahs, and every gerah was sixteen barley-corns. This was fixed
before ([Exo 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013).md); and, whereas
there had been some alterations, it is again fixed in the laws of
Ezekiel's visionary temple ([Eze
45:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#012).md), to denote that the gospel
should reduce things to their ancient standard.

[Leviticus 27:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">lev 27:26</span></span>

Here is, I. A caution given that no man should make such a jest of
sanctifying things to the Lord as to sanctify any firstling to him, for
that was his already by the law, [Lev
27:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#026.md). Though the matter of a general
vow be that which we were before obliged to, as of our sacramental
covenant, yet a singular vow should be of that which we were not, in
such circumstances and proportions, antecedently bound to. The law
concerning the firstlings of unclean beasts ([Lev
27:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#027).md) is the same with that before,
[Lev 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#011.md), [Lev
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#012.md).

II\. Things or persons devoted are here distinguished from things or
persons that were only sanctified. 1. Devoted things were most holy to
the Lord, and could neither revert nor be alienated, [Lev
27:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028.md). They were of the same nature
with those sacrifices which were called most holy, which none might
touch but only the priests themselves. The difference between these and
other sanctified things arose from the different expression of the vow.
If a man dedicated any thing to God, binding himself with a solemn curse
never to alienate it to any other purpose, then it was a thing devoted.
2. Devoted persons were to be put to death, [Lev
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#029.md). Not that it was in the power of
any parent or master thus to devote a child or a servant to death; but
it must be meant of the public enemies of Israel, who, either by the
appointment of God or by the sentence of the congregation, were devoted,
as the seven nations with which they must make no league. The city of
Jericho in particular was thus devoted, [Jos
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#017.md). The inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead
were put to death for violating the curse pronounced upon those who came
not up to Mizpeh, [Jdg 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#009.md), [Jdg
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#010.md). Some think it was for want of
being rightly informed of the true intent and meaning of this law that
Jephtha sacrificed his daughter as one devoted, who might not be
redeemed.

III\. A law concerning tithes, which were paid for the service of God
before the law, as appears by Abraham's payment of them, ([Gen
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#020).md), and Jacob's promise of them,
[Gen 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#022.md). It is here appointed, 1.
That they should pay tithe of all their increase, their corn, trees, and
cattle, [Lev 27:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030.md), [Lev
27:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#032.md). Whatsoever productions they had
the benefit of God must be honoured with the tithe of, if it were
titheable. Thus they acknowledged God to be the owner of their land, the
giver of its fruits, and themselves to be his tenants, and dependents
upon him. Thus they gave him thanks for the plenty they enjoyed, and
supplicated his favour in the continuance of it. And we are taught in
general to honour the Lord with our substance ([Pro
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#009).md), and in particular to support and
maintain his ministers, and to be ready to communicate to them, [Gal
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#006.md); [Co1
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#011.md). And how this may be done in a
fitter and more equal proportion than that of the tenth, which God
himself appointed of old, I cannot see. 2. That which was once marked
for tithe should not be altered, no, not for a better ([Lev
27:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#033).md), for Providence directed the
rod that marked it. God would accept it though it were not the best, and
they must not grudge it though it were, for it was what passed under the
rod. 3. That it should not be redeemed, unless the owner would give a
fifth part more for its ransom, [Lev
27:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#031.md). If men had the curiosity to
prefer what was marked for tithe before any other part of their
increase, it was fit that they should pay for their curiosity.

IV\. The last verse seems to have reference to this whole book of which
it is the conclusion: These are the commandments which the Lord
commanded Moses, for the children of Israel. Many of these commandments
are moral, and of perpetual obligation; others of them, which were
ceremonial and peculiar to the Jewish economy, have notwithstanding a
spiritual significancy, and are instructive to us who are furnished with
a key to let us into the mysteries contained in them; for unto us, by
those institutions, is the gospel preached as well as unto them, [Heb
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#002.md). Upon the whole matter, we may see
cause to bless God that we have not come to mount Sinai, [Heb
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#018.md). 1. That we are not under the
dark shadows of the law, but enjoy the clear light of the gospel, which
shows us Christ the end of the law for righteousness, [Rom
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004.md). The doctrine of our
reconciliation to God by a Mediator is not clouded with the smoke of
burning sacrifices, but cleared by the knowledge of Christ and him
crucified. 2. That we are not under the heavy yoke of the law, and the
carnal ordinances of it (as the apostle calls them, [Heb
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010).md), imposed till the time of
reformation, a yoke which neither they nor their fathers were able to
bear ([Act 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010).md), but under the sweet
and easy institutions of the gospel, which pronounces those the true
worshippers that worship the Father in spirit and truth, by Christ only,
and in his name, who is our priest, temple, altar, sacrifice,
purification, and all. Let us not therefore think that because we are
not tied to the ceremonial cleansings, feasts, and oblations, a little
care, time, and expense, will serve to honour God with. No, but rather
have our hearts more enlarge with free-will offerings to his praise,
more inflamed with holy love and joy, and more engaged in seriousness of
thought and sincerity of intention. Having boldness to enter into the
holiest by the blood of Jesus, let us draw near with a true heart, and
full assurance of faith, worshipping God with so much the more
cheerfulness and humble confidence, still saying, Blessed be God for
Jesus Christ!
