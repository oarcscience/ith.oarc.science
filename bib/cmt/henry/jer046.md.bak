### [Jeremiah Chapter 46](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 46:0</span></span>

How judgment began at the house of God we have found in the foregoing
prophecy and history; but now we shall find that it did not end there.
In this and the following chapters we have predictions of the
desolations of the neighbouring nations, and those brought upon them too
mostly by the king of Babylon, till at length Babylon itself comes to be
reckoned with. The prophecy against Egypt is here put first and takes up
this whole chapter, in which we have, I. A prophecy of the defeat of
Pharaoh-necho's army by the Chaldean forces at Carchemish, which was
accomplished soon after, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim ([Jer
46:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#001).md) II. A prophecy of the descent
which Nebuchadnezzar should make upon the land of Egypt, and his success
in it, which was accomplished some years after the destruction of
Jerusalem ([Jer 46:13-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#013).md). III. A word
of comfort to the Israel of God in the midst of those calamities ([Jer
46:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#027.md), [Jer
46:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#028).md).

[Jeremiah 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 46:1</span></span>

The first verse is the title of that part of this book, which relates to
the neighbouring nations, and follows here. It is the word of the Lord
which came to Jeremiah against the Gentiles; for God is King and Judge
of nations, knows and will call to an account those who know him not nor
take any notice of him. Both Isaiah and Ezekiel prophesied against these
nations that Jeremiah here has a separate saying to, and with reference
to the same events. In the Old Testament we have the word of the Lord
against the Gentiles; in the New Testament we have the word of the Lord
for the Gentiles, that those who were afar off are made nigh.

He begins with Egypt, because they were of old Israel's oppressors and
of late their deceivers, when they put confidence in them. In these
verses he foretells the overthrow of the army of Pharaoh-necho, by
Nebuchadnezzar, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, which was so complete a
victory to the king of Babylon that thereby he recovered from the river
of Egypt to the river Euphrates, all that pertained to the king of
Egypt, and so weakened him that he came not again any more out of his
land (as we find, [Kg2 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007).md), and so
made him pay dearly for his expedition against the king of Assyria four
years before, in which he slew Josiah, [Kg2
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029.md). This is the event that is here
foretold in lofty expressions of triumph over Egypt thus foiled, which
Jeremiah would speak of with a particular pleasure, because the death of
Josiah, which he had lamented, was now avenged on Pharaoh-necho. Now
here,

I. The Egyptians are upbraided with the mighty preparations they made
for this expedition, in which the prophet calls to them to do their
utmost, for so they would: "Come then, order the buckler, let the
weapons of war be got ready," [Jer
46:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#003.md). Egypt was famous for horses -
let them be harnessed and the cavalry well mounted: Get up, you
horsemen, and stand forth, etc., [Jer
46:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#004.md). See what preparations the
children of men make, with abundance of care and trouble and at a vast
expense, to kill one another, as if they did not die fast enough of
themselves. He compares their marching out upon this expedition to the
rising of their river Nile ([Jer 46:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#007.md),
[Jer 46:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#008).md): Egypt now rises up like a
flood, scorning to keep within its own banks and threatening to overflow
all the neighbouring lands. It is a very formidable army that the
Egyptians bring into the field upon this occasion. The prophet summons
them ([Jer 46:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#009).md): Come up, you horses;
rage, you chariots. He challenges them to bring all their confederate
troops together, the Ethiopians, that descended from the same stock with
the Egyptians ([Gen 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#006).md), and were
their neighbours and allies, the Libyans and Lydians, both seated in
Africa, to the west of Egypt, and from them the Egyptians fetched their
auxiliary forces. Let them strengthen themselves with all the art and
interest they have, yet it shall be all in vain; they shall be
shamefully defeated notwithstanding, for God will fight against them,
and against him there is no wisdom nor counsel, [Pro
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#030.md), [Pro
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#031.md). It concerns those that go forth
to war not only to order the buckler, and harness the horses, but to
repent of their sins, and pray to God for his presence with them, and
that they may have it to keep themselves from every wicked thing.

II\. They are upbraided with the great expectations they had from this
expedition, which were quite contrary to what God intended in bringing
them together. They knew their own thoughts, and God knew them, and sat
in heaven and laughed at them,; but they knew not the thoughts of the
Lord, for he gathers them as sheaves into the floor, [Mic
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011.md), [Mic
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#012.md). Egypt saith ([Jer
46:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#008).md): I will go up; I will cover the
earth, and none shall hinder me; I will destroy the city, whatever city
it is that stands in my way. Like Pharaoh of old, I will pursue, I will
overtake. The Egyptians say that they shall have a day of it, but God
saith that it shall be his day: The is the day of the Lord God of hosts
([Jer 46:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#010).md), the day in which he will
be exalted in the overthrow of the Egyptians. They meant one thing, but
God meant another; they designed it for the advancement of their dignity
and the enlargement of their dominion, but God designed it for the great
abasement and weakening of their kingdom. It is a day of vengeance for
Josiah's death; it is a day of sacrifice to divine justice, to which
multitudes of the sinners of Egypt shall fall as victims. Note, When men
think to magnify themselves by pushing on unrighteous enterprises, let
them expect that God will glorify himself by blasting them and cutting
them off.

III\. They are upbraided with their cowardice and inglorious flight when
they come to an engagement ([Jer 46:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#005.md),
[Jer 46:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#006).md): "Wherefore have I seen
them, notwithstanding all these mighty and vast preparations and all
these expressions of bravery and resolution, when the Chaldean army
faces them, dismayed, turned back, quite disheartened, and no spirit
left in them." 1. They make a shameful retreat. Even their mighty ones,
who, one would think, should have stood their ground, flee a flight,
flee by consent, make the best of their way, flee in confusion and with
the utmost precipitation; they have neither time nor heart to look back,
but fear is round about them, for they apprehend it so. And yet, 2. They
cannot make their escape. They have the shame of flying, and yet not the
satisfaction of saving themselves by flight; they might as well have
stood their ground and died upon the spot; for even the swift shall not
flee away. The lightness of their heels shall fail them when it comes to
the trial, as well as the stoutness of their hearts; the mighty shall
not escape, nay, they are beaten down and broken to pieces. They shall
stumble in their flight, and fall towards the north, towards their
enemy's country; for such confusion were they in when they took to their
feet that instead of making homeward, as men usually do in that case,
they made forward. Note, The race is not to the swift nor the battle to
the strong. Valiant men are not always victorious.

IV\. They are upbraided with their utter inability ever to recover this
blow, which should be fatal to their nation, [Jer
46:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#011.md), [Jer
46:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#012.md). The damsel, the daughter of
Egypt, that lived in great pomp and state, is sorely wounded by this
defeat. Let her now seek for balm in Gilead and physicians there; let
her use all the medicines her wise men can prescribe for the healing of
this hurt, and the repairing of the loss sustained by this defeat; but
all in vain; no cure shall be to them; they shall never be able to bring
such a powerful army as this into the field again. "The nations that
rang of thy glory and strength have now heard of thy shame, how
shamefully thou wast routed and how thou are weakened by it." It needs
not be spread by the triumphs of the conquerors, the shrieks and
outcries of the conquered will proclaim it: Thy cry hath filled the
country about. For, when they fled several ways, one mighty man stumbled
upon another and dashed against another, such confusion were they in, so
that both together became a pray to the pursuers, an easy prey. A
thousand such dreadful accidents there should be, which should fill the
country with the cry of those that were overcome. Let not the mighty man
therefore glory in his might, for the time may come when it will stand
him in no stead.

[Jeremiah 46:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 46:13</span></span>

In these verses we have,

I. Confusion and terror spoken to Egypt. The accomplishment of the
prediction in the former part of the chapter disabled the Egyptians from
making any attempts upon other nations; for what could they do when
their army was routed? But still they remained strong at home, and none
of their neighbours durst make any attempts upon them. Though the kings
of Egypt came no more out of their land ([Kg2
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007).md), yet they kept safe and easy in
their land; and what would they desire more than peaceably to enjoy
their own? One would think all men should be content to do this, and not
covet to invade their neighbours. But the measure of Egypt's iniquity is
full, and now they shall not long enjoy their own; those that encroached
on others shall not be themselves encroached on. The scope of the
prophecy here is to show how the king of Babylon should shortly come and
smite the land of Egypt, and bring the war into their own bosoms which
they had formerly carried into his borders, [Jer
46:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#013.md). This was fulfilled by the same
hand with the former, even Nebuchadnezzar's, but many years after,
twenty at least, and probably the prediction of it was long after the
former prediction, and perhaps much about the same time with that other
prediction of the same event which we had [Jer
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#010.md).

1\. Here is the alarm of war sounded in Egypt, to their great amazement
([Jer 46:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#014).md), notice given to the
country that the enemy is approaching, the sword is devouring round
about in the neighbouring countries, and therefore it is time for the
Egyptians to put themselves in a posture of defence, to prepare for war,
that they may give the enemy a warm reception. This must be proclaimed
in all parts of Egypt, particularly in Migdol, Noph, and Tahpanhes,
because in these places especially the Jewish refugees, or fugitives
rather, had planted themselves, in contempt of God's command ([Jer
44:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#001).md), and let them hear what a sorry
shelter Egypt is likely to be to them.

2\. The retreat hereupon of the forces of other nations which the
Egyptians had in their pay is here foretold. Some considerable number of
those troops, it is probable, were posted upon the frontiers to guard
them, where they were beaten off by the invaders and put to flights.
Then were the valiant men swept away ([Jer
46:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#015).md) as with a sweeping rain (it is
the word that is used [Pro 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#003).md); they
can none of them stand their ground, because the Lord drives them from
their respective posts; he drives them by his terrors; he drives them by
enabling the Chaldeans to drive them. It is not possible that those
should fix whom the wrath of God chases. He it was ([Jer
46:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#016).md) that made many to fall, yea,
when their day shall come to fall, the enemy needs not throw them down,
they shall fall one upon another, every man shall be a stumbling-block
to his fellow, to his follower; nay, if God please, they shall be made
to fall upon one another, they shall be made to fall upon one another,
every man's sword shall be against his fellow. Her hired men, the troops
Egypt has in he service, are indeed in the midst of her like fatted
bullocks, lusty men, able bodied and high spirited, who were likely for
action and promised to make their part good against the enemy; but they
are turned back; their hearts failed them, and, instead of fighting,
they have fled away together. How could they withstand their fate when
the day of their calamity had come, the day in which God will visit them
in wrath? Some think they are compared to fatted bullocks for their
luxury; they had wantoned in pleasures, so that they were very unfit for
hardships, and therefore turned back and could not stand. In this
consternation, (1.) They all made homeward towards their own country
([Jer 46:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#016).md): They said, "Arise, and
let us go again to our own people, where we may be safe from the
oppressing sword of the Chaldeans, that bears down all before it." In
times of exigence little confidence is to be put in mercenary troops,
that fight purely for pay, and have no interest in theirs whom they
fight for. (2.) They exclaimed vehemently against Pharaoh, to whose
cowardice or bad management, it is probably, their defeat was owing.
When he posted them there upon the borders of his country it is probably
that he told them he would within such a time come himself with a
gallant army of his own subjects to support them; but he failed them,
and, when the enemy advanced, they found they had none to back them, so
that they were perfectly abandoned to the fury of the invaders. No
marvel then that they quitted their post and deserted the service,
crying out, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise ([Jer
46:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#017).md); he can hector, and talk big of
the mighty things he would do, but that is all; he brings nothing to
pass. All his promises to those in alliance with him, or that are
employed for him, vanish into smoke. He brings not the succours he
engaged to bring, or not till it is too late: He has passed the time
appointed; he did not keep his word, nor keep his day, and therefore
they bid him farewell, they will never serve under him any more. Note,
Those that make most noise in any business are frequently but a noise.
Great talkers are little doers.

3\. The formidable power of the Chaldean army is here described as
bearing down all before it. The King of kings, whose name is the Lord of
hosts, and before whom the mightiest kings on earth, though gods to us,
are but as grasshoppers, he hath said it, he hath sworn it, As I live,
saith this king, as Tabor overtops the mountains and Carmel overlooks
the sea, so shall the king of Babylon overpower all the force of Egypt,
such a command shall he have, such a sway shall he bear, [Jer
46:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#018.md). He and his army shall come
against Egypt with axes, as hewers of wood ([Jer
46:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#022).md), and the Egyptians shall be no
more able to resist them than the tree is to resist the man that comes
with an axe to cut it down; so that Egypt shall be felled as a forest is
by the hewers of wood, which (if there by many of them, and those well
provided with instruments for the purpose) will be done in a little
time. Egypt is very populous, full of towns and cities, like a forest,
the trees of which cannot be searched or numbered, and very rich, full
of hidden treasures, many of which will escape the searching eye of the
Chaldean soldiers; but they shall make a great spoil in the country, for
they are more than the locusts, that come in vast swarms and overrun a
country, devouring every green thing ([Joe
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#006.md), [Joe
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#007).md), so shall the Chaldeans do, for
they are innumerable. Note, The Lord of hosts hath numberless hosts at
his command.

4\. The desolation of Egypt hereby is foretold, and the waste that
should be made of that rich country. Egypt is now like a very fair
heifer, or calf ([Jer 46:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#020).md), fat and
shining, and not accustomed to the yoke of subjection, wanton as a
heifer that is well fed, and very sportful. Some think here is an
allusion to Apis, the bull or calf which the Egyptians worshipped, from
whom the children of Israel learned to worship the golden calf. Egypt is
as fair as a goddess, and adores herself, but destruction comes; cutting
up comes (so some read it); it comes out of the north; thence the
Chaldean soldiers shall come, as so many butchers or sacrificers, to
kill and cut up this fair heifer. (1.) The Egyptians shall be brought
down, shall be tamed, and their tune changed: The daughters of Egypt
shall be confounded ([Jer 46:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#024).md),
shall be filled with astonishment. Their voice shall go like a serpent,
that is, it shall be very low and submissive; they shall not low like a
fair heifer, that makes a great noise, but hiss out of their holes like
serpents. They shall not dare to make loud complaints of the cruelty of
the conquerors, but vent their griefs in silent murmurs. They shall not
now, as they used to do, answer roughly, but, with the poor, use
entreaties and beg for their lives. (2.) They shall be carried away
prisoners into their enemy's land ([Jer
46:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#019).md): "O thou daughter! dwelling
securely and delicately in Egypt, that fruitful pleasant country, do not
think this will last always, but furnish thyself to go into captivity;
instead of rich clothes, which will but tempt the enemy to strip thee,
get plain and warm clothes; instead of fine shoes, provide strong ones;
and inure thyself to hardship, that thou mayest bear it the better."
Note, It concerns us, among all our preparations, to prepare for
trouble. We provide for the entertainment of our friends, let us not
neglect to provide for the entertainment of our enemies, nor among all
our furniture omit furniture for captivity. The Egyptians must prepare
to flee; for their cities shall be evacuated. Noph particularly shall be
desolate, without an inhabitant, so general shall the slaughter and the
captivity be. There are some penalties which, we say, the king and the
multitude are exempted from, but here even these are obnoxious: The
multitude of No shall be punished: it is called populous No, [Nah
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008.md). Though hand join in hand, yet
they shall not escape; nor can any think to go off in the crowd. Be they
ever so many, they shall find God will be too many for them. Their kings
and all their petty princes shall fall; and their gods too ([Jer
43:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#012.md), [Jer
43:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#013).md), their idols and their great
men. Those which they call their tutelar deities shall be no protection
to them. Pharaoh shall be brought down, and all those that trust in him
([Jer 46:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#025).md), particularly the Jews
that came to sojourn in his country, trusting in him rather than in God.
All these shall be delivered into the hands of the northern nations
([Jer 46:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#024).md), into the hand not only
of Nebuchadnezzar that mighty potentate, but into the hands of his
servants, according to the curse on Ham's posterity, of which the
Egyptians were, that they should be the servants of servants. These seek
their lives, and into their hands they shall be delivered.

5\. An intimation is given that in process of time Egypt shall recover
itself again ([Jer 46:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#026).md): Afterwards
it shall be inhabited, shall be peopled again, whereas by this
destruction it was almost dispeopled. Ezekiel foretels that this should
be at the end of forty years, [Eze
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#013.md). See what changes the nations of
the earth are subject to, how they are emptied and increased again; and
let not nations that prosper be secure, nor those that for the present
are in thraldom despair.

II\. Comfort and peace are here spoken to the Israel of God, [Jer
46:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#027.md), [Jer
46:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#028.md). Some understand it of those
whom the king of Egypt had carried into captivity with Jehoahaz, but we
read not of any that were carried away captives with him; it may
therefore rather refer to the captives in Babylon, whom God had mercy in
store for, or, more generally, to all the people of God, designed for
their encouragement in the most difficult times, when the judgments of
God are abroad among the nations. We had these words of comfort before,
[Jer 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#010.md), [Jer
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#011.md). 1. Let the wicked of the earth
tremble, they have cause for it; but fear not thou, O my servant Jacob!
and be not dismayed, O Israel! and again, Fear thou not, O Jacob! God
would not have his people to be a timorous people. 2. The wicked of the
earth shall be put away like dross, not be looked after any more; but
God's people, in order to their being saved, shall be found out and
gathered though they be far off, shall be redeemed though they be held
fast in captivity, and shall return. 3. The wicked is like the troubled
sea when it cannot rest; they flee when none pursues. But Jacob, being
at home in God, shall be at rest and at ease, and none shall make him
afraid; for what time he is afraid he has a God to trust to. 4. The
wicked God beholds afar off; but, wherever thou art, O Jacob! I am with
thee, a very present help. 5. A full end shall be made of the nations
that oppressed God's Israel, as Egypt and Babylon; but mercy shall be
kept in store for the Israel of God: they shall be corrected, but not
cast off; the correction shall be in measure, in respect of degree and
continuance. Nations have their periods; the Jewish nation itself has
come to an end as a nation; but the gospel church, God's spiritual
Israel, still continues, and will to the end of time; in that this
promise is to have its full accomplishment, that, though God correct it,
he will never make a full end of it.
