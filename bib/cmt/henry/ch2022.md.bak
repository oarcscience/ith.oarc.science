### [2 Chronicles Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 22:0</span></span>

We read, in the foregoing chapter, of the carrying away of Jehoram's
sons and his wives; but here we find one of his sons and one of his
wives left, his son Ahaziah and his wife Athaliah, both reserved to be
the shame and plague of his family. I. Ahaziah was the shame of it as a
partaker, 1. In the sin, and, 2. In the destruction, of the house of
Ahab ([Ch2 22:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001).md). II. Athaliah was
the plague of it, for she destroyed all the seed-royal, and usurped the
throne ([Ch2 22:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#010).md).

[2 Chronicles 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 22:1</span></span>

We have here an account of the reign of Ahaziah, a short reign (of one
year only), yet long enough, unless it had been better. He was called
Jeho-ahaz ([Ch2 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#017).md); here he is
called Ahaz-iah, which is the same name and of the same signification,
only the words of which it is compounded are transposed. He is here said
to be forty-two years old when he began to reign ([Ch2
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#002).md), which could not be, for his
father, his immediate predecessor, was but forty when he died, and it is
said ([Kg2 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#026).md) that he was
twenty-two years old when he began to reign. Some make this forty-two to
be the age of his mother Athaliah, for in the original it is, he was the
son of forty-two years, that is, the son of a mother that was of that
age; and justly is her age put for his, in reproach to him, because she
managed him, and did what she would - she, in effect, reigned, and he
had little more than the title of king. Many good expositors are ready
to allow that this, with some few more such difficulties, arise from the
mistake of some transcriber, who put forty-two for twenty-two, and the
copies by which the error should have been corrected might be lost. Many
ancient translations read it here twenty-two. Few books are now printed
without some errata, yet the authors do not therefore disown them, nor
are the errors of the press imputed to the author, but the candid reader
amends them by the sense, or by comparing them with some other part of
the work, as we may easily do this.

The history of Ahaziah's reign is briefly summed up in two clauses, [Ch2
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#003.md), [Ch2
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#004.md). His mother and her relations
were his counselors to do wickedly, and it was to his destruction.

I. He did wickedly. Though by a special providence of God he was
preserved alive, when all his brethren were slain, and reserved for the
crown, notwithstanding he was the youngest of them - though the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, when they had buried his father ingloriously,
made him king, in hopes he would take warning by that not to tread in
his steps, but would do better for himself and his kingdom - yet he was
not influenced by the favours either of God or man, but walked in the
way of the house of Ahab, did evil in the sight of the Lord like them
([Ch2 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#003.md), [Ch2
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#004).md), that is, he worshipped, Baalim
and Ashtaroth, supposing (as the learned bishop Patrick thinks) that by
these demons, as mediators, they might have easier access to the supreme
Numen, the God of Israel, or that these they might resort to at all
times and for all matters, as being nearer at hand, and not of so high a
dignity, but of a middle nature between the immortal God and mortal men
- deified heroes; so they worshipped them as the church of Rome does
saints and angels. That was sufficiently bad; but I wish there was no
reason to suspect worse. I am apprehensive that they looked upon
Jehovah, the God of their fathers, to be altogether such a one as these
Baalim, and them to be as great and as good as he, nay, upon one
account, more eligible inasmuch as these Baalim encouraged in their
worshippers all manner of lewdness and sensuality, which the God of
Israel strictly forbade.

II\. He was counselled by his mother and her relations to do so. She was
his counsellor ([Ch2 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#003).md) and so were
they, after the death of his father, [Ch2
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#004.md). While his father lived he took
care to keep him to idolatry; but, when he was dead, the house of Ahab
feared lest his father's miserable end should deter him from it, and
therefore they were very industrious to keep him closely to it, and to
make him seven times more a child of hell than themselves. The counsel
of the ungodly is the ruin of many young persons when they are setting
out in the world. This young prince might have had better advice if he
had pleased from the princes and the judges, the priests and the
Levites, that had been famous in his good grandfather's time for
teaching in the knowledge of God; but the house of Ahab humoured him,
and he walked after their counsel, gave himself up to be led by them,
and did just as they would have him. Thus do those debase and destroy
themselves that forsake the divine guidance.

III\. He was counselled by them to his destruction. So it proved. Those
that counsel us to do wickedly counsel us to our destruction; while they
fawn, and flatter, and pretend friendship, they are really our worst
enemies. Those that debauch young men destroy them. It was bad enough
that they exposed him to the sword of the Syrians, drawing him in to
join with Joram king of Israel in an expedition to Ramoth-Gilead, where
Joram was wounded, an expedition that was not for his honour. Those that
give us bad counsel in the affairs of religion, if regarded by us, may
justly be made of God our counsellors to do foolishly in our own
affairs. But that was not all: by engaging him in an intimacy with Joram
king of Israel, they involved him in the common ruin of the house of
Ahab. He came on a visit to Joram ([Ch2
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#006).md) just at the time that Jehu was
executing the judgment of God upon that idolatrous family, and so was
cut off with them, [Ch2 22:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#007.md). Here,
1. See and dread the mischief of bad company - of joining in with
sinners. If not the infection, yet let the destruction be feared. Come
out from Babylon, that falling house, [Rev
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004.md). 2. See and acknowledge the
justice of God. His providence brought Ahaziah, just at this fatal
juncture, to see Joram, that he might fall with him and be taken as in a
snare. This we had an account of before, [Kg2
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#027.md), [Kg2
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#028.md). It is here added that he was
decently buried (not as Jehoram, whose dead body was cast into Naboth's
vineyard, [Kg2 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#026).md), and the reason
given is because he was the son (that is, the grandson) of good
Jehoshaphat, who sought the Lord with his heart. Thus is he remembered
with honour long after his death, and some respect shown even to his
degenerate unworthy seed for his sake. The memory of the just is
blessed, but the name of the wicked shall rot.

[2 Chronicles 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 22:10</span></span>

We have here what we had before, [Kg2
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#001.md), etc. 1. A wicked woman
endeavouring to destroy the house of David, that she might set up a
throne for herself upon the ruins of it. Athaliah barbarously cut off
all the seed-royal ([Ch2 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#010).md),
perhaps intending to transmit the crown of Judah after herself to some
of her own relations, that though her family was cut off in Israel by
Jehu it might be planted in Judah. 2. A good woman effectually
preserving it from being wholly extirpated. One of the late king's sons,
a child of a year old, was rescued from among the dead, and saved alive
by the care of Jehoiada's wife ([Ch2
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#011.md), [Ch2
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#012).md), that a lamp might be ordained
for God's anointed; for no word of God shall fall to the ground.
