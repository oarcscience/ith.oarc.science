### [Ruth Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001.md)

[Ruth](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rut 4:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have the wedding between Boaz and Ruth, in the
circumstances of which there was something uncommon, which is kept upon
record for the illustration, not only of the law concerning the marrying
of a brother's widow ([Deu 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005.md),
etc.), for cases help to expound laws, but of the gospel too, for from
this marriage descended David, and the Son of David, whose espousals to
the Gentile church were hereby typified. We are here told, I. How Boaz
got clear of his rival, and fairly shook him off ([Rut
4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001).md). II. How his marriage with Ruth
was publicly solemnized, and attended with the good wishes of his
neighbours ([Rut 4:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#009).md). III. The
happy issue that descended from this marriage, Obed, the grandfather of
David ([Rut 4:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#013).md). And so the book
concludes with the pedigree of David ([Rut
4:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#018).md). Perhaps it was to oblige him
that the blessed Spirit directed the inserting of this story in the
sacred canon, he being desirous that the virtues of his
great-grandmother Ruth, together with her Gentile extraction and the
singular providences that attended her, should be transmitted to
posterity.

[Ruth 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rut 4:1</span></span>

Here, 1. Boaz calls a court immediately. It is probable he was himself
one of the elders (or aldermen) of the city; for he was a mighty man of
wealth. Perhaps he was father of the city, and sat chief; for he seems
here to have gone up to the gate as one having authority, and not as a
common person; like Job, [Job 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#007.md),
etc. We cannot suppose him less than a magistrate in his city who was
grandson to Nahshon, prince of Judah; and his lying at the end of a heap
of corn in the threshing-floor the night before was not at all
inconsistent, in those days of plainness, with the honour of his sitting
judge in the gate. But why was Boaz so hasty, why so fond of the match?
Ruth was not rich, but lived upon alms; not honourable, but a poor
stranger. She was never said to be beautiful; if ever she had been so,
we may suppose that weeping, and travelling, and gleaning, had withered
her lilies and roses. But that which made Boaz in love with her, and
solicitous to expedite the affair, was that all her neighbours agreed
she was a virtuous woman. This set her price with him far above rubies
([Pro 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#010).md); and therefore he thinks,
if by marrying her he might do her a real kindness, he should also do
himself a very great kindness. He will therefore bring it to a
conclusion immediately. It was not court-day, but he got ten men of the
elders of the city to meet him in the town-hall over the gate, where
public business used to be transacted, [Rut
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#002.md). So many, it is probable, by the
custom of the city, made a full court. Boaz, though a judge, would not
be judge in his own cause, but desired the concurrence of other elders.
Honest intentions dread not a public cognizance. 2. He summons his rival
to come and hear the matter that was to be proposed to him ([Rut
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001).md): "Ho, such a one, sit down here."
He called him by his name, no doubt, but the divine historian thought
not fit to record it, for, because he refused to raise up the name of
the dead, he deserved not to have his name preserved to future ages in
this history. Providence favoured Boaz in ordering it so that this
kinsman should come by thus opportunely, just when the matter was ready
to be proposed to him. Great affairs are sometimes much furthered by
small circumstances, which facilitate and expedite them. 3. He proposes
to the other kinsman the redemption of Naomi's land, which, it is
probable, had been mortgaged for money to buy bread with when the famine
was in the land ([Rut 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#003).md): "Naomi has
a parcel of land to sell, namely, the equity of the redemption of it out
of the hands of the mortgagee, which she is willing to part with;" or,
as some think, it was her jointure for her life, and, wanting money, for
a small matter she would sell her interest to the heir at law, who was
fittest to be the purchaser. This he gives the kinsman legal notice of
([Rut 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#004).md), that he might have the
refusal of it. Whoever had it must pay for it, and Boaz might have said,
"My money is as good as my kinsman's; if I have a mind to it, why may
not I buy it privately, since I had the first proffer of it, and say
nothing to my kinsman?" No, Boaz, though fond enough of the purchase,
would not do so mean a thing as to take a bargain over another man's
head that was nearer a-kin to it; and we are taught by his example to be
not only just and honest, but fair and honourable, in all our dealings,
and to do nothing which we are unwilling should see the light, but be
above-board. 4. The kinsman seemed forward to redeem the land till he
was told that, if he did that, he must marry the widow, and then he flew
off. He liked the land well enough, and probably caught at that the more
greedily because he hoped that the poor widow being under a necessity of
selling he have so much the better bargain: "I will redeem it" (said he)
"with all my heart," thinking it would be a fine addition to his estate,
[Rut 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#004.md). But Boaz told him there was
a young widow in the case, and, if he have the land, he must take her
with it, Terra transit cum onere - The estate passes with this
incumbrance; either the divine law or the usage of the country would
oblige him to it, or Naomi insisted upon it that she would not sell the
land but upon this condition, [Rut
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#005.md). Some think this does not relate
to the law of marrying the brother's widow (for that seems to oblige
only the children of the same father, [Deu
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005.md), unless by custom it was
afterwards made to extend to the next of kin), but to the law of
redemption of inheritances ([Lev
25:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#024.md), [Lev
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#025).md), for it is a Goel, a redeemer,
that is here enquired for; and if so it was not by the law, but by
Naomi's own resolution, that the purchaser was to marry the widow.
However it was, this kinsman, when he heard the conditions of the
bargain, refused it ([Rut 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#006).md): "I
cannot redeem it for myself. I will not meddle with it upon these terms,
lest I mar my own inheritance." The land, he thought, would be an
improvement of his inheritance, but not the land with the woman; that
would mar it. Perhaps he thought it would be a disparagement to him to
marry such a poor widow that had come from a strange country, and almost
lived upon alms. He fancied it would be a blemish to his family, it
would mar his blood, and disgrace his posterity. Her eminent virtues
were not sufficient in his eye to counterbalance this. The Chaldee
paraphrase makes his reason for this refusal to be that he had another
wife, and, if he should take Ruth, it might occasion strife and
contention in his family, which would mar the comfort of his
inheritance. Or he thought she might bring him a great many children,
and they would all expect shares out of his estate, which would scatter
it into too many hands, so that the family would make the less figure.
This makes many shy of the great redemption: they are not willing to
espouse religion. They have heard well of it, and have nothing to say
against it; they will give it their good word, but at the same time they
will give their good word with it; they are willing to part with it, and
cannot be bound to it, for fear of marring their own inheritance in this
world. Heaven they could be glad of, but holiness they can dispense
with; it will not agree with the lusts they have already espoused, and
therefore, let who will purchase heaven at that rate, they cannot. 5.
The right of redemption is fairly resigned to Boaz. If this nameless
kinsman lost a good bargain, a good estate, and a good wife too, he may
thank himself for not considering it better, and Boaz will thank him for
making his way clear to that which he valued and desired above any
thing. In those ancient times it was not the usage to pass estates by
writings, as afterwards ([Jer 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#010.md),
etc.), but by some sign or ceremony, as with us by livery and seisin, as
we commonly call it, that is, the delivery of seisin, seisin of a house
by giving the key, of land by giving turf and a twig. The ceremony here
used was, he that surrendered plucked off his shoe (the Chaldee says it
was the glove of his right hand) and gave it to him to whom he made the
surrender, intimating thereby that, whatever right he had to tread or go
upon the land, he conveyed and transferred it, upon a valuable
consideration, to the purchaser: this was a testimony in Israel, [Rut
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#007.md). And it was done in this case,
[Rut 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#008.md). If this kinsman had been
bound by the law to marry Ruth, and his refusal had been a contempt of
that law, Ruth must have plucked off his shoe and spit in his face, [Deu
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#009.md). But, though his relation should
in some measure oblige him to the duty, yet the distance of his relation
might serve to excuse him from the penalty, or Ruth might very well
dispense with it, since his refusal was all she desired from him. But
bishop Patrick, and the best interpreters, think this had no relation to
that law, and that the drawing off of the shoe was not any disgrace as
there, but a confirmation of the surrender, and an evidence that it was
not fraudulently nor surreptitiously obtained. Note, Fair and open
dealing in all matters of contract and commerce is what all those must
make conscience of that would approve themselves Israelites indeed,
without guile. How much more honourably and honestly does Boaz come by
this purchase than if he had secretly undermined his kinsman, and
privately struck up a bargain with Naomi, unknown to him. Honesty will
be found the best policy.

[Ruth 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rut 4:9</span></span>

Boaz now sees his way clear, and therefore delays not to perform his
promise made to Ruth that he would do the kinsman's part, but in the
gate of the city, before the elders and all the people, publishes a
marriage-contract between himself and Ruth the Moabitess, and therewith
the purchase of all the estate that belonged to the family of Elimelech.
If he had not been ([Rut 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#001).md) a mighty
man of wealth, he could not have compassed this redemption, nor done
this service to his kinsman's family. What is a great estate good for,
but that it enables a man to do so much the more good in his generation,
and especially to those of his own household, if he have but a heart to
use it so! Now concerning this marriage it appears,

I. That it was solemnized, or at least published, before many witnesses,
[Rut 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#009.md), [Rut
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#010.md). "You are witnesses," 1. "That I
have bought the estate. Whoever has it, or any part of it, mortgaged to
him, let him come to me and he shall have his money, according to the
value of the land," which was computed by the number of years to the
year of jubilee ([Lev 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#015).md), when it
would have returned of course to Elimelech's family. The more public the
sales of estates are the better they are guarded against frauds. 2.
"That I have purchased the widow to be my wife." He had no portion with
her; what jointure she had was encumbered, and he could not have it
without giving as much for it as it was worth, and therefore he might
well say he purchased her; and yet, being a virtuous woman, he reckoned
he had a good bargain. House and riches are the inheritance of fathers,
but a prudent wife is more valuable, is from the Lord as a special gift.
He designed, in marrying her, to preserve the memory of the dead, that
the name of Mahlon, though he left no son to bear it up, might not be
cut off from the gate of his place, but by this means might be
preserved, that it should be inserted in the public register that Boaz
married Ruth the widow of Mahlon, the son of Elimelech, which posterity,
whenever they had occasion to consult the register, would take
particular notice of. And this history, being preserved for the sake of
that marriage and the issue of it, proved an effectual means to
perpetuate the name of Mahlon, even beyond the thought or intention of
Boaz, to the world's end. And observe that because Boaz did this honour
to the dead, as well as this kindness to the living, God did him the
honour to bring him into the genealogy of the Messiah, by which his
family was dignified above all the families of Israel; while the other
kinsman, that was so much afraid of diminishing himself, and marring his
inheritance, by marrying the widow, has his name, family, and
inheritance, buried in oblivion and disgrace. A tender and generous
concern for the honour of the dead and the comfort of poor widows and
strangers, neither of which can return the kindness ([Luk
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#014).md), is sure what God will be well
pleased with and will surely recompense. Our Lord Jesus is our Goel, our
Redeemer, our everlasting Redeemer. He looked, like Boaz, with
compassion on the deplorable state of fallen mankind. At a vast expense
he redeemed the heavenly inheritance for us, which by sin was mortgaged,
and forfeited into the hands of divine justice, and which we should
never have been able to redeem. He likewise purchased a peculiar people,
whom he would espouse to himself, though strangers and foreigners, like
Ruth, poor and despised, that the name of that dead and buried race
might not be cut off for ever. He ventured the marring of his own
inheritance, to do this, for, though he was rich, yet for our sakes he
became poor; but he was abundantly recompensed for it by his Father,
who, because he thus humbled himself, hath highly exalted him, and given
him a name above every name. Let us own our obligations to him, make
sure our contract with him, and study all our days how to do him honour.
Boaz, by making a public declaration of this marriage and purchase, not
only secured his title against all pretenders, as it were by a fine with
proclamations, but put honour upon Ruth, showed that he was not ashamed
of her, and her parentage and poverty, and left a testimony against
clandestine marriages. It is only that which is evil that hates the
light and comes not to it. Boaz called witnesses to what he did, for it
was what he could justify, and would never disown; and such regard was
then had, even to the contemned crowd, that not only the elders, but all
the people that were in the gate, passing and re-passing, were appealed
to ([Rut 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#009).md), and hearkened to ([Rut
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#011).md) when they said, We are
witnesses.

II\. That it was attended with many prayers. The elders and all the
people, when they witnessed to it, wished well to it, and blessed it,
[Rut 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#011.md), [Rut
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#012.md). Ruth, it should seem, was now
sent for; for they speak of her ([Rut
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#012).md) as present: This young woman;
and, he having taken her to wife, they look upon her as already come
into his house. And very heartily they pray for the new-married couple.

1\. The senior elder, it is likely, made this prayer, and the rest of
the elders, with the people, joined in it, and therefore it is spoken of
as made by them all; for in public prayers, though but one speaks, we
must all pray. Observe, (1.) Marriages ought to be blessed, and
accompanied with prayer, because every creature and every condition are
that to us, and no more, that God makes them to be. It is civil and
friendly to wish all happiness to those who enter into that condition;
and what good we desire we should pray for from the fountain of all
good. The minister who gives himself to the word and prayer, as he is
the fittest person to exhort, so he is the fittest to bless and pray for
those that enter into this relation. (2.) We ought to desire and pray
for the welfare and prosperity one of another, so far from envying or
grieving at it.

2\. Now here, (1.) They prayed for Ruth: The Lord make the woman that
has come into thy house like Rachel and Leah, that is, "God make her a
good wife and a fruitful mother." Ruth was a virtuous woman, and yet
needed the prayers of her friends, that by the grace of God she might be
made a blessing to the family she had come into. They prayed that she
might be like Rachel and Leah, rather than like Sarah and Rebekah, for
Sarah had but one son, and Rebekah but one that was in covenant, the
other was Esau, who was rejected; but Rachel and Leah did build up the
house of Israel: all their children were in the church, and their
offspring was numerous. "May she be a flourishing, fruitful, faithful
vine by thy house side." (2.) They prayed for Boaz, that he might
continue to do worthily in the city to which he was an ornament, and
might there be more and more famous. They desired that the wife might be
a blessing in the private affairs of the house, and the husband a
blessing in the public business of the town, that she in her place, and
he in his, might be wise, virtuous, and successful. Observe, The way to
be famous is to do worthily. Great reputation must be obtained by great
merits. It is not enough not to do unworthily, to be harmless and
inoffensive, but we must do worthily, be useful and serviceable to our
generation. Those that would be truly illustrious must in their places
shine as lights. (3.) They prayed for the family: "Let thy house be like
the house of Pharez," that is, "let it be very numerous, let it greatly
increase and multiply, as the house of Pharez did." The Bethlehemites
were of the house of Pharez, and knew very well how numerous it was; in
the distribution of the tribes, that grandson of Jacob had the honour
which none of the rest had but Manasseh and Ephraim, that his posterity
was subdivided into two distinct families, Hezron and Hamul, [Num
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#021.md). Now they prayed that the family
of Boaz, which was one branch of that stock, might in process of time
become as numerous and great as the whole stock now was.

[Ruth 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rut 4:13</span></span>

Here is, I. Ruth a wife. Boaz took her, with the usual solemnities, to
his house, and she became his wife ([Rut
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#013).md), all the city, no doubt,
congratulating the preferment of a virtuous woman, purely for her
virtues. We have reason to think that Orpah, who returned from Naomi to
her people and her gods, was never half so well preferred as Ruth was.
He that forsakes all for Christ shall find more than all with him; it
shall be recompensed a hundred-fold in this present time. Now Orpah
wished she had gone with Naomi too; but she, like the other kinsman,
stood in her own light. Boaz had prayed that this pious proselyte might
receive a full reward of her courage and constancy from the God of
Israel, under whose wings she had come to trust; and now he became an
instrument of that kindness, which was an answer to his prayer, and
helped to make his own words good. Now she had the command of those
servants with whom she had associated and of those fields in which she
had gleaned. Thus sometimes God raiseth up the poor out of the dust, to
set them with princes, [Psa 113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007.md),
[Psa 113:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#008.md).

II\. Ruth a mother: The Lord gave her conception; for the fruit of the
womb is his reward, [Psa 127:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#003.md). It is
one of the keys he hath in his hand; and he sometimes makes the barren
woman that had been long so to be a joyful mother of children, [Psa
113:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#009.md); [Isa
54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md).

III\. Ruth still a daughter-in-law, and the same that she always was, to
Naomi, who was so far from being forgotten that she was a principal
sharer in these new joys. The good women that were at the labour when
this child was born congratulated Naomi upon it more than either Boaz or
Ruth, because she was the match-maker, and it was the family of her
husband that was hereby built up. See here, as before, what an air of
devotion there was then even in the common expressions of civility among
the Israelites. Prayer to God attended the birth of the child. What a
pity it is that such pious language should either be disused among
Christians or degenerate into a formality. "Blessed be the Lord that has
sent thee this grandson," [Rut 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#014.md),
[Rut 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#015.md). 1. Who was the preserver of
the name of her family, and who, they hoped, would be famous, because
his father was so. 2. Who would be hereafter dutiful and kind to her, so
they hoped, because his mother was so. If he would but take after her,
he would be a comfort to his aged grandmother, a restorer of her life,
and, if there should be occasion, would have wherewithal to be the
nourisher of her old age. It is a great comfort to those that are going
into years to see any of those that descend from them growing up, that
are likely, by the blessing of God, to be a stay and support to them,
when the years come wherein they will need such, and of which they will
say they have no pleasure in them. Observe, They say of Ruth that she
loved Naomi, and therefore was better to her than seven sons. See how
God in his providence sometimes makes up the want and loss of those
relations from whom we expected most comfort in those from whom we
expected least. The bonds of love prove stronger than those of nature,
and there is a friend that sticks closer than a brother; so here there
was a daughter-in-law better than an own child. See what wisdom and
grace will do. Now here, (1.) The child is named by the neighbours, [Rut
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#017.md). The good women would have it
called Obed, a servant, either in remembrance of the meanness and
poverty of the mother or in prospect of his being hereafter a servant,
and very serviceable, to his grandmother. It is no dishonour to those
that are ever so well born to be servants to God, their friends, and
their generation. The motto of the princes of Wales is Ich dien - I
serve. (2.) The child is nursed by the grandmother, that is, dry-nursed,
when the mother had weaned him from the breast, [Rut
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#016.md). She laid it in her bosom, in
token of her tender affection to it and care of it. Grandmothers are
often the most fond.

IV\. Ruth is hereby brought in among the ancestors of David and Christ,
which was the greatest honour. The genealogy is here drawn from Pharez,
through Boaz and Obed, to David, and so leads towards the Messiah, and
therefore it is not an endless genealogy.
