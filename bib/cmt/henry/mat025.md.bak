### [Matthew Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001.md)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 25:0</span></span>

This chapter continues and concludes our Saviour's discourse, which
began in the foregoing chapter, concerning his second coming and the end
of the world. This was his farewell sermon of caution, as that, [Joh
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#015.md), [Joh
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016.md), was of comfort to his
disciples; and they had need of both in a world of so much temptation
and trouble as this is. The application of that discourse, was, Watch
therefore, and be ye also ready. Now, in prosecution of these serious
awakening cautions, in this chapter we have three parables, the scope of
which is the same - to quicken us all with the utmost care and diligence
to get ready for Christ's second coming, which, in all his farewells to
his church, mention was made of, as in that before he died ([Joh
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#002).md), in that at his ascension ([Act
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#011).md), and in that at the shutting up
of the canon of the scriptures, [Rev
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#020.md). Now it concerns us to prepare
for Christ's coming; I. That we may then be ready to attend upon him;
and this is shown in the parable of the ten virgins ([Mat
25:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001).md). II. That we may then be
ready to give u our account to him; and this is shown in the parable of
the three servants (v. 14-30). III. That we may then be ready to receive
from him our final sentence, and that it may be to eternal life; and
this is shown in a more plain description of the process of the last
judgment (v. 31-46). These are things of awful consideration, because of
everlasting concern to every one of us.

[Matthew 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 25:1</span></span>

Here,

I. That in general which is to be illustrated is, the kingdom of heaven,
the state of things under the gospel, the external kingdom of Christ,
and the administration and success of it. Some of Christ's parables had
shown us what it is like now in the present reception of it, as ch. 13.
This tells us what it shall be like, when the mystery of God shall be
finished, and that kingdom delivered up to the Father. The
administration of Christ's government, towards the ready and the unready
in the great day, may be illustrated by this similitude; or the kingdom
is put for the subjects of the kingdom. The professors of Christianity
shall then be likened to these ten virgins, and shall be thus
distinguished.

II\. That by which it is illustrated, is, a marriage solemnity. It was a
custom sometimes used among the Jews on that occasion, that the
bridegroom came, attended with his friends, late in the night, to the
house of the bride, where she expected him, attended with her
bride-maids; who, upon notice given of the bridegrooms' approach, were
to go out with lamps in their hands, to light him into the house with
ceremony and formality, in order to the celebrating of the nuptials with
great mirth. And some think that on these occasions they had usually ten
virgins; for the Jews never held a synagogue, circumcised, kept the
passover, or contracted marriage, but ten persons at least were present.
Boaz, when he married Ruth, had ten witnesses, [Rut
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#002.md). Now in this parable,

1\. The Bridegroom is our Lord Jesus Christ; he is so represented in the
45th Psalm, Solomon's Song, and often in the New Testament. It bespeaks
his singular and superlative love to, and his faithful and inviolable
covenant with, his spouse the church. Believers are now betrothed to
Christ ([Hos 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#019).md); but the
solemnizing of the marriage is reserved for the great day, when the
bride, the Lamb's wife, will have made herself completely ready, [Rev
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007.md), [Rev
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#009.md).

2\. The virgins are the professors of religion, members of the church;
but here represented as her companions ([Psa
45:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#014).md), as elsewhere her children
([Isa 54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001).md), her ornaments, [Isa
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#018.md). They that follow the Lamb, are
said to be virgins ([Rev 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004).md); this
denotes their beauty and purity; they are to be presented as chaste
virgins to Christ, [Co2 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002.md). The
bridegroom is a king; so these virgins are maids of honour, virgins
without number ([Sol 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#008).md), yet here
said to be ten.

3\. The office of these virgins is to meet the bridegroom, which is as
much their happiness as their duty. They come to wait upon the
bridegroom when he appears, and in the mean time to wait for him. See
here the nature of Christianity. As Christians, we profess ourselves to
be, (1.) Attendants upon Christ, to do him honour, as the glorious
Bridegroom, to be to him for a name and a praise, especially then when
he shall come to be glorified in his saints. We must follow him as
honorary servants do their masters, [Joh
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#026.md). Hold up the name, and hold
forth the praise of the exalted Jesus; this is our business. (2.)
Expectants of Christ, and of his second coming. As Christians, we
profess, not only to believe and look for, but to love and long for, the
appearing of Christ, and to act in our whole conversation with a regard
to it. The second coming of Christ is the centre in which all the lines
of our religion meet, and to which the whole of the divine life hath a
constant reference and tendency.

4\. Their chief concern is to have lights in their hands, when they
attend the bridegroom, thus to do him honour and do him service. Note,
Christians are children of light. The gospel is light, and they who
receive it must not only be enlightened by it themselves, but must shine
as lights, must hold it forth, [Phi
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015.md), [Phi
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016.md). This in general.

Now concerning these ten virgins, we may observe,

(1.) Their different character, with the proof and evidence of it.

\[1.\] Their character was that five were wise, and five foolish ([Mat
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#002).md); and wisdom excelleth folly, as
far as light excelleth darkness; so saith Solomon, a competent judge,
[Ecc 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#013.md). Note, Those of the same
profession and denomination among men, may yet be of characters vastly
different in the sight of God. Sincere Christians are the wise virgins,
and hypocrites the foolish ones, as in another parable they are
represented by wise and foolish builders. Note, Those are wise or
foolish indeed, that are so in the affairs of their souls. True religion
is true wisdom; sin is folly, but especially the sin of hypocrisy, for
those are the greatest fools, that are wise in their own conceit, and
those the worst of sinners, that feign themselves just men. Some observe
from the equal number of the wise and foolish, what a charitable decorum
(it is Archbishop Tillotson's expression) Christ observes, as if he
would hope that the number of true believers was nearly equal to that of
hypocrites, or, at least, would teach us to hope the best concerning
those that profess religion, and to think of them with a bias to the
charitable side. Though, in judging of ourselves, we ought to remember
that the gate is strait, and few find it; yet, in judging of others, we
ought to remember that the Captain of our salvation brings many sons to
glory.

\[2.\] The evidence of this character was in the very thing which they
were to attend to; by that they are judged of.

First, It was the folly of the foolish virgins, that they took their
lamps, and took no oil with them, [Mat
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#003.md). They had just the oil enough to
make their lamps burn for the present, to make a show with, as if they
intended to meet the bridegroom; but no cruse or bottle of oil with them
for a recruit if the bridegroom tarried; thus hypocrites,

1\. They have no principle within. They have a lamp of profession in
their hands, but have not in their hearts that stock of sound knowledge,
rooted dispositions, and settled resolutions, which is necessary to
carry them through the services and trials of the present state. They
act under the influence of external inducements, but are void of
spiritual life; like a tradesman, that sets up without a stock, or the
seed on the stony ground, that wanted root.

2\. They have no prospect of, nor make provision for, what is to come.
They took lamps for a present show, but not oil for after use. This
incogitancy is the ruin of many professors; all their care is to
recommend themselves to their neighbours, whom they now converse with,
not to approve themselves to Christ, whom they must hereafter appear
before; as if any thing will serve, provide it will but serve for the
present. Tell them of things not seen as yet, and you are like Lot to
his sons-in-law, as one that mocked. They do not provide for hereafter,
as the ant does, nor lay up for the time to come, [Ti1
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#019.md).

Secondly, It was the wisdom of the wise virgins, that they took oil in
their vessels with their lamps, [Mat
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#004.md). They had a good principle
within, which would maintain and keep up their profession. 1. The heart
is the vessel, which it is our wisdom to get furnished; for, out of a
good treasure there, good things must be brought; but if that root be
rottenness, the blossom will be dust. 2. Grace is the oil which we must
have in this vessel; in the tabernacle there was constant provision made
of oil for the light, [Exo 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#014.md). Our
light must shine before men in good works, but this cannot be, or not
long, unless there be a fixed active principle in the heart, of faith in
Christ, and love to God and our brethren, from which we must act in
every thing we do in religion, with an eye to what is before us. They
that took oil in their vessels, did it upon supposition that perhaps the
bridegroom might tarry. Note, In looking forward it is good to prepare
for the worst, to lay in for a long siege. But remember that this oil
which keeps the lamps burning, is derived to the candlestick from Jesus
Christ, the great and good Olive, by the golden pipes of the ordinances,
as it is represented in that vision ([Zac
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#002.md), [Zac
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#003.md), [Zac
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#012).md), which is explained [Joh
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016.md), Of his fulness have all we
received, and grace for grace.

(2.) Their common fault, during the bridegroom's delay; They all
slumbered and slept, [Mat 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#005.md).
Observe here,

\[1.\] The bridegroom tarried, that is, he did not come out so soon as
they expected. What we look for as certain, we are apt to think is very
near; many in the apostles' times imagined that the day of the Lord was
at hand, but it is not so. Christ, as to us, seems to tarry, and yet
really does not, [Hab 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003.md). There is
good reason for the Bridegroom's tarrying; there are many intermediate
counsels and purposes to be accomplished, the elect must all be called
in, God's patience must be manifested, and the saints' patience tried,
the harvest of the earth must be ripened, and so must the harvest of
heaven too. But though Christ tarry past our time, he will not tarry
past the due time.

\[2.\] While he tarried, those that waited for him, grew careless, and
forgot what they were attending; They all slumbered and slept; as if
they had given over looking for him; for when the Son of man cometh, he
will not find faith, [Luk 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#008.md). Those
that inferred the suddenness of it from its certainty, when that
answered not their expectation, were apt from the delay to infer its
uncertainty. The wise virgins slumbered, and the foolish slept; so some
distinguish it; however, they were both faulty. The wise virgins kept
their lamps burning, but did not keep themselves awake. Note, Too many
good Christians, when they have been long in profession, grow remiss in
their preparations for Christ's second coming; they intermit their care,
abate their zeal, their graces are not lively, nor their works found
perfect before God; and though all love be not lost, yet the first love
is left. If it was hard to the disciples to watch with Christ an hour,
much more to watch with him an age. I sleep, saith the spouse, but my
heart wakes, Observe, First, They slumbered, and then they slept. Note,
One degree of carelessness and remissness makes way for another. Those
that allow themselves in slumbering, will scarcely keep themselves from
sleeping; therefore dread the beginning of spiritual decays; Venienti
occurrite morbo - Attend to the first symptoms of disease. The ancients
generally understood the virgins' slumbering and sleeping of their
dying; they all died, wise and foolish ([Psa
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#010).md), before judgment-day. So Ferus,
Antequam veniat sponsus omnibus obdormiscendum est, hoc est, moriendum -
Before the Bridegroom come, all must sleep, that is, die. So Calvin. But
I think it is rather to be taken as we have opened it.

(3.) The surprising summons given them, to attend the bridegroom ([Mat
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#006).md); At midnight there was a cry
made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh. Note, \[1.\] Though Christ tarry
long, he will come at last; though he seem slow, he is sure. In his
first coming, he was thought long by those that waited for the
consolation of Israel; yet in the fulness of time he came; so his second
coming, though long deferred, is not forgotten; his enemies shall find,
to their cost, that forbearance is no acquittance; and his friends shall
find, to their comfort, that the vision is for an appointed time, and at
the end it shall speak, and not lie. The year of the redeemed is fixed,
and it will come. \[2.\] Christ's coming will be at our midnight, when
we least look for him, and are most disposed to take our rest. His
coming for the relief and comfort of his people, often is when the good
intended seems to be at the greatest distance; and his coming to reckon
with his enemies, is when they put the evil day furthest from them. It
was at midnight that the first-born of Egypt were destroyed, and Israel
delivered, [Exo 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#029.md). Death often
comes when it is least expected; the soul is required this night, [Luk
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#020.md). Christ will come when he
pleases, to show his sovereignty, and will not let us know when, to
teach us our duty. \[3.\] When Christ comes, we must go forth to meet
him. As Christians we are bound to attend all the motions of the Lord
Jesus, and meet him in all his out-goings. When he comes to us at death,
we must go forth out of the body, out of the world, to meet him with
affections and workings of soul suitable to the discoveries we then
expect him to make of himself. Go ye forth to meet him, is a call to
those who are habitually prepared, to be actually ready. \[4.\] The
notice given of Christ's approach, and the call to meet him, will be
awakening; There was a cry made. His first coming was not with any
observation at all, nor did they say, Lo, here is Christ, or Lo, he is
there; he was in the world, and the world knew him not; but his second
coming will be with the observation of all the world; Every eye shall
see him. There will be a cry from heaven, for he shall descend with a
shout, Arise, ye dead, and come to judgment; and a cry from the earth
too, a cry to rocks and mountains, [Rev
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#016.md).

(4.) The address they all made to answer this summons ([Mat
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#007).md); They all arose, and trimmed
their lamps, snuffed them and supplied them with oil and went about with
all expedition to put themselves in a posture to receive the bridegroom.
Now, \[1.\] This, in the wise virgins, bespeaks an actual preparation
for the Bridegroom's coming. Note, even those that are best prepared for
death, have, upon the immediate arrests of it, work to do, to get
themselves actually ready, that they may be found in peace ([Pe2
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#014).md), found doing ([Mat
24:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#046).md), and not found naked, [Co2
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#003.md). It will be a day of search and
enquiry; and it concerns us to think how we shall then be found. When we
see the day approaching, we must address ourselves to our dying work
with all seriousness, renewing our repentance for sin, our consent to
the covenant, our farewells to the world; and our souls must be carried
out toward God in suitable breathings. \[2.\] In the foolish virgins, it
denotes a vain confidence, and conceit of the goodness of their state,
and their readiness for another world. Note, Even counterfeit graces
will serve a man to make a show of when he comes to die, as well as they
have done all his life long; the hypocrite's hopes blaze when they are
just expiring, like a lightening before death.

(5.) The distress which the foolish virgins were in, for want of oil,
[Mat 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#008.md), [Mat
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#009.md). This bespeaks, \[1.\] The
apprehensions which some hypocrites have of the misery of their state,
even on this side death, when God opens their eyes to see their folly,
and themselves perishing with a lie in their right hand. Or, however,
\[2.\] The real misery of their state on the other side death, and in
the judgment; how far their fair, but false, profession of religion will
be from availing them any thing in the great day; see what comes of it.

First, Their lamps are gone out. The lamps of hypocrites often go out in
this life; when they who have begun in the spirit, end in the flesh, and
the hypocrisy breaks out in an open apostasy, [Pe2
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#020.md). The profession withers, and the
credit of it is lost; the hopes fail, and the comfort of them is gone;
how often is the candle of the wicked thus put out? [Job
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#017.md). Yet many a hypocrite keeps up
his credit, and the comfort of his profession, such as it is, to the
last; but what is it when God taketh away his soul? [Job
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#008.md). If his candle be not put out
before him, it is put out with him, [Job
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#005.md), [Job
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#006.md). He shall lie down in sorrow,
[Isa 50:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#011.md). The gains of a
hypocritical profession will not follow a man to judgment, [Mat
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#022.md), [Mat
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023.md). The lamps are gone out, when the
hypocrite's hope proves like the spider's web ([Job
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#011), etc..md), and like the giving up of
the ghost ([Job 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#020).md), like Absalom's
mule that left him in the oak.

Secondly, They wanted oil to supply them when they were going out. Note,
Those that take up short of true grace, will certainly find the want of
it one time or other. An external profession well humoured may carry a
man far, but it will not carry him through; it may light him along this
world, but the damps of the valley of the shadow of death will put it
out.

Thirdly, They would gladly be beholden to the wise virgins for a supply
out of their vessels; Give us of your oil. Note, The day is coming, when
carnal hypocrites would gladly be found in the condition of true
Christians. Those who now hate the strictness of religion, will, at
death and judgment, wish for the solid comforts of it. Those who care
not to live the life, yet would die the death, of the righteous. The day
is coming when those who now look with contempt upon humble contrite
saints, would gladly get an interest in them, and would value those as
their best friends and benefactors, whom now they set with the dogs of
their flock. Give us of your oil; that is, "Speak a good word for us;"
so some; but there is no occasion for vouchers in the great day, the
Judge knows what is every man's true character. But is it not well that
they are brought to say, Give us of your oil? It is so; but, 1. This
request was extorted by sensible necessity. Note, Those will see their
need of grace hereafter, when it should save them, who will not see
their need of grace now, when it should sanctify and rule them. (2.) It
comes too late. God would have given them oil, had they asked in time;
but there is no buying when the market is over, no bidding when the inch
of candle is dropped.

Fourthly, They were denied a share in their companions' oil. It is a sad
presage of a repulse with God, when they were thus repulsed by good
people. The wise answered, Not so; that peremptory denial is not in the
original, but supplied by the translators: these wise virgins would
rather give a reason without a positive refusal, than (as many do) give
a positive refusal without a reason. They were well inclined to help
their neighbours in distress; but, We must not, we cannot, we dare not,
do it, lest there be not enough for us and you; charity begins at home;
but go, and buy for yourselves. Note, 1. Those that would be saved, must
have grace of their own. Though we have benefit by the communion of
saints, and the faith and prayers of others may now redound to our
advantage, yet our own sanctification is indispensably necessary to our
own salvation. The just shall live by his faith. Every man shall give
account of himself, and therefore let every man prove his own work; for
he cannot get another to muster for him in that day. 2. Those that have
most grace, have none to spare; all we have, is little enough for
ourselves to appear before God in. The best have need to borrow from
Christ, but they have none to lend to any of their neighbours. The
church of Rome, which dreams of works of supererogation and the
imputation of the righteousness of saints, forgets that it was the
wisdom of the wise virgins to understand that they had but oil enough
for themselves, and none for others. But observe, These wise virgins do
not upbraid the foolish with their neglect, nor boast of their own
forecast, nor torment them with suggestions tending to despair, but give
them the best advice the case will bear, Go ye rather to them that sell.
Note, Those that deal foolishly in the affairs of their souls, are to be
pitied, and not insulted over; for who made thee to differ? When
ministers attend such as have been mindless of God and their souls all
their days, but are under death-bed convictions; and, because true
repentance is never too late, direct them to repent, and turn to God,
and close with Christ; yet, because late repentance is seldom true, they
do but as these wise virgins did by the foolish, even made the best of
bad. They can but tell them what is to be done, if it be not too late,
but whether the door may not be shut before it is done, is an
unspeakable hazard. It is good advice now, if it be taken in time, Go to
them that sell, and buy for yourselves. Note, Those that would have
grace, must have recourse to, and attend upon, the means of grace. See
[Isa 55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md)

(6.) The coming of the bridegroom, and the issue of all this different
character of the wise and foolish virgins. See what came of it.

\[1.\] While they went out to buy, the bridegroom came. Note, With
regard to those that put off their great work to the last, it is a
thousand to one, that they have not time to do it then. Getting grace is
a work of time, and cannot be done in a hurry. While the poor awakened
soul addresses itself, upon a sick bed, to repentance and prayer, in
awful confusion, it scarcely knows which end to begin at, or what to do
first; and presently death comes, judgment comes, and the work is
undone, and the poor sinner undone for ever. This comes of having oil to
buy when we should burn it, and grace to get when we should use it.

The bridegroom came. Note, Our Lord Jesus will come to his people, at
the great day, as a Bridegroom; will come in pomp and rich attire,
attended with his friends: now that the Bridegroom is taken away from
us, we fast ([Mat 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#015).md), but then will
be an everlasting feast. Then the Bridegroom will fetch home his bride,
to be where he is ([Joh 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024).md), and
will rejoice over his bride, [Isa
62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005.md).

\[2.\] They that were ready, went in with him to the marriage. Note,
First, To be eternally glorified is to go in with Christ to the
marriage, to be in his immediate presence, and in the most intimate
fellowship and communion with him in a state of eternal rest, joy, and
plenty. Secondly, Those, and those only, shall go to heaven hereafter,
that are made ready for heaven here, that are wrought to the self-same
thing, [Co2 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#005.md). Thirdly, The
suddenness of death, and of Christ's coming to us then, will be no
obstruction to our happiness, if we have been habitually prepared.

\[3.\] The door was shut, as is usual when all the company is come, that
are to be admitted. The door was shut, First, To secure those that were
within; that, being now made pillars in the house of our God, they may
go no more out, [Rev 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012.md). Adam was
put into paradise, but the door was left open and so he went out again;
but when glorified saints are put into the heavenly paradise, they are
shut in. Secondly, To exclude those that were out. The state of saints
and sinners will then be unalterably fixed, and those that are shut out
then, will be shut out for ever. Now the gate is strait, yet it is open;
but then it will be shut and bolted, and a great gulf fixed. This was
like the shutting of the door of the ark when Noah was in; as he was
thereby preserved, so all the rest were finally abandoned.

\[4.\] The foolish virgins came when it was too late ([Mat
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#011).md); Afterward came also the other
virgins. Note, First, There are many that will seek admission into
heaven when it is too late; as profane Esau, who afterward would have
inherited the blessing. God and religion will be glorified by those late
solicitations, though sinners will not be saved by them; it is for the
honour of Lord, Lord, that, of fervent and importunate prayer, that
those who slight it now, will flee to it shortly, and it will not be
called whining and canting then. Secondly, The vain confidence of
hypocrites will carry them very far in their expectations of happiness.
They go to heaven-gate, and demand entrance, and yet are shut out;
lifted up to heaven in a fond conceit of the goodness of their state,
and yet thrust down to hell.

\[5.\] They were rejected, as Esau was ([Mat
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#012).md); I know you not. Note, We are
all concerned to seek the Lord while he may be found; for there is a
time coming when he will not be found. Time was, when, Lord, Lord, open
to us, would have sped well, by virtue of that promise, Knock, and it
shall be opened to you; but now it comes too late. The sentence is
solemnly bound on with, Verily I say unto you, which amounts to no less
than swearing in his wrath, that they shall never enter into his rest.
It bespeaks him resolved, and them silenced by it.

Lastly, Here is a practical inference drawn from this parable ([Mat
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#013).md); Watch therefore, We had it
before ([Mat 24:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#042).md), and here it is
repeated as the most needful caution. Note, 1. Our great duty is to
watch, to attend to the business of our souls with the utmost diligence
and circumspection. Be awake, and be wakeful. 2. It is a good reason for
our watching, that the time of our Lord's coming is very uncertain; we
know neither the day nor the hour. Therefore every day and every hour we
must be ready, and not off our watch any day in the year, or any hour in
the day. Be thou in the fear of the Lord every day and all the day long.

[Matthew 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 25:14</span></span>

We have here the parable of the talents committed to three servants;
this implies that we are in a state of work and business, as the former
implies that we are in a state of expectancy. That showed the necessity
of habitual preparation, this of actual diligence in our present work
and service. In that we were stirred up to do well for our own souls; in
this to lay out ourselves for the glory of God and the good of others.

In this parable, 1. The Master is Christ, who is the absolute Owner and
Proprietor of all persons and things, and in a special manner of his
church; into his hands all things are delivered. 2. The servants are
Christians, his own servants, so they are called; born in his house,
bought with his money, devoted to his praise, and employed in his work.
It is probable that ministers are specially intended here, who are more
immediately attending on him, and sent by him. St. Paul often calls
himself a servant of Jesus Christ. See [Ti2
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#024.md).

We have three things, in general, in this parable.

I. The trust committed to these servants; Their master delivered to them
his goods: having appointed them to work (for Christ keeps no servants
to be idle), he left them something to work upon. Note, 1. Christ's
servants have and receive their all from him; for they are of themselves
worth nothing, nor have any thing they can call their own but sin. 2.
Our receiving from Christ is in order to our working for him. Our
privileges are intended to find us with business. The manifestation of
the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. 3. Whatever we
receive to be made use of for Christ, still the property is vested in
him; we are but tenants upon his land, stewards of his manifold grace,
[Pe1 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#010.md). Now observe here,

(1.) On what occasion this trust was committed to these servants: The
master was travelling into a far country. This is explained, [Eph
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008.md). When he ascended on high, he gave
gifts to men. Note, \[1.\] When Christ went to heaven, he was as a man
travelling into a far country; that is, he went with a purpose to be
away a great while. \[2.\] When he went, he took care to furnish his
church with all things necessary for it during his personal absence.
For, and in consideration of, his departure, he committed to his church
truths, laws, promises and powers; these were the parakatathēkē - the
great depositum (as it is called, [Ti1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020.md); [Ti2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#014).md), the good thing that is
committed to us; and he sent his Spirit to enable his servants to teach
and profess those truths, to press and observe those laws, to improve
and apply those promises, and to exercise and employ those powers,
ordinary or extraordinary. Thus Christ, at his ascension, left his goods
to his church.

(2.) In what proportion this trust was committed. \[1.\] He gave
talents; a talent of silver is computed to be in our money three hundred
and fifty-three pounds eleven shillings and ten pence halfpenny; so the
learned Bishop Cumberland. Note, Christ's gifts are rich and valuable,
the purchases of his blood inestimable, and none of them mean. \[2.\] He
gave to some more, to others less; to one five talents, to another two,
to another one; to every one according to his several ability. When
Divine Providence has made a difference in men's ability, as to mind,
body, estate, relation, and interest, divine grace dispenses spiritual
gifts accordingly, but still the ability itself is from him. Observe,
First, Every one had some one talent at least, and that is not a
despicable stock for a poor servant to begin with. A soul of our own is
the one talent we are every one of us entrusted with, and it will find
us with work. Hoc nempe ab homine exigiture, ut prosit hominibus; si
fieri potest, multis; si minus, paucis; si minus, proximis, si minus,
sibi: nam cum se utilem caeteris efficit, commune agit negotium. Et si
quis bene de se meretur, hoc ipso aliis prodest quod aliis profuturum
parat - It is the duty of a man to render himself beneficial to those
around him; to a great number if possible; but if this is denied him, to
a few; to his intimate connections; or, at least, to himself. He that is
useful to others, may be reckoned a common good. And whoever entitles
himself to his own approbation, is serviceable to others, as forming
himself to those habits which will result in their favour. Seneca de
Otio Sapient. Secondly, All had not alike, for they had not all alike
abilities and opportunities. God is a free Agent, dividing to every man
severally as he will; some are cut out for service in one kind, others
in another, as the members of the natural body. When the householder had
thus settled his affairs, he straightway took his journey. Our Lord
Jesus, when he had given commandments to his apostles, as one in haste
to be gone, went to heaven.

II\. The different management and improvement of this trust, which we
have an account of, [Mat 25:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#016.md).

1\. Two of the servants did well.

(1.) They were diligent and faithful; They went, and traded; they put
the money they were entrusted with, to the use for which it was intended
- laid it out in goods, and made returns of it; as soon as ever their
master was gone, they immediately applied themselves to their business.
Those that have so much work to do, as every Christian has, need to set
about it quickly, and lose not time. They went, and traded. Note, A true
Christian is a spiritual tradesman. Trades are called mysteries, and
without controversy great is the mystery of godliness; it is a
manufacture trade; there is something to be done by upon our own hearts,
and for the good of others. It is a merchant-trade; things of less value
to us are parted with for things of greater value; wisdom's merchandize,
[Pro 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#015.md); [Mat
13:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#045.md). A tradesman is one who, having
made his trade his choice, and taken pains to learn it, makes it his
business to follow it, lays out all he has for the advancement of it,
makes all other affairs bend to it, and lives upon the gain of it. Thus
does a true Christian act in the work of religion; we have no stock of
our own to trade with, but trade as factors with our master's stock. The
endowments of the mind - reason, wit, learning, must be used in
subserviency to religion; the enjoyments of the world - estate, credit,
interest, power, preferment, must be improved for the honour of Christ.
The ordinances of the gospel, and our opportunities of attending them,
bibles, ministers, sabbaths, sacraments, must be improved for the end
for which they were instituted, and communion with God kept up by them,
and the gifts and graces of the Spirit must be exercised; and this is
trading with our talents.

(2.) They were successful; they doubled their stock, and in a little
time made cent. per cent. of it: he that had five talents, soon made
them other five. Trading with our talents is not alway successful with
others, but, however, it shall be so to ourselves, [Isa
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004.md). Note, The hand of the diligent
makes rich in graces, and comforts, and treasures of good works. There
is a great deal to be got by industry in religion.

Observe, The returns were in proportion to the receivings. \[1.\] From
those to whom God hath given five talents, he expects the improvement of
five, and to reap plentifully where he sows plentifully. The greater
gifts any have, the more pains they ought to take, as those must that
have a large stock to manage. \[2.\] From those to whom he has given but
two talents, he expects only the improvement of two, which may encourage
those who are placed in a lower and narrower sphere of usefulness; if
they lay out themselves to do good according to the best of their
capacity and opportunity, they shall be accepted, though they do not so
much good as others.

2\. The third did ill ([Mat 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#018).md); He
that had received one talent, went, and hid his lord's money. Though the
parable represents but one in three unfaithful, yet in a history that
answers this parable, we find the disproportion quite the other way,
when ten lepers were cleansed, nine of ten hid the talent, and only one
returned to give thanks, [Luk 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#017.md),
[Luk 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#018.md). The unfaithful servant was
he that had but one talent: doubtless there are many that have five
talents, and bury them all; great abilities, great advantages, and yet
do no good with them: but Christ would hint to us, (1.) That if he that
had but one talent, be reckoned with thus for burying that one, much
more will they be accounted offenders, that have more, that have many,
and bury them. If he that was but of small capacity, was cast into utter
darkness because he did not improve what he had as he might have done,
of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy,
that tramples underfoot the greatest advantages? (2.) That those who
have least to do for God, frequently do least of what they have to do.
Some make it an excuse for their laziness, that they have not the
opportunities of serving God that others have; and because they have not
wherewithal to do what they say they would, they will not do what we are
sure they can, and so sit down and do nothing; it is really an
aggravation of their sloth, that when they have but one talent to take
care about, they neglect that one.

He digged in the earth, and hid the talent, for fear it should be
stolen; he did not misspend or misemploy it, did not embezzle it or
squander it away, but he hid it. Money is like manure (so my Lord Bacon
used to say,) good for nothing in the heap, but it must be spread; yet
it is an evil which we have often seen under the sun, treasure heaped
together ([Jam 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#003.md); [Ecc
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#001.md), [Ecc
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#002).md), which does good to nobody; and
so it is in spiritual gifts; many have them, and make no use of them for
the end for which they were given them. Those that have estates, and do
not lay them out in works of piety and charity; that have power and
interest, and do not with it promote religion in the places where they
live; ministers that have capacities and opportunities of doing good,
but do not stir up the gift that is in them, are those slothful servants
that seek their own things more than Christ's.

He hid his lord's money; had it been his own, he might have done as he
pleased; but, whatever abilities and advantages we have, they are not
our own, we are but stewards of them, and must give account to our Lord,
whose goods they are. It was an aggravation of his slothfulness, that
his fellow-servants were busy and successful in trading, and their zeal
should have provoked his. Are others active, and shall we be idle?

III\. The account of this improvement, [Mat
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#019.md). 1. The account is deferred; it
is not till after a long time that they are reckoned with; not that the
master neglects his affairs, or that God is slack concerning his promise
([Pe2 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#009).md); no, he is ready to judge
([Pe1 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#005).md); but every thing must be
done in its time and order. 2. Yet the day of account comes at last; The
lord of those servants reckoneth with them. Note, The stewards of the
manifold grace of God must shortly give account of their stewardship. We
must all be reckoned with - what good we have got to our own souls, and
what good we have done to others by the advantages we have enjoyed. See
[Rom 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#010.md), [Rom
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#011.md). Now here is,

(1.) The good account of the faithful servants; and here observe,

\[1.\] The servants giving up the account ([Mat
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#020.md), [Mat
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#022).md); "Lord, thou deliveredst to me
five talents, and to me two; behold, I have gained five talents, and I
two talents more."

First, Christ's faithful servants acknowledge with thankfulness his
vouchsafements to them; Lord, thou deliveredst to me such and such
things. Note, 1. It is good to keep a particular account of our
receivings from God, to remember what we have received, that we may know
what is expected from us, and may render according to the benefit. 2. We
must never look upon our improvements but with a general mention of
God's favour to us, of the honour he has put upon us, in entrusting us
with his goods, and of that grace which is the spring and fountain of
all the good that is in us or is done by us. For the truth is, the more
we do for God, the more we are indebted to him for making use of us, and
enabling us, for his service.

Secondly, They produce, as an evidence of their faithfulness, what they
have gained. Note, God's good stewards have something to show for their
diligence; Show me thy faith by thy works. He that is a good man, let
him show it, [Jam 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#013.md). If we be
careful in our spiritual trade, it will soon be seen by us, and our
works will follow us, [Rev 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013.md). Not
that the saints will in the great day make mention of their own good
deeds; no, Christ will do that for them ([Mat
25:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#035).md); but it intimates that they who
faithfully improve their talents, shall have boldness in the day of
Christ, 1 Jn. 2:28-4:17. And it is observable that he who had but two
talents, gave up his account as cheerfully as he who had five; for our
comfort, in the day of account, will be according to our faithfulness,
not according to our usefulness; our sincerity, not our success;
according to the uprightness of our hearts, not according to the degree
of our opportunities.

\[2.\] The master's acceptance and approbation of their account, [Mat
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#021.md), [Mat
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#023.md).

First, He commended them; Well done, good and faithful servant. Note,
The diligence and integrity of those who approve themselves the good and
faithful servants of Jesus Christ, will certainly be found to praise,
and honour, and glory, at his appearing, [Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md). Those that own and honour God
now, he will own and honour shortly. 1. Their persons will be accepted;
Thou good and faithful servant. He that knows the integrity of his
servants now, will witness to it in the great day; and they that are
found faithful, shall be called so. Perhaps they were censured by men,
as righteous overmuch; but Christ will give them their just characters,
of good and faithful. 2. Their performances will be accepted; Well done.
Christ will call those, and those only, good servants, that have done
well; for it is by patient continuance in well-doing that we seek for
this glory and honour; and if we seek, we shall find; if we do that
which is good, and do it well, we shall have praise of the same. Some
masters are so morose, that they will not commend their servants, though
they do their work ever so well; it is thought enough not to chide: but
Christ will commend his servants that do well; whether their praise be
of men or not, it is of him; and if we have the good word of our Master,
the matter is not great what our fellow-servants say of us; if he saith,
Well done, we are happy, and it should then be a small thing to us to be
judged of men's judgment; as, on the contrary, not he who commendeth
himself, or whom his neighbours commend, is approved, but whom the Lord
commends.

Secondly, He rewards them. The faithful servants of Christ shall not be
put off with bare commendation; no, all their work and labour of love
shall be rewarded.

Now this reward is here expressed two ways.

1\. In one expression agreeable to the parable; Thou hast been faithful
over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things. It is usual
in the courts of princes, and families of great men, to advance those to
higher offices, that have been faithful in lower. Note, Christ is a
master that will prefer his servants who acquit themselves well. Christ
has honour in store for those that honour him - a crown ([Ti2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008).md), a throne ([Rev
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021).md), a kingdom, [Mat
25:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034.md). Here they are beggars; in
heaven they shall be rulers. The upright shall have dominion: Christ's
servants are all princes.

Observe the disproportion between the work and the reward; there are but
few things in which the saints are serviceable to the glory of God, but
there are many things wherein they shall be glorified with God. What
charge we receive from God, what work we do for God in this world, is
but little, very little, compared with the joy set before us. Put
together all our service, all our sufferings, all our improvements, all
the good we do to others, all we get to ourselves, and they are but a
few things, next to nothing, not worthy to be compared, not fit to be
named the same day with the glory to be revealed.

2\. In another expression, which slips out of the parable into the thing
signified by it; Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord. Note, (1.) The
state of the blessed is a state of joy, not only because all tears shall
then be wiped away, but all the springs of comfort shall be opened to
them, and the fountains of joy broken up. Where there are the vision and
fruition of God, a perfection of holiness, and the society of the
blessed, there cannot but be a fulness of joy. (2.) This joy is the joy
of their Lord; the joy which he himself has purchased and provided for
them; the joy of the redeemed, bought with the sorrow of the Redeemer.
It is the joy which he himself is in the possession of, and which he had
his eye upon when he endured the cross, and despised the shame, [Heb
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002.md). It is the joy of which he
himself is the fountain and centre. It is the joy of our Lord, for it is
joy in the Lord, who is our exceeding joy. Abraham was not willing that
the steward of his house, though faithful, should be his heir ([Gen
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#003).md); but Christ admits his faithful
stewards into his own joy, to be joint-heirs with him. (3.) Glorified
saints shall enter into this joy, shall have a full and complete
possession of it, as the heir when he comes of age enters upon his
estate, or as they that were ready, went in to the marriage feast. Here
the joy of our Lord enters into the saints, in the earnest of the
Spirit; shortly they shall enter into it, shall be in it to eternity, as
in their element.

(2.) The bad account of the slothful servant. Observe,

\[1.\] His apology for himself, [Mat
25:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#024.md), [Mat
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#025.md). Though he had received but one
talent, for that one he is called to account. The smallness of our
receiving will not excuse us from a reckoning. None shall be called to
an account for more than they have received; but for what we have, we
must all account.

Observe, First, What he confides in. He comes to the account with a deal
of assurance, relying on the plea he had to put in, that he was able to
say, "Lo, there thou hast that is thine; if I have not made it more, as
the others have done, yet this I can say, I have not made it less."
This, he thinks, may serve to bring him off, if not with praise, yet
with safety.

Note, Many a one goes very securely to judgment, presuming upon the
validity of a plea that will be overruled as vain and frivolous.
Slothful professors, that are afraid of doing too much for God, yet hope
to come off as well as those that take so much pains in religion. Thus
the sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render
a reason, [Pro 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#016.md). This servant
thought that his account would pass well enough, because he could say,
There thou hast that is thine. "Lord, I was no spendthrift of my estate,
no prodigal of my time, no profaner of my sabbaths, no opposer of good
ministers and good preaching; Lord, I never ridiculed my bible, nor set
my wits to work to banter religion, nor abused my power to persecute any
good man; I never drowned my parts, nor wasted God's good creatures in
drunkenness and gluttony, nor ever to my knowledge did I injury to any
body." Many that are called Christians, build great hopes for heaven
upon their being able to make such an account; yet all this amounts to
no more than there thou hast that is thine; as if no more were required,
or could be expected.

Secondly, What he confesses. He owns the burying of his talent; I hid
thy talent in the earth. He speaks as if that were no great fault; nay,
as if he deserved praise for his prudence in putting it in a safe place,
and running no hazards with it. Note, It is common for people to make a
very light matter of that which will be their condemnation in the great
day. Or, if he was conscious to himself that it was his fault, it
intimates how easily slothful servants will be convicted in the
judgment; there will need no great search for proof, for their own
tongues shall fall upon them.

Thirdly, What he makes his excuse; I knew that thou were a hard man, and
I was afraid. Good thought of God would beget love, and that love would
make us diligent and faithful; but hard thoughts of God beget fear, and
that fear makes us slothful and unfaithful. His excuse bespeaks,

1\. The sentiments of an enemy; I knew thee, that thou art a hard man.
This was like that wicked saying of the house of Israel, The way of the
Lord is not equal, [Eze 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#025.md). Thus
his defence is his offence. The foolishness of man perverteth his way,
and then, as if that would mend the matter, his heart fretteth against
the Lord. This is covering the transgression, as Adam, who implicitly
laid the fault on God himself; The woman which thou gavest me. Note,
Carnal hearts are apt to conceive false and wicked opinions concerning
God, and with them to harden themselves in their evil ways. Observe how
confidently he speaks; I knew thee to be so. How could he know him to be
so? What iniquity have we or our fathers found in him? [Jer
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#005.md). Wherein has he wearied us with
his work, or deceived us in his wages? [Mic
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#003.md). Has he been a wilderness to us,
or a land of darkness? Thus long God has governed the world, and may ask
with more reason than Samuel himself could, Whom have I defrauded? or
whom have I oppressed? Does not all the world know the contrary, that he
is so far from being a hard master, that the earth is full of his
goodness, so far from reaping where he sowed not, that he sows a great
deal where he reaps nothing? For he causes the sun to shine, and his
rain to fall, upon the evil and unthankful, and fills their hearts with
food and gladness who say to the Almighty, Depart from us. This
suggestion bespeaks the common reproach which wicked people cast upon
God, as if all the blame of their sin and ruin lay at his door, for
denying them his grace; whereas it is certain that never any who
faithfully improved the common grace they had, perished for want of
special grace; nor can any show what could in reason have been done more
for an unfruitful vineyard than God has done in it. God does not demand
brick, and deny straw; no, whatever is required in the covenant, is
promised in the covenant; so that if we perish, it is owing to
ourselves.

2\. The spirit of a slave; I was afraid, This ill affection toward God
arose from his false notions of him; and nothing is more unworthy of
God, nor more hinders our duty to him, than slavish fear. This has
bondage and torment, and is directly opposite to that entire love which
the great commandment requires. Note, Hard thoughts of God drive us
fRom. and cramp us in his service. Those who think it impossible to
please him, and in vain to serve him, will do nothing to purpose in
religion.

\[2.\] His Lord's answer to this apology. His plea will stand him in no
stead, it is overruled, nay, it is made to turn against him, and he is
struck speechless with it; for here we have his conviction and his
condemnation.

First, His conviction, [Mat 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#026.md),
[Mat 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#027.md). Two things he is convicted
of.

1\. Slothfulness; Thou wicked and slothful servant. Note, Slothful
servants are wicked servants, and will be reckoned with as such by their
master, for he that is slothful in his work, and neglects the good that
God has commanded, is brother to him that is a great waster, by doing
the evil that God has forbidden, [Pro
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#009.md). He that is careless in God's
work, is near akin to him that is busy in the devil's work. Satis est
mali nihil fecisse boni - To do no good is to incur very serious blame.
Omissions are sins, and must come into judgment; slothfulness makes way
for wickedness; all become filthy, for there is none that doeth good,
[Psa 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#003.md). When the house is empty,
the unclean spirit takes possession. Those that are idle in the affairs
of their souls, are not only idle, but something worse, [Ti1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#013.md). When men sleep, the enemy sows
tares.

2\. Self-contradiction ([Mat 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#026.md),
[Mat 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#027).md); Thou knewest that I reap
where I sowed not: thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the
exchangers. Note, The hard thoughts which sinners have of God, though
false and unjust, will be so far from justifying their wickedness and
slothfulness, that they will rather aggravate and add to their guilt.
Three ways this may be taken; (1.) "Suppose I had been so hard a master,
shouldest not thou therefore have been the more diligent and careful to
please me, if not for love, yet for fear, and for that reason oughtest
not thou to have minded thy work?" If our God is a consuming fire, in
consideration of that let us study how to serve him. Or thus, (2.) "If
thou didst think me to be a hard master, and therefore durst not trade
with the money thyself, for fear of losing by it, and being made to
stand to the loss, yet thou mightest have put it into the hands of the
exchangers, or goldsmith, mightest have brought it into the bank, and
then at my coming, if I could not have had the greater improvement, by
trade and merchandize (as of the other talents), yet I might have had
the less improvement, of bare interest, and should have received my own
with usury;" which, it seems, was a common practice at that time, and
not disallowed by our Saviour. Note, If we could not, or durst not, do
what we would, yet that excuse will not serve, when it will be made to
appear that we did not do what we could and durst. If we could not find
in our hearts to venture upon more difficult and hazardous services, yet
will that justify us in shrinking from those that were more safe and
easy? Something is better than nothing; if we fail of showing our
courage in bold enterprises, yet we must not fail to testify our
goodwill in honest endeavours; and our Master will not despise the day
of small things. Or thus, (3.) "Suppose I did reap where I sowed not,
yet that is nothing to thee, for I had sowed upon thee, and the talent
was my money which thou wast entrusted with, not only to keep, but to
improve." Note, In the day of account, wicked and slothful servants will
be left quite without excuse; frivolous pleas will be overruled, and
every mouth will be stopped; and those who now stand so much upon their
own justification will not have one word to say for themselves.

Secondly, His condemnation. The slothful servant is sentenced,

1\. To be deprived of his talent ([Mat
25:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#028.md), [Mat
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#029).md); Take therefore the talent from
him. The talents were first disposed of by the Master, as an absolute
Owner, but this was now disposed of by him as a Judge; he takes it from
the unfaithful servant, to punish him, and gives it to him that was
eminently faithful, to reward him. And the meaning of this part of the
parable we have in the reason of the sentence ([Mat
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#029).md), To every one that hath shall
be given. This may be applied, (1.) To the blessings of this life -
worldly wealth and possessions. These we are entrusted with, to be used
for the glory of God, and the good of those about us. Now he that hath
these things, and useth them for these ends, he shall have abundance;
perhaps abundance of the things themselves, at least, abundance of
comfort in them, and of better things; but from him that hath not, that
is, that hath these things as if he had them not, had not power to eat
of them, or to do good with (Avaro deest, tam quod habet, quam quod non
habet - The miser may be considered as destitute of what he has, as well
as of what he has not), they shall be taken away. Solomon explains this,
[Pro 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#024.md). There is that scattereth,
and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, and
it tendeth to poverty. Giving to the poor is trading with what we have,
and the returns will be rich; it will multiply the meal in the barrel,
and the oil in the cruse: but those that are sordid, and niggardly, and
uncharitable, will find that those riches which are so got, perish by
evil travail, [Ecc 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#013.md), [Ecc
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#014.md). Sometimes Providence strangely
transfers estates from those that do no good with them to those that do;
they are gathered for him that will pity the poor, [Pro
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#008.md). See [Pro
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#022.md); [Job
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#016.md), [Job
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#017.md); [Ecc
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#026). (2..md) We may apply it to the
means of grace. They who are diligent in improving the opportunities
they have, God will enlarge them, will set before them an open door
([Rev 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#008).md); but they who know not the
day of their visitation, shall have the things that belong to their
peace hid from their eyes. For proof of this, go see what God did to
Shiloh, [Jer 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#012). (3..md) We may apply
it to the common gifts of the Spirit. He that hath these, and doeth good
with them, shall have abundance; these gifts improve by exercise, and
brighten by being used; the more we do, the more we may do, in religion;
but those who stir not up the gift that is in them, who do not exert
themselves according to their capacity, their gifts rust, and decay, and
go out like a neglected fire. From his that hath not a living principle
of grace in his soul, shall be taken away the common gifts which he
hath, as the lamps of the foolish virgins went out for want of oil, [Jer
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#008.md). Thus the arm of the idle
shepherd, which he had sluggishly folded up in his bosom, comes to be
dried up, and his right eye, which he had carelessly or wilfully shut,
becomes utterly darkened, as it is threatened, [Zac
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#017.md).

2\. He is sentenced to be cast into outer darkness, [Mat
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#030.md). Here,

(1.) His character is that of an unprofitable servant. Note, Slothful
servants will be reckoned with as unprofitable servants, who do nothing
to the purpose of their coming into the world, nothing to answer the end
of their birth or baptism, who are no way serviceable to the glory of
God, the good of others, or the salvation of their own souls. A slothful
servant is a withered member in the body, a barren tree in the vineyard,
an idle drone in the hive, he is good for nothing. In one sense, we are
all unprofitable servants ([Luk
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010).md); we cannot profit God, [Job
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#002.md). But to others, and to ourselves,
it is required that we be profitable; if we be not, Christ will not own
us as his servants: it is not enough not to do hurt, but we must do
good, must bring forth fruit, and though thereby God is not profited,
yet he is glorified, [Joh 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#008.md).

(2.) His doom is, to be cast into outer darkness. Here, as in what was
said to the faithful servants, our Saviour slides insensibly out of the
parable into the thing intended by it, and it serves as a key to the
whole; for, outer darkness, where there is weeping and gnashing of
teeth, is, in Christ's discourses, the common periphrasis of the
miseries of the damned in hell. Their state is, \[1.\] Very dismal; it
is outer darkness. Darkness is uncomfortable and frightful: it was one
of the plagues of Egypt. In hell there are chains of darkness, [Pe2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004.md). In the dark no man can work, a
fit punishment for a slothful servant. It is outer darkness, out from
the light of heaven, out from the joy of their Lord, into which the
faithful servants were admitted; out from the feast. Compare [Mat
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#012.md); [Mat
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#013.md). \[2.\] Very doleful; there is
weeping, which bespeaks great sorrow, and gnashing of teeth, which
bespeaks great vexation and indignation. This will be the portion of the
slothful servant.

[Matthew 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 25:31</span></span>

We have here a description of the process of the last judgment in the
great day. There are some passages in it that are parabolical; as the
separating between the sheep and the goats, and the dialogues between
the judge and the persons judged: but there is no thread of similitude
carried through the discourse, and therefore it is rather to be called a
draught or delineation of the final judgment, than a parable; it is, as
it were, the explanation of the former parables. And here we have,

I. The placing of the judge upon the judgment-seat ([Mat
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031).md); When the Son of man shall
come. Observe here,

1\. That there is a judgment to come, in which every man shall be
sentenced to a state of everlasting happiness, or misery, in the world
of recompence or retribution, according to what he did in this world of
trial and probation, which is to be judged of by the rule of the
everlasting gospel.

2\. The administration of the judgment of the great day is committed to
the Son of man; for by him God will judge the world ([Act
17:31](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#031).md), and to him all judgment is
committed, and therefore the judgment of that day, which is the centre
of all. Here, as elsewhere, when the last judgment is spoken of, Christ
is called the son of man, because he is to judge the sons of men (and,
being himself of the same nature, he is the more unexceptionable); and
because his wonderful condescension to take upon him our nature, and to
become the son of man, will be recompensed by this exaltation in that
day, and an honour put upon the human nature.

3\. Christ's appearing to judge the world will be splendid and glorious.
Agrippa and Bernice came to the judgment-seat with great pomp ([Act
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#023).md); but that was (as the original
word is) great fancy. Christ will come to the judgment-seat in real
glory: the Sun of righteousness shall then shine in his meridian lustre,
and the Prince of the kings of the earth shall show the riches of his
glorious kingdom, and the honours of his excellent majesty; and all the
world shall see what the saints only do now believe - that he is the
brightness of his Father's glory. He shall come not only in the glory of
his Father, but in his own glory, as mediator: his first coming was
under a black cloud of obscurity; his second will be in a bright cloud
of glory. The assurance Christ gave his disciples of his future glory,
might help to take off the offence of the cross, and his approaching
disgrace and suffering.

4\. When Christ comes in his glory to judge the world, he will bring all
his holy angels with him. This glorious person will have a glorious
retinue, his holy myriads, who will be not only his attendants, but
ministers of his justice; they shall come with him both for state and
service. They must come to call the court ([Th1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016).md), to gather the elect ([Mat
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031).md), to bundle the tares ([Mat
13:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#040).md), to be witnesses of the saints'
glory ([Luk 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#008).md), and of sinners'
misery, [Rev 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#010.md).

5\. He will then sit upon the throne of his glory. He is now set down
with the Father upon his throne; and it is a throne of grace, to which
we may come boldly; it is a throne of government, the throne of his
father David; he is a priest upon that throne: but then he will sit upon
the throne of glory, the throne of judgment. See [Dan
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md), [Dan
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010.md). Solomon's throne, though there
was not its like in any kingdom, was but a dunghill to it. Christ, in
the days of his flesh, was arraigned as a prisoner at the bar; but at
his second coming, he will sit as a judge upon the bench.

II\. The appearing of all the children of men before him ([Mat
25:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#032).md); Before him shall be gathered
all nations. Note, The judgment of the great day will be a general
judgment. All must be summoned before Christ's tribunal; all of every
age of the world, from the beginning to the end of time; all of every
place on earth, even from the remotest corners of the world, most
obscure, and distant from each other; all nations, all those nations of
men that are made of one blood, to dwell on all the face of the earth.

III\. The distinction that will then be made between the precious and
the vile; He shall separate them one from another, as the tares and
wheat are separated at the harvest, the good fish and the bad at the
shore, the corn and chaff in the floor. Wicked and godly here dwell
together in the same kingdoms, cities, churches, families, and are not
certainly distinguishable one from another; such are the infirmities of
saints, such the hypocrisies of sinners, and one event to both: but in
that day they will be separated, and parted for ever; Then shall ye
return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, [Mal
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#018.md). They cannot separate themselves
one from another in this world ([Co1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#010).md), nor can any one else separate
them ([Mat 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#029).md); but the Lord knows
them that are his, and he can separate them. This separation will be so
exact, that the most inconsiderable saints shall not be lost in the
crowd of sinners, nor the most plausible sinner hid in the crowd of
saints ([Psa 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#005).md), but every one shall
go to his own place. This is compared to a shepherd's dividing between
the sheep and the goats; it is taken from [Eze
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#017.md), Behold, I judge between cattle
and cattle. Note, 1. Jesus Christ is the great Shepherd; he now feeds
his flock like a shepherd, and will shortly distinguish between those
that are his, and those that are not, as Laban divided his sheep from
Jacob's, and set three days' journey between them, [Gen
30:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#035.md), [Gen
30:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#036.md). 2. The godly are like sheep -
innocent, mild, patient, useful: the wicked are like goats, a baser kind
of animal, unsavoury and unruly. The sheep and goats are here feeding
all day in the same pasture, but will be coted at night in different
folds. Being thus divided, he will set the sheep on his right hand, and
the goats on his left, [Mat 25:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#033.md).
Christ puts honour upon the godly, as we show respect to those we set on
our right hand; but the wicked shall rise to everlasting shame, [Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md). It is not said that he shall put
the rich on his right hand, and the poor on his left; the learned and
noble on his right hand, and unlearned and despised on his left; but the
godly on his right hand, and the wicked on his left. All other divisions
and subdivisions will then be abolished; but the great distinction of
men into saints and sinners, sanctified and unsanctified, will remain
for ever, and men's eternal state will be determined by it. The wicked
took up with left-handed blessings, riches and honour, and so shall
their doom be.

IV\. The process of the judgement concerning each of these.

1\. Concerning the godly, on the right hand. Their cause must be first
despatched, that they may be assessors with Christ in the judgement of
the wicked, whose misery will be aggravated by their seeing Abraham, and
Isaac, and Jacob, admitted into the kingdom of heaven, [Luk
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#028.md). Observe here,

(1.) The glory conferred upon them; the sentence by which they shall be
not only acquitted, but preferred and rewarded ([Mat
25:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034).md); The king shall say unto them.
He that was the Shepherd (which bespeaks the care and tenderness
wherewith he will make this disquisition), is here the King, which
bespeaks the authority wherewith he will then pronounce the sentence:
where the word of this King is, there is power. Here are two things in
this sentence:

\[1.\] The acknowledging of the saints to be the blessed of the Lord;
Come, ye blessed of my Father. First, He pronounces them blessed; and
his saying they are blessed, makes them so. The law curses them for
their many discontinuances; but Christ having redeemed them from the
curse of the law, and purchased a blessing for them, commands a blessing
on them. Secondly, Blessed of his Father; reproached and cursed by the
world, but blessed of God. As the Spirit glorifies the Son ([Joh
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#014).md), so the Son glorifies the
Father by referring the salvation of the saints to him as the First
Cause; all our blessings in heavenly things flow to us from God, as the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, [Eph
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003.md). Thirdly, He calls them to come:
this come is, in effect, "Welcome, ten thousand welcomes, to the
blessings of my father; come to me, come to be for ever with me; you
that followed me bearing the cross, now come along with me wearing the
crown. The blessed of my Father are the beloved of my soul, that have
been too long at a distance from me; come, now, come into my bosom, come
into my arms, come into my dearest embraces!" O with what joy will this
fill the hearts of the saints in that day! We now come boldly to the
throne of grace, but we shall then come boldly to the throne of glory;
and this word holds out the golden sceptre, with an assurance that our
requests shall be granted to more than the half of the kingdom. Now the
Spirit saith, Come, in the word; and the bride saith, Come, in prayer;
and the result hereof is a sweet communion: but the perfection of bliss
will be, when the King shall say, Come.

\[2.\] The admission of the saints into the blessedness and kingdom of
the Father; Inherit the kingdom prepared for you.

First, the happiness they shall be possessed of is very rich; we are
told what it is by him who had reason to know it, having purchased it
for them, and possessed it himself.

1\. It is a kingdom; which is reckoned the most valuable possession on
earth, and includes the greatest wealth and honour. Those that inherit
kingdoms, wear all the glories of the crown, enjoy all the pleasures of
the court, and command the peculiar treasures of the provinces; yet this
is but a faint resemblance of the felicities of the saints in heaven.
They that here are beggars, prisoners, accounted as the off-scouring of
all things, shall then inherit a kingdom, [Psa
113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007.md); [Rev
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#026.md), [Rev
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027.md).

2\. It is a kingdom prepared: the happiness must needs be great, for it
is the product of the divine counsels. Note, There is great preparation
made for the entertainment of the saints in the kingdom of glory. The
Father designed it for them in his thoughts of love, and provided it for
them in the greatness of his wisdom and power. The Son purchased it for
them, and is entered as the fore-runner to prepare a place, [Joh
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#002.md). And the blessed Spirit, in
preparing them for the kingdom, in effect, is preparing it for them.

3\. It is prepared for them. This bespeaks, (1.) The suitableness of
this happiness; it is in all points adapted to the nature of a soul, and
to the new nature of a a sanctified soul. (2.) Their property and
interest in it. It is prepared on purpose for them; not only for such as
you, but for you, you by name, you personally and particularly, who were
chosen to salvation through sanctification.

4\. It is prepared from the foundation of the world. This happiness was
designed for the saints, and they for it, before time began, from all
eternity, [Eph 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004.md). The end, which is
last in execution, is first in intention. Infinite Wisdom had an eye to
the eternal glorification of the saints, from the first founding of the
creation: All things are for your sakes, [Co2
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#015.md). Or, it denotes the preparation
of the place of this happiness, which is to be the seat and habitation
of the blessed, in the very beginning of the work of creation, [Gen
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md). There in the heaven of heavens
the morning stars were singing together, when the foundations of the
earth were fastened, [Job 38:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#004.md).

Secondly, The tenure by which they shall hold and possess it is very
good, they shall come and inherit it. What we come to by inheritance, is
not got by any procurement of our own, but purely, as the lawyers
express it, by the act of God. It is God that makes heirs, heirs of
heaven. We come to an inheritance by virtue of our sonship, our
adoption; if children, then heirs. A title by inheritance is the
sweetest and surest title; it alludes to possessions in the land of
Canaan, which passed by inheritance, and would not be alienated longer
than to the year of Jubilee. Thus is the heavenly inheritance
indefeasible, and unalienable. Saints, in this world, are as heirs under
age, tutored and governed till the time appointed of the Father ([Gal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001.md), [Gal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#002).md); and then they shall be put in
full possession of that which now through grace they have a title to;
Come, and inherit it.

(2.) The ground of this ([Mat 25:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#035.md),
[Mat 25:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#036).md), For I was an hungered,
and ye gave me meat. We cannot hence infer that any good words of ours
merit the happiness of heaven, by any intrinsic worth or excellency in
them: our goodness extends not unto God; but it is plain that Jesus
Christ will judge the world by the same rule by which he governs it, and
therefore will reward those that have been obedient to that law; and
mention will be made of their obedience, not as their title, but as
their evidence of an interest in Christ, and his purchase. This
happiness will be adjudged to obedient believers, not upon a quantum
meruit - an estimate of merit, which supposes a proportion between the
work and the reward, but upon the promise of God purchased by Jesus
Christ, and the benefit of it secured under certain provisos and
limitations; and it is the purchase and promise that give the title, the
obedience is only the qualification of the person designed. An estate
made by deed or will upon condition, when the condition is performed
according to the true intent of the donor or testator, becomes absolute;
and then, though the title be built purely upon the deed or will, yet
the performing of the condition must be given in evidence: and so it
comes in here; for Christ is the Author of eternal salvation to those
only that obey him, and who patiently continue in well doing.

Now the good works here mentioned are such as we commonly call works of
charity to the poor: not but that many will be found on the right hand
who never were in a capacity to feed the hungry, or clothe the naked,
but were themselves fed and clothed by the charity of others; but one
instance of sincere obedience is put for all the rest, and it teaches us
this in general, that faith working by love is all in all in
Christianity; Show me thy faith by thy works; and nothing will abound to
a good account hereafter, but the fruits of righteousness in a good
conversation now. The good works here described imply three things,
which must be found in all that are saved.

\[1.\] Self-denial, and contempt of the world; reckoning the things of
the world no further good things, than as we are enabled to do good with
them: and those who have not wherewithal to do good, must show the same
disposition, by being contentedly and cheerfully poor. Those are fit for
heaven that are mortified to the earth.

\[2.\] Love to our brethren; which is the second great commandment, the
fulfilling of the law, and an excellent preparative for the world of
everlasting love. We must give proof of this love by our readiness to do
good, and to communicate; good wishes are but mockeries without good
works, [Jam 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#015.md), [Jam
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#016.md); [Jo1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#017.md). Those that have not to give,
must show the same disposition some other way.

\[3.\] A believing regard to Jesus Christ. That which is here rewarded
is the relieving of the poor for Christ's sake, out of love to him, and
with an eye to him. This puts an excellency upon the good work, when in
it we serve the Lord Christ, which those may do that work for their own
living, as well as those that help to keep others alive. See [Eph
6:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005.md). Those good works shall then be
accepted which are done in the name of the Lord Jesus, [Col
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#017.md).

I was hungry, that is, my disciples and followers were so, either by the
persecutions of enemies for well-doing, or by the common dispensations
of Providence; for in these things there is one event to the righteous
and wicked: and you gave them meat. Note, First, Providence so variously
orders and disposes of the circumstances of his people in this world, as
that while some are in a condition to give relief, others need it. It is
no new thing for those that are feasted with the dainties of heaven to
be hungry and thirsty, and to want daily food; for those that are at
home in God, to be strangers in a strange land; for those that have put
on Christ, to want clothes to keep them warm; for those that have
healthful souls, to have sickly bodies; and for those to be in prison,
that Christ has made free. Secondly, Works of charity and beneficence,
according as our ability is, are necessary to salvation; and there will
be more stress laid upon them in the judgment of the great day, than is
commonly imagined; these must be the proofs of our love, and of our
professed subjection to the gospel of Christ, [Co2
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#013.md). But they that show no mercy,
shall have judgment without mercy.

Now this reason is modestly excepted against by the righteous, but is
explained by the Judge himself.

1\. It is questioned by the righteous, [Mat
25:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#037.md). Not as if they were loth to
inherit the kingdom, or were ashamed of their good deeds, or had not the
testimony of their own consciences concerning them: but, (1.) The
expressions are parabolical, designed to introduce and impress these
great truths, that Christ has a mighty regard to works of charity, and
is especially pleased with kindnesses done to his people for his sake.
Or, (2.) They bespeak the humble admiration which glorified saints will
be filled with, to find such poor and worthless services, as theirs are,
so highly celebrated, and richly rewarded: Lord, when saw we thee an
hungered, and fed thee? Note, Gracious souls are apt to think meanly of
their own good deeds; especially as unworthy to be compared with the
glory that shall be revealed. Far from this is the temper of those who
said, Wherefore have we fasted, and thou seest not? [Isa
58:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#003.md). Saints in heaven will wonder
what brought them thither, and that God should so regard them and their
services. It even put Nathanael to the blush, to hear Christ's encomium
of him: Whence knowest thou me? [Joh
1:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#047.md), [Joh
1:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#048.md). See [Eph
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020.md). "When saw we thee an hungered?
We have seen the poor in distress many a time; but when saw we thee?"
Note, Christ is more among us than we think he is; surely the Lord is in
this place, by his word, his ordinances, his ministers, his Spirit, yea,
and his poor, and we know it not: When thou wert under the fig-tree, I
saw thee, [Joh 1:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#048.md).

2\. It is explained by the Judge himself ([Mat
25:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#040).md); Inasmuch as ye have done it to
these my brethren, to the least, to one of the least of them, ye have
done it unto me. The good works of the saints, when they are produced in
the great day, (1.) Shall all be remembered; and not the least, not one
of the least, overlooked, no not a cup of cold water. (2.) They shall be
interpreted most to their advantage, and the best construction that can
be put upon them. As Christ makes the best of their infirmities, so he
makes the most of their services.

We see what recompences Christ has for those that feed the hungry, and
clothe the naked; but what will become of the godly poor, that had not
wherewithal to do so? Must they be shut out? No, \[1.\] Christ will own
them, even the least of them, as his brethren; he will not be ashamed,
nor think it any disparagement to him, to call them brethren, [Heb
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011.md). In the height of his glory, he
will not disown his poor relations; Lazarus is there laid in his bosom,
as a friend, as a brother. Thus he will confess them, [Mat
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#032.md). \[2.\] He will take the
kindness done to them, as done to himself; Ye have done it unto me;
which shows a respect to the poor that were relieved, as well as to the
rich that did relieve them. Note, Christ espouses his people's cause,
and interests himself in their interests, and reckons himself received,
and love, and owned in them. If Christ himself were among us in poverty,
how readily would we relieve him? In prison, how frequently would we
visit him? We are ready to envy the honour they had, who ministered to
him of their substance, [Luk 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#003.md).
Wherever poor saints and poor ministers are, there Christ is ready to
receive our kindnesses in them, and they shall be put to his account.

2\. Here is the process concerning the wicked, those on the left hand.
And in that we have,

(1.) The sentence passed upon them, [Mat
25:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#041.md). It was a disgrace to be set on
the left hand; but that is not the worst of it, he shall say to them,
Depart from me, ye cursed. Every word has terror in it, like that of the
trumpet at mount Sinai, waxing louder and louder, every accent more and
more doleful, and exclusive of comfort.

\[1.\] To be so near to Christ was some satisfaction, though under his
frowns; but that will not be allowed, Depart from me. In this world they
were often called to come to Christ, to come for life and rest, but they
turned a deaf ear to his calls; justly therefore are they bid to depart
from Christ, that would not come to him. "Depart from me the Fountain of
all good, from me the Saviour, and therefore from all hope of salvation;
I will never have any thing more to say to you, or do with you." Here
they said to the Almighty, Depart from us; then he will choose their
delusions, and say to them, Depart from me. Note, It is the hell of hell
to depart from Christ.

\[2.\] If they must depart, and depart from Christ, might they not be
dismissed with a blessing, with one kind and compassionate word at
least? No, Depart, ye cursed, They that would not come to Christ, to
inherit a blessing, must depart from him under the burthen of a curse,
that curse of the law on every one that breaks it, [Gal
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010.md). As they loved cursing, so it
shall come unto them. But observe, The righteous are called the blessed
of my Father; for their blessedness is owing purely to the grace of God
and his blessing, but the wicked are called only ye cursed, for their
damnation is of themselves. Hath God sold them? No, they have sold
themselves, have laid themselves under the curse, [Isa
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001.md).

\[3.\] If they must depart, and depart with a curse, may they not go
into some place of ease and rest? Will it not be misery enough for them
to bewail their loss? No, there is a punishment of sense as well as
loss; they must depart into fire, into torment as grievous as that of
fire is to the body, and much more. This fire is the wrath of the
eternal God fastening upon the guilty souls and consciences of sinners
that have made themselves fuel for it. Our God is a consuming fire, and
sinners fall immediately into his hands, [Heb
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#031.md); [Rom
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#008.md), [Rom
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#009.md).

\[4.\] If into fire, may it not be some light or gentle fire? No, it is
prepared fire; it is a torment ordained of old, [Isa
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033.md). The damnation of sinners is
often spoken of as an act of the divine power; he is able to cast into
hell. In the vessels of wrath he makes his power known; it is a
destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his
power. In it shall be seen what a provoked God can do to make a
provoking creature miserable.

\[5.\] If into fire, prepared fire, O let it be but of short
continuance, let them but pass through fire; no, the fire of God's wrath
will be an everlasting fire; a fire, that, fastening and preying upon
immortal souls, can never go out for want of fuel; and, being kindled
and kept burning by the wrath of an immortal God, can never go out for
want of being blown and stirred up; and, the streams of mercy and grace
being for ever excluded, there is nothing to extinguish it. If a drop of
water be denied to cool the tongue, buckets of water will never be
granted to quench this flame.

\[6.\] If they must be doomed to such a state of endless misery, yet may
they not have some good company there? No, none but the devil and his
angels, their sworn enemies, that helped to bring them to this misery,
and will triumph over them in it. They served the devil while they
lived, and therefore are justly sentenced to be where he is, as those
that served Christ, are taken to be with him where he is. It is terrible
to lie in a house haunted with devils; what will it be then to be
companions with them for ever? Observe here, First, Christ intimates
that there is one that is the prince of the devils, the ring-leader of
the rebellion, and that the rest are his angels, his messengers, by
whose agency he supports his kingdom. Christ and his angels will in that
day triumph over the dragon and his, [Rev
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#007.md), [Rev
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#008.md). Secondly, The fire is said to be
prepared, not primarily for the wicked, as the kingdom is prepared for
the righteous; but it was originally intended for the devil and his
angels. If sinners make themselves associates with Satan by indulging
their lusts, they may thank themselves if they become sharers in that
misery which was prepared for him and his associates. Calvin notes upon
this, that therefore the torment of the damned is said to be prepared
for the devil and his angels, to cut off all hope of escaping it; the
devil and his angels are already made prisoners in the pit, and can
worms of the earth think to escape?

(2.) The reason of this sentence assigned. God's judgments are all just,
and he will be justified in them. He is Judge himself, and therefore the
heavens shall declare his righteousness.

Now, \[1.\] All that is charged upon them, on which the sentence is
grounded, is, omission; as, before, the servant was condemned, not for
wasting his talent, but for burying it; so here, he doth not say, "I was
hungry and thirsty, for you took my meat and drink from me; I was a
stranger, for you banished me; naked, for you stripped me; in prison,
for you laid me there:" but, "When I was in these distresses, you were
so selfish, so taken up with your own ease and pleasure, made so much of
your labour, and were so loth to part with your money, that you did not
minister as you might have done to my relief and succour. You were like
those epicures that were at ease in Zion, and were not grieved for the
affliction of Joseph," [Amo 6:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#004.md).
Note, Omissions are the ruin of thousands.

\[2.\] It is the omission of works of charity to the poor. They are not
sentenced for omitting their sacrifices and burnt-offerings (they
abounded in these, [Psa 50:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008).md), but for
omitting the weightier matter of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith.
The Ammonites and Moabites were excluded the sanctuary, because they met
not Israel with bread and water, [Deu
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003.md), [Deu
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#004.md). Note, Uncharitableness to the
poor is a damning sin. If we will not be brought to works of charity by
the hope of reward, let us be influenced by fear of punishment; for they
shall have judgment without mercy, that have showed no mercy. Observe,
He doth not say, "I was sick, and you did not cure me; in prison, and
you did not release me" (perhaps that was more than they could do); but,
"You visited me not, which you might have done." Note, Sinners will be
condemned, at the great day, for the omission of that good which it was
in the power of their hand to do. But if the doom of the uncharitable be
so dreadful, how much more intolerable will the doom of the cruel be,
the doom of persecutors! Now this reason of the sentence is.

First, Objected against by the prisoners ([Mat
25:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#044).md); Lord, when saw we thee an
hungered, or athirst? Condemned sinners, though they have no plea that
will bear them out, will yet in vain offer at excuses. Now. 1. The
manner of their pleading bespeaks their present precipitation. They cut
it short, as men in haste; when saw we thee hungry, or thirsty, or
naked? They care not to repeat the charge, as conscious to themselves of
their own guilt, and unable to bear the terrors of the judgment. Nor
will they have time allowed them to insist upon such frivolous pleas;
for it is all (as we say) but "trifling with the court." 2. The matter
of their plea bespeaks their former inconsideration of that which they
might have known, but would not till now that it was too late. They that
had slighted and persecuted poor Christians, would not own that they had
slighted and persecuted Christ: no, they never intended any affront to
him, nor expected that so great a matter would have been made of it.
They imagined it was only a company of poor, weak, silly, and
contemptible people, who made more ado than needed about religion, that
they put those slights upon; but they who do so, will be made to know,
either in the day of their conversion, as Paul, or of their
condemnation, as these here, that it was Jesus whom they persecuted.
And, if they say, Behold, we knew it not: doth not he that pondereth the
heart consider it? [Pro 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#011.md), [Pro
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#012.md).

Secondly, Justified by the Judge, who will convince all the ungodly of
the hard speeches spoken against him in those that are his, [Jde
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#015.md). He goes by this rule ([Mat
25:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#045).md); Inasmuch as ye did it not to
one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. Note, What is done
against the faithful disciples and followers of Christ, even the least
of them, he takes as done against himself. He is reproached and
persecuted in them, for they are reproached and persecuted for his sake,
and in all their afflictions he is afflicted. He that touches them,
touches him in a part no less tender than the apple of his eye.

Lastly, Here is the execution of both these sentences, [Mat
25:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#046.md). Execution is the life of the
law, and Christ will take care that that be done according to the
sentence.

1\. The wicked shall go away into everlasting punishment. Sentence will
then be executed speedily, and no reprieve granted, nor any time allowed
to move in arrest of judgment. The execution of the wicked is first
mentioned; for first the tares are gathered and burned. Note, (1.) The
punishment of the wicked in the future state will be an everlasting
punishment, for that state is an unalterable state. It can neither be
thought that sinners should change their own natures, nor that God
should give his grace to change them, when in this world the day of
grace was misspent, the Spirit of grace resisted, and the means of grace
abused and baffled. (2.) The wicked shall be made to go away into that
punishment; not that they will go voluntarily, no, they are driven from
light into darkness; but it bespeaks an irresistible conviction of
guilt, and a final despair of mercy.

2\. The righteous shall go away into life eternal; that is, they shall
inherit the kingdom, [Mat 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034.md). Note,
(1.) Heaven is life, it is all happiness. The life of the soul results
from its union with God by the mediation of Jesus Christ, as that of the
body from its union with the soul by the animal spirits. The heavenly
life consists in the vision and fruition of God, in a perfect conformity
to him, and an immediate uninterrupted communion with him. (2.) It is
eternal life. There is no death to put a period to the life itself, nor
old age to put a period to the comfort of it, or any sorrow to embitter
it. Thus life and death, good and evil, the blessing and the curse, are
set before us, that we may choose our way; and so shall our end be. Even
the heathen had some notion of these different states of good and bad in
the other world. Cicero in his Tusculan Questions, lib. 1, brings in
Socrates thus speaking, Duae sunt viae, duplicesque cursus corpore
exeuntium: nam qui se vitiis humanis contaminarunt, et libidinibus se
tradiderunt, iis devium quoddam iter est, seclusum consilio deorum; qui
autem se integros castosque servarunt, quibusque fuerit minima cum
corporibus contagio, suntque in corporibus humanis vitam imitati deorum,
iis ad illos a quibus sunt profecti facile patet reditus - Two paths
open before those who depart out of the body. Such as have contaminated
themselves with human vices, and yielded to their lusts, occupy a path
that conducts them far from the assembly and council of the gods; but
the upright and chaste, such as have been least defiled by the flesh,
and have imitated, while in the body, the gods, these find it easy to
return to the sublime beings from whom they came.
