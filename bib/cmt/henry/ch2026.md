### [2 Chronicles Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 26:0</span></span>

This chapter gives us an account of the reign of Uzziah (Azariah he was
called in the Kings) more fully than we had it before, though it was
long, and in some respects illustrious, yet it was very briefly related,
[Kg2 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#021.md); [Kg2
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#001.md), etc. Here is, I. His good
character in general ([Ch2 26:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001).md) II.
His great prosperity in his wars, his buildings, and all the affairs of
his kingdom ([Ch2 26:6-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006).md). III. His
presumption in invading the priests' office, for which he was struck
with a leprosy, and confined by it ([Ch2
26:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016).md) even to his death ([Ch2
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#022.md), [Ch2
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#023).md).

[2 Chronicles 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 26:1</span></span>

We have here an account of two things concerning Uzziah: -

I. His piety. In this he was not very eminent or zealous; yet he did
that which was right in the sight of the Lord. He kept up the pure
worship of the true God as his father did, and was better than his
father, inasmuch as we have no reason to think he ever worshipped idols
as his father did, no, not in his latter days, when his heart was lifted
up. It is said ([Ch2 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#005).md), He sought
God in the days of Zechariah, who, some think, was the son of the
Zechariah whom his grandfather Joash slew. This Zechariah was one that
had understanding in the visions of God, either the visions which he
himself was favoured with or the visions of the preceding prophets. He
was well versed in prophecy, and conversed much with the upper world,
was an intelligent, devout, good man; and, it seems, had great influence
with Uzziah. Happy are the great men who have such about them and are
willing to be advised by them; but unhappy those who seek God only while
they have such with them and have not a principle in themselves to bear
them out to the end.

II\. His prosperity.

1\. In general, as long as he sought the Lord, and minded religion, God
made him to prosper. Note, (1.) Those only prosper whom God makes to
prosper; for prosperity is his gift. (2.) Religion and piety are very
friendly to outward prosperity. Many have found and owned this, that as
long as they sought the Lord and kept close to their duty they
prospered; but since they forsook God every thing has gone cross.

2\. Here are several particular instances of his prosperity: - (1.) His
success in his wars: God helped him ([Ch2
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#007).md), and then he triumphed over the
Philistines (those old enemies of God's people), demolished the
fortifications of their cities, and put garrisons of his own among them,
[Ch2 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006.md). He obliged the Ammonites to
pay him tribute, [Ch2 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#008.md). He made
all quiet about him, and kept them in awe. (2.) The greatness of his
fame and reputation. His name was celebrated throughout all the
neighbouring countries ([Ch2 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#008).md) and
it was a good name, a name for good things with God and good people.
This is true fame, and makes a man truly honourable. (3.) His buildings.
While he acted offensively abroad, he did not neglect the defence of his
kingdom at home, but built towers in Jerusalem and fortified them, [Ch2
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#009.md). Much of the wall of Jerusalem
was in his father's time broken down, particularly at the corner gate.
But his best fortification of Jerusalem was his close adherence to the
worship of God: if his father had not forsaken this the wall of
Jerusalem would not have been broken down. While he fortified the city,
he did not forget the country, but built towers in the desert too ([Ch2
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#010).md), to protect the country people
from the inroads of the plunderers, bands of whom sometimes alarmed them
and plundered them, as [Ch2 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016.md).
(4.) His husbandry. He dealt much in cattle and corn, employed many
hands, and got much wealth by his dealing; for he took a pleasure in it:
he loved husbandry ([Ch2 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#010).md), and
probably did himself inspect his affairs in the country, which was no
disparagement to him, but an advantage, as it encouraged industry among
his subjects. It is an honour to the husbandman's calling that one of
the most illustrious princes of the house of David followed it and loved
it. He was not one of those that delight in war, nor did he addict
himself to sport and pleasure, but delighted in the innocent and quiet
employments of the husbandman. (5.) His standing armies. He had, as it
should seem, two military establishments. \[1.\] A host of fighting men
that were to make excursions abroad. These went out to war by bands,
[Ch2 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#011.md). They fetched in spoil from
the neighbouring countries by way of reprisal for the depredations they
had so often made upon Judah, \[2.\] Another army for guards and
garrisons, that were ready to defend the country in case it should be
invaded, [Ch2 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#012.md), [Ch2
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#013.md). So great were their number and
valour that they made war with mighty power; no enemy durst face them,
or, at least, could stand before them. Men unarmed can do little in war.
Uzziah therefore furnished himself with a great armoury, whence his
soldiers were supplied with arms offensive and defensive ([Ch2
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#014).md), spears, bows, and slings,
shields, helmets, and habergeons: swords are not mentioned, because it
is probable that every man had a sword of his own, which he wore
constantly. Engines were invented, in his time, for annoying besiegers
with darts and stones shot from the towers and bulwarks, [Ch2
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#015.md). What a pity it is that the wars
and fightings which come from men's lusts have made it necessary for
cunning men to employ their skill in inventing instruments of death.

[2 Chronicles 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 26:16</span></span>

Here is the only blot we find on the name of king Uzziah, and it is such
a one as lies not on any other of the kings. Whoredom, murder,
oppression, persecution, and especially idolatry, gave characters to the
bad kings and some of them blemishes to the good ones, David himself not
excepted, witness the matter of Uriah. But we find not Uzziah charged
with any of these; and yet he transgressed against the Lord his God, and
fell under the marks of his displeasure in consequence, not, as other
kings, in vexatious wars or rebellions, but an incurable disease.

I. His sin was invading the priest's office. The good way is one;
by-paths are many. The transgression of his predecessors was forsaking
the temple of the Lord, flying off from it ([Ch2
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#018).md), and burning incense upon
idolatrous altars, [Ch2 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#014.md). His was
intruding into the temple of the Lord further than was allowed him, and
attempting him to burn incense upon the altar of God, for which, it is
likely, he pretended an extraordinary zeal and affection. See how hard
it is to avoid one extreme and not run into another.

1\. That which was at the bottom of his sin was pride of heart, a lust
that ruins more than any other whatsoever ([Ch2
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016).md): When he was strong (and he was
marvellously helped by the good providence of God till he was so, [Ch2
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#015).md), when he had grown very great
and considerable in wealth, interest, and power, instead of lifting up
the name of God in gratitude to him who had done so much for him, his
heart was lifted up to his destruction. Thus the prosperity of fools, by
puffing them up with pride, destroys them. Now that he had done so much
business, and won so much honour, he began to think no business, no
honour, too great or too good for him, no, not that of the priesthood
Men's pretending to forbidden knowledge, and exercising themselves in
things too high for them, are owing to the pride of their heart, and the
fleshly mind they are vainly puffed up with.

2\. His sin was going into the temple of the Lord to burn incense,
probably on some solemn feast day, or when he himself had some special
occasion for supplicating the divine favour. What could move him to this
piece of presumption, or put it into his head, I cannot conjecture. None
of all his predecessors, not the best, not the worst, attempted it. The
law, he knew, was express against him, and there was no usage or
precedent for him. He could not pretend any necessity, as there was for
David's eating the show-bread. (1.) Perhaps he fancied the priests did
not do their office so dexterously, decently, and devoutly, as they
ought, and he could do it better. Or, (2.) He observed that the
idolatrous kings did themselves burn incense at the altars of their
gods; his father did so, and Jeroboam ([Kg1
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#001).md), an ambition of which honour was
perhaps one thing that tempted them from the house of God, where it was
not permitted them; and he, being resolved to cleave to God's altar,
would try to break through this restraint and come as near it as the
idolatrous kings did to their altars. But it is called a transgression
against the Lord his God. He was not content with the honours God had
put upon him, but would usurp those that were forbidden him, like our
first parents.

3\. He was opposed in this attempt by the chief priest and other priests
that attended and assisted him, [Ch2
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#017.md), [Ch2
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#018.md). They were ready to burn incense
for the king, according to the duty of their place; but, when he offered
to do it himself, they plainly let him know that he meddled with that
which did not belong to him, and that it was at his peril. They did not
resist him by laying violent hands on him, though they were valiant men,
but by reasoning with him and showing him, (1.) That it was not lawful
for him to burn incense: "It appertaineth not to thee, O Uzziah! but to
the priests, whose birthright it is, as sons of Aaron, and who are
consecrated to the service." Aaron and his sons were appointed by the
law to burn incense, [Exo 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#007.md). See
[Deu 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#010.md); [Ch1
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#013.md). David had blessed the people
and Solomon and Jehoshaphat had prayed with them and preached to them.
Uzziah might have done this, and it would have been to his praise; but
as for burning incense, that service was to be performed by the priests
only. The kingly and priestly offices were separated by the law of
Moses, not to be united again but in the person of the Messiah. If
Uzziah did intend to honour God, and gain acceptance with him, in what
he did, he was quite out in his aim; for, being a service purely of
divine institution, he could not expect it should be accepted unless it
were done in the way and by the hands that God had appointed. (2.) That
it was not safe. It shall not be for thy honour from the Lord God. More
is implied: "It will be thy disgrace, and it is at thy peril." The law
runs expressly against all strangers that came nigh ([Num
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#010.md), [Num
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#007).md), that is, all that were not
priests. Korah and his accomplices, though Levites, paid dearly for
offering to burn incense, which was the work of the priests only, [Num
16:35](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#035.md). The incense of our prayers must
be by faith put into the hands of our Lord Jesus, the great high priest
of our profession, else we cannot expect it should be accepted by God,
[Rev 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003.md).

4\. He fell into a passion with the priests that reproved him, and would
push forward to do what he intended notwithstanding ([Ch2
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#019).md): Uzziah was wroth, and would
not part with the censer out of his hand. He took it ill to be checked,
and would not bear interference. Nitimur in vetitum - We are prone to do
what is forbidden.

II\. His punishment was an incurable leprosy, which rose up in his
forehead while he was contending with the priests. If he had submitted
to the priests' admonition, acknowledged his error, and gone back, all
would have been well; but when he was wroth with the priests, and fell
foul upon them, then God was wroth with him and smote him with a plague
of leprosy. Josephus says that he threatened the priests with death if
they opposed him, and that then the earth shook, the roof of the temple
opened, and through the cleft a beam of the sun darted directly upon the
king's face, wherein immediately the leprosy appeared. And some
conjecture that that was the earthquake in the days of Uzziah which we
read of [Amo 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md) and [Zac
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005.md). Now this sudden stroke, 1. Ended
the controversy between him and the priests; for, when the leprosy
appeared, they were emboldened to thrust him out of the temple; nay, he
himself hasted to go out, because the Lord had smitten him with a
disease which was in a particular manner a token of his displeasure, and
which he knew secluded him from common converse with men, much more from
the altar of God. He would not be convinced by what the priests said,
but God took an effectual course to convince him. If presumptuous men
will not be made to see their error by the judgments of God's mouth,
they shall be made to see it by the judgments of his hand. It evinced
some religious fear of God in the heart of this king, even in the midst
of his transgression, that, as soon as he found God was angry with him,
he not only let fall his attempt, but retired with the utmost
precipitation. Though he strove with the priests, he would not strive
with his Maker. 2. It remained a lasting punishment of his
transgression; for he continued a leper to the day of his death, shut up
in confinement, and shut out from society, and forced to leave it to his
son to manage all his business, [Ch2
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#021.md). Thus God gave an instance of
his resisting the proud and of his jealousy for the purity and honour of
his own institutions; thus he gave fair warning even to great and good
men to know and keep their distance, and not to intrude into those
things which they have not seen; and thus he gave Uzziah a loud and
constant call to repentance, and a long space to repent, which we have
reason to hope he improved. He had been a man of much business in the
world; but being taken off from that, and confined to a separate house,
he had leisure to think of another world and prepare for it. By this
judgment upon the king God intended to possess the people with a great
veneration for the temple, the priesthood, and other sacred things,
which they had been apt to think meanly of. While the king was a leper,
he was as good as dead, dead while he lived, and buried alive; and so
the law was, in effect, answered, that the stranger who cometh nigh
shall be put to death. The disgrace survived him; for, when he was dead,
they would not bury him in the sepulchres of the kings because he was a
leper, which stained all his other glory. 3. It was a punishment that
answered the sin as face does face in a glass. (1.) Pride was at the
bottom of his transgression, and thus God humbled him and put dishonour
upon him. (2.) He invaded the office of the priests in contempt of them,
and God struck him with a disease which in a particular manner made him
subject to the inspection and sentence of the priests; for to them
pertained the judgment of the leprosy, [Deu
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#008). (3..md) He thrust himself into the
temple of God, whither the priests only had admission, and for that was
thrust out of the very courts of the temple, into which the meanest of
his subjects that was ceremonially clean had free access. (4.) He
confronted the priests that faced him and opposed his presumption, and
for that the leprosy rose in his forehead, which, in Miriam's case, is
compared to her father's spitting in her face, [Num
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#014). (5..md) He invaded the dignity of
the priesthood, which he had no right to, and for that he was deprived
even of his royal dignity, which he had a right to. Those that covet
forbidden honours forfeit allowed ones. Adam, by catching at the tree of
knowledge of which he might not eat, debarred himself from the tree of
life, of which he might have eaten. Let all that read it say, The Lord
is righteous.
