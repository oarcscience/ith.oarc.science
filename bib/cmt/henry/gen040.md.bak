### [Genesis Chapter 40](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 40:0</span></span>

In this chapter things are working, though slowly, towards Joseph's
advancement. I. Two of Pharaoh's servants are committed to prison, and
there to Joseph's care, and so become witnesses of his extraordinary
conduct ([Gen 40:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#001).md). II. They
dreamed each of them a dream, which Joseph interpreted ([Gen
40:5-19](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#005).md), and the event verified the
interpretation ([Gen 40:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#020).md), and so
they became witnesses of his extraordinary skill. III. Joseph recommends
his case to one of them, whose preferment he foresaw ([Gen
40:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#014.md), [Gen
40:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#015).md), but in vain ([Gen
40:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#023).md).

[Genesis 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 40:1</span></span>

We should not have had this story of Pharaoh's butler and baker recorded
in scripture if it had not been serviceable to Joseph's preferment. The
world stands for the sake of the church, and is governed for its good.
Observe, 1. Two of the great officers of Pharaoh's court, having
offended the king, are committed to prison. Note, High places are
slippery places; nothing more uncertain than the favour of princes.
Those that make God's favour their happiness, and his service their
business, will find him a better Master than Pharaoh was, and not so
extreme to mark what they do amiss. Many conjectures there are
concerning the offence of these servants of Pharaoh; some make it no
less than an attempt to take away his life, others no more than the
casual lighting of a fly into his cup and a little sand into his bread.
Whatever it was, Providence by this means brought them into the prison
where Joseph was. 2. The captain of the guard himself, who was Potiphar,
charged Joseph with them ([Gen 40:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#004).md),
which intimates that he began now to be reconciled to him, and perhaps
to be convinced of his innocence, though he durst not release him for
fear of disobliging his wife. John Baptist must lose his head, to please
Herodias.

[Genesis 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 40:5</span></span>

Observe, I. The special providence of God, which filled the heads of
these two prisoners with unusual dreams, such as made extraordinary
impressions upon them, and carried with them evidences of a divine
origin, both in one night. Note, God has immediate access to the spirits
of men, which he can make serviceable to his own purposes whenever he
pleases, quite beyond the intention of those concerned. To him all
hearts are open, and anciently he spoke not only to his own people, but
to others, in dreams, [Job 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#015.md).
Things to come were thus foretold, but very obscurely.

II\. The impression which was made upon these prisoners by their dreams
([Gen 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#006).md): They were sad. It was not
the prison that made them sad (they were pretty well used to that, and
perhaps lived jovially there), but the dream. Note, God has more ways
than one to sadden the spirits of those that are to be made sad. Those
sinners that are hardy enough under outward troubles, and will not yield
to them, yet God can find out a way to punish; he can take off their
wheels, by wounding their spirits, and laying loads upon them.

III\. Joseph's great tenderness and compassion towards them. He enquired
with concern, Wherefore look you so sadly today? [Gen
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#007.md). Joseph was their keeper, and in
that office he was mild. Note, It becomes us to take cognizance of the
sorrows even of those that are under our check. Joseph was their
companion in tribulation, he was now a prisoner with them, and had been
a dreamer too. Note, Communion in sufferings helps to work compassion
towards those that do suffer. Let us learn hence, 1. To concern
ourselves in the sorrows and troubles of others, and to enquire into the
reason of the sadness of our brethren's countenances; we should be often
considering the tears of the oppressed, [Ecc
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md). It is some relief to those that
are in trouble to be taken notice of. 2. To enquire into the causes of
our own sorrow, "Wherefore do I look so sadly? Is there a reason? Is it
a good reason? Is there not a reason for comfort sufficient to balance
it, whatever it is? Why art thou cast down, O my soul?"

IV\. The dreams themselves, and the interpretation of them. That which
troubled these prisoners was that being confined they could not have
recourse to the diviners of Egypt who pretended to interpret dreams:
There is no interpreter here in the prison, [Gen
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#008.md). Note, There are interpreters
which those that are in prison and sorrow should wish to have with them,
to instruct them in the meaning and design of Providence (Elihu alludes
to such, when he says, If there be an interpreter, one among a thousand,
to show unto man his uprightness, [Job
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023.md), [Job
33:24](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#024).md), interpreters to guide their
consciences, not to satisfy their curiosity. Joseph hereupon directed
them which way to look: Do not interpretations belong to God? He means
the God whom he worshipped, to the knowledge of whom he endeavours
hereby to lead them. Note, It is God's prerogative to foretel things to
come, [Isa 46:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#010.md). He must therefore
have the praise of all the gifts of foresight which men have, ordinary
or extraordinary. Joseph premises a caveat against his own praise, and
is careful to transmit the glory to God, as Daniel, [Dan
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#030.md). Joseph suggests, "If
interpretations belong to God, he is a free agent, and may communicate
the power to whom he pleases, and therefore tell me your dreams." Now,
1. The chief butler's dream was a happy presage of his enlargement, and
re-advancement, within three days; and so Joseph explained it to him,
[Gen 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#012.md), [Gen
40:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#013.md). Probably it had been usual with
him to press the full-ripe grapes immediately into Pharaoh's cup, the
simplicity of that age not being acquainted with the modern arts of
making the wine fine. Observe, Joseph foretold the chief butler's
deliverance, but he did not foresee his own. He had long before dreamt
of his own honour, and the obeisance which his brethren should do to
him, with the remembrance of which he must now support himself, without
any new or fresh discoveries. The visions that are for the comfort of
God's saints are for a great while to come, and relate to things that
are very far off, while the foresights of others, like this recorded
there, look but three days before them. 2. The chief baker's dream
portended his ignominious death, [Gen
40:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#018.md), [Gen
40:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#019.md). The happy interpretation of the
other's dream encouraged him to relate his. Thus hypocrites, when they
hear good things promised to good Christians, would put in for a share,
though they have no part nor lot in the matter. It was not Joseph's
fault that he brought him no better tidings. Ministers are but
interpreters, they cannot make the thing otherwise than it is; if
therefore they deal faithfully, and their message prove unpleasing, it
is not their fault. Bad dreams cannot expect a good interpretation.

V. The improvement Joseph made of this opportunity to get a friend at
court, [Gen 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#014.md), [Gen
40:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#015.md). He modestly bespoke the favour
of the chief butler, whose preferment he foretold: But think of me when
it shall be well with thee. Though the respect paid to Joseph made the
prison as easy to him as a prison could be, yet none can blame him for
being desirous of liberty. See here, 1. What a modest representation he
makes of his own case, [Gen 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#015.md). He
does not reflect upon his brethren that sold him; he only says, I was
stolen out of the land of the Hebrews, that is, unjustly sent thence, no
matter where the fault was. Nor does he reflect on the wrong done him in
this imprisonment by his mistress that was his prosecutrix, and his
master that was his judge; but mildly avers his own innocence: Here have
I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon. Note, When we
are called to vindicate ourselves we should carefully avoid, as much as
may be, speaking ill of others. Let us be content to prove ourselves
innocent, and not be fond of upbraiding others with their guilt. 2. What
a modest request he makes to the chief butler: "Only, think of me. Pray
do me a kindness, if it lie in your way." And his particular petition
is, Bring me out of this house. He does not say, "Bring me into
Pharaoh's house, get me a place at court." No, he begs for enlargement,
not preferment. Note, Providence sometimes designs the greatest honours
for those that least covet or expect them.

[Genesis 40:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 40:20</span></span>

Here is, 1. The verifying of Joseph's interpretation of the dreams, on
the very day prefixed. The chief butler and baker were both advanced,
one to his office, the other to the gallows, and both at the three days'
end. Note, Very great changes, both for the better and for the worse,
often happen in a very little time, so sudden are the revolutions of the
wheel of nature. The occasion of giving judgement severally upon their
case was the solemnizing of Pharaoh's birthday, on which, all his
servants being obliged by custom to attend him, these two came to be
enquired after, and the cause of their commitment looked into. The
solemnizing of the birthday of princes has been an ancient piece of
respect done them; and if it be not abused, as Jeroboam's was ([Hos
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#005).md), and Herod's ([Mar
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#021).md), is a usage innocent enough: and
we may all profitably take notice of our birthdays, with thankfulness
for the mercies of our birth, sorrow for the sinfulness of it, and an
expectation of the day of our death as better than the day of our birth.
On Pharaoh's birthday he lifted up the head of these two prisoners, that
is, arraigned and tried them (when Naboth was tried he was set on high
among the people, [Kg1 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#009).md), and he
restored the chief butler, and hanged the chief baker. If the butler was
innocent and the baker guilty, we must own the equity of Providence in
clearing up the innocency of the innocent, and making the sin of the
guilty to find him out. If both were either equally innocent or equally
guilty, it is an instance of the arbitrariness of such great princes as
pride themselves in that power which Nebuchadnezzar set up for ([Dan
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#019.md), whom he would he slew, and whom
he would he kept alive), forgetting that there is a higher than they, to
whom they are accountable. 2. The disappointing of Joseph's expectation
from the chief butler: He remembered not Joseph, but forgot him, [Gen
40:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#023). (1..md) See here an instance of
base ingratitude; Joseph had deserved well at his hands, had ministered
to him, sympathized with him, helped him to a favourable interpretation
of his dream, had recommended himself to him as an extraordinary person
upon all accounts; and yet he forgot him. We must not think it strange
if in this world we have hatred shown us for our love, and slights for
our respects. (2.) See how apt those that are themselves at ease are to
forget others in distress. Perhaps it is in allusion to this story that
the prophet speaks of those that drink wine in bowls, and are not
grieved for the affliction of Joseph, [Amo
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#006.md). Let us learn hence to cease from
man. Joseph perhaps depended too much upon his interest in the chief
butler, and promised himself too much from him; he learned by his
disappointment to trust in God only. We cannot expect too little from
man nor too much from God.

Some observe the resemblance between Joseph and Christ in this story.
Joseph's fellow-sufferers were like the two thieves that were crucified
with Christ - the one saved, the other condemned. (It is Dr. Lightfoot's
remark, from Mr. Broughton.) One of these, when Joseph said to him,
Remember me when it shall be well with thee, forget him; but one of
those, when he said to Christ, Remember me when thou comest into thy
kingdom, was not forgotten. We justly blame the chief butler's
ingratitude to Joseph, yet we conduct ourselves much more disingenuously
towards the Lord Jesus. Joseph had but foretold the chief butler's
enlargement, but Christ wrought out ours, mediated with the King of
kings for us; yet we forget him, though often reminded of him, though we
have promised never to forget him: thus ill do we requite him, like
foolish people and unwise.
