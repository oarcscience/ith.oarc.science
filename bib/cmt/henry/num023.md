### [Numbers Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 23:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have Balak and Balaam busy at work to do Israel a
mischief, and, for ought that appears, neither Moses nor the elders of
Israel know any thing of the matter, nor are in a capacity to break the
snare; but God, who keeps Israel, and neither slumbers nor sleeps,
baffles the attempt, without any intercession or contrivance of theirs.
Here is, I. The first attempt to curse Israel. 1. The preparation made
for it by sacrifice ([Num 23:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#001).md). 2.
The contrary instruction God gave Balaam ([Num
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#004.md), [Num
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#005).md). 3. The blessing Balaam was
compelled to pronounce upon Israel, instead of a curse ([Num
23:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#007).md). 4. The great disappointment
of Balak ([Num 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#011.md), [Num
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#012).md). II. The second attempt, in the
same manner made, and in the same manner frustrated ([Num
23:13-26](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#013).md). III. Preparations made for
a third attempt ([Num 23:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#027).md), the
issue of which we have in the next chapter.

[Numbers 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 23:1</span></span>

Here is, I. Great preparation made for the cursing of Israel. That which
was aimed at was to engage the God of Israel to forsake them, and either
to be on Moab's side or to stand neuter. O the sottishness of
superstition, to imagine that God will be at men's beck! Balaam and
Balak think to bribe him with altars and sacrifices, offered without any
warrant or institution of his: as if he would eat the flesh of bulls or
drink the blood of goats. Ridiculous nonsense, to think that these would
please God, and gain his favour, when there could be in them no exercise
either of faith or obedience! Yet, it should seem, they offered these
sacrifices to the God of heaven the supreme Numen - Divinity, and not to
any of their local deities. But the multiplying of altars was an
instance of their degeneracy from the religion of their ancestors, and
their apostasy to idolatry; for those that multiplied altars multiplied
gods. Ephraim made many altars to sin, [Hos
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011.md). Thus they liked not to retain
God in their knowledge, but became vain in their imaginations; and yet
presumptuously expected hereby to gain God over to them from Israel, who
had his sanctuary among them, and his anointed altar. Observe here, 1.
How very imperious Balaam was, proud to have the command of a king and
to give law to princes. Such is the spirit of that wicked one who exalts
himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped. With what
authority does Balaam give orders! Build me here (in the place I have
pitched upon) seven altars, of stone or turf. Thus he covers his malice
against Israel with a show of devotion, but his sacrifice was an
abomination, being brought with such a wicked mind, [Pro
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#027.md). That which he aimed at was not
to honour God with the sacrifices of righteousness, but to enrich
himself with the wages of unrighteousness. 2. How very obsequious Balak
was. The altars were presently built, and the sacrifices prepared, the
best of the sort, seven bullocks and seven rams. Balak makes no
objection to the charge, nor does he snuff at it, or think it either a
weariness or a disparagement to stand by his burnt-offering as Balaam
ordered him.

II\. The turning of the curse into a blessing, by the overruling power
of God, in love to Israel, which is the account Moses gives of it, [Deu
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#005.md).

1\. God puts the blessing into the mouth of Balaam. While the sacrifices
were burning, Balaam retired; he went solitary, into some dark grove on
the top of the high place, [Deu 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003.md),
marg. Thus much he knew, that solitude gives a good opportunity for
communion with God; those that would meet with him must retire from the
world, and the business and conversation of it, and love to be private,
reckoning themselves never less alone than when alone, because the
Father is with them. Enter therefore into thy closet, and shut the door,
and be assured that God will meet thee if thou seek him in the due
order. But Balaam retired with a peradventure only, having some thoughts
that God might meet him; but being conscious to himself of guilt, and
knowing that God had lately met him in anger, he had reason to speak
doubtfully: Peradventure the Lord will come to meet me, [Num
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#003.md). But let not such a man think
that he shall receive any favour from God. Nay, it should seem, though
he pretended to go and meet with God, he really designed to use
enchantments; see [Num 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#001.md). But,
whatever he intended. God designed to serve his own glory by him, and
therefore met Balaam, [Num 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#004.md). What
communion has light with darkness? No friendly communion, we may be
sure. Balaam's way was still perverse, and God was still an adversary to
him; but, Balak having chosen him for his oracle, God would constrain
him to utter such a confession, to the honour of god and Israel, as
should render those for ever inexcusable who should appear in arms
against them. When Balaam was aware that God met him, probably by an
angel, he boasted of his performances: I have prepared seven altars, and
offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram. How had he done it? It
cost him nothing; it was done at Balak's expense; yet, (1.) He boasts of
it, as if he had done some mighty thing. The acts of devotion which are
done in hypocrisy are commonly reflected upon with pride and vain glory.
Thus the Pharisee went up to the temple to boast of his religion, [Luk
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#011.md), [Luk
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#012). (2..md) He insists upon it as a
reason why God should gratify him in his desire to curse Israel, as if
now he had made God his debtor, and might draw upon him for what he
pleased. He thinks God is so much beholden to him for these sacrifices
that the least he can do in recompense for them is to sacrifice his
Israel to the malice of the king of Moab. Note, It is a common cheat
that wicked people put upon themselves, to think that by the shows of
piety they may prevail with God to countenance them, and connive at
them, in their greatest immoralities, especially in persecution, [Isa
66:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005.md). However, thought the sacrifice
was an abomination, God took the occasion of Balaam's expectation to put
a word into his mouth ([Num 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#005).md); for
the answer of the tongue if from the Lord, and thus he would show how
much those are mistaken who say, With our tongue we will prevail, our
lips are our own, [Psa 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#004.md). He that
made man's mouth knows how to manage it, and to serve his own purposes
by it. This speaks terror to daring sinners, that set their mouth
against the heavens. God can make their own tongues to fall upon them,
[Psa 64:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#008.md). And it speaks comfort to
God's witnesses, whom at any time he calls out to appear for him; if God
put a word into the mouth of Balaam, who would have defied God and
Israel, surely he will not be wanting to those who desire to glorify God
and edify his people by their testimony, but it shall be given them in
that same hour what they should speak.

2\. Balaam pronounces the blessing in the ears of Balak. He found him
standing by his burnt-sacrifice ([Num
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#006).md), closely attending it, and
earnestly expecting the success. those that wold have an answer of peace
from God must abide by the sacrifice, and attend on the Lord without
distraction, not weary in well doing. Balaam, having fixed himself in
the place appointed for his denouncing curses against Israel, which
perhaps he had drawn up in form ready to deliver, takes up his parable,
and it proves a blessing, [Num 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#007.md).
He pronounces Israel safe and happy, and so blesses them.

(1.) He pronounces them safe, and out of the reach of his envenomed
darts. \[1.\] He owns that the design was to curse them, that Balak sent
for him out of his own country, and that he came, with that intent, [Num
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#007.md). The message sent to him was,
Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel. Balak intended to make war
upon them, and he would have Balaam to bless his arms, and to prophesy
and pray for the ruin of Israel. \[2.\] He owns the design defeated, and
his own inability to accomplish it. He could not so much as give them an
ill word or an ill wish: How shall I curse those whom God has not
cursed? [Num 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#008.md). Not that therefore
he would not do it, but therefore he could not do it. this is a fair
confession, First, Of the weakness and impotency of his own magic skill,
for which others valued him so much, and doubtless he valued himself no
less. He was the most celebrated man of that profession, and yet owns
himself baffled. God had warned the Israelites not to use divination
([Lev 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031).md), and this providence gave
them a reason for that law, by showing them the weakness and folly of
it. As they had seen the magicians of Egypt befooled, so, here, the
great conjurer of the east. See [Isa
47:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#012.md). Secondly, It is a confession
of the sovereignty and dominion of the divine power. He owns that he
could do no more than God would suffer him to do, for God could overrule
all his purposes, and turn his counsels headlong. Thirdly, It is a
confession of the inviolable security of the people of God. Note, 1.
God's Israel are owned and blessed of him. He has not cursed them, for
they are delivered from the curse of the law; he has not defied them,
nor rejected or abandoned them, though mean and vile. 2. Those that have
the good-will of Heaven have the ill-will of hell; the serpent and this
seed have an enmity to them. 3. Though the enemies of God's people may
prevail far against them, yet they cannot curse them; that is, they
cannot do them any real mischief, much less a ruining mischief, for they
cannot separate them from the love of God, [Rom
8:39](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#039.md).

(2.) He pronounces them happy in three things: -

\[1.\] Happy in their peculiarity, and distinction from the rest of the
nations: From the top of the rock I see him, [Num
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#009.md). And it seems to have been a
great surprise to him that whereas, it is probable, they were
represented to him as a rude and disorderly rabble, that infested the
countries round about in rambling parties, he was them a regular
incorporated camp, in which appeared all the marks of discipline and
good order; he saw them a people dwelling alone, and foresaw they would
continue so, and their singularity would be their unspeakable honour.
Persons of quality we call person of distinction; this was Israel's
praise, though their enemies turned it to their reproach, that they
differed from all the neighbouring nations, not only in their religion
and sacred rites, but in their diet, and dress, and common usages, as a
people called out of the world, and not to be conformed to it. They
never lost their reputation till they mingled among the heathen, [Psa
106:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#035.md). Note, It is the duty and
honour of those that are dedicated to God to be separated from the
world, and not to walk according to the course and custom of it. Those
who make conscience of peculiar duties may take the comfort of peculiar
privileges, which it is probable Balaam has an eye to here. God's Israel
shall not stand upon a level with other nations, but be dignified above
them all, as a people near to God, and set apart for him.

\[2.\] Happy in their numbers, not so few and despicable as they were
represented to him, but an innumerable company, which made them both
honourable and formidable ([Num
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#010).md): Who can count the dust of
Jacob? The number of the people was the thing that Balak was vexed at
([Num 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#003).md): Moab was afraid of them,
because they were many; and God does here by Balaam promote that fear
and vexation, foretelling their further increase. Balak would have him
see the utmost part of the people ([Num
22:41](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#041).md), hoping the more he saw of them
the more he would be exasperated against them, and throw about his
curses with the more keenness and rage; but it proved quite contrary:
instead of being angry at their numbers, he admired them. The better
acquainted we are with God's people the better opinion we have of them.
He takes notice of the number, First, Of the dust of Jacob; that is, the
people of Jacob, concerning whom it was foretold that they should be as
the dust for number, [Gen 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#014.md). Thus
he owns the fulfilling of the promise made to the fathers, and expects
that it should be yet further accomplished. Perhaps it was part of
David's fault in numbering the people that he offered to count the dust
of Jacob, which God had said should be innumerable. Secondly, Of the
fourth part of Israel, alluding to the form of their camp, which was
cast into four squadrons, under four standards. Note, God's Israel are a
very great body, his spiritual Israel are so, and they will appear to be
so when they shall all be gathered together unto him in the great day,
[Rev 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md).

\[3.\] Happy in their end: Let me die the death of the righteous
Israelites, that are in covenant with God, and let my last end, or
future state, be like theirs, or my recompence, namely, in the other
world. Here, First, It is taken for granted that death is the end of all
men; the righteous themselves must die: and it is good for us to think
of this with application, as Balaam himself does here, speaking of his
own death. Secondly, he goes upon the supposition of the soul's
immortality, and a different state on the other side death, to which
this is a noble testimony, and an evidence of its being anciently known
and believed. For how could the death of the righteous be more desirable
than the death of the wicked upon any other account than as it involved
happiness in another world, since in the manner and circumstances of
dying we see all things come alike to all? Thirdly, He pronounces the
righteous truly blessed, not only while they live, but when they die,
which makes their death not only more desirable than the death of
others, but even more desirable than life itself; for in that sense his
wish may be taken. Not only, "When I do die, let me die the death of the
righteous;" but, "I could even now be willing to die, on condition that
I might die the death of the righteous, and reach my end this moment,
provided it might be like his." Very near the place where Balaam now
was, on one of the mountains of Moab, not long after this, Moses died,
and to that perhaps God, who put this word into his mouth, designed it
should have a reference, that by it Moses might be encouraged to go up
and die such a death as Balaam himself wished to die. Fourthly, He shows
his opinion of religion to be better than his resolution; there are many
who desire to die the death of the righteous, but do not endeavour to
live the life of the righteous. Gladly would they have their end like
theirs, but not their way. They would be saints in heaven, but not
saints on earth. This is the desire of the slothful, which kills him,
because his hands refuse to labour. This of Balaam's is only a wish, not
a prayer, and it is a vain wish, being only a wish for the end, without
any care for the means. Thus far this blessing goes, even to death, and
beyond it, as far as the last end. Now,

III\. We are told, 1. How Balak fretted at it, [Num
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#011.md). He pretended to honour the Lord
with his sacrifices, and to wait for the answer God would send him; and
yet, when it did not prove according to his mind, he forgot God, and
flew into a great passion against Balaam, as if it had been purely his
doing: "What hast thou done unto me! How hast thou disappointed me!"
Sometimes God makes the enemies of his church a vexation one to another,
while he that sits in heaven laughs at them, and the efforts of their
impotent malice. 2. How Balaam was forced to acquiesce in it. He submits
because he cannot help it, and yet humours the thing with no small
address, as if he had been peculiarly conscientious, answering Balak
with the gravity of a prophet: Must I not take heed to speak that which
the Lord has put in my mouth? [Num
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#012.md). Thus a confession of God's
overruling power is extorted from a wicked prophet, to the further
confusion of a wicked prince.

[Numbers 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 23:13</span></span>

Here is, I. Preparation made the second time, as before, for the cursing
of Israel. 1. The place is changed, [Num
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#013.md). Balak fancied that Balaam,
having so full a prospect of the whole camp of Israel, from the top of
the rocks ([Num 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#009).md), was either so
enamoured with the beauty of it that he would not curse them or so
affrighted with the terror of it that he durst not; and therefore he
would bring him to another place, form which he might see only some part
of them, which would appear more despicable, and that part at least
which would lie in view he hoped he might obtain leave to curse, and so
by degrees he should get ground against them, intending, no doubt, if he
had gained this point, to make his attack on that part of the camp of
Israel which Balaam now had in his eye, and into which he was to throw
the fireballs of his curses. See how restless and unwearied the church's
enemies are in their malicious attempts to ruin it; they leave no stone
unturned, no project untried, to compass it. O that we were as full of
contrivance and resolution in prosecuting good designs for the glory of
God! 2. The sacrifices are repeated, new altars are built, a bullock and
a ram offered on every altar, and Balak attends his sacrifice as closely
as ever, [Num 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#014.md), [Num
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#015.md). Were we thus earnest to obtain
the blessing as Balak was to procure a curse (designedly upon Israel,
but really upon himself and his people), we should not grudge the return
both of the charge and of the labour of religious exercises. 3. Balaam
renews his attendance on God, and God meets him the second time, and
puts another word into his mouth, not to reverse the former, but to
ratify it, [Num 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#016.md), [Num
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#017.md). If God said not to Balaam, Seek
in vain, much less will he say so to any of the seed of Jacob, who shall
surely find him, not only as Balaam, their instructor and oracle, but
their bountiful rewarder. When Balaam returned Balak was impatient to
know what message he had: "What hath the Lord spoken? Are there any
better tidings yet, any hopes of speeding?" This should be our enquiry
when we come to hear the word of God. See [Jer
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#035.md).

II\. A second conversion of the curse into a blessing by the overruling
power of God; and this blessing is both larger and stronger than the
former, and quite cuts off all hopes of altering it. Balak having been
so forward to ask what the Lord had spoken ([Num
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#017).md), Balaam now addresses himself
particularly to him ([Num 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#018).md): Rise
up, Balak, and hear. It was a message from God that he had to deliver,
and it is required of Balak, though a king, that he attend (hear and
hearken, with a close application of mind, let not a word slip), and
also that he attend with reverence: Rise up, and hear. His successor
Eglon, when he was to receive a message from God, rose out of his seat,
[Jdg 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#020.md).

1\. Two things Balaam in this discourse informs Balak of, sorely to his
grief and disappointment: -

(1.) That he had no reason to hope that he should ruin Israel.

\[1.\] It would be to no purpose to attempt to ruin them, and he would
deceive himself if he expected it, for three reasons: -

First, Because God is unchangeable: God is not a man that he should lie,
[Num 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019.md). Men change their minds,
and therefore break their words; they lie, because they repent. But God
does neither. He never changes his mind, and therefore never recalls his
promise. Balaam had owned ([Num 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#008).md)
that he could not alter God's counsel, and thence he infers here that
God himself would not alter it; such is the imperfection of man, and
such the perfection of God. It is impossible for God to lie, [Heb
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018.md). And, when in scripture he is
said to repent, it is not meant of any change of his mind (for he is in
one mind, and who can turn him?) but only of the change of his way. This
is a great truth, that with God there is no variableness nor shadow of
turning. Now here, 1. He appeals to Balak himself concerning it: "Hath
he said, and shall he not do it? Said it in his own purpose, and shall
he not perform it in his providence, according to the counsel of his
will? Hath he spoken in his word, in his promise, and shall he not make
it good? Can we think otherwise of God than that he is unchangeably one
with himself and true to his word? All his decrees are unalterable, and
all his promises inviolable." 2. He applies this general truth to the
case in hand ([Num 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#020).md): He hath
blessed and I cannot reverse it, that is, "I cannot prevail with him to
reverse it." Israel were of old a blessed people, a seed that the Lord
had blessed; the blessing of Abraham came upon them; they were born
under the blessing of the covenant, and born to the blessing of Canaan,
and therefore they could not be cursed, unless you could suppose that
the God of eternal truth should break his word, and become false to
himself and his people.

Secondly, Because Israel are at present unblamable: he has not beheld
iniquity in Jacob, [Num 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#021.md). Not but
that there was iniquity in Jacob, and God saw it; but, 1. There was not
such a degree of iniquity as might provoke God to abandon them and give
them up to ruin. As bad as they were, they were not so bad as this. 2.
There was no idolatry among them, which is in a particular manner called
iniquity and perverseness; we have found nothing of that kind in Israel
since the golden calf, and therefore, though they were in other
instances very provoking, yet God would not cast them off. Balaam knew
that nothing would separate between them and God but sin. While God saw
no reigning sin among them, he would send no destroying curse among
them; and therefore, as long as they kept in with God, he despaired of
ever doing them any mischief. Note, While we keep from sin we keep from
harm. Some give another sense of those words; they read it thus: He has
not beheld wrong offered to Jacob, nor will he see any grievance done to
Israel, that is, "He has not nor will he permit it, or allow it; he will
not see Israel injured, but he will right them, and avenge their
quarrel." Note, God will not bear to see any injury done to his church
and people; for what is done against them he takes as done against
himself, and will reckon for it accordingly.

Thirdly, Because the power of both was irresistible. He shows Balak that
there was no contending with them, it was to no purpose to attempt it;
for, 1. They had the presence of God with them: "The Lord his God is
with him in a particular manner, and not provoked to withdraw from him."
2. They had the joy of that presence, and were always made to triumph in
it: The shout or alarm of a king is among them. They shout against their
enemies, as sure of victory and success, glorying continually in God as
their King and conqueror for them. 3. They had had the experience of the
benefit of God's presence with them, and his power engaged for them; for
God brought them out of Egypt, [Num
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#022.md). The power which had done that
could never be restrained, never resisted; and, having begun so
gloriously, he would no doubt finish gloriously. 4. While they had God's
presence with them they had the strength of a unicorn, able to make head
against all that opposed them. See [Num
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#008.md). Such is the strength which the
God of Israel gives unto his people.

\[2.\] From all this he infers that it was to no purpose for him to
think of doing them a mischief by all the arts he could use, [Num
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#023.md). First, He owns himself baffled.
Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob so as to prevail. The
curses of hell can never take place against the blessings of heaven. Not
but that attempts of this kind would be made, but they would certainly
be fruitless and ineffectual. Some observe that Jacob denotes the church
low and afflicted, Israel denotes it prosperous and advanced; but be the
church high or low, be her friends few or many, let second causes smile
or frown, it comes all to one: no weapon formed against it shall
prosper. Note, God easily can, and certainly will, baffle and disappoint
all the devices and designs of the powers of darkness against his
church, so that they shall not prevail to destroy it. Secondly, He
foresees that this would be remembered in time to come. According to
this time, that is, with reference to this we are now about, it shall be
said concerning Jacob and Israel, and said by them, What hath God
wrought! What great things hath God done for his people! It shall be
said with wonder, joy, and thankfulness, and a challenge to the
neighbouring nations to produce any similar instances of the care of
their gods for them. Note, The defeating of the designs of the church's
enemies ought to be had in everlasting remembrance to the glory of God.
There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun. What Balaam says here
concerning the pre-eminence of the God of Israel above all the gods of
the Gentiles perhaps Moses refers to when he says ([Deu
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#031).md), Their rock is not as our rock,
even our enemies themselves being judges, Balaam particularly. Balak
therefore has no hopes of ruining Israel. But,

(2.) Balaam shows him that he had more reason to fear being ruined by
them, for they were likely to make bloody work among his neighbours;
and, if he and his country escaped, it was not because he was too great
for them to meddle with, but because he fell not within their commission
[Num 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#024.md). Behold, and tremble; the
people that now have lain for some time closely encamped do but repose
themselves for a while like a lion couchant, but shortly they shall rise
up as a great lion, a lion rampant, that shall not lie down till he eat
of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain. This seems to point at
the victories he foresaw they would obtain over the Canaanites, that
they would never lay down their arms till they had made a complete
conquest of the land they had now in view; and, when his neighbour's
house was on fire, he had reason to think his own in danger.

2\. Now what was the issue of this disappointment?

(1.) Balak and Balaam were both of them sick of the cause. \[1.\] Balak
is now willing to have his conjurer silenced. Since he cannot say what
he would have him, he wishes him to say nothing: "Neither curse them at
all nor bless them at all, [Num 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#025.md).
If thous canst not curse them, I beseech thee not to bless them. If thou
canst no assist and encourage my forces, yet do not oppose and dispirit
them" Note, God can make those that depart from him weary of the
multitude of their counsels, [Isa
47:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#013.md); [Isa
57:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#010.md). \[2.\] Balaam is still willing
to own himself overruled, and appeals to what he had said in the
beginning of this enterprise ([Num
22:38](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#038).md): All that the Lord speaketh,
that I must do, [Num 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#026.md). This sows,
First, In general, that the way of man is not in himself; there are many
devices in man's heart, but God's counsels shall stand. Secondly, In
particular, that, as no weapon formed against the church shall prosper,
so every tongue that rises against her in judgment god will control and
condemn, [Isa 54:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#017.md).

(2.) Yet they resolve to make another attempt. They think it scorn to be
baffled, and therefore pursue the design, though it be only to their
further confusion. And now the third time, \[1.\] They change the place.
Balak is at last convinced that it is not Balaam's fault, on whom,
before, he had laid the blame, but that really he was under a divine
check, and therefore now he hopes to bring him to a place whence God
might at least permit him to curse them, v. 27. Probably he and Balaam
were the more encouraged thus to repeat their attempt because God had
the second time allowed Balaam to go, though he had forbidden him the
first time. Since by repeated trials they had carried that point, they
hope in like manner to carry this. Thus because sinners are borne with,
and sentence against their evil works is not executed speedily, their
hearts are the more fully set in them to do evil. The place to which
Balak now took Balaam was the top of Peor, the most eminent high place
in all his country, where, it is probable, Baal was worshipped, and it
was thence called Baal-peor. He chose this place with a hope, either,
First, That it being the residence (as he fancied) of Baal, the god of
Moab, Jehovah the God of Israel would not, or could not, come hither to
hinder the operation; or, Secondly, That, it being a place acceptable to
his god, it would be so to the Lord, and there he would be brought into
a good humour. Such idle conceits have foolish men of God, and so vain
are their imaginations concerning him. Thus the Syrians fancied the Lord
to be God of the hills, but not of the valleys ([Kg1
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#028).md), as if he were more powerful in
one place than he is in every place. \[2.\] They repeat their sacrifice,
seven bullocks and seven rams, upon seven altars, v. 29, 30. Thus do
they persevere in their expensive oblations, though they had no promise
on which to build their hopes of speeding. Let not us therefore, who
have a promise that the vision at the end shall speak and not lie, be
discouraged by delays, but continue instant in prayer, and not faint,
[Luk 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#001.md).
