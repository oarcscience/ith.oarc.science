### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 2:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have, I. Hannah's song of thanksgiving to God for his
favour to her in giving her Samuel ([Sa1
2:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#001).md). II. Their return to their
family, with Eli's blessing ([Sa1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#011.md), [Sa1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#020).md). The increase of their family
([Sa1 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#021).md). Samuel's growth and
improvement ([Sa1 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#011.md), [Sa1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#018.md), [Sa1
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#021.md), [Sa1
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#026).md), and the care Hannah took to
clothe him ([Sa1 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#019).md). III. The great
wickedness of Eli's sons ([Sa1
2:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#012.md), [Sa1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#022).md). IV. The over-mild reproof that
Eli gave them for it ([Sa1 2:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#023).md).
V. The justly dreadful message God sent him by a prophet, threatening
the ruin of his family for the wickedness of his sons ([Sa1
2:27-36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#027).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 2:1</span></span>

We have here Hannah's thanksgiving, dictated, not only by the spirit of
prayer, but by the spirit of prophecy. Her petition for the mercy she
desired we had before ([Sa1 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#011).md), and
here we have her return of praise; in both out of the abundance of a
heart deeply affected (in the former with her own wants, and in the
latter with God's goodness) her mouth spoke. Observe in general, 1. When
she had received mercy from God she owned it, with thankfulness to his
praise. Not like the nine lepers, [Luk
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#017.md). Praise is our rent, our
tribute. We are unjust if we do not pay it. 2. The mercy she had
received was an answer to prayer, and therefore she thought herself
especially obliged to give thanks for it. What we win by prayer we may
wear with comfort, and must wear with praise. 3. Her thanksgiving is
here called a prayer: Hannah prayed; for thanksgiving is an essential
part of prayer. In every address to God we must express a grateful
regard to him as our benefactor. Nay, and thanksgiving for mercies
received shall be accepted as a petition for further mercy. 4. From this
particular mercy which she had received from God she takes occasion,
with an elevated and enlarged heart, to speak glorious things of God and
of his government of the world for the good of his church. Whatever at
any time gives rise to our praises in this manner they should be raised.
5. Her prayer was mental. Her voice was not heard; but in her
thanksgiving she spoke, that all might hear her. She made her
supplication with groanings that could not be uttered, but now her lips
were opened to show forth God's praise. 6. This thanksgiving is here
left upon record for the encouragement of those of the weaker sex to
attend the throne of grace. God will regard their prayers and praises.
The virgin Mary's song has great affinity with this of Hannah, [Luk
1:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#046.md). Three things we have in this
thanksgiving: -

I. Hannah's triumph in God, in his glorious perfections, and the great
things he had done for her, [Sa1
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#001.md). Observe,

1\. What great things she says of God. She takes little notice of the
particular mercy she was now rejoicing in, does not commend Samuel for
the prettiest child, the most toward and sensible for his age that she
ever saw, as fond parents are too apt to do. No, she overlooks the gift,
and praises the giver; whereas most forget the giver and fasten only on
the gift. Every stream should lead us to the fountain; and the favours
we receive from God should raise our admiration of the infinite
perfections there are in God. There may be other Samuels, but no other
Jehovah. There is none beside thee. Note, God is to be praised as a
peerless being, and of unparalleled perfection. This glory is due unto
his name, to own not only that there is none like him, but that there is
none besides him. All others were pretenders, [Psa
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#031.md). Four of God's glorious
attributes Hannah here celebrates the glory of: - (1.) His unspotted
purity. This is that attribute which is most praised in the upper world,
by those that always behold his face, [Isa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003.md); [Rev
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#008.md). When Israel triumphed over the
Egyptians God was praised as glorious in holiness, [Exo
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011.md). So here, in Hannah's triumph,
There is none holy as the Lord. It is the rectitude of his nature, his
infinite agreement with himself, and the equity of his government and
judgment in all the administrations of both. At the remembrance of this
we ought to give thanks. (2.) His almighty power: Neither is there any
rock (or any strength, for so the word is sometimes rendered) like our
God. Hannah had experienced a mighty support by staying herself upon
him, and therefore speaks as she had found, and seems to refer to that
of Moses, [Deu 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#031). (3..md) His
unsearchable wisdom: The Lord, the Judge of all, is a God of knowledge;
he clearly and perfectly sees into the character of every person and the
merits of every cause, and he gives knowledge and understanding to those
that seek them of him. (4.) His unerring justice: By him actions are
weighed. His own are so, in his eternal counsels; the actions of the
children of men are so, in the balances of his judgment, so that he will
render to every man according to his work, and is not mistaken in what
any man is or does.

2\. How she solaces herself in these things. What we give God the glory
of we may take the comfort of. Hannah does so, (1.) In holy joy: My
heart rejoiceth in the Lord; not so much in her son as in her God; he is
to be the gladness of our joy ([Psa
43:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#004).md), and our joy must not terminate
in any thing short of him: "I rejoice in thy salvation; not only in this
particular favour to me, but in the salvation of thy people Israel,
those salvations especially which this child will be an instrument of,
and that, above all, by Christ, which those are but the types of." (2.)
In holy triumph: "My horn is exalted; not only is my reputation saved by
my having a son, but greatly raised by having such a son." We read of
some of the singers whom David appointed to lift up the horn, an
instrument of music, in praising God ([Ch1
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#005).md), so that, My horn is exalted
means this, "My praises are very much elevated to an unusual strain."
Exalted in the Lord; God is to have the honour of all our exaltations,
and in him must we triumph. My mouth is enlarged, that is, "Now I have
wherewith to answer those that reproached me." He that has his quiver
full of arrows, his house full of children, shall not be ashamed to
speak with the enemy in the gate, [Psa
127:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#005.md).

3\. How she herewith silences those that set up themselves as rivals
with God and rebels against him ([Sa1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#003).md): Talk no more so exceedingly
proudly. Let not Peninnah and her children upbraid her any more with her
confidence in God and praying to him: at length she found it not in
vain. See [Mic 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#010.md), Then she that is
my enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her that said, Where is thy
God? Or perhaps it was below her to take so much notice of Peninnah, and
her malice, in this song; but this is intended as a check to the
insolence of the Philistines, and other enemies of God and Israel, that
set their mouth against the heavens, [Psa
73:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#009.md). "Let this put them to silence
and shame; he that has thus judged for me against my adversary will
judge for his people against all theirs."

II\. The notice she takes of the wisdom and sovereignty of the divine
providence, in its disposals of the affairs of the children of men; such
are the vicissitudes of them, and such the strange and sudden turns and
revolutions of them, that it is often found a very short step between
the height of prosperity and the depth of adversity. God has not only
set the one over against the other ([Ecc
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#014).md), but the one very near the
other, and no gulf fixed between them, that we may rejoice as though we
rejoiced not and weep as though we wept not.

1\. The strong are soon weakened and the weak are soon strengthened,
when God pleases, [Sa1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#004.md). On the one
hand, if he speak the word, the bows of the mighty men are broken; they
are disarmed, disabled to do as they have before done and as they have
designed to do. Those have been worsted in battle who seemed upon all
accounts to have the advantage on their side, and thought themselves
sure of victory. See [Psa 46:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#009.md); [Psa
37:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#015.md), [Psa
37:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#017.md). Particular persons are soon
weakened by sickness and age, and they find that the bow does not long
abide in strength; many a mighty man who has gloried in his might has
found it a deceitful bow, that failed him when he trusted to it. On the
other hand, if the Lord speak the word, those who stumble through
weakness, who were so feeble that they could not go straight or steady,
are girded with strength, in body and mind, and are able to bring great
things to pass. Those who were weakened by sickness return to their
vigour ([Job 33:25](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#025).md), and those who
were brought down by sorrow shall recover their comfort, which will
confirm the weak hands and the feeble knees, [Isa
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#003.md). Victory turns in favour of that
side that was given up for gone, and even the lame take the prey, [Isa
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#023.md).

2\. The rich are soon impoverished and the poor strangely enriched on a
sudden, [Sa1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#005.md). Providence sometimes
does so blast men's estates and cross their endeavours, and with a fire
not blown consume their increase, that those who were full (their barns
full, and their bags full, their houses full of good things, [Job
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#018.md), and their bellies full of these
hidden treasures, [Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014).md) have
been reduced to such straits and extremities as to want the necessary
supports of life, and to hire out themselves for bread, and they must
dig, since to beg they are ashamed. Riches flee away ([Pro
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#005).md), and leave those miserable who,
when they had them, placed their happiness in them. To those that have
been full and free poverty must needs be doubly grievous. But, on the
other hand, sometimes Providence so orders it that those who are hungry
cease, that is, cease to hire out themselves for bread as they have
done. Having, by God's blessing on their industry, got beforehand in the
world, and enough to live upon at ease, they shall hunger no more, not
thirst any more. This is not to be ascribed to fortune, nor merely to
men's wisdom or folly. Riches are not to men of understanding, nor
favour to men of skill ([Ecc 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#011).md),
nor is it always men's own fault that they become poor, but ([Sa1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#007).md) the Lord maketh some poor and
maketh others rich; the impoverishing of one is the enriching of
another, and it is God's doing. To some he gives power to get wealth,
from others he takes away power to keep the wealth they have. Are we
poor? God made us poor, which is a good reason why we should be content,
and reconcile ourselves to our condition. Are we rich? God made us rich,
which is a good reason why we should be thankful, and serve him
cheerfully in the abundance of good things he gives us. It may be
understood of the same person; those that were rich God makes poor, and
after awhile makes rich again, as Job; he gave, he takes away, and then
gives again. Let not the rich be proud and secure, for God can soon make
them poor; let not the poor despond and despair, for God can in due time
enrich them again.

3\. Empty families are replenished and numerous families diminished and
made few. This is the instance that comes close to the occasion of the
thanksgiving: The barren hath borne seven, meaning herself, for, though
at present she had but one son, yet that one being a Nazarite, devoted
to God and employed in his immediate service, he was to her as good as
seven. Or it is the language of her faith. Now that she had one she
hoped for more, and was not disappointed; she had five more ([Sa1
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#021).md), so that if we reckon Samuel but
for two, as we well may, she has the number she promised herself: the
barren hath borne seven, while, on the other hand, she that hath many
children has waxed feeble, and hath left bearing. She says no more.
Peninnah is now mortified and crest-fallen. The tradition of the Jews is
that when Hannah bore one child Peninnah buried two. There are many
instances both of the increase of families that were inconsiderable and
the extinguishing of families that made a figure, [Job
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#023.md); [Psa
107:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#038.md), etc.

4\. God is the sovereign Lord of life and death ([Sa1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#006).md): The Lord killeth and maketh
alive. Understand it, (1.) Of God's sovereign dominion and universal
agency, in the lives and deaths of the children of men. He presides in
births and burials. Whenever any die it is God that directs the arrows
of death. The Lord killeth. Death is his messenger, strikes whom and
when he bids; none are brought to the dust but it is he that brings them
down, for in his hand are the keys of death and the grave, [Rev
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#018.md). Whenever any are born it is he
that makes them alive. None knows what is the way of the spirit, but
this we know, that it comes from the Father of spirits. Whenever any are
recovered from sickness, and delivered from imminent perils, it is God
that bringeth up; for to him belong the issues from death. (2.) Of the
distinction he makes between some and others: He killeth some, and
maketh, that is, keepeth, others alive that were in the same danger (in
war, suppose, or pestilence), two in a bed together, it may be, one
taken by death and the other left alive. Even so, Father, because it
seemed good in thy eyes. Some that were most likely to live are brought
down to the grave, and others that were as likely to die are brought up;
for living and dying do not go by likelihoods. God's providences towards
some are killing, ruining to their comforts, and towards others at the
same time reviving. (3.) Of the change he makes with one and the same
person: He killeth and bringeth down to the grave, that is, he brings
even to death's door, and then revives and raises up, when even life was
despaired of and a sentence of death received, [Co2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#008.md), [Co2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#009.md). He turns to destruction, and then
says, Return, [Psa 110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md). Nothing is
too hard for God to do, no, not the quickening of the dead, and putting
life into dry bones.

5\. Advancement and abasement are both from him. He brings some low and
lifts up others ([Sa1 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#007).md), humbles
the proud and gives grace and honour to the lowly, lays those in the
dust that would vie with the God above them and trample upon all about
them ([Job 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#012.md), [Job
40:13](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#013).md), but lifts up those with his
salvation that humble themselves before him, [Jam
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#010.md). Or it may be understood of the
same persons: those whom he had brought low, when they are sufficiently
humbled, he lifteth up. This is enlarged upon, [Sa1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#008.md). He raiseth up the poor out of the
dust, a low and mean condition, nay, from the dunghill, a base and
servile condition, loathed, and despised, to set them among princes. See
[Psa 113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007.md), [Psa
113:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#008.md). Promotion comes not by chance,
but from the counsel of God, which often prefers those that were very
unlikely and that men thought very unworthy. Joseph and Daniel, Moses
and David, were thus strangely advanced, from a prison to a palace, from
a sheep-hook to a sceptre. The princes they are set among may be tempted
to disdain them, but God can establish the honour which he gives thus
surprisingly, and make them even to inherit the throne of glory. Let not
those whom Providence has thus preferred be upbraided with the dust and
dunghill they are raised out of, for the meaner their beginnings were
the more they are favoured, and God is glorified, in their advancement,
if it be by lawful and honourable means.

6\. A reason is given for all these dispensations which obliges us to
acquiesce in them, how surprising soever they are: For the pillars of
the earth are the Lord's. (1.) If we understand this literally, it
intimates God's almighty power, which cannot be controlled. He upholds
the whole creation, founded the earth, and still sustains it by the word
of his power. What cannot he do in the affairs of families and kingdoms,
far beyond our conception and expectation, who hangs the earth upon
nothing? [Job 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#007). But, (2..md) If we
understand it figuratively, it intimates his incontestable sovereignty,
which cannot be disputed. The princes and great ones of the earth, the
directors of states and governments, are the pillars of the earth, [Psa
75:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#003.md). On these hinges the affairs of
the world seem to turn, but they are the Lord's, [Psa
47:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009.md). From him they have their power,
and therefore he may advance whom he pleases; and who may say, What
doest thou?

III\. A prediction of the preservation and advancement of all God's
faithful friends, and the destruction of all his and their enemies.
Having testified her joyful triumph in what God had done, and is doing,
she concludes with joyful hopes of what he would do, [Sa1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#009.md), [Sa1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010.md). Pious affections (says bishop
Patrick) in those days rose many times to the height of prophecy,
whereby God continued in that nation his true religion, in the midst of
their idolatrous inclinations. This prophecy may refer, 1. More
immediately to the government of Israel by Samuel, and by David whom he
was employed to anoint. The Israelites, God's saints, should be
protected and delivered; the Philistines, their enemies, should be
conquered and subdued, and particularly by thunder, [Sa1
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#010.md). Their dominions should be
enlarged, king David strengthened and greatly exalted, and Israel (that
in the time of the judges had made so small a figure and had much ado to
subsist) should now shortly become great and considerable, and give law
to all its neighbours. An extraordinary change that was; and the birth
of Samuel was, as it were, the dawning of that day. But, 2. We have
reason to think that this prophecy looks further, to the kingdom of
Christ, and the administration of that kingdom of grace, of which she
now comes to speak, having spoken so largely of the kingdom of
providence. And here is the first time that we meet with the name
Messiah, or his Anointed. The ancient expositors, both Jewish and
Christian, make it to look beyond David, to the Son of David. Glorious
things are here spoken of the kingdom of the Mediator, both before and
since his incarnation; for the method of the administration of it, both
by the eternal Word and by that Word made flesh, is much the same.
Concerning that kingdom we are here assured, (1.) That all the loyal
subjects of it shall be carefully and powerfully protected ([Sa1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#009).md): He will keep the feet of his
saints. There are a people in the world that are God's saints, his
select and sanctified ones; and he will keep their feet, that is, all
that belongs to them shall be under his protection, down to their very
feet, the lowest part of the body. If he will keep their feet, much more
their head and hearts. Or he will keep their feet, that is, he will
secure the ground they stand on, and establish their goings; he will set
a guard of grace upon their affections and actions, that their feet may
neither wander out of the way nor stumble in the way. When their feet
are ready to slip ([Psa 73:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#002).md) his
mercy holdeth them up ([Psa 94:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#018).md) and
keepeth them from falling, [Jde 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#024.md).
While we keep God's ways he will keep our feet. See [Psa
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#023.md), [Psa
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#024). (2..md) That all the powers
engaged against it shall not be able to effect the ruin of it. By
strength shall no man prevail. God's strength is engaged for the church;
and, while it is so, man's strength shall not prevail against it. The
church seems destitute of strength, her friends few and feeble, but
prevalency does not go by human strength, [Psa
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#016.md). God neither needs it for him
([Psa 147:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#010).md) nor dreads it against
him. (3.) That all the enemies of it will certainly be broken and
brought down: The wicked shall be silent in darkness, [Sa1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#009.md). They shall be struck both blind
and dumb, not be able to see their way nor have any thing to say for
themselves. Damned sinners are sentenced to utter darkness, and in it
they will be for ever speechless, [Mat
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#012.md), [Mat
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#013.md). The wicked are called the
adversaries of the Lord, and it is foretold ([Mat
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#010).md) that they shall be broken to
pieces. Their designs against his kingdom among men will all be dashed,
and they themselves destroyed; how can those speed better that are in
arms against Omnipotence? See [Luk
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#027.md). God has many ways of doing it,
and, rather than fail, from heaven shall he thunder upon them, and so,
not only put them in terror and consternation, but bring them to
destruction. Who can stand before God's thunderbolts? (4.) That the
conquests of this kingdom shall extend themselves to distant regions:
The Lord shall judge the ends of the earth. David's victories and
dominions reached far, but the uttermost parts of the earth are promised
to the Messiah for his possession ([Psa
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008).md), to be either reduced to his
golden sceptre or ruined by his iron rod. God is Judge of all, and he
will judge for his people against his and their enemies, [Psa
110:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#005.md), [Psa
110:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#006). (5..md) That the power and honour
of Messiah the prince shall grow and increase more and more: He shall
give strength unto his king, for the accomplishing of his great
undertaking ([Psa 89:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#021.md), and see [Luk
22:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#043).md), strengthen him to go through
the difficulties of his humiliation, and in his exaltation he will lift
up the head ([Psa 110:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#007).md), lift up the
horn, the power and honour, of his anointed, and make him higher than
the kings of the earth, [Psa 89:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#027.md).
This crowns the triumph, and is, more than any thing, the matter of her
exultation. Her horn is exalted ([Sa1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#001).md) because she foresees the horn of
the Messiah will be so. This secures the hope. The subjects of Christ's
kingdom will be safe, and the enemies of it will be ruined, for the
anointed, the Lord Christ, is girded with strength, and is able to save
and destroy unto the uttermost.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 2:11</span></span>

In these verses we have the good character and posture of Elkanah's
family, and the bad character and posture of Eli's family. The account
of these two is observably interwoven throughout this whole paragraph,
as if the historian intended to set the one over against the other, that
they might set off one another. The devotion and good order of Elkanah's
family aggravated the iniquity of Eli's house; while the wickedness of
Eli's sons made Samuel's early piety appear the more bright and
illustrious.

I. Let us see how well things went in Elkanah's family and how much
better than formerly. 1. Eli dismissed them from the house of the Lord,
when they had entered their little son there, with a blessing, [Sa1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#020.md). He blessed as one having
authority: The Lord give thee more children of this woman, for the loan
that is lent to the Lord. If Hannah had then had many children, it would
not have been such a generous piece of piety to part with one out of
many for the service of the tabernacle; but when she had but one, an
only one whom she loved, her Isaac, to present him to the Lord was such
an act of heroic piety as should by no means lose its reward. As when
Abraham had offered Isaac he received the promise of a numerous issue
([Gen 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016.md), [Gen
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017).md), so did Hannah, when she had
presented Samuel unto the Lord a living sacrifice. Note, What is lent to
the Lord will certainly be repaid with interest, to our unspeakable
advantage, and oftentimes in kind. Hannah resigns one child to God, and
is recompensed with five; for Eli's blessing took effect ([Sa1
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#021).md): She bore three sons and two
daughters. There is nothing lost by lending to God or losing for him; it
shall be repaid a hundred-fold, [Mat
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#029.md). 2. They returned to their own
habitation. This is twice mentioned, [Sa1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#011.md), and again [Sa1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#020.md). It was very pleasant to attend
at God's house, to bless him, and to be blessed of him. But they have a
family at home that must be looked after, and thither they return,
cheerfully leaving the dear little one behind them, knowing they left
him in a good place; and it does not appear that he cried after them,
but was as willing to stay as they were to leave him, so soon did he put
away childish things and behave like a man. 3. They kept up their
constant attendance at the house of God with their yearly sacrifice,
[Sa1 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#019.md). They did not think that
their son's ministering there would excuse them, or that that offering
must serve instead of other offerings; but, having found the benefit of
drawing near to God, they would omit no appointed season for it, and now
they had one loadstone more in Shiloh to draw them thither. We may
suppose they went thither to see their child oftener than once a year,
for it was not ten miles from Ramah; but their annual visit is taken
notice of because then they brought their yearly sacrifice, and then
Hannah fitted up her son (and some think oftener than once a year) with
a new suit of clothes, a little coat ([Sa1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#019).md) and every thing belonging to it.
She undertook to find him with clothes during his apprenticeship at the
tabernacle, and took care he should be well provided, that he might
appear the more decent and sightly in his ministration, and to encourage
him in his towardly beginnings. Parents must take care that their
children want nothing that is fit for them, whether they are with them
or from them; but those that are dutiful and hopeful, and minister to
the Lord, must be thought worthy of double care and kindness. 4. The
child Samuel did very well. Four separate times he is mentioned in these
verses, and two things we are told of: - (1.) The service he did to the
Lord. He did well indeed, for he ministered to the Lord ([Sa1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#011.md), [Sa1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#018).md) according as his capacity was.
He learned his catechism and was constant to his devotions, soon learned
to read, and took a pleasure in the book of the law, and thus he
ministered to the Lord. He ministered before Eli, that is, under his
inspection, and as he ordered him, not before Eli's sons; all parties
were agreed that they were unfit to be his tutors. Perhaps he attended
immediately on Eli's person, was ready to him to fetch and bring as he
had occasion, and that is called ministering to the Lord. Some little
services perhaps he was employed in about the altar, though much under
the age appointed by the law for the Levites' ministration. He could
light a candle, or hold a dish, or run on an errand, or shut a door;
and, because he did this with a pious disposition of mind it is called
ministering to the Lord, and great notice is taken of it. After awhile
he did his work so well that Eli appointed that he should minister with
a linen ephod as the priests did (though he was no priest), because he
saw that God was with him. Note, Little children must learn betimes to
minister to the Lord. Parents must train them up to it, and God will
accept them. Particularly let them learn to pay respect to their
teachers, as Samuel to Eli. None can begin too soon to be religious. See
[Psa 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#002.md), and [Mat
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#015.md), [Mat
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#016). (2..md) The blessing he received
from the Lord: He grew before the Lord, as a tender plant ([Sa1
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#021).md), grew on ([Sa1
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#026).md) in strength and stature, and
especially in wisdom and understanding and fitness for business. Note,
Those young people that serve God as well as they can will obtain grace
to improve, that they may serve him better. Those that are planted in
God's house shall flourish, [Psa
92:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#013.md). He was in favour with the Lord
and with man. Note, It is a great encouragement to children to be
tractable, and virtuous, and good betimes, that if they be both God and
man will love them. Such children are the darlings both of heaven and
earth. What is here said of Samuel is said of our blessed Saviour, that
great example, [Luk 2:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#052.md).

II\. Let us now see how ill things went in Eli's family, though seated
at the very door of the tabernacle. The nearer the church the further
from God.

1\. The abominable wickedness of Eli's sons ([Sa1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#012).md): The sons of Eli were sons of
Belial. It is emphatically expressed. Nothing appears to the contrary
but that Eli himself was a very good man, and no doubt had educated his
sons well, giving them good instructions, setting them good examples,
and putting up many a good prayer for them; and yet, when they grew up,
they proved sons of Belial, profane wicked men, and arrant rakes: They
knew not the Lord. They could not but have a notional knowledge of God
and his law, a form of knowledge ([Rom
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#020).md), yet, because their practice was
not conformable to it, they are spoken of as wholly ignorant of God;
they lived as if they knew nothing at all of God. Note, Parents cannot
give grace to their children, nor does it run in the blood. Many that
are sincerely pious themselves live to see those that come from them
notoriously impious and profane; for the race is not to the swift. Eli
was high priest and judge in Israel. His sons were priests by their
birth. Their character was sacred and honourable, and obliged them, for
their reputation-sake, to observe decorum. They were resident at the
fountain-head both of magistracy and ministry, and yet they were sons of
Belial, and their honour, power, and learning, made them so much the
worse. They did not go to serve other gods, as those did that lived at a
distance from the altar, for from the house of God they had their wealth
and dignity; but, which was worse, they managed the service of God as if
he had been one of the dunghill deities of the heathen. It is hard to
say which dishonours God more, idolatry or profaneness, especially the
profaneness of the priests. Let us see the wickedness of Eli's sons; and
it is a sad sight.

(1.) They profaned the offerings of the Lord, and made a gain to
themselves, or rather a gratification of their own luxury, out of them.
God had provided competently for them out of the sacrifices. The
offerings of the Lord made by fire were a considerable branch of their
revenue, but not enough to please them; they served not the God of
Israel, but their own bellies ([Rom
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#018).md), being such as the prophet
calls greedy dogs that can never have enough, [Isa
56:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#011.md). \[1.\] They robbed the
offerers, and seized for themselves some of their part of the sacrifice
of the peace-offerings. The priests had for their share the wave-breast
and the heave shoulder ([Lev 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#034).md),
but these did not content them; when the flesh was boiling for the
offerer to feast upon religiously with his friends, they sent a servant
with a flesh-hook of three teeth, a trident, and that must be stuck into
the pot, and whatever that brought up the priest must have ([Sa1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#013.md), [Sa1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#014).md), and the people, out of their
great veneration, suffered this to grow into a custom, so that after
awhile prescription was pleaded for this manifest wrong. \[2.\] They
stepped in before God himself, and encroached upon his right too. As if
it were a small thing to weary men, they wearied my God also, [Isa
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#013.md). Be it observed, to the honour of
Israel, that though the people tamely yielded to their unwarrantable
demands from them, yet they were very solicitous that God should not be
robbed: Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, [Sa1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#016.md). Let the altar have its due, for
that is the main matter. Unless God have the fat, they can feast with
little comfort upon the flesh. It was a shame that the priests should
need to be thus admonished by the people of their duty; but they
regarded not the admonition. The priest will be served first, and will
take what he thinks fit of the fat too, for he is weary of boiled meat,
he must have roast, and, in order to that, they must give it to him raw;
and if the offerer dispute it, though not in his own favour (let the
priest take what he pleases of his part) but in favour of the altar (let
them be sure to burn the fat first), even the priest's servant had grown
so very imperious that he would either have it now or take it by force,
than which there could not be a greater affront to God nor a greater
abuse to the people. The effect was, First, That God was displeased: The
sin of the young men was very great before the Lord, [Sa1
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#017.md). Nothing is more provoking to God
than the profanation of sacred things, and men serving their lusts with
the offerings of the Lord. Secondly, That religion suffered by it: Men
abhorred the offerings of the Lord. All good men abhorred their
management of the offerings, and too many insensibly fell into a
contempt of the offerings themselves for their sakes. It was the
people's sin to think the worse of God's institutions, but it was the
much greater sin of the priests that gave them occasion to do so.
Nothing brings a greater reproach upon religion than ministers'
covetousness, sensuality, and imperiousness. In the midst of this sad
story comes in the repeated mention of Samuel's devotion. But Samuel
ministered before the Lord, as an instance of the power of God's grace,
in preserving him pure and pious in the midst of this wicked crew; and
this helped to keep up the sinking credit of the sanctuary in the minds
of the people, who, when they had said all they could against Eli's
sons, could not but admire Samuel's seriousness, and speak well of
religion for his sake.

(2.) They debauched the women that came to worship at the door of the
tabernacle, [Sa1 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#022.md). They had wives
of their own, but were like fed horses, [Jer
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#008.md). To have gone to the harlots'
houses, the common prostitutes, would have been abominable wickedness,
but to use the interest which as priests they had in those women that
had devout dispositions and were religiously inclined, and to bring them
to commit their wickedness, was such horrid impiety as one can scarcely
think it possible that men who called themselves priests should ever be
guilty of. Be astonished, O heavens! at this, and tremble, O earth! No
words can sufficiently express the villany of such practices as these.

2\. The reproof which Eli gave his sons for this their wickedness: Eli
was very old ([Sa1 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#022).md) and could not
himself inspect the service of the tabernacle as he had done, but left
all to his sons, who, because of the infirmities of his age, slighted
him, and did what they would. However, he was told of the wickedness of
his sons, and we may well imagine what a heart-breaking it was to him,
and how much it added to the burdens of his age; but it should seem he
did not so much as reprove them till he heard of their debauching the
women, and then he thought fit to give them a check. Had he rebuked them
for their greediness and luxury, this might have been prevented. Young
people should be told of their faults as soon as it is perceived that
they begin to be extravagant, lest their hearts be hardened. Now
concerning the reproof he gave them observe,

(1.) That it was very just and rational. That which he said was very
proper. \[1.\] He tells them that the matter of fact was too plain to be
denied and too public to be concealed: "I hear of your evil dealings by
all this people, [Sa1 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#023.md). It is not
the surmise of one or two, but the avowed testimony of many; all your
neighbours cry out shame on you, and bring their complaints to me,
expecting that I should redress the grievance." \[2.\] He shows them the
bad consequences of it, that they not only sinned, but made Israel to
sin, and would have the people's sin to answer for as well as their own:
"You that should turn men from iniquity ([Mal
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#006).md), you make the Lord's people to
transgress, and corrupt the nation instead of reforming it; you tempt
people to go and serve other gods when they see the God of Israel so ill
served." \[3.\] He warns them of the danger they brought themselves into
by it, [Sa1 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#025.md). He intimates to them
what God afterwards told him, that the iniquity would not be purged with
sacrifice nor offering, [Sa1 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#014.md). If
one man sin against another, the judge (that is, the priest, who was
appointed to be the judge in many cases, [Deu
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#009).md) shall judge him, shall undertake
his cause, arbitrate the matter, and make atonement for the offender;
but if a man sin against the Lord (that is, if a priest profane the holy
things of the Lord, if a man that deals with God for others do himself
affront him) who shall entreat for him? Eli was himself a judge, and had
often made intercession for transgressors, but, says he, "You that sin
against the Lord," that is, "against the law and honour of God, in those
very things which immediately pertain to him, and by which
reconciliation is to be made, how can I entreat for you?" Their
condition was deplorable indeed when their own father could not speak a
good word for them, nor could have the face to appear as their advocate.
Sins against the remedy, the atonement itself, are most dangerous,
treading under foot the blood of the covenant, for then there remains no
more sacrifice, [Heb 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026.md).

(2.) It was too mild and gentle. He should have rebuked them sharply.
Their crimes deserved sharpness; their temper needed it; the softness of
his dealing with them would but harden them the more. The animad-version
was too easy when he said, It is no good report. he should have said,
"It is a shameful scandalous thing, and not to be suffered!" Whether it
was because he loved them or because he feared them that he dealt thus
tenderly with them, it was certainly an evidence of his want of zeal for
the honour of God and his sanctuary. He bound them over to God's
judgment, but he should have taken cognizance of their crimes himself,
as high priest and judge, and have restrained and punished them. What he
said was right, but it was not enough. Note, It is sometimes necessary
that we put an edge upon the reproofs we give. There are those that must
be saved with fear, [Jde 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#023.md). 3.
Their obstinacy against this reproof. His lenity did not at all work
upon them: They hearkened not to their father, though he was also a
judge. They had no regard either to his authority or to his affection,
which was to them an evident token of perdition; it was because the Lord
would slay them. They had long hardened their hearts, and now God, in a
way of righteous judgment, hardened their hearts, and seared their
consciences, and withheld from them the grace they had resisted and
forfeited. Note, Those that are deaf to the reproofs of wisdom are
manifestly marked for ruin. The Lord has determined to destroy them,
[Ch2 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#016.md). See [Pro
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#001.md). Immediately upon this, Samuel's
tractableness is again mentioned ([Sa1
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#026).md), to shame their obstinacy: The
child Samuel grew. God's grace is his own; he denied it to the sons of
the high priest and gave it to the child of an obscure country Levite.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa1 2:27</span></span>

Eli reproved his sons too gently, and did not threaten them as he
should, and therefore God sent a prophet to him to reprove him sharply,
and to threaten him, because, by his indulgence of them, he had
strengthened their hands in their wickedness. If good men be wanting in
their duty, and by their carelessness and remissness contribute any
thing to the sin of sinners, they must expect both to hear of it and to
smart for it. Eli's family was now nearer to God than all the families
of the earth, and therefore he will punish them, [Amo
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#002.md). The message is sent to Eli
himself, because God would bring him to repentance and save him; not to
his sons, whom he had determined to destroy. And it might have been a
means of awakening him to do his duty at last, and so to have prevented
the judgment, but we do not find it had any great effect upon him. The
message this prophet delivers from God is very close.

I. He reminds him of the great things God had done for the house of his
fathers and for his family. He appeared to Aaron in Egypt ([Exo
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#027).md), in the house of bondage, as a
token of further favour which he designed for him, [Sa1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#027.md). He advanced him to the
priesthood, entailed it upon his family, and thereby dignified it above
any of the families of Israel. He entrusted him with honourable work, to
offer on God's altar, to burn incense, and to wear that ephod in which
was the breast-plate of judgment. He settled upon him an honourable
maintenance, a share out of all the offerings made by fire, [Sa1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#028.md). What could he have done more for
them, to engage them to be faithful to him? Note, The distinguishing
favours we have received from God, especially those of the spiritual
priesthood, are great aggravations of sin, and will be remembered
against us in the day of account, if we profane our crown and betray our
trusts, [Deu 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#006.md); [Sa2
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#007.md), [Sa2
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#008.md).

II\. He exhibits a high charge against him and his family. His children
did wickedly, and he connived at it, and thereby involved himself in the
guilt; the indictment therefore runs against them all, [Sa1
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#029.md). 1. His sons had impiously
profaned the holy things of God: "You kick at my sacrifice which I have
commanded; not only trample upon the institution as a mean thing, but
spurn at it as a thing you hate to be tied up to." They did the utmost
despite imaginable to the offerings of the Lord when they committed all
that outrage and rapine about them that we read of, and violently
plundered the pots on which, in effect, Holiness to the Lord was written
([Zac 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#020).md), and took that fat to
themselves which God had appointed to be burnt on his altar. 2. Eli had
bolstered them up in it, by not punishing their insolence and impiety:
"Thou for thy part honourest thy sons above me," that is, "thou hadst
rather see my offerings disgraced by their profanation of them than see
thy sons disgraced by a legal censure upon them for so doing, which
ought to have been inflicted, even to suspension and deprivation ab
officio et beneficio - of their office and its emoluments." Those that
allow and countenance their children in any evil way, and do not use
their authority to restrain and punish them, do in effect honour them
more than God, being more tender of their reputation than of his glory
and more desirous to humour them than to honour him. 3. They had all
shared in the gains of the sacrilege. It is to be feared that Eli
himself, though he disliked and reproved the abuses they committed, yet
did not forbear to eat of the roast meat they sacrilegiously got, [Sa1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#015.md). He was a fat heavy man ([Sa1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#018).md), and therefore it is charged
upon the whole family (though Hophni and Phinehas were principally
guilty), You make yourselves fat with the chief of all the offerings.
God gave them sufficient to feed them, but that would not suffice; they
made themselves fat, and served their lusts with that which God was to
be served with. See [Hos 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#008.md).

III\. He declares the cutting off of the entail of the high priesthood
from his family ([Sa1 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#030).md): "The Lord
God of Israel, who is jealous for his own honour and Israel's, says, and
lets thee know it, that thy commission is revoked and superseded." I
said, indeed, that thy house, and the house of thy father Ithamar (for
from that younger son of Aaron Eli descended), should walk before me for
ever. Upon what occasion the dignity of the high priesthood was
transferred from the family of Eleazar to that of Ithamar does not
appear; but it seems this had been done, and Eli stood fair to have that
honour perpetuated to his posterity. But observe, the promise carried
its own condition along with it: They shall walk before me forever, that
is, "they shall have the honour, provided they faithfully do the
service." Walking before God is the great condition of the covenant,
[Gen 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001.md). Let them set me before
their face, and I will set them before my face continually ([Psa
41:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#012).md), otherwise not. But now the
Lord says, Be it far from me. "Now that you cast me off you can expect
no other than that I should cast you off; you will not walk before me as
you should, and therefore you shall not." Such wicked and abusive
servants God will discard, and turn out of his service. Some think there
is a further reach in this recall of the grant, and that it was not only
to be fulfilled shortly in the deposing of the posterity of Eli, when
Zadok, who descended from Eleazar, was put in Abiathar's room, but it
was to have its complete accomplishment at length in the total abolition
of the Levitical priesthood by the priesthood of Christ.

IV\. He gives a good reason for this revocation, taken from a settled
and standing rule of God's government, according to which all must
expect to be dealt with (like that by which Cain was tried, [Gen
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#007).md): Those that honour me I will
honour, and those that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.

1\. Observe in general, (1.) That God is the fountain of honour and
dishonour; he can exalt the meanest and put contempt upon the greatest.
(2.) As we deal with God we must expect to be dealt with by him, and yet
more favourably than we deserve. See [Psa
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#025.md), [Psa
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026.md).

2\. Particularly, (1.) Be it spoken, to the everlasting reputation of
religion or of serious godliness, that it gives honour to God and puts
honour upon men. By it we seek and serve the glory of God, and he will
be behind-hand with none that do so, but here and hereafter will secure
their glory. The way to be truly great is to be truly good. If we humble
and deny ourselves in any thing to honour God, and have a single eye to
him in it, we may depend upon this promise, he will put the best honour
upon us. See [Joh 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#026). (2..md) Be it
spoken, to the everlasting reproach of impiety or profaneness, that this
does dishonour to God (despises the greatest and best of beings, whom
angels adore) and will bring dishonour upon men, for those that do so
shall be lightly esteemed; not only God will lightly esteem them (that
perhaps they will not regard, as those that honour him value his honour,
of whom therefore it is said, I will honour them), but they shall be
lightly esteemed by all the world; the very honour they are proud of
shall be laid in the dust; they shall see themselves despised by all
mankind, their names a reproach; when they are gone, their memory shall
rot, and, when they rise again, it shall be to everlasting shame and
contempt. The dishonour which their impotent malice puts upon God and
his omnipotent justice will return upon their own heads, [Psa
79:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#012.md).

V. He foretels the particular judgments which should come upon his
family, to its perpetual ignominy. A curse should be entailed upon his
posterity, and a terrible curse it is, and shows how jealous God is in
the matters of his worship and how ill he takes it when those who are
bound by their character and profession to preserve and advance the
interests of his glory are false to their trust, and betray them. If
God's ministers be vicious and profane, of how much sorer punishment
will they be thought worthy, here and for ever, than other sinners! Let
such read the doom here passed on Eli's house, and tremble. It is
threatened,

1\. That their power should be broken ([Sa1
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#031).md): I will cut off thy arm, and the
arm of thy father's house. They should be stripped of all their
authority, should be deposed, and have no influence upon the people as
they had had. God would make them contemptible and base. See [Mal
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#008.md), [Mal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#009.md). The sons had abused their power
to oppress the people and encroach upon their rights, and the father had
not used his power, as he ought to have done, to restrain and punish
them, and therefore it was justly threatened that the arm should be cut
off which was not stretched out as it should have been.

2\. That their lives should be shortened. He was himself an old man; but
instead of using the wisdom, gravity, experience, and authority of his
age, for the service of God and the support of religion, he had suffered
the infirmities of age to make him more cool and remiss in his duty, and
therefore it is here threatened that none of his posterity should live
to be old, [Sa1 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#031.md), [Sa1
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#032.md). It is twice spoken: "There shall
not be an old man in thy house for ever;" and again ([Sa1
2:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#033).md), "All the increase of thy house,
from generation to generation, shall die in the flower of their age,
when they are in the midst of the years of their service," so that
though the family should not be extinct, yet it should never be
considerable, nor should any member of it come to be eminent in his day.
Bishop Patrick relates, out of some of the Jewish writers, that long
after this, there being a family in Jerusalem none of which commonly
lived above eighteen years, upon search it was found that they descended
from the house of Eli, on which this sentence was passed.

3\. That all their comforts should be embittered. (1.) The comfort they
had in the sanctuary, in its wealth and prosperity: Thou shalt see an
enemy in my habitation. This was fulfilled in the Philistines' invasions
and the mischiefs they did to Israel, by which the country was
impoverished ([Sa1 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#019).md), and no
doubt the priests' incomes were thereby very much impaired. The
captivity of the ark was such an act of hostility committed upon God's
habitation as broke Eli's heart. As it is a blessing to a family to see
peace upon Israel ([Psa 128:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#005.md), [Psa
128:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#006).md), so the contrary is a sore
judgment upon a family, especially a family of priests. (2.) The comfort
of their children: "The man of thine whom I shall not cut off by an
untimely death shall live to be a blot and burden to the family, a
scandal and vexation to his relations; he shall be to consume thy eyes
and grieve thy heart, for his foolishness or his sickliness, his
wickedness or his poverty." Grief for a dead child is great, but for a
bad child often greater.

4\. That their substance should be wasted and they should be reduced to
extreme poverty ([Sa1 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#036).md): "He that
is left alive in thy house shall have little joy of his life, for want
of a livelihood; he shall come and crouch to the succeeding family for a
subsistence." (1.) He shall beg for the smallest alms - a piece of
silver (and the word signifies the least piece) and a morsel of bread.
See how this answered the sin. Eli's sons must have the best pieces of
flesh, but their sons will be glad of a morsel of bread. Note, Want is
the just punishment of wantonness. Those who could not be content
without dainties and varieties are brought, they or theirs, to want
necessaries, and the Lord is righteous in thus visiting them. (2.) He
shall beg for the meanest office: Put me into somewhat belonging to the
priesthood (as it is in the original); make me as one of the hired
servants, the fittest place for a prodigal. Plenty and power are
forfeited when they are abused. They should not be able to pretend to
any good preferment, not to any place at the altar, but should petition
for some poor employment, be the work ever so hard and the wages ever so
small, so they might but get bread. This, it is probable, was fully
accomplished when Abiathar, who was of Eli's race, was deposed by
Solomon for treason, and he and his turned out of office in the temple
([Kg1 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#026.md), [Kg1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#027).md), by which it is easy to think
his posterity were reduced to the extremities here described.

5\. That God would shortly begin to execute these judgments in the death
of Hophni and Phinehas, the sad tidings of which Eli himself should live
to hear: This shall be a sign to thee, [Sa1
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#034.md). When thou hearest it, say, "Now
the word of God begins to operate; here is one threatening fulfilled,
from which I infer that all the rest will be fulfilled in their order."
Hophni and Phinehas had many a time sinned together, and it is here
foretold that they should die together both in one day. Bind these tares
in a bundle for the fire. This was fulfilled, [Sa1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#011.md).

VI\. In the midst of all these threatenings against the house of Eli,
here is mercy promised to Israel (v. 35): I will raise me up a faithful
priest. 1. This was fulfilled in Zadoc, of the family of Eleazar, who
came into Abiathar's place in the beginning of Solomon's reign, and was
faithful to his trust; and the high priests were of his posterity as
long as the Levitical priesthood continued. Note, The wickedness of
ministers, though it destroy themselves, yet it shall not destroy the
ministry. How bad soever the officers are, the office shall continue
always to the end of the world. If some betray their trust, yet others
shall be raised up that will be true to it. God's work shall never fall
to the ground for want of hands to carry it on. The high priest is here
said to walk before God's anointed (that is, David and his seed) because
he wore the breast-plate of judgment, which he was to consult, not in
common cases, but for the king, in the affairs of state. Note,
Notwithstanding the degeneracy we see and lament in many families, God
will secure to himself a succession. If some grow worse than their
ancestors, others, to balance that, shall grow better. 2. It has its
full accomplishment in the priesthood of Christ, that merciful and
faithful high priest whom God raised up when the Levitical priesthood
was thrown off, who in all things did his father's mind, and for whom
God will build a sure house, build it on a rock, so that the gates of
hell cannot prevail against it.
