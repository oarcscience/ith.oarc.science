### [Isaiah Chapter 52](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 52:0</span></span>

The greater part of this chapter is on the same subject with the chapter
before, concerning the deliverance of the Jews out of Babylon, which yet
is applicable to the great salvation Christ has wrought out for us; but
the last three verses are on the same subject with the following
chapter, concerning the person of the Redeemer, his humiliation and
exaltation. Observe, I. The encouragement that is given to the Jews in
captivity to hope that God would deliver them in his own way and time
([Isa 52:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001).md). II. The great joy and
rejoicing that shall be both with ministers and people upon that
occasion ([Isa 52:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007).md). III. The call
given to those that remained in captivity to shift for their own
enlargement when liberty was proclaimed ([Isa
52:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#011.md), [Isa
52:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#012).md). IV. A short idea given here of
the Messiah, which is enlarged upon in the next chapter ([Isa
52:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013).md).

[Isaiah 52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 52:1</span></span>

Here, I. God's people are stirred up to appear vigorous for their own
deliverance, [Isa 52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001.md), [Isa
52:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#002.md). They had desired that God would
awake and put on his strength, [Isa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009.md). Here he calls upon them to awake
and put on their strength, to bestir themselves; let them awake from
their despondency, and pluck up their spirits, encourage themselves and
one another with the hope that all will be well yet, and no longer
succumb and sink under their burden. Let them awake from their distrust,
look above them, look about them, look into the promises, look into the
providences of God that were working for them, and let them raise their
expectations of great things from God. Let them awake from their
dullness, sluggishness, and incogitancy, and raise up their endeavours,
not to take any irregular courses for their own relief, contrary to the
law of nations concerning captives, but to use all likely means to
recommend themselves to the favour of the conqueror and make an interest
with him. God here gives them an assurance, 1. That they should be
reformed by their captivity: There shall no more come into thee the
uncircumcised and the unclean ([Isa
52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001).md); their idolatrous customs should
be no more introduced, or at least not harboured; for when by the
marriage of strange wives, in Ezra's time and Nehemiah's, the unclean
crept in, they were soon by the vigilance and zeal of the magistrates
expelled again, and care was taken that Jerusalem should be a holy city.
Thus the gospel Jerusalem is purified by the blood of Christ and the
grace of God, and made indeed a holy city. 2. That they should be
relieved and rescued out of their captivity, that the bands of their
necks should be loosed, that they should not now be any longer
oppressed, nay, that they should not be any more invaded, as they had
been: There shall no more come against thee (so it may be read) the
uncircumcised and the clean. The heathen shall not again enter into
God's sanctuary and profane his temple, [Psa
79:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001.md). This must be understood with a
condition. If they keep close to God, and keep in with him, God will
keep off, will keep out of the enemy; but, if they again corrupt
themselves, Antiochus will profane their temple and the Romans will
destroy it. However, for some time they shall have peace. And to this
happy change, now approaching, they are here called to accommodate
themselves. (1.) Let them prepare for joy: "Put on thy beautiful
garments, no longer to appear in mourning weeds and the habit of thy
widowhood. Put on a new face, a smiling countenance, now that a new and
pleasant scene begins to open." The beautiful garments were laid up
then, when the harps were hung on the willow trees; but, now there is
occasion for both, let both be resumed together. "Put on thy strength,
and, in order to that, put on thy beautiful garments, in token of
triumph and rejoicing." Note, The joy of the Lord will be our strength
([Neh 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#010).md), and our beautiful
garments will serve for armour of proof against the darts of temptation
and trouble. And observe, Jerusalem must put on her beautiful garments
when she becomes a holy city, for the beauty of holiness is the most
amiable beauty, and the more holy we are the more cause we have to
rejoice. (2.) Let them prepare for liberty: "Shake thyself from the dust
in which thou hast lain, and into which thy proud oppressors have
trodden thee ([Isa 51:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#023).md), or into
which thou hast in thy extreme sorrow rolled thyself." Arise, and set
up; so it may be read. "O Jerusalem! prepare to get clear of all the
marks of servitude thou hast been under and to shift thy quarters: Loose
thyself from the bands of thy neck; be inspired with generous principles
and resolutions to assert thy own liberty." The gospel proclaims liberty
to those who were bound with fears and makes it their duty to take hold
of their liberty. Let those who have been weary and heavily laden under
the burden of sin, finding relief in Christ, shake themselves from the
dust of their doubts and fears and loose themselves from those bands;
for, if the Son make them free, they shall be free indeed.

II\. God stirs up himself to appear jealous for the deliverance of his
people. He here pleads their cause with himself, and even stirs up
himself to come and save them, for his reasons of mercy are fetched from
himself. Several things he here considers.

1\. That the Chaldeans who oppressed them never acknowledged God in the
power they gained over his people, any more than Sennacherib did, who,
when God made use of him as an instrument for the correction and
reformation of his people, meant not so, [Isa
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#006.md), [Isa
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#007.md). "You have sold yourselves for
nought; you got nothing by it, nor did I," [Isa
52:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#003.md). (God considers that when they by
sin had sold themselves he himself, who had the prior, nay, the sole,
title to them, did not increase his wealth by their price, [Psa
44:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#012.md). They did not so much as pay
their debts to him with it; the Babylonians gave him no thanks for them,
but rather reproached and blasphemed his name upon that account.) "And
therefore they, having so long had you for nothing, shall at last
restore you for nothing: You shall be redeemed without price," as was
promised, [Isa 45:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013.md). Those that give
nothing must expect to get nothing; however, God is a debtor to no man.

2\. That they had been often before in similar distress, had often
smarted for a time under the tyranny of their task-masters, and
therefore it was a pity that they should now be left always in the hand
of these oppressors ([Isa 52:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#004).md): "My
people went down into Egypt, in an amicable way to settle there; but
they enslaved them, and ruled them with rigour." And then they were
delivered, notwithstanding the pride, and power, and policies of
Pharaoh. And why may we not think God will deliver his people now? At
other times the Assyrian oppressed the people of God without cause, as
when the ten tribes were carried away captive by the king of Assyria;
soon afterwards Sennacherib, another Assyrian, with a destroying army
oppressed and made himself master of all the defenced cities of Judah.
The Babylonians might not unfitly be called Assyrians, their monarchy
being a branch of the Assyrians; and they now oppressed them without
cause. Though God was righteous in delivering them into their hands,
they were unrighteous in using them as they did, and could not pretend a
dominion over them as their subjects, as Pharaoh might when they were
settled in Goshen, part of his kingdom. When we suffer by the hands of
wicked and unreasonable men it is some comfort to be able to say that as
to them it is without cause, that we have not given them any
provocation, [Psa 7:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#003.md), etc.

3\. That God's glory suffered by the injuries that were done to his
people ([Isa 52:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#005).md): What have I here,
what do I get by it, that my people are taken away for nought? God is
not worshipped as he used to be in Jerusalem, his altar there is gone
and his temple in ruins; but if, in lieu of that, he were more and
better worshipped in Babylon, either by the captives or by the natives,
it were another matter - God might be looked upon as in some respects a
gainer in his honour by it; but, alas! it is not so. (1.) The captives
are so dispirited that they cannot praise him; instead of this they are
continually howling, which grieves him and moves his pity; Those that
rule over them make them to howl, as the Egyptians of old made them to
sigh, [Exo 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#023.md). So the Babylonians
now, using them more hardly, extorted from them louder complaints and
made them to howl. This gives us no pleasing idea of the temper the
captives were now in; their complaints were not so rational and pious as
they should have been, but brutish rather; they howled, [Hos
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#014.md). However God heard them, and came
down to deliver them, as he did out of Egypt, [Exo
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#007.md), [Exo
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008). (2..md) The natives are so insolent
that they will not praise him, but, instead of that, they are
continually blaspheming, which affronts him and moves his anger. They
boasted that they were too hard for God because they were too hard for
his people, and set him at defiance, as unable to deliver them, and thus
his name continually every day was blasphemed among them. When they
praised their own idols they lifted up themselves against the Lord of
heaven, [Dan 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#023.md). "Now," says God,
"this is not to be suffered. I will go down to deliver them; for what
honour, what rent, what tribute of praise have I from the world, when my
people, who should be to me for a name and praise, are to me for a
reproach? For their oppressors will neither praise God themselves nor
let them do it." The apostle quotes this with application to the wicked
lives of the Jews, by which God was dishonoured among the Gentiles then,
as much as now he was by their sufferings, [Rom
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#023.md), [Rom
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#024.md).

4\. That his glory would be greatly manifested by their deliverance
([Isa 52:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#006).md): "Therefore, because my
name is thus blasphemed, I will arise, and my people shall know my name,
my name Jehovah." By this name he had made himself known in delivering
them out of Egypt, [Exo 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003.md). God will
do something to vindicate his own honour, something for his great name;
and his people, who have almost lost the knowledge of it, shall know it
to their comfort and shall find it their strong tower. They shall know
that God's providence governs the world, and all the affairs of it, that
it is he who speaks deliverance for them by the word of his power, that
it is he who speaks deliverance for them by the word of his power, that
it is he only, who at first spoke and it was done. They shall know that
God's word, which Israel is blessed with above other nations, shall
without fail have its accomplishment in due season, that it is he who
speaks by the prophet; it is he, and they do not speak of themselves;
for not one iota or tittle of what they say shall fall to the ground.

[Isaiah 52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 52:7</span></span>

The removal of the Jews from Babylon to their own land again is here
spoken of both as a mercy and as a duty; and the application of [Isa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007.md) to the preaching of the gospel
(by the apostle, [Rom 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#015).md) plainly
intimates that that deliverance was a type and figure of the redemption
of mankind by Jesus Christ, to which what is here said of their
redemption out of Babylon ought to be accommodated.

I. It is here spoken of as a great blessing, which ought to be welcomed
with abundance of joy and thankfulness. 1. Those that bring the tidings
of their release shall be very acceptable ([Isa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007).md): "How beautiful upon the
mountains, the mountains round about Jerusalem, over which these
messengers are seen coming at a distance, how beautiful are their feet,
when it is known what tidings they bring!" It is not meant so much of
the common posts, or the messengers sent express by the government to
disperse the proclamation, but rather of some of the Jews themselves,
who, being at the fountain-head of intelligence, had early notice of it,
and immediately went themselves, or sent their own messengers, to all
parts, to disperse the news, and even to Jerusalem itself, to tell the
few who remained there that their brethren would be with them shortly;
for it is published not merely as matter of news, but as a proof that
Zion's God reigns, for in that language it is published: they say unto
Zion, Thy God reigns. Those who bring the tidings of peace and
salvation, that Cyrus has given orders for the release of the Jews,
tidings which were so long expected by those that waited for the
consolation of Israel, those good tidings (so the original reads it,
without the tautology of our translation, good tidings of good), put
this construction upon it, O Zion! thy God reigns. Note, When bad news
is abroad this is good news, and when good news is abroad this is the
best news, that Zion's God reigns, that God is Zion's God, in covenant
with her, and as such he reigns, [Psa
146:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#010.md); [Zac
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009.md). The Lord has founded Zion, [Isa
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#032.md). All events have their rise in
the disposals of the kingdom of his providence and their tendency to the
advancement of the kingdom of his grace. This must be applied to the
preaching of the gospel, which is a proclamation of peace and salvation;
it is gospel indeed, good news, glad tidings, tidings of victory over
our spiritual enemies and liberty from our spiritual bondage. The good
news is that the Lord Jesus reigns and all power is given to him. Christ
himself brought these tidings first ([Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md), [Heb
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#003).md), and of him the text speaks: How
beautiful are his feet! his feet that were nailed to the cross, how
beautiful upon Mount Calvary! his feet when he came leaping upon the
mountains ([Sol 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#008).md), how beautiful
were they to those who knew his voice and knew it to be the voice of
their beloved! His ministers proclaim these good tidings; they ought to
keep their feet clean from the pollutions of the world, and then they
ought to be beautiful in the eyes of those to whom they are sent, who
sit at their feet, or rather at Christ's in them, to hear his word. They
must be esteemed in love for their work's sake ([Th1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#013).md), for their message sake, which
is well worthy of all acceptation. 2. Those to whom the tidings are
brought shall be put thereby into a transport of joy. (1.) Zion's
watchmen shall then rejoice because they are surprisingly illuminated,
[Isa 52:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#008.md). The watchmen on Jerusalem's
walls shall lead the chorus in this triumph. Who they were we are told,
[Isa 62:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006.md). They were such as God set
on the walls of Jerusalem, to make mention of his name, and to continue
instant in prayer to him, till he again made Jerusalem a praise in the
earth. These watchmen stand upon their watch-tower, waiting for an
answer to their prayers ([Hab 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001).md);
and therefore when the good news comes they have it first, and the
longer they have continued and the more importunate they have been in
praying for it the more will they be elevated when it comes: They shall
lift up the voice, with the voice together shall they sing in concert,
to invite others to join with them in their praises. And that which
above all things will transport them with pleasure is that they shall
see eye to eye, that is, face to face. Whereas God had been a God hiding
himself, and they could scarcely discern any thing of his favour through
the dark cloud of their afflictions, now that the cloud is scattered
they shall plainly see it. They shall see Zion's king eye to eye; so it
was fulfilled when the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and there
were those that saw his glory ([Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014).md) and looked upon it, [Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001.md). They shall see an exact agreement
and correspondence between the prophecy and the event, the promise and
the performance; they shall see how they look one upon another eye to
eye, and be satisfied that the same God spoke the one and did the other.
When the Lord shall bring again Zion out of her captivity the prophets
shall thence receive and give fuller discoveries than ever of God's
good-will to his people. Applying this also, as the foregoing verse, to
gospel times, it is a promise of the pouring out of the Spirit upon
gospel ministers, as a spirit of wisdom and revelation, to lead them
into all truth, so that they shall see eye to eye, shall see God's grace
more clearly than the Old Testament saints could see it: and they shall
herein be unanimous; in these great things concerning the common
salvation they shall concur in their sentiments as well as their songs.
Nay, St. Paul seems to allude to this when he makes it the privilege of
our future state that we shall see face to face. (2.) Zion's waste
places shall then rejoice because they shall be surprisingly comforted
([Isa 52:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#009).md): Break forth into joy,
sing together, you waste places of Jerusalem; that is, all parts of
Jerusalem, for it was all in ruins, and even those parts that seemed to
lie most desolate shall share in the joy; and they, having little
expected it, shall break forth into joy, as men that dream, [Psa
126:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001.md), [Psa
126:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#002.md). Let them sing together. Note,
Those that share in mercies ought to join in praises. Here is matter for
joy and praise. \[1.\] God's people will have the comfort of this
salvation; and what is the matter of our rejoicing ought to be the
matter of our thanksgiving. He has redeemed Jerusalem (the inhabitants
of Jerusalem that were sold into the hands of their enemies) and thereby
he has comforted his people that were in sorrow. The redemption of
Jerusalem is the joy of all God's people, whose character it is that
they look for that redemption, [Luk
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#038.md). \[2.\] God will have the glory
of it, [Isa 52:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#010.md). He has made bare
his holy arm (manifested and displayed his power) in the eyes of all the
nations. God's arm is a holy arm, stretched out in purity and justice,
in defence of holiness and in pursuance of his promise. \[3.\] All the
world will have the benefit of it. In the great salvation wrought out by
our Lord Jesus the arm of the Lord was revealed and all the ends of the
earth were made to see the great salvation, not as spectators of it
only, as they saw the deliverance of the Jews out of Babylon, but as
sharers in it; some of all nations, the most remote, shall partake of
the benefits of the redemption. This is applied to our salvation by
Christ. [Luk 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#006.md), All flesh shall see
the salvation of God, that great salvation.

II\. It is here spoken of as a great business, which ought to be managed
with abundance of care and circumcision. When the liberty is proclaimed,
1. Let the people of God hasten out of Babylon with all convenient
speed; though they are ever so well settled there, let them not think of
taking root in Babylon, but Depart, depart ([Isa
52:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#011).md), go out from the midst of her;
not only those that are in the borders, but those that are in the midst,
in the heart of the country, let them be gone. Babylon is no place for
Israelites. As soon as they have leave to let go, let them lose no time.
With this word God stirred up the spirits of those that were moved to go
up, [Ezr 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#005.md). And it is a call to all
those who are yet in the bondage of sin and Satan to make use of the
liberty which Christ has proclaimed to them. And, if the Son make them
free, they shall be free indeed. 2. Let them take heed of carrying away
with them any of the pollutions of Babylon: Touch no unclean thing. Now
that God makes bare his holy arm for you, be you holy as he is, and keep
yourselves from every wicked thing. When they came out of Egypt they
brought with them the idolatrous customs of Egypt ([Eze
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#003).md), which were their ruin; let them
take heed of doing so now that they come out of Babylon. Note, When we
are receiving any special mercy from God we ought more carefully than
ever to watch against all impurity. But especially let those be clean
who bear the vessels of the Lord, that is, the priests, who had the
charge of the vessels of the sanctuary (when they were restored by a
particular grant) to carry them to Jerusalem, [Ezr
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#007.md); [Ezr
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#024.md), etc. Let them not only avoid
touching any unclean thing, but be very careful to cleanse themselves
according to the purification of the sanctuary. Christians are made to
our God spiritual priests, [Rev 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006.md).
They are to bear the vessels of the Lord, are entrusted to keep the
ordinances of God pure and entire; it is a good thing that is committed
to them, and they ought to be clean, to wash their hands in innocency
and so to compass God's altars and carry his vessels, and keep
themselves pure. 3. Let them depend upon the presence of God with them
and his protection in their removal ([Isa
52:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#012).md): You shall not go out with
haste. They were to go with a diligent haste, not to lose time nor
linger as Lot in Sodom, but they were not to go with a diffident
distrustful haste, as if they were afraid of being pursued (as when they
came out of Egypt) or of having the orders for their release recalled
and countermanded: no, they shall find that, as for God, his work is
perfect, and therefore they need not make more haste than good speed.
Cyrus shall give them an honourable discharge, and they shall have an
honourable return, and not steal away; for the Lord will go before them
as their general and commander-in-chief, and the God of Israel will be
their rearward, or he that will gather up those that are left behind.
God will both lead their van and bring up their rear; he will secure
them from enemies that either meet them or follow them, for with his
favour will he compass them. The pillar of cloud and fire, when they
came out of Egypt, sometimes went behind them, to secure their rear
([Exo 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#019).md), and God's presence with
them would now be that to them which that pillar was a visible token of.
Those that are in the way of their duty are under God's special
protection; and he that believes this will not make haste.

[Isaiah 52:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 52:13</span></span>

Here, as in other places, for the confirming of the faith of God's
people and the encouraging of their hope in the promises of temporal
deliverances, the prophet passes from them to speak of the great
salvation which should in the fulness of time be wrought out by the
Messiah. As the prophecy of Christ's incarnation was intended for the
ratification of the promise of their deliverance from the Assyrian army,
so this of Christ's death and resurrection is to confirm the promise of
their return out of Babylon; for both these salvations were typical of
the great redemption and the prophecies of them had a reference to that.
This prophecy, which begins here and is continued to the end of the next
chapter, points as plainly as can be at Jesus Christ; the ancient Jews
understood it of the Messiah, though the modern Jews take a great deal
of pains to pervert it, and some of ours (no friends therein to the
Christian religion) will have it understood of Jeremiah; but Philip, who
hence preached Christ to the eunuch, has put it past dispute that of him
speaks the prophet this, of him and of no other man, [Act
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#034.md), [Act
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#035.md). Here,

I. God owns Christ to be both commissioned and qualified for his
undertaking. 1. He is appointed to it. "He is my servant, whom I employ
and therefore will uphold." In his undertaking he does his Father's
will, seeks his Father's honour, and serves the interests of his
Father's kingdom. 2. He is qualified for it. He shall deal prudently,
for the spirit of wisdom and understanding shall rest upon him, [Isa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002.md). The word is used concerning
David when he behaved himself wisely, [Sa1
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#014.md). Christ is wisdom itself, and,
in the contriving and carrying on the work of our redemption, there
appeared much of the wisdom of God in a mystery, [Co1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007.md). Christ, when he was here upon
earth, dealt very prudently, to the admiration of all.

II\. He gives a short prospect both of his humiliation and his
exaltation. See here, 1. How he humbled himself: Many were astonished at
him, as they were at David when by reason of his sorrows and troubles he
became a wonder unto many, [Psa 71:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#007.md).
Many wondered to see what base usage he met with, how inveterate people
were against him, how inhuman, and what indignities were done him: His
visage was marred more than any man's when he was buffeted, smitten on
the cheek, and crowned with thorns, and hid not his face from shame and
spitting. His face was foul with weeping, for he was a man of sorrows;
he that really was fairer than the children of men had his face spoiled
with the abuses that were done him. Never was man used so barbarously;
his form, when he took upon him the form of a servant, was more mean and
abject than that of any of the sons of men. Those that saw him said,
"Surely never man looked so miserably, a worm and no man," [Psa
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#006.md). The nation abhorred him ([Isa
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007).md), treated him as the off-scouring
of all things. Never was sorrow like unto his sorrow. 2. How highly God
exalted him, and exalted him because he humbled himself. Three words are
used for this ([Isa 52:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013).md): He shalt
be exalted and extolled and be very high. God shall exalt him, men shall
extol him, and with both he shall be very high, higher than the highest,
higher than the heavens. He shall prosper in his work, and succeed in
it, and that shall raise him very high. (1.) Many nations shall be the
better for him, for he shall sprinkle them, and not the Jews only; the
blood of sprinkling shall be applied to their consciences, to purify
them. He suffered, and died, and so sprinkled many nations; for in his
death there was a fountain opened, [Zac
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001.md). He shall sprinkle many nations
by his heavenly doctrine, which shall drop as the rain and distil as the
dew. Moses's did so only on one nation ([Deu
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002).md), but Christ's on many nations.
He shall do it by baptism, which is the washing of the body with pure
water, [Heb 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022.md). So that this
promise had its accomplishment when Christ sent his apostles to disciple
all nations, by baptizing or sprinkling them. (2.) The great ones of the
nation shall show him respect: Kings shall shut their mouths at him,
that is, they shall not open their mouths against him, as they have
done, to contradict and blaspheme his sacred oracles; nay, they shall
acquiesce in, and be well pleased with, the methods he takes of setting
up his kingdom in the world; they shall with great humility and
reverence receive his oracles and laws, as those who, when they heard
Job's wisdom, after his speech spoke not again, [Job
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#009.md), [Job
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#022.md). Kings shall see and arise, [Isa
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007). (3..md) The mystery which was kept
secret from the beginning of the world shall by him be made known to all
nations for the obedience of faith, as the apostle speaks, [Rom
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025.md), [Rom
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#026.md). That which had not been told
them shall they see; the gospel brings to light things new and unheard
of, which will awaken the attention and engage the reverence of kings
and kingdoms. This is applied to the preaching of the gospel in the
Gentile world, [Rom 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#021.md). These words
are there quoted according to the Septuagint translation: To whom he was
not spoken of they shall see, and those that have not heard shall
understand. As the things revealed had long been kept secret, so the
persons to whom they were revealed had long been kept in the dark; but
now they shall see and consider the glory of God shining in the face of
Christ, which before they had not been told of - they had not heard.
That shall be discovered to them by the gospel of Christ which could
never be told them by all the learning of their philosophers, or the art
of their diviners, or any of their pagan oracles. Much had been said in
the Old Testament concerning the Messiah; much had been told them, and
they had heard it. But, as the queen of Sheba found concerning Solomon,
what they shall see in him, when he comes, shall far exceed what had
been told them. Christ disappointed the expectations of those who looked
for a Messiah according to their fancies, as the carnal Jews, but outdid
theirs who looked for such a Messiah as was promised. According to their
faith, nay, and beyond it, it was to them.
