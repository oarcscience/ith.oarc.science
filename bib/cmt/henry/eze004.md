### [Ezekiel Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 4:0</span></span>

Ezekiel was now among the captives in Babylon, but they there had
Jerusalem still upon their hearts; the pious captives looked towards it
with an eye of faith (as [Dan 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#010).md),
the presumptuous ones looked towards it with an eye of pride, and
flattered themselves with a conceit that they should shortly return
thither again; those that remained corresponded with the captives, and,
it is likely, bouyed them up with hopes that all would be well yet, as
long as Jerusalem was standing in its strength, and perhaps upbraided
those with their folly who had surrendered at first; therefore, to take
down this presumption, God gives the prophet, in this chapter, a very
clear and affecting foresight of the besieging of Jerusalem by the
Chaldean army and the calamities which would attend that siege. Two
things are here represented to him in vision: - I. The fortifications
that should be raised against the city; this is signified by the
prophet's laying siege to the portraiture of Jerusalem ([Eze
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001).md) and laying first on one side
and then on the other side before it ([Eze
4:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#004).md). II. The famine that should
rage within the city; this is signified by his eating very coarse fare,
and confining himself to a little of it, so long as this typical
representation lasted ([Eze 4:9-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#009).md).

[Ezekiel 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 4:1</span></span>

The prophet is here ordered to represent to himself and others by signs
which would be proper and powerful to strike the fancy and to affect the
mind, the siege of Jerusalem; and this amounted to a prediction.

I. He was ordered to engrave a draught of Jerusalem upon a tile, [Eze
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001.md). It was Jerusalem's honour that
while she kept her integrity God had graven her upon the palms of his
hands ([Isa 49:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#016).md), and the names of
the tribes were engraven in precious stones on the breast-plate of the
high priest; but, now that the faithful city has become a harlot, a
worthless brittle tile or brick is thought good enough to portray it
upon. This the prophet must lay before him, that the eye may affect the
heart.

II\. He was ordered to build little forts against this portraiture of
the city, resembling the batteries raised by the besiegers, [Eze
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#002.md). Between the city that was
besieged and himself that was the besieger he was to set up an iron pan,
as an iron wall, [Eze 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#003.md). This
represented the inflexible resolution of both sides; the Chaldeans
resolved, whatever it cost them, that they would make themselves masters
of the city and would never quit it till they had conquered it; on the
other side, the Jews resolved never to capitulate, but to hold out to
the last extremity.

III\. He was ordered to lie upon his side before it, as it were to
surround it, representing the Chaldean army lying before it to block it
up, to keep the meat from going in and the mouths from going out. He was
to lie on his left side 390 days ([Eze
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#005).md), about thirteen months; the siege
of Jerusalem is computed to last eighteen months ([Jer
52:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#004).md), but if we deduct from that
five months' interval, when the besiegers withdrew upon the approach of
Pharaoh's army ([Jer 37:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005).md), the
number of the days of the close siege will be 390. Yet that also had
another signification. The 390 days, according to the prophetic dialect,
signified 390 years; and, when the prophet lies so many days on his
side, he bears the guilt of that iniquity which the house of Israel, the
ten tribes, had borne 390 years, reckoning from their first apostasy
under Jeroboam to the destruction of Jerusalem, which completed the ruin
of those small remains of them that had incorporated with Judah. He is
then to lie forty days upon his right side, and so long to bear the
iniquity of the house of Judah, the kingdom of the two tribes, because
the measure-filling sins of that people were those which they were
guilty of during the last forty years before their captivity, since the
thirteenth year of Josiah, when Jeremiah began to prophesy ([Jer
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md), [Jer
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#002).md), or, as some reckon it, since the
eighteenth, when the book of the law was found and the people renewed
their covenant with God. When they persisted in their impieties and
idolatries, notwithstanding they had such a prophet and such a prince,
and were brought into the bond of such a covenant, what could be
expected but ruin without remedy? Judah, that had such helps and
advantages for reformation, fills the measure of its iniquity in less
time than Israel does. Now we are not to think that the prophet lay
constantly night and day upon his side, but every day, for so many days
together, at a certain time of the day, when he received visits, and
company came in, he was found lying 390 days on his left side and forty
days on his right side before his portraiture of Jerusalem, which all
that saw might easily understand to mean the close besieging of that
city, and people would be flocking in daily, some for curiosity and some
for conscience, at the hour appointed, to see it and to take their
different remarks upon it. His being found constantly on the same side,
as if bands were laid upon him (as indeed they were by the divine
command), so that he could not turn himself from one side to another
till he had ended the days of the siege, did plainly represent the close
and constant continuance of the besiegers about the city during that
number of days, till they had gained their point.

IV\. He was ordered to prosecute the siege with vigour ([Eze
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#007).md): Thou shalt set thy face towards
the siege of Jerusalem, as wholly intent upon it and resolved to carry
it; so the Chaldeans would be, and neither bribed nor forced to withdraw
from it. Nebuchadnezzar's indignation at Zedekiah's treachery in
breaking his league with him made him very furious in pushing on this
siege, that he might chastise the insolence of that faithless prince and
people; and his army promised themselves a rich booty of that pompous
city; so that both set their faces against it, for they were very
resolute. Nor were they less active and industrious, exerting themselves
to the utmost in all the operations of the siege, which the prophet was
to represent by the uncovering of his arm, or, as some read it, the
stretching out of his arm, as it were to deal blows about without mercy.
When God is about to do some great work he is said to make bare his arm,
[Isa 52:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#010.md). In short, The Chaldeans
will go about their business, and go on in it, as men in earnest, who
resolve to go through with it. Now, 1. This is intended to be a sign to
the house of Israel ([Eze 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#003).md), both
to those in Babylon, who were eye-witnesses of what the prophet did, and
to those also who remained in their own land, who would hear the report
of it. The prophet was dumb and could not speak ([Eze
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#026).md); but as his silence had a voice,
and upbraided the people with their deafness, so even then God left not
himself without witness, but ordered him to make signs, as dumb men are
accustomed to do, and as Zacharias did when he was dumb, and by them to
make known his mind (that is, the mind of God) to the people. And thus
likewise the people were upbraided with their stupidity and dulness,
that they were not capable of being taught as men of sense are, by
words, but must be taught as children are, by pictures, or as deaf men
are, by signs. Or, perhaps, they are hereby upbraided with their malice
against the prophet. Had he spoken in words at length what was signified
by these figures, they would have entangled him in his talk, would have
indicted him for treasonable expressions, for they knew how to make a
man an offender for a word ([Isa
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#021).md), to avoid which he is ordered
to make use of signs. Or the prophet made use of signs for the same
reason that Christ made use of parables, that hearing they might hear
and not understand, and seeing they might see and not perceive, [Mat
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#014.md), [Mat
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#015.md). They would not understand what
was plain, and therefore shall be taught by that which is difficult; and
herein the Lord was righteous. 2. Thus the prophet prophesies against
Jerusalem ([Eze 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#007).md); and there were
those who not only understood it so, but were the more affected with it
by its being so represented, for images to the eye commonly make deeper
impressions upon the mind than words can, and for this reason sacraments
are instituted to represent divine things, that we might see and
believe, might see and be affected with those things; and we may expect
this benefit by them, and a blessing to go along with them, while (as
the prophet here) we make use only of such signs as God himself has
expressly appointed, which, we must conclude, are the fittest. Note, The
power of imagination, if it be rightly used, and kept under the
direction and correction of reason and faith, may be of good use to
kindle and excite pious and devout affections, as it was here to Ezekiel
and his attendants. "Methinks I see so and so, myself dying, time
expiring, the world on fire, the dead rising, the great tribunal set,
and the like, may have an exceedingly good influence upon us: for fancy
is like fire, a good servant, but a bad master." 3. This whole
transaction has that in it which the prophet might, with a good colour
of reason, have hesitated at and excepted against, and yet, in obedience
to God's command, and in execution of his office, he did it according to
order. (1.) It seemed childish and ludicrous, and beneath his gravity,
and there were those that would ridicule him for it; but he knew the
divine appointment put honour enough upon that which otherwise seemed
mean to save his reputation in the doing of it. (2.) It was toilsome and
tiresome to do as he did; but our ease as well as our credit must be
sacrificed to our duty, and we must never call God's service in any
instance of it a hard service. (3.) It could not but be very much
against the grain with him to appear thus against Jerusalem, the city of
God, the holy city, to act as an enemy against a place to which he was
so good a friend; but he is a prophet, and must follow his instructions,
not his affections, and must plainly preach the ruin of a sinful place,
though its welfare is what he passionately desires and earnestly prays
for. 4. All this that the prophet sets before the children of his people
concerning the destruction of Jerusalem is designed to bring them to
repentance, by showing them sin, the provoking cause of this
destruction, sin the ruin of that once flourishing city, than which
surely nothing could be more effectual to make them hate sin and turn
from it; while he thus in lively colours describes the calamity with a
great deal of pain and uneasiness to himself, he is bearing the iniquity
of Israel and Judah. "Look here" (says he) "and see what work sin makes,
what an evil and bitter thing it is to depart form God; this comes of
sin, your sins and the sin of your fathers; let that therefore be the
daily matter of your sorrow and shame now in your captivity, that you
may make your peace with God and he may return in mercy to you." But
observe, It is a day of punishment for a year of sin: I have appointed
thee each day for a year. The siege is a calamity of 390 days, in which
God reckons for the iniquity of 390 years; justly therefore d they
acknowledge that God had punished them less than their iniquity
deserved, [Ezr 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#013.md). But let
impenitent sinners know that, though now God is long-suffering towards
them, in the other world there is an everlasting punishment. When God
laid bands upon the prophet, it was to show them how they were bound
with the cords of their own transgression ([Lam
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#014).md), and therefore they were now
holden in the cords of affliction. But we may well think of the
prophet's case with compassion, when God laid upon him the bands of
duty, as he does on all his ministers ([Co1
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#016.md), Necessity is laid upon me, and
woe unto me if I preach not the gospel); and yet men laid upon him bonds
of restraint ([Eze 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#025).md); but under
both it is satisfaction enough that they are serving the interests of
God's kingdom among men.

[Ezekiel 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 4:9</span></span>

The best exposition of this part of Ezekiel's prediction of Jerusalem's
desolation is Jeremiah's lamentation of it, [Lam
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#003.md), [Lam
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#004.md), etc., and [Lam
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#010.md), where he pathetically describes
the terrible famine that was in Jerusalem during the siege and the sad
effects of it.

I. The prophet here, to affect the people with the foresight of it, must
confine himself for 390 days to coarse fare and short commons, and that
ill-dressed, for they should want both food and fuel.

1\. His meat, for the quality of it, was to be of the worst bread, made
of but little wheat and barley, and the rest of beans, and lentiles, and
millet, and fitches, such as we feed horses or fatted hogs with, and
this mixed, as mill corn, or as that in the beggar's bag, that has a
dish full of one sort of corn at one house and of another at another
house; of such corn as this must the prophet's bread be made while he
underwent the fatigue of lying on his side, and needed something better
to support him, [Eze 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#009.md). Note, It is
our wisdom not to be too fond of dainties and pleasant bread, because we
know not what hard meat we may be tied to, nay, and may be glad of,
before we die. The meanest sort of food is better than we deserve, and
therefore must not be despised nor wasted, nor must those that use it be
looked upon with disdain, because we know not what may be our own lot.

2\. For the quantity of it, it was to be of the least that a man could
be kept alive with, to signify that the besieged should be reduced to
short allowance and should hold out till all the bread in the city was
spent, [Jer 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#021.md). The prophet must
eat but twenty shekels' weight of bread a day ([Eze
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#010).md), that was about ten ounces; and
he must drink but the sixth part of a hin of water, that was half a
pint, about eight ounces, [Eze 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#011.md).
The stint of the Lessian diet is fourteen ounces of meat and sixteen of
drink. The prophet in Babylon had bread enough and to spare, and was by
the river side, where there was plenty of water; and yet, that he might
confirm his own prediction and be a sign to the children of Israel, God
obliges him to live thus sparingly, and he submits to it. Note, God's
servants must learn to endure hardness, and to deny themselves the use
of lawful delights, when they may thereby serve the glory of God,
evidence the sincerity of their faith, and express their sympathy with
their brethren in affliction. The body must be kept under and brought
into subjection. Nature is content with a little, grace with less, but
lust with nothing. It is good to stint ourselves of choice, that we may
the better bear it if ever we should come to be stinted by necessity.
And in times of public distress and calamity it ill becomes us to make
much of ourselves, as those that drank wine in bowls and were not
grieved for the affliction of Joseph, [Amo
6:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#004.md).

3\. For the dressing of it, he must bake it with a man's dung ([Eze
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#012).md); that must be dried, and serve
for fuel to heat his oven with. The thought of it would almost turn
one's stomach; yet the coarse bread, thus baked, he must eat as
barley-cakes, as freely as if it were the same bread he had been used
to. This nauseous piece of cookery he must exercise publicly in their
sight, that they might be the more affected with the calamity
approaching, which was signified by it, that in the extremity of the
famine they should not only have nothing that was dainty, but nothing
that was cleanly, about them; they must take up with what they could
get. To the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. This circumstance
of the sign, the baking of his bread with man's dung, the prophet with
submission humbly desired might be dispensed with ([Eze
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#014).md); it seemed to have in it
something of a ceremonial pollution, for there was a law that man's dung
should be covered with earth, that God might see no unclean thing in
their camp, [Deu 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#013.md), [Deu
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#014.md). And must he go and gather a
thing so offensive, and use it in the dressing of his meat in the sight
of the people? "Ah! Lord God," says he, "behold, my soul has not been
polluted, and I am afraid lest by this it be polluted." Note, The
pollution of the soul by sin is what good people dread more than any
thing; and yet sometimes tender consciences fear it without cause, and
perplex themselves with scruples about lawful things, as the prophet
here, who had not yet learned that it is not that which goes into the
mouth that defiles the man, [Mat
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#011.md). But observe he does not plead,
"Lord, from my youth I have been brought up delicately and have never
been used to any thing but what was clean and nice" (and there were
those who were so brought up, who in the siege of Jerusalem did embrace
dunghills, [Lam 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#005).md), but that he had
been brought up conscientiously, and had never eaten any thing that was
forbidden by the law, that died of itself or was torn in pieces; and
therefore, "Lord, do not put this upon me now." Thus Peter pleaded ([Act
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#014).md), Lord, I have never eaten any
thing that is common or unclean. Note, it will be comfortable to us,
when we are reduced to hardships, if our hearts can witness for us that
we have always been careful to abstain from sin, even from little sins,
and the appearances of evil. Whatever God commands us, we may be sure,
is good; but, if we be put upon any thing that we apprehend to be evil,
we should argue against it, from this consideration, that hitherto we
have preserved our purity - and shall we lose it now? Now, because
Ezekiel with a manifest tenderness of conscience made this scruple, God
dispensed with him in this matter. Note, Those who have power in their
hands should not be rigorous in pressing their commands upon those that
are dissatisfied concerning them, yea, though their dissatisfactions be
groundless or arising from education and long usage, but should recede
from them rather than grieve or offend the weak, or put a
stumbling-block before them, in conformity to the example of God's
condescension to Ezekiel, though we are sure his authority is
incontestable and all his commands are wise and good. God allowed
Ezekiel to use cow's dung instead of man's dung, [Eze
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#015.md). This is a tacit reflection upon
man, as intimating that he being polluted with sin his filthiness is
more nauseous and odious than that of any other creature. How much more
abominable and filthy is man! [Job
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#016.md).

II\. Now this sign is particularly explained here; it signified,

1\. That those who remained in Jerusalem should be brought to extreme
misery for want of necessary food. All supplies being cut off by the
besiegers, the city would soon find the want of the country, for the
king himself is served of the field; and thus the staff of bread would
be broken in Jerusalem, [Eze 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#016.md). God
would not only take away from the bread its power to nourish, so that
they should eat and not be satisfied ([Lev
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#026).md), but would take away the bread
itself ([Isa 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001).md), so that what little
remained should be eaten by weight, so much a day, so much a head, that
they might have an equal share and might make it last as long as
possible. But to what purpose, when they could not make it last always,
and the besieged must be tired out before the besiegers? They should eat
and drink with care, to make it go as far as might be, and with
astonishment, when they saw it almost spent and knew not which way to
look for a recruit. They should be astonished one with another; whereas
it is ordinarily some alleviation of a calamity to have others share
with us in it (Solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris), and some ease
to the spirit to complain of the burden, it should be an aggravation of
the misery that it was universal, and their complaining to one another
should but make them all the more uneasy and increase the astonishment.
And the event shall be as bad as their fears; they cannot make it worse
than it is, for they shall consume away for their iniquity; multitudes
of them shall die of famine, a lingering death, worse than that by the
sword ([Lam 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#009).md); they shall dies so
as to feel themselves die. And it is sin that brings all this misery
upon them: They shall consume away in their iniquity (so it may be
read); they shall continue hardened and impenitent, and shall die in
their sins, which is more miserable than to die on a dunghill. Now, (1.)
Let us see here what woeful work sin makes with a people, and
acknowledge the righteousness of God herein. Time was when Jerusalem was
filled with the finest of the wheat ([Psa
147:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#014).md); but now it would be glad of
the coarsest, and cannot have it. Fulness of bread, as it was one of
Jerusalem's mercies, so it had become one of her sins, [Eze
16:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#049.md). The plenty was abused to luxury
and excess, which were therefore thus justly punished with famine. It is
a righteous thing with God to deprive us of those enjoyments which we
have made the food and fuel of our lusts. (2.) Let us see what reason we
have to bless God for plenty, not only for the fruits of the earth, but
for the freedom of commerce, that the husbandman can have money for his
bread and the tradesman bread for his money, that there is abundance not
only in the field, but in the market, that those who live in cities and
great towns, though they sow not, neither do they reap, are yet fed from
day to day with food convenient.

2\. It signified that those who were carried into captivity should be
forced to eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles ([Eze
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#013).md), to eat meat made up by Gentile
hands otherwise than according to the law of the Jewish church, which
they were always taught to call defiled, and which they would have as
great an aversion to as a man would have to bread prepared with dung,
that is (as perhaps it may be understood) kneaded and moulded with dung.
Daniel and his fellows confined themselves to pulse and water, rather
than they would eat the portion of the king's meat assigned them,
because they apprehended it would defile them, [Dan
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#008.md). Or they should be forced to eat
putrid meat, such as their oppressors would allow them in their slavery,
and such as formerly they would have scorned to touch. Because they
served not God with cheerfulness in the abundance of all things, God
will make them serve their enemies in the want of all things.
