### [Isaiah Chapter 57](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 57:0</span></span>

The prophet, in this chapter, makes his observations, I. Upon the deaths
of good men, comforting those that were taken away in their integrity
and reproving those that did not make a due improvement of such
providences ([Isa 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001.md), [Isa
57:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#002).md). II. Upon the gross idolatries
and spiritual whoredoms which the Jews were guilty of, and the
destroying judgments they were thereby bringing upon themselves ([Isa
57:3-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#003).md). III. Upon the gracious
returns of God to his people to put an end to their captivity and
re-establish their prosperity ([Isa
57:13-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#013).md).

[Isaiah 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 57:1</span></span>

The prophet, in the close of the foregoing chapter, had condemned the
watchmen for their ignorance and sottishness; here he shows the general
stupidity and senselessness of the people likewise. No wonder they were
inconsiderate when their watchmen were so, who should have awakened them
to consideration. We may observe here,

I. The providence of God removing good men apace out of this world. The
righteous, as to this world, perish; they are gone and their place knows
them no more. Piety exempts none from the arrests of death, nay, in
persecuting times, the most righteous are most exposed to the violences
of bloody men. The first that died died a martyr. Righteousness delivers
from the sting of death, but not from the stroke of it. They are said to
perish because they are utterly removed from us, and to express the
great loss which this world sustains by the removal of them, not that
their death is their undoing, but it often proves an undoing to the
places where they lived and were useful. Nay, even merciful men are
taken away, those good men that are distinguished from the righteous,
for whom some would even dare to die, [Rom
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#007.md). Those are often removed that
could be worst spared; the fruitful trees are cut down by death and the
barren left still to cumber the ground. Merciful men are often taken
away by the hands of men's malice. Many good works they have done, and
for some of them they are stoned. Before the captivity in Babylon
perhaps there was a more than ordinary mortality of good men, so that
there were scarcely any left, [Jer
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001.md). The godly ceased, and the
faithful failed, [Psa 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#001.md).

II\. The careless world slighting these providences, and disregarding
them: No man lays it to heart, none considers it. There are very few
that lament it as a public loss, very few that take notice of it as a
public warning. The death of good men is a thing to be laid to heart and
considered more than common deaths. Serious enquiries ought to be made,
wherefore God contends with us, what good lessons are to be learned by
such providences, what we may do to help to make up the breach and to
fill up the room of those that are removed. God is justly displeased
when such events are not laid to heart, when the voice of the rod is not
heard nor the intentions of it answered, much more when it is rejoiced
in, as the slaying of the witnesses is, [Rev
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#010.md). Some of God's choicest
blessings to mankind, being thus easily parted with, are really
undervalued; and it is an evidence of very great incogitancy. Little
children, when they are little, least lament the death of their parents,
because they know not what a loss it is to them.

III\. The happiness of the righteous in their removal.

1\. They are taken away from the evil to come, then when it is just
coming, (1.) In compassion to them, that they may not see the evil ([Kg2
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#020).md), nor share in it, nor be in
temptation by it. When the deluge is coming they are called into the
ark, and have a hiding-place and rest in heaven when there was none for
them under heaven. (2.) In wrath to the world, to punish them for all
the injuries they have done to the righteous and merciful ones; those
are taken away that stood in the gap to turn away the judgments of God,
and then what can be expected but a deluge of them? It is a sign that
God intends war when he calls home his ambassadors.

2\. They go to be easy out of the reach of that evil. The righteous man,
who while he lived walked in his uprightness, when he dies enters into
peace and rests in his bed. Note, (1.) Death is gain, and rest, and
bliss, to those only who walked in their uprightness, and who, when they
die, can appeal to God concerning it, as Hezekiah ([Kg2
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#003)). Now, Lord, remember it. (2..md)
Those that practised uprightness, and persevered in it to the end, shall
find it well with them when they die. Their souls then enter into peace,
into the world of peace, where peace is in perfection and where there is
no trouble. Enter thou into the joy of the Lord. Their bodies rest in
their beds. Note, The grave is a bed of rest to all the Lord's people;
there they rest from all their labours, [Rev
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013.md). And the more weary they were
the more welcome will that rest be to them, [Job
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#017.md). This bed is made in the
darkness, but that makes it the more quiet; it is a bed out of which
they shall rise refreshed in the morning of the resurrection.

[Isaiah 57:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 57:3</span></span>

We have here a high charge, but a just one no doubt, drawn up against
that wicked generation out of which God's righteous ones were removed,
because the world was not worthy of them. Observe,

I. The general character here given of them, or the name and title by
which they stand indicted, [Isa 57:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#003.md).
They are told to draw near and hear the charge, are set to the bar, and
arraigned there as sons of the sorceress, or of a witch, the seed of an
adulterer and a whore, that is, they were such themselves, they were
strongly inclined to be such, and their ancestors were such before them.
Sin is sorcery and adultery, for it is departing from God and dealing
with the devil. They were children of disobedience. "Come," says the
prophet, "draw near hither, and I will read you your doom; to the
righteous death will bring peace and rest, but not to you; you are
children of transgression and a seed of falsehood ([Isa
57:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#004).md), that have it by kind, and have
it woven into your very nature, to backslide from God and to deal
treacherously with him," [Isa 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#008.md).

II\. The particular crimes laid to their charge.

1\. Scoffing at God and his word. They were a generation of scorners
([Isa 57:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#004).md): "Against whom do you
sport yourselves? You think it is only against the poor prophets whom
you trample upon as contemptible men, but really it is against God
himself, who sends them, and whose message they deliver." Mocking the
messengers of the Lord was Jerusalem's measure-filling sin, for what was
done to them God took as done to himself. When they were reproved for
their sins, and threatened with the judgments of God, they ridiculed the
word of God with the rudest and most indecent gestures and expressions
of disdain. They sported themselves, and made themselves merry, with
that which should have made them serious, and under which they should
have humbled themselves. They made wry mouths at the prophets, and drew
out the tongue, contrary to all the laws of good breeding; nor did they
treat God's prophets with the common civility with which they would have
treated a gentleman's servant that had been sent to them on an errand.
Note, Those who mock at God, and bid defiance to his judgments, had best
consider who it is towards whom they conduct themselves so insolently.

2\. Idolatry. This was that sin which the people of the Jews were most
notoriously guilty of before the captivity; but that affliction cured
them of it. In Isaiah's time it abounded, witness the abominable
idolatries of Ahaz (which some think are particularly referred to here)
and of Manasseh. (1.) They were dotingly fond of their idols, were
inflamed with them, as those that burn in unlawful unnatural lusts, [Rom
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#027.md). They were mad upon their idols,
[Jer 50:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#038.md). They inflamed themselves
with them by their violent passions in the worship of them, as those of
Baal's prophets that leaped upon the altar, and cut themselves, [Kg1
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#026.md), [Kg1
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#028.md). Note, Vile corruptions, the
more they are gratified the more they are inflamed. They worshipped
their idols under every green tree, in the open air, and in the shade;
yet that did not cool the heat of their impetuous lusts, but rather the
charming beauty of the green trees made them the more fond of their
idols which they worshipped there. Thus that in nature which is
pleasing, instead of drawing them to the God of nature, drew them from
him. The flame of their zeal in the worship of false gods may shame us
for our coldness and indifference in the worship of the true God. They
strove to inflame themselves, but we distract and deaden ourselves. (2.)
They were barbarous and unnaturally cruel in the worship of their idols.
They slew their children, and offered them in sacrifice to their idols,
not only in the valley of the son of Hinnom, the headquarters of that
monstrous idolatry, but in other valleys, in imitation of that, and
under the cliffs of the rock, in dark and solitary places, the fittest
for such works of darkness. (3.) They were abundant and insatiable in
their idolatries. They never thought they could have idols enough, nor
could spend enough upon them and do enough in their service. The Syrians
had once a notion of the God of Israel that he was a God of the hills,
but not a God of the valleys ([Kg1
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#028).md); but these idolaters, to make
sure work, had both. \[1.\] They had gods of the valleys, which they
worshipped in the low places by the water side ([Isa
57:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#006).md): Among the smooth stones of the
valley, or brook, is thy portion. If they saw a smooth carved stone,
though set up but for a way-mark or a mere-stone, they were ready to
worship it, as the papists do crosses. Or in stony valleys they set up
their gods, which they called their portion, and took for their lot, as
God's people take him for their lot and portion. But these gods of stone
would really be no better a portion for them, no better a lot, than the
smooth stones of the stream near which they were set up, for sometimes
they worshipped their rivers. "They, they, are the lot which thou
trustest to and art pleased with, but thou shalt be put off with it for
thy lot, and miserable will thy case be." See the folly of sinners, who
take the smooth stones of the stream for their portion, when they might
have the precious stones of God's Jerusalem, and the high priest's
ephod, to portion themselves with. Having taken these idols for their
lot and portion, they stick at no charge in doing honour to them: "To
them hast thou poured a drink-offering, and offered a meat-offering, as
if they had given thee thy meat and drink." They loved their idols
better than their children, for their own tables must be robbed to
replenish the altars of their idols. Have we taken the true God for our
portion? Is he, even he, our lot? Let us then serve him with our meat
and drink, not, as they did, by depriving ourselves of the use of them,
but by eating and drinking to his glory. Here, in a parenthesis, comes
in an expression of God's just resentment of this wickedness of theirs:
Should I receive comfort in these - in such a people as this? Can those
expect that God will take any pleasure in them, or accept their
devotions at his altar, who thus serve Baal with the gifts of his
providence? God takes comfort in his people, while they are faithful to
him; but what comfort can he take in them when those that should be his
witnesses against the idolatries of the world do themselves fall in with
them? Should I have compassion on these? (so some), or should I repent
me concerning these? so others. "How can they expect that I should spare
them, and either adjourn or abate their punishment, when they are so
very provoking? Shall I not visit for these things?" [Jer
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#007.md), [Jer
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#009.md). \[2.\] They had gods of the hills
too ([Isa 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#007).md): "Upon a lofty and
high mountain (as if thou wouldst vie with the high and lofty One
himself, [Isa 57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015).md) hast thou set thy
bed, thy idol, thy idol's temple and altar, the bed of thy uncleanness,
where thou committest spiritual whoredom, with all the wantonness of an
idolatrous fancy, and in direct violation of the covenant of thy God.
Thither wentest thou up readily enough, though it was up-hill, to offer
sacrifice." Some think this bespeaks the impudence they arrived at in
their idolatries; at first they had some sense of shame, when they
worshipped their idols in the valleys, in obscure places; but they soon
conquered that, and came to do it upon the lofty high mountains. They
were not ashamed, neither could they blush. \[3.\] As if these were not
enough, they had household-gods too, their lares and penates. Behind the
doors and the posts ([Isa 57:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#008).md), where
the law of God should be written for a memorandum to them of their duty,
they set up the remembrance of their idols, not so much to keep up their
own remembrance of them (they were so fond of them that they could not
forget them), but to show to others how mindful they were of them, and
to put their children in mind of them, and possess them betimes with a
veneration for these dunghill deities. \[4.\] As they were insatiable in
their idolatries, so they were inseparable from them. They were hardened
in their wickedness; they worshipped their idols openly and in public
view, as being neither ashamed of the sin nor afraid of the punishment;
they went as publicly, and in as great crowds, to the idol-temples, as
ever they had gone to God's house. This was like an impudent harlot,
discovering themselves to another than God, making profession of another
than the true religion. They took a pride in making proselytes to their
idolatries, and not only went up themselves to their high places, but
enlarged their bed, that is, their idol-temples, and (as the margin
reads the following words) thou hewedst it for thyself larger than
theirs, than theirs from whom thou copiedst it, and tookest the platform
of it, as Ahaz of his altar from that which he saw at Damascus, [Kg2
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010.md). And being thus involved over
head and ears, as it were, in their idolatries, there is no parting them
from them. Ephraim is now joined to idols both in love and league.
First, In league: "Thou hast made a covenant with them, with the idols,
with the idol-worshippers, to live and die together." This was a
complete renunciation of their covenant with God and an avowed
resolution to persist in their apostasy from him. Secondly, In love:
"Thou lovedst their bed, that is, the temple of an idol, wherever thou
sawest it." Justly therefore were they given up to their own hearts'
lusts.

3\. Another sin charged upon them is their trusting in and seeking to
foreign aids and succours, and contracting a communion with the Gentile
powers ([Isa 57:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#009).md): Thou wentest to
the king, which some understand of the idol they worshipped,
particularly Moloch, which signifies a king. "Thou didst every thing to
ingratiate thyself with those idols, didst offer incense and sweet
ointments at their altars." Or it may be meant of the king of Assyria,
whom Ahaz made his court to, or of the king of Babylon, whose
ambassadors Hezekiah caressed, or of other kings of the nations whose
idolatrous usages they admired and were desirous to learn and imitate,
and for that end went and sent to cultivate an acquaintance and
correspondence with them, that they might be like them and strengthen
themselves by an alliance with them. See here, (1.) What an expense they
were at in forming and procuring this grand alliance. They went with
ointments and perfumes, either bestowed upon themselves, to beautify
their own faces and so make themselves considerable and worthy the
friendship of the greatest king, or to be presented to those whose
favour they were ambitious of, because a man's gift makes room for him
and brings him before great men. "When the first present of rich
perfumes was thought too little, thou didst increase them;" and thus
many seek the ruler's favour, forgetting that, after all, every man's
judgment proceeds from the Lord. So fond were they of those heathen
princes that they not only went themselves, in all their airs, to those
that were near them, but sent messengers to those that were afar off,
[Isa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002). (2..md) How much they hereby
disparaged themselves and laid the honour of their crown and nation in
the dust: Thou didst debase thyself even unto hell. They did so by their
idolatries. It is a dishonour to the children of men, who are endued
with the powers of reason, to worship that as their god which is the
creature of their own fancy and the work of their own hands, to bow down
to the stock of a tree. It is much more a dishonour to the children of
God, who are blessed with the privilege of divine revelation, to forsake
such a God as they know theirs to be for a thing of nought, their own
mercies for lying vanities. They likewise debased themselves by
truckling to their heathen neighbours, and depending upon them, when
they had a God to go to who is all-sufficient and in covenant with them.
How did those shame themselves to the highest degree, and sink
themselves to the lowest, that forsook the fountain of life for broken
cisterns and the rock of ages for broken reeds! Note, Sinners disparage
and debase themselves; the service of sin is an ignominious slavery; and
those who thus debase themselves to hell will justly have their portion
there.

III\. The aggravations of their sin. 1. They had been tired with
disappointments in their wicked courses, and yet they would not be
convinced of the folly of them ([Isa
57:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#010).md): "Thou art wearied in the
greatness of thy way; thou hast undertaken a mighty task, to find out
true satisfaction and happiness in that which is vanity and a lie."
Those that set up idols, instead of God, for the object of their
worship, and princes, instead of God, for the object of their hope and
confidence, and think thus to better themselves and make themselves
easy, go a great way about, and will never come to their journey's end:
Thou art wearied in the multitude, or multiplicity, of thy ways (so some
read it): those that forsake the only right way wander endlessly in a
thousand by-paths, and lose themselves in the many inventions which they
have sought out. They weary themselves with fresh chases and fierce
ones, but never gain their point, like the Sodomites, that wearied
themselves to find the door ([Gen
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#011).md) and could not find it at last.
The pleasures of sin will soon surfeit, but never satisfy; a man may
quickly tire himself in the pursuit of them, but can never repose
himself in the enjoyment of them. They found this by experience. The
idols they had often worshipped never did them any kindness; the kings
they courted distressed them, and helped them not; and yet they were so
wretchedly besotted that they could not say, "There is no hope; it is in
vain any longer to expect that satisfaction in creature-confidences, and
in the worship of idols, which we have so often looked for, and never
met with." Note, Despair of happiness in the creature, and of
satisfaction in the service of sin, is the first step towards a
well-grounded hope of happiness in God and a well-fixed resolution to
keep to his service; and those are inexcusable who have had sensible
convictions of the vanity of the creature, and yet will not be brought
to say, "There is no hope to be happy short of the Creator." 2. Though
they were convinced that the way they were in was a sinful way, yet,
because they had found some present sensual pleasure and worldly profit
by it, they could not persuade themselves to be sorry for it: "Thou hast
found the life of thy hand" (or the living of it); thou boastest how
fortune smiles upon thee, and therefore thou art not grieved, any more
than Ephraim when he said ([Hos 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#008).md),
"I have become rich; I have found out substance." Note, Prosperity in
sin is a great bar to conversion from sin. Those that live at ease in
their sinful projects, are tempted to think God favours them, and
therefore they have nothing to repent of. Some read it ironically, or by
way of question: "Thou hast found the life of thy hand, hast found true
satisfaction and happiness, no doubt thou hast; hast thou not? And
therefore thou art so far from being grieved that thou blessest thyself
in thy own evil way; but review thy gains once more, and come to a
balance of profit and loss, and then say, What fruit hast thou of those
things whereof thou art ashamed and for which God shall bring thee into
judgment?" [Rom 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#021.md). 3. They had
dealt very unworthily with God by their sin; for, (1.) It should seem
they pretended that the reason why they left God was because he was too
terrible a majesty for them to deal with; they must have gods that they
could be more free and familiar with. "But," says God, "of whom hast
thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, that thou hast dealt
falsely and treacherously with me, and dissembled in thy covenants with
me and prayers to me? What did I ever do to frighten thee from me? What
occasion have I given thee to think hardly of me, that thou hast gone to
seek a kinder master?" (2.) However, it is certain that they had no true
reverence of God nor any serious regard to him. So that question is
commonly understood, "Of whom hast thou been afraid, or feared? Of none;
for thou hast not feared me whom thou shouldst fear; for thou hast lied
to me." Those that dissemble with God make it to appear they stand in no
awe of him. "Thou hast not remembered me, neither what I have said nor
what I have done, neither the promises nor the threatenings, nor the
performances of either; thou hast not laid them to thy heart, as thou
wouldst have done if thou hadst feared me." Note, Those who lay not the
word of God and his providences to their hearts do thereby show that
they have not the fear of God before their eyes. And multitudes are
ruined by fearlessness, forgetfulness, and mere carelessness; they do
not aright nor to good purpose fear any thing, remember any thing, nor
lay any thing to heart. Nay, (3.) They were hardened in their sin by the
patience and forbearance of God. "Have not I held my peace of old, and
for a long time? These things thou hast done and I kept silence. And
therefore, as it follows here, thou fearest me not;" as if because God
had spared long he would never punish, [Ecc
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011.md). Because he kept silence the
sinner thought him altogether such a one as himself, and stood in no awe
of him.

IV\. Here is God's resolution to call them to an account, though he had
long borne with them ([Isa 57:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#012).md): "I
will declare (like that, [Psa 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021.md),
But I will reprove thee), I will declare thy righteousness, which thou
makest thy boast of, and let the world see, and thyself too, to thy
confusion, that it is all a sham, all a cheat, it is not what it
pretends to be. When thy righteousness comes to be examined it will be
found that it was unrighteousness, and that there was no sincerity in
all thy pretensions. I will declare thy works, what they have been and
what the gain thou pretendest to have gotten by them, and it will appear
that at long-run they shall not profit thee, nor turn to any account."
Note, Sinful works, as they are works of darkness, and there is no
reason nor righteousness in them, so they are unfruitful works and there
is nothing got by them; and, however they look now, it will be made to
appear so another day. Sin profits not, nay, it ruins and destroys.

[Isaiah 57:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 57:13</span></span>

Here, I. God shows how insufficient idols and creatures were to relieve
and succour those that worshipped them and confided in them ([Isa
57:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#013).md): "When thou criest in thy
distress and anguish, lamentest thy misery and callest for help, let thy
companies deliver thee, thy idol-gods which thou hast heaped to thyself
companies of, the troops of the confederate forces which thou hast
relied so much upon, let them deliver thee if they can; expect no other
relief than what they can give." Thus God said to Israel, when in their
trouble they called upon him ([Jdg
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#014).md), Go, and cry to the gods which
you have chosen, let them deliver you. But in vain is salvation hoped
for from them: The wind shall carry them all away, the wind of God's
wrath, that breath of his mouth which shall slay the wicked; they have
made themselves as chaff, and therefore the wind will of course hurry
them away. Vanity they are, and vanity shall take them away, to vanity
they shall be reduced, and vanity shall be their recompence. Both the
idols and their worshippers shall come to nothing.

II\. He shows that there was a sufficiency, an all-sufficiency, in him
for the comfort and deliverance of all those that put their confidence
in him and made their application to him. Their safety and satisfaction
appear the more comfortable because their hopes are crowned with
fruition, when those that seek to other helpers have their hopes
frustrated: "He that puts his trust in me, and in me only, he shall be
happy, both for soul and body, for this world and the other."

1\. Observe, in general, (1.) Those that trust in God's providence take
the best course to secure their secular interests. They shall possess
the land, as much of it as is good for them, and what they have they
shall have it from a good hand and hold it by a good title. [Psa
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#003.md), They shall dwell in the land,
and verily they shall be fed. (2.) Those that trust in God's grace take
the best course to secure their sacred interests. They shall inherit my
holy mountain. They shall enjoy the privileges of the church on earth,
and be brought at length to the joys of heaven; and no wind shall carry
them away.

2\. More particularly,

(1.) The captives, that trust in God, shall be released ([Isa
57:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#014).md): They shall say (that is, the
messengers of his providence, in that great event shall say), Cast you
up, cast you up, prepare the way. When God's time shall have come for
their deliverance the way of bringing it about shall be made plain and
easy, obstacles shall be removed, difficulties that seemed insuperable
shall be speedily got over, and all things shall concur both to
accelerate and facilitate their return. See [Isa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md), [Isa
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#004.md). This refers to the provision
which the gospel, and the grace of it, have made for our ready passage
through this world to a better. The way of religion is now cast up; it
is a highway; ministers' business is to direct people in it, and to help
them over the discouragements they meet with, that nothing may offend
them.

(2.) The contrite, that trust in God, shall be revived, [Isa
57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015.md). Those that trusted to idols and
creatures for help went with their ointments and perfumes ([Isa
57:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#009).md); but here God shows that those
who may expect help from him are such as are destitute of, and set
themselves at a distance from, the gaieties of the world and the
delights of sense. God's glory appears here very bright, \[1.\] In his
greatness and majesty: He is the high and lofty One that inhabits
eternity. Let this inspire us with very high and honourable thoughts of
the God with whom we have to do, First, That his being and perfections
are exalted infinitely above every creature, not only above what they
have themselves, but above what they can conceive concerning him, far
above all their blessing and praise, [Neh
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#005.md). He is the high and lofty One, and
there is no creature like him, nor any to be compared with him. The
language likewise intimates his sovereign dominion over all and the
incontestable right he has to give both law and judgment to all. He is
higher than the highest ([Ecc 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008).md),
than the highest heavens, [Psa 113:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#004.md).
Secondly, That with him there is neither beginning of days nor end of
life, nor change of time; he is both immortal and immutable. He only has
immortality, [Ti1 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016.md). He has it of
himself, and he has it constantly; he inhabits it, and cannot be
dispossessed of it. We must shortly remove into eternity, but God always
inhabits it. Thirdly, That there is an infinite rectitude in his nature,
and an exact conformity with himself and a steady design of his own
glory in all that he does; and this appears in every thing by which he
has made himself known, for his name is holy, and all that desire to be
acquainted with him must know him as a holy God. Fourthly, That the
peculiar residence and manifestation of his glory are in the mansions of
light and bliss above: "I dwell in the high and holy place, and will
have all the world to know it." Whoever have any business with God must
direct to him as their Father in heaven, for there he dwells. These
great things are here said of God to inspire us with a holy reverence of
him, to encourage our confidence in him, and to magnify his compassion
and condescension to us, that though he is thus high yet he has respect
unto the lowly; he that rides on the heavens by his name JAH stoops to
concern himself for poor widows and fatherless, [Psa
68:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#004.md), [Psa
68:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#005.md). \[2.\] In his grace and mercy.
He has a tender pity for the humble and contrite, for those that are so
in respect of their state. If they be his people, he will not overlook
them though they are poor and low in the world, and despised and
trampled upon by men; but he here refers to the temper of their mind; he
will have a tender regard to those who, being in affliction, accommodate
themselves to their affliction, and bring their mind to their condition,
be it ever so low and ever so sad and sorely broken - those that are
truly penitent for sin, who mourn in secret for it, and have a dread of
the wrath of God, which they have made themselves obnoxious to, and are
submissive under all his rebukes. Now, First, With these God will dwell.
He will visit them graciously, will converse familiarly with them by his
word and Spirit, as a man does with those of his own family; he will be
always nigh to them and present with them. He that dwells in the highest
heavens dwells in the lowest hearts and inhabits sincerity as surely as
he inhabits eternity. In these he delights. Secondly, He will revive
their heart and spirit, will speak that to them, and work that in them
by the word and Spirit of his grace, which will be reviving to them, as
a cordial to one that is ready to faint. He will give them reviving joys
and hopes sufficient to counterbalance all the griefs and fears that
break their spirits. He dwells with them, and his presence is reviving.

(3.) Those with whom he contends, if they trust in him, shall be
relieved, and received into favour, [Isa
57:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#016.md). He will revive the heart of the
contrite ones, for he will not contend for ever. Nothing makes a soul
contrite so much as God's contending, and therefore nothing revives it
so much as his ceasing his controversy. Here is, \[1.\] A gracious
promise. It is not promised that he will never be angry with his people,
for their sins are displeasing to him, or that he will never contend
with them, for they must expect the rod; but he will not contend for
ever, nor be always wroth. As he is not soon angry, so he is not long
angry. He will not always chide. Though he contend with them by
convictions of sin, he will not contend for ever; but, instead of the
spirit of bondage, they shall receive the Spirit of adoption. He has
torn, but he will heal. Though eh contend with them by the rebukes of
providence, yet the correction shall not last always, shall not last
long, shall last no longer than there is need ([Pe1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006).md), no longer than they can bear, no
longer than till it has done its work. Though their whole life be
calamitous, yet their end will be peace, and so will their eternity be.
\[2.\] A very compassionate consideration, upon which this promise is
grounded: "If I should contend for ever, the spirit would fail before
me, ever the souls which I have made." Note, First, God is the Father of
spirits, [Heb 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#009.md). Those with whom he
will not always contend are the souls that he has made, that he gave
being to by creation and a new being to by regeneration. Secondly,
Though the Lord is for the body, yet he concerns himself chiefly for the
souls of his people, that the spirit do not fail, and its graces and
comforts. Thirdly, When troubles last long, the spirit even of good men
is apt to fail. They are tempted to entertain hard thoughts of God, to
think it in vain to serve him; they are ready to put comfort away from
them, and to despair of relief, and then the spirit fails. Fourthly, It
is in consideration of this that God will not contend for ever; for he
will not forsake the work of his own hands nor defeat the purchase of
his Son's blood. The reason is taken not from our merit, but from our
weakness and infirmity; for he remembers that we are flesh ([Psa
78:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#039).md) and that flesh is weak.

[Isaiah 57:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 57:17</span></span>

The body of the people of Israel, in this account of God's dealings with
them, is spoken of as a particular person ([Isa
57:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#017.md), [Isa
57:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#018).md), but divided into two sorts,
differently dealt with - some who were sons of peace, to whom peace is
spoken ([Isa 57:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019).md), and others who
were not, who have nothing to do with peace, [Isa
57:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#020.md), [Isa
57:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#021.md). Observe here,

I. The just rebukes which that people were brought under for their sin:
For the iniquity of his covetousness I was wroth, and smote him.
Covetousness was a sin that abounded very much among that people. [Jer
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#013.md), From the least to the greatest
of them, every one is given to covetousness. Those that did not worship
images were yet carried away by this spiritual idolatry: for such is
covetousness; it is making money the god, [Col
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005.md). No marvel that the people were
covetous when their watchmen themselves were notoriously so, [Isa
56:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#011.md), Yet, covetous as they were, in
the service of their idols they were prodigal, [Isa
57:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#006.md). And it is hard to say whether
their profuseness in that or their covetousness in every thing else was
more provoking. But for this iniquity, among others, God was angry with
them, and brought one judgment after another upon them, and their
destruction at last by the Chaldeans. 1. God was wroth. He resented it,
took it very ill that a people who were devoted to himself, and
portioned in himself, should be so entirely given up to the world and
choose that for their portion. Note, Covetousness is an iniquity that is
very displeasing to the God of heaven. It is a heart-sin, but he sees
it, and therefore hates it, and looks upon it with jealousy, because it
sets up a rival with him in the soul. It is a sin which men bless
themselves in ([Psa 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#018).md) and in
which their neighbours bless them ([Psa
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#003).md); but God abhors it. 2. He motes
him, reproved him for it by his prophets, corrected him by his
providence, punished him in those very things he so doted upon and was
covetous of. Note, Sinners shall be made to feel from the anger of God.
Those whom he is wroth with he smites; and covetousness particularly
lays men under the tokens of God's displeasure. Those that set their
hearts upon the wealth of this world are disappointed of it or it is
embittered to them; it is either clogged with a cross or turned into a
curse. 3. God hid himself from him when he was under these rebukes, and
continued wroth with him. When we are under the rod, if God manifest
himself to us, we may bear it the better; but if he both smite us and
hide himself from us, send us no prophets, speak to us no comfortable
word, show us no token for good, if he tear and go away ([Hos
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#014).md), we are very miserable.

II\. Their obstinacy and incorrigibleness under these rebukes: He went
on frowardly in the way of his heart, in his evil way. He was not
sensible of the displeasure of God that he was under. He felt the smart
of the rod, but had no regard at all to the hand; the more he was
crossed in his worldly pursuits the more eager he was in them. He either
would not see his error or if he saw it would not amend it. Covetousness
was the way of his heart; it was what he was inclined to and intent
upon, and he would not be reclaimed, but in his distress he trespassed
yet more, [Ch2 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#022.md). See the strength
of the corruption of men's hearts, and the sinfulness of sin, which will
take its course in despite of God himself and all the flames of his
wrath. See also how insufficient afflictions of themselves are to reform
men, unless God's grace work with them.

III\. God's wonderful return in mercy to them, notwithstanding the
obstinacy of the generality of them.

1\. The greater part of them went on frowardly, but there were some
among them that were mourners for the obstinacy of the rest; and with an
eye to them, or rather for his own name's sake, God determines not to
contend for ever with them. With the froward God may justly show himself
froward ([Psa 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026).md), and walk
contrary to those that walk contrary to him, [Lev
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#024.md). When this sinner here went on
frowardly in the way of his heart, one would think it should have
followed, "I have seen his ways and will destroy him, will abandon him,
will never have any thing more to do with him." But such are the riches
of divine mercy and grace, and so do they rejoice against judgment, that
it follows, I have seen his ways and will heal him. See how God's
goodness takes occasion from man's badness to appear so much the more
illustrious; and where sin has abounded grace much more abounds. God's
reasons of mercy are fetched from within himself, for in us there
appears nothing but what is provoking: "I have seen his ways, and yet I
will heal him for my own name's sake." God knew how bad the people were,
and yet would not cast them off. But observe the method. God will first
give him grace, and then, and not till then, give him peace: "I have
seen his way, that he will never turn to me of himself, and therefore I
will turn him." Those whom God has mercy in store for he has grace in
readiness for, to prepare and qualify them for that mercy which they
were running from as fast as they could. (1.) God will heal him of his
corrupt and vicious disposition, will cure him of his covetousness,
though it be ever so deeply rooted in him and his heart have been long
exercised to covetous practices. There is no spiritual disease so
inveterate, but almighty grace can conquer it. (2.) God will lead him
also; not only amend what was amiss in him, that he may cease to do
evil, but direct him into the way of duty, that he may learn to do well.
He goes on frowardly, as Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and
slaughter, but God will lead him into a better mind, a better path. And
them, (3.) He will restore those comforts to him which he had forfeited
and lost, and for the return of which he had thus prepared him. There
was a wonderful reformation wrought upon captives in Babylon, and then a
wonderful redemption wrought for them, which brought comfort to them, to
their mourners, to those among them that mourned for their own sins, the
sins of their people, and the desolations of the sanctuary. To those
mourners the mercy would be most comfortable, and to them God had an eye
in working it out. Blessed are those that mourn, for to them comfort
belongs, and they shall have it.

2\. Now, as when that people went into captivity some of them were good
figs, very good, others of them bad figs, very bad, and accordingly
their captivity was to them for their good or for their hurt ([Jer
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#008.md), [Jer
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#009).md), so, when they came out of
captivity, still some of them were good, others bad, and the deliverance
was to them accordingly.

(1.) To those among them that were good their return out of captivity
was peace, such peace as was a type and earnest of the peace which
should be preached by Jesus Christ ([Isa
57:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019).md): I create the fruit of the
lips, peace. \[1.\] God designed to give them matter for praise and
thanksgiving, for that is the fruit of the lips ([Heb
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015).md), the calves of the lips, [Hos
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002.md). I create this. Creation is out
of nothing, and this is surely out of worse than nothing, when God
creates matter of praise for those that went on frowardly in the way of
their heart. \[2.\] In order to this, peace shall be published: Peace,
peace (perfect peace, all kinds of peace) to him that is afar off from
the general rendezvous, or from the head-quarters, as well as to him
that is near. Peace with God; though he has contended with them, he will
be reconciled and will let fall his controversy. Peace of conscience, a
holy security and serenity of mind, after the many reproaches of
conscience and agitations of spirit they had been under their captivity.
Thus God creates the fruit of the lips, fresh matter for thanksgiving;
for, when he speaks peace to us, we must speak praises to him. This
peace is itself of God's creating. He, and he only, can work it; it is
the fruit of the lips, of his lips - he commands it, of the minister's
lips - he speaks it by them, [Isa
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001.md). It is the fruit of preaching
lips and praying lips; it is the fruit of Christ's lips, whose lips drop
as a honeycomb; for to him this is applied, [Eph
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017.md) : He came and preached peace to
you who were afar off, you Gentiles as well as to the Jews, who were
nigh-to after-ages, who were afar off in time, as well as to those of
the present age.

(2.) To those among them that were wicked, though they might return with
the rest, their return was no peace, [Isa
57:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#020.md). The wicked, wherever he is, in
Babylon or in Jerusalem, carries about with him the principle of his own
uneasiness, and is like the troubled sea. God healed those to whom he
spoke peace ([Isa 57:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019).md): I will heal
them; all shall be well again and set to rights; but the wicked would
not be healed by the grace of God and therefore shall not be healed by
his comforts. They are always like the sea in a storm, for they carry
about with them, \[1.\] Unmortified corruptions. They are not cured and
conquered, and their ungoverned lusts and passions make them like the
troubled sea when it cannot rest, vexatious to all about them and
therefore uneasy to themselves, noisy and dangerous. When the
intemperate heats of the spirit break out in scurrilous and abusive
language, then the troubled sea casts forth mire and dirt. \[2.\]
Unpacified consciences. They are under a frightful apprehension of guilt
and wrath, that they cannot enjoy themselves; when they seem settled
they are in disquietude, when they seem merry they are in heaviness;
like Cain, who always dwelt in the land of shaking. The terrors of
conscience disturb all their enjoyments, and cast forth such mire and
dirt as make them a burden to themselves. Though this does not appear
(it may be) at present, yet it is a certain truth, what this prophet had
said before ([Isa 48:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#022).md), and here
repeats ([Isa 57:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#021).md), There is no
peace to the wicked, no reconciliation to God (nor can they be upon good
terms with him, while they go on still in their trespasses), no
quietness or satisfaction in their own mind, no real good, no peace in
death, because no hope. My God hath said it, and all the world cannot
unsay it, That there is no peace to those that allow themselves in any
sin. What have they to do with peace?
