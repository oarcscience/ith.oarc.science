### [Leviticus Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 24:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have, I. A repetition of the laws concerning the
lamps and the show-bread ([Lev
24:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#001).md). II. A violation of the law
against blasphemy, with the imprisonment, trial, condemnation, and
execution, of the blasphemer ([Lev
24:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#010.md), with [Lev
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#023).md). III. The law against blasphemy
reinforced ([Lev 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#015.md), [Lev
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#016).md), with sundry other laws ([Lev
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#017), etc..md).

[Leviticus 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 24:1</span></span>

Care is here taken, and orders are given, for the decent furnishing of
the candlestick and table in God's house.

I. The lamps must always be kept burning. The law for this we had
before, [Exo 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#020.md), [Exo
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#021.md). It is here repeated, probably
because it now began to be put in execution, when other things were
settled. 1. The people were to provide oil ([Lev
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#002).md), and this, as every thing else
that was to be used in God's service, must be of the best, pure
olive-oil, beaten, probably it was double-strained. This was to cause
the lamps to burn; all our English copies read it lamps, but in the
original it is singular in [Lev 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#002.md) -
to cause the lamp to burn; but plural in [Lev
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#004.md) - he shall order the lamps. The
seven lamps made all one lamp, in allusion to which the blessed Spirit
of grace is represented by seven lamps of fire before the throne ([Rev
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#005).md), for there are diversities of
gifts, but one Spirit, [Co1 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004.md).
Ministers are as burning and shining lights in Christ's church, but it
is the duty of people to provide comfortably for them, as Israel for the
lamps. Scandalous maintenance makes a scandalous ministry. 2. The
priests were to tend the lamps; they must snuff them, clean the
candlestick, and supply them with oil, morning and evening, [Lev
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#003.md), [Lev
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#004.md). Thus it is the work of the
ministers of the gospel to hold forth that word of life, not to set up
new lights, but, by expounding and preaching the word, to make the light
of it more clear and extensive. This was the ordinary way of keeping the
lamps burning; but, when the church was poor and in distress, we find
its lamps fed constantly with oil from the good olives immediately,
without the ministry of priest or people ([Zac
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#002.md), [Zac
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#003).md); for, though God has tied us to
means, he has not tied himself to them, but will take effectual care
that his lamp never go out in the world for want of oil.

II\. The table must always be kept spread. This was appointed before,
[Exo 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#030.md). And here also, 1. The
table was furnished with bread; not dainties nor varieties to gratify a
luxurious palate, but twelve loaves or cakes of bread, [Lev
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#005.md), [Lev
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#006.md). Where there is plenty of bread
there is no famine; and where bread is not there is no feast. There was
a loaf for every tribe, for in our Father's house there is bread enough.
They were all provided for by the divine bounty, and were all welcome to
the divine grace. Even after the revolt of the ten tribes this number of
loaves was continued ([Ch2 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#011).md), for
the sake of those few of each tribe that retained their affection to the
temple and continued their attendance on it. 2. A handful of
frankincense was put in a golden saucer, upon or by each row, [Lev
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#007.md). When the bread was removed, and
given to the priests, this frankincense was burnt upon the golden altar
(I suppose) over and above the daily incense: and this was for a
memorial instead of the bread, an offering made by fire, as the handful
of the meat-offering which was burnt upon the altar is called the
memorial thereof, [Lev 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#002.md). Thus a
little was accepted as a humble acknowledgment, and all the loaves were
consigned to the priests. All God's spiritual Israel, typified by the
twelve loaves, are made through Christ a sweet savour to him, and their
prayers are said to come up before God for a memorial, [Act
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#004.md). The word is borrowed from the
ceremonial law. 3. Every sabbath it was renewed. When the loaves had
stood there a week, the priests had them to eat with other holy things
that were to be eaten in the holy place ([Lev
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#009).md), and new ones were provided at
the public charge, and put in the room of them, [Lev
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#008.md). The Jews say, "The hands of
those priests that put on were mixed with theirs that took off, that the
table might be never empty, but the bread might be before the Lord
continually." God is never unprovided for the entertainment of those
that visit him, as men often are, [Luk
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#005.md). Every one of those cakes
contained two tenth-deals, that is, two omers of fine flour; just so
much manna every Israelite gathered on the sixth day for the sabbath,
[Exo 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#022.md). Hence some infer that this
show-bread, which was set on the table on the sabbath, was intended as a
memorial of the manna wherewith they were fed in the wilderness.
Christ's ministers should provide new bread for his house every sabbath
day, the production of their fresh studies in the scripture, that their
proficiency may appear to all, [Ti1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001.md), [Ti1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#005.md).

[Leviticus 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 24:10</span></span>

Evil manners, we say, beget good laws. We have here an account of the
evil manners of a certain nameless mongrel Israelite, and the good laws
occasioned thereby.

I. The offender was the son of an Egyptian father and an Israelitish
mother ([Lev 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#010).md); his mother was of
the tribe of Dan, [Lev 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#011.md). Neither
he nor his father is named, but his mother only, who was an Israelite.
This notice is taken of his parentage either, 1. To intimate what
occasioned the quarrel he was engaged in. The Jews say, "He offered to
set up his tent among the Danites in the right of his mother, but was
justly opposed by some or other of that tribe, and informed that his
father being an Egyptian he had no part nor lot in the matter, but must
look upon himself as a stranger." Or, 2. To show the common ill effect
of such mixed marriages. When a daughter of Israel would marry an
idolatrous malignant Egyptian, what could be the fruit of such a
marriage but a blasphemer? For the children will be apt to take after
the worse side, whichsoever it is, and will sooner learn of an Egyptian
father to blaspheme than of an Israelitish mother to pray and praise.

II\. The occasion of the offence was contention: He strove with a man of
Israel. The mixed multitude of Egyptians that came up with Israel ([Exo
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#038).md) were in many ways hurtful to
them, and this was one, they were often the authors of strife. The way
to preserve the peace of the church is to preserve the purity of it. In
this strife he broke out into ill language. Note, When quarrels begin we
know not what mischief they will make before they end, nor how treat a
matter a little fire may kindle. When men's passion is up they are apt
to forget both their reason and their religion, which is a good reason
why we should not be apt either to give or to resent provocation, but
leave off strife before it be meddled with, because the beginning of it
is as the letting forth of water.

III\. The offence itself was blasphemy and cursing, [Lev
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#011.md). It is supposed that his cause
came to be heard before the judges, who determined that he had no right
to the privileges of an Israelite, his father being an Egyptian, and
that, being enraged at the sentence, 1. He blasphemed the name of the
Lord. He blasphemed the name, that is, he blasphemed God, who is known
by his name only, not by his nature, or any similitude. Not as if God
were a mere name, but his is a name above every name. The translators
add of the Lord, which is implied, but not expressed, in the original,
for the greater reverence of the divine Majesty: it is a shame that it
should be found on record that the very name of Jehovah should be
blasphemed; tell it not in Gath. It is a fond conceit of the
superstitious Jews that his blasphemy was in pronouncing the name of
Jehovah, which they call ineffable: he that made himself known by that
name never forbade the calling of him by that name. It is probable that
finding himself aggrieved by the divine appointment, which separated
between the Israelites and strangers, he impudently reproached both the
law and the Law-maker, and set him at defiance. 2. He cursed either God
himself (and then his cursing was the same with blaspheming) or the
person with whom he strove. Imprecations of mischief are the hellish
language of hasty passion, as well as of rooted malice. Or perhaps he
cursed the judges that gave sentence against him; he flew in the face of
the court, and ridiculed the processes of it; thus he added sin to sin.

IV\. The caution with which he was proceeded against for this sin. The
witnesses or inferior judges brought him and his case (which was
somewhat extraordinary) unto Moses ([Lev
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#011).md), according to the order settled
([Exo 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#022).md), and Moses himself would
not give judgment hastily, but committed the offender into custody, till
he had consulted the oracle in this case. Note, Judges must deliberate;
both those that give the verdict and those that give the sentence must
consider diligently what they do, and do nothing rashly, for the
judgment is God's ([Deu 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#017).md), and
before him there will be a rehearing of the cause. They waited to know
what was the mind of the Lord, whether he was to be put to death by the
hand of the magistrate or to be left to the judgment of God: or, rather,
they wanted to know whether he should be stoned, as those were to be
that only cursed their parents ([Jdg
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#009).md), or whether, the crime being so
much greater, some sorer punishment should be inflicted on him. Note,
Those that sit in judgment should sincerely desire, and by prayer and
the use of all good means should endeavour to know the mind of the Lord,
because they judge for him ([Ch2 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#006).md)
and to him they are accountable.

V. Sentence passed upon this offender by the righteous Judge of heaven
and earth himself: Let all the congregation stone him, v. 14. God could
have cut him off by an immediate stroke from heaven, but he would put
this honour upon the institution of magistracy to make use of it for the
supporting and vindicating of his own glory in the world. Observe, 1.
The place of execution appointed: Bring him forth without the camp. To
signify their detestation of the crime, they must thus cast out the
criminal as an abominable branch, and separate him from them as an
unclean thing and unworthy a place in the camp of Israel. 2. The
executioners: Let all the congregation do it, to show their zeal for the
honour of God's name. Every man should have a stone to throw at him that
blasphemes God, reckoning himself nearly concerned in the reproaches
cast on God, [Psa 69:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009.md). Thus also the
greater terror would be cast upon the congregation; those that once
helped to stone a blasphemer would ever after dread every thing that
bordered upon blasphemy, that looked like it or looked towards it. 3.
The solemnity of the execution; before the congregation stoned him, the
witnesses were to lay their hands upon his head. The Jews say that this
was used in the execution of no criminals but blasphemers; and that it
was done with words to this purport, "Thy blood be upon thy own head,
for thou thyself hast occasioned it. Let no blame be laid on the law,
judges, juries, or witnesses; if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear
it."

VI\. A standing law made upon this occasion for the stoning of
blasphemers, [Lev 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#015.md), [Lev
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#016.md). Magistrates are the guardians
of both tables, and ought to be as jealous for the honour of God against
those that speak contemptuously of his being and government as for the
public peace and safety against the disturbers of them. 1. A great
stress is laid upon this law, as in no case to be dispensed with: He
shall surely be put to death; they shall certainly stone him. Those that
lightly esteemed God's honour might think it hard to make a man an
offender for a word (words are but wind); but God would let them know
that they must not make light of such words as these, which come from
malice against God in the heart of him that speaks, and must occasion
either great guilt or great grief to those that hear. 2. It is made to
extend to the strangers that sojourned among them, as well as those that
were born in the land. God never made any law to compel strangers to be
circumcised and embrace the Jewish religion (proselytes made by force
would be no honour to the God of Israel), but he made a law to restrain
strangers from speaking evil of the God of Israel. 3. He that was put to
death for blasphemy is said to bear his sin, in the punishment of it; no
sacrifice being appointed, on the head of which the sin might be
transferred, he himself was to bear it upon his own head, as a sacrifice
to divine justice. So his own tongue fell upon him ([Psa
64:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#008).md), and the tongue of a blasphemer
will fall heavily.

VII\. A repetition of some other laws annexed to this new law. 1. That
murder should be punished with death ([Lev
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#017.md), and again [Lev
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#021).md), according to an ancient law in
Noah's time ([Gen 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006).md), and the very
law of nature, [Gen 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#010.md). 2. That
maimers should in like manner be punished by the law of retaliation,
[Lev 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#019.md), [Lev
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#020.md). Not that men might in these
cases be their own avengers, but they might appeal to the civil
magistrate, who should award suffering to the injurious and satisfaction
to the injured as should be thought fit in proportion to the hurt done.
This law we had before, [Exo 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#004.md),
[Exo 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#005.md). And it was more agreeable
to that dispensation, in which were revealed the rigour of the law and
what sin deserved, than to the dispensation we are under, in which are
revealed the grace of the gospel and the remission of sins: and
therefore our Saviour has set aside this law ([Mat
5:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#038.md), [Mat
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039).md), not to restrain magistrates
from executing public justice, but to restrain us all from returning
personal injuries and to oblige us to forgive as we are and hope to be
forgiven. 3. That hurt done wilfully to a neighbour's cattle should be
punished by making good the damage, [Lev
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#018.md), [Lev
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#021.md). Thus the divine law took not
only their lives, but their goods also under its protection. Those
beasts which belonged to no particular person, but were, as our law
speaks, ferae naturae - of a wild nature, it was lawful for them to
kill; but not those which any man had a property in. Does God take care
for oxen? Yes; for our sakes he does. 4. That strangers, as well as
native Israelites, should be both entitled to the benefit of this law,
so as not to suffer wrong, and liable to the penalty of this law in case
they did wrong. And, it should seem, this is it that brings in these
laws here, to show how equitable it was that strangers as well as
Israelites should be punished for blasphemy, because strangers as well
as Israelites were punishable for other crimes. And there may be this
further reason for the recognition of these laws here, God would hereby
show what provision he had made for man's safety, in punishing those
that were injurious to him, which should be an argument with magistrates
to be jealous for his honour, and to punish those that blasphemed his
name. If God took care for their comfort, they ought to take care for
his glory.

VIII\. The execution of the blasphemer. Moses did, as it were, sign the
warrant or it: He spoke unto the children of Israel to do it, and they
did as the Lord commanded Moses, [Lev
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#023.md). This teaches that death is the
wages of sin, and that blasphemy in particular is an iniquity to be
punished by the judges. But, if those who thus profane the name of God
escape punishment from men, yet the Lord our God will not suffer them to
escape his righteous judgments. This blasphemer was the first that died
by the law of Moses. Stephen, the first that died for the gospel, died
by the abuse of this law; the martyr and the malefactor suffered the
same death: but how vast the difference between them!
