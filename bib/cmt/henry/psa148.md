### [Psalms Chapter 148](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 148:0</span></span>

This psalm is a most solemn and earnest call to all the creatures,
according to their capacity, to praise their Creator, and to show forth
his eternal power and Godhead, the invisible things of which are
manifested in the things that are seen. Thereby the psalmist designs to
express his great affection to the duty of praise; he is highly
satisfied that God is praised, is very desirous that he may be more
praised, and therefore does all he can to engage all about him in this
pleasant work, yea, and all who shall come after him, whose hearts must
be very dead and cold if they be not raised and enlarged, in praising
God, by the lofty flights of divine poetry which we find in this psalm.
I. He calls upon the higher house, the creatures that are placed in the
upper world, to praise the Lord, both those that are intellectual
beings, and are capable of doing it actively ([Psa
148:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#001.md), [Psa
148:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#002).md), and those that are not, and
are therefore capable of doing it only objectively ([Psa
148:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#003).md). II. He calls upon the lower
house, the creatures of this lower world, both those that can only
minister matter of praise ([Psa
148:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#007).md) and those that, being endued
with reason, are capable of offering up this sacrifice ([Psa
148:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#011).md), especially his own people,
who have more cause to do it, and are more concerned to do it, than any
other ([Psa 148:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#014).md).

[Psalms 148:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 148:1</span></span>

We, in this dark and depressed world, know but little of the world of
light and exaltation, and, conversing within narrow confines, can
scarcely admit any tolerable conceptions of the vast regions above. But
this we know,

I. That there is above us a world of blessed angels by whom God is
praised, an innumerable company of them. Thousand thousands minister
unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stand before him; and it
is his glory that he has such attendants, but much more his glory that
he neither needs them, nor is, nor can be, any way benefited by them. To
that bright and happy world the psalmist has an eye here, [Psa
148:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#001.md), [Psa
148:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#002.md). In general, to the heavens, to
the heights. The heavens are the heights, and therefore we must lift up
our souls above the world unto God in the heavens, and on things above
we must set our affections. It is his desire that God may be praised
from the heavens, that thence a praising frame may be transmitted to
this world in which we live, that while we are so cold, and low, and
flat, in praising God, there are those above who are doing it in a
better manner, and that while we are so often interrupted in this work
they rest not day nor night from it. In particular, he had an eye to
God's angels, to his hosts, and calls upon them to praise God. That
God's angels are his hosts is plain enough; as soon as they were made
they were enlisted, armed, and disciplined; he employs them in fighting
his battles, and they keep ranks, and know their place, and observe the
word of command as his hosts. But what is meant by the psalmist's
calling upon them, and exciting them to praise God, is not so easy to
account for. I will not say, They do not heed it, because we find that
to the principalities and powers is known by the church the manifold
wisdom of God ([Eph 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010).md); but I will
say, They do not need it, for they are continually praising God and
there is no deficiency at all in their performances; and therefore when,
in singing this psalm, we call upon the angels to praise God (as we did,
[Psa 103:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#020).md), we mean that we desire
God may be praised by the ablest hands and in the best manner, - that we
are pleased to think he is so, - that we have a spiritual communion with
those that dwell in his house above and are still praising him, - and
that we have come by faith, and hope, and holy love, to the innumerable
company of angels, [Heb 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022.md).

II\. That there is above us not only an assembly of blessed spirits, but
a system of vast bodies too, and those bright ones, in which God is
praised, that is, which may give us occasion (as far as we know any
thing of them) to give to God the glory not only of their being, but of
their beneficence to mankind. Observe,

1\. What these creatures are that thus show us the way in praising God,
and, whenever we look up and consider the heavens, furnish us with
matter for his praises. (1.) There are the sun, moon, and stars, which
continually, either day or night, present themselves to our view, as
looking-glasses, in which we may see a faint shadow (for so I must call
it, not a resemblance) of the glory of him that is the Father of lights,
[Psa 148:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#003.md). The greater lights, the
sun and moon, are not too great, too bright, to praise him; and the
praises of the less lights, the stars, shall not be slighted. Idolaters
made the sun, moon, and stars, their gods, and praised them, worshipping
and serving the creature, because it is seen, more than the Creator,
because he is not seen; but we, who worship the true God only, make them
our fellow-worshippers, and call upon them to praise him with us, nay,
as Levites to attend us, who, as priests, offer this spiritual
sacrifice. (2.) There are the heavens of heavens above the sun and
stars, the seat of the blessed; from the vastness and brightness of
these unknown orbs abundance of glory redounds to God, for the heavens
of heavens are the Lord's ([Psa
115:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#016).md) and yet they cannot contain
him, [Kg1 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027.md). The learned Dr.
Hammond understands her, by the heavens of heavens, the upper regions of
the air, or all the regions of it, as [Psa
68:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#033.md). We read of the heaven of
heavens, whence God sends forth his voice, and that a mighty voice,
meaning the thunder. (3.) There are the waters that are above the
heavens, the clouds that hang above in the air, where they are reserved
against the day of battle and war, [Job
38:23](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#023.md). We have reason to praise God,
not only that these waters do not drown the earth, but that they do
water it and make it fruitful. The Chaldee paraphrase reads it, Praise
him, you heavens of heavens, and you waters that depend on the word of
him who is above the heavens, for the key of the clouds is one of the
keys which God has in his hand, wherewith he opens and none can shut, he
shuts and none can open.

2\. Upon what account we are to give God the glory of them: Let them
praise the name of the Lord, that is, let us praise the name of the Lord
for them, and observe what constant and fresh matter for praise may be
fetched from them. (1.) Because he made them, gave them their powers and
assigned them their places: He commanded them (great as they are) out of
nothing, and they were created at a word's speaking. God created, and
therefore may command; for he commanded, and so created; his authority
must always be acknowledged and acquiesced in, because he once spoke
with such authority. (2.) Because he still upholds and preserves them in
their beings and posts, their powers and motions ([Psa
148:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#006).md): He hath established them for
ever and ever, that is, to the end of time, a short ever, but it is
their ever; they shall last as long as there is occasion for them. He
hath made a decree, the law of creation, which shall not pass; it was
enacted by the wisdom of God, and therefore needs not be altered, by his
sovereignty and inviolable fidelity, and therefore cannot be altered.
All the creatures that praised God at first for their creation must
praise him still for their continuance. And we have reason to praise him
that they are kept within the bounds of a decree; for to that it is
owing that the waters above the heavens have not a second time drowned
the earth.

[Psalms 148:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 148:7</span></span>

Considering that this earth, and the atmosphere that surrounds it, are
the very sediment of the universe, it concerns us to enquire after those
considerations that may be of use to reconcile us to our place in it;
and I know none more likely than this (next to the visit which the Son
of God once made to it), that even in this world, dark and as bad as it
is, God is praised: Praise you the Lord from the earth, [Psa
148:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#007.md). As the rays of the sun, which
are darted directly from heaven, reflect back (though more weakly) from
the earth, so should the praises of God, with which this cold and
infected world should be warmed and perfumed.

I. Even those creatures that are not dignified with the powers of reason
are summoned into this concert, because God may be glorified in them,
[Psa 148:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#007.md). Let the dragons or
whales, that sport themselves in the mighty waters ([Psa
104:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#026).md), dance before the Lord, to his
glory, who largely proves his own omnipotence by his dominion over the
leviathan or whale, [Job 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001.md), etc.
All deeps, and their inhabitants, praise God - the sea, and the animals
there - the bowels of the earth, and the animals there. Out of the
depths God may be praised as well as prayed unto. If we look up into the
atmosphere we meet with a great variety of meteors, which, being a king
of new productions (and some of them unaccountable), do in a special
manner magnify the power of the great Creator. There are fiery meteors;
lightning is fire, and there are other blazes sometimes kindled which
may be so called. There are watery meteors, hail, and snow, and the
vapours of which they are gendered. There are airy meteors, stormy
winds; we know not whence they come nor whither they go, whence their
mighty force comes nor how it is spent; but this we know, that, be they
ever so strong, so stormy, they fulfil God's word, and do that, and no
more than that, which he appoints them; and by this Christ showed
himself to have a divine power, that he commanded even the winds and the
seas, and they obeyed him. Those that will not fulfil God's word, but
rise up in rebellion against it, show themselves to be more violent and
headstrong than even the stormy winds, for they fulfil it. Take a view
of the surface of the earth ([Psa
148:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#009).md), and there are presented to our
view the exalted grounds, mountains and all hills, from the barren tops
of some of which, and the fruitful tops of others, we may fetch matter
for praise; there are the exalted plants, some that are exalted by their
usefulness, as the fruitful trees of various kinds, for the fruits of
which God is to be praised, others by their stateliness, as all cedars,
those trees of the Lord, [Psa 104:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#016.md).
Cedars, the high trees, are not the fruitful trees, yet they had their
use even in God's temple. Pass we next to the animal kingdom, and there
we find God glorified, even by the beasts that run wild, and all cattle
that are tame and in the service of man, [Psa
148:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#010.md). Nay, even the creeping things
have not sunk so low, nor do the flying fowl soar so high, as not to be
called upon to praise the Lord. Much of the wisdom, power, and goodness
of the Creator appears in the several capacities and instincts of the
creatures, in the provision made for them and the use made of them. When
we see all so very strange, and all so very good, surely we cannot but
acknowledge God with wonder and thankfulness.

II\. Much more those creatures that are dignified with the powers of
reason ought to employ them in praising God: Kings of the earth and all
people, [Psa 148:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#011.md), [Psa
148:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#012.md). 1. God is to be glorified in
and for these, as in and for the inferior creatures, for their hearts
are in the hand of the Lord and he makes what use he pleases of them.
God is to be praised in the order and constitution of kingdoms, the pars
imperans - the part that commands, and the pars subdita - the part that
is subject: Kings of the earth and all people. It is by him that kings
reign, and people are subject to them; the princes and judges of the
earth have their wisdom and their commission from him, and we, to whom
they are blessings, ought to bless God for them. God is to be praised
also in the constitution of families, for he is the founder of them; and
for all the comfort of relations, the comfort that parents and children,
brothers and sisters, have in each other, God is to be praised. 2. God
is to be glorified by these. Let all manner of persons praise God. (1.)
Those of each rank, high and low. The praises of kings, and princes, and
judges, are demanded; those on whom God has put honour must honour him
with it, and the power they are entrusted with, and the figure they make
in the world, put them in a capacity of bringing more glory to God and
doing him more service than others. Yet the praises of the people are
expected also, and God will graciously accept of them; Christ despised
not the hosannas of the multitude. (2.) Those of each sex, young men and
maidens, who are accustomed to make merry together; let them turn their
mirth into this channel; let it be sacred, that it may be pure. (3.)
Those of each age. Old men must still bring forth this fruit in old age,
and not think that either the gravity or the infirmity of their age will
excuse them from it; and children too must begin betimes to praise God;
even out of the mouth of babes and sucklings this good work is
perfected. A good reason is given ([Psa
148:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#013).md) why all these should praise
the name of the Lord, because his name alone is excellent and worthy to
be praised; it is a name above every name, no name, no nature, but his,
has in it all excellency. His glory is above both the earth and the
heaven, and let all inhabitants both of earth and heaven praise him and
yet acknowledge his name to be exalted far above all blessing and
praise.

III\. Most of all his own people, who are dignified with peculiar
privileges, must in a peculiar manner give glory to him, [Psa
148:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#014.md). Observe, 1. The dignity God
has put upon his people, even the children of Israel, typical of the
honour reserved for all true believers, who are God's spiritual Israel.
He exalts their horn, their brightness, their plenty, their power. The
people of Israel were, in many respects, honoured above any other
nation, for to them pertained the adoption, the glory, and the
covenants, [Rom 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md). It was their own
honour that they were a people near unto God, his Segulla, his peculiar
treasure; they were admitted into his courts, when a stranger that came
nigh must be put to death. They had him nigh to them in all that which
they called upon him for. This blessing has not come upon the Gentiles,
through Christ, for those that were afar off are by his blood made nigh,
[Eph 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#013.md). It is the greatest honour
that can be put upon a man to be brought near to god, the nearer the
better; and it will be best of all when nearest of all in the kingdom of
glory. 2. The duty God expects from them in consideration of this. Let
those whom God honours honour him: Praise you the Lord. Let him be the
praise of all his saints, the object of their praise; for he is a praise
to them. He is thy praise, and he is thy God, [Deu
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#021.md). Some by the horn of his people
understand David, as a type of Christ, whom God has exalted to be a
prince and a Saviour, who is indeed the praise of all his saints and
will be so for ever; for it is through him that they are a people near
to God.
