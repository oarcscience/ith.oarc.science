### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 17:0</span></span>

David is the man whom God now delights to honour, for he is a man after
his own heart. We read in the foregoing chapter how, after he was
anointed, Providence made him famous in the court; we read in this
chapter how Providence made him much more famous in the camp, and, by
both, not only marked him for a great man, but fitted him for the throne
for which he was designed. In the court he was only Saul's physician;
but in the camp Israel's champion; there he fairly fought, and beat
Goliath of Gath. In the story observe, I. What a noble figure Goliath
made, and how daringly he challenged the armies of Israel ([Sa1
17:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#001).md). II. What a mean figure David
made, when Providence brought him to the army (v. 12-30). III. The
unparalleled bravery wherewith David undertook to encounter this
Philistine ([Sa1 17:31-39](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#031).md). IV. The
pious resolution with which he attacked him ([Sa1
17:40-47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#040).md). V. The glorious victory he
obtained over him with a sling and a stone, and the advantage which the
Israelites thereby gained against the Philistines ([Sa1
17:48-54](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#048).md). VI. The great notice which
was hereupon taken of David at court ([Sa1
17:55-58](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#055).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 17:1</span></span>

It was not long ago that the Philistines were soundly beaten, and put to
the worse, before Israel, and they would have been totally routed if
Saul's rashness had not prevented; but here we have them making head
again. Observe,

I. How they defied Israel with their armies, [Sa1
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#001.md). They made a descent upon the
Israelites' country, and possessed themselves, as it should seem, of
some part of it, for they encamped in a place which belonged to Judah.
Israel's ground would never have been footing for Philistine-armies if
Israel had been faithful to their God. The Philistines (it is probable)
had heard that Samuel had fallen out with Saul and forsaken him, and no
longer assisted and advised him, and that Saul had grown melancholy and
unfit for business, and this news encouraged them to make this attempt
for the retrieving of the credit they had lately lost. The enemies of
the church are watchful to take all advantages, and they never have
greater advantages than when her protectors have provoked God's Spirit
and prophets to leave them. Saul mustered his forces, and faced them,
[Sa1 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#002.md), [Sa1
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#003.md). And here we must take notice, 1.
That the evil spirit, for the present, had left Saul, [Sa1
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#023.md). David's harp having given him
some relief, perhaps the alarms and affairs of the war prevented the
return of the distemper. Business is a good antidote against melancholy.
Let the mind have something without to fasten on and employ itself
about, and it will be the less in danger of preying upon itself. God, in
mercy to Israel, suspended the judgment for a while; for how distracted
must the affairs of the public have been if at this juncture the prince
had been distracted! 2. That David for the present had returned to
Bethlehem, and had left the court, [Sa1
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#015.md). When Saul had no further
occasion to use him for the relief of his distemper, though, being
anointed, he had a very good private reason, and, having a grant of the
place of Saul's armour-bearer, he had a very plausible pretence to have
continued his attendance, as a retainer to the court, yet he went home
to Bethlehem, and returned to keep his father's sheep; this was a rare
instance, in a young man that stood so fair for preferment, of humility
and affection to his parents. He knew better than most do how to come
down again after he had begun to rise, and strangely preferred the
retirements of the pastoral life before all the pleasures and gaieties
of the court. None more fit for honour than he, nor that deserved it
better, and yet none more dead to it.

II\. How they defied Israel with their champion Goliath, whom they were
almost as proud of as he was of himself, hoping by him to recover their
reputation and dominion. Perhaps the army of the Israelites was superior
in number and strength to that of the Philistines, which made the
Philistines decline a battle, and stand at bay with them, desiring
rather to put the issue upon a single combat, in which, having such a
champion, they hoped to gain the victory. Now concerning this champion
observe,

1\. His prodigious size. He was of the sons of Anak, who at Gath kept
their ground in Joshua's time ([Jos
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#022).md), and kept up a race of giants
there, of which Goliath was one, and, it is probable, one of the
largest. He was in height six cubits and a span, v. 4. They learned
bishop Cumberland has made it out that the scripture-cubit was above
twenty-one inches (above three inches more than our half-yard) and a
span was half a cubit, by which computation Goliath wanted but eight
inches of four yard in height, eleven feet and four inches, a monstrous
stature, and which made him very formidable, especially if he had
strength and spirit proportionable.

2\. His armour. Art, as well as nature, made him terrible. He was well
furnished with defensive armour ([Sa1
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#005.md), [Sa1
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#006).md): A helmet of brass on his head,
a coat of mail, made of brass plates laid over one another, like the
scales of a fish; and, because his legs would lie most within the reach
of an ordinary man, he wore brass boots, and had a large corselet of
brass about his neck. The coat is said to weigh 5000 shekels, and a
shekel was half an ounce avoirdupois, a vast weight for a man to carry,
all the other parts of his armour being proportionable. But some think
it should be translated, not the weight of the coat, but the value of
it, was 5000 shekels; so much it cost. His offensive weapons were
extraordinary, of which his spear only is here described, [Sa1
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#007.md). It was like a weaver's beam. His
arm could manage that which an ordinary man could scarcely heave. His
shield only, which was the lightest of all his accoutrements, was
carried before him by his esquire, probably for state; for he that was
clad in brass little needed a shield.

3\. His challenge. The Philistines having chosen him for their champion,
to save themselves from the hazard of battle, he here throws down the
gauntlet, and bids defiance to the armies of Israel, [Sa1
17:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#008.md). He came into the valley that
lay between the camps, and, his voice probably being as much stronger
than other people's as his arm was, he cried so as to make them all hear
him, Give me a man, that we may fight together. He looked upon himself
with admiration, because he was so much taller and stronger than all
about him; his heart (says bishop Hall) nothing but a lump of proud
flesh. He looked upon Israel with disdain, because they had none among
them of such a monstrous bulk, and defies them to find a man among them
bold enough to enter the list with him. (1.) He upbraids them with their
folly in drawing an army together: "Why have you come to set the battle
in array? How dare you oppose the mighty Philistines?" Or, "Why should
the two armies engage, when the controversy may be sooner decided, with
only the expense of one life and the hazard of another?" (2.) He offers
to put the war entirely upon the issue of the duel he proposes: "If your
champion kill me, we will be your servants; if I kill him, you shall be
ours." This, says bishop Patrick, was only a bravado, for no nation
would be willing thus to venture its all upon the success of one man,
nor is it justifiable; notwithstanding Goliath's stipulation here, when
he was killed the Philistines did not stand to his word, nor submit
themselves as servants to Israel. When he boasts, I am a Philistine, and
you are servants to Saul, he would have it thought a great piece of
condescension in him, who was a chief ruler, to enter the lists with an
Israelite; for he looked on them as no better than slaves. The Chaldee
paraphrase brings him in boasting that he was the man that had killed
Hophni and Phinehas and taken the ark prisoner, but that the Philistines
had never given him so much as the command of a regiment in recompence
of his services, whereas Saul had been made king for his services: "Let
him therefore take up the challenge."

4\. The terror this struck upon Israel: Saul and his army were greatly
afraid, [Sa1 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#011.md). The people would
not have been dismayed but that they observed Saul's courage failed him;
and it is not to be expected that, if the leader be a coward, the
followers should be bold. We found before, when the Spirit of the Lord
came upon Saul ([Sa1 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#006).md), none could
be more daring nor forward to answer the challenge of Nahash the
Ammonite, but now that the Spirit of the Lord had departed from him even
the big looks and big words of a single Philistine make him change
colour. But where was Jonathan all this while? Why did not he accept the
challenge, who, in the last war, had so bravely engaged a whole army of
Philistines? Doubtless he did not feel himself stirred up of God to it,
as he did in the former case. As the best, so the bravest men, are no
more than what God makes them. Jonathan must now sit still, because the
honour of engaging Goliath is reserved for David. In great and good
actions, the wind of the Spirit blows when and where he listeth. Now the
pious Israelites lament their king's breach with Samuel.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 17:12</span></span>

Forty days the two armies lay encamped facing one another, each
advantageously posted, but neither forward to engage. Either they were
parleying and treating of an accommodation or they were waiting for
recruits; and perhaps there were frequent skirmishes between small
detached parties. All this while, twice a day, morning and evening, did
the insulting champion appear in the field and repeat his challenge, his
own heart growing more and more proud for his not being answered and the
people of Israel more and more timorous, while God designed hereby to
ripen him for destruction and to make Israel's deliverance the more
illustrious. All this while David is keeping his father's sheep, but at
the end of forty days Providence brings him to the field to win and wear
the laurel which no other Israelite dares venture for. We have in these
verses,

I. The present state of his family. His father was old ([Sa1
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#012).md): He went among men for an old
man, was taken notice of for his great age, above what was usual at that
time, and therefore was excused from pubic services, and went not in
person to the wars, but sent his sons; he had the honours paid him that
were due his age, his hoary head was a crown of glory to him. David's
three elder brethren, who perhaps envied his place at the court, got
their father to send for him home, and let them go to the camp, where
they hoped to signalize themselves and eclipse him ([Sa1
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#013.md), [Sa1
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#014).md), while David himself was so far
from being proud of the services he had done his prince, or ambitious of
further preferment, that he not only returned from court to the
obscurity of his father's house, but to care, and toil, and (as it
proved, [Sa1 17:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#034).md) the peril, of
keeping his father's sheep. It was the praise of this humility that it
came after he had the honour of a courtier, and the reward of it that it
came before the honour of a conqueror. Before honour is humility. Now he
had that opportunity of mediation and prayer, and other acts of
devotion, which fitted him for what he was destined to more than all the
military exercises of that inglorious camp could do.

II\. The orders his father gave him to go and visit his brethren in the
camp. He did not himself ask leave to go, to satisfy his curiosity, or
to gain experience and make observations; but his father sent him on a
mean and homely errand, on which any of his servants might have gone. He
must carry some bread and cheese to his brethren, ten loaves with some
parched corn for themselves ([Sa1
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#017).md) and ten cheeses (which, it
seems, he thought too good for them) for a present to their colonel,
[Sa1 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#018.md). David must still be the
drudge of the family, though he was to be the greatest ornament of it.
He had not so much as an ass at command to carry his load, but must take
it on his back, and yet run to the camp. Jesse, we thought, was privy to
his being anointed, and yet industriously kept him thus mean and
obscure, probably to hide him from the eye of suspicion and envy,
knowing that he was anointed to a crown in reversion. He must observe
how his brethren fared, whether they were not reduced to short
allowance, now that the encampment continued so long, that, if need
were, he might send them more provisions. And he must take their pledge,
that is, if they had pawned any thing, he must redeem it; take notice of
their company, so some observe, whom they associate with, and what sort
of life they lead. Perhaps David, like Joseph, had formerly brought to
his father their evil report, and now he sends him to enquire concerning
their manners. See the care the pious parents about their children when
they are abroad from them, especially in places of temptation; they are
solicitous how they conduct themselves, and particularly what company
they keep. Let children think of this, and conduct themselves
accordingly, remembering that, when they are from under their parents'
eye, they are still under God's eye.

III\. David's dutiful obedience to his father's command. His prudence
and care made him be up early ([Sa1
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#020).md), and yet not to leave his sheep
without a keeper, so faithful was he in a few things and therefore the
fitter to be made ruler over many things, and so well had he learnt to
obey before he pretended to command. God's providence brought him to the
camp very seasonably, when both sides had set the battle in array, and,
as it should seem, were more likely to come to an engagement than they
had yet been during all the forty days, [Sa1
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#021.md). Both sides were now preparing
to fight. Jesse little thought of sending his son to the army just at
that critical juncture, but the wise God orders the time and all the
circumstances of actions and affairs so as to serve his designs of
securing the interests of Israel and advancing the men after his own
heart. Now observe here,

1\. How brisk and lively David was, [Sa1
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#022.md). What articles he brought he
honestly took care of, and left them with those that had the charge of
the bag and baggage; but, though he had come a long journey with a great
load, he ran into the army, to see what was doing there, and to pay his
respects to his brethren. Seest thou a man thus diligent in his
business, he is in the way of preferment, he shall stand before kings.

2\. How bold and daring the Philistine was, [Sa1
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#023.md). Now that the armies were drawn
out into a line of battle he appeared first to renew his challenge,
vainly imagining that he was in the eager chase of his own glory and
triumph, whereas really he was but courting his own destruction.

3\. How timorous and faint-hearted the men of Israel were. Though they
had, for forty days together, been used to his haughty looks and
threatening language, and, having seen no execution done by either,
might have learned to despise both, yet, upon his approach, they fled
from him and were greatly afraid, [Sa1
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#024.md). One Philistine could never thus
have chased 1000 Israelites, and put 10,000 to flight, unless their
Rock, being treacherously forsaken by them, had justly sold them, and
shut them up, [Deu 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030.md).

4\. How high Saul bid for a champion. Though he was the tallest of all
the men of Israel, and, if he had not been so, while he kept close to
God might himself have safely taken up the gauntlet which this insolent
Philistine threw down, yet, the Spirit of the Lord having departed from
him, he durst not do it, nor press Jonathan to do it; but whoever will
do it shall have as good preferment as he can give him, [Sa1
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#025.md). If the hope of wealth and
honour will prevail with any man to expose himself so far, it is
proclaimed that the bold adventurer, if he come off, shall marry the
king's daughter and have a good portion with her; but, as it should
seem, whether he come off or no, his father's house shall be free in
Israel, from all toll, tribute, custom, and services to the crown, or
shall be ennobled and advanced to the peerage.

5\. How much concerned David was to assert the honour of God and Israel
against the impudent challenges of this champion. He asked what reward
was promised to him that should slay this Philistine ([Sa1
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#026).md), though he knew already, not
because he was ambitious of the honour, but because he would have it
taken notice of, and reported to Saul, how much he resented the
indignity hereby done to Israel and Israel's God. He might have presumed
so far upon his acquaintance and interest at court as to go himself to
Saul to offer his service; but his modesty would not let him do this. It
was one of his own rules, before it was one of his son's proverbs, Put
not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the
place of great men ([Pro 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#006).md); yet
his zeal put him upon that method which he hoped would bring him into
this great engagement. Two considerations, it seems, fired David with a
holy indignation: - (1.) That the challenger was one that was
uncircumcised, a stranger to God and out of covenant with him. (2.) That
the challenged were the armies of the living God, devoted to him,
employed by him and for him, so that the affronts offered to them
reflected upon the living God himself, and that he could not bear. When
therefore some had told him what was the reward proposed for killing the
Philistine ([Sa1 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#027).md) he asked
others ([Sa1 17:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#030).md), with the same
resentment, which he expected would at length come to Saul's ear.

6\. How he was brow-beaten and discouraged by his eldest brother Eliab,
who, taking notice of his forwardness, fell into a passion upon it, and
gave David very abusive language, [Sa1
17:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#028). Consider this, (1..md) As the
fruit of Eliab's jealousy. He was the eldest brother, and David the
youngest, and perhaps it had been customary with him (as it is with too
many elder brothers) to trample upon him and take every occasion to
chide him. But those who thus exalt themselves over their juniors may
perhaps live to see themselves, by a righteous providence, abased, and
those to whom they are abusive exalted. Time may come when the elder may
serve the younger. But Eliab was now vexed that his younger brother
should speak those bold words against the Philistine which he himself
durst not say. He knew what honour David had already had in the court,
and, if he should now get honour in the camp (from which he thought he
had found means effectually to seclude him, [Sa1
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#015).md), the glory of his elder
brethren would be eclipsed and stained; and therefore (such is the
nature of jealousy) he would rather that Goliath should triumph over
Israel than that David should be the man that should triumph over him.
Wrath is cruel and anger is outrageous, but who can stand before envy,
especially the envy of a brother, the keenness of which Jacob, and
Joseph, and David experienced? See [Pro
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#019.md). It is very ill-favoured
language that Eliab here gives him; not only unjust and unkind, but, at
this time, basely ungrateful; for David was now sent by his father, as
Joseph by his, on a kind of visit to his brethren. Eliab intended, in
what he said, not only to grieve and discourage David himself, and
quench that noble fire which he perceived glowing in his breast, but to
represent him to those about him as an idle proud lad, not fit to be
taken notice of. He gives them to understand that his business was only
to keep sheep, and falsely insinuates that he was a careless unfaithful
shepherd; though he had left his charge in good hands ([Sa1
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#020).md), yet he must tauntingly be
asked, With whom hast thou left those few sheep? Though he came down now
to the camp in disobedience to his father and kindness to his brethren,
and Eliab knew this, yet his coming is turned to his reproach: "Thou
hast come down, not to do any service, but to gratify thy own curiosity,
and only to look about thee;" and thence he will infer the pride and
naughtiness of his heart, and pretends to know it as certainly as if he
were in his bosom. David could appeal to God concerning his humility and
sincerity ([Psa 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003.md); [Psa
131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001).md) and at this time gave proofs of
both, and yet could not escape this hard character from his own brother.
See the folly, absurdity, and wickedness, of a proud and envious
passion; how groundless its jealousies are, how unjust its censures, how
unfair its representations, how bitter its invectives, and how indecent
its language. God, by his grace, keep us from such a spirit! (2.) As a
trial of David's meekness, patience and constancy. A short trial it was,
and he approved himself well in it; for, \[1.\] He bore the provocation
with admirable temper ([Sa1 17:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#029).md):
"What have I now done? What fault have I committed, for which I should
thus be chidden? Is there not a cause for my coming to the camp, when my
father sent me? Is there not a cause for my resenting the injury done to
Israel's honour by Goliath's challenges?" He had right and reason on his
side, and knew it, and therefore did not render railing for railing, but
with a soft answer turned away his brother's wrath. This conquest of his
own passion was in some respects more honourable than his conquest of
Goliath. He that hath rule over his own spirit is better than the
mighty. It was no time for David to quarrel with his brother when the
Philistines were upon them. The more threatening the church's enemies
are the more forbearing her friends should be with one another. \[2.\]
He broke through the discouragement with admirable resolution. He would
not be driven off from his thoughts of engaging the Philistine by the
ill-will of his brother. Those that undertake great and public services
must not think it strange if they be discountenanced and opposed by
those from whom they had reason to expect support and assistance; but
must humbly go on with their work, in the face not only of their
enemies' threats, but of their friends' slights and suspicions.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa1 17:31</span></span>

David is at length presented to Saul for his champion ([Sa1
17:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#031).md) and he bravely undertakes to
fight the Philistine ([Sa1 17:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#032).md): Let
no man's heart fail because of him. It would have reflected too much
upon the valour of his prince if he had said, Let not thy heart fail;
therefore he speaks generally: Let no man's heart fail. A little
shepherd, come but this morning from keeping sheep, has more courage
than all the mighty men of Israel, and encourages them. Thus does God
often send good words to his Israel, and do great things for them, by
the weak and foolish things of the world. David only desires a
commission from Saul to go and fight with the Philistine, but says
nothing to him of the reward he had proposed, because that was not the
thing he was ambitious of, but only the honour of serving God and his
country: nor would he seem to question Saul's generosity. Two things
David had to do with Saul: -

I. To get clear of the objection Saul made against his undertaking.
"Alas!" says Saul, "thou hast a good heart to it, but art by no means an
equal match for this Philistine. To engage with him is to throw away a
life which may better be reserved for more agreeable services. Thou art
but a youth, rash and inconsiderate, weak and unversed in arms: he is a
man that has the head and hands of a man, a man of war, trained up and
inured to it from his youth ([Sa1
17:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#033).md), and how canst thou expect but
that he will be too hard for thee?" David, as he had answered his
brother's passion with meekness, so he answered Saul's fear with faith,
and gives a reason of the hope which was in him that he should conquer
the Philistine, to the satisfaction of Saul. We have reason to fear that
Saul had no great acquaintance with nor regard to the word of God, and
therefore David, in reasoning with him, fetched not his arguments and
encouragements thence, how much soever he had an eye to it in his own
mind. But he argues from experience; though he was but a youth, and
never in the wars, yet perhaps he had done as much as the killing of
Goliath came to, for he had had, by divine assistance, spirit enough to
encounter and strength enough to subdue a lion once and another time a
bear that robbed him of his lambs, [Sa1
17:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#034.md). To these he compares this
uncircumcised Philistine, looks upon him to be as much a ravenous beast
as either of them, and therefore doubts not but to deal as easily with
him; and hereby he gives Saul to understand that he was not so
inexperienced in hazardous combats as he took him to be.

1\. He tells his story like a man of spirit. He is not ashamed to own
that he kept his father's sheep, which his brother had just now
upbraided him with. So far is he from concealing it that from his
employment as a shepherd he fetches the experience that now animated
him. But he lets those about him know that he was no ordinary shepherd.
Whatever our profession or calling is, be it ever so mean, we should
labour to excel in it, and do the business of it in the best manner.
When David kept sheep, (1.) He approved himself very careful and tender
of his flock, though it was not his own, but his father's. He could not
see a lamb in distress but he would venture his life to rescue it. This
temper made him fit to be a king, to whom the lives of subjects should
be dear and their blood precious ([Psa
72:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#014).md), and fit to be a type of
Christ, the good Shepherd, who gathers the lambs in his arms and carries
them in his bosom ([Isa 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011).md), and
who not only ventured, but laid down his life for his sheep. Thus too
was David fit to be an example to ministers with the utmost care and
diligence to watch for souls, that they be not a prey to the roaring
lion. (2.) He approved himself very bold and brave in the defence of his
flock. This was that which he was now concerned to give proof of, and
better evidence could not be demanded than this: "Thy servant not only
rescued the lambs, but, to revenge the injury, slew both the lion and
the bear."

2\. He applies his story like a man of faith. He owns ([Sa1
17:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#037).md) it was the Lord that delivered
him from the lion and the bear; to him he gives the praise of that great
achievement, and thence he infers, He will deliver me out of the hand of
this Philistine. "The lion and the bear were enemies only to me and my
sheep, and it was in defence of my own interest that I attacked them;
but this Philistine is an enemy to God and Israel, defies the armies of
the living God, and it is for their honour that I attack him." Note,
(1.) Our experiences ought to be improved by us as our encouragements to
trust in God and venture in the way of duty. He that has delivered does
and will. (2.) By the care which common Providence takes of the inferior
creatures, and the protection they are under, we may be encouraged to
depend upon that special Providence which surrounds the Israel of God.
He that sets bounds to the waves of the sea and the rage of wild beasts
can and will restrain the wrath of wicked men. Paul seems to allude to
this of David ([Ti2 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#017.md), [Ti2
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#018).md), I was delivered out of the
mouth of the lion, and therefore, I trust, the Lord shall deliver me.
And perhaps David here thought of the story of Samson, and encouraged
himself with it; for his slaying a lion was a happy presage of his many
illustrious victories over the Philistines in single combat. Thus David
took off Saul's objection against his undertaking, and gained a
commission to fight the Philistine, with which Saul gave him a hearty
good wish; since he would not venture himself, he prayed for him that
would: Go, and the Lord be with thee, a good word, if it was not spoken
customarily, and in a formal manner, as too often it is. But David has
somewhat to do likewise,

II\. To get clear of the armour wherewith Saul would, by all means, have
him dressed up when he went upon this great action ([Sa1
17:38](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#038).md): He armed David with his
armour, not that which he wore himself, the disproportion of his stature
would not admit that, but some that he kept in his armoury, little
thinking that he on whom he now put his helmet and coat of mail must
shortly inherit his crown and robe. David, being not yet resolved which
way to attack his enemy, girded on his sword, not knowing, as yet, but
he should have occasion to make use of it; but he found the armour would
but encumber him, and would be rather his burden than his defence, and
therefore he desires leave of Saul to put them off again: I cannot go
with these, for I have not proved them, that is, "I have never been
accustomed to such accoutrements as these." We may suppose Saul's armour
was both very fine and very firm, but what good would it do David if it
were not fit, or if he knew not how to manage himself in it? Those that
aim at things above their education and usage, and covet the attire and
armour of princes, forget that that is the best for us which we are fit
for and accustomed to; if we had our desire, we should wish to be in our
own coat again, and should say, "We cannot go with these;" we had
therefore better go without them.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:40](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">sa1 17:40</span></span>

We are now coming near this famous combat, and have in these verses the
preparations and remonstrances made on both sides.

I. The preparations made on both sides for the encounter. The Philistine
was already fixed, as he had been daily for the last forty days. Well
might he go with his armour, for he had sufficiently proved it. Only we
are told ([Sa1 17:41](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#041).md) that he came on
and drew near, a signal, it is likely, being given that his challenge
was accepted, and, as if he distrusted his helmet and coat of mail, a
man went before him, carrying his shield, for his own hands were full
with his sword and spear, [Sa1 17:45](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#045.md).
But what arms and ammunition is David furnished with? Truly none but
what he brought with him as a shepherd; no breastplate, nor corselet,
but his plain shepherd's coat; no spear, but his staff; no sword nor
bow, but his sling; no quiver, but his scrip; nor any arrows, but,
instead of them, five smooth stones picked up out of the brook, [Sa1
17:40](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#040.md). By this it appeared that his
confidence was purely in the power of God, and not in any sufficiency of
his own, and that now at length he who put it into his heart to fight
the Philistine put it into his head with what weapons to do it.

II\. The conference which precedes the encounter, in which observe,

1\. How very proud Goliath was, (1.) With what scorn he looked upon his
adversary, [Sa1 17:42](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#042.md). He looked
about, expecting to meet some tall strong man, but, when he saw what a
mean figure he made with whom he was to engage, he disdained him,
thought it below him to enter the lists with him, fearing that the
contemptibleness of the champion he contended with would lessen the
glory of his victory. He took notice of his person, that he was but a
youth, not come to his strength, ruddy and of a fair countenance, fitter
to accompany the virgins of Israel in their dances (if mixed dancing was
then in use) than to lead on the men of Israel in their battles. He took
notice of his array with great indignation ([Sa1
17:43](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#043).md): "Am I a dog, that thou comest
to me with staves? Dost thou think to beat me as easily as thou dost thy
shepherd's dog?" (2.) With what confidence he presumed upon his success.
He cursed David by his gods, imprecating the impotent vengeance of his
idols against him, thinking these fire-balls thrown about him would
secure his success: and therefore, in confidence of that, he darts his
grimaces, as if threatening words would kill ([Sa1
17:44](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#044).md): "Come to me, and I will give
thy flesh to the fowls of the air, it will be a tender and delicate
feast for them." Thus the security and presumption of fools destroy
them.

2\. How very pious David was. His speech savours nothing of ostentation,
but God is all in all in it, [Sa1
17:45-47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#045). (1..md) He derives his
authority from God: "I come to thee by warrant and commission from
heaven, in the name of the Lord, who has called me to and anointed me
for this undertaking, who, by his universal providence, is the Lord of
hosts, of all hosts, and therefore has power to do what he pleases, and,
by the special grace of his covenant, is the God of the armies of
Israel, and therefore has engaged and will employ his power for their
protection, and against thee who hast impiously defied them." The name
of God David relied on, as Goliath did on his sword and spear. See [Psa
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007.md); [Psa
118:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#010.md), [Psa
118:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#011). (2..md) He depends for success
upon God, [Sa1 17:46](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#046.md). David speaks
with as much assurance as Goliath had done, but upon better ground; it
is his faith that says, "This day will the Lord deliver thee into my
hand, and not only thy carcase, but the carcases of the host of the
Philistines, shall be given to the birds and beasts of prey." (3.) He
devotes the praise and glory of all to God. He did not, like Goliath,
seek his own honour, but the honour of God, not doubting but by the
success of this action, \[1.\] All the world should be made to know that
there is a God, and that the God of Israel is the one only living and
true God, and all other pretended deities are vanity and a lie. \[2.\]
All Israel (whom he calls not this army, but this assembly, or church,
because they were now religiously attending the goings of their God and
King, as they used to do in the sanctuary) shall know that the Lord
saveth not with sword and spear ([Sa1
17:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#047).md), but can, when he pleases, save
without either and against both, [Psa
46:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#009.md). David addresses himself to this
combat rather as a priest that was going to offer a sacrifice to the
justice of God than as a soldier that was going to engage an enemy of
his country.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:48](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">sa1 17:48</span></span>

Here is 1. The engagement between the two champions, [Sa1
17:48](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#048.md). To this engagement the
Philistine advanced with a great deal of state and gravity; if he must
encounter a pigmy, yet it shall be with the magnificence of a giant and
a grandee. This is intimated in the manner of expression: He arose, and
came, and drew nigh, like a stalking mountain, overlaid with brass and
iron, to meet David. David advanced with no less activity and
cheerfulness, as one that aimed more to do execution than to make a
figure: He hasted, and ran, being lightly clad, to meet the Philistine.
We may imagine with what tenderness and compassion the Israelites saw
such a pleasing youth as this throwing himself into the mouth of
destruction, but he knew whom he had believed and for whom he acted. 2.
The fall of Goliath in this engagement. He was in no haste, because in
no fear, but confident that he should soon at one stroke cleave his
adversary's head; but, while he was preparing to do it solemnly, David
did his business effectually, without any parade: he slang a stone which
hit him in the forehead, and, in the twinkling of an eye, fetched him to
the ground, [Sa1 17:49](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#049.md). Goliath knew
there were famous slingers in Israel ([Jdg
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#016).md), yet was either so forgetful or
presumptuous as to go with the beaver of his helmet open, and thither,
to the only part left exposed, not so much David's art as God's
providence directed the stone, and brought it with such force that it
sunk into his head, notwithstanding the impudence with which his
forehead was brazened. See how frail and uncertain life is, even when it
thinks itself best fortified, and how quickly, how easily, and with how
small a matter, the passage may be opened for life to go out and death
to enter. Goliath himself has not power over the spirit to retain the
spirit, [Ecc 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#008.md). Let not the strong
man glory in his strength, nor the armed man in his armour. See how God
resists the proud and pours contempt upon those that bid defiance to him
and his people. None ever hardened his heart against God and prospered.
One of the Rabbin thinks that when Goliath said to David, Come, and I
will give thy flesh to the fowls of the air, he threw up his head so
hastily that his helmet fell off, and so left his broad forehead a fair
mark for David. To complete the execution, David drew Goliath's own
sword, a two-handed weapon for David, and with it cut off his head, [Sa1
17:51](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#051.md). What need had David to take a
sword of his own? his enemy's sword shall serve his purpose, when he has
occasion for one. God is greatly glorified when his proud enemies are
cut off with their own sword and he makes their own tongues to fall upon
them, [Psa 64:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#008.md). David's victory over
Goliath was typical of the triumphs of the son of David over Satan and
all the powers of darkness, whom he spoiled, and made a show of them
openly ([Col 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015).md), and we through him
are more than conquerors. 3. The defeat of the Philistines' army
hereupon. They relied wholly upon the strength of their champion, and
therefore, when they saw him slain, they did not, as Goliath had
offered, throw down their arms and surrender themselves servants to
Israel ([Sa1 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#009).md), but took to their
heels, being wholly dispirited, and thinking it to no purpose to oppose
one before whom such a mighty man had fallen: They fled ([Sa1
17:51](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#051).md), and this put life into the
Israelites, who shouted and pursued them (David, it is probable, leading
them on in the pursuit) even to the gates of their own cities, [Sa1
17:52](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#052.md). In their return from the chase
they seized all the baggage, plundered the tents ([Sa1
17:53](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#053).md), and enriched themselves with
the spoil. 4. David's disposal of his trophies, [Sa1
17:54](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#054.md). He brought the head of the
Philistine to Jerusalem, to be a terror to the Jebusites, who held the
strong-hold of Sion: it is probable that he carried it in triumph to
other cities. His armour he laid up in his tent; only the sword was
preserved behind the ephod in the tabernacle, as consecrated to God, and
a memorial of the victory to his honour, [Sa1
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#009.md). 5. The notice that was taken of
David. Though he had been at court formerly, yet, having been for some
time absent ([Sa1 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#015).md), Saul had
forgotten him, being melancholy and mindless, and little thinking that
his musician would have spirit enough to be his champion; and therefore,
as if he had never seen him before, he asked whose son he was. Abner was
a stranger to him, but brought him to Saul ([Sa1
17:57](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#057).md), and he gave a modest account
of himself, [Sa1 17:58](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#058.md). And now he was
introduced to the court with much greater advantages than before, in
which he owned God's hand performing all things for him.
