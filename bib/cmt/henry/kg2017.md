[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 17:0</span></span>

This chapter gives us an account of the captivity of the ten tribes, and
so finishes the history of that kingdom, after it had continued about
265 years, from the setting up of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. In it we
have, I. A short narrative of this destruction ([Kg2
17:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#001).md). II. Remarks upon it, and the
causes of it, for the justifying of God in it and for warning to others
(v. 7-23). III. An account of the nations which succeeded them in the
possession of their land, and the mongrel religion set up among them (v.
24-41).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 17:1</span></span>

We have here the reign and ruin of Hoshea, the last of the kings of
Israel, concerning whom observe,

I. That, though he forced his way to the crown by treason and murder (as
we read [Kg2 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#030).md), yet he gained not
the possession of it till seven or eight years after; for it was in the
fourth year of Ahaz that he slew Pekah, but did not himself begin to
reign till the twelfth year of Ahaz, [Kg2
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#001.md). Whether by the king of Assyria,
or by the king of Judah, or by some of his own people, does not appear,
but it seems so long he was kept out of the throne he aimed at. Justly
were his bad practices thus chastised, and the word of the prophet was
thus fulfilled ([Hos 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#003).md), Now they
shall say We have no king, because we feared not the Lord.

II\. That, though he was bad, yet not so bad as the kings of Israel had
been before him ([Kg2 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#002).md), not so
devoted to the calves as they had been. One of them (that at Dan), the
Jews say, had been, before this, carried away by the king of Assyria in
the expedition recorded [Kg2 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md),
(to which perhaps the prophet refers, [Hos
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#005.md), Thy calf, O Samaria! has cast
thee off), which made him put the less confidence in the other. And some
say that this Hoshea took off the embargo which the former kings had put
their subjects under, forbidding them to go up to Jerusalem to worship,
which he permitted those to do that had a mind to it. But what shall we
think of this dispensation of providence, that the destruction of the
kingdom of Israel should come in the reign of one of the best of its
kings? Thy judgments, O God! are a great deep. God would hereby show
that in bringing this ruin upon them he designed to punish, 1. Not only
the sins of that generation, but of the foregoing ages, and to reckon
for the iniquities of their fathers, who had been long in filing the
measure and treasuring up wrath against this day of wrath. 2. Not only
the sins of their kings, but the sins of the people. If Hoshea was not
so bad as the former kings, yet the people were as bad as those that
went before them, and it was an aggravation of their badness, and
brought ruin the sooner, that their king did not set them so bad an
example as the former kings had done, nor hinder them from reforming; he
gave them leave to do better, but they did as bad as ever, which laid
the blame of their sin and ruin wholly upon themselves.

III\. That the destruction came gradually. They were for some time made
tributaries before they were made captives to the king of Assyria ([Kg2
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#003).md), and, if that less judgment had
prevailed to humble and reform them, the greater would have been
prevented.

IV\. That they brought it upon themselves by the indirect course they
took to shake off the yoke of the king of Assyria, [Kg2
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#004.md). Had the king and people of
Israel applied to God, made their peace with him and their prayers to
him, they might have recovered their liberty, ease, and honour; but they
withheld their tribute, and trusted to the king of Egypt to assist them
in their revolt, which, if it had taken effect, would have been but to
change their oppressors. But Egypt became to them the staff of a broken
reed. This provoked the king of Assyria to proceed against them with the
more severity. Men get nothing by struggling with the net, but entangle
themselves the more.

V. That it was an utter destruction that came upon them. 1. The king of
Israel was made a prisoner; he was shut up and bound, being, it is
probable, taken by surprise, before Samaria was besieged. 2. The land of
Israel was made a prey. The army of the king of Assyria came up
throughout all the land, made themselves master of it ([Kg2
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#005).md), and treated the people as
traitors to be punished with the sword of justice rather than as fair
enemies. 3. The royal city of Israel was besieged, and at length taken.
Three years it held out after the country was conquered, and no doubt a
great deal of misery was endured at that time which is not particularly
recorded; but the brevity of the story, and the passing of this matter
over lightly, methinks, intimate that they were abandoned of God and he
did not now regard the affliction of Israel, as sometimes as he had
done. 4. The people of Israel were carried captives into Assyria, [Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006.md). The generality of the people,
those that were of any note, were forced away into the conqueror's
country, to be slaves and beggars there. (1.) Thus he was pleased to
exercise a dominion over them, and to show that they were entirely at
his disposal. (2.) By depriving them of their possessions and estates,
real and personal, and exposing them to all the hardships and reproaches
of a removal to a strange country, under the power of an imperious army,
he chastised them for their rebellion and their endeavour to shake off
his yoke. (3.) Thus he effectually prevented all such attempts for the
future and secured their country to himself. (4.) Thus he got the
benefit of their service in his own country, as Pharaoh did that of
their fathers; and so this unworthy people were lost as they were found,
and ended as they began, in servitude and under oppression. (5.) Thus he
made room for those of his own country that had little, and little to
do, at home, to settle in a good land, a land flowing with milk and
honey. In all these several ways he served himself by this captivity of
the ten tribes. We are here told in what places of his kingdom he
disposed of them - in Halah and Habor, in places, we may suppose, far
distant from each other, lest they should keep up a correspondence,
incorporate again, and become formidable. There, we have reason to
think, after some time they were so mingled with the nations that they
were lost, and the name of Israel was no more in remembrance. Those that
forgot God were themselves forgotten; those that studied to be like the
nations were buried among them; and those that would not serve God in
their own land were made to serve their enemies in a strange land. It is
probable that they were the men of honour and estates who were carried
captive, and that many of the meaner sort of people were left behind,
many of every tribe, who either went over to Judah or became subject to
the Assyrian colonies, and their posterity were Galileans or Samaritans.
But thus ended Israel as a nation; now they became Lo-ammi - not a
people, and Lo-ruhamah - unpitied. Now Canaan spued them out. When we
read of their entry under Hoshea the son of Nun who would have thought
that such as this should be their exit under Hoshea the son of Elah?
Thus Rome's glory in Augustus sunk, many ages after, in Augustulus.
Providence so ordered the eclipsing of the honour of the ten tribes that
the honour of Judah (the royal tribe) and Levi (the holy tribe), which
yet remained, might shine the brighter. Yet we find a number sealed of
every one of the twelve tribes (Rev. 7) except Dan. James writes to the
twelve tribes scattered abroad ([Jam
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001).md) and Paul speaks of the twelve
tribes which instantly served God day and night ([Act
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#007).md); so that though we never read of
those that were carried captive, nor have any reason to credit the
conjecture of some (that they yet remain a distinct body in some remote
corner of the world), yet a remnant of them did escape, to keep up the
name of Israel, till it came to be worn by the gospel church, the
spiritual Israel, in which it will ever remain, [Gal
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 17:7</span></span>

Though the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes was but briefly
related, it is in these verses largely commented upon by our historian,
and the reasons of it assigned, not taken from the second causes - the
weakness of Israel, their impolitic management, and the strength and
growing greatness of the Assyrian monarch (these things are overlooked)
- but only from the First Cause. Observe, 1. It was the Lord that
removed Israel out of his sight; whoever were the instruments, he was
the author of this calamity. It was destruction from the Almighty; the
Assyrian was but the rod of his anger, [Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md). It was the Lord that rejected
the seed of Israel, else their enemies could not have seized upon them,
[Kg2 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#020.md). Who gave Jacob for a
spoil, and Israel to the robbers? Did not the Lord? [Isa
43:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#024.md). We lose the benefit of national
judgments if we do not eye the hand of God in them, and the fulfilling
of the scripture, for that also is taken notice of here ([Kg2
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#023).md): The Lord removed Israel out of
his favour, and out of their own land, as he had said by all his
servants the prophets. Rather shall heaven and earth pass than one
tittle of God's word fall to the ground. When God's word and his works
are compared, it will be found not only that they agree, but that they
illustrate each other. But why would God ruin a people that were raised
and incorporated, as Israel was, by miracles and oracles? Why would he
undo that which he himself had done at so vast an expense? Was it purely
an act of sovereignty? No, it was an act of necessary justice. For, 2.
They provoked him to do this by their wickedness. Was it God's doing?
Nay, it was their own; by their way and their doings they procured all
this to themselves, and it was their own wickedness that did correct
them. This the sacred historian shows here at large, that it might
appear that God did them no wrong and that others might hear and fear.
Come and see what it was that did all this mischief, that broke their
power and laid their honour in the dust; it was sin; that, and nothing
else, separated between them and God. This is here very movingly laid
open as the cause of all the desolations of Israel. He here shows,

I. What God had done for Israel, to engage them to serve him. 1. He gave
them their liberty ([Kg2 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#007).md): He
brought them from under the hand of Pharaoh who oppressed them, asserted
their freedom (Israel is my son), and effected their freedom with a high
hand. Thus they were bound in duty and gratitude to be his servants, for
he had loosed their bonds; nor would he that rescued them out of the
hand of the king of Egypt have contradicted himself so far as to deliver
them into the hand of the king of Assyria, as he did, if they had not,
by their iniquity, betrayed their liberty and sold themselves. 2. He
gave them their law, and was himself their king. They were immediately
under a divine regimen. They could not plead ignorance of good and evil,
sin and duty, for God had particularly charged them against those very
things which here he charges them with ([Kg2
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#015).md), That they should not do like
the heathen. Nor could they be in any doubt concerning their obligation
to observe the laws which they are here charged with rejecting, for they
were the commandments and statutes of the Lord their God ([Kg2
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#013).md), so that no room was left to
dispute whether they should keep them or no. He had not dealt so with
other nations, [Psa 147:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#019.md), [Psa
147:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#020.md). 3. He gave them their land,
for he cast out the heathen from before them ([Kg2
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#008).md), to make room for them; and the
casting out of them for their idolatries was as fair a warning as could
be given to Israel not to do like them.

II\. What they had done against God, notwithstanding these engagements
which he had laid upon them. 1. In general. They sinned against the Lord
their God ([Kg2 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#007).md), they did those
things that were not right ([Kg2
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#009).md), but secretly. So wedded were
they to their evil practices that when they could not do them publicly,
could not for shame or could not for fear, they would do them secretly -
an evidence of their atheism, that they thought what was done in secret
was from under the eye of God himself and would not be required. Again,
they wrought wicked things in such a direct contradiction to the divine
law that they seemed as if they were done on purpose to provoke the Lord
to anger ([Kg2 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#011).md), in contempt of
his authority and defiance of his justice. They rejected God's statutes
and his covenant ([Kg2 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#015).md), would
not be bound up either by his command or the consent they themselves had
given to the covenant, but threw off the obligations of both, and
therefore God justly rejected them, [Kg2
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#020.md). See [Hos
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006.md). They left all the commandments of
the Lord their God ([Kg2 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#016).md), left
the way, left the work, which those commandments prescribed them and
directed them in. Nay, lastly, they sold themselves to do evil in the
sight of the Lord, that is, they wholly addicted themselves to sin, as
slaves to the service of those to whom they are sold, and, by their
obstinately persisting in sin, so hardened their own hearts that at
length it had become morally impossible for them to recover themselves,
as one that has sold himself has put his liberty past recall. 2. In
particular. Though they were guilty (no doubt) of many immoralities, and
violated all the commands of the second table, yet nothing is here
specified, but their idolatry. This was the sin that did most easily
beset them; this was, of all sins, most provoking to God: it was the
spiritual adultery that broke the marriage-covenant, and was the inlet
of all other wickedness. Hence it is again and again mentioned here as
the sin that ruined them. (1.) They feared other gods ([Kg2
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#007).md), that is, worshipped them and
paid their homage to them, as if they feared their displeasure. (2.)
They walked in the statutes of the heathen, which were contrary to God's
statutes ([Kg2 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#008).md), did as did the
heathen ([Kg2 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#011).md), went after the
heathen that were round about them ([Kg2
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#015).md), so prostituting the honour of
their peculiarity, and defeating God's design concerning them, which was
that they should be distinguished from the heathen. Must those that were
taught of God go to school to the heathen - those that were appropriated
to God take their measures from the nations that were abandoned by him?
(3.) They walked in the statutes of the idolatrous kings of Israel ([Kg2
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#008).md), in all the sins of Jeroboam,
[Kg2 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#022.md). When their kings assumed a
power to alter and add to the divine institutions they submitted to
them, and thought the command of their kings would bear them out in
disobedience to the command of their God. (4.) They built themselves
high places in all their cities, [Kg2
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#009.md). If in any place there was but
the tower of the watchmen (a country tower that had no walls, but only a
tower to shelter the watch in time of danger), or but a lodge for
shepherds, it must be honoured with a high place, and that with an
altar. If there was a fenced city, it must be further fortified with a
high place. Having forsaken God's only place, they knew no end of high
places, in which every man followed his own fancy and directed his
devotion to what god he pleased. Sacred things were hereby profaned and
laid common, when their altars were as heaps in the furrows of the
field, [Hos 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011). (5..md) They set them
up images and groves - Asherim (even wooden images, so some think the
term, which we translate groves, should be rendered) or Ashtaroth (so
others) - directed contrary to the second commandment, [Kg2
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#010.md). They served idols ([Kg2
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#012).md), the works of their own hands
and creatures of their own fancy, though God had warned them
particularly not to do this thing. (6.) They burnt incense in all the
high places, to the honour of strange gods, for it was to the dishonour
of the true God, [Kg2 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#011). (7..md) They
followed vanity. Idols are called so, because they could do neither good
nor evil, but were the most insignificant things that could be; those
that worshipped them were like unto them, and so they became vain and
good for nothing ([Kg2 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#016).md), vain in
their devotions, which were brutish and ridiculous, and so became vain
in their whole conversation. (8.) Besides the molten images, even the
two calves, they worshipped all the host of heaven - the sun, moon, and
stars: for it is not meant of the heavenly host of angels; they could
not rise so far above sensible things as to think of them. And, withal,
they served Baal, the deified heroes of the Gentiles, [Kg2
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#016). (9..md) They caused their children
to pass through the fire, in token of their dedicating them to their
idols. (10.) They used divinations and enchantments, that they might
receive directions from the gods to whom they paid their devotions.

III\. What means God used with them, to bring them off from their
idolatries, and to how little purpose. He testified against them, showed
them their sins and warned them of the fatal consequences of them by all
the prophets and all the seers (for so the prophets had been formerly
called), and pressed them to turn from their evil ways, [Kg2
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#013.md). We have read of prophets, more
or less, in every reign. Though they had forsaken God's family of
priests, he did not leave them without a succession of prophets, who
made it their business to teach them the good knowledge of the Lord, but
all in vain ([Kg2 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#014).md); they would
not hear, but hardened their necks, persisted in their idolatries, and
were like their fathers, that would not bow their necks to God's yoke,
because they did not believe in him, did not receive his truths, nor
would venture upon his promises: it seems to refer to their fathers in
the wilderness; the same sin that kept them out of Canaan turned these
out, and that was unbelief.

IV\. How God punished them for their sins. He was very angry with them
([Kg2 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#018).md); for, in the matter of
his worship, he is a jealous God, and resents nothing more deeply than
giving that honour to any creature which is due to himself only. He
afflicted them ([Kg2 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#020).md) and
delivered them into the hand of spoilers, in the days of the judges and
of Saul, and afterwards in the days of most of their kings, to see if
they would be awakened by the judgments of God to consider and amend
their ways; but, when all these corrections did not prevail to drive out
the folly, God first rent Israel from the house of David, under which
they might have been happy. As Judah was hereby weakened, so Israel was
hereby corrupted; for they made a man king who drove them from following
the Lord and caused them to sin a great sin, [Kg2
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#021.md). This was a national judgment,
and the punishment of their former idolatries; and, at length, he
removed them quite out of his sight ([Kg2
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#018.md), [Kg2
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#023).md), without giving them any hopes
of a return out of their captivity.

Lastly, Here is a complaint against Judah in the midst of all ([Kg2
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#019).md): Also Judah kept not the
commandments of God; though they were not as yet quite so bad as Israel,
yet they walked in the statutes of Israel; and this aggravated the sin
of Israel, that they communicated the infection of it to Judah; see [Eze
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#011.md). Those that bring sin into a
country or family bring a plague into it and will have to answer for all
the mischief that follows.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 17:24</span></span>

Never was land lost, we say, for want of an heir. When the children of
Israel were dispossessed, and turned out of Canaan, the king of Assyria
soon transplanted thither the supernumeraries of his own country, such
as it could well spare, who should be servants to him and masters to the
Israelites that remained; and here we have an account of these new
inhabitants, whose story is related here that we may take our leave of
Samaria, as also of the Israelites that were carried captive into
Assyria.

I. Concerning the Assyrians that were brought into the land of Israel we
are here told, 1. That they possessed Samaria and dwelt in the cities
thereof, [Kg2 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024.md). It is common for
lands to change their owners, but sad that the holy land should become a
heathen land again. See what work sin makes. 2. That at their first
coming God sent lions among them. They were probably insufficient to
people the country, which occasioned the beasts of the field to multiply
against them ([Exo 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#029).md); yet,
besides the natural cause, there was a manifest hand of God in it, who
is Lord of hosts, of all the creatures, and can serve his own purposes
by which he pleases, small or great, lice or lions. God ordered them
this rough welcome to check their pride and insolence, and to let them
know that though they had conquered Israel the God of Israel had power
enough to deal with them - that he could have prevented their settling
here, by ordering lions into the service of Israel, and that he
permitted it, not for their righteousness, but the wickedness of his own
people - and that they were now under his visitation. They had lived
without God in their own land, and were not plagued with lions; but, if
they do so in this land, it is at their peril. 3. That they sent a
remonstrance of this grievance to the king their master, setting forth,
it is likely, the loss their infant colony had sustained by the lions
and the continual fear they were in of them, and stating that they
looked upon it to be a judgment upon them for not worshipping the God of
the land, which they could not, because they knew not how, [Kg2
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#026.md). The God of Israel was the God
of the whole world, but they ignorantly call him the God of the land,
apprehending themselves therefore within his reach, and concerned to be
upon good terms with him. Herein they shamed the Israelites, who were
not so ready to hear the voice of God's judgments as they were, and who
had not served the God of that land, though he was the God of their
fathers and their great benefactor, and though they were well instructed
in the manner of his worship. Assyrians begged to be taught that which
Israelites hated to be taught. 4. That the king of Assyria took care to
have them taught the manner of the God of the land ([Kg2
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#027.md), [Kg2
17:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#028).md), not out of any affection to
that God, but to save his subjects from the lions. On this errand he
sent back one of the priests whom he had carried away captive. A prophet
would have done them more good, for this was but one of the priests of
the calves, and therefore chose to dwell at Bethel for old acquaintance'
sake, and, though he might teach them to do better than they did, he was
not likely to teach them to do well, unless he had taught his own people
better. However, he came and dwelt among them, to teach them how they
should fear the Lord. Whether he taught them out of the book of the law,
or only by word of mouth, is uncertain. 5. That, being thus taught, they
made a mongrel religion of it, worshipped the God of Israel for fear and
their own idols for love ([Kg2 17:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#033).md):
They feared the Lord, but they served their own gods. They all agreed to
worship the God of the land according to the manner, to serve the Jewish
festivals and rites of sacrificing, but every nation made gods of their
own besides, not only for their private use in their own families, but
to be put in the houses of their high places, [Kg2
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#009.md). The idols of each country are
here named, [Kg2 17:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#030.md), [Kg2
17:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#031.md). The learned are at a loss for
the signification of several of these names, and cannot agree by what
representations these gods were worshipped. If we may credit the
traditions of the Jewish doctors, they tell us that Succoth-Benoth was
worshipped in a hen and chickens, Nergal in a cock, Ashima in a smooth
goat, Nibhaz in a dog, Tartak in an ass, Adrammelech in a peacock,
Anammelech in a pheasant. Our own tell us, more probably, that
Succoth-Benoth (signifying the tents of the daughters) was Venus.
Nergal, being worshipped by the Cuthites, or Persians, was the fire,
Adrammelech and Anammelech were only distinctions of Moloch. See how
vain idolaters were in their imaginations, and wonder at their
sottishness. Our very ignorance concerning these idols teaches us the
accomplishment of that word which God has spoken, that these false gods
should all perish ([Jer 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#011).md); they
are all buried in oblivion, while the name of the true God shall
continue for ever. 6. This medley superstition is here said to continue
unto this day ([Kg2 17:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#041).md), till the
time when this book was written and long after, above 300 years in all,
till the time of Alexander the Great, when Manasse, brother to Jaddus
the high priest of the Jews, having married the daughter of Sanballat,
governor of the Samaritans, went over to them, got leave of Alexander to
build a temple in Mount Gerizim, drew over many of the Jews to him, and
prevailed with the Samaritans to cast away all their idols and to
worship the God of Israel only; yet their worship was mixed with so much
superstition that our Saviour told them they knew not what they
worshipped, [Joh 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#022.md).

II\. Concerning the Israelites that were carried into the land of
Assyria. This historian has occasion to speak of them ([Kg2
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#022).md), showing that their successors
in the land did as they had done (after the manner of the nations whom
they carried away), they worshipped both the God of Israel and those
other gods; but what did the captives do in the land of their
affliction? Were they reformed, and brought to repentance, by their
troubles? No, they did after the former manner, [Kg2
17:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#034.md). When the two tribes were
afterwards carried into Babylon, they were cured by it of their
idolatry, and therefore, after seventy years, they were brought back
with joy; but the ten tribes were hardened in the furnace, and therefore
were justly lost in it and left to perish. This obstinacy of theirs is
here aggravated by the consideration, 1. Of the honour God had put upon
them, as the seed of Jacob, whom he named Israel, and from him they were
so named, but were a reproach to that worthy name by which they were
called. 2. Of the covenant he made with them, and the charge he gave
them upon that covenant, which is here very fully recited, that they
should fear and serve the Lord Jehovah only, who had brought them up out
of Egypt ([Kg2 17:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#036).md), that, having
received his statutes and ordinances in writing, they should observe to
do them for evermore ([Kg2 17:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#037).md), and
never forget that covenant which God had made with them, the promises
and conditions of that covenant, especially that great article of it
which is here thrice repeated, because it had been so often inculcated
and so much insisted on, that they should not fear other gods. He had
told them that, if they kept close to him, he would deliver them out of
the hand of all their enemies ([Kg2
17:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#039).md); yet when they were in the hand
of their enemies, and stood in need of deliverance, they were so stupid,
and had so little sense of their own interest, that they did after the
former manner ([Kg2 17:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#040).md), they
served both the true God and false gods, as if they knew no difference.
Ephraim is joined to idols, let him alone. So they did, and so did the
nations that succeeded them. Well might the apostle ask, What then, Are
we better than they? No, in no wise, for both Jews and Gentiles are all
under sin, [Rom 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#009.md).
