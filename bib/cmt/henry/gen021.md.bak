### [Genesis Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 21:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have, I. Isaac, the child of promise born into
Abraham's family ([Gen 21:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#001).md). II.
Ishmael, the son of the bondwoman, cast out of it ([Gen
21:9-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#009).md). III. Abraham's league with
his neighbour Abimelech ([Gen
21:22-32](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#022).md). IV. His devotion to his God
([Gen 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#033).md).

[Genesis 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 21:1</span></span>

Long-looked-for comes at last. The vision concerning the promised seed
is for an appointed time, and now, at the end, it speaks, and does not
lie; few under the Old Testament were brought into the world with such
expectation as Isaac was, not for the sake of any great person eminence
at which he was to arrive, but because he was to be, in this very thin,
a type of Christ, that seed which the holy God had so long promised and
holy men so long expected. In this account of the first days of Isaac we
may observe,

I. The fulfilling of God's promise in the conception and birth of Isaac,
[Gen 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#001.md), [Gen
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#002.md). Note, God's providences look
best and brightest when they are compared with his word, and when we
observe how God, in them all, acts as he has said, as he has spoken. 1.
Isaac was born according to the promise. The Lord visited Sarah in
mercy, as he had said. Note, No word of God shall fall to the ground;
for he is faithful that has promised, and God's faithfulness is the stay
and support of his people's faith. He was born at the set time of which
God had spoken, [Gen 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#002.md). Note, God
is always punctual to his time; though his promised mercies come not at
the time we set, they will certainly come at the time he sets, and that
is the best time., 2. He was born by virtue of the promise: Sarah by
faith received strength to conceive [Heb
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#011.md). God therefore by promise gave
that strength. It was not by the power of common providence, but by the
power of a special promise, that Isaac was born. A sentence of death
was, as it were, passed upon the second causes: Abraham was old, and
Sarah old, and both as good as dead; and then the word of God took
place. Note, True believers, by virtue of God's promises, are enabled to
do that which is above the power of human nature, for by them they
partake of a divine nature, [Pe2 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004.md).

II\. Abraham's obedience to God's precept concerning Isaac.

1\. He named him, as God commanded him, [Gen
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#003.md). God directed him to a name for a
memorial, Isaac, laughter; and Abraham, whose office it was, gave him
that name, though he might have designed him some other name of a more
pompous signification. Note, It is fit that the luxuriancy of human
invention should always yield to the sovereignty and plainness of divine
institution; yet there was good reason for the name, for, (1.) When
Abraham received the promise of him he laughed for joy, [Gen
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#017.md). Note, When the sun of comfort
has risen upon the soul it is good to remember how welcome the dawning
of the day was, and with what exultation we embraced the promise. (2.)
When Sarah received the promise she laughed with distrust and
diffidence. Note, When God gives us the mercies we began to despair of
we ought to remember with sorrow and shame our sinful distrusts of God's
power and promise, when we were in pursuit of them. (3.) Isaac was
himself, afterwards, laughed at by Ishmael ([Gen
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#009).md), and perhaps his name bade him
expect it. Note, God's favourites are often the world's laughing-stocks.
(4.) The promise which he was not only the son, but the heir of, was to
be the joy of all the saints in all ages, and that which would fill
their mouths with laughter.

2\. He circumcised him, [Gen 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#004.md). The
covenant being established with him, the seal of the covenant was
administered to him; and though a bloody ordinance, and he a darling,
yet it must not be omitted, no, nor deferred beyond the eighth day. God
had kept time in performing the promise, and therefore Abraham must keep
time in obeying the precept.

III\. The impressions which this mercy made upon Sarah.

1\. It filled her with joy ([Gen
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#006).md): "God has made me to laugh; he
has given me both cause to rejoice and a heart to rejoice." Thus the
mother of our Lord, [Luk 1:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#046.md), [Luk
1:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#047). Note, (1..md) God bestows mercies
upon his people to encourage their joy in his work and service; and,
whatever is the matter of our joy, God must be acknowledged as the
author of it, unless it be the laughter of the fool. (2.) When mercies
have been long deferred they are the more welcome when they come. (3.)
It adds to the comfort of any mercy to have our friends rejoice with us
in it: All that hear will laugh with me; for laughing is catching. See
[Luk 1:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#058.md). Others would rejoice in
this instance of God's power and goodness, and be encouraged to trust in
him. See [Psa 119:74](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#074.md).

2\. It filled her with wonder, [Gen
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#007). Observe here, (1..md) What it was
she thought so wonderful: That Sarah should give children suck, that she
should, not only bear a child, but be so strong and hearty at the age as
to give it suck. Note, Mothers, if they be able, ought to be nurses to
their own children. Sarah was a person of quality, was aged; nursing
might be thought prejudicial of herself, or to the child, or to both;
she had choice of nurses, no doubt, in her own family: and yet she would
do her duty in this matter; and her daughters the good wives are while
they thus do well, [Pe1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#005.md), [Pe1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#006.md). See [Lam
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#003). (2..md) How she expressed her
wonder: "Who would have said it? The thing was so highly improbable, so
near to impossible, that if any one but God had said it we could not
have believed it." Note, God's favours to his covenant-people are such
as surpass both their own and others' thoughts and expectations. Who
could imagine that God should do so much for those that deserve so
little, nay, for those that deserve so ill? See [Eph
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020.md); [Sa2
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#018.md), [Sa2
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#019.md). Who would have said that God
should send his Son to die for us, his Spirit to sanctify us, his angels
to attend us? Who would have said that such great sins should be
pardoned, such mean services accepted, and such worthless worms taken
into covenant and communion with the great and holy God?

IV\. A short account of Isaac's infancy: The child grew, [Gen
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#008.md). Special notice is taken of this,
though a thing of course, to intimate that the children of the promise
are growing children. See [Luk 1:80](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#080.md);
[Luk 2:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#040.md). Those that are born of God
shall increase of God, [Col 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#019.md). He
grew so as not always to need milk, but was able to bear strong meat,
and then he was weaned. See [Heb 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#013.md),
[Heb 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#014.md). And then it was that
Abraham made a great feast for his friends and neighbours, in
thankfulness to God for his mercy to him. He made this feast, not on the
day that Isaac was born, that would have been too great a disturbance to
Sarah; nor on the day that he was circumcised, that would have been too
great a diversion from the ordinance; but on the day that he was weaned,
because God's blessing upon the nursing of children, and the
preservation of them throughout the perils of the infant age, are signal
instances of the care and tenderness of the divine providence, which
ought to be acknowledged, to its praise. See [Psa
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#009.md), [Psa
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#010.md); [Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md).

[Genesis 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 21:9</span></span>

The casting out of Ishmael is here considered of, and resolved on.

I. Ishmael himself gave the occasion by some affronts he gave to Isaac
his little brother, some think on the day that Abraham made the feast
for joy that Isaac was safely weaned, which the Jews say was not till he
was three years old, others say five. Sarah herself was an eye-witness
of the abuse: she saw the son of the Egyptian mocking ([Gen
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#009).md), mocking Isaac, no doubt, for it
is said, with reference to this ([Gal
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#029).md), that he that was born after the
flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit. Ishmael is here
called the son of the Egyptian, because, as some think, the 400 years'
affliction of the seed of Abraham by the Egyptians began now, and was to
be dated hence, [Gen 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013.md). She saw
him playing with Isaac, so the Septuagint, and, in play, mocking him.
Ishmael was fourteen years older than Isaac; and, when children are
together, the elder should be careful and tender of the younger: but it
argued a very base and sordid disposition in Ishmael to be abusive to a
child that was no way a match for him. Note, 1. God takes notice of what
children say and do in their play, and will reckon with them if they say
or do amiss, though their parents do not. 2. Mocking is a great sin, and
very provoking to God. 3. There is a rooted remaining enmity in the seed
of the serpent against the seed of the woman. The children of promise
must expect to be mocked. This is persecution, which those that will
live godly must count upon. 4. None are rejected and cast out from God
but those who have first deserved it. Ishmael is continued in Abraham's
family till he becomes a disturbance, grief, and scandal to it.

II\. Sarah made the motion: Cast out this bond-woman, [Gen
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#010.md). This seems to be spoken in some
heat, yet it is quoted ([Gal 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#030).md) as
if it had been spoken by a spirit of prophecy; and it is the sentence
passed on all hypocrites and carnal people, though they have a place and
a name in the visible church. All that are born after the flesh and not
born again, that rest in the law and reject the gospel promise, shall
certainly be cast out. It is made to point particularly at the rejection
of the unbelieving Jews, who, though they were the seed of Abraham, yet,
because they submitted not to the gospel covenant, were unchurched and
disfranchised: and that which, above any thing, provoked God to cast
them off was their mocking and persecuting the gospel church, God's
Isaac, in its infancy, [Th1 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016.md),
Note, There are many who are familiarly conversant with the children of
God in this world, and yet shall not partake with them in the
inheritance of sons. Ishmael might be Isaac's play-fellow and
school-fellow, yet not his fellow-heir.

III\. Abraham was averse to it: The thing was very grievous in Abraham's
sight, [Gen 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#011.md). 1. It grieved him
that Ishmael had given such a provocation. Note, Children ought to
consider that the more their parents love them the more they are grieved
at their misconduct, and particularly at their quarrels among
themselves. 2. It grieved him that Sarah insisted upon such a
punishment. "Might it not suffice to correct him? would nothing less
serve than to expel him?" Note, Even the needful extremities which must
be used with wicked and incorrigible children are very grievous to
tender parents, who cannot thus afflict willingly.

IV\. God determined it, [Gen 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012.md),
[Gen 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#013.md). We may well suppose
Abraham to be greatly agitated about this matter, loth to displease
Sarah, and yet loth to expel Ishmael; in this difficulty God tells him
what his will is, and then he is satisfied. Note, A good man desires no
more in doubtful cases than to know his duty, and what God would have
him do; and, when he is clear in this, he is, or should be, easy. To
make Abraham so, God sets this matter before him in a true light, and
shows him, 1. That the casting out of Ishmael was necessary to the
establishment of Isaac in the rights and privileges of the covenant: In
Isaac shall thy seed be called. Both Christ and the church must descend
from Abraham through the loins of Isaac; this is the entail of the
promise upon Isaac, and is quoted by the apostle ([Rom
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#007).md) to show that not all who come
from Abraham's loins were the heirs of Abraham's covenant. Isaac, the
promised son, must be the father of the promised seed; therefore, "Away
with Ishmael, send him far enough, lest he corrupt the manners or
attempt to invade the rights of Isaac." It will be his security to have
his rival banished. The covenant seed of Abraham must be a peculiar
people, a people by themselves, from the very first, distinguished, not
mingled with those that were out of covenant; for this reason Ishmael
must be separated. Abraham was called alone, and so must Isaac be. See
[Isa 51:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#002.md). It is probable that Sarah
little thought of this ([Joh 11:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#051).md),
but God took what she said, and turned it into an oracle, as afterwards,
[Gen 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#010.md). 2. That the casting out of
Ishmael should not be his ruin, [Gen
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#013.md). He shall be a nation, because
he is thy seed. We are not sure that it was his eternal ruin. It is
presumption to say that all those who are left out of the external
dispensation from all his mercies: those may be saved who are not thus
honoured. However, we are sure it was not his temporal ruin. Though he
was chased out of the church, he was not chased out of the world. I will
make him a nation. Note, (1.) Nations are of God's making: he founds
them, he forms them, he fixes them. (2.) Many are full of the blessings
of God's providence that are strangers to the blessings of his covenant.
(3.) The children of this world often fare the better, as to outward
things, for their relation to the children of God.

[Genesis 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 21:14</span></span>

Here is, I. The casting out of the bond-woman, and her son from the
family of Abraham, [Gen 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#014.md).
Abraham's obedience to the divine command in this matter was speedy -
early in the morning, we may suppose immediately after he had, in the
night's visions, received orders to do this. It was also submissive; it
was contrary to his judgment, at least to his own inclination, to do it;
yet as soon as he perceives that it is the mind of God he makes no
objections, but silently does as he is bidden, as one trained up to an
implicit obedience. In sending them away without any attendants, on
foot, and slenderly provided for, it is probable that he observed the
directions given him. If Hagar and Ishmael had conducted themselves well
in Abraham's family, they might have continued there; but they threw
themselves out by their own pride and insolence, which were thus justly
chastised. Note, By abusing our privileges we forfeit them. Those that
know not when they are well off, in such a desirable place as Abraham's
family, deserve to be cashiered, and to be made to know the worth of
mercies by the want of them.

II\. Their wandering in the wilderness, missing their way to the place
Abraham designed them for a settlement.

1\. They were reduced to great distress there. Their provisions were
spent, and Ishmael was sick. He that used to be full fed in Abraham's
house, where he waxed fat and kicked, now fainted and sunk, when he was
brought to short allowance. Hagar is in tears, and sufficiently
mortified. Now she wishes for the crumbs she had wasted and made light
of at her master's table. Like one under the power of the spirit of
bondage, she despairs of relief, counts upon nothing but the death of
the child ([Gen 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#015.md), [Gen
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#016).md), though God had told her,
before he was born, that he should live to be a man, a great man. We are
apt to forget former promises, when present providences seem to
contradict them; for we live by sense.

2\. In this distress, God graciously appeared for their relief: he heard
the voice of the lad, [Gen 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#017.md). We
read not of a word he said; but his sighs, and groans, and calamitous
state, cried aloud in the ears of mercy. An angel was sent to comfort
Hagar, and it was not the first time that she had met with God's
comforts in a wilderness; she had thankfully acknowledged the former
kind visit which God made his in such a case ([Gen
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#013).md), and therefore God now visited
her again with seasonable succours. (1.) The angel assures her of the
cognizance God took of her distress: God has heard the voice of the lad
where he is, though he is in a wilderness (for, wherever we are, there
is a way open heaven-ward); therefore lift up the lad, and hold him in
thy hand, [Gen 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#018.md). Note, God's
readiness to help us when we are in trouble must not slacken, but
quicken, our endeavours to help ourselves. (2.) He repeats the promise
concerning her son, that he should be a great nation, as a reason why
she should bestir herself to help him. Note, It should engage our care
and pains about children and young people to consider that we know not
what God has designed them for, nor what great use Providence may make
of them. (3.) He directs her to a present supply ([Gen
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#019).md): He opened her eyes (which were
swollen and almost blinded with weeping), and then she saw a well of
water. Note, Many that have reason enough to be comforted go mourning
from day to day, because they do not see the reason they have for
comfort. There is a well of water by them in the covenant of grace, but
they are not aware of it; they have not the benefit of it, till the same
God that opened their eyes to see their wound opens them to see their
remedy, [Joh 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#006.md), [Joh
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007.md). Now the apostle tells us that
those things concerning Hagar and Ishmael are allegoroumena ([Gal
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#024).md), they are to be allegorized;
this then will serve to illustrate the folly, \[1.\] Of those who, like
the unbelieving Jews, seek for righteousness by the law and the carnal
ordinances of it, and not by the promise made in Christ, thereby running
themselves into a wilderness of want and despair. Their comforts are
soon exhausted, and if God save them not by his special prerogative, and
by a miracle of mercy open their eyes and undeceive them, they are
undone. \[2.\] Of those who seek for satisfaction and happiness in the
world and the things of it. Those that forsake the comforts of the
covenant and communion with God, and choose their portion in this earth,
take up with a bottle of water, poor and slender provision, and that
soon spent; they wander endlessly in pursuit of satisfaction, and, at
length, sit down short of it.

III\. The settlement of Ishmael, at last, in the wilderness of Paran
([Gen 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#020.md), [Gen
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#021).md), a wild place, fittest for a
wild man; and such a one he was, ch. 16. 12. Those that are born after
the flesh take up with the wilderness of this world, while the children
of the promise aim at the heavenly Canaan, and cannot be at rest till
they are there. Observe, 1. He had some tokens of God's presence: God
was with the lad; his outward prosperity was owing to this. 2. By trade
he was an archer, which intimates that craft was his excellency and
sport his business: rejected Esau was a cunning hunter. 3. He matched
among his mother's relations; she took him a wife out of Egypt: as great
an archer as he was, he did not think he could take his aim well, in the
business of marriage, if he proceeded without his mother's advice and
consent.

[Genesis 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 21:22</span></span>

We have here an account of the treaty between Abimelech and Abraham, in
which appears the accomplishment of that promise ([Gen
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002).md) that God would make his name
great. His friendship is valued, is courted, though a stranger, though a
tenant at will to the Canaanites and Perizzites.

I. The league is proposed by Abimelech, and Phichol his prime-minister
of state and general of his army.

1\. The inducement to it was God's favour to Abraham ([Gen
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#022).md): "God is with thee in all that
thou doest, and we cannot but take notice of it." Note, (1.) God in his
providence sometimes shows his people such tokens for good that their
neighbours cannot but take notice of it, [Psa
86:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#017.md). Their affairs do so visibly
prosper, and they have such remarkable success in their undertakings,
that a confession is extorted from all about them of God's presence with
them. (2.) It is good being in favour with those that are in favour with
God, and having an interest in those that have an interest in heaven,
[Zac 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#023.md). We will go with you, for we
have heard that God is with you. We do well for ourselves if we have
fellowship with those that have fellowship with God, [Jo1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003.md).

2\. The tenour of it was, in general, that there should be a firm and
constant friendship between the two families, which should not upon any
account be violated. This bond of friendship must be strengthened by the
bond of an oath, in which the true God was appealed to, both as a
witness of their sincerity and an avenger in case either side were
treacherous, [Gen 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#023). Observe, (1..md)
He desires the entail of this league upon his posterity and the
extension of it to his people. He would have his son, and his son's son,
and his land likewise, to have the benefit of it. Good men should secure
an alliance and communion with the favourites of Heaven, not for
themselves only, but for theirs also. (2.) He reminds Abraham of the
fair treatment he had found among them: According to the kindness I have
done unto thee. As those that have received kindness must return it, so
those that have shown kindness may expect it.

II\. It is consented to by Abraham, with a particular clause inserted
about a well. In Abraham's part of this transaction observe,

1\. He was ready to enter into this league with Abimelech, finding him
to be a man of honour and conscience, and that had the fear of God
before his eyes: I will swear, [Gen
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#024). Note, (1..md) Religion does not
make men morose and unconversable; I am sure it ought not. We must not,
under colour of shunning bad company, be sour to all company, and
jealous of every body. (2.) An honest mind does not startle at giving
assurances: if Abraham say that he will be true to Abimelech, he is not
afraid to swear it; an oath is for confirmation.

2\. He prudently settled the matter concerning a well, about which
Abimelech's servants had quarrelled with him. Wells of water, it seems,
were choice goods in that country: thanks be to God, that they are not
so scarce in ours. (1.) Abraham mildly told Abimelech of it, [Gen
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#025.md). Note, If our brother trespass
against us, we must, with the meekness of wisdom, tell him his fault,
that the matter may be fairly accommodated and an end made of it, [Mat
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#015). (2..md) He acquiesced in
Abimelech's justification of himself in this matter: I wot not who has
done this thing, [Gen 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#026.md). Many are
suspected of injustice and unkindness that are perfectly innocent, and
we ought to be glad when they clear themselves. The faults of servants
must not be imputed to their masters, unless they know of them and
justify them; and no more can be expected from an honest man than that
he be ready to do right as soon as he knows that he has done wrong. (3.)
He took care to have his title to the well cleared and confirmed, to
prevent any disputes or quarrels for the future, [Gen
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#030.md). It is justice, as well as
wisdom, to do thus, in perptuam rei memoriam - that the circumstance may
be perpetually remembered.

3\. He made a very handsome present to Abimelech, [Gen
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#027.md). It was not any thing curious or
fine that he presented to him, but that which was valuable and useful -
sheep and oxen, in gratitude for Abimelech's kindness to him, and in
token of hearty friendship between them. The interchanging of kind
offices is the improving of love: that which is mine is my friend's.

4\. He ratified the covenant by an oath, and registered it by giving a
new name to the place ([Gen 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#031).md),
Beer-sheba, the well of the oath, in remembrance of the covenant they
swore to, that they might be ever mindful of it; or the well of seven,
in remembrance of the seven lambs given to Abimelech, as a consideration
for his confirming Abraham's title to that well. Note, Bargains made
must be remembered, that we may make them good, and may not break our
word through oversight.

Observe, 1. Abraham, having got into a good neighbourhood, knew when he
was well off, and continued a great while there. There he planted a
grove for a shade to his tent, or perhaps an orchard of fruit-trees; and
there, though we cannot say he settled, for God would have him, while he
lived, to be a stranger and a pilgrim, yet he sojourned many days, as
many as would consist with his character, as Abraham the Hebrew, or
passenger. 2. There he made, not only a constant practice, but an open
profession, of his religion: There he called on the name of the Lord,
the everlasting God, probably in the grove he planted, which was his
oratory or house of prayer. Christ prayed in a garden, on a mountain.
(1.) Abraham kept up public worship, to which, probably, his neighbours
resorted, that they might join with him. Note, Good men should not only
retain their goodness wherever they go, but do all they can to propagate
it, and make others good. (2.) In calling on the Lord, we must eye him
as the everlasting God, the God of the world, so some. Though God had
made himself known to Abraham as his God in particular, and in covenant
with him, yet he forgets not to give glory to him as the Lord of all:
The everlasting God, who was, before all worlds, and will be, when time
and days shall be no more. See [Isa
40:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#028.md).
