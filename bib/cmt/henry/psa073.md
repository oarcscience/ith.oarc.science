### [Psalms Chapter 73](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 73:0</span></span>

This psalm, and the ten that next follow it, carry the name of Asaph in
the titles of them. If he was the penman of them (as many think), we
rightly call them psalms of Asaph. If he was only the chief musician, to
whom they were delivered, our marginal reading is right, which calls
them psalms for Asaph. It is probable that he penned them; for we read
of the words of David and of Asaph the seer, which were used in praising
God in Hezekiah's time, [Ch2 29:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#030.md).
Though the Spirit of prophecy by sacred songs descended chiefly on
David, who is therefore styled "the sweet psalmist of Israel," yet God
put some of that Spirit upon those about him. This is a psalm of great
use; it gives us an account of the conflict which the psalmist had with
a strong temptation to envy the prosperity of wicked people. He begins
his account with a sacred principle, which he held fast, and by the help
of which he kept his ground and carried his point ([Psa
73:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001).md). He then tells us, I. How he got
into the temptation ([Psa 73:2-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#002).md).
II. How he got out of the temptation and gained a victory over it ([Psa
73:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#015).md). III. How he got by the
temptation and was the better for it ([Psa
73:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#021).md). If, in singing this psalm,
we fortify ourselves against the life temptation, we do not use it in
vain. The experiences of others should be our instructions.

A psalm of Asaph.

[Psalms 73:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 73:1</span></span>

This psalm begins somewhat abruptly: Yet God is good to Israel (so the
margin reads it); he had been thinking of the prosperity of the wicked;
while he was thus musing the fire burned, and at last he spoke by way of
check to himself for what he had been thinking of. "However it be, yet
God is good." Though wicked people receive many of the gifts of his
providential bounty, yet we must own that he is, in a peculiar manner,
good to Israel; they have favours from him which others have not.

The psalmist designs an account of a temptation he was strongly
assaulted with - to envy the prosperity of the wicked, a common
temptation, which has tried the graces of many of the saints. Now in
this account,

I. He lays down, in the first place, that great principle which he is
resolved to abide by and not to quit while he was parleying with this
temptation, [Psa 73:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001.md). Job, when he
was entering into such a temptation, fixed for his principle the
omniscience of God: Times are not hidden from the Almighty, [Job
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#001.md). Jeremiah's principle is the
justice of God: Righteous art thou, O God! when I plead with thee, [Jer
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001.md). Habakkuk's principle is the
holiness of God: Thou art of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, [Hab
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#013.md). The psalmist's, here, is the
goodness of God. These are truths which cannot be shaken and which we
must resolve to live and die by. Though we may not be able to reconcile
all the disposals of Providence with them, we must believe they are
reconcilable. Note, Good thoughts of God will fortify us against many of
Satan's temptations. Truly God is good; he had had many thoughts in his
mind concerning the providences of God, but this word, at last, settled
him: "For all this, God is good, good to Israel, even to those that are
of a clean heart." Note, 1. Those are the Israel of God that are of a
clean heart, purified by the blood of Christ, cleansed from the
pollutions of sin, and entirely devoted to the glory of God. An upright
heart is a clean heart; cleanness is truth in the inward part. 2. God,
who is good to all, is in a special manner good to his church and
people, as he was to Israel of old. God was good to Israel in redeeming
them out of Egypt, taking them into covenant with himself, giving them
his laws and ordinances, and in the various providences that related to
them; he is, in like manner, good to all those that are of a clean
heart, and, whatever happens, we must not think otherwise.

II\. He comes now to relate the shock that was given to his faith in
God's distinguishing goodness to Israel by a strong temptation to envy
the prosperity of the wicked, and therefore to think that the Israel of
God are no happier than other people and that God is no kinder to them
than to others.

1\. He speaks of it as a very narrow escape that he had not been quite
foiled and overthrown by this temptation ([Psa
73:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#002).md): "But as for me, though I was so
well satisfied in the goodness of God to Israel, yet my feet were almost
gone (the tempter had almost tripped up my heels), my steps had
well-nigh slipped (I had like to have quitted my religion, and given up
all my expectations of benefit by it); for I was envious at the
foolish." Note, 1. The faith even of strong believers may sometimes be
sorely shaken and ready to fail them. There are storms that will try the
firmest anchors. 2. Those that shall never be quite undone are sometimes
very near it, and, in their own apprehension, as good as gone. Many a
precious soul, that shall live for ever, had once a very narrow turn for
its life; almost and well-nigh ruined, but a step between it and fatal
apostasy, and yet snatched as a brand out of the burning, which will for
ever magnify the riches of divine grace in the nations of those that are
saved. Now,

2\. Let us take notice of the process of the psalmist's temptation, what
he was tempted with and tempted to.

(1.) He observed that foolish wicked people have sometimes a very great
share of outward prosperity. He saw, with grief, the prosperity of the
wicked, [Psa 73:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#003.md). Wicked people are
really foolish people, and act against reason and their true interest,
and yet every stander-by sees their prosperity. \[1.\] They seem to have
the least share of the troubles and calamities of this life ([Psa
73:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#005).md): They are not in the troubles of
other men, even of wise and good men, neither are they plagued like
other men, but seem as if by some special privilege they were exempted
from the common lot of sorrows. If they meet with some little trouble,
it is nothing to what others endure that are less sinners and yet
greater sufferers. \[2.\] They seem to have the greatest share of the
comforts of this life. They live at ease, and bathe themselves in
pleasures, so that their eyes stand out with fatness, [Psa
73:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#007.md). See what the excess of pleasure
is; the moderate use of it enlightens the eyes, but those that indulge
themselves inordinately in the delights of sense have their eyes ready
to start out of their heads. Epicures are really their own tormentors,
by putting a force upon nature, while they pretend to gratify it. And
well may those feed themselves to the full who have more than heart
could wish, more than they themselves ever thought of or expected to be
masters of. They have, at least, more than a humble, quiet, contented
heart could wish, yet not so much as they themselves wish for. There are
many who have a great deal of this life in their hands, but nothing of
the other life in their hearts. They are ungodly, live without the fear
and worship of God, and yet they prosper and get on in the world, and
not only are rich, but increase in riches, [Psa
73:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#012.md). They are looked upon as
thriving men; while others have much ado to keep what they have, they
are still adding more, more honour, power, pleasure, by increasing in
riches. They are the prosperous of the age, so some read it. \[3.\]
Their end seems to be peace. This is mentioned first, as the most
strange of all, for peace in death was every thought to be the peculiar
privilege of the godly ([Psa 37:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#037).md),
yet, to outward appearance, it is often the lot of the ungodly ([Psa
73:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#004).md): There are no bands in their
death. They are not taken off by a violent death; they are foolish, and
yet die not as fools die; for their hands are not bound nor their feet
put into fetters, [Sa2 3:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#033.md), [Sa2
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#034.md). They are not taken off by an
untimely death, like the fruit forced from the tree before it is ripe,
but are left to hang on, till, through old age, they gently drop of
themselves. They do not die of sore and painful diseases: There are no
pangs, no agonies, in their death, but their strength is firm to the
last, so that they scarcely feel themselves die. They are of those who
die in their full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet, not of those
that die in the bitterness of their souls and never eat with pleasure,
[Job 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#023.md), [Job
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#025.md). Nay, they are not bound by the
terrors of conscience in their dying moments; they are not frightened
either with the remembrance of their sins or the prospect of their
misery, but die securely. We cannot judge of men's state on the other
side death either by the manner of their death or the frame of their
spirits in dying. Men may die like lambs, and yet have their place with
the goats.

(2.) He observed that they made a very bad use of their outward
prosperity and were hardened by it in their wickedness, which very much
strengthened the temptation he was in to fret at it. If it had done them
any good, if it had made them less provoking to God or less oppressive
to man, it would never have vexed him; but it had quite a contrary
effect upon them. \[1.\] It made them very proud and haughty. Because
they live at ease, pride compasses them as a chain, [Psa
73:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#006.md). They show themselves (to all
that see them) to be puffed up with their prosperity, as men show their
ornaments. The pride of Israel testifies to his face, [Hos
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#005.md); [Isa
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#009.md). Pride ties on their chain, or
necklace; so Dr. Hammond reads it. It is no harm to wear a chain or
necklace; but when pride ties it on, when it is worn to gratify a vain
mind, it ceases to be an ornament. It is not so much what the dress or
apparel is (though we have rules for that, [Ti1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009).md) as what principle ties it on and
with what spirit it is worn. And, as the pride of sinners appears in
their dress, so it does in their talk: They speak loftily ([Psa
73:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#008).md); they affect great swelling
words of vanity ([Pe2 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018).md), bragging
of themselves and disdaining all about them. Out of the abundance of the
pride that is in their heart they speak big. \[1.\] It made them
oppressive to their poor neighbours ([Psa
73:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#006).md): Violence covers them as a
garment. What they have got by fraud and oppression they keep and
increase by the same wicked methods, and care not what injury they do to
others, nor what violence they use, so they may but enrich and
aggrandize themselves. They are corrupt, like the giants, the sinners of
the old world, when the earth was filled with violence, [Gen
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#011.md), [Gen
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#013.md). They care not what mischief they
do, either for mischief-sake or for their own advantage-sake. They speak
wickedly concerning oppression; they oppress, and justify themselves in
it. Those that speak well of sin speak wickedly of it. They are corrupt,
that is, dissolved in pleasures and every thing that is luxurious (so
some), and then they deride and speak maliciously; they care not whom
they wound with the poisoned darts of calumny; from on high they speak
oppression. \[3.\] It made them very insolent in their demeanour towards
both God and man ([Psa 73:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#009).md): They set
their mouth against the heavens, putting contempt upon God himself and
his honour, bidding defiance to him and his power and justice. They
cannot reach the heavens with their hands, to shake God's throne, else
they would; but they show their ill-will by setting their mouth against
the heavens. Their tongue also walks through the earth, and they take
liberty to abuse all that come in their way. No man's greatness or
goodness can secure him from the scourge of the virulent tongue. They
take a pride and pleasure in bantering all mankind; they are pests of
the country, for they neither fear God nor regard man. \[4.\] In all
this they were very atheistical and profane. They could not have been
thus wicked if they had not learned to say ([Psa
73:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#011).md), How doth God know? And is
there knowledge in the Most High? So far were they from desiring the
knowledge of God, who gave them all the good things they had and would
have taught them to use them well, that they were not willing to believe
God had any knowledge of them, that he took any notice of their
wickedness or would ever call them to an account. As if, because he is
Most High, he could not or would not see them, [Job
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#012.md), [Job
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#013.md). Whereas because he is Most High
therefore he can, and will, take cognizance of all the children of men
and of all they do, or say, or think. What an affront is it to the God
of infinite knowledge, from whom all knowledge is, to ask, Is there
knowledge in him? Well may he say ([Psa
73:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#012).md), Behold, these are the ungodly.

(3.) He observed that while wicked men thus prospered in their impiety,
and were made more impious by their prosperity, good people were in
great affliction, and he himself in particular, which very much
strengthened the temptation he was in to quarrel with Providence. \[1.\]
He looked abroad and saw many of God's people greatly at a loss ([Psa
73:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#010).md): "Because the wicked are so
very daring therefore his people return hither; they are at the same
pause, the same plunge, that I am at; they know not what to say to it
any more than I do, and the rather because waters of a full cup are
wrung out to them; they are not only made to drink, and to drink deeply,
of the bitter cup of affliction, but to drink all. Care is taken that
they lose not a drop of that unpleasant potion; the waters are wrung out
unto them, that they may have the dregs of the cup. They pour out
abundance of tears when they hear wicked people blaspheme God and speak
profanely," as David did, [Psa
119:136](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#136.md). These are the waters wrung
out to them. \[2.\] He looked at home, and felt himself under the
continual frowns of Providence, while the wicked were sunning themselves
in its smiles ([Psa 73:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#014).md): "For my
part," says he, "all the day long have I been plagued with one
affliction or another, and chastened every morning, as duly as the
morning comes." His afflictions were great - he was chastened and
plagued; the returns of them were constant, every morning with the
morning, and they continued, without intermission, all the day long.
This he thought was very hard, that, when those who blasphemed God were
in prosperity, he that worshipped God was under such great affliction.
He spoke feelingly when he spoke of his own troubles; there is no
disputing against sense, except by faith.

(4.) From all this arose a very strong temptation to cast off his
religion. \[1.\] Some that observed the prosperity of the wicked,
especially comparing it with the afflictions of the righteous, were
tempted to deny a providence and to think that God had forsaken the
earth. In this sense some take [Psa
73:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#011.md). There are those, even among
God's professing people, that say, "How does God know? Surely all things
are left to blind fortune, and not disposed of by an all-seeing God."
Some of the heathen, upon such a remark as this, have asked, Quis putet
esse deos? - Who will believe that there are gods? \[2.\] Though the
psalmist's feet were not so far gone as to question God's omniscience,
yet he was tempted to question the benefit of religion, and to say ([Psa
73:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#013).md), Verily, I have cleansed my
heart in vain, and have, to no purpose, washed my hands in innocency.
See here what it is to be religious; it is to cleanse our hearts, in the
first place, by repentance and regeneration, and then to wash our hands
in innocency by a universal reformation of our lives. It is not in vain
to do this, not in vain to serve God and keep his ordinances; but good
men have been sometimes tempted to say, "It is in vain," and "Religion
is a thing that there is nothing to be got by," because they see wicked
people in prosperity. But, however the thing may appear now, when the
pure in heart, those blessed ones, shall see God ([Mat
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#008).md), they will not say that they
cleansed their hearts in vain.

[Psalms 73:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 73:15</span></span>

We have seen what a strong temptation the psalmist was in to envy
prospering profaneness; now here we are told how he kept his footing and
got the victory.

I. He kept up a respect for God's people, and with that he restrained
himself from speaking what he had thought amiss, [Psa
73:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#015.md). He got the victory by degrees,
and this was the first point he gained; he was ready to say, Verily, I
have cleansed my heart in vain, and thought he had reason to say it, but
he kept his mouth with this consideration, "If I say, I will speak thus,
behold, I should myself revolt and apostatize from, and so give the
greatest offence imaginable to, the generation of thy children." Observe
here, 1. Though he thought amiss, he took care not to utter that evil
thought which he had conceived. Note, It is bad to think ill, but it is
worse to speak it, for that is giving the evil thought an imprimatur - a
sanction; it is allowing it, giving consent to it, and publishing it for
the infection of others. But it is a good sign that we repent of the
evil imagination of the heart if we suppress it, and the error remains
with ourselves. If therefore thou hast been so foolish as to think evil,
be so wise as to lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and let it go no further,
[Pro 30:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#032.md). If I say, I will speak
thus. Observe, Though his corrupt heart made this inference from the
prosperity of the wicked, yet he did not mention it to those whether it
were fit to be mentioned or no. Note, We must think twice before we
speak once, both because some things may be thought which yet may not be
spoken and because the second thoughts may correct the mistakes of the
first. 2. The reason why he would not speak it was for fear of giving
offence to those whom God owned for his children. Note, (1.) There are a
people in the world that are the generation of God's children, a set of
men that hear and love God as their Father. (2.) We must be very careful
not to say or do any thing which may justly offend any of these little
ones ([Mat 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#006).md), especially which may
offend the generation of them, may sadden their hearts, or weaken their
hands, or shake their interest. (3.) There is nothing that can give more
general offence to the generation of God's children than to say that we
have cleansed our heart in vain or that it is vain to serve God; for
there is nothing more contrary to their universal sentiment and
experience nor any thing that grieves them more than to hear God thus
reflected on. (4.) Those that wish themselves in the condition of the
wicked do in effect quit the tents of God's children.

II\. He foresaw the ruin of wicked people. By this he baffled the
temptation, as by the former he gave some check to it. Because he durst
not speak what he had thought, for fear of giving offence, he began to
consider whether he had any good reason for that thought ([Psa
73:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#016).md): "I endeavoured to understand
the meaning of this unaccountable dispensation of Providence; but it was
too painful for me. I could not conquer it by the strength of my own
reasoning." It is a problem, not to be solved by the mere light of
nature, for, if there were not another life after this, we could not
fully reconcile the prosperity of the wicked with the justice of God.
But ([Psa 73:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#017).md) he went into the
sanctuary of God; he applied to his devotions, meditated upon the
attributes of God, and the things revealed, which belong to us and to
our children; he consulted the scriptures, and the lips of the priests
who attended the sanctuary; he prayed to God to make this matter plain
to him and to help him over this difficulty; and, at length, he
understood the wretched end of wicked people, which he plainly foresaw
to be such that even in the height of their prosperity they were rather
to be pitied than envied, for they were but ripening for ruin. Note,
There are many great things, and things needful to be known, which will
not be known otherwise than by going into the sanctuary of God, by the
word and prayer. The sanctuary must therefore be the resort of a tempted
soul. Note, further, We must judge of persons and things as they appear
by the light of divine revelation, and then we shall judge righteous
judgment; particularly we must judge by the end. All is well that ends
well, everlastingly well; but nothing well that ends ill, everlastingly
ill. The righteous man's afflictions end in peace, and therefore he is
happy; the wicked man's enjoyments end in destruction, and therefore he
is miserable.

1\. The prosperity of the wicked is short and uncertain. The high places
in which Providence sets them are slippery places ([Psa
73:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#018).md), where they cannot long keep
footing; but, when they offer to climb higher, that very attempt will be
the occasion of their sliding and falling. Their prosperity has no firm
ground; it is not built upon God's favour or his promise; and they have
not the satisfaction of feeling that it rests on firm ground.

2\. Their destruction is sure, and sudden, and very great. This cannot
be meant of any temporal destruction; for they were supposed to spend
all their days in wealth and their death itself had no bands in it: In a
moment they go down to the grace, so that even that could scarcely be
called their destruction; it must therefore be meant of eternal
destruction on the other side death - hell and destruction. They
flourish for a time, but are undone for ever. (1.) Their ruin is sure
and inevitable. He speaks of it as a thing done - They are cast down;
for their destruction is as certain as if it were already accomplished.
He speaks of it as God's doing, and therefore it cannot be resisted:
Thou castest them down. It is destruction from the Almighty ([Joe
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#015).md), from the glory of his power,
[Th2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009.md). Who can support those whom
God will cast down, on whom God will lay burdens? (2.) It is swift and
sudden; their damnation slumbers not; for how are they brought into
desolation as in a moment! [Psa 73:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#019.md).
It is easily effected, and will be a great surprise to themselves and
all about them. (3.) It is severe and very dreadful. It is a total and
final ruin: They are utterly consumed with terrors, It is the misery of
the damned that the terrors of the Almighty, whom they have made their
enemy, fasten upon their guilty consciences, which can neither shelter
themselves from them nor strengthen themselves under them; and therefore
not their being, but their bliss, must needs be utterly consumed by
them; not the least degree of comfort or hope remains to them; the
higher they were lifted up in their prosperity the sorer will their fall
be when they are cast down into destructions (for the word is plural)
and suddenly brought into desolation.

3\. Their prosperity is therefore not to be envied at all, but despised
rather, quod erat demonstrandum - which was the point to be established,
[Psa 73:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#020.md). As a dream when one
awaketh, so, O Lord! when thou awakest, or when they awake (as some read
it), thou shalt despise their image, their shadow, and make it to
vanish. In the day of the great judgment (so the Chaldee paraphrase
reads it), when they are awaked out of their graves, thou shalt, in
wrath, despise their image; for they shall rise to shame and everlasting
contempt. See here, (1.) What their prosperity now is; it is but an
image, a vain show, a fashion of the world that passes away; it is not
real, but imaginary, and it is only a corrupt imagination that makes it
a happiness; it is not substance, but a mere shadow; it is not what it
seems to be, nor will it prove what we promise ourselves from it; it is
as a dream, which may please us a little, while we are asleep, yet even
then it disturbs our repose; but, how pleasing soever it is, it is all
but a cheat, all false; when we awake we find it so. A hungry man dreams
that he eats, but he awakes and his soul is empty, [Isa
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#008.md). A man is never the more rich or
honourable for dreaming he is so. Who therefore will envy a man the
pleasure of a dream? (2.) What will be the issue of it; God will awake
to judgment, to plead his own and his people's injured cause; they shall
be made to awake out of the sleep of their carnal security, and then God
shall despise their image; he shall make it appear to all the world how
despicable it is; so that the righteous shall laugh at them, [Psa
52:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#006.md), [Psa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#007.md). How did God despise that rich
man's image when he said, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be
required of thee! [Luk 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#019.md), [Luk
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#020.md). We ought to be of God's mind,
for his judgment is according to truth, and not to admire and envy that
which he despises and will despise; for, sooner or later, he will bring
all the world to be of his mind.

[Psalms 73:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 73:21</span></span>

Behold Samson's riddle again unriddled, Out of the eater came forth
meat, and out of the strong sweetness; for we have here an account of
the good improvement which the psalmist made of that sore temptation
with which he had been assaulted and by which he was almost overcome. He
that stumbles and does not fall, by recovering himself takes so much the
longer steps forward. It was so with the psalmist here; many good
lessons he learned from his temptation, his struggles with it, and his
victories over it. Nor would God suffer his people to be tempted if his
grace were not sufficient for them, not only to save them from harm, but
to make them gainers by it; even this shall work for good.

I. He learned to think very humbly of himself and to abase and accuse
himself before God ([Psa 73:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#021.md), [Psa
73:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#022).md); he reflects with shame upon
the disorder and danger he was in, and the vexation he gave himself by
entertaining the temptation and parleying with it: My heart was grieved,
and I was pricked in my reins, as one afflicted with the acute pain of
the stone in the region of the kidneys. If evil thoughts at any time
enter into the mind of a good man, he does not roll them under his
tongue as a sweet morsel, but they are grievous and painful to him;
temptation was to Paul as a thorn in the flesh, [Co2
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007.md). This particular temptation, the
working of envy and discontent, is as painful as any; where it
constantly rests it is the rottenness of the bones ([Pro
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#030).md); where it does but occasionally
come it is the pricking of the reins. Fretfulness is a corruption that
is its own correction. Now in the reflection upon it, 1. He owns it was
his folly thus to vex himself: "So foolish was I to be my own
tormentor." Let peevish people thus reproach themselves for, and shame
themselves out of, their discontents. "What a fool am I thus to make
myself uneasy without a cause?" 2. He owns it was his ignorance to vex
himself at this: "So ignorant was I of that which I might have known,
and which, if I had known it aright, would have been sufficient to
silence my murmurs. I was as a beast (Behemoth - a great beast) before
thee. Beasts mind present things only, and never look before at what is
to come; and so did I. If I had not been a great fool, I should never
have suffered such a senseless temptation to prevail over me so far.
What! to envy wicked men upon account of their prosperity! To be ready
to wish myself one of them, and to think of changing conditions with
them! So foolish was I." Note, If good men do at any time, through the
surprise and strength of temptation, think, or speak, or act amiss, when
they see their error they will reflect upon it with sorrow, and shame,
and self-abhorrence, will call themselves fools for it. Surely I am more
brutish than any man, [Pro 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#002.md); [Job
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#005.md), [Job
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#006.md). Thus David, [Sa2
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#010.md).

II\. He took occasion hence to own his dependence on and obligations to
the grace of God ([Psa 73:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#023).md):
"Nevertheless, foolish as I am, I am continually with thee and in thy
favour; thou hast holden me by my right hand." This may refer either, 1.
To the care God had taken of him, and the kindness he had shown him, all
along from his beginning hitherto. He had said, in the hour of
temptation ([Psa 73:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#014).md), All the day
long have I been plagued; but here he corrects himself for that
passionate complaint: "Though God has chastened me, he has not cast me
off; notwithstanding all the crosses of my life, I have been continually
with thee; I have had thy presence with me, and thou hast been nigh unto
me in all that which I have called upon thee for; and therefore, though
perplexed, yet not in despair. Though God has sometimes written bitter
things against me, yet he has still holden me by my right hand, both to
keep me, that I should not desert him or fly off from him, and to
prevent my sinking and fainting under my burdens, or losing my way in
the wildernesses through which I have walked." If we have been kept in
the way with God, kept closely in our duty and upheld in our integrity,
we must own ourselves indebted to the free grace of God for our
preservation: Having obtained help of God, I continue hitherto. And, if
he has thus maintained the spiritual life, the earnest of eternal life,
we ought not to complain, whatever calamities of this present time we
have met with. Or, 2. To the late experience he had had of the power of
divine grace in carrying him through this strong temptation and bringing
him off a conqueror: "I was foolish and ignorant, and yet thou hast had
compassion on me and taught me ([Heb
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#002).md), and kept me under thy
protection;" for the unworthiness of man is no bar to the free grace of
God. We must ascribe our safety in temptation, and our victory over it,
not to our own wisdom, for we are foolish and ignorant, but to the
gracious presence of God with us and the prevalency of Christ's
intercession for us, that our faith may not fail: "My feet were almost
gone, and they would have quite gone, past recovery, but that thou hast
holden me by my right hand and so kept me from falling."

III\. He encouraged himself to hope that the same God who had delivered
him from this evil work would preserve him to his heavenly kingdom, as
St. Paul does ([Ti2 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#018).md): "I am now
upheld by thee, therefore thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, leading
me, as thou hast done hitherto, many a difficult step; and, since I am
now continually with thee, thou shalt afterwards receive me to glory"
[Psa 73:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#024.md). This completes the
happiness of the saints, so that they have no reason to envy the worldly
prosperity of sinners. Note, 1. All those who commit themselves to God
shall be guided with his counsel, with the counsel both of his word and
of his Spirit, the best counsellors. The psalmist had like to have paid
dearly for following his own counsels in this temptation and therefore
resolves for the future to take God's advice, which shall never be
wanting to those that duly seek it with a resolution to follow it. 2.
All those who are guided and led by the counsel of God in this world
shall be received to his glory in another world. If we make God's glory
in us the end we aim at, he will make our glory with him the end we
shall for ever be happy in. Upon this consideration, let us never envy
sinners, but rather bless ourselves in our own blessedness. If God
direct us in the way of our duty, and prevent our turning aside out of
it, he will afterwards, when our state of trial and preparation is over,
receive us to his kingdom and glory, the believing hopes and prospects
of which will reconcile us to all the dark providences that now puzzle
and perplex us, and ease us of the pain we have been put into by some
threatening temptations.

IV\. He was hereby quickened to cleave the more closely to God, and very
much confirmed and comforted in the choice he had made of him, [Psa
73:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#025.md), [Psa
73:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#026.md). His thoughts here dwell with
delight upon his own happiness in God, as much greater then the
happiness of the ungodly that prospered in the world. He saw little
reason to envy them what they had in the creature when he found how much
more and better, surer and sweeter, comforts he had in the Creator, and
what cause he had to congratulate himself on this account. He had
complained of his afflictions ([Psa
73:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#014).md); but this makes them very light
and easy, All is well if God be mine. We have here the breathings of a
sanctified soul towards God, and its repose in him, as that to a godly
man really which the prosperity of a worldly man is to him in conceit
and imagination: Whom have I in heaven but thee? There is scarcely a
verse in all the psalms more expressive than this of the pious and
devout affections of a soul to God; here it soars up towards him,
follows hard after him, and yet, at the same time, has an entire
satisfaction and complacency in him.

1\. It is here supposed that God alone is the felicity and chief good of
man. He, and he only, that made the soul, can make it happy; there is
none in heaven, none in earth, that can pretend to do it besides.

2\. Here are expressed the workings and breathings of a soul towards God
accordingly. If God be our felicity,

(1.) Then we must have him (Whom have I but thee?), we must choose him,
and make sure to ourselves an interest in him. What will it avail us
that he is the felicity of souls if he be not the felicity of our souls,
and if we do not by a lively faith make him ours, by joining ourselves
to him in an everlasting covenant?

(2.) Then our desire must be towards him and our delight in him (the
word signifies both); we must delight in what we have of God and desire
what we yet further hope for. Our desires must not only be offered up to
God, but they must all terminate in him, desiring nothing more than God,
but still more and more of him. This includes all our prayers, Lord,
give us thyself; as that includes all the promises, I will be to them a
God. The desire of our souls is to thy name.

(3.) We must prefer him in our choice and desire before any other.
\[1.\] "There is none in heaven but thee, none to seek to or trust in,
none to court or covet acquaintance with, but thee." God is in himself
more glorious than any celestial being ([Psa
89:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#006).md), and must be, in our eyes,
infinitely more desirable. Excellent beings there are in heaven, but God
alone can make us happy. His favour is infinitely more to us than the
refreshment of the dews of heaven or the benign influence of the stars
of heaven, more than the friendship of the saints in heaven or the good
offices of the angels there. \[2.\] I desire none on earth besides thee;
not only none in heaven, a place at a distance, which we have but little
acquaintance with, but none on earth neither, where we have many friends
and where much of our present interest and concern lie. "Earth carries
away the desires of most men, and yet I have none on earth, no persons,
no things, no possessions, no delights, that I desire besides thee or
with thee, in comparison or competition with thee." We must desire
nothing besides God but what we desire for him (nil praeter te nisi
propter te - nothing besides thee except for thy sake), nothing but what
we desire from him, and can be content without so that it be made up in
him. We must desire nothing besides God as needful to be a partner with
him in making us happy.

(4.) Then we must repose ourselves in God with an entire satisfaction,
[Psa 73:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#026.md). Observe here, \[1.\] Great
distress and trouble supposed: My flesh and my heart fail. Note, Others
have experienced and we must expect, the failing both of flesh and
heart. The body will fail by sickness, age, and death; and that which
touches the bone and the flesh touches us in a tender part, that part of
ourselves which we have been but too fond of; when the flesh fails the
heart is ready to fail too; the conduct, courage, and comfort fail.
\[2.\] Sovereign relief provided in this distress: But God is the
strength of my heart and my portion for ever. Note, Gracious souls, in
their greatest distresses, rest upon God as their spiritual strength and
their eternal portion. First, "He is the strength of my heart, the rock
of my heart, a firm foundation, which will bear my weight and not sink
under it. God is the strength of my heart; I have found him so; I do so
still, and hope ever to find him so." In the distress supposed, he had
put the case of a double failure, both flesh and heart fail; but, in the
relief, he fastens on a single support: he leaves out the flesh and the
consideration of that, it is enough that God is the strength of his
heart. He speaks as one careless of the body (let that fail, there is no
remedy), but as one concerned about the soul, to be strengthened in the
inner man. Secondly, "He is my portion for ever; he will not only
support me while I am here, but make me happy when I go hence." The
saints choose God for their portion, they have him for their portion,
and it is their happiness that he will be their portion, a portion that
will last as long as the immortal soul lasts.

V. He was fully convinced of the miserable condition of all wicked
people. This he learned in the sanctuary upon this occasion, and he
would never forget it ([Psa 73:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#027).md):
"Lo, those that are far from thee, in a state of distance and
estrangement, that desire the Almighty to depart from them, shall
certainly perish; so shall their doom be; they choose to be far from
God, and they shall be far from him for ever. Thou wilt justly destroy
all those that go a whoring from thee, that is, all apostates, that in
profession have been betrothed to God, but forsake him, their duty to
him and their communion with him, to embrace the bosom of a stranger."
The doom is sever, no less than perishing and being destroyed. It is
universal: "They shall all be destroyed without exception." It is
certain: "Thou hast destroyed; it is as sure to be done as if done
already; and the destruction of some ungodly men is an earnest of the
perdition of all." God himself undertakes to do it, into whose hands it
is a fearful thing to fall: "Thou, though infinite in goodness, wilt
reckon for thy injured honour and abused patience, and wilt destroy
those that go a whoring from thee."

VI\. He was greatly encouraged to cleave to God and to confide in him,
[Psa 73:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#028.md). If those that are far from
God shall perish, then, 1. Let this constrain us to live in communion
with God; "if it fare so ill with those that live at a distance from
him, then it is good, very good, the chief good, that good for a man, in
this life, which he should most carefully pursue and secure, it is best
for me to draw near to God, and to have God draw near to me;" the
original may take in both. But for my part (so I would read it) the
approach of God is good for me. Our drawing near to God takes rise from
his drawing near to us, and it is the happy meeting that makes the
bliss. Here is a great truth laid down, That it is good to draw near to
God; but the life of it lies in the application, "It is good for me."
Those are the wise who know what is good for themselves: "It is good,
says he (and every good man agrees with him in it), it is good for me to
draw near to God; it is my duty; it is my interest." 2. Let us therefore
live in a continual dependence upon him: "I have put my trust in the
Lord God, and will never go a whoring from him after any creature
confidences." If wicked men, notwithstanding all their prosperity, shall
perish and be destroyed, then let us trust in the Lord God, in him, not
in them (see [Psa 146:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#003).md), in him,
and not in our worldly prosperity; let us trust in God, and neither fret
at them nor be afraid of them; let us trust in him for a better portion
than theirs is. 3. While we do so, let us not doubt but that we shall
have occasion to praise his name. Let us trust in the Lord, that we may
declare all his works. Note, Those that with an upright heart put their
trust in God shall never want matter for thanksgiving to him.
