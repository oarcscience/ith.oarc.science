### [Isaiah Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 28:0</span></span>

In this chapter, I. The Ephraimites are reproved and threatened for
their pride and drunkenness, their security and sensuality ([Isa
28:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001).md). But, in the midst of this,
here is a gracious promise of God's favour to the remnant of his people
([Isa 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#005.md), [Isa
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#006).md). II. They are likewise reproved
and threatened for their dulness and stupidity, and unaptness to profit
by the instructions which the prophets gave them in God's name ([Isa
28:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#009).md). III. The rulers of Jerusalem
are reproved and threatened for their insolent contempt of God's
judgments, and setting them at defiance; and, after a gracious promise
of Christ and his grace, they are made to know that the vain hopes of
escaping the judgments of God with which they flattered themselves would
certainly deceive them ([Isa
28:14-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#014).md). IV. All this is confirmed
by a comparison borrowed from the method which the husbandman takes with
his ground and grain, according to which they must expect God would
proceed with his people, whom he had lately called his threshing and the
corn of his floor ([Isa 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#010).md) ([Isa
28:23-29](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#023).md). This is written for our
admonition, and is profitable for reproof and warning to us.

[Isaiah 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 28:1</span></span>

Here, I. The prophet warns the kingdom of the ten tribes of the
judgments that were coming upon them for their sins, which were soon
after executed by the king of Assyria, who laid their country waste, and
carried the people into captivity. Ephraim had his name from
fruitfulness, their soil being very fertile and the products of it
abundant and the best of the kind; they had a great many fat valleys
([Isa 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001.md), [Isa
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#004).md), and Samaria, which was situated
on a hill, was, as it were, on the head of the fat valleys. Their
country was rich and pleasant, and as the garden of the Lord: it was the
glory of Canaan, as that was the glory of all lands; their harvest and
vintage were the glorious beauty on the head of their valleys, which
were covered over with corn and vines. Now observe,

1\. What an ill use they made of their plenty. What God gave them to
serve him with they perverted, and abused, by making it the food and
fuel of their lusts. (1.) They were puffed up with pride by it. The
goodness with which God crowned their years, which should have been to
him a crown of praise, was to them a crown of pride. Those that are rich
in the world are apt to be high-minded, [Ti1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017.md). Their king, who wore the crown,
was proud that he ruled over so rich a country; Samaria, their royal
city, was notorious for pride. Perhaps it was usual at their festivals,
or revels, to wear garlands made up of flowers and ears of corn, which
they wore in honour of their fruitful country. Pride was a sin that
generally prevailed among them, and therefore the prophet, in his name
who resists the proud, boldly proclaims a woe to the crown of pride. If
those who wear crowns be proud of them, let them not think to escape
this woe. What men are proud of, be it ever so mean, is to them as a
crown; he that is proud thinks himself as great as a king. But woe to
those who thus exalt themselves, for they shall be abased; their pride
is the preface to their destruction. (2.) They indulged themselves in
sensuality. Ephraim was notorious for drunkenness, and excess of riot;
Samaria, the head of the fat valleys, was full of those that were
overcome with wine, were broken with it, so the margin. See how
foolishly drunkards act, and no marvel when, in the very commission of
the sin, they make fools and brutes of themselves; they yield, \[1.\] To
be conquered by the sin; it overcomes them, and brings them into bondage
([Pe2 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#019).md); they are led captive by
it, and the captivity is the more shameful and inglorious because it is
voluntary. Some of these wretched slaves have themselves owned that
there is not a greater drudgery in the world than hard drinking. They
are overcome not with the wine, but with the love of it. \[2.\] To be
ruined by it. They are broken by wine. Their constitution is broken by
it, and their health ruined. They are broken in the callings and
estates, and their souls are in danger of being eternally undone, and
all this for the gratification of a base lust. Woe to these drunkards of
Ephraim! Ministers must bring the general woes of the word home to
particular places and persons. We must say, Woe to this or that person,
if he be a drunkard. There is a particular woe to the drunkards of
Ephraim, for they are of God's professing people, and it becomes them
worse than any other; they know better, and therefore should give a
better example. Some make the crown of pride to belong to the drunkards,
and to mean the garlands with which those were crowned that got the
victory in their wicked drinking matches and drank down the rest of the
company. They were proud of their being mighty to drink wine; but woe to
those who thus glory in their shame.

2\. The justice of God in taking away their plenty from them, which they
thus abused. Their glorious beauty, the plenty they were proud of, is
but a fading flower; it is meat that perishes. The most substantial
fruits, if God blast them and blow upon them, are but fading flowers,
[Isa 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001.md). God can easily take away
their corn in the season thereof ([Hos
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#009).md), and recover locum vastatum -
ground that has been alienated and has run to waste, those goods of his
which they prepared for Baal. God has an officer ready to make a seizure
for him, has one at his beck, a mighty and strong one, who is able to do
the business, even the king of Assyria, who shall cast down to the earth
with the hand, shall easily and effectually, and with the turn of a
hand, destroy all that which they are proud of and pleased with, [Isa
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#002.md). He shall throw it down to the
ground, to be broken to pieces with a strong hand, with a hand that they
cannot oppose. Then the crown of pride, and the drunkards of Ephraim,
shall be trodden under foot ([Isa
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#003).md); they shall lie exposed to
contempt, and shall not be able to recover themselves. Drunkards, in
their folly, are apt to talk proudly, and vaunt themselves most when
they most shame themselves; but they thereby render themselves the more
ridiculous. The beauty of their valleys, which they gloried in, will be,
(1.) Like a fading flower (as before, [Isa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001).md); it will wither of itself, and
has in itself the principles of its own corruption; it will perish in
time by its own moth and rust. (2.) Like the hasty fruit, which, as soon
as it is discovered, is plucked and eaten up; so the wealth of this
world, besides that it is apt to decay of itself, is subject to be
devoured by others as greedily as the first-ripe fruit, which is
earnestly desired, [Mic 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#001.md). Thieves
break through and steal. The harvest which the worldling is proud of the
hungry eat up ([Job 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#005).md); no sooner do
they see the prey but they catch at it, and swallow up all they can lay
their hands on. It is likewise easily devoured, as that fruit which,
being ripe before it has grown, is very small, and is soon eaten up; and
there being little of it, and that of little worth, it is not reserved,
but used immediately.

II\. He next turns to the kingdom of Judah, whom he calls the residue of
his people ([Isa 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#005).md), for they were
but two tribes to the other ten.

1\. He promises them God's favours, and that they shall be taken under
his guidance and protection when the beauty of Ephraim shall be left
exposed to be trodden down and eaten up, [Isa
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#005.md), [Isa
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#006.md). In that day, when the Assyrian
army is laying Israel waste, and Judah might think that their
neighbour's house being on fire their own was in danger, in that day of
treading down and perplexity, then God will be to the residue of his
people all they need and can desire; not only to the kingdom of Judah,
but to those of Israel who had kept their integrity, and, as was
probably the case with some, betook themselves to the land of Judah, to
be sheltered by good king Hezekiah. When the Assyrian, that mighty one,
was in Israel as a tempest of hail, noisy and battering, as a destroying
storm bearing down all before it, especially at sea, and as a flood of
mighty waters overflowing the country ([Isa
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#002).md), then in that day will the Lord
of hosts, of all hosts, distinguish by peculiar favours his people who
have distinguished themselves by a steady and singular adherence to him,
and that which they most need he will himself be to them. This very much
enhances the worth of the promises that God, covenanting to be to his
people a God all-sufficient, undertakes to be himself all that to them
which they can desire. (1.) He will put all the credit and honour upon
them which are requisite, not only to rescue them from contempt, but to
gain them esteem and reputation. He will be to them for a crown of glory
and for a diadem of beauty. Those that wore the crown of pride looked
upon God's people with disdain, and trampled upon them, for they were
the song of the drunkards of Ephraim; but God will so appear for them by
his providence as to make it evident that they have his favour towards
them, and that shall be to them a crown of glory; for what greater glory
can any people have than for God to acknowledge them as his own? And he
will so appear in them, by his grace, as to make it evident that they
have his image renewed on them, and that shall be to them a diadem of
beauty; for what greater beauty can any person have than the beauty of
holiness? Note, Those that have God for their God have him for a crown
of glory and a diadem of beauty; for they are made to him kings and
priests. (2.) He will give them all the wisdom and grace necessary to
the due discharge of the duty of their place. He will himself be a
spirit of judgment to those that sit in judgment; the privy counsellors
shall be guided by wisdom and discretion and the judges shall govern by
justice and equity. It is a great mercy to any people when those that
are called to places of power and public trust are qualified for their
places, when those that sit in judgment have a spirit of judgment, a
spirit of government. (3.) He will give them all the courage and
boldness requisite to carry them resolutely through the difficulties and
oppositions they are likely to meet with. He will be for strength to
those that turn the battle to the gate, to the gates of the enemy whose
cities they besiege, or to their own gates, when they sally out upon the
enemies that besiege them. The strength of the soldiery depends as much
upon God as the wisdom of the magistracy; and where God gives both these
he is to that people a crown of glory. This may well be supposed to
refer to Christ, and so the Chaldee paraphrast understands it: In that
day shall the Messiah be a crown of glory. Simeon calls him the glory of
his people Israel; and he is made of God to us wisdom, righteousness,
and strength.

2\. He complains of the corruptions that were found among them, and the
many corrupt ones ([Isa 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#007).md): But
they also, many of those of Judah, have erred through wine. There are
drunkards of Jerusalem, as well as drunkards of Ephraim; and therefore
the mercy of God is to be so much the more admired that he has not
blasted the glory of Judah as he has done that of Ephraim. Sparing mercy
lays us under peculiar obligations when it is thus distinguishing.
Ephraim's sins are found in Judah, and yet not Ephraim's ruins. They
have erred through wine. Their drinking to excess is itself a practical
error; they think to raise their fancy by it, but they ruin their
judgment, and so put a cheat upon themselves; they think to preserve
their health by it and help digestion, but they spoil their constitution
and hasten diseases and deaths. It is also the occasion of a great many
errors in principle; their understanding is clouded and their conscience
debauched by it; and therefore, to support themselves in it, they
espouse corrupt notions, and form their minds in favour of their lusts.
Probably some were drawn in to worship idols by their love of the wine
and strong drink which there was plenty of at their idolatrous
festivals; and so they erred through wine, as Israel, for love of the
daughters of Moab, joined themselves to Baal-peor. Three things are here
observed as aggravations of this sin: - (1.) That those were guilty of
it whose business it was to warn others against it and to teach them
better, and therefore who ought to have set a better example: The priest
and the prophet are swallowed up of wine; their office is quite drowned
and lost in it. The priests, as sacrificers, were obliged by a
particular law to be temperate ([Lev
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#009).md), and, as rulers and magistrates,
it was not for them to drink wine, [Pro
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#004.md). The prophets were a kind of
Nazarites (as appears by [Amo 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#011).md),
and, as reprovers by office, were concerned to keep at the utmost
distance from the sins they reproved in others; yet there were many of
them ensnared in this sin. What! a priest, a prophet, a minister, and
yet drunk! Tell it not in Gath. Such a scandal are they to their coat.
(2.) That the consequences of it were very pernicious, not only by the
ill influence of their example, but the prophet, when he was drunk,
erred in vision; the false prophets plainly discovered themselves to be
so when they were in drink. The priest stumbled in judgment and forgot
the law ([Pro 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#005).md); he reeled and
staggered as much in the operations of his mind as in the motions of his
body. What wisdom or justice can be expected from those that sacrifice
reason, and virtue, and conscience, and all that is valuable to such a
base lust as the love of strong drink is? Happy art thou, O land! when
thy princes eat and drink for strength, and not for drunkenness, [Ecc
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#017). (3..md) That the disease was
epidemic, and the generality of those that kept any thing of a table
were infected with it: All tables are full of vomit, [Isa
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#008.md). See what an odious thing the sin
of drunkenness is, what an affront it is to human society; it is rude
and ill-mannered enough to sicken the beholders, for the tables where
they eat their meat are filthily stained with the marks of this sin,
which the sinners declare as Sodom. Their tables are full of vomit, so
that the victor, instead of being proud of his crown, ought rather to be
ashamed of it. It bodes ill to any people when so sottish a sin as
drunkenness has become national.

[Isaiah 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 28:9</span></span>

The prophet here complains of the wretched stupidity of this people,
that they were unteachable and made no improvement of the means of grace
which they possessed; they still continued as they were, their mistakes
not rectified, their hearts not renewed, nor their lives reformed.
Observe,

I. What it was that their prophets and ministers designed and aimed at.
It was to teach them knowledge, the knowledge of God and his will, and
to make them understand doctrine, [Isa
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#009.md). This is God's way of dealing
with men, to enlighten men's minds first with the knowledge of his
truth, and thus to gain their affections, and bring their wills into a
compliance with his laws; thus he enters in by the door, whereas the
thief and the robber climb up another way.

II\. What method they took, in pursuance of this design. They left no
means untried to do them good, but taught them as children are taught,
little children that are beginning to learn, that are taken from the
breast to the book ([Isa 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#009).md), for
among the Jews it was common for mothers to nurse their children till
they were three years old, and almost ready to go to school. And it is
good to begin betimes with children, to teach them, as they are capable,
the good knowledge of the Lord, and to instruct them even when they are
but newly weaned from the milk. The prophets taught them as children are
taught; for, 1. They were constant and industrious in teaching them.
They took great pains with them, and with great prudence, teaching them
as they needed it and were able to bear it ([Isa
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#010).md): Precept upon precept. It must
be so, or (as some read) it has been so. They have been taught, as
children are taught to read, by precept upon precept, and taught to
write by line upon line, a little here and a little there, a little of
one thing and a little of another, that the variety of instructions
might be pleasing and inviting, - a little at one time and a little at
another, that they might not have their memories overcharged, - a little
from one prophet and a little from another, that every one might be
pleased with his friend and him whom he admired. Note, For our
instruction in the things of God it is requisite that we have precept
upon precept and line upon line, that one precept and line should be
followed, and so enforced by another; the precept of justice must be
upon the precept of piety, and the precept of charity upon that of
justice. Nay, it is necessary that the same precept and the same line
should be often repeated and inculcated upon us, that we may the better
understand them and the more easily recollect them when we have occasion
for them. Teachers should accommodate themselves to the capacity of the
learners, give them what they most need and can best bear, and a little
at a time, [Deu 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#006.md), [Deu
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#007.md). 2. They courted and persuaded
them to learn, [Isa 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#012.md). God, by his
prophets, said to them, "This way that we are directing you to, and
directing you in, is the rest, the only rest, wherewith you may cause
the weary to rest; and this will be the refreshing of your own souls,
and will bring rest to your country from the wars and other calamities
with which it has been long harassed." Note, God by his word calls us to
nothing but what is really for our advantage; for the service of God is
the only true rest for those that are weary of the service of sin and
there is no refreshing but under the easy yoke of the Lord Jesus.

III\. What little effect all this had upon the people. They were as
unapt to learn as young children newly weaned from the milk, and it was
as impossible to fasten any thing upon them ([Isa
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#009).md): nay, one would choose rather to
teach a child of two years old than undertake to teach them; for they
have not only (like such a child) no capacity to receive what is taught
them, but they are prejudiced against it. As children, they have need of
milk, and cannot bear strong meat, [Heb
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012.md). 1. They would not hear ([Isa
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#012).md), no, not that which would be
rest and refreshing to them. They had no mind to hear it. The word of
God commanded their serious attention, but could not gain it; they were
where it was preached, but they turned a deaf ear to it, or as it came
in at one ear it went out at the other. 2. They would not heed. It was
unto them precept upon precept, and line upon line ([Isa
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#013).md); they went on in a road of
external performances; they kept up the old custom of attending upon the
prophet's preaching and it was continually sounding in their ears, but
that was all; it made no impression upon them; they had the letter of
the precept, but no experience of the power and spirit of it; it was
continually beating upon them, but it beat nothing into them. Nay, 3. It
should seem, they ridiculed the prophet's preaching, and bantered it.
The word of the Lord was unto them Tsau latsau, kau lakau; in the
original it is in rhyme; they made a song of the prophet's words, and
sang it when they were merry over their wine. David was the song of the
drunkards. It is great impiety, and a high affront to God, thus to make
a jest of sacred things, to speak of that vainly which should make us
serious.

IV\. How severely God would reckon with them for this. 1. He would
deprive them of the privilege of plain preaching, and speak to them with
stammering lips and another tongue, [Isa
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#011.md). Those that will not understand
what is plain and level to their capacity, but despise it as mean and
trifling, are justly amused with that which is above them. Or God will
send foreign armies among them, whose language they understand not, to
lay their country waste. Those that will not hear the comfortable voice
of God's word shall be made to hear the dreadful voice of his rod. Or
these words may be taken as denoting God's gracious condescension to
their capacity in his dealing with them; he lisped to them in their own
language, as nurses do to their children, with stammering lips, to humor
them; he changed his voice, tried first one way and then another; the
apostle quotes it as a favour ([Co1
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#021).md), applying it to the gift of
tongues, and complaining that yet for all this they would not hear. 2.
He would bring utter ruin upon them. By their profane contempt of God
and his word they are but hastening on their own ruin, and ripening
themselves for it; it is that they may go and fall backward, may grow
worse and worse, may depart further and further from God, and proceed
from one sin to another, till they be quite broken, and snared, and
taken, and ruined, [Isa 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#013.md). They
have here a little and there a little of the word of God; they think it
too much, and say to the seers, See not; but it proves too little to
convert them, and will prove enough to condemn them. If it be not a
savour of life unto life, it will be a savour of death unto death.

[Isaiah 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 28:14</span></span>

The prophet, having reproved those that made a jest of the word of God,
here goes on to reprove those that made a jest of the judgments of God,
and set them at defiance; for he is a jealous God, and will not suffer
either his ordinances or his providences to be brought into contempt. He
addressed himself to the scornful men who ruled in Jerusalem, who were
the magistrates of the city, [Isa
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#014.md). It is bad with a people when
their thrones of judgment become the seats of the scornful, when rulers
are scorners; but that the rulers of Jerusalem should be men of such a
character, that they should make light of God's judgments and scorn to
take notice of the tokens of his displeasure, is very sad. Who will be
mourners in Zion if they are scorners? Observe,

I. How these scornful men lulled themselves asleep in carnal security,
and even challenged God Almighty to do his worst ([Isa
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#015).md) You have said, We have made a
covenant with death and the grave. They thought themselves as sure of
their lives, even when the most destroying judgments were abroad, as if
they had made a bargain with death, upon a valuable consideration, not
to come till they sent for him or not to take them away by any violence,
but by old age. If we be at peace with God, and have made a covenant
with him, we have in effect made a covenant with death that it shall
come in the fittest time, that whenever it comes, it shall be no terror
to us, nor do us any real damage; death is ours if we be Christ's ([Co1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#022.md), [Co1
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#023).md): but to think of making death
our friend, or being in league with it, while by sin we are making God
our enemy and are at war with him, is the greatest absurdity that can
be. It was fond conceit which these scorners had, "When the overflowing
scourge shall pass through our country, and others shall fall under it,
yet it shall not come to us, not reach us, though it extend far, not
bear us down, though it is an overflowing scourge." It is the greatest
folly imaginable for impenitent sinners to think that either in this
world or the other they shall fare better than their neighbours. But
what is the ground of their confidence? Why, truly, We have made lies
our refuge. Either, 1. Those things which the prophets told them would
be lies and falsehood to them and would deceive, but which they
themselves looked upon as substantial fences. The protection of their
idols, the promises with which their false prophets soothed them, their
policy, their wealth, their interest in the people; these they confided
in, and not in God; nay, these they confided in against God. Or, 2.
Those things which should be lies and falsehood to the enemy, who was
flagellum Dei - the scourge of God, the overflowing scourge; they would
secure themselves by imposing upon the enemy with their stratagems of
war, or their feigned submissions in treaties of peace. The rest of the
cities of Judah were taken because they made an obstinate defence; but
the rulers of Jerusalem hope to succeed better. They think themselves
greater politicians than those of the country towns; they will
compliment the king of Assyria with a promise to surrender their city,
or to become tributaries to him, with a purpose at the same time to
shake off his yoke as soon as the danger is over, not caring though they
be found liars to him, as the expression is, [Deu
33:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029.md). Note, Those put a cheat upon
themselves that think to gain their point by putting cheats upon those
they deal with. Those that pursue their designs by trick and fraud, by
mean and paltry shifts, may perhaps compasss them, but cannot expect
comfort in them. Honesty is the best policy. But such refuges as these
are those driven to that depart from God, and throw themselves out of
his protection.

II\. How God, by the prophet, awakens them out of this sleep, and shows
them the folly of their security.

1\. He tells them upon what grounds they might be secure. He does not
disturb their false confidences, till he has first shown them a firm
bottom on which they may repose themselves ([Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016).md): Behold, I lay in Zion for a
foundation a stone. This foundation is, (1.) The promises of God in
general - his word, upon which he has caused his people to hope - his
covenant with Abraham, that he would be a God to him and his; this is a
foundation, a foundation of stone, firm and lasting, for faith to build
upon; it is a tried stone, for all the saints have stayed themselves
upon it and it never failed them. (2.) The promise of Christ in
particular; for to him this is expressly applied in the New Testament,
[Pe1 2:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006.md). He is that stone which has
become the head of the corner. The great promise of the Messiah and his
kingdom, which was to begin at Jerusalem, was sufficient to make God's
people easy in the worst of times; for they knew well that till he came
the sceptre should not depart from Judah. Zion shall continue while this
foundation is yet to be laid there. "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, for
the comfort of those that dare not make lies their refuge, Behold, and
look upon me as one that has undertaken to lay in Zion a Stone," Jesus
Christ is a foundation of God's laying. This is the Lord's doing. He is
laid in Zion, in the church, in the holy hill. He is a tried stone, a
trying stone (so some), a touch-stone, that shall distinguish between
true and counterfeit. He is a precious stone, for such are the
foundations of the New Jerusalem ([Rev
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#019).md), a corner-stone, in whom the
sides of the building are united, the head-stone of the corner. And he
that believes these promises, and rests upon them, shall not make haste,
shall not run to and fro in a hurry, as men at their wits' end, shall
not be shifting hither and thither for his own safety, nor be driven to
his feet by any terrors, as the wicked man is said to be ([Job
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#011).md), but with a fixed heart shall
quietly wait the event, saying, Welcome the will of God. He shall not
make haste in his expectations, so as to anticipate the time set in the
divine counsels, but, though it tarry, will wait the appointed hour,
knowing that he that shall come will come, and will not tarry. He that
believes will not make more haste than good speed, but be satisfied that
God's time is the best time, and wait with patience for it. The apostle
from the Septuagint explains this, [Pe1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006.md). He that believes on him shall not
be confounded; his expectations shall not be frustrated, but far
out-done.

2\. He tells them that upon the grounds which they now built on they
could not be safe, but their confidences would certainly fail them ([Isa
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#017).md): Judgment will I lay to the
line, and righteousness to the plummet. This denotes,

(1.) The building up of his church; having laid the foundation ([Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016).md), he will raise the structure,
as builders do, by line and plummet, [Zac
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010.md). Righteousness shall be the line
and judgment the plummet. The church, being grounded on Christ, shall be
formed and reformed by the scripture, the standing rule of judgment and
righteousness. Judgment shall return unto righteousness, [Psa
94:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#015.md). Or,

(2.) The punishing of the church's enemies, against whom he will proceed
in strict justice, according to the threatenings of the law. He will
give them their deserts, and bring upon them the judgments they have
challenged, but in wisdom too, and by an exact rule, that the tares may
not be plucked up with the wheat. And when God comes thus to execute
judgment,

\[1.\] These scornful men will be made ashamed of the vain hopes with
which they had deluded themselves. First, They designed to make lies
their refuge; but it will indeed prove a refuge of lies, which the hail
shall sweep away, that tempest of hail spoken of [Isa
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#002.md). Those that make lies their
refuge build upon the sand, and the building will fall when the storm
comes, and bury the builder in the ruins of it. Those that make any
thing their hiding place but Christ shall find that the waters will
overflow it, as every shelter but the ark was over-topped and overthrown
by the waters of the deluge. Such is the hope of the hypocrite; this
will come of all his confidences. Secondly, They boasted of a covenant
with death, and an agreement with the grave; but it shall be
disannulled, as made without his consent who has the keys and sovereign
command of hell and death. Those do but delude themselves that think by
any wiles to evade the judgments of God. Thirdly, They fancied that when
the overflowing scourge should pass through the land it should not come
near them; but the prophet tells them that then, when others were
falling by the common calamity, they should not only share in it, but
should be trodden down by it: "You shall be to it for a treading down;
it shall triumph over you as much as over any other, and you shall
become its easy prey." They are further told ([Isa
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#019).md), 1. That it shall begin with
them; they shall be so far from escaping it that they shall be the first
that shall fall by it: "From the time it goes forth it shall take you,
as if it came on purpose to seize you." 2. That it shall pursue them
closely: "Morning by morning shall it pass over; as duly as the day
returns you shall hear of some desolation or other made by it; for
divine justice will follow its blow; you shall never be safe nor easy by
day nor by night; there shall be a pestilence walking in darkness and a
destruction wasting at noonday." 3. That there shall be no avoiding it:
"The understanding of the report of its approach shall not give you any
opportunity to make your escape, for there shall be no way of escape
open; but it shall be only a vexation, you shall see it coming, and not
see how to help yourselves." Or, "The very report of it at a distance
will be a terror to you; what then will the thing itself be?" Evil
tidings are a terror and vexation to scorners, but he whose heart is
fixed, trusting in God, is not afraid of them; whereas, when the
overflowing scourge comes, then all the comforts and confidences of
scorners fail them, [Isa 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#020). (1..md)
That in which they thought to repose themselves reaches not to the
length of their expectations: The bed is shorter than that a man can
stretch himself upon it, so that he is forced to cramp and contract
himself. (2.) That in which they thought to shelter themselves proves
insufficient to answer the intention: The covering is narrower than that
a man can wrap himself in it. Those that do not build upon Christ as
their foundation, but rest in a righteousness of their own, will prove
in the end thus to have deceived themselves; they can never be easy,
safe, nor warm; the bed is too short, the covering is too narrow; like
our first parents' fig-leaves, the shame of their nakedness will still
appear.

\[2.\] God will be glorified in the accomplishment of his counsels, [Isa
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#021.md). When God comes to contend with
these scorners, First, He will do his work, and bring to pass his act,
he will work for his own honour and glory, according to his own purpose;
the work shall appear to all that see it to be the work of God as the
righteous Judge of the earth. Secondly, He will do it now against his
people, as formerly he did it against their enemies, by which his
justice will appear to be impartial; he will now rise up against
Jerusalem as, in David's time, against the Philistines in Mount Perazim
([Sa2 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#020).md), and as, in Joshua's time,
against the Canaanites in the valley of Gibeon. If those that profess
themselves members of God's church by their pride and scornfulness make
themselves like Philistines and Canaanites, they must expect to be dealt
with as such. Thirdly, This will be his strange work, his strange act,
his foreign deed. It is work that he is backward to: he rather delights
in showing mercy, and does not afflict willingly. It is work that he is
not used to as to his own people; he protects and favours them. It is a
strange work indeed if he turn to be their enemy and fight against them,
ch. 63:10. It is a work that all the neighbours will stand amazed at
([Deu 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#024).md), and therefore the ruins
of Jerusalem are said to be an astonishment, [Jer
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#018.md).

Lastly, We have the use and application of all this ([Isa
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#022).md): "Therefore be you not mockers;
dare not to ridicule either the reproofs of God's word or the approaches
of his judgments." Mocking the messengers of the Lord was Jerusalem's
measure-filling sin. The consideration of the judgments of God that are
coming upon hypocritical professors should effectually silence mockers,
and make them serious: "Be you not mockers, lest your bands be made
strong, both the bands by which you are bound under the dominion of sin"
(for there is little hope of the conversion of mockers) "and the bands
by which you are bound over to the judgments of God." God has bands of
justice strong enough to hold those that break all the bonds of his law
asunder and cast away all his cord from them. Let not these mockers make
light of divine threatenings, for the prophet (who is one of those with
whom the secret of the Lord is) assures them that the Lord God of hosts
has, in his hearing, determined a consumption upon the whole earth; and
can they think to escape? or shall their unbelief invalidate the
threatening?

[Isaiah 28:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 28:23</span></span>

This parable, which (like many of our Saviour's parables) is borrowed
from the husbandman's calling, is ushered in with a solemn preface
demanding attention, He that has ears to hear, let him hear, hear and
understand, [Isa 28:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#023.md).

I. The parable here is plain enough, that the husbandman applies himself
to the business of his calling with a great deal of pains and prudence,
secundum artem - according to rule, and, as his judgment directs him,
observes a method and order in his work. 1. In his ploughing and sowing:
Does the ploughman plough all day to sow? Yes, he does, and he ploughs
in hope and sows in hope, [Co1 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#010.md).
Does he open and break the clods? Yes, he does, that the land may be fit
to receive the seed. And when he has thus made plain the face thereof
does he not sow his seed, seed suitable to the soil? For the husbandman
knows what grain is fit for clayey ground and what for sandy ground,
and, accordingly, he sows each in its place - wheat in the principal
place (so the margin reads it), for it is the principal grain, and was a
staple commodity of Canaan ([Eze
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#017).md), and barley in the appointed
place. The wisdom and goodness of the God of nature are to be observed
in this, that, to oblige his creatures with a grateful variety of
productions, he has suited to them an agreeable variety of earths. 2. In
his threshing, [Isa 28:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#027.md), [Isa
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#028.md). This also he proportions to the
grain that is to be threshed out. The fitches and the cummin, being
easily got out of their husk or ear, are only threshed with a staff and
a rod; but the bread-corn requires more force, and therefore that must
be bruised with a threshing instrument, a sledge shod with iron, that
was drawn to and fro over it, to beat out the corn; and yet he will not
be ever threshing it, nor any longer than is necessary to loosen the
corn from the chaff; he will not break it, or crush it, into the ground
with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it to pieces with his horsemen;
the grinding of it is reserved for another operation. Observe, by the
way, what pains are to be taken, not only for the earning, but for the
preparing of our necessary food; and yet, after all, it is meat that
perishes. Shall we then grudge to labour much more for the meat which
endures to everlasting life? Bread-corn is bruised. Christ was so; it
pleased the Lord to bruise him, that he might be the bread of life to
us.

II\. The interpretation of the parable is not so plain. Most
interpreters make it a further answer to those who set the judgments of
God at defiance: "Let them know that as the husbandman will not be
always ploughing, but will at length sow his seed, so God will not be
always threatening, but will at length execute his threatenings and
bring upon sinners the judgments they have deserved; but in wisdom, and
in proportion to their strength, not that they may be ruined, but that
they may be reformed and brought to repentance by them." But I think we
may give this parable a greater latitude in the exposition of it. 1. In
general, that God who gives the husbandman this wisdom is, doubtless,
himself infinitely wise. It is God that instructs the husbandman to
discretion, as his God, [Isa 28:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#026.md).
Husbandmen have need of discretion wherewith to order their affairs, and
ought not undertake that business unless they do in some measure
understand it; and they should by observation and experience endeavour
to improve themselves in the knowledge of it. Since the king himself is
served of the field, the advancing of the art of husbandry is a common
service to mankind more than the cultivating of most other arts. The
skill of the husbandman is from God, as every good and perfect gift is.
This takes off somewhat of the weight and terror of the sentence passed
on man for sin, that when God, in execution of it, sent man to till the
ground, he taught him how to do it most to his advantage, otherwise, in
the greatness of his folly, he might have been for ever tilling the sand
of the sea, labouring to no purpose. It is he that gives men capacity
for this business, an inclination to it, and a delight in it; and if
some were not by Providence cut out for it, and mad to rejoice (as
Issachar, that tribe of husbandmen) in their tents, notwithstanding the
toil and fatigue of this business, we should soon want the supports of
life. If some are more discreet and judicious in managing these or any
other affairs than others are, God must be acknowledged in it; and to
him husbandmen must seek for direction in their business, for they,
above other men, have an immediate dependence upon the divine
Providence. As to the other instance of the husbandman's conduct in
threshing his corn, it is said, This also comes forth from the Lord of
hosts, [Isa 28:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#029.md). Even the plainest
dictate of sense and reason must be acknowledged to come forth from the
Lord of hosts. And, if it is from him that men do things wisely and
discreetly, we must needs acknowledge him to be wise in counsel and
excellent in working. God's working is according to his will; he never
acts against his own mind, as men often do, and there is a counsel in
his whole will: he is therefore excellent in working, because he is
wonderful in counsel. 2. God's church is his husbandry, 1 Co. 3. 9 If
Christ is the true vine, his Father is the husbandman ([Joh
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001).md), and he is continually by his
word and ordinances cultivating it. Does the ploughman plough all day,
and break the clods of his ground, that it may receive the seed, and
does not God by his ministers break up the fallow ground? Does not the
ploughman, when the ground is fitted for the seed, cast in the seed in
its proper soil? He does so, and so the great God sows his word by the
hand of his ministers ([Mat 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#019).md),
who are to divide the word of truth and give every one his portion.
Whatever the soil of the heart is, there is some seed or other in the
word proper for it. And, as the word of God, so the rod of God is thus
wisely made use of. Afflictions are God's threshing-instruments,
designed to loosen us from the world, to separate between us and our
chaff, and to prepare us for use. And, as to these, God will make use of
them as there is occasion; but he will proportion them to our strength;
they shall be no heavier than there is need. If the rod and the staff
will answer the end, he will not make use of his cart-wheel and his
horsemen. And where these are necessary, as for the bruising of the
bread-corn (which will not otherwise be got clean from the straw), yet
he will not be ever threshing it, will not always chide, but his anger
shall endure but for a moment; nor will he crush under his feet the
prisoners of the earth. And herein we must acknowledge him wonderful in
counsel and excellent in working.
