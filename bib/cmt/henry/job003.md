### [Job Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 3:0</span></span>

"You have heard of the patience of Job," says the apostle, [Jam
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#011.md). So we have, and of his
impatience too. We wondered that a man should be so patient as he was
(ch. 1 and [Job 2:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001).md), but we wonder
also that a good man should be so impatient as he is in this chapter,
where we find him cursing his day, and, in passion, I. Complaining that
he was born ([Job 3:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#001).md). II.
Complaining that he did not die as soon as he was born ([Job
3:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#011).md). III. Complaining that his
life was now continued when he was in misery ([Job
3:20-26](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#020).md). In this it must be owned
that Job sinned with his lips, and it is written, not for our imitation,
but our admonition, that he who things he stands may take heed lest he
fall.

[Job 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 3:1</span></span>

Long was Job's heart hot within him; and, while he was musing, the fire
burned, and the more for being stifled and suppressed. At length he
spoke with his tongue, but not such a good word as David spoke after a
long pause: Lord, make me to know my end, [Psa
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#003.md), [Psa
39:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#004.md). Seven days the prophet Ezekiel
sat down astonished with the captives, and then (probably on the sabbath
day) the word of the Lord came to him, [Eze
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#015.md), [Eze
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#016.md). So long Job and his friends sat
thinking, but said nothing; they were afraid of speaking what they
thought, lest they should grieve him, and he durst not give vent to his
thoughts, lest he should offend them. They came to comfort him, but,
finding his afflictions very extraordinary, they began to think comfort
did not belong to him, suspecting him to be a hypocrite, and therefore
they said nothing. But losers think they may have leave to speak, and
therefore Job first gives vent to his thoughts. Unless they had been
better, it would however have been well if he had kept them to himself.
In short, he cursed his day, the day of his birth, wished he had never
been born, could not think or speak of his own birth without regret and
vexation. Whereas men usually observe the annual return of their
birthday with rejoicing, he looked upon it as the unhappiest day of the
year, because the unhappiest of his life, being the inlet into all his
woe. Now,

I. This was bad enough. The extremity of his trouble and the
discomposure of his spirits may excuse it in part, but he can by no
means be justified in it. Now he has forgotten the good he was born to,
the lean kine have eaten up the fat ones, and he is filled with thoughts
of the evil only, and wishes he had never been born. The prophet
Jeremiah himself expressed his painful sense of his calamities in
language not much unlike this: Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast
borne me! [Jer 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010.md). Cursed be the
day wherein I was born, [Jer 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014.md),
etc. We may suppose that Job in his prosperity had many a time blessed
God for the day of his birth, and reckoned it a happy day; yet now he
brands it with all possible marks of infamy. When we consider the
iniquity in which we were conceived and born we have reason enough to
reflect with sorrow and shame upon the day of our birth, and to say that
the day of our death, by which we are freed from sin ([Rom
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#007).md), is far better. [Ecc
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001.md). But to curse the day of our birth
because then we entered upon the calamitous scene of life is to quarrel
with the God of nature, to despise the dignity of our being, and to
indulge a passion which our own calm and sober thoughts will make us
ashamed of. Certainly there is no condition of life a man can be in in
this world but he may in it (if it be not his own fault) so honour God,
and work out his own salvation, and make sure a happiness for himself in
a better world, that he will have no reason at all to wish he had never
been born, but a great deal of reason to say that he had his being to
good purpose. Yet it must be owned, if there were not another life after
this, and divine consolations to support us in the prospect of it, so
many are the sorrows and troubles of this that we might sometimes be
tempted to say that we were made in vain ([Psa
89:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#047).md), and to wish we had never been.
There are those in hell who with good reason wish they had never been
born, as Judas, [Mat 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#024.md). But, on
this side hell, there can be no reason for so vain and ungrateful a
wish. It was Job's folly and weakness to curse his day. We must say of
it, This was his infirmity; but good men have sometimes failed in the
exercise of those graces which they have been most eminent for, that we
may understand that when they are said to be perfect it is meant that
they were upright, not that they were sinless. Lastly, Let us observe
it, to the honour of the spiritual life above the natural, that though
many have cursed the day of their first birth, never any cursed the day
of their new-birth, nor wished they never had had grace, and the Spirit
of grace, given them. Those are the most excellent gifts, above life and
being itself, and which will never be a burden.

II\. Yet it was not so bad as Satan promised himself. Job cursed his
day, but he did not curse his God - was weary of his life, and would
gladly have parted with that, but not weary of his religion; he
resolutely cleaves to that, and will never let it go. The dispute
between God and Satan concerning Job was not whether Job had his
infirmities, and whether he was subject to like passions as we are (that
was granted), but whether he was a hypocrite, who secretly hated God,
and if he were provoked, would show his hatred; and, upon trial, it
proved that he was no such man. Nay, all this may consist with his being
a pattern of patience; for, though he did thus speak unadvisedly with
his lips, yet both before and after he expressed great submission and
resignation to the holy will of God and repented of his impatience; he
condemned himself for it, and therefore God did not condemn him, nor
must we, but watch the more carefully over ourselves, lest we sin after
the similitude of this transgression.

1\. The particular expressions which Job used in cursing his day are
full of poetical fancy, flame, and rapture, and create as much
difficulty to the critics as the thing itself does to the divines: we
need not be particular in our observations upon them. When he would
express his passionate wish that he had never been, he falls foul upon
the day, and wishes,

(1.) That earth might forget it: Let it perish ([Job
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#003).md); let it not be joined to the days
of the year, [Job 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#006.md). "Let it be not
only not inserted in the calendar in red letters, as the day of the
king's nativity useth to be" (and Job was a king, [Job
29:25](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#025).md), "but let it be erased and
blotted out, and buried in oblivion. Let not the world know that ever
such a man as I was born into it, and lived in it, who am made such a
spectacle of misery."

(2.) That Heaven might frown upon it: Let not God regard it from above,
[Job 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#004.md). "Every thing is indeed as it
is with God; that day is honourable on which he puts honour, and which
he distinguishes and crowns with his favour and blessing, as he did the
seventh day of the week; but let my birthday never be so honoured; let
it be nigro carbone notandus - marked as with a black coal for an evil
day by him that determines the times before appointed. The father and
fountain of light appointed the greater light to rule the day and the
less lights to rule the night; but let that want the benefit of both."
\[1.\] Let that day be darkness ([Job
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#004).md); and, if the light of the day be
darkness, how great is that darkness! how terrible! because then we look
for light. Let the gloominess of the day represent Job's condition,
whose sun went down at noon. \[2.\] As for that night too, let it want
the benefit of moon and stars, and let darkness seize upon it, thick
darkness, darkness that may be felt, which will not befriend the repose
of the night by its silence, but rather disturb it with its terrors.

(3.) That all joy might forsake it: "Let it be a melancholy night,
solitary, and not a merry night of music and dancing. Let no joyful
voice come therein ([Job 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#007).md); let it
be a long night, and not see the eye-lids of the morning ([Job
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#009).md), which bring joy with them."

(4.) That all curses might follow it ([Job
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#008).md): "Let none ever desire to see it,
or bid it welcome when it comes, but, on the contrary, let those curse
it that curse the day. Whatever day any are tempted to curse, let them
at the same time bestow one curse upon my birthday, particularly those
that make it their trade to raise up mourning at funerals with their
ditties of lamentation. Let those that curse the day of the death of
others in the same breath curse the day of my birth." Or those who are
so fierce and daring as to be ready to raise up the Leviathan (for that
is the word here), who, being about to strike the whale or crocodile,
curse it with the bitterest curse they can invent, hoping by their
incantations to weaken it, and so to make themselves master of it.
Probably some such custom might there be used, to which our divine poet
alludes. "Let it be as odious as the day wherein men bewail the greatest
misfortune, or the time wherein they see the most dreadful apparition;"
so bishop Patrick, I suppose taking the Leviathan here to signify the
devil, as others do, who understand it of the curses used by conjurors
and magicians in raising the devil, or when they have raised a devil
that they cannot lay.

2\. But what is the ground of Job's quarrel with the day and night of
his birth? It is because it shut not up the doors of his mother's womb,
[Job 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#010.md). See the folly and madness
of a passionate discontent, and how absurdly and extravagantly it talks
when the reins are laid on the neck of it. Is this Job, who was so much
admired for his wisdom that unto him men gave ear, and kept silence at
his counsel, and after his words they spoke not again? [Job
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#021.md), [Job
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#011.md). Surely his wisdom failed him,
(1.) When he took so much pains to express his desire that he had never
been born, which, at the best was a vain wish, for it is impossible to
make that which has been not to have been. (2.) When he was so liberal
of his curses upon a day and a night that could not be hurt, or made any
the worse for his curses. (3.) When he wished a thing so very barbarous
to his own mother as that she had not brought him forth when her full
time had come, which must inevitably have been her death, and a
miserable death. (4.) When he despised the goodness of God to him in
giving him a being (such a being, so noble and excellent a life, such a
life, so far above that of any other creature in this lower world), and
undervalued the gift, as not worth the acceptance, only because transit
cum onere - it was clogged with a proviso of trouble, which now at
length came upon him, after many years' enjoyment of its pleasures. What
a foolish thing it was to wish that his eyes had never seen the light,
that so they might not have seen sorrow, which yet he might hope to see
through, and beyond which he might see joy! Did Job believe and hope
that he should in his flesh see God at the latter day ([Job
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#026).md), and yet would he wish he had
never had a being capable of such a bliss, only because, for the
present, he had sorrow in the flesh? God by his grace arm us against
this foolish and hurtful lust of impatience.

[Job 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 3:11</span></span>

Job, perhaps reflecting upon himself for his folly in wishing he had
never been born, follows it, and thinks to mend it, with another, little
better, that he had died as soon as he was born, which he enlarges upon
in these verses. When our Saviour would set forth a very calamitous
state of things he seems to allow such a saying as this, Blessed are the
barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the paps which never gave
suck ([Luk 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#029).md); but blessing the
barren womb is one thing and cursing the fruitful womb is another! It is
good to make the best of afflictions, but it is not good to make the
worst of mercies. Our rule is, Bless, and curse not. Life is often put
for all good, and death for all evil; yet Job here very absurdly
complains of life and its supports as a curse and plague to him, and
covets death and the grave as the greatest and most desirable bliss.
Surely Satan was deceived in Job when he applied that maxim to him, All
that a man hath will he give for his life; for never any man valued life
at a lower rate than he did.

I. He ungratefully quarrels with life, and is angry that it was not
taken from him as soon as it was given him ([Job
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#011.md), [Job
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#012).md): Why died not I from the womb?
See here, 1. What a weak and helpless creature man is when he comes into
the world, and how slender the thread of life is when it is first drawn.
We are ready to die from the womb, and to breathe our last as soon as we
begin to breathe at all. We can do nothing for ourselves, as other
creatures can, but should drop into the grave if the knees did not
prevent us; and the lamp of life, when first lighted, would go out of
itself if the breasts given us, that we should suck, did not supply it
with fresh oil. 2. What a merciful and tender care divine Providence
took of us at our entrance into the world. It was owing to this that we
died not from the womb and did not give up the ghost when we came out of
the belly. Why were we not cut off as soon as we were born? Not because
we did not deserve it. Justly might such weeds have been plucked up as
soon as they appeared; justly might such cockatrices have been crushed
in the egg. Nor was it because we did, or could, take any care of
ourselves and our own safety: no creature comes into the world so
shiftless as man. It was not our might, or the power of our hand, that
preserved us these beings, but God's power and providence upheld our
frail lives, and his pity and patience spared our forfeited lives. It
was owing to this that the knees prevented us. Natural affection is put
into parents' hearts by the hand of the God of nature: and hence it was
that the blessings of the breast attended those of the womb. 3. What a
great deal of vanity and vexation of spirit attends human life. If we
had not a God to serve in this world, and better things to hope for in
another world, considering the faculties we are endued with and the
troubles we are surrounded with, we should be strongly tempted to wish
that we had died from the womb, which would have prevented a great deal
both of sin and misery.

He that is born today, and dies tomorrow,

Loses some hours of joy, but months of sorrow.

4\. The evil of impatience, fretfulness, and discontent. When they thus
prevail they are unreasonable and absurd, impious and ungrateful. To
indulge them is a slighting and undervaluing of God's favour. How much
soever life is embittered, we must say, "It was of the Lord's mercies
that we died not from the womb, that we were not consumed." Hatred of
life is a contradiction to the common sense and sentiments of mankind,
and to our own at any other time. Let discontented people declaim ever
so much against life, they will be loth to part with it when it comes to
the point. When the old man in the fable, being tired with his burden,
threw it down with discontent and called for Death, and Death came to
him and asked him what he would have with him, he then answered,
"Nothing, but to help me up with my burden."

II\. He passionately applauds death and the grave, and seems quite in
love with them. To desire to die that we may be with Christ, that we may
be free from sin, and that we may be clothed upon with our house which
is from heaven, is the effect and evidence of grace; but to desire to
die only that we may be quiet in the grave, and delivered from the
troubles of this life, savours of corruption. Job's considerations here
may be of good use to reconcile us to death when it comes, and to make
us easy under the arrest of it; but they ought not to be made use of as
a pretence to quarrel with life while it is continued, or to make us
uneasy under the burdens of it. It is our wisdom and duty to make the
best of that which is, be it living or dying, and so to live to the Lord
and die to the Lord, and to be his in both, [Rom
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#008.md). Job here frets himself with
thinking that if he had but died as soon as he was born, and been
carried from the womb to the grave, 1. His condition would have been as
good as that of the best: I would have been (says he, [Job
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#014).md) with kings and counsellors of
the earth, whose pomp, power, and policy, cannot set them out of the
reach of death, nor secure them from the grave, nor distinguish theirs
from common dust in the grave. Even princes, who had gold in abundance,
could not with it bribe Death to overlook them when he came with
commission; and, though they filled their houses with silver, yet they
were forced to leave it all behind them, no more to return to it. Some,
by the desolate places which the kings and counsellors are here said to
build for themselves, understand the sepulchres or monuments they
prepared for themselves in their life-time; as Shebna ([Isa
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#016).md) hewed himself out a sepulchre;
and by the gold which the princes had, and the silver with which they
filled their houses, they understand the treasures which, they say, it
was usual to deposit in the graves of great men. Such arts have been
used to preserve their dignity, if possible, on the other side death,
and to keep themselves from lying even with those of inferior rank; but
it will not do: death is, and will be, an irresistible leveller. Mors
sceptra ligonibus aequat - Death mingles sceptres with spades. Rich and
poor meet together in the grave; and there a hidden untimely birth ([Job
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#016).md), a child that either never saw
light or but just opened its eyes and peeped into the world, and, not
liking it, closed them again and hastened out of it, lies as soft and
easy, lies as high and safe, as kings and counsellors, and princes, that
had gold. "And therefore," says Job, "would I had lain there in the
dust, rather than to lie here in the ashes!" 2. His condition would have
been much better than now it was ([Job
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#013).md): "Then should I have lain still,
and been quiet, which now I cannot do, I cannot be, but am still tossing
and unquiet; then I should have slept, whereas now sleep departeth from
my eyes; then had I been at rest, whereas now I am restless." Now that
life and immortality are brought to a much clearer light by the gospel
than before they were placed in good Christians can give a better
account than this of the gain of death: "Then should I have been present
with the Lord; then should I have seen his glory face to face, and no
longer through a glass darkly." But all that poor Job dreamed of was
rest and quietness in the grave out of the fear of evil tidings and out
of the feeling of sore boils. Then should I have been quiet; and had he
kept his temper, his even easy temper still, which he was in as recorded
in the two foregoing chapters, entirely resigned to the holy will of God
and acquiescing in it, he might have been quiet now; his soul, at least,
might have dwelt at ease, even when his body lay in pain, [Psa
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#013.md). Observe how finely he describes
the repose of the grave, which (provided the soul also be at rest in
God) may much assist our triumphs over it. (1.) Those that now are
troubled will there be out of the reach of trouble ([Job
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#017).md): There the wicked cease from
troubling. When persecutors die they can no longer persecute; their
hatred and envy will then perish. Herod had vexed the church, but, when
he became a prey for worms, he ceased from troubling. When the
persecuted die they are out of the danger of being any further troubled.
Had Job been at rest in his grave, he would have had no disturbance from
the Sabeans and Chaldeans, none of all his enemies would have created
him any trouble. (2.) Those that are now toiled will there see the
period of their toils. There the weary are at rest. Heaven is more than
a rest to the souls of the saints, but the grave is a rest to their
bodies. Their pilgrimage is a weary pilgrimage; sin and the world they
are weary of; their services, sufferings, and expectations, they are
wearied with; but in the grave they rest from all their labours, [Rev
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013.md); [Isa
57:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#002.md). They are easy there, and make no
complaints; there believers sleep in Jesus. (3.) Those that were here
enslaved are there at liberty. Death is the prisoner's discharge, the
relief of the oppressed, and the servant's manumission ([Job
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#018).md): There the prisoners, though
they walk not at large, yet they rest together, and are not put to work,
to grind in that prison-house. They are no more insulted and trampled
upon, menaced and terrified, by their cruel task-masters: They hear not
the voice of the oppressor. Those that were here doomed to perpetual
servitude, that could call nothing their own, no, not their own bodies,
are there no longer under command or control: There the servant is free
from his master, which is a good reason why those that have power should
use it moderately, and those that are in subjection should bear it
patiently, yet a little while. (4.) Those that were at a vast distance
from others are there upon a level ([Job
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#019).md): The small and great are there,
there the same, there all one, all alike free among the dead. The
tedious pomp and state which attend the great are at an end there. All
the inconveniences of a poor and low condition are likewise over; death
and the grave know no difference.

Levelled by death, the conqueror and the slave,

The wise and foolish, cowards and the brave,

Lie mixed and undistinguished in the grave.

\- Sir R. Blackmore

[Job 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 3:20</span></span>

Job, finding it to no purpose to wish either that he had not been born
or had died as soon as he was born, here complains that his life was now
continued and not cut off. When men are set on quarrelling there is no
end of it; the corrupt heart will carry on the humour. Having cursed the
day of his birth, here he courts the day of his death. The beginning of
this strife and impatience is as the letting forth of water.

I. He thinks it hard, in general, that miserable lives should be
prolonged ([Job 3:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#020).md): Wherefore is
light in life given to those that are bitter in soul? Bitterness of
soul, through spiritual grievances, makes life itself bitter. Why doth
he give light? (so it is in the original): he means God, yet does not
name him, though the devil had said, "He will curse thee to thy face;"
but he tacitly reflects on the divine Providence as unjust and unkind in
continuing life when the comforts of life are removed. Life is called
light, because pleasant and serviceable for walking and working. It is
candle-light; the longer it burns the shorter it is, and the nearer to
the socket. This light is said to be given us; for, if it were not daily
renewed to us by a fresh gift, it would be lost. But Job reckons that to
those who are in misery it is dōron adōron - gift and no gift, a gift
that they had better be without, while the light only serves them to see
their own misery by. Such is the vanity of human life that it sometimes
becomes a vexation of spirit; and so alterable is the property of death
that, though dreadful to nature, it may become desirable even to nature
itself. He here speaks of those, 1. Who long for death, when they have
out-lived their comforts and usefulness, are burdened with age and
infirmities, with pain or sickness, poverty or disgrace, and yet it
comes not; while, at the same time, it comes to many who dread it and
would put it far from them. The continuance and period of life must be
according to God's will, not according to ours. It is not fit that we
should be consulted how long we would live and when we would die; our
times are in a better hand than our own. 2. Who dig for it as for hidden
treasures, that is, would give any thing for a fair dismission out of
this world, which supposes that then the thought of men's being their
own executioners was not so much as entertained or suggested, else those
who longed for it needed not take much pains for it, they might soon
come at it (as Seneca tells them) if they are pleased. 3. Who bid it
welcome, and are glad when they can find the grave and see themselves
stepping into it. If the miseries of this life can prevail, contrary to
nature, to make death itself desirable, shall not much more the hopes
and prospects of a better life, to which death is our passage, make it
so, and set us quite above the fear of it? It may be a sin to long for
death, but I am sure it is no sin to long for heaven.

II\. He thinks himself, in particular, hardly dealt with, that he might
not be eased of his pain and misery by death when he could not get ease
in any other way. To be thus impatient of life for the sake of the
troubles we meet with is not only unnatural in itself, but ungrateful to
the giver of life, and argues a sinful indulgence of our own passion and
a sinful inconsideration of our future state. Let it be our great and
constant care to get ready for another world, and then let us leave it
to God to order the circumstances of our removal thither as he thinks
fit: "Lord, when and how thou pleasest;" and this with such an
indifference that, if he should refer it to us, we would refer it to him
again. Grace teaches us, in the midst of life's greatest comforts, to be
willing to die, and, in the midst of its greatest crosses, to be willing
to live. Job, to excuse himself in this earnest desire which he had to
die, pleads the little comfort and satisfaction he had in life.

1\. In his present afflicted state troubles were continually felt, and
were likely to be so. He thought he had cause enough to be weary of
living, for, (1.) He had no comfort of his life: My sighing comes before
I eat, [Job 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#024.md). The sorrows of life
prevented and anticipated the supports of life; nay, they took away his
appetite for his necessary food. His griefs returned as duly as his
meals, and affliction was his daily bread. Nay, so great was the
extremity of his pain and anguish that he did not only sigh, but roar,
and his roarings were poured out like the waters in a full and constant
stream. Our Master was acquainted with grief, and we must expect to be
so too. (2.) He had no prospect of bettering his condition: His way was
hidden, and God had hedged him in, [Job
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#023.md). He saw no way open of
deliverance, nor knew he what course to take; his way was hedged up with
thorns, that he could not find his path. See [Job
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#008.md); [Lam
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#007.md).

2\. Even in his former prosperous state troubles were continually
feared; so that then he was never easy, [Job
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#025.md), [Job
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#026.md). He knew so much of the vanity of
the world, and the troubles to which, of course, he was born, that he
was not in safety, neither had he rest then. That which made his grief
now the more grievous was that he was not conscious to himself of any
great degree either of negligence or security in the day of his
prosperity, which might provoke God thus to chastise him. (1.) He had
not been negligent and unmindful of his affairs, but kept up such a fear
of trouble as was necessary to the maintaining of his guard. He was
afraid for his children when they were feasting, lest they should offend
God ([Job 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#005).md), afraid for his
servants lest they should offend his neighbours; he took all the care he
could of his own health, and managed himself and his affairs with all
possible precaution; yet all would not do. (2.) He had not been secure,
nor indulged himself in ease and softness, had not trusted in his
wealth, nor flattered himself with the hopes of the perpetuity of his
mirth; yet trouble came, to convince and remind him of the vanity of the
world, which yet he had not forgotten when he lived at ease. Thus his
way was hidden, for he knew not wherefore God contended with him. Now
this consideration, instead of aggravating his grief, might rather serve
to alleviate it. Nothing will make trouble easy so much as the testimony
of our consciences for us, that, in some measure, we did our duty in a
day of prosperity; and an expectation of trouble will make it sit the
lighter when it comes. The less it is a surprise the less it is a
terror.
