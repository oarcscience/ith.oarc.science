### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 15:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have the final rejection of Saul from being king, for
his disobedience to God's command in not utterly destroying the
Amalekites. By his wars and victories he hoped to magnify and perpetuate
his own name and honour, but, by his mismanagement of them, he ruined
himself, and laid his honour in the dust. Here is, I. The commission God
gave him to destroy the Amalekites, with a command to do it utterly
([Sa1 15:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#001).md). II. Saul's preparation
for this expedition ([Sa1 15:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#004).md).
III. His success, and partial execution of this commission ([Sa1
15:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#007).md). IV. His examination before
Samuel, and sentence passed upon him, notwithstanding the many frivolous
pleas he made to excuse himself (v. 10-31). V. The slaying of Agag ([Sa1
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#032.md), [Sa1
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#033).md). VI. Samuel's final farewell to
Saul ([Sa1 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#034.md), [Sa1
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#035).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 15:1</span></span>

Here, I. Samuel, in God's name, solemnly requires Saul to be obedient to
the command of God, and plainly intimates that he was now about to put
him upon a trial, in one particular instance, whether he would be
obedient or no, [Sa1 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#001.md). And the
making of this so expressly the trial of his obedience did very much
aggravate his disobedience. 1. He reminds him of what God had done for
him: "The Lord sent me to anoint thee to be a king. God gave thee thy
power, and therefore he expects thou shouldst use thy power for him. He
put honour upon thee, and now thou must study how to do him honour. He
made thee king over Israel, and now thou must plead Israel's cause and
avenge their quarrels. Thou art advanced to command Israel, but know
that thou art a subject to the God of Israel and must be commanded by
him." Men's preferment, instead of releasing them from their obedience
to God, obliges them so much the more to it. Samuel had himself been
employed to anoint Saul, and therefore was the fitter to be send with
these orders to him. 2. He tells him, in general, that, in consideration
of this, whatever God commanded him to do he was bound to do it: Now
therefore hearken to the voice of the Lord. Note, God's favours to us
lay strong obligations upon us to be obedient to him. This we must
render, [Psa 116:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#012.md).

II\. He appoints him a particular piece of service, in which he must now
show his obedience to God more than in any thing he had done yet. Samuel
premises God's authority to the command: Thus says the Lord of hosts,
the Lord of all hosts, of Israel's hosts. He also gives him a reason for
the command, that the severity he must use might not seem hard: I
remember that which Amalek did to Israel, [Sa1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#002.md). God had an ancient quarrel with
the Amalekites, for the injuries they did to his people Israel when he
brought them out of Egypt. We have the story, [Exo
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008.md), etc., and the crime is
aggravated, [Deu 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#018.md). He basely
smote the hindmost of them, and feared not God. God then swore that he
would have war with Amalek from generation to generation, and that in
process of time he would utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek; this
is the work that Saul is now appointed to do ([Sa1
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003).md): "Go and smite Amalek. Israel is
now strong, and the measure of the iniquity of Amalek is now full; now
go and make a full riddance of that devoted nation." He is expressly
commanded to kill and slay all before him, man and woman, infant and
suckling, and not spare them out of pity; also ox and sheep, camel and
ass, and not spare them out of covetousness. Note, 1. Injuries done to
God's Israel will certainly be reckoned for sooner or later, especially
the opposition given them when they are coming out of Egypt. 2. God
often bears long with those that are marked for ruin. The sentence
passed is not executed speedily. 3. Though he bear long, he will not
bear always. The year of recompence for the controversy of Israel will
come at last. Though divine justice strikes slowly it strikes surely. 4.
The longer judgment is delayed many times the more severe it is when it
comes. 5. God chooses out instruments to do his work that are fittest
for it. This was bloody work, and therefore Saul who was a rough and
severe man must do it.

III\. Saul hereupon musters his forces, and makes a descent upon the
country of Amalek. It was an immense army that he brought into the field
([Sa1 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#004).md): 200,000 footmen. When he
came to engage the Philistines, and the success was hazardous, he had
but 600 attending him, [Sa1 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#015.md). But
now that he was to attack the Amalekites by express order from heaven,
in which he was sure of victory, he had thousands at his call. But,
whatever it was at other times, it was not now for the honour of Judah
that their forces were numbered by themselves, for their quota was
scandalously short (whatever was the reason), but a twentieth part of
the whole, for they were by 10,000, when the other ten tribes (for I
except Levi) brought into the field 200,000. The day of Judah's honour
drew near, but had not yet come. Saul numbered them in Telaim, which
signifies lambs. He numbered then like lambs (so the vulgar Latin),
numbered them by the paschal lambs (so the Chaldee), allowing ten to a
lamb, a way of numbering used by the Jews in the later times of their
nation. Saul drew all his forces to the city of Amalek, that city that
was their metropolis ([Sa1 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#005).md), that
he might provoke them to give him battle.

IV\. He gave friendly advice to the Kenites to separate themselves from
the Amalekites among whom they dwelt, while this execution was in doing,
[Sa1 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006.md). Herein he did prudently and
piously, and, it is probable, according to the direction Samuel gave
him. The Kenites were of the family and kindred of Jethro, Moses's
father-in-law, a people that dwelt in tents, which made it easy for
them, upon every occasion, to remove to other lands not appropriated.
Many of them, at this time, dwelt among the Amalekites, where, though
they dwelt in tents, they were fortified by nature, for they put their
nest in a rock, being hardy people that could live any where, and
affected fastnesses, [Num 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#021.md).
Balaam had foretold that they should be wasted, [Num
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#022.md). However, Saul must not waste
them. But, 1. He acknowledges the kindness of their ancestors to Israel,
when they came out of Egypt. Jethro and his family had been very helpful
and serviceable to them in their passage through the wilderness, had
been to them instead of eyes, and this is remembered to their posterity
many ages after. Thus a good man leaves the divine blessing for an
inheritance to his children's children; those that come after us may be
reaping the benefit of our good works when we are in our graves. God is
not unrighteous to forget the kindnesses shown to his people; but they
shall be remembered another day, at furthest in the great day, and
recompensed in the resurrection of the just. I was hungry, and you gave
me meat. God's remembering the kindness of the Kenites' ancestors in
favour to them, at the same time when he was punishing the injuries done
by the ancestors of the Amalekites, helped to clear the righteousness of
God in that dispensation. If he entail favours, why may he not entail
frowns? He espouses his people's cause, so as to bless those that bless
them; and therefore so as to curse those that curse them, [Num
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#009.md); [Gen
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003.md). They cannot themselves requite
the kindnesses nor avenge the injuries done them, but God will do both.
2. He desires them to remove their tents from among the Amalekites: Go,
depart, get you down from among them. When destroying judgments are
abroad God will take care to separate between the precious and the vile,
and to hide the meek of the earth in the day of his anger. It is
dangerous being found in the company of God's enemies, and it is our
duty and interest to come out from among them, lest we share in their
sins and plagues, [Rev 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004.md). The Jews
have a saying, Woe to the wicked man and woe to his neighbour.

V. Saul prevailed against the Amalekites, for it was rather an execution
of condemned malefactors than a war with contending enemies. The issue
could not be dubious when the cause was just and the call so clear: He
smote them ([Sa1 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#007).md), utterly
destroyed them, [Sa1 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#008.md). Now they
paid dearly for the sin of their ancestors. God sometimes lays up
iniquity for the children. They were idolaters, and were guilty of many
other sins, for which they deserved to fall under the wrath of God; yet,
when God would reckon with them, he fastened upon the sin of their
ancestors in abusing his Israel as the ground of his quarrel. Lord, How
unsearchable are thy judgments, yet how incontestable is thy
righteousness!

VI\. Yet he did his work by halves, [Sa1
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#009.md). 1. He spared Agag, because he
was a king like himself, and perhaps in hope to get a great ransom for
him. 2. He spared the best of the cattle, and destroyed only the refuse,
that was good for little. Many of the people, we may suppose, made their
escape, and took their effects with them into other countries, and
therefore we read of Amalekites after this; but that could not be
helped. It was Saul's fault that he did not destroy such as came to his
hands and were in his power. That which was now destroyed was in effect
sacrificed to the justice of God, as the God to whom vengeance
belongeth; and for Saul to think the torn and the sick, the lame and the
lean, good enough for that, while he reserved for his own fields and his
own table the firstlings and the fat, was really to honour himself more
than God.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 15:10</span></span>

Saul is here called to account by Samuel concerning the execution of his
commission against the Amalekites; and remarkable instances we are here
furnished with of the strictness of the justice of God and the treachery
and deceitfulness of the heart of man. We are here told,

I. What passed between God and Samuel, in secret, upon this occasion,
[Sa1 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#010.md), [Sa1
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#011.md). 1. God determines Saul's
rejection, and acquaints Samuel with it: It repenteth me that I have set
up Saul to be king. Repentance in God is not, as it is in us, a change
of his mind, but a change of his method or dispensation. He does not
alter his will, but wills an alteration. The change was in Saul: He has
turned back from following me; this construction God put upon the
partiality of his obedience, and the prevalency of his covetousness. And
hereby he did himself make God his enemy. God repented that he had given
Saul the kingdom and the honour and power that belonged to it: but he
never repented that he had given any man wisdom and grace, and his fear
and love; these gifts and callings of God are without repentance. 2.
Samuel laments and deprecates it. It grieved Samuel that Saul had
forfeited God's favour, and that God had resolved to cast him off; and
he cried unto the Lord all night, spent a whole night in interceding for
him, that this decree might not go forth against him. When others were
in their beds sleeping, he was upon his knees praying and wrestling with
God. He did not thus deprecate his own exclusion from the government;
nor was he secretly pleased, as many a one would have been, that Saul,
who succeeded him, was so soon laid aside, but on the contrary prayed
earnestly for his establishment, so far was he from desiring that woeful
day. The rejection of sinners is the grief of good people; God delights
not in their death, nor should we.

II\. What passed between Samuel and Saul in public. Samuel, being sent
of God to him with these heavy tidings, went, as Ezekiel, in bitterness
of soul, to meet him, perhaps according to an appointment when Saul went
forth on this expedition, for Saul had come to Gilgal ([Sa1
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#012).md), the place where he was made
king ([Sa1 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#015).md), and were now he
would have been confirmed if he had approved himself well in the trial
of his obedience. But Samuel was informed that Saul had set up a
triumphal arch, or some monument of his victory, at Carmel, a city in
the mountains of Judah, seeking his own honour more than the honour of
God, for he set up this place (or hand, as the word is) for himself (he
had more need to have been repenting of his sin and making his peace
with God than boasting of his victory), and also that he had marched in
great state to Gilgal, for this seems to be intimated in the manner of
expression: He has gone about, and passed on, and gone down, with a
great deal of pomp and parade. There Samuel gave him the meeting, and,

1\. Saul makes his boast to Samuel of his obedience, because that was
the thing by which he was now to signalize himself ([Sa1
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#013).md): "Blessed be thou of the Lord,
for thou sendest me upon a good errand, in which I have had great
success, and I have performed the commandment of the Lord." It is very
likely, if his conscience had now flown in his face at this time and
charged him with disobedience, he would not have been so forward to
proclaim his disobedience; for by this he hoped to prevent Samuel's
reproving him. Thus sinners think, by justifying themselves, to escape
being judged of the Lord; whereas the only way to do that is by judging
ourselves. Those that boast most of their religion may be suspected of
partiality and hypocrisy in it.

2\. Samuel convicts him by a plain demonstration of his disobedience.
"Hast thou performed the commandment of the Lord? What means then the
bleating of the sheep?" [Sa1 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#014.md).
Saul would needs have it thought than God Almighty was wonderfully
beholden to him for the good service he had done; but Samuel shows him
that God was so far from being a debtor to him that he had just cause of
action against him, and produces for evidence the bleating of the sheep,
and the lowing of the oxen, which perhaps Saul appointed to bring up the
rear of his triumph, but Samuel appears to them as witnesses against
him. He needed not go far to disprove his professions. The noise the
cattle made (like the rust of silver, [Jam
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#003).md) would be a witness against him.
Note, It is no new thing for the plausible professions and protestations
of hypocrites to be contradicted and disproved by the most plain and
undeniable evidence. Many boast of their obedience to the command of
God; but what mean then their indulgence of the flesh, their love of the
world, their passion and uncharitableness, and their neglect of holy
duties, which witness against them?

3\. Saul insists upon his own justification against this charge, [Sa1
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#015.md). The fact he cannot deny; the
sheep and oxen were brought from the Amalekites. But, (1.) It was not
his fault, for the people spared them; as if they durst have done it
without the express orders of Saul, when they knew it was against the
express orders of Samuel. Note, Those that are willing to justify
themselves are commonly very forward to condemn others, and to lay the
blame upon any rather than take it to themselves. Sin is a brat that
nobody cares to have laid at his doors. It is the sorry subterfuge of an
impenitent heart, that will not confess its guilt, to lay the blame on
those that were tempters, or partners, or only followers in it. (2.) It
was with a good intention: "It was to sacrifice to the Lord thy God. He
is thy God, and thou wilt not be against any thing that is done, as this
is, for his honour." This was a false plea, for both Saul and the people
designed their own profit in sparing the cattle. But, if it had been
true, it would still have been frivolous, for God hates robbery for
burnt-offering. God appointed these cattle to be sacrificed to him in
the field, and therefore will give those no thanks that bring them to be
sacrificed at his altar; for he will be served in his own way, and
according to the rule he himself has prescribed. Nor will a good
intention justify a bad action.

4\. Samuel overrules, or rather overlooks, his plea, and proceeds, in
God's name, to give judgment against him. He premises his authority.
What he was about to say was what the Lord had said to him ([Sa1
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#016).md), otherwise he would have been
far from passing so severe a censure upon him. Those who complain that
their ministers are too harsh with them should remember that, while they
keep to the word of God, they are but messengers, and must say as they
are bidden, and therefore be willing, as Saul himself here was, that
they should say on. Samuel delivers his message faithfully. (1.) He
reminds Saul of the honour of God had done him in making him king ([Sa1
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#017).md), when he was little in his own
sight. God regarded the lowness of his state and rewarded the lowliness
of his spirit. Note, Those that are advanced to honour and wealth ought
often to remember their mean beginnings, that they may never think
highly of themselves, but always study to do great things for the God
that had advanced them. (2.) He lays before him the plainness of the
orders he was to execute ([Sa1 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#018).md):
The Lord sent thee on a journey; so easy was the service, and so certain
the success, that it was rather to be called a journey than a war. The
work was honourable, to destroy the sworn enemies of God and Israel; and
had he denied himself, and set aside the consideration of his own profit
so far as to have destroyed all that belonged to Amalek, he would have
been no loser by it at last, nor have gone this warfare on his own
charges. God would no doubt have made it up to him, so that he should
have no need of spoil. And therefore, (3.) He shows him how inexcusable
he was in aiming to make a profit of this expedition, and to enrich
himself by it ([Sa1 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#019).md): "Wherefore
then didst thou fly upon the spoil, and convert that to thy own use
which was to have been destroyed for God's honour?" See what evil the
love of money is the root of; but see what is the sinfulness of sin, and
that in it which above any thing else makes it evil in the sight of the
Lord. It is disobedience: Thou didst not obey the voice of the Lord.

5\. Saul repeats his vindication of himself, as that which, in defiance
of conviction, he resolved to abide by, [Sa1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#020.md), [Sa1
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#021.md). He denies the charge ([Sa1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#020).md): "Yea, I have obeyed, I have
done all I should do;" for he had done all which he thought he needed to
do, so much wiser was he in his own eyes than God himself. God bade him
kill all, and yet he puts in among the instances of his obedience that
he brought Agag alive, which he thought was as good as if he had killed
him. Thus carnal deceitful hearts think to excuse themselves from God's
commandments with their own equivalents. He insists upon it that he has
utterly destroyed the Amalekites themselves, which was the main thing
intended; but, as to the spoil, he owns it should have been utterly
destroyed; so that he knew his Lord's will, and was under no mistake
about the command. But he thought that would be wilful waste; the cattle
of the Midianites was taken for a prey in Moses's time ([Num
31:32](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#032), etc..md), and why not the cattle
of the Amalekites now? Better it should be prey to the Israelites than
to the fowls of the air and the wild beasts; and therefore he connived
at the people's carrying it away. But it was their doing and not his;
and, besides, it was for sacrifice to the Lord here at Gilgal, whither
they were now bringing them. See what a hard thing it is to convince the
children of disobedience of their sin and to strip them of their
fig-leaves.

6\. Samuel gives a full answer to his apology, since he did insist upon
it, [Sa1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md), [Sa1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#023.md). He appeals to his own
conscience: Has the Lord as great delight in sacrifices as in obedience?
Though Saul was not a man of any great acquaintance with religion, yet
he could not but know this, (1.) That nothing is so pleasing to God as
obedience, no, not sacrifice and offering, and the fat of rams. See here
what we should seek and aim at in all the exercises of religion, even
acceptance with God, that he may delight in what we do. If God be well
pleased with us and our services, we are happy, we have gained our
point, but otherwise to what purpose is it? [Isa
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011.md). Now here we are plainly told
that humble, sincere, and conscientious obedience to the will of God, is
more pleasing and acceptable to him than all burnt-offerings and
sacrifices. A careful conformity to moral precepts recommends us to God
more than all ceremonial observances, [Mic
6:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006.md); [Hos
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006.md). Obedience is enjoyed by the
eternal law of nature, but sacrifice only by a positive law. Obedience
was the law of innocency, but sacrifice supposes sin come into the
world, and is but a feeble attempt to take that away which obedience
would have prevented. God is more glorified and self more denied by
obedience than by sacrifice. It is much easier to bring a bullock or
lamb to be burnt upon the altar than to bring every high thought into
obedience to God and the will subject to his will. Obedience is the
glory of angels ([Psa 103:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#020).md), and it
will be ours. (2.) That nothing is so provoking to God as disobedience,
setting up our wills in competition with his. This is here called
rebellion and stubbornness, and is said to be as bad as witchcraft and
idolatry, [Sa1 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#023.md). It is as bad to
set up other gods as to live in disobedience to the true God. Those that
are governed by their own corrupt inclinations, in opposition to the
command of God, do, in effect, consult the teraphim (as the word here is
for idolatry) or the diviners. It was disobedience that made us all
sinners ([Rom 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#019).md), and this is the
malignity of sin, that it is the transgression of the law, and
consequently it is enmity to God, [Rom
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#007.md). Saul was a king, but if he
disobey the command of God, his royal dignity and power will not excuse
him from the guilt of rebellion and stubbornness. It is not the
rebellion of the people against their prince, but of a prince against
God, that this text speaks of.

7\. He reads his doom: in short, "Because thou has rejected the word of
the Lord, hast despised it (so the Chaldee), hast made nothing of it (so
the Septuagint), hast cast off the government of it, therefore he has
rejected thee, despised and made nothing of thee, but cast thee off from
being king. He that made thee king has determined to unmake thee again."
Those are unfit and unworthy to rule over men who are not willing that
God should rule over them.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 15:24</span></span>

Saul is at length brought to put himself into the dress of the penitent;
but it is too evident that he only acts the part of a penitent, and is
not one indeed. Observe,

I. How poorly he expressed his repentance. It was with much ado that he
was made sensible of his fault, and not till he was threatened with
being deposed. This touched him in a tender part. Then he began to
relent, and not till then. When Samuel told him he was rejected from
being king, then he said, I have sinned, [Sa1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#024.md). His confession was not free nor
ingenuous, but extorted by the rack, and forced from him. We observe
here several bad signs of the hypocrisy of his repentance, and that it
came short even of Ahab's. 1. He made his application to Samuel only,
and seemed most solicitous to stand right in his opinion and to gain his
favour. He makes a little god of him, only to preserve his reputation
with the people, because they all knew Samuel to be a prophet, and the
man that had been the instrument of his preferment. Thinking it would
please Samuel, and be a sort of bribe to him, he puts it into his
confession: I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord and thy
word; as if he had been in God's stead, [Sa1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#024.md). David, though convinced by the
ministry of Nathan, yet, in his confession, has his eye to God alone,
not to Nathan. [Psa 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004.md) Against thee
only have I sinned. But Saul, ignorantly enough, confesses his sin as a
transgression of Samuel's word; whereas his word was no other than a
declaration of the commandment of the Lord. He also applies to Samuel
for forgiveness ([Sa1 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#025).md): I pray
thee, pardon my sin; as if any could forgive sin but God only. Those
wretchedly deceive themselves who, when they have fallen into scandalous
sin, think it enough to make their peace with the church and their
ministers, by the show and plausible profession of repentance, without
taking care to make their peace with God by the sincerity of it. The
most charitable construction we can put upon this of Saul is to suppose
that he looked upon Samuel as a sort of mediator between him and God,
and intended an address to God in his application to him. However, it
was very weak. 2. He excused his fault even in the confession of it, and
that is never the fashion of a true penitent ([Sa1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#024).md): I did it because I feared the
people, and obeyed their voice. We have reason enough to think that it
was purely his own doing and not the people's; however, if they were
forward to do it, it is plain, by what we have read before, that he knew
how to keep up his authority among them and did not stand in any awe of
them. So that the excuse was false and frivolous; whatever he pretended,
he did not really fear the people. But it is common for sinners, in
excusing their faults, to plead the thoughts and workings of their own
minds, because those are things which, how groundless soever, no man can
disprove; but they forget that God searchest the heart. 3. All his care
was to save his credit, and preserve his interest in the people, lest
they should revolt from him, or at least despise him. Therefore he
courts Samuel with so much earnestness ([Sa1
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#025).md) to turn again with him, and
assist in a public thanksgiving for the victory. Very importunate he was
in this matter when he laid hold on the skirt of his mantle to detain
him ([Sa1 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#027).md), not that he cared
for Samuel, but he feared that if Samuel forsook him the people would do
so too. Many seem zealously affected to good ministers and good people
only for the sake of their own interest and reputation, while in heart
they hate them. But his expression was very gross when he said ([Sa1
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#030).md), I have sinned, yet honour me,
I pray thee, before my people. Is this the language of a penitent? No,
but the contrary: "I have sinned, shame me now, for to me belongs shame,
and no man can loathe me so much as I loathe myself." Yet how often do
we meet with the copies of this hypocrisy of Saul! It is very common for
those who are convicted of sin to show themselves very solicitous to be
honoured before the people. Whereas he that has lost the honour of an
innocent can pretend to no other than that of a penitent, and it is the
honour of a penitent to take shame to himself.

II\. How little he got by these thin shows of repentance. What point did
he gain by them? 1. Samuel repeated the sentence passed upon him, so far
was he from giving any hopes of the repeal of it, [Sa1
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#026.md), the same with [Sa1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#023.md). He that covers his sins shall
never prosper, [Pro 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#013.md). Samuel
refused to turn back with him, but turned about to go away, [Sa1
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#027.md). As the thing appeared to him
upon the first view, he thought it altogether unfit for him so far to
countenance one whom God had rejected as to join with him in giving
thanks to God for a victory which was made to serve rather Saul's
covetousness than God's glory. Yet afterwards he did turn again with him
([Sa1 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#031).md), upon further thoughts,
and probably by divine direction, either to prevent a mutiny among the
people or perhaps not to do honour to Saul (for, though Saul worshipped
the Lord, [Sa1 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#031.md), it is not said
Samuel presided in that worship), but to do justice on Agag, [Sa1
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#032.md). 2. He illustrated the sentence
by a sign, which Saul himself, by his rudeness, gave occasion for. When
Samuel was turning from him he tore his clothes to detain him ([Sa1
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#027).md), so loth was he to part with
the prophet; but Samuel put a construction upon this accident which none
but a prophet could do. He made it to signify the rending of the kingdom
from him ([Sa1 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#028).md), and that, like
this, was his own doing. "He hath rent it from thee, and given it to a
neighbour better than thou," namely, to David, who afterwards, upon
occasion, cut off the skirt of Saul's robe ([Sa1
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#004).md), upon which Saul said ([Sa1
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#020).md), I know that thou shalt surely
be king, perhaps remembering this sign, the tearing of the skirt of
Samuel's mantle. 3. He ratified it by a solemn declaration of its being
irreversible ([Sa1 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#029).md): The
Strength of Israel will not lie. The Eternity or Victory of Israel, so
some read it; the holy One, so the Arabic; the most noble One, so the
Syriac; the triumphant King of Israel, so bishop Patrick. "He is
determined to depose thee, and he will not change his purpose. He is not
a man that should repent." Men are fickle and alter their minds, feeble
and cannot effect their purposes; something happens which they could not
foresee, by which their measures are broken. But with God it is not so.
God has sometimes repented of the evil which he thought to have done,
repentance was hidden from Saul, and therefore hidden from God's eyes.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">sa1 15:32</span></span>

Samuel, as a prophet, is here set over kings, [Jer
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010.md).

I. He destroys king Agag, doubtless by such special direction from
heaven as none now can pretend to. He hewed Agag in pieces. Some think
he only ordered it to be done; or perhaps he did it with his own hands,
as a sacrifice to God's injured justice ([Sa1
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#033).md), and sacrifices used to be cut
in pieces. Now observe in this,

1\. How Agag's present vain hopes were frustrated: He came delicately,
in a stately manner, to show that he was a king, and therefore to be
treated with respect, or in a soft effeminate manner, as one never used
to hardship, that could not set the sole of his foot to the ground for
tenderness and delicacy ([Deu 28:56](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#056).md),
to move compassion: and he said, "Surely, now that the heat of the
battle is over, the bitterness of death is past, [Sa1
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#032.md). Having escaped the sword of
Saul," that man of war, he thought he was in no danger from Samuel, and
old prophet, a man of peace. Note, (1.) There is bitterness in death, it
is terrible to nature. Surely death is bitter, so divers versions read
those words of Agag; as the Septuagint read the former clause, He came
trembling. Death will dismay the stoutest heart. (2.) Many think the
bitterness of death is past when it is not so; they put that evil day
far from them which is very near. True believers may, through grace, say
this, upon good grounds, though death be not past, the bitterness of it
is. O death! where is thy sting?

2\. How his former wicked practices were now punished. Samuel calls him
to account, not only for the sins of his ancestors, but his own sins:
Thy sword has made women childless, [Sa1
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#033.md). He trod in the steps of his
ancestors' cruelty, and those under him, it is likely, did the same;
justly therefore is all the righteous blood shed by Amalek required of
this generation, [Mat 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#036.md). Agag,
that was delicate and luxurious himself, was cruel and barbarous to
others. It is commonly so: those who are indulgent in their appetites
are not less indulgent of their passions. But blood will be reckoned
for; even kings must account to the King of kings for the guiltless
blood they shed or cause to be shed. It was that crime of king Manasseh
which the Lord would not pardon, [Kg2
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#004.md). See [Rev
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#010.md).

II\. He deserts king Saul, takes leave of him ([Sa1
15:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#034).md), and never came any more to see
him ([Sa1 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#035).md), to advise or assist
him in any of his affairs, because Saul did not desire his company nor
would he be advised by him. He looked upon him as rejected of God, and
therefore he forsook him. Though he might sometimes see him accidentally
(as [Sa1 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#024).md), yet he never came to
see him out of kindness or respect. Yet he mourned for Saul, thinking it
a very lamentable thing that a man who stood so fair for great things
should ruin himself so foolishly. He mourned for the bad state of the
country, to which Saul was likely to have been so great a blessing, but
now would prove a curse and a plague. He mourned for his everlasting
state, having no hopes of bringing him to repentance. When he wept for
him, it is likely, he made supplication, but the Lord had repented that
he had made Saul king, and resolved to undo that work of his, so that
Samuel's prayers prevailed not for him. Observe, We must mourn for the
rejection of sinners, 1. Though we withdraw from them, and dare not
converse familiarly with them. Thus the prophet determines to leave his
people and go from them, and yet to weep day and night for them, [Jer
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001.md), [Jer
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#002.md). 2. Though they do not mourn for
themselves. Saul seems unconcerned at the tokens of God's displeasure
which he lay under, and yet Samuel mourns day and night for him.
Jerusalem was secure when Christ wept over it.
