### [Psalms Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 13:0</span></span>

This psalm is the deserted soul's case and cure. Whether it was penned
upon any particular occasion does not appear, but in general, I. David
sadly complains that God had long withdrawn from him and delayed to
relieve him ([Psa 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001.md), [Psa
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#002).md). II. He earnestly prays to God
to consider his case and comfort him ([Psa
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#003.md), [Psa
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#004).md). III. He assures himself of an
answer of peace, and therefore concludes the psalm with joy and triumph,
because he concludes his deliverance to be as good as wrought ([Psa
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#005.md), [Psa
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#006).md).

To the chief musician. A psalm of David.

[Psalms 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 13:1</span></span>

David, in affliction, is here pouring out his soul before God; his
address is short, but the method is very observable, and of use for
direction and encouragement.

I. His troubles extort complaints ([Psa
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001.md), [Psa
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#002).md); and the afflicted have liberty
to pour out their complaint before the Lord, Ps. 102 title. It is some
ease to a troubled spirit to give vent to its griefs, especially to give
vent to them at the throne of grace, where we are sure to find one who
is afflicted in the afflictions of his people and is troubled with the
feeling of their infirmities; thither we have boldness of access by
faith, and there we have parrēsia - freedom of speech. Observe here,

1\. What David complains of. (1.) God's unkindness; so he construed it,
and it was his infirmity. He thought God had forgotten him, had
forgotten his promises to him, his covenant with him, his former
lovingkindness which he had shown him and which he took to be an earnest
of further mercy, had forgotten that there was such a man in the world,
who needed and expected relief and succour from him. Thus Zion said, My
God has forgotten me ([Isa 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#014).md),
Israel said, My way is hidden from the Lord, [Isa
40:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#027.md). Not that any good man can doubt
the omniscience, goodness, and faithfulness of God; but it is a peevish
expression of prevailing fear, which yet, when it arises from a high
esteem and earnest desire of God's favour, though it be indecent and
culpable, shall be passed by and pardoned, for the second thought will
retract it and repent of it. God hid his face from him, so that he
wanted that inward comfort in God which he used to have, and herein was
a type of Christ upon the cross, crying out, My God, why hast thou
forsaken me? God sometimes hides his face from his own children, and
leaves them in the dark concerning their interest in him; and this they
lay to heart more than any outward trouble whatsoever. (2.) His own
uneasiness. \[1.\] He was racked with care, which filled his head: I
take counsel in my soul; "I am at a loss, and am inops consilii -
without a friend to advise with that I can put any confidence in, and
therefore am myself continually projecting what to do to help myself;
but none of my projects are likely to take effect, so that I am at my
wits' end, and in a continual agitation." Anxious cares are heavy
burdens with which good people often load themselves more than they
need. \[2.\] He was overwhelmed with sorrow, which filled his heart: I
have sorrow in my heart daily. He had a constant disposition to sorrow
and it preyed upon his spirits, not only in the night, when he was
silent and solitary, but by day too, when lighter griefs are diverted
and dissipated by conversation and business; nay, every day brought with
it fresh occasions of grief; the clouds returned after the rain. The
bread of sorrow is sometimes the saint's daily bread. Our Master himself
was a man of sorrows. (3.) His enemies' insolence, which added to his
grief. Saul his great enemy, and others under him, were exalted over
him, triumphed in his distress, pleased themselves with his grief, and
promised themselves a complete victory over him. This he complained of
as reflecting dishonour upon God, and his power and promise.

2\. How he expostulates with God hereupon: "How long shall it be thus?"
And, "Shall it be thus for ever?" Long afflictions try our patience and
often tire it. It is a common temptation, when trouble lasts long, to
think it will last always; despondency then turns into despair, and
those that have long been without joy begin, at last, to be without
hope. "Lord, tell me how long thou wilt hide thy face, and assure me
that it shall not be for ever, but that thou wilt return at length in
mercy to me, and then I shall the more easily bear my present troubles."

II\. His complaints stir up his prayers, [Psa
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#003.md), [Psa
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#004.md). We should never allow ourselves
to make any complaints but what are fit to be offered up to God and what
drive us to our knees. Observe here,

1\. What his petitions are: Consider my case, hear my complaints, and
enlighten my eyes, that is, (1.) "Strengthen my faith;" for faith is the
eye of the soul, with which it sees above, and sees through, the things
of sense. "Lord, enable me to look beyond my present troubles and to
foresee a happy issue of them." (2.) "Guide my way; enable me to look
about me, that I may avoid the snares which are laid for me." (3.)
"Refresh my soul with the joy of thy salvation." That which revives the
drooping spirits is said to enlighten the eyes, [Sa1
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#027.md); [Ezr
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#008.md). "Lord, scatter the cloud of
melancholy which darkens my eyes, and let my countenance be made
pleasant."

2\. What his pleas are. He mentions his relation to God and interest in
him (O Lord my God!) and insists upon the greatness of the peril, which
called for speedy relief and succour. If his eyes were not enlightened
quickly, (1.) He concludes that he must perish: "I shall sleep the sleep
of death; I cannot live under the weight of all this care and grief."
Nothing is more killing to a soul then the want of God's favour, nothing
more reviving than the return of it. (2.) That then his enemies would
triumph: "Lest my enemy say, So would I have it; lest Saul, lest Satan,
be gratified in my fall." It would gratify the pride of his enemy: He
will say, "I have prevailed, I have gotten the day, and been too hard
for him and his God." It would gratify the malice of his enemies: They
will rejoice when I am moved. And will it be for God's honour to suffer
them thus to trample upon all that is sacred both in heaven and earth?

III\. His prayers are soon turned into praises ([Psa
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#005.md), [Psa
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#006).md): But my heart shall rejoice and
I will sing to the Lord. What a surprising change is here in a few
lines! In the beginning of the psalm we have him drooping, trembling,
and ready to sink into melancholy and despair; but, in the close of it,
rejoicing in God, and elevated and enlarged in his praises. See the
power of faith, the power of prayer, and how good it is to draw near to
God. If we bring our cares and griefs to the throne of grace, and leave
them there, we may go away like Hannah, and our countenance will be no
more sad, [Sa1 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#018.md). And here observe
the method of his comfort. 1. God's mercy is the support of his faith.
"My case is bad enough, and I am ready to think it deplorable, till I
consider the infinite goodness of God; but, finding I have that to trust
to, I am comforted, though I have no merit of my own. In former
distresses I have trusted in the mercy of God, and I never found that it
failed me; his mercy has in due time relieved me and my confidence in it
has in the mean time supported me. Even in the depth of this distress,
when God hid his face from me, when without were fightings and within
were fears, yet I trusted in the mercy of God and that was as an anchor
in a storm, by the help of which, though I was tossed, I was not
overset." And still I do trust in thy mercy; so some read it. "I refer
myself to that, with an assurance that it will do well for me at last."
This he pleads with God, knowing what pleasure he takes in those that
hope in his mercy, [Psa 147:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#011.md). 2. His
faith in God's mercy filled his heart with joy in his salvation; for joy
and peace come by believing, [Rom
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#013.md). Believing, you rejoice, [Pe1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#008.md). Having put his trust in the mercy
of God, he is fully assured of salvation, and that his heart, which was
now daily grieving, should rejoice in that salvation. Though weeping
endure long, joy will return. 3. His joy in God's salvation would fill
his mouth with songs of praise ([Psa
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#006).md): "I will sing unto the Lord,
sing in remembrance of what he has done formerly; though I should never
recover the peace I have had, I will die blessing God that ever I had
it. He has dealt bountifully with me formerly, and he shall have the
glory of that, however he is pleased to deal with me now. I will sing in
hope of what he will do for me at last, being confident that all will
end well, will end everlastingly well." But he speaks of it as a thing
past (He has dealt bountifully with me), because by faith he had
received the earnest of the salvation and he was as confident of it as
if it had been done already.

In singing this psalm and praying it over, if we have not the same
complaints to make that David had, we must thank God that we have not,
dread and deprecate his withdrawings, sympathize with those that are
troubled in mind, and encourage ourselves in our most holy faith and
joy.
