### [1 Chronicles Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 3:0</span></span>

Of all the families of Israel none was so illustrious as the family of
David. That is the family which was mentioned in the foregoing chapter
([Ch1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#015).md). Here we have a full
account of it. I. David's sons ([Ch1
3:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001).md). II. His successors in the
throne as long as the kingdom continued ([Ch1
3:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#010).md). III. The remains of his
family in and after the captivity ([Ch1
3:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017).md). From this family, "as
concerning the flesh, Christ came."

[1 Chronicles 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 3:1</span></span>

We had an account of David's sons, [Sa2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#002.md), etc., and [Sa2
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#014.md), etc. 1. He had many sons; and no
doubt wrote as he thought, [Psa 127:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#005.md).
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of these arrows. 2. Some of
them were a grief to him, as Amnon, Absalom, and Adonijah; and we do not
read of any of them that imitated his piety or devotion except Solomon,
and he came far short of it. 3. One of them, which Bath-sheba bore to
him, he called Nathan, probably in honour of Nathan the prophet, who
reproved him for his sin in that matter and was instrumental to bring
him to repentance. It seems he loved him the better for it as long as he
lived. It is wisdom to esteem those our best friends that deal
faithfully with us. From this son of David our Lord Jesus descended, as
appears [Luk 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#031.md). 4. Here are two
Elishamas, and two Eliphelets, [Ch1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#006.md), [Ch1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#008.md). Probably the two former were
dead, and therefore David called two more by their names, which he would
not have done if there had been any ill omen in this practice as some
fancy. 5. David had many concubines; but their children are not named,
as not worthy of the honour ([Ch1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#009).md), the rather because the
concubines had dealt treacherously with David in the affair of Absalom.
6. Of all David's sons Solomon was chosen to succeed him, perhaps not
for any personal merits (his wisdom was God's gift), but so, Father,
because it seemed good unto thee.

[1 Chronicles 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 3:10</span></span>

David having nineteen sons, we may suppose them to have raised many
noble families in Israel whom we never hear of in the history. But the
scripture gives us an account only of the descendants of Solomon here,
and of Nathan, Lu. 3. The rest had the honour to be the sons of David;
but these only had the honour to be related to the Messiah. The sons of
Nathan were his fathers as man, the sons of Solomon his predecessors as
king. We have here, 1. The great and celebrated names by which the line
of David is drawn down to the captivity, the kings of Judah in a lineal
succession, the history of whom we have had at large in the two books of
Kings and shall meet with again in the second book of Chronicles. Seldom
has a crown gone in a direct line from father to son for seventeen
descents together, as here. This was the recompence of David's piety.
About the time of the captivity the lineal descent was interrupted, and
the crown went from one brother to another and from a nephew to an
uncle, which was a presage of the eclipsing of the glory of that house.
2. The less famous, and most of them very obscure, names, in which the
house of David subsisted after the captivity. The only famous man of
that house that we meet with at their return from captivity was
Zerubbabel, elsewhere called the son of Salathiel, but appearing here to
be his grandson ([Ch1 3:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017).md), which
is usual in scripture. Belshazzar is called Nebuchadnezzar's son, but
was his grandson. Salathiel is said to be the son of Jeconiah because
adopted by him, and because, as some think, he succeeded him in the
dignity to which he was restored by Evil-merodach. Otherwise Jeconiah
was written childless: he was the signet God plucked from his right hand
([Jer 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024).md), and in his room
Zerubbabel was placed, and therefore God saith to him ([Hag
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#023).md), I will make thee as a signet.
The posterity of Zerubbabel here bear not the same names that they do in
the genealogies (Mt. 1, or Lu. 3), but those no doubt were taken from
the then herald's office, the public registers which the priests kept of
all the families of Judah, especially that of David. The last person
named in this chapter is Anani, of whom bishop Patrick says that the
Targum adds these words, He is the king Messiah, who is to be revealed,
and some of the Jewish writers give this reason, because it is said
([Dan 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013).md), the son of man came gnim
gnanani - with the clouds of heaven. The reason indeed is very foreign
and far-fetched; but that learned man thinks it may be made use of as an
evidence that their minds were always full of the thoughts of the
Messiah and that they expected it would not be very long after the days
of Zerubbabel before the set time of his approach would come.
