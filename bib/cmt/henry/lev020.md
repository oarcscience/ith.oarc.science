### [Leviticus Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 20:0</span></span>

The laws which before were made are in this chapter repeated and
penalties annexed to them, that those who would not be deterred from sin
by the fear of God might be deterred from it by the fear of punishment.
If we will not avoid such and such practices because the law has made
them sin (and it is most acceptable when we go on that principle of
religion), surely we shall avoid them when the law has made them death,
from a principle of self-preservation. In this chapter we have, I. Many
particular crimes that are made capital. I. Giving their children to
Moloch ([Lev 20:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#001).md). 2. Consulting
witches ([Lev 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#006.md), [Lev
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#027).md). 3. Cursing parents ([Lev
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#009).md). 4. Adultery ([Lev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010).md). 5. Incest ([Lev
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#011.md), [Lev
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#012.md), [Lev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#014.md), [Lev
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#017.md), [Lev
20:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#019).md). 6. Unnatural lusts ([Lev
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#013.md), [Lev
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#015.md), [Lev
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#016.md), [Lev
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#018).md). II. General commands given to
be holy ([Lev 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#007.md), [Lev
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#008.md), [Lev
20:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#022).md).

[Leviticus 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 20:1</span></span>

Moses is here directed to say that again to the children of Israel which
he had in effect said before, [Lev
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002.md). We are sure it was no vain
repetition, but very necessary, that they might give the more earnest
heed to the things that were spoken, and might believe them to be of
great consequence, being so often inculcated. God speaketh once, yea,
twice, and what he orders to be said again we must be willing to hear
again, because for us it is safe, [Phi
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#001.md).

I. Three sins are in these verses threatened with death: -

1\. Parents abusing their children, by sacrificing them to Moloch, [Lev
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002.md), [Lev
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#003.md). There is the grossest absurdity
that can be in all the rites of idolatry, and they are all a great
reproach to men's reason; but none trampled upon all the honours of
human nature as this did, the burning of children in the fire to the
honour of a dunghill-god. It was a plain evidence that their gods were
devils, who desired and delighted in the misery and ruin of mankind, and
that the worshippers were worse than the beasts that perish, perfectly
stripped, not only of reason, but of natural affection. Abraham's
offering Isaac could not give countenance, much less could it give rise
to this barbarous practice, since, though that was commanded, it was
immediately countermanded. Yet such was the power of the god of this
world over the children of disobedience that this monstrous piece of
inhumanity was generally practised; and even the Israelites were in
danger of being drawn into it, which made it necessary that this severe
law should be made against it. It was not enough to tell them they might
spare their children (the fruit of their body should never be accepted
for the sin of their soul), but they must be told, (1.) That the
criminal himself should be put to death as a murderer: The people of the
land shall stone him with stones ([Lev
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002).md), which was looked upon as the
worst of capital punishments among the Jews. If the children were
sacrificed to the malice of the devil, the parents must be sacrificed to
the justice of God. And, if either the fact could not be proved or the
magistrates did not do their duty, God would take the work into his own
hands: I will cut him off, [Lev 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#003.md).
Note, Those that escape punishment from men, yet shall not escape the
righteous judgments of God; so wretchedly do those deceive themselves
that promise themselves impunity in sin. How can those escape against
whom God sets his face, that is, whom he frowns upon, meets as an enemy,
and fights against? The heinousness of the crime is here set forth to
justify the doom: it defiles the sanctuary, and profanes the holy name
of God, for the honour of both which he is jealous. Observe, The
malignity of the sin is laid upon that in it which was peculiar to
Israel. When the Gentiles sacrificed their children they were guilty of
murder and idolatry; but, if the Israelites did it, they incurred the
additional guilt of defiling the sanctuary (which they attended upon
even when they lay under this guilt, as if there might be an agreement
between the temple of God and idols), and of profaning the holy name of
God, by which they were called, as if he allowed his worshippers to do
such things, [Rom 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#023.md), [Rom
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#024). (2..md) That all his aiders and
abetters should be cut off likewise by the righteous hand of God. If his
neighbours concealed him, and would not come in as witnesses against
him, - if the magistrates connived at him, and would not pass sentence
upon him, rather pitying his folly than hating his impiety, - God
himself would reckon with them, [Lev
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#004.md), [Lev
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#005.md). Misprision of idolatry is a
crime cognizable in the court of heaven, and which shall not go
unpunished: I will set my face against that man (that magistrate, [Jer
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001).md) and against his family. Note,
\[1.\] The wickedness of the master of a family often brings ruin upon a
family; and he that should be the house-keeper proves the house-breaker.
\[2.\] If magistrates will not do justice upon offenders, God will do
justice upon them, because there is danger that many will go a whoring
after those who do but countenance sin by winking at it. And, if the
sins of leaders be leading sins, it is fit that their punishments should
be exemplary punishments.

2\. Children's abusing their parents, by cursing them, [Lev
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#009.md). If children should speak ill of
their parents, or wish ill to them, or carry it scornfully or spitefully
towards them, it was an iniquity to be punished by the judges, who were
employed as conservators both of God's honour and of the public peace,
which were both attacked by this unnatural insolence. See [Pro
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#017.md), The eye that mocks at his
father the ravens of the valley shall pick out, which intimates that
such wicked children were in a fair way to be not only hanged, but
hanged in chains. This law of Moses Christ quotes and confirms ([Mat
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#004).md), for it is as direct a breach of
the fifth commandment as wilful murder is of the sixth. The same law
which requires parents to be tender of their children requires children
to be respectful to their parents. He that despitefully uses his
parents, the instruments of his being, flies in the face of God himself,
the author of his being, who will not see the paternal dignity and
authority insulted and trampled upon.

3\. Persons abusing themselves by consulting such as have familiar
spirits, [Lev 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#006.md). By this, as much
as any thing, a man diminishes, disparages, and deceives himself, and so
abuses himself. What greater madness can there be than for a man to go
to a liar for information, and to an enemy for advice? Those do so who
turn after those that deal in the black art, and know the depths of
Satan. This is spiritual adultery as much as idolatry is, giving that
honour to the devil which is due to God only; and the jealous God will
give a bill of divorce to those that thus go a whoring from him, and
will cut them off, they having first cut themselves off from him.

II\. In the midst of these particular laws comes in that general charge,
[Lev 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#007.md), [Lev
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#008.md), where we have,

1\. The duties required; and they are two: - (1.) That in our
principles, affections, and aims, we be holy: Sanctify yourselves and be
you holy. We must cleanse ourselves from all the pollutions of sin,
consecrate ourselves to the service and honour of God, and conform
ourselves in every thing to his holy will and image: this is to sanctify
ourselves. (2.) That in all our actions, and in the whole course of our
conversation, we be obedient to the laws of God: You shall keep my
statutes. By this only can we make it to appear that we have sanctified
ourselves and are holy, even by our keeping God's commandments; the tree
is known by its fruit. Nor can we keep God's statutes, as we ought,
unless we first sanctify ourselves, and be holy. Make the tree good, and
the fruit will be good.

2\. The reasons to enforce these duties. (1.) "I am the Lord your God;
therefore be holy, that you may resemble him whose people you are, and
may be pleasing to him. Holiness becomes his house and household." (2.)
I am the Lord who sanctifieth you. God sanctified them by peculiar
privileges, laws, and favours, which distinguished them from all other
nations, and dignified them as a people set apart for God. He gave them
his word and ordinances to be means of their sanctification, and his
good Spirit to instruct them; therefore they must be holy, else they
received the grace of God herein in vain. Note, \[1.\] God's people are,
and must be, persons of distinction. God has distinguished them by his
holy covenant, and therefore they ought to distinguish themselves by
their holy conversation. \[2.\] God's sanctifying us is a good reason
why we should sanctify ourselves, that we may comply with the designs of
his grace, and not walk contrary to them. If it be the Lord that
sanctifies us, we may hope the work shall be done, though it be
difficult: the manner of expression is like that, [Co2
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#005.md), He that hath wrought us for the
self-same thing is God. And his grace is so far from superseding our
care and endeavour that it most strongly engages and encourages them.
Work out your salvation, for it is God that worketh in you.

[Leviticus 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 20:10</span></span>

Sins against the seventh commandment are here ordered to be severely
punished. These are sins which, of all others, fools are most apt to
make a mock at; but God would teach those the heinousness of the guilt
by the extremity of the punishment that would not otherwise be taught
it.

I. Lying with another man's wife was made a capital crime. The adulterer
and the adulteress that had joined in the sin must fall alike under the
sentence: they shall both be put to death, [Lev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010.md). Long before this, even in Job's
time, this was reputed a heinous crime and an iniquity to be punished by
the judges, [Job 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#011.md). It is a
presumptuous contempt of an ordinance of God, and a violation of his
covenant, [Pro 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#017.md). It is an
irreparable wrong to the injured husband, and debauches the mind and
conscience of both the offenders as much as any thing. It is a sin which
headstrong and unbridled lusts hurry men violently to, and therefore it
needs such a powerful restraint as this. It is a sin which defiles a
land and brings down God's judgments upon it, which disquiets families,
and tends to the ruin of all virtue and religion, and therefore is fit
to be animadverted upon by the conservators of the public peace: but see
[Joh 8:3-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#003.md).

II\. Incestuous connections, whether by marriage or not. 1. Some of them
were to be punished with death, as a man's lying with his father's wife,
[Lev 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#011.md). Reuben would have been put
to death for his crime ([Gen 35:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#022).md) if
this law had been then made. It was the sin of the incestuous
Corinthian, for which he was to be delivered unto Satan, [Co1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001.md), [Co1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005.md). A man's debauching his
daughter-in-law, or his mother-in-law, or his sister, was likewise to be
punished with death, [Lev 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#012.md), [Lev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#014.md), [Lev
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#017.md). 2. Others of them God would
punish with the curse of barrenness, as a man's defiling his aunt, or
his brother's wife ([Lev 20:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#019).md):
They shall die childless. Those that keep not within the divine rules of
marriage forfeit the blessings of marriage: They shall commit whoredom,
and shall not increase, [Hos 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#010.md). Nay
it is said, They shall bear their iniquity, that is, though they be not
immediately cut off by the hand either of God or man for this sin, yet
the guilt of it shall lie upon them, to be reckoned for another day, and
not be purged with sacrifice or offering.

III\. The unnatural lusts of sodomy and bestiality (sins not to be
mentioned without horror) were to be punished with death, as they are at
this day by our law, [Lev 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#013.md), [Lev
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#015.md), [Lev
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#016.md). Even the beast that was thus
abused was to be killed with the sinner, who was thereby openly put to
the greater shame: and the villany was thus represented as in the
highest degree execrable and abominable, all occasions of the
remembrance or mention of it being to be taken away. Even the
unseasonable use of the marriage, if presumptuous, and in contempt of
the law, would expose the offenders to the just judgment of God: they
shall be cut off, [Lev 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#018.md). For this
is the will of God, that every man should possess his vessel (and the
wife is called the weaker vessel) in sanctification and honour, as
becomes saints.

[Leviticus 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 20:22</span></span>

The last verse is a particular law, which comes in after the general
conclusion, as if omitted in its proper place: it is for the putting of
those to death that dealt with familiar spirits, [Lev
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#027.md). It would be an affront to God
and to his lively oracles, a scandal to the country, and a temptation to
ignorant bad people, to consult them, if such were known and suffered to
live among them. Those that are in league with the devil have in effect
made a covenant with death and an agreement with hell, and so shall
their doom be.

The rest of these verses repeat and inculcate what had been said before;
for to that unthinking forgetful people it was requisite that there
should be line upon line, and that general rules, with their reasons,
should be frequently insisted on, for the enforcement of particular
laws, and making them more effectual. Three things we are here reminded
of:-

I. Their dignity. 1. They had the Lord for their God, [Lev
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#024.md). They were his, his care, his
choice, his treasure, his jewels, his kingdom of priests ([Lev
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#026).md): That you should be mine. Happy
the people, and truly great, that are in such a case. 2. Their God was a
holy God ([Lev 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#026).md), infinitely
advanced above all others. His holiness is his glory, and it was their
honour to be related to him, while their neighbours were the infamous
worshippers of impure and filthy spirits. 3. The great God had separated
them from other people ([Lev 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#024).md),
and again, [Lev 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#026.md). Other nations
were the common; they were the enclosure, beautified and enriched with
peculiar privileges, and designed for peculiar honours; let them
therefore value themselves accordingly, preserve their honour, and not
lay it in the dust, by walking in the way of the heathen.

II\. Their duty; this is inferred from their dignity. God had done more
for them than for others, and therefore expected more from them than
from others. And what is it that the Lord their God requires, in
consideration of the great things done and designed? 1. You shall keep
all my statutes ([Lev 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#022).md); and
there was all the reason in the world that they should, for the statutes
were their honour, and obedience to them would be their lasting comfort.
2. You shall not walk in the manners of nations, [Lev
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#023.md). Being separated from them, they
must not associate with them, nor learn their ways. The manners of the
nations were bad enough in them, but would be much worse in God's
people. 3. You shall put a difference between clean and unclean, [Lev
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#025.md). This is holiness, to discern
between things that differ, not to live at large, as if we might say and
do any thing, but to speak and act with caution. 4. You shall not make
your souls abominable, [Lev 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#025.md). Our
constant care must be to preserve the honour, by preserving the purity,
of our own souls, and never to do any thing to make them abominable to
God and to our own consciences.

III\. Their danger. 1. They were going into an infected place ([Lev
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#024).md): You shall inherit their land,
a land flowing with milk and honey, which they would have the comfort of
if they kept their integrity; but, withal, it was a land full of idols,
idolatries, and superstitious usages, which they would be apt to fall in
love with, having brought from Egypt with them a strange disposition to
take that infection. 2. If they took the infection, it would be of
pernicious consequence to them. The Canaanites were to be expelled for
these very sins: They committed all these things, therefore I abhorred
them, [Lev 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#023.md). See what an evil
thing sin is; it provokes God to abhor his own creatures, whereas
otherwise he delights in the work of his hands. And, if the Israelites
trod in the steps of their impiety, they must expect that the land would
spue them out ([Lev 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#022).md), as he had
told them before, [Lev 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#028.md). If God
spared not the natural branches, but broke them off, neither would he
spare those who were grafted in, if they degenerated. Thus the rejection
of the Jews stands for a warning to all Christian churches to take heed
lest the kingdom of God be taken from them. Those that sin like others
must expect to smart like them; and their profession of relation to God
will be no security to them.
