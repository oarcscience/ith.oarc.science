### [Psalms Chapter 109](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 109:0</span></span>

Whether David penned this psalm when he was persecuted by Saul, or when
his son Absalom rebelled against him, or upon occasion of some other
trouble that was given him, is uncertain; and whether the particular
enemy he prays against was Saul, or Doeg, or Ahithophel, or some other
not mentioned in the story, we cannot determine; but it is certain that
in penning it he had an eye to Christ, his sufferings and his
persecutors, for that imprecation ([Psa
109:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#008).md) is applied to Judas, [Act
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#020.md). The rest of the prayers here
against his enemies were the expressions, not of passion, but of the
Spirit of prophecy. I. He lodges a complaint in the court of heaven of
the malice and base ingratitude of his enemies and with it an appeal to
the righteous God ([Psa 109:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#001).md). II.
He prays against his enemies, and devotes them to destruction ([Psa
109:6-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#006).md). III. He prays for himself,
that God would help and succour him in his low condition ([Psa
109:21-29](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#021).md). IV. He concludes with a
joyful expectation that God would appear for him ([Psa
109:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#030.md), [Psa
109:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#031).md). In singing this psalm we must
comfort ourselves with the believing foresight of the certain
destruction of all the enemies of Christ and his church, and the certain
salvation of all those that trust in God and keep close to him.

To the chief Musician. A psalm of David.

[Psalms 109:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 109:1</span></span>

It is the unspeakable comfort of all good people that, whoever is
against them, God is for them, and to him they may apply as to one that
is pleased to concern himself for them. Thus David here.

I. He refers himself to God's judgment ([Psa
109:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#001).md): "Hold not thy peace, but let
my sentence come forth from thy presence, [Psa
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#002.md). Delay not to give judgment upon
the appeal made to thee." God saw what his enemies did against him, but
seemed to connive at it, and to keep silence: "Lord," says he, "do not
always do so." The title he gives to God is observable: "O God of my
praise! the God in whom I glory, and not in any wisdom or strength of my
own, from whom I have every thing that is my praise, or the God whom I
have praised, and will praise, and hope to be for ever praising." He had
before called God the God of his mercy ([Psa
59:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#010).md), here he calls him the God of
his praise. Forasmuch as God is the God of our mercies we must make him
the God of our praises; if all is of him and from him, all must be to
him and for him.

II\. He complains of his enemies, showing that they were such as it was
fit for the righteous God to appear against. 1. They were very spiteful
and malicious: They are wicked; they delight in doing mischief ([Psa
109:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#002).md); their words are words of
hatred, [Psa 109:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#003.md). They had an
implacable enmity to a good man because of his goodness. "They open
their mouths against me to swallow me up, and fight against me to cut me
off if they could." 2. They were notorious liars; and lying comprehends
two of the seven things which the Lord hates. "They are deceitful in
their protestations and professions of kindness, while at the same time
they speak against me behind my back, with a lying tongue." They were
equally false in their flatteries and in their calumnies. 3. They were
both public and restless in their designs; "They compassed me about on
all sides, so that, which way soever I looked, I could see nothing but
what made against me." 4. They were unjust; their accusations of him,
and sentence against him, were all groundless: "They have fought against
me without a cause; I never gave them any provocation." Nay, which was
worst of all, 5. They were very ungrateful, and rewarded him evil for
good, [Psa 109:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#005.md). Many a kindness he
had done them, and was upon all occasions ready to do them, and yet he
could not work upon them to abate their malice against him, but, on the
contrary, they were the more exasperated because they could not provoke
him to give them some occasion against him ([Psa
109:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#004).md): For my love they are my
adversaries. The more he endeavoured to gratify them the more they hated
him. We may wonder that it is possible that any should be so wicked; and
yet, since there have been so many instances of it, we should not wonder
if any be so wicked against us.

III\. He resolves to keep close to his duty and take the comfort of
that: But I give myself unto prayer ([Psa
109:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#004).md), I prayer (so it is in the
original); "I am for prayer, I am a man of prayer, I love prayer, and
prize prayer, and practise prayer, and make a business of prayer, and am
in my element when I am at prayer." A good man is made up of prayer,
gives himself to prayer, as the apostles, [Act
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#004.md). When David's enemies falsely
accused him, and misrepresented him, he applied to God and by prayer
committed his cause to him. Though they were his adversaries for his
love, yet he continued to pray for them; if others are abusive and
injurious to us, yet let not us fail to do our duty to them, nor sin
against the Lord in ceasing to pray for them, [Sa1
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#023.md). Though they hated and
persecuted him for his religion, yet he kept close to it; they laughed
at him for his devotion, but they could not laugh him out of it. "Let
them say what they will, I give myself unto prayer." Now herein David
was a type of Christ, who was compassed about with words of hatred and
lying words, whose enemies not only persecuted him without cause, but
for his love and his good works ([Joh
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#032).md); and yet he gave himself to
prayer, to pray for them. Father, forgive them.

[Psalms 109:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 109:6</span></span>

David here fastens upon some one particular person that was worse than
the rest of his enemies, and the ringleader of them, and in a devout and
pious manner, not from a principle of malice and revenge, but in a holy
zeal for God and against sin and with an eye to the enemies of Christ,
particularly Judas who betrayed him, whose sin was greater than Pilate's
that condemned him ([Joh 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#011).md), he
imprecates and predicts his destruction, foresees and pronounces him
completely miserable, and such a one as our Saviour calls him, A son of
perdition. Calvin speaks of it as a detestable piece of sacrilege,
common in his time among Franciscan friars and other monks, that if any
one had malice against a neighbour he might hire some of them to curse
him every day, which he would do in the words of these verses; and
particularly he tells of a lady in France who, being at variance with
her own and only son, hired a parcel of friars to curse him in these
words. Greater impiety can scarcely be imagined than to vent a devilish
passion in the language of sacred writ, to kindle strife with coals
snatched from God's altar, and to call for fire from heaven with a
tongue set on fire of hell.

I. The imprecations here are very terrible - woe, and a thousand woes,
to that man against whom God says Amen to them; and they are all in full
force against the implacable enemies and persecutors of God's church and
people, that will not repent, to give him glory. It is here foretold
concerning this bad man,

1\. That he should be cast and sentenced as a criminal, with all the
dreadful pomp of a trial, conviction, and condemnation ([Psa
109:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#006.md), [Psa
109:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#007).md): Set thou a wicked man over
him, to be as cruel and oppressive to him as he has been to others; for
God often makes one wicked man a scourge to another, to spoil the
spoilers and to deal treacherously with those that have dealt
treacherously. Set the wicked one over him (so some), that is, Satan, as
it follows; and then it was fulfilled in Judas, into whom Satan entered,
to hurry him into sin first and then into despair. Set his own wicked
heart over him, set his own conscience against him; let that fly in his
face. Let Satan stand on his right hand, and be let loose against him to
deceive him, as he did Ahab to his destruction, and then to accuse him
and resist him, and then he is certainly cast, having no interest in
that advocate who alone can say, The Lord rebuke thee, Satan ([Zac
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001.md), [Zac
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#002).md); when he shall be judged at men's
bar let not his usual arts to evade justice do him any service, but let
his sin find him out and let him be condemned; nor shall he escape
before God's tribunal, but be condemned there when the day of
inquisition and recompence shall come. Let his prayer become sin, as the
clamours of a condemned malefactor not only find no acceptance, but are
looked upon as an affront to the court. The prayers of the wicked now
become sin, because soured with the leaven of hypocrisy and malice; and
so they will in the great day, because then it will be too late to cry,
Lord, Lord, open to us. Let every thing be turned against him and
improved to his disadvantage, even his prayers.

2\. That, being condemned, he should be executed as a most notorious
malefactor. (1.) That he should lose his life, and the number of his
months be cut off in the midst, by the sword of justice: Let his days be
few, or shortened, as a condemned criminal has but a few days to live
([Psa 109:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#008).md); such bloody and
deceitful men shall not live out half their days. (2.) That consequently
all his places should be disposed of to others, and they should enjoy
his preferments and employments: Let another take his office. This Peter
applies to the filling up of Judas's place in the truly sacred college
of the apostles, by the choice of Matthias, [Act
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#020.md). Those that mismanage their
trusts will justly have their office taken from them and given to those
that will approve themselves faithful. (3.) That his family should be
beheaded and beggared, that his wife should be made a widow and his
children fatherless, by his untimely death, [Psa
109:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#009.md). Wicked men, by their wicked
courses, bring ruin upon their wives and children, whom they ought to
take care of and provide for. Yet his children, if, when they lost their
father, they had a competency to live upon, might still subsist in
comfort; but they shall be vagabonds and shall beg; they shall not have
a house of their own to live in, nor any certain dwelling-place, nor
know where to have a meal's-meat, but shall creep out of their desolate
places with fear and trembling, like beasts out of their dens, to seek
their bread ([Psa 109:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#010).md), because
they are conscious to themselves that all mankind have reason to hate
them for their father's sake. (4.) That his estate should be ruined, as
the estates of malefactors are confiscated ([Psa
109:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#011).md): Let the extortioner, the
officer, seize all that he has and let the stranger, who was nothing
akin to his estate, spoil his labour, either for his crimes or for his
debts, [Job 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#004.md), [Job
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#005). (5..md) That his posterity should be
miserable. Fatherless children, though they have nothing of their own,
yet sometimes are well provided for by the kindness of those whom God
inclines to pity them; but this wicked man having never shown mercy
there shall be none to extend mercy to him, by favouring his fatherless
children when he is gone, [Psa 109:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#012.md).
The children of wicked parents often fare the worse for their parents'
wickedness in this way that the bowels of men's compassion are shut up
from them, which yet ought not to be, for why should children suffer for
that which was not their fault, but their infelicity? (6.) That his
memory should be infamous, and buried in oblivion and disgrace ([Psa
109:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#013).md): Let his posterity be cut off;
let his end be to destruction (so Dr. Hammond); and in the next
generation let their name be blotted out, or remembered with contempt
and indignation, and ([Psa 109:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#015).md) let
an indelible mark of disgrace be left upon it. See here what hurries
some to shameful deaths, and brings the families and estates of others
to ruin, makes them and their despicable and odious, and entails
poverty, and shame, and misery, upon their posterity; it is sin, that
mischievous destructive thing. The learned Dr. Hammond applies this to
the final dispersion and desolation of the Jewish nation for their
crucifying Christ; their princes and people were cut off, their country
was laid waste, and their posterity were made fugitives and vagabonds.

II\. The ground of these imprecations bespeaks them very just, though
they sound very severe. 1. To justify the imprecations of vengeance upon
the sinner's posterity, the sin of his ancestors is here brought into
the account ([Psa 109:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#014.md), [Psa
109:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#015).md), the iniquity of his fathers
and the sin of his mother. These God often visits even upon the
children's children, and is not unrighteous therein: when wickedness has
long run in the blood justly does the curse run along with it. Thus all
the innocent blood that had been shed upon the earth, from that of
righteous Abel, was required from that persecuting generation, who, by
putting Christ to death, filled up the measure of their fathers, and
left as long a train of vengeance to follow them as the train of guilt
was that went before them, which they themselves agreed to by saying,
His blood be upon us and on our children. 2. To justify the imprecations
of vengeance upon the sinner himself, his own sin is here charged upon
him, which called aloud for it. (1.) He had loved cruelty, and therefore
give him blood to drink ([Psa 109:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#016).md):
He remembered not to show mercy, remembered not those considerations
which should have induced him to show mercy, remembered not the objects
of compassion that had been presented to him, but persecuted the poor,
whom he should have protected and relieved, and slew the broken in
heart, whom he should have comforted and healed. Here is a barbarous man
indeed, not it to live. (2.) He had loved cursing, and therefore let the
curse come upon his head, [Psa
109:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#017.md). Those that were out of the
reach of his cruelty he let fly at with his curses, which were impotent
and ridiculous; but they shall return upon him. He delighted not in
blessing; he took no pleasure in wishing well to others, nor in seeing
others do well; he would give nobody a good word or a good wish, much
less would he do any body a good turn; and so let all good be far from
him. He clothed himself with cursing; he was proud of it as an ornament
that he could frighten all about him with the curses he was liberal of;
he confided in it as armour, which would secure him from the insults of
those he feared. And let him have enough of it. Was he fond of cursing?
Let God's curse come into his bowels like water and swell him as with a
dropsy, and let it soak like oil into his bones. The word of the curse
is quick and powerful, and divides between the joints and the marrow; it
works powerfully and effectually; it fastens on the soul; it is a
piercing thing, and there is no antidote against it. Let is compass him
on every side as a garment, [Psa
109:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#019.md). Let God's cursing him be his
shame, as his cursing his neighbour was his pride; let it cleave to him
as a girdle, and let him never be able to get clear of it. Let it be to
him like the waters of jealousy, which caused the belly to swell and the
thigh to rot. This points at the utter ruin of Judas, and the spiritual
judgments which fell on the Jews for crucifying Christ. The psalmist
concludes his imprecations with a terrible Amen, which signifies not
only, "I wish it may be so," but "I know it shall be so." Let this be
the reward of my adversaries from the Lord, [Psa
109:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#020.md). And this will be the reward of
all the adversaries of the Lord Jesus; his enemies that will not have
him to reign over them shall be brought forth and slain before him. And
he will one day recompense tribulation to those that trouble his people.

[Psalms 109:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 109:21</span></span>

David, having denounced God's wrath against his enemies, here takes
God's comforts to himself, but in a very humble manner, and without
boasting.

I. He pours out his complaint before God concerning the low condition he
was in, which, probably, gave advantage to his enemies to insult over
him: "I am poor and needy, and therefore a proper object of pity, and
one that needs and craves thy help." 1. He was troubled in mind ([Psa
109:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#022).md): My heart is wounded within
me, not only broken with outward troubles, which sometimes prostrate and
sink the spirits, but wounded with a sense of guilt; and a wounded
spirit who can bear? who can heal? 2. He apprehended himself drawing
near to his end: I am gone like the shadow when it declines, as good as
gone already. Man's life, at best, is like a shadow; sometimes it is
like the evening shadow, the presage of night approaching, like the
shadow when it declines. 3. He was unsettled, tossed up and down like
the locust, his mind fluctuating and unsteady, still putting him upon
new counsels, his outward condition far from any fixation, but still
upon the remove, hunted like a partridge on the mountains. 4. His body
was wasted, and almost worn away ([Psa
109:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#024).md): My knees are weak through
fasting, either forced fasting (for want of food when he was persecuted,
or for want of appetite when he was sick) or voluntary fasting, when he
chastened his soul either for sin or affliction, his own or other's,
[Psa 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#013.md); [Psa
69:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#010.md). "My flesh fails of fatness;
that is, it has lost the fatness it had, so that I have become a
skeleton, nothing but skin and bones." But it is better to have this
leanness in the body, while the soul prospers and is in health, than,
like Israel, to have leanness sent into the soul, while the body is
feasted. 5. He was ridiculed and reproached by his enemies ([Psa
109:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#025).md); his devotions and his
afflictions they made the matter of their laughter, and, upon both those
accounts, God's people have been exceedingly filled with the scorning of
those that were at ease. In all this David was a type of Christ, who in
his humiliation was thus wounded, thus weakened, thus reproached; he was
also a type of the church, which is often afflicted, tossed with
tempests, and not comforted.

II\. He prays for mercy for himself. In general ([Psa
109:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#021).md): "Do thou for me, O God the
Lord! appear for me, act for me." If God be for us, he will do for us,
will do more abundantly for us than we are able either to ask or think.
He does not prescribe to God what he should do for him, but refers
himself to his wisdom: "Lord, do for me what seems good in thy eyes. Do
that which thou knowest will be for me, really for me, in the issue for
me, though for the present it may seem to make against me." More
particularly, he prays ([Psa 109:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#026).md):
"Help me, O Lord my God! O save me! Help me under my trouble, save me
out of my trouble; save me from sin, help me to do my duty." He prays
([Psa 109:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#028).md), Though they curse,
bless thou. Here (1.) He despises the causeless curses of his enemies:
Let them curse. He said of Shimei, So let him curse. They can but show
their malice; they can do him no more mischief than the bird by
wandering or the swallow by flying, [Pro
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#002.md). He values the blessing of God as
sufficient to counterbalance their curses: Bless thou, and then it is no
matter though they curse. If God bless us, we need not care who curses
us; for how can they curse those whom God has not cursed, nay, whom he
has blessed? [Num 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#008.md). Men's curses
are impotent; God's blessings are omnipotent; and those whom we unjustly
curse may in faith expect and pray for God's blessing, his special
blessing. When the Pharisees cast out the poor man for his confessing
Christ, Christ found him, [Joh 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#035.md).
When men without cause say all the ill they can of us, and wish all the
ills they can to us, we may with comfort lift up our heart to God in
this petition: Let them curse, but bless thou. He prays ([Psa
109:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#028).md), Let thy servant rejoice.
Those that know how to value God's blessing, let them but be sure of it,
and they will be glad of it.

III\. He prays that his enemies might be ashamed ([Psa
109:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#028).md), clothed with shame ([Psa
109:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#029).md), that they might cover
themselves with their own confusion, that they might be left to
themselves, to do that which would expose them and manifest their folly
before all men, or rather that they might be disappointed in their
designs and enterprises against David, and thereby might be filled with
shame, as the adversaries of the Jews were, [Neh
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#016.md). Nay, in this he prays that they
might be brought to repentance, which is the chief thing we should beg
of God for our enemies. Sinners indeed bring shame upon themselves, but
they are true penitents that take shame to themselves and cover
themselves with their own confusion.

IV\. He pleads God's glory, the honour of his name: - Do for me, for thy
name's sake ([Psa 109:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#021).md), especially
the honour of his goodness, by which he has proclaimed his name:
"Deliver me, because thy mercy is good; it is what thou thyself dost
delight in, and it is what I do depend upon. Save me, not according to
my merit, for I have none to pretend to, but according to thy mercy; let
that be the fountain, the reason, the measure, of my salvation."

Lastly, He concludes the psalm with joy, the joy of faith, joy in
assurance that his present conflicts would end in triumphs. 1. He
promises God that he will praise him ([Psa
109:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#030).md): "I will greatly praise the
Lord, not only with my heart, but with my mouth; I will praise him, not
in secret only, but among the multitude." 2. He promises himself that he
shall have cause to praise God ([Psa
109:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#031).md): He shall stand at the right
hand of the poor, night to him, a present help; he shall stand at his
right hand as his patron and advocate to plead his cause against his
accusers and to bring him off, to save him from those that condemn his
soul and would execute their sentence if they could. God was David's
protector in his sufferings, and was present also with the Lord Jesus in
his, stood at his right hand, so that he was not moved ([Psa
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008).md), saved his soul from those that
pretended to be the judges of it, and received it into his own hands.
Let all those that suffer according to the will of God commit the
keeping of their souls to him.
