### [2 Chronicles Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 32:0</span></span>

This chapter continues and concludes the history of the reign of
Hezekiah. I. The descent which Sennacherib made upon him, and the care
he took to fortify himself, his city, and the minds of his people,
against that enemy ([Ch2 32:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001).md). II.
The insolent blasphemous letters and messages which Sennacherib sent him
([Ch2 32:9-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#009).md). III. The real answer
God gave to Sennacherib's blasphemies, and to Hezekiah's prayers, in the
total rout of the Assyrian army, to the shame of Sennacherib and the
honour of Hezekiah ([Ch2 32:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#020).md).
IV. Hezekiah's sickness and his recovery from that, his sin and his
recovery from that, with the honours that attended him living and dead
([Ch2 32:24-33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#024).md).

[2 Chronicles 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 32:1</span></span>

Here is, I. The formidable design of Sennacherib against Hezekiah's
kingdom, and the vigorous attempt he made upon it. This Sennacherib was
now, as Nebuchadnezzar was afterwards, the terror and scourge and great
oppressor of that part of the world. He aimed to raise a boundless
monarchy for himself upon the ruins of all his neighbours. His
predecessor Shalmaneser had lately made himself master of the kingdom of
Israel, and carried the ten tribes captives. Sennacherib thought, in
like manner, to win Judah for himself. Pride and ambition put men upon
grasping at universal dominion. It is observable that, just about this
time, Rome, a city which afterwards came to reign more than any other
had done over the kings of the earth, was built by Romulus. Sennacherib
invaded Judah immediately after the reformation of it and the
re-establishment of religion in it: After these things he entered into
Judah, [Ch2 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001.md). 1. It was well
ordered by the divine Providence that he did not give them this
disturbance before the reformation was finished and established, as it
might then have put a stop to it. 2. Perhaps he intended to chastise
Hezekiah for destroying that idolatry to which he himself was devoted.
He looked upon Hezekiah as profane in what he had done, and as having
thrown himself out of the divine protection. He accordingly considered
him as one who might easily be made a prey of. 3. God ordered it at this
time that he might have an opportunity of showing himself strong on the
behalf of this returning reforming people. He brought this trouble upon
them that he might have the honour, and might put on them the honour, of
their deliverance. After these things, and the establishment thereof,
one would have expected to hear of nothing but perfect peace, and that
none durst meddle with a people thus qualified for the divine favour;
yet the next news we hear is that a threatening destroying army enters
the country, and is ready to lay all waste. We may be in the way of our
duty and yet meet with trouble and danger. God orders it so for the
trial of our confidence in him and the manifestation of his care
concerning us. The little opposition which Sennacherib met with in
entering Judah induced him to imagine that all was his own. He thought
to win all the fenced cities ([Ch2
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001).md), and purposed to fight against
Jerusalem, [Ch2 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#002.md). See [Kg2
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#007.md), [Kg2
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013.md).

II\. The preparation which Hezekiah prudently made against this storm
that threatened him: He took counsel with his princes what he should do,
what measures he should take, [Ch2
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#003.md). With their advice he provided,
1. That the country should give him a cold reception, for he took care
that he should find no water in it (and then his army must perish for
thirst), or at least that there should be a scarcity of water, by which
his army would be weakened and unfitted for service. A powerful army, if
it want water but a few days, will be but a heap of dry dust. All hands
were set immediately to work to stop up the fountains, and the brook
that ran through the midst of the land, turning that (it is probable)
into the city by pipes under-ground. Such as this is the policy commonly
practised now-a-days of destroying the forage before an invading army.
2. That the city should give him a warm reception. In order to this he
repaired the wall, raised towers, and made darts (or, as it is in the
margin, swords or weapons) and shields in abundance ([Ch2
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#005).md), and appointed captains, [Ch2
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#006.md). Note, Those that trust God with
their safety must yet use proper means for their safety, otherwise they
tempt him, and do not trust him. God will provide, but so must we also.

III\. The encouragement which he gave to his people to depend upon God
in this distress. He gathered them together in a broad open street, and
spoke comfortably to them, [Ch2 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#006.md).
He was himself undaunted, being confident the invasion would issue well.
He was not like his father, who had much guilt to terrify him and no
faith to encourage him, so that, in a time of public danger, his heart
was moved, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind, and then no
marvel that the heart of his people was so too, [Isa
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#002.md). With what he said he put life
into his people, his captains especially, and spoke to their heart, as
the word is. 1. He endeavoured to keep down their fears: "Be strong and
courageous; do not think of surrendering the city or capitulating, but
resolve to hold it out to the last man; do not think of losing the city,
nor of falling into the enemy's hand; there is no danger. Let the
soldiers be bold and brave, make good their posts, stand to their arms,
and fight manfully, and let the citizens encourage them to do so: Be not
afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria." The prophet had thus
encouraged them from God ([Isa 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024).md):
Be not afraid of the Assyrians; and here the king from him. Now it was
that the sinners in Zion were afraid ([Isa
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014).md), but the righteous dwelt on
high ([Isa 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#015.md), [Isa
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#016).md) and meditated on terror so as
to conquer it. See [Isa 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#018.md), which
refers to what is recorded here. 2. He endeavoured to keep up their
faith, in order to the silencing and suppressing of their fears.
"Sennacherib has a multitude with him, and yet there are more with us
than with him; for we have God with us, and how many do you reckon him
for? With our enemy is an arm of flesh, which he trusts to; but with us
is the Lord, whose power is irresistible, our God, whose promise is
inviolable, a God in covenant with us, to help us, and to fight our
battles, not only to help us to fight them, but to fight them for us if
he please:" and so he did here. Note, A believing confidence in God will
raise us above the prevailing fear of man. He that feareth the fury of
the oppressor forgetteth the Lord his Maker, [Isa
51:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#012.md), [Isa
51:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#013.md). It is probable that Hezekiah
said more to this purport, and that the people rested themselves upon
what he said, not merely upon his word, but on the things he said
concerning the presence of God with them and his power to relieve them,
the belief of which made them easy. Let the good subjects and soldiers
of Jesus Christ rest thus upon his word, and boldly say, Since God is
for us, who can be against us?

[2 Chronicles 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 32:9</span></span>

This story of the rage and blasphemy of Sennacherib, Hezekiah's prayer,
and the deliverance of Jerusalem by the destruction of the Assyrian
army, we had more at large in the book of Kings, 2 Kings 18 and 19. It
is contracted here, yet large enough to show these three things: -

I. The impiety and malice of the church's enemies. Sennacherib has his
hands full in besieging Lachish ([Ch2
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#009).md), but hears that Hezekiah is
fortifying Jerusalem and encouraging his people to stand it out; and
therefore, before he come in person to besiege it, he sends messengers
to make speeches, and he himself writes letters to frighten Hezekiah and
his people into a surrender of the city. See, 1. His great malice
against the king of Judah, in endeavouring to withdraw his subjects from
their allegiance to him. He did not treat with Hezekiah as a man of
honour would have done, nor propose fair terms to him, but used mean and
base artifices, unbecoming a crowned head, to terrify the common people
and persuade them to desert him. he represented Hezekiah as one who
designed to deceive his subjects into their ruin and betray them to
famine and thirst ([Ch2 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#011).md), as one
who had done them great wrong and exposed them already to the divine
displeasure by taking away the high places and altars ([Ch2
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#012).md), and who, against the common
interest of his people, held out against a force that would certainly be
their ruin, [Ch2 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#015.md). 2. His great
impiety against the God of Israel, the God of Jerusalem he is called
([Ch2 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#019).md), because that was the
place he had chosen to put his name there, and because that was the
place which was now threatened by the enemy and which the divine
Providence had under its special protection. This proud blasphemer
compared the great Jehovah, the Maker of heaven and earth, with the
dunghill gods of the nations, the work of men's hands, and thought him
no more able to deliver his worshippers than they were to deliver theirs
([Ch2 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#019).md), as if an infinite and
eternal Spirit had no more wisdom and power than a stone or the stock of
a tree. He boasted of his triumphs over the gods of the nations, that
they could none of them protect their people ([Ch2
32:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#013).md), and thence inferred not
only, How shall your God deliver you? ([Ch2
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#014).md), but, as if he were inferior to
them all, How much less shall your God deliver you? as if he were less
able to help than any of them. Thus did they rail, rail in writing
(which, being more deliberate, is so much the worse), on the Lord God of
Israel, as if he were a cipher and an empty name, like all the rest,
[Ch2 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#017.md). Sennacherib, in the
instructions he gave, said more than enough; but, as if his blasphemies
had been too little, his servants, who learned insolence from their
master, spoke yet more than he bade them against the Lord God and his
servant Hezekiah, [Ch2 32:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#016.md). And God
resents what is said against his servants, and will reckon for it, as
well as what is said against himself. All this was intended to frighten
the people from their hope in God, which David's enemies sought to take
him off from ([Psa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001.md); [Psa
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#010).md), saying, There is no help for
him in God, [Psa 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002.md); [Psa
71:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#011.md). Thus they hoped to take the
city by weakening the hands of those that should defend it. Satan, in
his temptations, aims to destroy our faith in God's all-sufficiency,
knowing that he shall gain his point if he can do that; as we keep our
ground if our faith fail not, [Luk
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032.md).

II\. The duty as well as the interest of the church's friends, and that
is in the day of distress to pray and cry to Heaven. So Hezekiah did,
and the prophet Isaiah, [Ch2 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#020.md). It
was a happy time when the king and the prophet joined thus in prayer. Is
any troubled? Is any terrified? Let him pray. So we engage God for us;
so we encourage ourselves in him. Praying to God is here called crying
to Heaven, because we are, in prayer, to eye him as our Father in
heaven, whence he beholds the children of men, and where he has prepared
his throne.

III\. The power and goodness of the church's God. He is able both to
control his enemies, be they ever so high, and to relieve his friends,
be they ever so low.

1\. As the blasphemies of his enemies engage him against them ([Deu
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#027).md), so the prayers of his people
engage him for them. They did so here. (1.) The army of the Assyrians
was cut off by the sword of an angel, which triumphed particularly in
the slaughter of the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains,
who defied the sword of any man. God delights to abase the proud and
secure. The Targum says, The Word of the Lord (the eternal Word) sent
Gabriel to do this execution, and that it was done with lightning, and
in the passover night: that was the night in which the angel destroyed
the first-born of Egypt. But that was not all. (2.) The king of the
Assyrians, having received this disgrace, was cut off by the sword of
his own sons. Those that came forth of his own bowels slew him, [Ch2
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#021.md). Thus was he mortified first,
and then murdered - shamed first, and then slain. Evil pursues sinners;
and, when they escape one mischief, they run upon another unseen.

2\. By this work of wonder, (1.) God was glorified, as the protector of
his people. Thus he saved Jerusalem, not only from the hand of
Sennacherib, but from the hand of all others, [Ch2
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#022.md); for such a deliverance as this
was an earnest of much mercy in store; and he guided them, that is, he
guarded them, on every side. God defends his people by directing them,
shows them what they should do, and so saves them from what is designed
or done against them. For this many brought gifts unto the Lord, when
they saw the great power of God in the defence of his people. Strangers
were thereby induced to supplicate his favour and enemies to deprecate
his wrath, and both brought gifts to his temple, in token of their care
and desire. (2.) Hezekiah was magnified as the favourite and particular
care of Heaven. Many brought presents to him ([Ch2
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#022.md), [Ch2
32:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#023).md), in token of the honour they
had for him, and to make an interest in him. By the favour of God
enemies are lost and friends gained.

[2 Chronicles 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch2 32:24</span></span>

Here we conclude the story of Hezekiah with an account of three things
concerning him: -

I. His sickness and his recovery from it, [Ch2
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#024.md). The account of his sickness is
but briefly mentioned here; we had a large narrative of it, 2 Kings 20.
His disease seemed likely to be mortal. In the extremity of it he
prayed. God answered him, and gave him a sign that he should recover,
the going back of the sun ten degrees.

II\. His sin and his repentance for it, which were also more largely
related, [Kg2 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#012.md), etc. Yet several
things are here observed concerning his sin which we had not there. 1.
The occasion of it was the king of Babylon's sending an honourable
embassy to him to congratulate him on his recovery. But here it is added
that they came to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land ([Ch2
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031).md), either the destruction of the
Assyrian army or the going back of the sun. The Assyrians were their
enemies; they came to enquire concerning their fall, that they might
triumph in it. The sun was their god; they came to enquire concerning
the favour he had shown to Hezekiah, that they might honour him whom
their god honoured, [Ch2 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031.md). These
miracles were wrought to alarm and awaken a stupid careless world, and
turn them from dumb and lame idols to the living God; and men were
startled by them, but not converted till a greater wonder was done in
that land, in the appearing of Jesus Christ, [Mat
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001.md), [Mat
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002.md). 2. God left him to himself in it,
to try him, [Ch2 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031.md). God, by the
power of his almighty grace, could have prevented the sin; but he
permitted it for wise and holy ends, that, by this trial and his
weakness in it, he might know, that is, it might be known (a usual
Hebraism), what was in his heart, that he was not so perfect in grace as
he thought he was, but had his follies and infirmities as other men. God
left him to himself to be proud of his wealth, to keep him from being
proud of his holiness. It is good for us to know ourselves, and our own
weakness and sinfulness, that we may not be conceited or self-confident,
but may always think meanly of ourselves and live in a dependence upon
divine grace. We know not the corruption of our own hearts, nor what we
shall do if God leave us to ourselves. Lord, lead us not into
temptation. 3. His sin was the his heart was lifted up, [Ch2
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#025.md). He was proud of the honour God
had put upon him in so many instances, the honour his neighbours did him
in bringing him presents, and now that the king of Babylon should send
an embassy to him to caress and court him: this exalted him above
measure. When Hezekiah had destroyed other idolatries he began to
idolize himself. O what need have great men, and good men, and useful
men, to study their own infirmities and follies, and their obligations
to free grace, that they may never think highly of themselves, and to
beg earnestly of God that he will hide pride from them and always keep
them humble! 4. The aggravation of his sin was the he made so bad a
return to God for his favours to him, making even those favours the food
and fuel of his pride ([Ch2 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#025).md): He
rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him. Note, It is
justly expected that those who have received mercy from God should study
to make some suitable returns for the mercies they have received; and,
if they do not, their ingratitude will certainly be charged upon them.
Though we cannot render an equivalent, or the payment of a debt, we must
render the acknowledgment of a favour. What shall I render that may be
so accepted? [Psa 116:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#012.md). 5. The
divine displeasure he was under for this sin; though it was but a
heart-sin, and the overt-act seemed not only innocent but civil (the
showing of his treasures to a friend), yet wrath came upon him and his
kingdom for it, [Ch2 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#025.md). Note,
Pride is a sin that God hates as much as any, and particularly in his
own people. Those that exalt themselves must expect to be abased, and
put under humbling providences. Wrath came on David for his pride in
numbering the people. 6. His repentance for this sin: He humbled himself
for the pride of his heart. Note, (1.) Though God may, for wise and holy
ends, suffer his people to fall into sin, yet he will not suffer them to
lie still in it; they shall not be utterly cast down. (2.) Heart-sins
are to be repented of, though they go no further. (3.) Self-humiliation
is a necessary branch of repentance. (4.) Pride of heart, by which we
have lifted up ourselves, is a sin for which we ought in a special
manner to humble ourselves. (5.) People ought to mourn for the sins of
their rulers. The inhabitants of Jerusalem humbled themselves with
Hezekiah, because they either knew that they also had been guilty of the
same sin, or at least feared that they might share in the punishment.
When David, in his pride, numbered the people, they all smarted for his
sin. 7. The reprieve granted thereupon. The wrath came not in his days.
While he lived the country had peace and truth prevailed; so much does
repentance avail to put by, or at least to put off, the tokens of God's
anger.

III\. Here is the honour done to Hezekiah, 1. By the providence of God
while he lived. He had exceeding much riches and honour ([Ch2
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#027).md), replenished his stores,
victualled his campus, fortified his city, and did all he wished to do;
for God had given him very much substance, [Ch2
32:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#029.md). Among his great performances,
his turning the water-course of Gihon is mentioned ([Ch2
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#030).md), which was done upon occasion
of Sennacherib's invasion, [Ch2 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#003.md),
[Ch2 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#004.md). The water had come into
that which is called the old pool ([Isa
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#011).md) and the upper pool ([Isa
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003).md); but he gathered the waters into
a new place, for the greater convenience of the city, called the lower
pool, [Isa 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#009.md). And, in general, he
prospered in all his works, for they were good works. 2. By the respect
paid to his memory when he was dead. (1.) The prophet Isaiah wrote his
life and reign ([Ch2 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#032).md), his acts
and his goodness or piety, or which it is part of the honour to be
recorded and remembered, for examples to others. (2.) The people did him
honour at his death ([Ch2 32:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#033).md),
buried him in the chief of the sepulchres, made as great a burning for
him as for Asa, or, which is a much greater honour, made great
lamentation for him, as for Josiah. See how the honour of serious
godliness is manifested in the consciences of men. Though it is to be
feared that the generality of the people did not heartily comply with
the reforming kings, yet they could not but praise their endeavours for
reformation, and the memory of those kings was blessed among them. It is
a debt we owe to those who have been eminently useful in their day to do
them honour at their death, when they are out of the reach of flattery
and we have seen the end of their conversation. The due payment of this
debt will be an encouragement to others to do likewise.
