### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 24:0</span></span>

Things are here ripening for, and hastening towards, the utter
destruction of Jerusalem. We left Jehoiakim on the throne, placed there
by the king of Egypt: now here we have, I. The troubles of his reign,
how he was brought into subjection by the king of Babylon, and severely
chastised for attempting to shake off the yoke ([Kg2
24:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001).md), and how Egypt also was
conquered by Nebuchadnezzar ([Kg2
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007).md). II. The desolations of his
son's reign, which continued but three months; and then he and all his
great men, being forced to surrender at discretion, were carried
captives to Babylon ([Kg2 24:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008).md).
III. The preparatives of the next reign (which was the last of all) for
the utter ruin of Jerusalem, which the next chapter will give us an
account of ([Kg2 24:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#017).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 24:1</span></span>

We have here the first mention of a name which makes a great figure both
in the histories and in the prophecies of the Old Testament; it is that
of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon ([Kg2
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001).md), that head of gold. He was a
potent prince, and one that was the terror of the mighty in the land of
the living; and yet his name would not have been known in sacred writ if
he had not been employed in the destruction of Jerusalem and the
captivity of the Jews.

I. He made Jehoiakim his tributary and kept him in subjection three
years, [Kg2 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001.md). Nebuchadnezzar began
his reign in the fourth year of Jehoiakim. In his eighth year he made
him his prisoner, but restored him upon his promise of faithfulness to
him. That promise he kept about three years, but then rebelled, probably
in hopes of assistance from the king of Egypt. If Jehoiakim had served
his God as he should have done, he would not have been servant to the
king of Babylon; but God would thus make him know the difference between
his service and the service of the kings of the countries, [Ch2
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#008.md). If he had been content with his
servitude, and true to his word, his condition would have been no worse;
but, rebelling against the king of Babylon, he plunged himself into more
trouble.

II\. When he rebelled Nebuchadnezzar sent his forces against him to
destroy his country, bands of Chaldeans, Syrians, Moabites, Ammonites,
who were all now in the service and pay of the king of Babylon ([Kg2
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002).md), and withal retained, and now
showed, their ancient enmity to the Israel of God. Yet no mention is
here made of their commission from the king of Babylon, but only of that
from the King of kings: The Lord sent against him all these bands; and
again ([Kg2 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#003).md), Surely at the
commandment of the Lord came this upon Judah, else the commandment of
Nebuchadnezzar could not have brought it. Many are serving God's
purposes who are not aware of it. Two things God intended in suffering
Judah to be thus harassed: - 1. The punishment of the sins of Manasseh,
which God now visited upon the third and fourth generation. So long he
waited before he visited them, to see if the nation would repent; but
they continued impenitent, notwithstanding Josiah's endeavours to reform
them, and ready to relapse, upon the first turn, into their former
idolatries. Now that the old bond was put in suit they were called up
upon the former judgment; that was revived which God had laid up in
store, and sealed among his treasures ([Deu
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#034.md); [Job
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#017).md), and in remembrance of that he
removed Judah out of his sight, and let the world know that time will
not wear out the guilt of sin and that reprieves are not pardons. All
that Manasseh did was called to mind, but especially the innocent blood
that he shed, much of which, we may suppose, was the blood of God's
witnesses and worshippers, which the Lord would not pardon. Is there
then any unpardonable sin but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost? This
is meant of the remitting of the temporal punishment. Though Manasseh
repented, and we have reason to think even the persecutions and murders
he was guilty of were pardoned, so that he was delivered from the wrath
to come; yet, as they were national sins, they lay still charged upon
the land, crying for national judgments. Perhaps some were now living
who were aiding and abetting; and the present king was guilty of
innocent blood, as appears [Jer 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#017.md).
See what a provoking sin murder is, how loud it cries, and how long. See
what need nations have to lament the sins of their fathers, lest they
smart for them. God intended hereby the accomplishment of the
prophecies; it was according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke by
his servants the prophets. Rather shall Judah be removed out of his
sight, nay, rather shall heaven and earth pass away, than any word of
God fall to the ground. Threatenings will be fulfilled as certainly as
promises, if the sinner's repentance prevent not.

III\. The king of Egypt was likewise subdued by the king of Babylon, and
a great part of his country taken from him, [Kg2
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007.md). It was but lately that he had
oppressed Israel, [Kg2 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#033.md). Now he
is himself brought down and disabled to attempt any thing for the
recovery of his losses or the assistance of his allies. He dares not
come any more out of his land. Afterwards he attempted to give Zedekiah
some relief, but was obliged to retire, [Jer
37:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#007.md).

IV\. Jehoiakim, seeing his country laid waste and himself ready to fall
into the enemy's hand, as it should seem, died of a broken heart, in the
midst of his days ([Kg2 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#006).md). So
Jehoiakim slept with his fathers; but it is not said that he was buried
with them, for no doubt the prophecy of Jeremiah was fulfilled, that he
should not be lamented, as his father was, but buried with the burial of
an ass ([Jer 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018.md), [Jer
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#019).md), and his dead body cast out,
[Jer 36:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#030.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 24:8</span></span>

This should have been the history of king Jehoiachin's reign, but, alas!
it is only the history of king Jehoiachin's captivity, as it is called,
[Eze 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#002.md). He came to the crown, not to
have the honour of wearing it, but the shame of losing it. Ideo tantum
venerat, ut exiret - He came in only to go out.

I. His reign was short and inconsiderable. He reigned but three months,
and then was removed and carried captive to Babylon, as his father, it
is likely, would have been if he had lived but so much longer. What an
unhappy young prince was this, that was thrust into a falling house, a
sinking throne! What an unnatural father had he, who begat him to suffer
for him, and by his own sin and folly had left himself nothing to
bequeath to his son but his own miseries! Yet this young prince reigned
long enough to show that he justly smarted for his fathers' sins, for he
trod in their steps ([Kg2 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#009).md): He
did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as they had done; he
did nothing to cut off the entail of the curse, to discharge the
incumbrances of his crown, and therefore (transit cum onere - the
incumbrance descends with the crown) with his own iniquity that of his
fathers shall come into the account.

II\. The calamities that came upon him, and his family, and people, in
the very beginning of his reign, were very grievous. 1. Jerusalem was
besieged by the king of Babylon, [Kg2
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#010.md), [Kg2
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#011.md). He had sent his forces to
ravage the country, [Kg2 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002.md). Now he
came himself, and laid siege to the city. Now the word of God was
fulfilled ([Deu 28:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049), etc..md), The Lord
shall bring a nation against thee from far, of fierce countenance, that
shall first eat of the fruit of thy land and then besiege thee in all
thy gates. 2. Jehoiachin immediately surrendered at discretion. As soon
as he heard the king of Babylon had come in person against the city, his
name having at this time become very formidable, he beat a parley and
went out to him, [Kg2 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012.md). Had he
made his peace with God, and taken the method that Hezekiah did in the
like case, he needed not to have feared the king of Babylon, but might
have held out with courage, honour, and success (one should have chased
a thousand); but, wanting the faith and piety of an Israelite, he had
not the resolution of a man, of a soldier, of a prince. He and his royal
family, his mother and wives, his servants and princes, delivered
themselves up prisoners of war; this was the consequence of their being
servants of sin. 3. Nebuchadnezzar rifled the treasuries both of the
church and of the state, and carried away the silver and gold of both,
[Kg2 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#013.md). Now the word of God by
Isaiah was fulfilled ([Kg2 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#017).md), All
that is in thy house shall be carried to Babylon. Even the vessels of
the temple which Solomon had made, and laid up in store to be used as
the old ones were worn out, he cut off from the temple, and began to cut
them in pieces, but, upon second thoughts, reserved them for his own
use, for we find Belshazzar drinking wine in them, [Dan
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#002.md), [Dan
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#003.md). 4. He carried away a great part
of Jerusalem into captivity, to weaken it, that he might effectually
secure to himself the dominion of it and prevent its revolt, and to
enrich himself with the wealth or service of those he took away. There
had been some carried away eight years before this, in the first year of
Nebuchadnezzar and the third of Jehoiakim, among whom were Daniel and
his fellows. See [Dan 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md), [Dan
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#006.md). They had approved themselves so
well that this politic prince coveted more of them. Now he carried off,
(1.) The young king himself and his family ([Kg2
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#015).md), and we find ([Kg2
25:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#027).md) that for thirty-seven years
he continued a close prisoner. (2.) All the great men, the princes and
officers, whose riches were kept for the owners thereof to their hurt
([Ecc 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#013).md), tempting the enemies to
make a prey of them first. (3.) All the military men, the mighty men of
valour ([Kg2 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014).md), the mighty of the
land ([Kg2 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#015).md), the men of might,
even all that were strong and apt for war, [Kg2
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#016.md). These could not defend
themselves, and the conqueror would not leave them to defend their
country, but took them away, to be employed in his service. (4.) All the
craftsmen and smiths who made weapons of war; in taking them he did, in
effect, disarm the city, according to the Philistines' policy, [Sa1
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#019.md). In this captivity Ezekiel the
prophet was carried away ([Eze 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md),
[Eze 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#002).md) and Mordecai, [Est
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#006.md). This Jehoiachin was also called
Jeconiah ([Ch1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#016).md), and in contempt
([Jer 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024.md), where his captivity is
foretold) Coniah.

III\. The successor whom the king of Babylon appointed in the room of
Jehoiachin. God had written him childless ([Jer
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#030).md) and therefore his uncle was
entrusted with the government. The king of Babylon made Mattaniah king,
the son of Josiah; and to remind him, and let all the world know, that
he was his creature, he changed his name and called him Zedekiah, [Kg2
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#017.md). God had sometimes charged it
upon his people, They have set up kings, but not by me ([Hos
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004).md), and now, to punish them for
that, the king of Babylon shall have the setting up of their kings.
Those are justly deprived of their liberty that use it, and insist upon
it, against God's authority. This Zedekiah was the last of the kings of
Judah. The name which the king of Babylon gave him signifies The justice
of the Lord, and was a presage of the glorifying of God's justice in his
ruin. 1. See how impious this Zedekiah was. Though the judgments of God
upon his three immediate predecessors might have been a warning to him
not to tread in their steps, yet he did that which was evil, like all
the rest, [Kg2 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#019.md). 2. See how
impolitic he was. As his predecessor lost his courage, so he his wisdom,
with his religion, for he rebelled against the king of Babylon ([Kg2
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#020).md), whose tributary he was, and so
provoked him whom he was utterly unable to contend with, and who, if he
had continued true to him, would have protected him. This was the most
foolish thing he could do, and hastened the ruin of his kingdom. This
came to pass through the anger of the Lord, that he might cast them out
from his presence. Note, When those that are entrusted with the counsels
of a nation act unwisely, and against their true interest, we ought to
take notice of the displeasure of God in it. It is for the sins of a
people that God removes the speech of the trusty and takes away the
understanding of the aged, and hides from their eyes the things that
belong to the public peace. Whom God will destroy he infatuates.
