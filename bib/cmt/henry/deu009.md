### [Deuteronomy Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 9:0</span></span>

The design of Moses in this chapter is to convince the people of Israel
of their utter unworthiness to receive from God those great favours that
were now to be conferred upon them, writing this, as it were, in capital
letters at the head of their charter, "Not for your sake, be it known
unto you," [Eze 36:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#032.md). I. He assures
them of victory over their enemies ([Deu
9:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001).md). II. He cautions them not to
attribute their successes to their own merit, but to God's justice,
which was engaged against their enemies, and his faithfulness, which was
engaged to their fathers ([Deu 9:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#004).md).
III. To make it evident that they had no reason to boast of their own
righteousness, he mentions their faults, shows Israel their
transgressions, and the house of Jacob their sins. In general, they had
been all along a provoking people (v. 7-24). In particular, 1. In the
matter of the golden calf, the story of which he largely relates ([Deu
9:8-21](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#008).md). 2. He mentions some other
instances of their rebellion ([Deu
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#022.md), [Deu
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#023).md). And, 3. Returns, at [Deu
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#025.md), to speak of the intercession he
had made for them at Horeb, to prevent their being ruined for the golden
calf.

[Deuteronomy 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 9:1</span></span>

The call to attention ([Deu 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001).md),
Hear, O Israel, intimates that this was a new discourse, delivered at
some distance of time after the former, probably the next sabbath day.

I. Moses represents to the people the formidable strength of the enemies
which they were now to encounter, [Deu
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001.md). The nations they were to
dispossess were mightier than themselves, not a rude and undisciplined
rout, like the natives of America, that were easily made a prey of. But,
should they besiege them, they would find their cities well fortified,
according as the art of fortification then was; should they engage them
in the field, they would find the people great and tall, of whom common
fame had reported that there was no standing before them, [Deu
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#002.md). This representation is much the
same with that which the evil spies had made ([Num
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#028.md), [Num
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#033).md), but made with a very different
intention: that was designed to drive them from God and to discourage
their hope in him; this to drive them to God and to engage their hope in
him, since no power less than that which is almighty could secure and
prosper them.

II\. He assures them of victory, by the presence of God with them,
notwithstanding the strength of the enemy, [Deu
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#003.md). "Understand therefore what thou
must trust to for success, and which way thou must look; it is the Lord
thy God that goes before thee, not only as thy captain, or
commander-in-chief, to give direction, but as a consuming fire, to do
execution among them. Observe, He shall destroy them, and then thou
shalt drive them out. Thou canst not drive them out, unless he destroy
them and bring them down. But he will not destroy them and bring them
down, unless thou set thyself in good earnest to drive them out." We
must do our endeavour in dependence upon God's grace, and we shall have
that grace if we do our endeavour.

III\. He cautions them not to entertain the least thought of their own
righteousness, as if that had procured them this favour at God's hand:
"Say not. For my righteousness (either with regard to my good character
or in recompence for any good service) the Lord hath brought me in to
possess this land ([Deu 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#004).md); never
think it is for thy righteousness or the uprightness of thy heart, that
it is in consideration either of thy good conversation or of they good
disposition," [Deu 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#005.md). And again
([Deu 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#006).md) it is insisted on, because
it is hard to bring people from a conceit of their own merit, and yet
very necessary that it be done: "Understand (know it, and believe it,
and consider it) that the Lord thy God giveth thee not this land for thy
righteousness. Hadst thou been to come to it upon that condition, thou
wouldst have been for ever shut out of it, for thou art a stiff-necked
people." Note, Our gaining possession of the heavenly Canaan, as it must
be attributed to God's power and not to our own might, so it must be
ascribed to God's grace and not to our own merit: in Christ we have both
righteousness and strength; in him therefore we must glory, and not in
ourselves, or any sufficiency of our own.

IV\. He intimates to them the true reasons why God would take this good
land out of the hands of the Canaanites, and settle it upon Israel, and
they are borrowed from his own honour, not from Israel's deserts. 1. He
will be honoured in the destruction of idolaters; they are justly looked
upon as haters of him, and therefore he will visit their iniquity upon
them. It is for the wickedness of these nations that God drives them
out, [Deu 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#004.md), and again, [Deu
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#005.md). All those whom God rejects are
rejected for their own wickedness: but none of those whom he accepts are
accepted for their own righteousness. 2. He will be honoured in the
performance of his promise to those that are in covenant with him: God
swore to the patriarchs, who loved him and left all to follow him, that
he would give this land to their seed; and therefore he would keep that
promised mercy for thousands of those that loved him and kept his
commandments; he would not suffer his promise to fail. It was for their
fathers' sakes that they were beloved, [Rom
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#028.md). Thus boasting is for ever
excluded. See [Eph 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009.md), [Eph
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011.md).

[Deuteronomy 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 9:7</span></span>

That they might have no pretence to think that God brought them to
Canaan for their righteousness, Moses here shows them what a miracle of
mercy it was that they had not long ere this been destroyed in the
wilderness: "Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the Lord thy
God ([Deu 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#007).md); so far from purchasing
his favour, thou hast many a time laid thyself open to his displeasure."
Their fathers' provocations are here charged upon them; for, if God had
dealt with their fathers according to their deserts, this generation
would never have been, much less would they have entered Canaan. We are
apt to forget our provocations, especially when the smart of the rod is
over, and have need to be often put in mind of them, that we may never
entertain any conceit of our own righteousness. Paul argues from the
guilt which all mankind is under to prove that we cannot be justified
before God by our own works, [Rom
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019.md), [Rom
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020.md). If our works condemn us, they
will not justify us. Observe, 1. They had been a provoking people ever
since they came out of Egypt, [Deu
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#007.md). Forty years long, from first to
last, were God and Moses grieved with them. It is a very sad character
Moses now at parting leaves of them: You have been rebellious since the
day I knew you, [Deu 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#024.md). No sooner
were they formed into a people than there was a faction formed among
them, which upon all occasions made head against God and his government.
Though the Mosaic history records little more than the occurrences of
the first and last year of the forty, yet it seems by this general
account that the rest of the years were not much better, but one
continued provocation. 2. Even in Horeb they made a calf and worshipped
it, [Deu 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#008.md), etc. That was a sin so
heinous, and by several aggravations made so exceedingly sinful, that
they deserved upon all occasions to be upbraided with it. It was done in
the very place where the law was given by which they were expressly
forbidden to worship God by images, and while the mountain was yet
burning before their eyes, and Moses had gone up to fetch them the law
in writing. They turned aside quickly, [Deu
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#016.md). 3. God was very angry with them
for their sin. Let them not think that God overlooked what they did
amiss, and gave them Canaan for what was good among them. No, God had
determined to destroy them ([Deu 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#008).md),
could easily have done it, and would have been no loser by it; he even
desired Moses to let him alone that he might do it, [Deu
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#013.md), [Deu
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#014.md). By this it appeared how heinous
their sin was, for God is never angry with any above what there is cause
for, as men often are. Moses himself, though a friend and favourite,
trembled at the revelation of God's wrath from heaven against their
ungodliness and unrighteousness ([Deu
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#019).md): I was afraid of the anger of
the Lord, afraid perhaps not for them only, but for himself, [Psa
119:120](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#120.md). 4. They had by their sin
broken covenant with God, and forfeited all the privileges of the
covenant, which Moses signified to them by breaking the tables, [Deu
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#017.md). A bill of divorce was given
them, and thenceforward they might justly have been abandoned for ever,
so that their mouth was certainly stopped from pleading any
righteousness of their own. God had, in effect, disowned them, when he
said to Moses ([Deu 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#012).md), "They are
thy people, they are none of mine, nor shall they be dealt with as
mine." 5. Aaron himself fell under God's displeasure for it, though he
was the saint of the Lord, and was only brought by surprise or terror to
be confederate with them in the sin: The Lord was very angry with Aaron,
[Deu 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#020.md). No man's place or character
can shelter him from the wrath of God if he have fellowship with the
unfruitful works of darkness. Aaron, that should have made atonement for
them if the iniquity could have been purged away by sacrifice and
offering, did himself fall under the wrath of God: so little did they
consider what they did when they drew him in. 6. It was with great
difficulty and very long attendance that Moses himself prevailed to turn
away the wrath of God, and prevent their utter ruin. He fasted and
prayed full forty days and forty nights before he could obtain their
pardon, [Deu 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#018.md). And some think
twice forty days ([Deu 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#025).md), because
it is said, as I fell down before, whereas his errand in the first forty
was not of that nature. Others think it was but one forty, though twice
mentioned (as also in [Deu 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#010).md); but
this was enough to make them sensible how great God's displeasure was
against them, and what a narrow escape they had for their lives. And in
this appears the greatness of God's anger against all mankind that no
less a person than his Son, and no less a price than his own blood,
would serve to turn it away. Moses here tells them the substance of his
intercession for them. He was obliged to own their stubbornness, and
their wickedness, and their sin, [Deu
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#027.md). Their character was bad indeed
when he that appeared an advocate for them could not give them a good
word, and had nothing else to say in their behalf but that God had done
great things for them, which really did but aggravate their crime ([Deu
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#026).md), - that they were the posterity
of good ancestors ([Deu 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#027).md), which
might also have been turned upon him, as making the matter worse and not
better, - and that the Egyptians would reproach God, if he should
destroy them, as unable to perfect what he had wrought for them ([Deu
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#028).md), a plea which might easily
enough have been answered: no matter what the Egyptians say, while the
heavens declare God's righteousness; so that the saving of them from
ruin at that time was owing purely to the mercy of God, and the
importunity of Moses, and not to any merit of theirs, that could be
offered so much as in mitigation of their offence. 7. To affect them the
more with the destruction they were then at the brink of, he describes
very particularly the destruction of the calf they had made, [Deu
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#021.md). He calls it their sin: perhaps
not only because it had been the matter of their sin, but because the
destroying of it was intended for a testimony against their sin, and an
indication to them what the sinners themselves did deserve. Those that
made it were like unto it, and would have had no wrong done them if they
had been thus stamped to dust, and consumed, and scattered, and no
remains of them left. It was infinite mercy that accepted the
destruction of the idol instead of the destruction of the idolaters. 8.
Even after this fair escape that they had, in many other instances they
provoked the Lord again and again. He needed only to name the places,
for they carried the memorials either of the sin or of the punishment in
their names ([Deu 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#022).md): at Taberah,
burning, where God set fire to them for their murmuring, - at Massah,
the temptation, where they challenged almighty power to help them, - and
at Kibroth-hattaavah, the graves of lusters, where the dainties they
coveted were their poison; and, after these, their unbelief and distrust
at Kadesh-barnea, of which he had already told them (ch. 1), and which
he here mentions again ([Deu 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#023).md),
would certainly have completed their ruin if they had been dealt with
according to their own merits.

Now let them lay all this together, and it will appear that whatever
favour God should hereafter show them, in subduing their enemies and
putting them in possession of the land of Canaan, it was not for their
righteousness. It is good for us often to remember against ourselves,
with sorrow and shame, our former sins, and to review the records
conscience keeps of them, that we may see how much we are indebted to
free grace, and may humbly own that we never merited at God's hand any
thing but wrath and the curse.
