### [Hosea Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md)

[Hosea](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hos 4:0</span></span>

Prophets were sent to be reprovers, to tell people of their faults, and
to warn them of the judgments of God, to which by sin they exposed
themselves; so the prophet is employed in this and the following
chapters. He is here, as counsel for the King of kings, opening an
indictment against the people of Israel, and labouring to convince them
of sin, and of their misery and danger because of sin, that he might
prevail with them to repent and reform. I. He shows them what were the
grounds of God's controversy with them, a general prevalency of vice and
profaneness ([Hos 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md), [Hos
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#002).md), ignorance and forgetfulness of
God ([Hos 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006.md), [Hos
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#007).md), the worldly-mindedness of the
priests ([Hos 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#008).md), drunkenness and
uncleanness ([Hos 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#011).md), using
divination and witchcraft ([Hos 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#012).md),
offering sacrifice in the high places ([Hos
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#013).md), whoredoms ([Hos
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#014.md), [Hos
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018).md), and bribery among magistrates
([Hos 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018).md). II. He shows them what
would be the consequences of God's controversy. God would punish them
for these things ([Hos 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#009).md). The whole
land should be laid waste ([Hos 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#003).md),
all sorts of people cut off ([Hos
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#005).md), their honour lost ([Hos
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#007).md), their creature-comforts
unsatisfying ([Hos 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#010).md), and
themselves made ashamed ([Hos 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#019).md).
And, which is several times mentioned here as the sorest judgment of
all, they should be let alone in their sins ([Hos
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#017).md), they shall not reprove one
another ([Hos 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#004).md), God will not
punish them ([Hos 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#014).md), nay, he will
let them prosper ([Hos 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#016).md). III. He
gives warning to Judah not to tread in the steps of Israel, because they
saw their steps went down to hell ([Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015).md).

[Hosea 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 4:1</span></span>

Here is, I. The court set, and both attendance and attention demanded:
"Hear the word of the Lord, you children of Israel, for to you is the
word of this conviction sent, whether you will hear or whether you will
forbear." Whom may God expect to give him a fair hearing, and take from
him a fair warning, but the children of Israel, his own professing
people? Yea, they will be ready enough to hear when God speaks
comfortably to them; but are they willing to hear when he has a
controversy with them? Yes, they must hear him when he pleads against
them, when he has something to lay to their charge: The Lord has a
controversy with the inhabitants of the land, of this land, of this holy
land. Note, Sin is the great mischief-maker; it sows discord between God
and Israel. God sees sin in his own people, and a good action he has
against them for it. Some more particular actions lie against his own
people, which do not lie against other sinners. He has a controversy
with them for breaking covenant with him, for bringing a reproach upon
him, and for an ungrateful return to him for his favours. God's
controversy will be pleaded, pleaded by the judgments of his mouth
before they are pleaded by the judgments of his hand, that he may be
justified in all he does and may make it appear that he desires not the
death of sinners; and God's pleadings ought to be attended to, for,
sooner or later, they shall have a hearing.

II\. The indictment read, by which the whole nation stands charged with
crimes of a heinous nature, by which God is highly provoked. 1. They are
charged with national omissions of the most important duties: There is
no truth nor mercy, neither justice nor charity, these most weighty
matters of the law, as our Saviour accounts them ([Mat
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023).md), judgment, mercy, and faith.
The generality of the people seemed to have no sense at all of the thing
called honesty; they made no conscience of what they said and did,
though ever so contrary to the truth and injurious to their neighbour.
Much less had they any sense of mercy, or any obligation they were under
to pity and help the poor. And it is not strange that there is no truth
and mercy when there is no knowledge of God in the land. What good can
be expected where there is no knowledge of God? It was the privilege of
that land that in Israel God was made known, and his name was great,
which was an aggravation of their sin, that they did not know him, [Psa
76:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md). 2. Hence follows national
commissions of the most enormous sins against both the first and second
table, for they had no regard at all to either. Swearing, and lying, and
killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, against the third,
ninth, sixth, eighth, and seventh commandments, were to be found in all
corners of the land, and among all orders and degrees of men among them,
[Hos 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#002.md). The corruption was
universal; what good people there were among them were either lost or
hid, or they hid themselves. By these they break out, that is, they
transgress all bounds of reason and conscience, and the divine law; they
have exceeded ([Job 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#009).md); they have
been overmuch wicked ([Ecc 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#017).md); they
suffer their corruptions to break out; they themselves break over, and
break through, all that stands in their way and would stop them in their
sinful career, as water overflows the banks. Note, Sin is a violent
thing and its power exorbitant; when men's hearts are fully set in them
to do evil ([Ecc 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011).md) what will be
restrained from them? [Gen 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#006.md). When
they break out thus blood touches blood, that is, abundance of murders
are committed in all parts of the country, and, as it were, in a
constant series and succession. Caedes aliae aliis sunt contiguae -
Murders touch murders; a stream of blood runs down among them, even
royal blood. It was about this time that there was so much blood shed in
grasping at the crown; Shallum slew Zechariah, and Menahem slew Shallum,
Pekah slew Pekahiah, and Hoshea slew Pekah; and the like bloody work, it
is likely, there was among other contenders, so that the land was
polluted with blood ([Psa 106:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#038).md); it
was filled with blood from one end to the other, [Kg2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#016.md).

III\. Sentence passed upon this guilty and polluted land, [Hos
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#003.md). It shall be utterly destroyed and
laid waste. The whole land is infected with sin, and therefore the whole
land shall mourn under God's sore judgments, shall sit in mourning,
being stripped of all its wealth and beauty. As the valleys are said to
shout for joy, and sing, when there are plenty and peace, so here they
are said to mourn when by war and famine they are made desolate. The
whole land shall be brimstone, and salt, and burning, was as threatened
in the law, [Deu 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023.md). They had
broken all God's commandments, and now God threatens to take away all
their comforts. The land mourns when there is neither grass for the
cattle nor herbs for the service of man; and then every one that dwells
therein shall languish for want of nice food to support a wasting life,
and fret for want of the usual dainties for delight. The beasts of the
field will languish, [Jer 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#005.md), [Jer
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#006.md). Nay, the destruction of the
fruits of the earth shall be so great that there shall not be picking
for the fowls of the air, to keep them alive; they shall suffer with
man, and their dying, or growing lean, will be a punishment to those who
used to have their tables replenished with wild-fowl. Nay, the fishes of
the sea shall be taken away, or gathered together, that they may go away
in shoals to some other coast, and then the fishing trade will be worth
nothing. This desolation shall be in that respect more general than that
by Noah's flood, for that did not affect the fishes of the sea, but this
shall. It was part of one of the plagues of Egypt that he slew their
fish ([Psa 105:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#029).md); when the waters
are dried the fish die, [Isa 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#002.md);
[Zep 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#002.md), [Zep
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#003.md). Note, When man becomes
disobedient to God, it is just that the inferior creatures should be
made unserviceable to man. Oh what reason have we to admire God's
patience and mercy to our land, that though there is in it so much
swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and adultery, yet there
is plenty of flesh, and fish, and fowl, on our tables!

IV\. An order of court that no pains should be taken with the condemned
criminal to bring him to repentance, with the reason for that order.
Observe, 1. The order itself ([Hos
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#004).md): Yet let no man strive nor
reprove another; let no means be used to reduce and reclaim them; let
their physicians give them up as desperate and past cure. It intimates
that as long as there is any hope we ought to reprove sinners for their
sins; it is a duty we owe to one another to give and to take reproofs;
it was one of the laws of Moses ([Lev
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#017).md), Thou shalt in any wise rebuke
thy neighbour; it is an instance of brotherly love. Sometimes there is
need to rebuke sharply, not only to reprove, but to strive, so loth are
men to part with their sins. But it is a sign that persons and people
are abandoned to ruin when God says, Let them not be reproved. Yet this
is to be understood as God's commands sometimes to the prophets not to
pray for them, notwithstanding which they did pray for them; but the
meaning is, They are so hardened in sin, and so ripened for ruin, that
it will be to little purpose either to deal with them or to deal with
God for them. Note, It bodes ill to a people when reprovers are
silenced, and when those who should witness against the sins of the
times, retire into a corner, and give up the cause. See [Ch2
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#016.md). 2. The reasons of this order.
Let them not reprove one another; for, (1.) They are determined to go on
in sin, and no reproofs will cure them of that: Thy people are as those
that strive with the priests; they have grown so very impudent in sin,
so very insolent, and impatient of reproof, that they will fly in the
face even of a priest himself if he should but give them the least
check, without any regard to his character and office; and how then can
it be thought that they should take a reproof from a private person?
Note, Those sinners have their hearts wickedly hardened who quarrel with
their ministers for dealing faithfully with them; and those who rebel
against ministerial reproof, which is an ordinance of God for their
reformation, have forfeited the benefit of brotherly reproof too.
Perhaps this may refer to the late wickedness of Joash king of Judah,
and his people, who stoned Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, for
delivering them a message from God, [Ch2
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#021.md). He was a priest; with him they
strove when he was officiating between the temple and the altar; and Dr.
Lightfoot thinks the prophet had an eye to his case when he spoke ([Hos
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#002).md) of blood touching blood; the
blood of the sacrificer was mingled with the blood of the sacrifice,
That, says he, was the apex of their wickedness - thence their ruin was
to be dated ([Mat 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035).md), as this is
of their incorrigibleness, that they are as those who strive with the
priest, therefore let no man reprove them; for, (2.) God also is
determined to proceed in their ruin ([Hos
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#005).md): "Therefore, because thou wilt
take no reproof, no advice, thou shalt fall, and it is in vain for any
to think of preventing it, for the decree has gone forth. Thou shalt
stumble and fall in the day, and the prophet, the false prophet that
flattered and seduced thee, shall fall with thee in the night; both thou
and thy prophet shall fall night and day, shall be continually falling
into one calamity or other; the darkness of the night shall not help to
cover thee from trouble nor the light of the day help thee to flee from
it." The prophets are blind leaders and the people blind followers; and
to the blind day and night are alike, so that whether it be day or night
both shall fall together into the ditch. "Thou shalt fall in the day,
when thy fall is least feared by thyself and thou art very secure; and
in the day, when it will be seen and observed by others, and turn most
to thy shame; and the prophet shall fall in the night, when to himself
it will be most terrible." Note, The ruin of those who have helped to
ruin others will, in a special manner, be intolerable. And did the
children think that when they were in danger of falling their mother
would help them? It shall be in vain to expect it, for I will destroy
thy mother, Samaria, the mother-city, the whole state, or kingdom, which
is as a mother to every part. It shall all be made silent. Note, When
all are involved in guilt nothing less can be expected than that all
should be involved in ruin.

[Hosea 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 4:6</span></span>

God is here proceeding in his controversy both with the priests and with
the people. The people were as those that strove with the priests ([Hos
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#004).md) when they had priests that did
their duty; but the generality of them lived in the neglect of their
duty, and here is a word for those priests, and for the people that love
to have it so, [Jer 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#031.md). And it is
observable here how the punishment answers to the sin, and how, for the
justifying of his own proceedings, God sets the one over-against the
other.

I. The people strove with the priests that should have taught them the
knowledge of God; justly therefore were they destroyed for lack of
knowledge, [Hos 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006.md). Note, Those that
rebel against the light can expect no other than to perish in the dark.
Or it is a charge upon the priests, who should have been still teaching
the people knowledge ([Ecc 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#009).md), but
they did not, or did it in such a manner that it was as if they had not
done it at all, so there was no knowledge of God in the land; and
because there was no vision, or none to any purpose, the people
perished, [Pro 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#018.md). Note, Ignorance
is so far from being the mother of devotion that it is the mother of
destruction; lack of knowledge is ruining to any person or people. They
are my people that are thus destroyed; their relation to God as his
people aggravates both their sin in not taking pains to get the
knowledge of that God whose command they were under and with whom they
were taken into covenant, and likewise the sin of those who should have
taught them; God set his children to school to them, and they never
minded them nor took any pains with them.

II\. Both priests and people rejected knowledge; and justly therefore
will God reject them. The reason why the people did not learn, and the
priests did not teach, was not because they had not the light, but
because they hated it - not because they had not ways of coming to the
knowledge of God and of communicating it, but because they had no heart
to it; they rejected it. They desired not the knowledge of God's ways,
but put it from them, and shut their eyes against the light; and
therefore "I will also reject thee; I will refuse to take cognizance of
thee and to own thee; you will not know me, but bid me depart; I will
therefore say, Depart from me, I know you not. Thou shalt be no priest
to me." 1. The priests shall be no longer admitted to the privileges, or
employed in the services, of the priesthood, nor shall they ever be
received again, as we find, [Eze
44:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#013.md). Note, Ministers that reject
knowledge, that are grossly ignorant and scandalous, ought not to be
owned as ministers; but that which they seem to have should be taken
away, [Luk 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#018.md). 2. The people shall
be no longer as they have been, a kingdom of priests, a royal
priesthood, [Exo 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006.md). God's people,
by rejecting knowledge, forfeit their honour and profane their own
crown.

III\. They forgot the law of God, neither desired nor endeavoured to
retain it in mind, nor to transmit the remembrance of it to their
posterity, and therefore justly will God forget them and their children,
the people's children; they did not educate them, as they ought to have
done, in the knowledge of God and their duty to him, and therefore God
will disown them, as not in covenant with him. Note, If parents do not
teach their children, when they are young, to remember their Creator,
they cannot expect that their Creator should remember them. Or it may be
meant of the priests' children; they shall not succeed them in the
priests' office, but shall be reduced to poverty, as is threatened
against Eli's house, [Sa1 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#020.md).

IV\. They dishonoured God with that which was their honour, and justly
therefore will God strip them of it, [Hos
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#007.md). It was their honour that they
were increased in number, wealth, power, and dignity. The beginning of
their nation was small, but in process of time it greatly increased, and
grew very considerable; the family of the priests increased wonderfully.
But, as they were increased, so they sinned against God. The more
populous the nation grew, the more sin was committed and the more
profane they were; their wealth, honour, and power, did but make them
the more daring in sin. Therefore, says God, will I change their glory
into shame. Are their numbers their glory? God will diminish them and
make them few. Is their wealth their glory? God will impoverish them and
bring them low; so that they shall themselves be ashamed of that which
they gloried in. Their priests shall be made contemptible and base, [Mal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#009.md). Note, That which is our honour,
if we dishonour God with it, will sooner or later be turned into shame
to us: for those that despise God shall be lightly esteemed, [Sa1
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#030.md).

V. The priests ate up the sin of God's people, and therefore they shall
eat and not have enough. 1. They abused the maintenance that was allowed
to the priests, to the priests of the house of Aaron, by the law of God,
and to the mock-priests of the calves by their constitution ([Hos
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#008).md): They eat up the sin of my
people, that is, their sin-offerings. If it be meant of the priests of
the calves, it intimates their seizing that which they had no right to;
they usurped the revenues of the priests, though they were no priests.
If it be meant of those who were legal priests, it intimates their
greediness of the profits and perquisites of their office, when they
took no care at all to do the duty of it. They feasted upon their part
of the offerings of the Lord, but forgot the work for which they were so
well paid. They set their heart upon the people's iniquities; they
lifted up their soul to them, that is, they were glad then people did
commit iniquity, that they might be obliged to bring an offering to make
atonement for it, which they should have their share of; the more sins
the more sacrifices, and therefore they cared not how much sin people
were guilty of. Instead of warning the people against sin, from the
consideration of the sacrifices, which showed them what an offence sin
was to God, since it needed such an expiation, they emboldened and
encouraged the people to sin, since an atonement might be made at so
small an expense. Thus they glutted themselves upon the sins of the
people, and helped to keep up that which they should have beaten down.
Note, It is a very wicked thing to be well pleased with the sins of
others because, in some way or other, they may turn to our advantage. 2.
God will therefore deny them his blessing upon their maintenance ([Hos
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#010).md): They shall eat and not have
enough. Though they have great plenty by the abundance of offerings that
are brought in, yet they shall have no satisfaction in it. Either their
food shall yield no good nourishment or their greedy appetites shall not
be satisfied with it. Note, What is unlawfully gained cannot be
comfortably used; no, nor that which is inordinately coveted; it is just
that the desires which are insatiable should always be unsatisfied, and
that those should never have enough who never know when they have
enough. See [Mic 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#014.md); [Hag
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#006.md).

VI\. The more they increased the more they sinned ([Hos
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#007).md), and therefore though they commit
whoredom, though they take the most wicked methods to multiply their
people, yet they shall not increase. Though they have many wives and
concubines, as Solomon had, yet they shall not have their families built
up thereby in a numerous progeny, any more than he had. Note, Those that
hope any way to increase by unlawful means will be disappointed. And
therefore God will thus blast all their projects because they have left
off to take heed to the Lord; time was when they had some regard to God,
and to his authority over them and interest in them, but they have left
it off; they take no heed to his word nor to his providences; they do
not eye him in either. They forsake him, so as not to take heed to him;
they have apostatized to such a degree that they have no manner of
regard to God, but are perfectly without God in the world. Note, Those
that leave off to take heed to the Lord leave off all good, and can
expect no other than that all good should leave them.

VII\. The people and the priests did harden one another in sin; and
therefore justly shall they be sharers in the punishment ([Hos
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#009).md): There shall be, like people,
like priest. So they were in character; people and priest were both
alike ignorant and profane, regardless of God and their duty, and
addicted to idolatry: and so they shall be in condition; God will bring
judgments upon them, that shall be the destruction both of priest and
people; the famine that deprives the people of their meat shall deprive
the priests of their meat-offerings, [Joe
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#009.md). It is part of the description of
a universal desolation that it shall be as with the people, so with the
priest, [Isa 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#002.md). God's judgments,
when they come with commission, will make no difference. Note, Sharers
in sin must expect to be sharers in ruin. Thus God will punish them both
for their ways, and reward them for their doings. God will cause their
doings to return upon them (so the word is); when a sin is committed the
sinner thinks it is gone and he shall hear no more of it, but he shall
find it called over again, and made to return, either to his humiliation
or to his condemnation.

VIII\. They indulged themselves in the delights of sense, to hold up
their hearts; but they shall find that they take away their hearts ([Hos
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#011).md): Whoredom, and wine, and new
wine take away the heart. Some join this with the foregoing words. They
have forsaken the Lord, to take heed to whoredom, and wine, and new
wine. Or, Because these have taken away their heart. Their sensual
pleasures have taken them off from their devotions and drowned all that
is good in them. Or we may take it as a distinct sentence, containing a
great truth which we see confirmed by every day's experience, that
drunkenness and uncleanness are sins which besot and infatuate men,
weaken and enfeeble them. They take away both the understanding and the
courage.

[Hosea 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 4:12</span></span>

In these verses we have, as before,

I. The sins charged upon the people of Israel, for which God had a
controversy with them, and they are,

1\. Spiritual whoredom, or idolatry. They have in them a spirit of
whoredoms, a strong inclination to that sin; the bent and bias of their
hearts are that way; it is their own iniquity; they are carried out
towards it with an unaccountable violence, and this causes them to err.
Note, The errors and mistakes of the judgment are commonly owing to the
corrupt affections; men therefore have a good opinion of sin, because
they have a disposition towards it. And having such erroneous notions of
idols, and such passionate motions towards them, no marvel that with
such a head and such a heart they have gone a whoring from under their
God, [Hos 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#012.md). They ought to have
been in subjection to him as their head and husband, to have been under
his guidance and command, but they revolted from their allegiance, and
put themselves under the guidance and protection of false gods. So ([Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015).md) Israel has played the harlot;
their conduct in the worship of their idols was like that of a harlot,
wanton and impudent. And ([Hos 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#016).md),
Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer, as an untamed heifer (so
some), or as a perverse or refractory one (so others), as a heifer that
is turned loose runs madly about the pasture, or, if put under the yoke
(which seems rather to be alluded to here), will draw back instead of
going forward, will struggle to get her neck out of the yoke and her
feet out of the furrow. Thus unruly, ungovernable, untractable, were the
people of Israel. They had begun to draw in the yoke of God's
ordinances, but they drew back, as children of Belial, that will not
endure the yoke; and when the prophets were sent with the goads of
reproof, to put them forward, they kicked against the pricks, and ran
backwards. The sum of all is ([Hos
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#017).md), Ephraim is joined to idols, is
perfectly wedded to them; his affections are glued to them, and his
heart is upon them. There are two instances given of their spiritual
whoredom, in both which they gave that honour to their idols which is
due to God only: - (1.) They consulted them as oracles, and used those
arts of divination which they had learned from their idolatrous priests
([Hos 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#012).md): My people ask counsel at
their stocks, their wooden gods; they apply to them for advice and
direction in what they should do and for information concerning the
event. They say to a stock, Thou art my father ([Jer
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#027).md); and, if it were indeed a
father, it were worthy of this honour; but it was a great affront to
God, who was indeed their Father, and whose lively oracles they had
among them, with which they had liberty to consult at any time, thus to
ask counsel at their stocks. And they expect that their staff should
declare to them what course they should take and what the event should
be. It is probable that this refers to some wicked methods of divination
used among the Gentiles, and which the Jews learned from them, by a
piece of wood, or by a staff, like Nebuchadnezzar's divining by his
arrows, [Eze 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#021.md). Note, Those who
forsake the oracles of God, to take their measures from the world and
the flesh, do in effect but consult with their stocks and their staves.
(2.) They offered sacrifice to them as gods, whose favour they wanted
and whose wrath they dreaded and deprecated ([Hos
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#013).md): They sacrifice to them, to
atone and pacify them, and burn incense to them, to please and gratify
them, and hope by both to recommend themselves to them. God had pitched
upon the place where he would record his name; but they, having forsaken
that, chose places for their irreligious rites which pleased their own
fancies; they chose, \[1.\] High places, upon the tops of the mountains
and upon the hills, foolishly imagining that the height of the ground
gave them some advantage in their approaches towards heaven. \[2.\]
Shady places, under oaks, and poplars, and elms, because the shadow
thereof is pleasant to them, especially in those hot countries, and
therefore they thought it was pleasing to their gods; or they fancied
that a thick shade befriends contemplation, possesses the mind with
something of awe, and therefore is proper for devotion.

2\. Corporal whoredom is another crime here charged upon them: They have
committed whoredom continually, [Hos
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018.md). They drove a trade of
uncleanness; it was not a single act now and then, but their constant
practice, as it is of many that have eyes full of adultery and which
cannot cease from that sin, [Pe2 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014.md).
Now the abominable filthiness and lewdness that was found in Israel is
here spoken of, (1.) As a concomitant of their idolatry; their false
gods drew them to it; for the devil whom they worshipped, though a
spirit, is an unclean spirit. Those that worshipped idols were separated
with harlots, and they sacrificed with harlots; for because they liked
not to retain God in their knowledge, but dishonoured him, therefore God
gave them up to vile affections, by the indulging of which they
dishonoured themselves, [Rom 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024.md),
[Rom 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028). (2..md) As a punishment of it.
The men that worshipped idols were separated with harlots that attended
the idolatrous rites, as in the worship of Baal-peor, [Num
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001.md), [Num
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#002.md). To punish them for that God gave
up their wives and daughters to the like vile affections: They committed
whoredom and adultery ([Hos 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#013).md),
which could not but be a great grief and reproach to their husbands and
parents; for those that are not chaste themselves desire to have their
wives and daughters so. But thus they might read their sin in their
punishment, as David's adultery was punished in the debauching of his
concubines by his own son, [Sa2 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#011.md).
Note, When the same sin in others is made men's grief and affliction
which they have themselves been guilty of they must own that the Lord is
righteous.

3\. The perverting of justice, [Hos
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018.md). Their rulers (be it spoken to
their shame) do love, Give ye, that is, they love bribes, and have it
continually in their mouths, Give, give. They are given to filthy lucre;
every one that has any business with them must expect to be asked, What
will you give? Though, as rulers, they are bound by office to do
justice, yet none can have justice done them without a fee; and you may
be sure that for a fee they will do injustice. Note, The love of money
is the ruin of equity and the root of all iniquity. But of all men it is
a shame for rulers (who should be men fearing God and hating
covetousness) to love Give ye. Perhaps this is intended in that part of
the charge here, Their drink is sour; it is dead; it is gone. Justice,
duly administered, is refreshing, like drink to the thirsty, but when it
is perverted, and rulers take rewards either to acquit the guilty or to
condemn the innocent, the drink is sour; they turn judgment into
wormwood, [Amo 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#007.md). Or it may refer in
general to the depraved morals of the whole nation; they had lost all
their life and spirit, and were as offensive to God as dead and sour
drink is to us. See [Deu 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032.md), [Deu
32:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#033.md).

II\. The tokens of God's wrath against them for their sins. 1. Their
wives and daughters should not be punished for the injury and disgrace
they did to their families ([Hos
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#014).md): I will not punish your
daughters; and, not being punished for their sin, they would go on in
it. Note, The impunity of one sinner is sometimes made the punishment of
another. Or, "I will not punish them as I will punish you; for you must
own, as Judah did concerning his daughter-in-law, that they are more
righteous than you," [Gen 38:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#026.md). 2.
They themselves should prosper for a while, but their prosperity should
help to destroy them. It comes in as a token of God's wrath ([Hos
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#016).md): The Lord will feed them as a
lamb in a large place; they shall have a fat pasture, and a large one,
in which they shall be fed to the full, and fed of the best, but it
shall be only to prepare them for the slaughter, as a lamb is that is so
fed. If they wax fat and kick, they do but wax fat for the butcher. But
others make them feed as a lamb on the common, a large place indeed, but
where it has short grass and lies exposed. The Shepherd of Israel will
turn them both out of his pastures and out of his protection. 3. No
means should be used to bring them to repentance ([Hos
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#017).md): "Ephraim is joined to idols, is
in love with them and addicted to them, and therefore let him alone, as
[Hos 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#004.md), Let no man reprove him. Let
him be given up to his own heart's lusts, and walk in his own counsel;
we would have healed him, and he would not be healed, therefore forsake
him," See what their end will be, [Deu
32:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#020.md). Note, It is a sad and sore
judgment for any man to be let alone in sin, for God to say concerning a
sinner, "He is joined to his idols, the world and the flesh; he is
incurably proud, covetous, or profane, an incurable drunkard or
adulterer; let him alone; conscience, let him alone; minister, let him
alone; providences, let him alone. Let nothing awaken him till the
flames of hell do it." The father corrects not the rebellious son any
more when he determines to disinherit him. "Those that are not disturbed
in their sin will be destroyed for their sin." 4. They should be hurried
away with a swift and shameful destruction ([Hos
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#019).md): The wind has bound her up in
her wings, to carry her away into captivity, suddenly, violently, and
irresistibly; he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, [Psa
58:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#009.md). And then they shall be ashamed
because of their sacrifices, ashamed of their sin in offering sacrifice
to idols, ashamed of their folly in putting themselves to such an
expense upon gods that have no power to help them, and thereby making
that God their enemy who has almighty power to destroy them. Note, There
are sacrifices that men will one day be ashamed of. Those that have
sacrificed their time, strength, honour, and all their comforts, to the
world and the flesh, will shortly be ashamed of it. Yea, and those that
bring to God blind, and lame, and heartless sacrifices, will be ashamed
of them too.

III\. The warning given to Judah not to sin after the similitude of
Israel's transgression. It is said in the close of [Hos
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#014.md), Those that do not understand
shall fall; those must needs fall that do not understand how to avoid,
or get over, the stumbling-blocks they meet with (and therefore let him
that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall), particularly the two
tribes ([Hos 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015).md): Though thou,
Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend. Though Israel be
given to idolatry, yet let not Judah take the infection. Now, 1. This
was a very needful caution. The men of Israel were brethren, and near
neighbours, to the men of Judah; Israel was more numerous, and at this
time in a prosperous condition, and therefore there was danger lest the
men of Judah should learn their way and get a snare to their souls.
Note, The nearer we are to the infection of sin the more need we have to
stand upon our guard. 2. It was a very rational caution: "Let Israel
play the harlot, yet let not Judah do so; for Judah has greater means of
knowledge than Israel, has the temple and priesthood, and a king of the
house of David; from Judah Shiloh is to come; and for Judah God has
reserved great blessings in store; therefore let not Judah offend, for
more is expected from them than from Israel, they will have more to
answer for if they do offend, and from them God will take it more
unkindly. If Israel play the harlot, let not Judah do so too, for then
God will have no professing people in the world." God bespeaks Judah
here, as Christ does the twelve, when many turned their backs upon him,
Will you also go away? [Joh 6:67](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#067.md).
Note, Those that have hitherto kept their integrity should, for that
reason, still hold it fast, even in times of general apostasy. Now, to
preserve Judah from offending as Israel had done, two rules are here
given: - (1.) That they might not be guilty of idolatry they must keep
at a distance from the places of idolatry: Come not you unto Gilgal,
where all their wickedness was ([Hos
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#015.md); [Hos
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011).md); there they multiplied
transgression ([Amo 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#004).md); and perhaps
they contracted a veneration for that place because there it was said to
Joshua, The place where thou standest is holy ground ([Jos
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#015).md); therefore they are forbidden to
enter into Gilgal, [Amo 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#005.md). And for
the same reason they must not go up to Bethel, here called the house of
vanity, for so Bethaven signifies, not the house of God, as Bethel
signifies. Note, Those that would be kept from sin, and not fall into
the devil's hands, must studiously avoid the occasions of sin and not
come upon the devil's ground. (2.) That they might not be guilty of
idolatry they must take heed of profaneness, and not swear, The Lord
liveth. They are commanded to swear, The Lord liveth in truth and
righteousness ([Jer 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#002).md); and
therefore that which is here forbidden is swearing so in untruth and
unrighteousness, swearing rashly and lightly, or falsely and with
deceit, or swearing by the Lord and the idol, [Zep
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005.md). Note, Those that would be steady
in their adherence to God must possess themselves with an awe and
reverence of God, and always speak of him with solemnity and
seriousness; for those that can make a jest of the true God will make a
god of any thing.
