[Lamentations](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lam 2:0</span></span>

The second alphabetical elegy is set to the same mournful tune with the
former, and the substance of it is much the same; it begins with Ecah,
as that did, "How sad is our case! Alas for us!" I. Here is the anger of
Zion's God taken notice of as the cause of her calamities ([Lam
2:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001).md). II. Here is the sorrow of
Zion's children taken notice of as the effect of her calamities ([Lam
2:10-19](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#010).md). III. The complaint is made
to God, and the matter referred to his compassionate consideration ([Lam
2:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#020).md). The hand that wounded must
make whole.

[Lamentations 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 2:1</span></span>

It is a very sad representation which is here made of the state of God's
church, of Jacob and Israel, of Zion and Jerusalem; but the emphasis in
these verses seems to be laid all along upon the hand of God in the
calamities which they were groaning under. The grief is not so much that
such and such things are done as that God has done them, that he appears
angry with them; it is he that chastens them, and chastens them in wrath
and in his hot displeasure; he has become their enemy, and fights
against them; and this, this is the wormwood and the gall in the
affliction and the misery.

I. Time was when God's delight was in his church, and he appeared to
her, and appeared for her, as a friend. But now his displeasure is
against her; he is angry with her, and appears and acts against her as
an enemy. This is frequently repeated here, and sadly lamented. What he
has done he has done in his anger; this makes the present day a
melancholy day indeed with us, that it is the day of his anger ([Lam
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001).md), and again ([Lam
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#002).md) it is in his wrath, and ([Lam
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#003).md) it is in his fierce anger, that
he has thrown down and cut off, and ([Lam
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#006).md) in the indignation of his anger.
Note, To those who know how to value God's favour nothing appears more
dreadful than his anger; corrections in love are easily borne, but
rebukes in love wound deeply. It is God's wrath that burns against Jacob
like a flaming fire ([Lam 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#003).md), and it
is a consuming fire; it devours round about, devours all her honours,
all her comforts. This is the fury that is poured out like fire ([Lam
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#004).md), like the fire and brimstone
which were rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah; but it was their sin that
kindled this fire. God is such a tender Father to his children that we
may be sure he is never angry with them but when they provoke him, and
give him cause to be angry; nor is he ever angry more than there is
cause for. God's covenant with them was that if they would obey his
voice he would be an enemy to their enemies ([Exo
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#022).md), and he had been so as long as
they kept close to him; but now he is an enemy to them; at least he is
as an enemy, [Lam 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#005.md). He has bent his
bow like an enemy, [Lam 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#004.md). He stood
with his right hand stretched out against them, and a sword drawn in it
as an adversary. God is not really an enemy to his people, no, not when
he is angry with them and corrects them in anger. We may be sorely
displeased against our dearest friends and relations, whom yet we are
far from having an enmity to. But sometimes he is as an enemy to them,
when all his providences concerning them seem in outward appearance to
have a tendency to their ruin, when every thing made against them and
nothing for them. But, blessed be God, Christ is our peace, our
peacemaker, who has slain the enmity, and in him we may agree with our
adversary, which it is our wisdom to do, since it is in vain to contend
with him, and he offers us advantageous conditions of peace.

II\. Time was when God's church appeared very bright, and illustrations,
and considerable among the nations; but now the Lord has covered the
daughter of Zion with a cloud ([Lam
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001).md), a dark cloud, which is very
terrible to himself, and through which she cannot see his face; a thick
cloud (so that word signifies), a black cloud, which eclipses all her
glory and conceals her excellency; not such a cloud as that under which
God conducted them through the wilderness, or that in which God took
possession of the temple and filled it with his glory: no, that side of
the cloud is now turned towards them which was turned towards the
Egyptians in the Red Sea. The beauty of Israel is now cast down from
heaven to the earth; their princes ([Sa2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#019).md), their religious worship, their
beauty of holiness, all that which recommended them to the affection and
esteem of their neighbours and rendered them amiable, which had lifted
them up to heaven, was now withered and gone, because God had covered it
with a cloud. He has cut off all the horn of Israel ([Lam
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#003).md), all her beauty and majesty ([Psa
132:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#017).md), all her plenty and fulness,
and all her power and authority. They had, in their pride, lifted up
their horn against God, and therefore justly will God cut off their
horn. He disabled them to resist and oppose their enemies; he turned
back their right hand, so that they were not able to follow the blow
which they gave nor to ward off the blow which was given them. What can
their right hand do against the enemy when God draws it back, and
withers it, as he did Jeroboam's? Thus was the beauty of Israel cast
down, when a people famed for courage were not able to stand their
ground nor make good their post.

III\. Time was when Jerusalem and the cities of Judah were strong and
well fortified, were trusted to by the inhabitants and let alone by the
enemy as impregnable. But now the lord has in anger swallowed them up;
they are quite gone; the forts and barriers are taken away, and the
invaders meet with no opposition: the stately structures, which were
their strength and beauty, are pulled down and laid waste. 1. The Lord
has in anger swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob ([Lam
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#002).md), both the cities and the country
houses; they are burnt, or otherwise destroyed, so totally ruined that
they seem to have been swallowed up, and no remains left of them. He has
swallowed up, and has not pitied. One would have thought it a pity that
such sumptuous houses, so well built, so well furnished, should be quite
destroyed, ad that some pity should have been had for the poor
inhabitants that were thus dislodged and driven to wander; but God's
wonted compassion seemed to fail: He has swallowed up Israel, as a lion
swallows up his prey, [Lam 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#005.md). 2. He
has swallowed up not only her common habitations, but her palaces, all
her palaces, the habitations of their princes and great men ([Lam
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#005).md), though those were most stately,
and strong, and rich, and well guarded. God's judgments, when they come
with commission, level palaces with cottages, and as easily swallow them
up. If palaces be polluted with sin, as theirs were, let them expect to
be visited with a curse, which shall consume them, with the timber
thereof and the stones thereof, [Zac
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#004.md). 3. He had destroyed not only
their dwelling-places, but their strong-holds, their castles, citadels,
and places of defence. These he has thrown down in his wrath, and
brought them to the ground; for shall they stand in the way of his
judgments, and give check to the progress of them? No; let them drop
like leaves in autumn; let them be rased to the foundations, and made to
touch the ground, [Lam 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#002.md). And again
([Lam 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#005).md), He has destroyed his
strong-holds; for what strength could they have against God? And thus he
increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation, for they
could not but be in a dreadful consternation when they saw all their
defence departed from them. This is again insisted on, [Lam
2:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#007.md). In order to the swallowing up
of her palaces, he has given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of
her palaces, which were their security, and, when they are broken down,
the palaces themselves are soon broken into. The walls of palaces cannot
protect them, unless God himself be a wall of fire round about them.
This God did in his anger, and yet he has done it deliberately. It is
the result of a previous purpose, and is done by a wise and steady
providence; for the Lord has purposed to destroy the wall of the
daughter of Zion; he brought the Chaldean army in on purpose to do this
execution. Note, Whatever desolations God makes in his church, they are
all according to his counsels; he performs the thing that is appointed
for us, even that which makes most against us. But, when it is done, he
has stretched out a line, a measuring line, to do it exactly and by
measure: hitherto the destruction shall go, and no further; no more
shall be cut off than what is marked to be so. Or it is meant of the
line of confusion ([Isa 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011).md), a
levelling line; for he will go on with his work; he has not withdrawn
his hand from destroying, that right hand which he stretched out against
his people as an adversary, [Lam 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#004.md).
As far as the purpose went the performance shall go, and his hand shall
accomplish his counsel to the utmost, and not be withdrawn. Therefore he
made the rampart and the wall, which the people had rejoiced in and upon
which perhaps they had made merry, to lament, and they languished
together; the walls and the ramparts, or bulwarks, upon them, fell
together, and were left to condole with one another on their fall. Her
gates are gone in an instant, so that one would think they were sunk
into the ground with their own weight, and he has destroyed and broken
her bars, those bars of Jerusalem's gates which formerly he had
strengthened, [Psa 147:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#013.md). Gates and
bars will stand us in no stead when God has withdrawn his protection.

IV\. Time was when their government flourished, their princes made a
figure, their kingdom was great among the nations, and the balance of
power was on their side; but now it is quite otherwise: He has polluted
the kingdom and the princes thereof, [Lam
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#002.md). They had first polluted
themselves with their idolatries, and then God dealt with them as with
polluted things; he threw them to the dunghill, the fittest place for
them. he has given up their glory, which was looked upon as sacred (that
is a character we give to majesty), to be trampled upon and profaned;
and no marvel that the king and the priest, whose characters were always
deemed venerable and inviolable, are despised by every body, when God
has, in the indignation of his anger, despised the king and the priest,
[Lam 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#006.md). He has abandoned them; he
looks upon them as no longer worthy of the honours conveyed to them by
the covenants of royalty and priesthood, but as having forfeited both;
and then Zedekiah the king was used despitefully, and Seraiah the chief
priest put to death as a malefactor. The crown has fallen from their
heads, for her king and her princes are among the Gentiles, prisoners
among them, insulted over by them ([Lam
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#009).md), and treated not only as common
persons, but as the basest, without any regard to their character. Note,
It is just with God to debase those by his judgments who have by sin
debased themselves.

V. Time was when the ordinances of God were administered among them in
their power and purity, and they had those tokens of God's presence with
them; but now those were taken from them, that part of the beauty of
Israel was gone which was indeed their greatest beauty. 1. The ark was
God's footstool, under the mercy-seat, between the cherubim; this was of
all others the most sacred symbol of God's presence (it is called his
footstool, [Ch1 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002.md); [Psa
99:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#005.md); [Psa
132:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#007).md); there the Shechinah rested,
and with an eye to this Israel was often protected and saved; but now he
remembered not his footstool. The ark itself was suffered, as it should
seem, to fall into the hands of the Chaldeans. God, being angry, threw
that away; for it shall be no longer his footstool; the earth shall be
so, as it had been before the ark was, [Isa
66:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001.md). Of what little value are the
tokens of his presence when his presence is gone! Nor was this the first
time that God agave his ark into captivity, [Psa
78:61](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#061.md). God and his kingdom can stand
without that footstool. 2. Those that ministered in holy things had been
pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion ([Lam
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#004).md); they had been purer than snow,
whiter than mile ([Lam 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007).md); none more
pleasant in the eyes of all good people than those that did the service
of the tabernacle. But now these are slain, and their blood is mingled
with their sacrifices. Thus is the priest despised as well as the king.
Note, When those that were pleasant to the eye in Zion's tabernacle are
slain God must be acknowledged in it; he has done it, and the burning
which the Lord has kindled must be bewailed but the whole house of
Israel, as in the case of Nadab and Abihu, [Lev
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#006.md). 3. The temple was God's
tabernacle (as the tabernacle, while that was in being, was called his
temple, [Psa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004).md) and this he has
violently taken away ([Lam 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#006).md); he
has plucked up the stakes of it and cut the cords; it shall be no more a
tabernacle, much less his; he has taken it away, as the keeper of a
garden takes away his hovel or shade, when he has done with it and has
no more occasion for it; he takes it down as easily, as speedily, and
with a little regret and reluctance as if it were but a cottage in a
vineyard or a lodge in a garden of cucumbers ([Isa
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008).md), but a booth which the keeper
makes, [Job 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#018.md). When men profane
God's tabernacle it is just with him to take it from them. God has
justly refused to smell their solemn assemblies ([Amo
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#021).md); they had provoked him to
withdraw from them, and then no marvel that he has destroyed his places
of the assembly; what should they do with the places when the services
had become an abomination? He has now abhorred his sanctuary ([Lam
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#007).md); it has been defiled with sin,
that only thing which he hates, and for the sake of that he abhors even
his sanctuary, which he had delighted in and called his rest for ever,
[Psa 132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014.md). Thus he had done to
Shiloh. Now the enemies have made as great a noise of revelling and
blaspheming in the house of the Lord as ever had been made with the
temple-songs and music in the day of a solemn feast, [Psa
74:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#004.md). Some, by the places of the
assembly ([Lam 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#006).md), understand not
only the temple, but the synagogues, and the schools of the prophets,
which the enemy had burnt up, [Psa
74:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#008.md). 4. The solemn feasts and the
sabbaths had been carefully remembered, and the people constantly put in
mind of them; but now the Lord has caused those to be forgotten, not
only in the country, among those that lived at a distance, but even in
Zion itself; for there were none left to remember them, nor were there
the places left where they used to be observed. Now that Zion was in
ruins no difference was made between sabbath time and other times; every
day was a day of mourning, so that all the solemn feasts were forgotten.
Note, It is just with God to deprive those of the benefit and comfort of
sabbaths and solemn feasts who have not duly valued them, nor
conscientiously observed them, but have profaned them, which was one of
the sins that the Jews were often charged with. Those that have seen the
days of the Son of man, and slighted them, may desire to see one of
those days and not be permitted, [Luk
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#022.md). 5. The altar that had
sanctified their gifts is now cast off, for God will no more accept
their gifts, nor be honoured by their sacrifices, [Lam
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#007.md). The altar was the table of the
Lord, but God will no longer keep house among them; he will neither
feast them nor feast with them. 6. They had been blest with prophets and
teachers of the law; but now the law is no more ([Lam
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#009).md); it is no more read by the
people, no more expounded by the scribes; the tables of the law are gone
with the ark; the book of the law is taken from them, and the people are
forbidden to have it. What should those do with Bibles who had made no
better improvement of them when they had them? Her prophets also find no
vision from the Lord; God answers them no more by prophets and dreams,
which was the melancholy case of Saul, [Sa1
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#015.md). They had persecuted God's
prophets, and despised the visions they had from the Lord, and therefore
it is just with God to say that they shall have no more prophets, no
more visions. Let them go to the prophets that had flattered and
deceived them with visions of their own hearts, for they shall have none
from God to comfort them, or tell them how long. Those that misuse God's
prophets justly lose them.

[Lamentations 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lam 2:10</span></span>

Justly are these called Lamentations, and they are very pathetic ones,
the expressions of grief in perfection, mourning and woe, and nothing
else, like the contents of Ezekiel's roll, [Eze
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#010.md).

I. Copies of lamentations are here presented and they are painted to the
life. 1. The judges and magistrates, who used to appear in robes of
state, have laid them aside, or rather are stripped of them, and put on
the habit of mourners ([Lam 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#010).md); the
elders now sit no longer in the judgment-seats, the thrones of the house
of David, but they sit upon the ground, having no seat to repose
themselves in, or in token of great grief, as Job's friends sat with him
upon the ground, [Job 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#013.md). They open
not their mouth in the gate, as usual, to give their opinion, but they
keep silence, overwhelmed with grief, and not knowing what to say. They
have cast dust upon their heads, and girded themselves with sackcloth,
as deep mourners used to do; they had lost their power and wealth, and
that made the grieve thus. Ploratur lachrymis amissa pecunia veris -
Genuine are the tears which we shed over lost property. 2. The young
ladies, who used to dress themselves so richly, and walk with
stretched-forth necks ([Isa 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016).md), now
are humbled; The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the
ground; those are made to know sorrow who seemed to bid defiance to it
and were always disposed to be merry. 3. The prophet himself is a
pattern to the mourners, [Lam 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011.md).
His eyes do fail with tears; he has wept till he can weep no more, has
almost wept his eyes out, wept himself blind. Nor are the inward
impressions of grief short of the outward expressions. His bowels are
troubled, as they were when he saw these calamities coming ([Jer
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#019.md), [Jer
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#020).md), which, one would think, might
have excused him now; but even he, to whom they were no surprise, felt
them an insupportable grief, to such a degree that his liver is poured
out on the earth; he felt himself a perfect colliquation; all his
entrails were melted and dissolved, as [Psa
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014.md). Jeremiah himself had better
treatment than his neighbours, better than he had had before from his
own countrymen, nay, their destruction was his deliverance, their
captivity his enlargement; the same that made them prisoners made him a
favourite; and yet his private interests are swallowed up in a concern
for the public, and he bewails the destruction of the daughter of his
people as sensibly as if he himself had been the greatest sufferer in
that common calamity. Note, The judgments of God upon the land and
nation are to be lamented by us, though we, for our parts, may escape
pretty well.

II\. Calls to lamentation are here given: The heart of the people cried
unto the Lord, [Lam 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#018.md). Some fear it
was a cry, not of true repentance, but of bitter complaint; their heart
was as full of grief as it could hold, and they gave vent to it in
doleful shrieks and outcries, in which they made use of God's name; yet
we will charitably suppose that many of them did in sincerity cry unto
God for mercy in their distress; and the prophet bids them go on to do
so: "O wall of the daughter of Zion! either you that stand upon the
wall, you watchmen on the walls ([Isa
62:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006).md), when you see the enemies
encamped about the walls and making their approaches towards them, or
because of the wall (that is the subject of the lamentation), because of
the breaking down of the wall (which was not done till about a month
after the city was taken), because of this further calamity, let the
daughter of Zion lament still." This was a thing which Nehemiah lamented
long after, [Neh 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#003.md), [Neh
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#004.md). "Let tears run down like a river
day and night, weep without intermission, give thyself no rest from
weeping, let not the apple of thy eye cease." This intimates, 1. That
the calamities would be continuing, and the causes of grief would
frequently recur, and fresh occasion would be given them every day and
every night to bemoan themselves. 2. That they would be apt, by degrees,
to grow insensible and stupid under the hand of God, and would need to
be still called upon to afflict their souls yet more and more, till
their proud and hard hearts were thoroughly humbled and softened.

III\. Causes for lamentation are here assigned, and the calamities that
are to be bewailed are very particularly and pathetically described.

1\. Multitudes perish by famine, a very sore judgment, and piteous is
the case of those that fall under it. God had corrected them by scarcity
of provisions through want of rain some time before ([Jer
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#001).md), and they were not brought to
repentance by that lower degree of this judgment, and therefore now by
the straitness of the siege God brought it upon them in extremity; for,
(1.) The children died for hunger in their mothers' arms: The children
and sucklings, whose innocent and helpless state entitles them to relief
as soon as any, swoon in the streets ([Lam
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011).md) as the wounded ([Lam
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#012).md), there being no food to be had
for them; those that are starved die as surely as those that are
stabbed. They lie a great while crying to their poor mothers for corn to
feed them and wine to refresh them, for they are such as had been bred
up to the use of wine and wanted it now; but there is none for them, so
that at length their soul is poured into their mothers' bosom, and there
they breathe their last. This is mentioned again ([Lam
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#019).md): They faint for hunger in the
top of every street. Yet this is not the worst, (2.) There were some
little children that were slain by their mothers' hands and eaten, [Lam
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#020.md). Such was the scarcity of
provision that the women ate the fruit of their own bodies, even their
children when they were but of a span long, according to the
threatening, [Deu 28:53](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#053.md). The like was
done in the siege of Samaria, [Kg2
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#029.md). Such extremities, nay, such
barbarities, were they brought to by the famine. Let us, in our
abundance, thank God that we have food convenient, not only for
ourselves, but for our children.

2\. Multitudes fall by the sword, which devours one as well as another,
especially when it is in the hand of such cruel enemies as the Chaldeans
were. (1.) They spared no character, no, not the most distinguished;
even the priest and the prophet, who of all men, one would think, might
expect protection from heaven and veneration on earth, are slain, not
abroad in the field of battle, where they are out of their place, as
Hophni and Phinehas, but in the sanctuary of the Lord, the place of
their business and which they hoped would be a refuge to them. (2.) They
spared no age, no, not those who, by reason of their tender or their
decrepit age, were exempted from taking up the sword; for even they
perished by the sword. "The young, who have not yet come to bear arms,
and the old, who have had their discharge, lie on the ground, slain in
the streets, till some kind hand is found that will bury them." (3.)
They spared no sex: My virgins and my young men have fallen by the
sword. In the most barbarous military executions that ever we read of
the virgins were spared, and made part of the spoil ([Num
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#018.md), [Jdg
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#030).md), but here the virgins were put
to the sword, as well as the young men. (4.) This was the Lord's doing;
he suffered the sword of the Chaldeans to devour thus without
distinction: Thou has slain them in the day of thy anger, for it is God
that kills and makes alive, and saves alive, as he pleases. But that
which follows is very harsh: Thou has killed, and not pitied; for his
soul is grieved for the misery of Israel. The enemies that used them
thus cruelly were such as he had both mustered and summoned ([Lam
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#022).md): "Thou hast called in, as in a
solemn day, my terrors round about, that is, the Chaldeans, who are such
a terror to me;" enemies crowded into Jerusalem now as thickly as ever
worshippers used to do on a solemn festival, so that they were quite
overpowered with numbers, and none escaped nor remained; Jerusalem was
made a perfect slaughter-house. Mothers are cut to the heart to see
those whom they have taken such care of, and pains with, and whom they
have been so tender of, thus inhumanly used, suddenly cut off, though
not soon reared: Those that I have swaddled, and brought up, has my
enemy consumed, as if they were brought forth for the murderer, like
lambs for the butcher, [Hos 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#013.md).
Zion, who was a mother to them all, lamented to see those who were
brought up in her courts, and under the tuition of her oracles, thus
made a prey.

3\. Their false prophets cheated them, [Lam
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#014.md). This was a thing which Jeremiah
had lamented long before, and had observed with a great concern ([Jer
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#013).md): Ah! Lord God, the prophets say
unto them, You shall not see the sword; and here he inserts it among his
lamentations: Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee;
they pretended to discover for thee, and then to discover to thee, the
mind and will of God, to see the visions of the Almighty and then to
speak his words; but they were all vain and foolish things; their
visions were all their own fancies, and, if they thought they had any,
it was only the product of a crazed head or a heated imagination, as
appeared by what they delivered, which was all idle and impertinent:
nay, it is most likely that they themselves knew that the visions they
pretended were counterfeit, and all a sham, and made use of only to
colour that which they designedly imposed upon the people with, that
they might make an interest in them for themselves. They are thy
prophets, not God's prophets; he never sent them, nor were they pastors
after his heart, but the people set them up, told them what they should
say, so that they were prophets after their hearts. (1.) Prophets should
tell people of their faults, should show them their sins, that they may
bring them to repentance, and so prevent their ruin; but these prophets
knew that would lose them the people's affections and contributions, and
knew they could not reprove their hearers without reproaching themselves
at the same time, and therefore they have not discovered thy iniquity;
they saw it not themselves, or, if they did, saw so little evil in it,
or danger from it, that they would not tell them of it, though that
might have been a means, by taking away their iniquity, to turn away
their captivity. (2.) Prophets should warn people of the judgments of
God coming upon them, but these saw for them false burdens; the messages
they pretended to deliver to them from God they knew to be false, and
falsely ascribed to God; so that, by soothing them up in carnal
security, they caused that banishment which, by plain dealing, they
might have prevented.

4\. Their neighbours laughed at them ([Lam
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#015).md): All that pass by thee clap
their hands at thee. Jerusalem had made a great figure, got a great
name, and borne a great sway, among the nations; it was the envy and
terror of all about; and, when the city was thus reduced; they all (as
men are apt to do in such a case) triumphed in its fall; they hissed,
and wagged the head, pleasing themselves to see how much it had fallen
from its former pretensions. Is this the city (said they) that men
called the perfection of beauty? [Psa
50:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#002.md). How is it now the perfection of
deformity! Where is all its beauty now? Is this the city which was
called the joy of the whole earth ([Psa
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002).md), which rejoiced in the gifts of
God's bounty and grace more than any other place, and which all the
earth rejoiced in? Where is all its joy now and all its glorying? It is
a great sin thus to make a jest of others' miseries, and adds very much
affliction to the afflicted.

5\. Their enemies triumphed over them, [Lam
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#016.md). Those that wished ill to
Jerusalem and her peace now vent their spite and malice, which before
they concealed; they now open their mouths, nay, they widen them; they
hiss and gnash their teeth in scorn and indignation; they triumph in
their own success against her, and the rich prey they have got in making
themselves masters of Jerusalem: "We have swallowed her up; it is our
doing, and it is our gain; it is all our own now. Jerusalem shall never
be either courted or feared as she has been. Certainly this is the day
that we have long looked for; we have found it; we have seen it; aha! so
would we have it." Note, The enemies of the church are apt to take its
shocks for its ruins, and to triumph in them accordingly; but they will
find themselves deceived; for the gates of hell shall not prevail
against the church.

6\. Their God, in all this, appeared against them ([Lam
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#017).md): The Lord has done that which he
had devised. The destroyers of Jerusalem could have no power against her
unless it were given them from above. They are but the sword in God's
hand; it is he that has thrown down, and has not pitied. "In this
controversy of his with us we have not had the usual instances of his
compassion towards us." He has caused they enemy to rejoice over thee
(see [Job 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#011).md); he has set up the
horn of thy adversaries, has given them power and matter for pride. This
is indeed the highest aggravation of the trouble, that God has become
their enemy, and yet it is the strongest argument for patience under it;
we are bound to submit to what God does, for, (1.) It is the performance
of his purpose: The Lord has done that which he had devised; it is done
with counsel and deliberation, not rashly, or upon a sudden resolve; it
is the evil that he has framed ([Jer
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#011).md), and we may be sure it is
framed so as exactly to answer the intention. What God devises against
his people is designed for them, and so it will be found in the issue.
(2.) It is the accomplishment of his predictions; it is the fulfilling
of the scripture; he has now put in execution his word that he had
commanded in the days of old. When he gave them his law by Moses he told
them what judgments he would certainly inflict upon them if they
transgressed that law; and now that they have been guilty of the
transgression of this law he had executed the sentence of it, according
to [Lev 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016.md), etc., [Deu
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#015.md). Note, In all the providences of
God concerning his church it is good to take notice of the fulfilling of
his word; for there is an exact agreement between the judgments of God's
hand and the judgments of his mouth, and when they are compared they
will mutually explain and illustrate each other.

IV\. Comforts for the cure of these lamentations are here sought for and
prescribed.

1\. They are sought for and enquired after, [Lam
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#013.md). The prophet seeks to find out
some suitable acceptable words to say to her in this case: Wherewith
shall I comfort thee, O virgin! daughter of Zion? Note, We should
endeavour to comfort those whose calamities we lament, and, when our
passions have made the worst of them, our wisdom should correct them and
labour to make the best of them; we should study to make our sympathies
with or afflicted friends turn to their consolation. Now the two most
common topics of comfort, in case of affliction, are here tried, but are
laid by because they would not hold. We commonly endeavour to comfort
our friends by telling them, (1.) That their case is not singular, nor
without precedent; there are many whose trouble is greater, and lies
heavier upon them, than theirs does; but Jerusalem's case will not admit
this argument: "What thing shall I liken to thee, or what shall I equal
to thee, that I may comfort thee? What city, what country, is there,
whose case is parallel to thine? What witness shall I produce to prove
an example that will reach thy present calamitous state? Alas! there is
none, no sorrow like thine, because there is none whose honour was like
thine." (2.) We tell them that their case is not desperate, but that it
may easily be remedied; but neither will that be admitted here, upon a
view of human probabilities; for thy breach is great, like the sea, like
the breach which the sea sometimes makes upon the land, which cannot be
repaired, but still grows wider and wider. Thou art wounded, and who
shall heal thee? No wisdom nor power of man can repair the desolations
of such a broken shattered state. It is to no purpose therefore to
administer any of these common cordials; therefore,

2\. The method of cure prescribed is to address themselves to God, and
by a penitent prayer to commit their case to him, and to be instant and
constant in such prayers ([Lam 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#019).md):
"Arise out of thy dust, out of thy despondency, cry out in the night,
watch unto prayer; when others are asleep, be thou upon thy knees,
importunate with God for mercy; in the beginning of the watches, of each
of the four watches, of the night (let thy eyes prevent them, [Psa
119:148](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#148).md), then pour out thy heart like
water before the Lord, be free and full in prayer, be sincere and
serious in prayer, open thy mind, spread thy case before the Lord; lift
up thy hands towards him in holy desire and expectation; beg for the
life of thy young children. These poor lambs, what have they done? [Sa2
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#017.md). Take with you words, take with
you these words ([Lam 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#020).md), Behold, O
Lord! and consider to whom thou hast done this, with whom thou hast
dealt thus. Are they not thy own, the seed of Abraham thy friend and of
Jacob thy chosen? Lord, take their case into thy compassionate
consideration!" Note, Prayer is a salve for every sore, even the sorest,
a remedy for every malady, even the most grievous. And our business in
prayer is not to prescribe, but to subscribe to the wisdom and will of
God; to refer our case to him, and then to leave it with him. Lord,
behold and consider, and thy will be done.
