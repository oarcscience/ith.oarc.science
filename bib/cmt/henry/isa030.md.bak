### [Isaiah Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 30:0</span></span>

The prophecy of this chapter seems to relate (as that in the foregoing
chapter) to the approaching danger of Jerusalem and desolations of Judah
by Sennacherib's invasion. Here is, I. A just reproof to those who, in
that distress, trusted to the Egyptians for help, and were all in a
hurry to fetch succors from Egypt ([Isa
30:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#001).md). II. A terrible threatening
against those who slighted the good advice which God by his prophets
gave them for the repose of their minds in that distress, assuring them
that whatever became of others the judgment would certainly overtake
them ([Isa 30:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#008).md). III. A gracious
promise to those who trusted in God, that they should not only see
through the trouble, but should see happy days after it, times of joy
and reformation, plenty of the means of grace, and therewith plenty of
outward good things and increasing joys and triumphs ([Isa
30:18-26](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#018).md), and many of these promises
are very applicable to gospel grace. IV. A prophecy of the total rout
and ruin of the Assyrian army, which should be an occasion of great joy
and an introduction to those happy times ([Isa
30:27-33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#027).md).

[Isaiah 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 30:1</span></span>

It was often the fault and folly of the people of the Jews that, when
they were insulted by their neighbours on one side, they sought for
succour from their neighbours on the other side, instead of looking up
to God and putting their confidence in him. Against the Israelites they
sought to the Syrians, [Ch2 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#002.md), [Ch2
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#003.md). Against the Syrians they sought
to the Assyrians, [Kg2 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007.md). Against
the Assyrians they here sought to the Egyptians, and Rabshakeh upbraided
them with so doing, [Kg2 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#021.md). Now
observe here,

I. How this sin of theirs is described, and what there was in it that
was provoking to God. When they saw themselves in danger and distress,
1. They would not consult God. They would do things of their own heads,
and not advise with God, though they had a ready and certain way of
doing it by Urim or prophets. They were so confident of the prudence of
their own measures that they thought it needless to consult the oracle;
nay, they were not willing to put it to that issue: "They take counsel
among themselves, and one from another; but they do not ask counsel,
much less will they take counsel, of me. They cover with a covering"
(they think to secure themselves with one shelter or other, which may
serve to cover them from the violence of the storm), "but not of my
Spirit" (not such as God by his Spirit, in the mouth of his prophets,
directed them to), "and therefore it will prove too short a covering,
and a refuge of lies." 2. They could not confide in God. They did not
think it enough to have God on their side, nor were they at all
solicitous to make him their friend, but they strengthened themselves in
the strength of Pharaoh; they thought him a powerful ally, and doubted
not but to be able to cope with the Assyrian while they had him for
them. The shadow of Egypt (and it was but a shadow) was the covering in
which they wrapped themselves.

II\. What was the evil of this sin. 1. It bespoke them rebellious
children; and a woe is here denounced against them under that character,
[Isa 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#001.md). They were, in profession,
God's children; but, not trusting in him, they were justly stigmatized
as rebellious; for, if we distrust God's providence, we do in effect
withdraw ourselves from our allegiance. 2. They added sin to sin. It was
sin that brought them into distress; and then, instead of repenting,
they trespassed yet more against the Lord, [Ch2
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#022.md). And those that had abused God's
mercies to them, making them the fuel of their lusts, abused their
afflictions too, making them an excuse for their distrust of God; and so
they make bad worse, and add sin to sin; and those that do so, as they
make their own chain heavy, so it is just with God to make their plagues
wonderful. Now that which aggravated their sin was, (1.) That they took
so much pains to secure the Egyptians for their allies: They walk to go
down to Egypt, travel up and down to find an advantageous road thither;
but they have not asked at my mouth, never considered whether God would
allow and approve of it or no. (2.) That they were at such a vast
expense to do it, [Isa 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006.md). They load
the beasts of the south (horses fetched from Egypt, which lay south from
Judea) with their riches, fancying, as it is common with people in a
fright, that they were safer any where than where they were. Or they
sent their riches thither as bribes to Pharaoh's courtiers, to engage
them in their interests, or as pay for their army. God would have helped
them gratis; but, if they will have help from the Egyptians, they must
pay dearly for it, and they seem willing to do so. The riches that are
so spent will turn to a bad account. They carried their effects to Egypt
through a land (so it may be read) of trouble and anguish, that vast
howling wilderness which lay between Canaan and Egypt, whence come the
lion and fiery serpent, [Deu 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015.md).
They would venture through that dangerous wilderness, to bring what they
had to Egypt. Or it may be meant of Egypt itself, which had been to
Israel a house of bondage and therefore a land of trouble and anguish,
and which abounded in ravenous and venomous creatures. See what dangers
men run into that forsake God, and what dangers they will run into in
pursuance of their carnal confidences and their expectations from the
creature.

III\. What would be the consequence of it. 1. The Egyptians would
receive their ambassadors, would address them very respectfully, and be
willing to treat with them ([Isa
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#004).md): His princes were at Zoan, at
Pharaoh's court there, and had their audience of the king, who
encouraged them to depend upon his friendship and the succours he would
send them. But, 2. They would not answer their expectation: They could
not profit them, [Isa 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#005.md). For God
says, They shall not profit them ([Isa
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006).md), and every creature is that to
us (and no more) which he makes it to be. The forces they were to
furnish them with could not be raised in time; or, when they were
raised, they were not fit for service, and they would not venture any of
their veteran troops in the expedition; or the march was so long that
they could not come up when they had occasion for them; or the Egyptians
would not be cordial to Israel, but would secretly incline to the
Assyrians, upon some account or other: The Egyptians shall help in vain,
and to no purpose, [Isa 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#007.md). They
shall hinder and hurt, instead of helping. And therefore, 3. These
people, that were now so fond of the Egyptians, would at length be
ashamed of them, and of all their expectations from them and confidence
in them ([Isa 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#003).md): "The strength of
Pharaoh, which was your pride, shall be your shame; all your neighbours
will upbraid you, and you will upbraid yourselves, with your folly in
trusting to it. And the shadow of Egypt, that land shadowing with wings
([Isa 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001).md), which was your
confidence, shall be your confusion; it will not only disappoint you,
and be the matter of your shame, but it will weaken all your other
supports, and be an occasion of mischief to you." God afterwards
threatens the ruin of Egypt for this very thing, because they had dealt
treacherously with Israel and been a staff of a reed to them, [Eze
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#006.md), [Eze
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#007.md). The princes and ambassadors of
Israel, who were so forward to court an alliance with them, when they
come among them shall see so much of their weakness, or rather of their
baseness, that they shall all be ashamed of a people that could not be a
help or profit to them, but a shame and reproach, [Isa
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#005.md). Those that trust in God, in his
power, providence, and promise, are never made ashamed of their hope;
but those that put confidence in any creature will sooner or later find
it a reproach to them. God is true, and may be trusted, but every man a
liar, and must be suspected. The Creator is a rock of ages, the creature
a broken reed. We cannot expect too little from man nor too much from
God.

IV\. The use and application of all this ([Isa
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#007).md): "Therefore have I cried
concerning this matter, this project of theirs. I have published it,
that all might take notice of it. I have pressed it as one in earnest.
Their strength is to sit still, in a humble dependence upon God and his
goodness and a quiet submission to his will, and not to wander about and
put themselves to great trouble to seek help from this and the other
creature." If we sit still in a day of distress, hoping and quietly
waiting for the salvation of the Lord, and using only lawful regular
methods for our own preservation, this will be the strength of our souls
both for services and sufferings, and it will engage divine strength for
us. We weaken ourselves, and provoke God to withdraw from us, when we
make flesh our arm, for then our hearts depart from the Lord. When we
have tired ourselves by seeking for help from creatures we shall find it
the best way of recruiting ourselves to repose in the Creator. Here I
am, let him do with me as he pleases.

[Isaiah 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 30:8</span></span>

Here, I. The preface is very awful. The prophet must not only preach
this, but he must write it ([Isa
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#008).md), write it in a table, to be hung
up and exposed to public view; he must carefully note it, not in loose
papers which might be lost or torn, but in a book, to be preserved for
posterity, in perpetuam rei memoriam - for a standing testimony against
this wicked generation; let it remain not only to the next succeeding
ages, but for ever and ever, while the world stands; and so it shall,
for the book of the scriptures no doubt, shall continue, and be read, to
the end of time. Let it be written, 1. To shame the men of the present
age, who would not hear and heed it when it was spoken. Let it be
written, that it may not be lost; their children may profit by it,
though they will not. 2. To justify God in the judgments he was about to
ring upon them; people will be tempted to think he was too hard upon
them, and over-severe, unless they know how very bad they were, how very
provoking, and what fair means God tried with them before he brought it
to this extremity. 3. For warning to others not to do as they did, lest
they should fare as they fared. It is designed for admonition to those
of the remotest place and age, even those upon whom the ends of the
world have come, [Co1 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011.md). It may be
of use for God's ministers not only to preach, but to write; for that
which is written remains.

II\. The character given of the profane and wicked Jews is very sad. He
must, if he will draw them in their own colours, write this concerning
them (and we are sure he does not bear false witness against them, nor
make them worse than they were, for the judgment of God is according to
truth), That this is a rebellious people, [Isa
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#009.md). The Jews were, for aught we
know, the only professing people God had then in the world, and yet many
of them were a rebellious people. 1. They rebelled against their own
convictions and covenants: "They are lying children, that will not stand
to what they say, that promise fair, but perform nothing;" when he took
them into covenant with himself he said of them, Surely they are my
people, children that will not lie ([Isa
63:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#008).md); but they proved otherwise. 2.
They rebelled against the divine authority: "They are children that will
not hear the law of the Lord, nor heed it, but will do as they have a
mind, let God himself say what he will to the contrary."

III\. The charge drawn up against them is very high and the sentence
passed upon them very dreadful. Two things they here stand charged with,
and their doom is read for both, a fearful doom: -

1\. They forbade the prophets to speak to them in God's name, and to
deal faithfully with them.

(1.) This their sin is described, [Isa
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#010.md), [Isa
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#011.md). They set themselves so
violently against the prophets to hinder them from preaching, or at
least from dealing plainly with them in their preaching, did so banter
them and browbeat them, that they did in effect say to the seers, See
not. They had the light, but they loved darkness rather. It was their
privilege that they had seers among them, but they did what they could
to put out their eyes - that they had prophets among them, but they did
what they could to stop their mouths; for they tormented them in their
wicked ways, [Rev 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#010.md). Those that
silence good ministers, and discountenance good preaching, are justly
counted, and called, rebels against God. See what it was in the
prophets' preaching with which they found themselves aggrieved. \[1.\]
The prophets told them of their faults, and warned them of their misery
and danger by reason of sin, and they could not bear that. They must
speak to them smooth things, must flatter them in their sins, and say
that they did well, and there was no harm, no peril, in the course of
life they lived in. Let a thing be ever so right and true, if it be not
smooth, they will not hear it. But if it be agreeable to the good
opinion they have of themselves, and will confirm them in that, though
it be ever so false and ever so great a cheat upon them, they will have
it prophesied to them. Those deserve to be deceived that desire to be
so. \[2.\] The prophets stopped them in their sinful pursuits, and stood
in their way like the angel in Balaam's road, with the sword of God's
wrath drawn in their hand; so that they could not proceed without
terror. And this they took as a great insult. When they went on
frowardly in the way of their hearts they said to the prophets, "Get you
out of the way, turn aside out of the paths. What do you do in our way?
Cannot you let us alone to do as we please?" Those have their hearts
fully set in them to do evil that bid their faithful monitors to stand
out of their way. Forbear, why shouldst thou be smitten? [Ch2
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#016.md). \[3.\] The prophets were
continually telling them of the Holy One of Israel, what an enemy he is
to sin ad how severely he will reckon with sinners; and this they could
not endure to hear of. Both the thing itself and the expression of it
were too serious for them; and therefore, if the prophets will speak to
them, they will make it their bargain that they shall not call God the
Holy One of Israel; for God's holiness is that attribute which wicked
people most of all dread. Let us no more be troubled with that
state-preface (as Mr. White calls it) to your impertinent harangues.
Those have reason to fear perishing in their sins that cannot bear to be
frightened out of them.

(2.) Now what is the doom passed upon them for this? We have it, [Isa
30:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#012.md), [Isa
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#013.md). Observe, \[1.\] Who it is that
gives judgment upon them: Thus saith the Holy One of Israel. That title
of God which they particularly excepted against the prophet makes use
of. Faithful ministers will not be driven from using such expressions as
are proper to awaken sinners, though they be displeasing. We must tell
men that God is the Holy One of Israel, and so they shall find him,
whether they will hear or whether they will forbear. \[2.\] What the
ground of the judgment is: Because they despise this word - wither, in
general, every word that the prophets said to them, or this word in
particular, which declares God to be the Holy One of Israel: "they
despise this, and will neither make it their fear, to stand in awe of
it, nor make it their hope, to put any confidence in it; but, rather
than they will be beholden to the Holy One of Israel, they will trust in
oppression and perverseness, in the wealth they have got and the
interest they have made by fraud and violence, or in the sinful methods
they have taken for their own security, in contradiction to God and his
will. On these they lean, and therefore it is just that they should
fall." \[3.\] What the judgment is that is passed upon them: "This
iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall. This confidence of
yours will be like a house built upon the sand, which will fall in the
storm and bury the builder in the ruins of it. Your contempt of that
word of God which you might build upon will make every thing else you
trust like a wall that bulges out, which, if any weight be laid upon it,
comes down, nay, which often sinks with its own weight." The ruin they
would hereby bring upon themselves should be, First, A surprising ruin:
The breaking shall come suddenly, at an instant, when they do not expect
it, which will make it the more frightful, and when they are not
prepared or provided for it, which will make it the more fatal.
Secondly, An utter ruin, universal and irreparable: "Your and all your
confidences shall be not only weak as the potter's clay ([Isa
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#016).md), but broken to pieces as the
potter's vessel. He that has the rod of iron shall break it ([Psa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009).md) and he shall not spare, shall not
have any regard to it, nor be in care to preserve or keep whole any part
of it. But, when once it is broken so as to be unfit for use, let it be
dashed, let it be crushed, all to pieces, so that there may not remain
one sherd big enough to take up a little fire or water" - two things we
have daily need of, and which poor people commonly fetch in a piece of a
broken pitcher. They shall not only be as a bowing wall ([Psa
62:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#003).md), but as a broken mug or glass,
which is good for nothing, nor can ever be made whole again.

2\. They slighted the gracious directions God gave them, not only how to
secure themselves and make themselves safe, but how to compose
themselves and make themselves easy; they would take their own way, [Isa
30:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#015.md). Observe here,

(1.) The method God put them into for salvation and strength. The God
that knew them, and knew what was proper for them, and desired their
welfare, gave them this prescription; and it is recommended to us all.
\[1.\] Would we be saved from the evil of every calamity, guarded
against the temptation of it and secured from the curse of it, which are
the only evil things in it? It must be in returning and rest, in
returning to God and reposing in him as our rest. Let us return from our
evil ways, into which we have gone aside, and rest and settle in the way
of God and duty, and that is the way to be saved. "Return from this
project of going down to Egypt, and rest satisfied in the will of God,
and then you may trust him with your safety. In returning (in the
thorough reformation of your hearts and lives) and in rest (in an entire
submission of your souls to God and a complacency in him) you shall be
saved." \[2.\] Would we be strengthened to do what is required of us and
to bear what is laid upon us? It must be in quietness and in confidence;
we must keep our spirits calm and sedate by a continual dependence upon
God, and his power and goodness; we must retire into ourselves with a
holy quietness, suppressing all turbulent and tumultuous passions, and
keeping the peace in our own minds. And we must rely upon God with a
holy confidence that he can do what he will and will do what is best for
his people. And this will be our strength; it will inspire us with such
a holy fortitude as will carry us with ease and courage through all the
difficulties we may meet with.

(2.) The contempt they put upon this prescription; they would not take
God's counsel, though it was so much for their own good. And justly will
those die of their disease that will not take God for their physician.
We are certainly enemies to ourselves if we will not be subjects to him.
They would not so much as try the method prescribed: "But you said, No
([Isa 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#016).md), we will not compose
ourselves, for we will flee upon horses and we will ride upon the swift;
we will hurry hither and thither to fetch in foreign aids." They think
themselves wiser than God, and that they know what is good for
themselves better than he does. When Sennacherib took all the fenced
cities of Judah, those rebellious children would not be persuaded to sit
still and patiently to expect God's appearing for them, as he did
wonderfully at last; but they would shift for their own safety, and
thereby they exposed themselves to so much the more danger.

(3.) The sentence passed upon them for this. Their sin shall be their
punishment: "You will flee, and therefore you shall flee; you will be
upon the full speed, and therefore so shall those be that pursue you."
The dogs are most apt to run barking after him that rides fast. The
conquerors protected those that sat still, but pursued those that made
their escape; and so that very project by which they hoped to save
themselves was justly their ruin and the most guilty suffered most. It
is foretold, [Isa 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#017.md), \[1.\] That
they should be easily cut off; they should be so dispirited with their
own fears, increased by their flight, that one of the enemy should
defeat a thousand of them, and five put an army to flight, which could
never be unless their Rock had sold them [Deu
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030.md). \[2.\] That they should be
generally cut off, and only here and there one should escape alone in a
solitary place, and be left for a spectacle too, as a beacon upon the
top of a mountain, a warning to others to avoid the like sinful courses
and carnal confidences.

[Isaiah 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 30:18</span></span>

The closing words of the foregoing paragraph (You shall be left as a
beacon upon a mountain) some understand as a promise that a remnant of
them should be reserved as monuments of mercy; and here the prophet
tells them what good times should succeed these calamities. Or the first
words in this paragraph may be read by way of antithesis,
Notwithstanding this, yet will the Lord wait that he may be gracious.
The prophet, having shown that those who made Egypt their confidence
would be ashamed of it, here shows that those who sat still and made God
alone their confidence would have the comfort of it. It is matter of
comfort to the people of God, when the times are very bad, that all will
be well yet, well with those that fear God, when we say to the wicked,
It shall be ill with you.

I. God will be gracious to them and will have mercy on them. This is the
foundation of all good. If we find favour with God, and he have mercy
upon us, we shall have comfort according to the time that we have been
afflicted.

1\. The mercy in store for them is very affectingly expressed. (1.) "He
will wait to be gracious ([Isa 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#018).md);
he will wait till you return to him and seek his face, and then he will
be ready to meet you with mercy. He will wait, that he may do it in the
best and fittest time, when it will be most for his glory, when it will
come to you with the most pleasing surprise. He will continually follow
you with his favours, and not let slip any opportunity of being gracious
to you." (2.) "He will stir up himself to deliver you, will be exalted,
will be raised up out of his holy habitation ([Zac
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#013).md), that he may appear for you in
more than ordinary instances of power and goodness; and thus he will be
exalted, that is, he will glorify his own name. This is what he aims at
in having mercy on his people." (3.) He will be very gracious ([Isa
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#019).md), and this in answer to prayer,
which makes his kindness doubly kind: "He will be gracious to thee, at
the voice of thy cry, the cry of thy necessity, when that is most urgent
- the cry of thy prayer, when that is most fervent. When he shall hear
it, there needs no more; at the first word he will answer thee, and say,
Here I am." Herein he is very gracious indeed. In particular, \[1.\]
Those who were disturbed in the possession of their estates shall again
enjoy them quietly. When the danger is over the people shall dwell in
Zion, at Jerusalem, as they used to do; they shall dwell safely, free
from the fear of evil. \[2.\] Those who were all in tears shall have
cause to rejoice, and shall weep no more; and those who dwell in Zion,
the holy city, will find enough there to wipe away tears from their
eyes.

2\. This is grounded upon two great truths: (1.) That the Lord is a God
of judgment; he is both wise and just in all the disposals of his
providence, true to his word and tender of his people. If he correct his
children, it is with judgment ([Jer
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#024).md), with moderation and
discretion, considering their frame. We think we may safely refer
ourselves to a man of judgment; and shall we not commit our way to a God
of judgment? (2.) That therefore all those are blessed who wait for him,
who not only wait on him with their prayers, but wait for him with their
hopes, who will not take any indirect course to extricate themselves out
of their straits, or anticipate their deliverance, but patiently expect
God's appearances for them in his own way and time. Because God is
infinitely wise, those are truly happy who refer their cause to him.

II\. They shall not again know the want of the means of grace, [Isa
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#020.md), [Isa
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#021.md). Here, 1. It is supposed that
they might be brought into straits and troubles after this deliverance
was wrought for them. It was promised ([Isa
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#019).md), that they should weep no more
and that God would be gracious to them; and yet here it is taken for
granted that God may give them the bread of adversity and the water of
affliction, prisoners' fare ([Kg1
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#027).md), coarse and sorry food, such as
the poor use. When one trouble is over we know not how soon another may
succeed; and we may have an interest in the favour of God, and such
consolations as are sufficient to prohibit weeping, and yet may have
bread of adversity given us to eat and water of affliction to drink. Let
us therefore not judge of love or hatred by what is before us. 2. It is
promised that their eyes should see their teachers, that is, that they
should have faithful teachers among them, and should have hearts to
regard them and not slight them as they had done; and then they might
the better be reconciled to the bread of adversity and the water of
affliction. It was a common saying among the old Puritans, Brown bread
and the gospel are good fare. A famine of bread is not so great a
judgment as a famine of the word of God, [Amo
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#011.md), [Amo
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#012.md). It seems that their teachers had
been removed into corners (probably being forced to shift for their
safety in the reign of Ahaz), but it shall be so no more. Veritas non
quaerit angulos - Truth seeks no corners for concealment. But the
teachers of truth may sometimes be driven into corners for shelter; and
it goes ill with the church when it is so, when the woman with her crown
of twelve stars is forced to flee into the wilderness ([Rev
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#006).md), when the prophets are hidden by
fifty in a cave, [Kg1 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#004.md). But God
will find a time to call the teachers out of their corners again, and to
replace them in their solemn assemblies, which shall see their own
teachers, the eyes of all the synagogue being fastened on them, [Luk
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#020.md). And it will be the more pleasing
because of the restraint they have been for some time under, as light
out of darkness, as life from the dead. To all that love God and their
own souls this return of faithful teachers out of their corners,
especially with a promise that they shall not be removed into corners
any more, is the most acceptable part of any deliverance, and has
comfort enough in it to sweeten even the bread of adversity and the
water of affliction. But this is not all: 3. It is promised that they
shall have the benefit, not only of the public ministry, but of private
and particular admonition and advice ([Isa
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#021).md): "Thy ears shall hear a word
behind thee, calling after thee as a man calls after a traveller that he
sees going out of his road." Observe, (1.) Whence this word shall come -
from behind thee, from some one whom thou dost not see, but who sees
thee. "Thy eyes see thy teachers; but this is a teacher out of sight, it
is thy own conscience, which shall now by the grace of God be awakened
to do its office." (2.) What the word shall be: "This is the way, walk
you in it. When thou art doubting, conscience shall direct thee to the
way of duty; when thou art dull and trifling, conscience shall quicken
thee in that way." As God has not left himself without witness, so he
has not left us without guides to show us our way. (3.) The
seasonableness of this word: It shall come when you turn to the right
hand or to the left. We are very apt to miss our way; there are turnings
on both hands, and those so tracked and seemingly straight that they may
easily be mistaken for the right way. There are right-hand and left-hand
errors, extremes on each side virtue; the tempter is busy courting us
into the by-paths. It is happy then if by the particular counsels of a
faithful minister or friend, or the checks of conscience and the
strivings of God's Spirit, we be set right and prevented from going
wrong. (4.) The success of this word: "It shall not only be spoken, but
thy ears shall hear it; whereas God has formerly spoken once, yea,
twice, and thou hast not perceived it ([Job
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#014).md), now thou shalt listen
attentively to these secret whispers, and hear them with an obedient
ear." If God gives us not only the word, but the hearing ear, not only
the means of grace, but a heart to make a good use of those means, we
have reason to say, He is very gracious to us, and reason to hope he has
yet further mercy in store for us.

III\. They shall be cured of their idolatry, shall fall out with their
idols, and never be reconciled to them again, [Isa
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#022.md). The deliverance God shall work
for them shall convince them that it is their interest, as well as duty,
to serve him only; and they shall own that, as their trouble was brought
upon them for their idolatries, so it was removed upon condition that
they should not return to them. This is also the good effect of their
seeing their teachers and hearing the word behind them; by this it shall
appear that they are the better for the means of grace they enjoy - they
shall break off from their best-beloved sin. Observe, 1. How foolishly
mad they had formerly been upon their idols, in the day of their
apostasy. Idolaters are said to be mad upon their idols ([Jer
50:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#038).md), doatingly fond of them. They
had graven images of silver, and molten images of gold, and, though gold
needs no painting, they had coverings and ornaments on these; they
spared no cost in doing honour to their idols. 2. How wisely mad (if I
may so speak) they now were at their idols, what a holy indignation they
conceived against them in the day of their repentance. They not only
degraded their images, but defaced them, not only defaced them, but
defiled them; they not only spoiled the shape of them, but in a pious
fury threw away the gold and silver they were made of, though otherwise
valuable and convertible to a good use. They could not find in their
hearts to make any vessel of honour of them. The rich clothes wherewith
their images were dressed up they cast away as a filthy cloth which
rendered those that touched it unclean until the evening, [Lev
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#023.md). Note, To all true penitents sin
has become very odious; they loathe it, and loathe themselves because of
it; they cast it away to the dunghill, the fittest place for it, nay, to
the cross, for they crucify the flesh; their cry against it is, Crucify
it, crucify it. They say unto it, Abi hinc in malam rem - Get thee
hence. They are resolved never to harbour it any more. They put as far
from as they can all the occasions of sin and temptations to it, though
they are as a right eye or a right hand, and protest against it as
Ephraim did ([Hos 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#008).md), What have I
to do any more with idols? Probably this was fulfilled in many
particular persons, who, by the deliverance of Jerusalem from
Sennacherib's army, were convinced of the folly of their idolatry and
forsook it. It was fulfilled in the body of the Jewish nation at their
return from their captivity in Babylon, for they abhorred idols ever
after; and it is accomplished daily in the conversion of souls, by the
power of divine grace, from spiritual idolatry to the fear and love of
God. Those that join themselves to the Lord must abandon every sin, and
say unto it, Get thee hence.

IV\. God will then give them plenty of all good things. When he gives
them their teachers, and they give him their hearts, so that they begin
to seek the kingdom of God and the righteousness thereof, then all other
things shall be added to them [Mat
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033.md). And when the people are brought
to praise God then shall the earth yield her increase, and with it God,
even our own God, shall bless us, [Psa
67:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#005.md), [Psa
67:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#006.md). So it follows here: "When you
shall have abandoned your idols, then shall God give the rain of your
seed," [Isa 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#023.md). When we return to
God in a way of duty he will meet us with his favours. 1. God will give
you rain of your seed, rain to water the seed you sow, just at the time
that it calls for it, as much as it needs and no more. Observe, How
man's industry and God's blessing concur to the good things we enjoy
relating to the life that now is: Thou shalt sow the ground, that is thy
part, and then God will give the rain of thy seed, that is his part. It
is so in spiritual fruit; we must take pains with our hearts and then
wait on God for his grace. 2. The increase of the earth shall be rich
and good, and every thing the best of the kind; it shall be fat and fat,
very fat and very good, fat and plenteous (so we read it), good and
enough of it. Your land shall be Canaan indeed; it was remarkably so
after the defeat of Sennacherib, by the special blessing of God, [Isa
37:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#030.md). God would thus repair the
losses they sustained by that devastation. 3. Not only the tillage, but
the pasture-ground should be remarkably fruitful: The cattle shall feed
in large pastures; those that are at grass shall have room enough, and
the oxen and asses that are kept up for use, to ear the ground, which
must be the better fed for their being worked, shall eat clean
provender. The corn shall not be given them in the chaff as usual, to
make it go the further, but they shall have good clean corn fit for
man's use, being winnowed with the fan. The brute-creatures shall share
in the abundance; it is fit they should, for they groan under the burden
of the curse which man's sin has brought upon the earth. 4. Even the
tops of the mountains, that used to be barren, shall be so well watered
with the rain of heaven that there shall be rivers and streams there,
and running down thence to the valleys ([Isa
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#025).md), and this in the day of the
great slaughter that should be made by the angel in the camp of the
Assyrians, when the towers and batteries they had erected for the
carrying on of the siege of Jerusalem, the army being slain, should fall
of course. It is probable that this was fulfilled in the letter of it,
and that about the same time that that army was cut off there were
extraordinary rains in mercy to the land.

V. The effect of all this should be extraordinary comfort and joy to the
people of God, [Isa 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#026.md). Light shall
increase; that is, knowledge shall increase (when the prophecies are
accomplished they shall be fully understood) or rather triumph shall:
the light of the joy that is sown for the righteous shall now come up
with a great increase. The light of the moon shall become as bright and
as strong as that of the sun, and that of the sun shall increase
proportionably and be as the light of seven days; every one shall be
much more cheerful and appear much more pleasant than usual. There shall
be a high spring-tide of joy in Judah and Jerusalem, upon occasion of
the ruin of the Assyrian army, when the Lord binds up the breach of his
people, not only saves them from being further wounded, but heals the
wounds that have been given them by this invasion and makes up all their
losses. The great distress they were reduced to, their despair of
relief, and the suddenness of their deliverance, would much augment
their joy. This is not unfitly applied by many to the light which the
gospel brought into the world to those that sat in darkness, which has
far exceeded the Old Testament light as that of the sun does that of the
moon, and which proclaims healing to the broken-hearted, and the binding
up of their wounds.

[Isaiah 30:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 30:27</span></span>

This terrible prediction of the ruin of the Assyrian army, though it is
a threatening to them, is part of the promise to the Israel of God, that
God would not only punish the Assyrians for the mischief they had done
to the Israel of God, but would disable and deter them from doing the
like again; and this prediction, which would now shortly be
accomplished, would ratify and confirm the foregoing promises, which
should be accomplished in the latter days. Here is,

I. God Almighty angry, and coming forth in anger against the Assyrians.
He is here introduced in all the power and all the terror of his wrath,
[Isa 30:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#027.md). The name of Jehovah, which
the Assyrians disdain and set at a distance from them, as if they were
out of its reach and it could do them no harm, behold, it comes from
far. A messenger in the name of the Lord comes from as far off as heaven
itself. He is a messenger of wrath, burning with his anger. God's lips
are full of indignation at the blasphemy of Rabshakeh, who compared the
God of Israel with the gods of the heathen; his tongue is as a devouring
fire, for he can speak his proud enemies to ruin; his very breath comes
with as much force as an overflowing stream, and with it he shall slay
the wicked, [Isa 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004.md). He does not
stifle or smother his resentments, as men do theirs when they are either
causeless or impotent; but he shall cause his glorious voice to be heard
when he proclaims war with an enemy that sets him at defiance, [Isa
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030.md). He shall display the
indignation of his anger, anger in the highest degree; it shall be as
the flame of a devouring fire, which carries and consumes all before it,
with lightning or dissipation, and with tempest and hailstones, all
which are the formidable phenomena of nature, and therefore expressive
of the terror of the Almighty God of nature.

II\. The execution done by this anger of the Lord. Men are often angry
when they can only threaten and talk big; but when God causes his
glorious voice to be heard that shall not be all: he will show the
lighting down of his arm too, [Isa
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030.md). The operations of his
providence shall accomplish the menaces of his word. Those that would
not see the lifting up of his arm ([Isa
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#011).md) shall feel the lighting down of
it, and find, to their cost, that the burden thereof is heavy ([Isa
30:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#027).md), so heavy that they cannot bear
it, nor bear up against it, but must unavoidably sink and be crushed
under it. Who knows the power of his anger or imagines what an offended
God can do? Five things are here prepared for the execution: - 1. Here
is an overflowing stream, that shall reach to the midst of the neck,
shall quite overwhelm the whole body of the army, and Sennacherib only,
the head of it, shall keep above water and escape this stroke, while yet
he is reserved for another in the house of Nisroch his god. The Assyrian
army had been to Judah as an overflowing stream, reaching even to the
neck ([Isa 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007.md), [Isa
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008).md), and now the breath of God's
wrath will be so to it. 2. Here is a sieve of vanity, with which God
would sift those nations of which the Assyrian army was composed, [Isa
30:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#028.md). The great God can sift nations,
for they are all before him as the small dust of the balance; he will
sift them, not to gather out of them any that should be preserved, but
so as to shake them one against another, put them into great
consternation, and shake them all away at last; for it is a sieve of
vanity (which retains nothing) that they are shaken with, and they are
found all chaff. 3. Here is a bridle, which God has in their jaws, to
curb and restrain them from doing the mischief they would do, and to
force and constrain them to serve his purposes against their own will,
[Isa 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#007.md). God particularly says of
Sennacherib ([Isa 37:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#029).md) that he will
put a hook in his nose and a bridle in his lips. It is a bridle causing
them to err, forcing them to such methods as will certainly be
destructive to themselves and their interest and in which they will be
infatuated. God with a word guides his people into the right way ([Isa
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#021).md), but with a bridle he turns his
enemies headlong upon their own ruin. 4. Here is a rod and a staff, even
the voice of the Lord, his word giving orders concerning it, with which
the Assyrian shall be beaten down, [Isa
30:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#031.md). The Assyrian had been himself a
rod in God's hand for the chastising of his people, and had smitten
them, [Isa 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md). That was a transient
rod; but against the Assyrian shall go forth a grounded staff, that
shall give a steady blow, shall stick close to him and strike home, so
as to leave an impression upon him. It is a staff with a foundation,
founded upon the enemies' deserts and God's determinate counsel. It is a
consumption determined ([Isa 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#023).md),
and therefore there is no escaping it, no getting out of the reach of
it; it shall pass in every place where an Assyrian is found, and the
Lord shall lay it upon him, and cause it to rest, [Isa
30:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#032.md). Such is the woeful case of
those that persist in enmity to God: the wrath of God abides on them. 5.
Here is Tophet ordained and prepared for them, [Isa
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033.md). The valley of the son of
Hinnom, adjoining to Jerusalem, was called Tophet. In that valley, it is
supposed, many of the Assyrian regiments lay encamped, and were there
slain by the destroying angel; or there the bodies of those that were so
slain were burned. Hezekiah had lately, and from yesterday (so the word
is) ordained it; that is, say some, he had cleared it of the images that
were set up in it, to which they there burnt their children, and so
prepared it to be a receptacle for the dead bodies of their enemies, for
the king of Assyria (that is, for his army) it is prepared, and there is
fuel enough ready to burn them all; and they shall be consumed as
suddenly and effectually as if the fire were kept burning by a continual
stream of brimstone, for such the breath of the Lord, his word and his
wrath, will be to it. Now as the prophet, in the foregoing promises,
slides insensibly into the promises of gospel graces and comforts, so
here, in the threatening of the ruin of Sennacherib's army, he points at
the final and everlasting destruction of all impenitent sinners. Our
Saviour calls the future misery of the damned Gehenna, in allusion to
the valley of Hinnom, which gives some countenance to the applying of
this to that misery, as also that in the Apocalypse it is so often
called the lake that burns with fire and brimstone. This is said to be
prepared of old for the devil and his angels, for the greatest of
sinners, the proudest, and that think themselves not accountable to any
for what they say and do; even for kings it is prepared. It is deep and
large, sufficient to receive the world of the ungodly; the pile thereof
is fire and much wood. God's wrath is the fire, and sinners make
themselves fuel to it; and the breath of the Lord (the power of his
anger) kindles it, and will keep it ever burning. See [Isa
66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024.md). Wherefore stand in awe and sin
not.

III\. The great joy which this should occasion to the people of God. The
Assyrian's fall is Jerusalem's triumph ([Isa
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#029).md): You shall have a song as in
the night, a psalm of praise such as those sing who by night stand in
the house of the Lord, and sing to his glory who gives songs in the
night. It shall not be a song of vain mirth, but a sacred song, such as
was sung when a holy solemnity was kept in a grave and religious manner.
Our joy in the fall of the church's enemies must be a holy joy, gladness
of heart, as when one goes, with a pipe (such as the sons of the
prophets used when they prophesied, [Sa1
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#005).md), to the mountain of the Lord,
there to celebrate the praises of the Mighty One of Israel. Nay, in
every place where the divine vengeance shall pursue the Assyrians they
shall not only fall unlamented, but all their neighbours shall attend
their fall with tabrets and harps, pleased to see how God, in battles of
shaking, such as shake them out of the world, fights with them ([Isa
30:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#032).md); for when the wicked perish
there is shouting; and it is with a particular satisfaction that wise
and good men see the ruin of those who, like the Assyrians, have
insolently bidden defiance to God and trampled upon all mankind.
