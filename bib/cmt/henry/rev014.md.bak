### [Revelation Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001.md)

[Revelation](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rev 14:0</span></span>

After an account of the great trials and sufferings which the servants
of God had endured, we have now a more pleasant scene opening; the day
begins now to dawn, and here we have represented, I. The Lord Jesus at
the head of his faithful followers ([Rev
14:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001).md). II. Three angels sent
successively to proclaim the fall of Babylon and the things antecedent
and consequent to so great an event ([Rev
14:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006).md). III. The vision of the
harvest ([Rev 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#014), etc..md).

[Revelation 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 14:1</span></span>

Here we have one of the most pleasing sights that can be viewed in this
world - the Lord Jesus Christ at the head of his faithful adherents and
attendants. Here observe, 1. How Christ appears: as a Lamb standing upon
mount Zion. Mount Zion is the gospel church. Christ is with his church
and in the midst of her in all her troubles, and therefore she is not
consumed. It is his presence that secures her perseverance; he appears
as a Lamb, a true Lamb, the Lamb of God. A counterfeit lamb is mentioned
as rising out of the earth in the last chapter, which was really a
dragon; here Christ appears as the true paschal Lamb, to show that his
mediatorial government is the fruit of his sufferings, and the cause of
his people's safety and fidelity. 2. How his people appear: very
honourably. (1.) As to the numbers, they are many, even all who are
sealed; not one of them lost in all the tribulations through which they
have gone. (2.) Their distinguishing badge: they had the name of God
written in their foreheads; they made a bold and open profession of
their faith in God and Christ, and, this being followed by suitable
actings, they are known and approved. (3.) Their congratulations and
songs of praise, which were peculiar to the redeemed ([Rev
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#003).md); their praises were loud as
thunder, or as the voice of many waters; they were melodious, as of
harpers; they were heavenly, before the throne of God. The song was new,
suited to the new covenant, and unto that new and gracious dispensation
of Providence under which they now were; and their song was a secret to
others, strangers intermeddled not with their joy; others might repeat
the words of the song, but they were strangers to the true sense and
spirit of it. (4.) Their character and description. \[1.\] They are
described by their chastity and purity: They are virgins. They had not
defiled themselves either with corporal or spiritual adultery; they had
kept themselves clean from the abominations of the antichristian
generation. \[2.\] By their loyalty and stedfast adherence to Christ:
They follow the Lamb withersoever he goes; they follow the conduct of
his word, Spirit, and providence, leaving it to him to lead them into
what duties and difficulties he pleases. \[3.\] By their former
designation to this honour: These were redeemed from among men, being
the first-fruits to God, and to the Lamb, [Rev
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004.md). Here is plain evidence of a
special redemption: They were redeemed from among men. Some of the
children of men are, by redeeming mercy, distinguished from others: They
were the first-fruits to God, and to the Lamb, his choice ones, eminent
in every grace, and the earnest of many more who should be followers of
them, as they were of Christ. \[4.\] By their universal integrity and
conscientiousness: There was no guile found in them, and they were
without fault before the throne of God. They were without any prevailing
guile, any allowed fault; their hearts were right with God, and, as for
their human infirmities, they were freely pardoned in Christ. This is
the happy remnant who attend upon the Lord Jesus as their head and Lord;
he is glorified in them, and they are glorified in him.

[Revelation 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 14:6</span></span>

In this part of the chapter we have three angels or messengers sent from
heaven to give notice of the fall of Babylon, and of those things that
were antecedent and consequent to that great event.

I. The first angel was sent on an errand antecedent to it, and that was
to preach the everlasting gospel, [Rev
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006.md), [Rev
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#007.md). Observe, 1. The gospel is an
everlasting gospel; it is so in its nature, and it will be so in its
consequences. Though all flesh be grass, the word of the Lord endureth
for ever. 2. It is a work fit for an angel to preach this everlasting
gospel; such is the dignity, and such is the difficulty of that work!
And yet we have this treasure in earthen vessels. 3. The everlasting
gospel is of great concern to all the world; and, as it is the concern
of all, it is very much to be desired that it should be made known to
all, even to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people. 4. The
gospel is the great means whereby men are brought to fear God, and to
give glory to him. Natural religion is not sufficient to keep up the
fear of God, nor to secure to him glory from men; it is the gospel that
revives the fear of God, and retrieves his glory in the world. 5. When
idolatry creeps into the churches of God, it is by the preaching of the
gospel, attended by the power of the Holy Spirit, that men are turned
from idols to serve the living God, as the Creator of the heaven, and
the earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters, [Rev
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#007.md). To worship any God besides him
who created the world is idolatry.

II\. The second angel follows the other, and proclaims the actual fall
of Babylon. The preaching of the everlasting gospel had shaken the
foundations of antichristianism in the world, and hastened its downfall.
By Babylon is generally understood Rome, which was before called Sodom
and Egypt, for wickedness and cruelty, and is now first called Babylon,
for pride and idolatry. Observe, 1. What God has fore-ordained and
foretold shall be done as certainly as if it were done already. 2. The
greatness of the papal Babylon will not be able to prevent her fall, but
will make it more dreadful and remarkable. 3. The wickedness of Babylon,
in corrupting, debauching, and intoxicating the nations round about her,
will make her fall just and will declare the righteousness of God in her
utter ruin, [Rev 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#008.md). Her crimes are
recited as the just cause of her destruction.

III\. A third angel follows the other two, and gives warning to all of
that divine vengeance which would overtake all those that obstinately
adhered to the antichristian interest after God had thus proclaimed its
downfall, [Rev 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#009.md), [Rev
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#010.md). If after this (this threatening
denounced against Babylon, and in part already executed) any should
persist in their idolatry, professing subjection to the beast and
promoting his cause, they must expect to drink deep of the wind of the
wrath of God; they shall be for ever miserable in soul and body; Jesus
Christ will inflict this punishment upon them, and the holy angels will
behold it and approve of it. Idolatry, both pagan and papal, is a
damning sin in its own nature, and will prove fatal to those who persist
in it, after fair warning given by the word of Providence; those who
refuse to come out of Babylon, when thus called, and resolve to partake
of her sins, must receive of her plagues; and the guilt and ruin of such
incorrigible idolaters will serve to set forth the excellency of the
patience and obedience of the saints. These graces shall be rewarded
with salvation and glory. When the treachery and rebellion of others
shall be punished with everlasting destruction, then it will be said, to
the honour of the faithful ([Rev
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#012).md): Here is the patience of the
saints; you have before seen their patience exercised, now you see it
rewarded.

[Revelation 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 14:13</span></span>

Here we have the vision of the harvest and vintage, introduced with a
solemn preface. Observe,

I. The preface, [Rev 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013.md). Here note,
1. Whence this prophecy about the harvest came: it came down from
heaven, and not from men, and therefore it is of certain truth and great
authority. 2. How it was to be preserved and published - by writing; it
was to be a matter of record, that the people of God might have recourse
to it for their support and comfort upon all occasions. 3. What it
principally intended, and that is, to show the blessedness of all the
faithful saints and servants of God, both in death and after death:
Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord from henceforth, etc. Here
observe, (1.) The description of those that are and shall be blessed -
such as die in the Lord, either die in the cause of Christ, or rather
die in a state of vital union with Christ, such as are found in Christ
when death comes. (2.) The demonstration of this blessedness: They rest
from their labours, and their works do follow them. \[1.\] They are
blessed in their rest; they rest from all sin, temptation, sorrow, and
persecution. There the wicked cease from troubling, there the weary are
at rest. \[2.\] They are blessed in their recompence: Their works follow
them; they do not go before them as their title, or price of purchase,
but follow them as their evidence of having lived and died in the Lord;
and the memory of them will be pleasant, and the reward glorious, far
above the merit of all their services and sufferings. \[3.\] They are
happy in the time of their dying, when they have lived to see the cause
of God reviving, the peace of the church returning, and the wrath of God
falling upon their idolatrous cruel enemies. Such times are good times
to die in; they have Simeon's desire: Now, Lord, let thou thy servant
depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation. And all this is
ratified and confirmed by the testimony of the Spirit witnessing with
their spirits and with the written word.

II\. We have the vision itself, represented by a harvest and a vintage.

1\. By a harvest ([Rev 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#014.md), [Rev
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#015).md), an emblem that sometimes
signifies the cutting down of the wicked, when ripe for ruin, by the
judgments of God, and sometimes the gathering in of the righteous, when
ripe for heaven, by the mercy of God. This seems rather to represent
God's judgments against the wicked: and here observe,

(1.) The Lord of the harvest - one so like unto the Son of man that he
was the same, even the Lord Jesus, who is described, \[1.\] By the
chariot in which he sat - a white cloud, a cloud that had a bright side
turned to the church, how dark soever it might be to the wicked. \[2.\]
By the ensign of his power: On his head was a golden crown, authority to
do all that he did and whatsoever he would do. \[3.\] By the instrument
of his providences: In his hand a sharp sickle. \[4.\] By the
solicitations he had from the temple to perform this great work. What he
did, he was desired to do by his people; and, though he was resolved to
do it, he would for this thing be sought unto by them, and so it should
be in return to their prayers.

(2.) The harvest-work, which is, to thrust the sickle into the corn, and
reap the field. The sickle is the sword of God's justice; the field is
the world; reaping is cutting the inhabitants of the earth down and
carrying them off.

(3.) The harvest-time; and this is when the corn is ripe, when the
measure of the sin of men is filled up, and they are ripe for
destruction. The most inveterate enemies of Christ and his church are
not destroyed till by their sin they are ripe for ruin, and then he will
spare them no longer; he will thrust in his sickle, and the earth shall
be reaped.

2\. By a vintage, [Rev 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#017.md). Some
think that these two are only different emblems of the same judgment;
others that they refer to distinct events of providence before the end
of all things. Observe, (1.) To whom this vintage-work was committed -
to an angel, another angel that came out from the altar, that is, from
the holiest of all in heaven. (2.) At whose request this vintage-work
was undertaken: it was, as before, at the cry of an angel out of the
temple, the ministers and churches of God on earth. (3.) The work of the
vintage, which consists of two parts: - \[1.\] The cutting off, and
gathering, the clusters of the vine, which were now ripe and ready,
fully ripe, [Rev 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#018.md). \[2.\] Casting
these grapes into the wine-press ([Rev
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#019).md); here we are told, First, What
was the wine-press: it was the wrath of God, the fire of his
indignation, some terrible calamity, very probably the sword, shedding
the blood of the wicked. Secondly, Where was the place of the wine-press
- without the city, where the army lay that came against Babylon.
Thirdly, The quantity of the wine, that is, of the blood that was drawn
forth by this judgment: it was, for depth, up to the horses' bridles,
and, for breadth and length, a thousand and six hundred furlongs ([Rev
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#020).md); that is, say some, 200 Italian
miles, which is thought to be the measure of the holy land, and may be
meant of the patrimony of the holy see, encompassing the city of Rome.
But here we are left of doubtful conjectures. Perhaps this great event
has not yet had its accomplishment, but the vision is for an appointed
time; and therefore, though it may seem to tarry, we are to wait for it.
But who shall live when the Lord does this?
