### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001.md)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles)](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sol 2:0</span></span>

In this chapter, I. Christ speaks both concerning himself and concerning
his church ([Sol 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001.md), [Sol
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#002).md). II. The church speaks 1.
Remembering the pleasure and satisfaction she has in communion with
Christ ([Sol 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003.md), [Sol
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#004).md). 2. Entertaining herself with the
present tokens of his favour and taking care that nothing happen to
intercept them ([Sol 2:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#005).md). 3.
Triumphing in his approaches towards her ([Sol
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#008.md), [Sol
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009).md). 4. Repeating the gracious calls
he had given her to go along with him a walking, invited by the
pleasures of the returning spring ([Sol
2:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#010).md), out of her obscurity ([Sol
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014).md), and the charge he had given to
the servants to destroy that which would be hurtful to his vineyard
([Sol 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#015).md). 5. Rejoicing in her
interest in him ([Sol 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#016).md). 6.
Longing for his arrival ([Sol 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017).md).
Those whose hearts are filled with love to Christ, and hope of heaven,
know best what these things mean.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 2:1</span></span>

See here, I. What Christ is pleased to compare himself to; and he
condescends very much in the comparison. He that is the Son of the
Highest, the bright and morning star, calls and owns himself the rose of
Sharon, and the lily of the valleys, to express his presence with his
people in this world, the easiness of their access to him, and the
beauty and sweetness which they find in him, and to teach them to adorn
themselves with him, as shepherds and shepherdesses, when they appeared
gay, were decked with roses and lilies, garlands and chaplets of
flowers. The rose, for beauty and fragrance, is the chief of flowers,
and our Saviour prefers the clothing of the lily before that of Solomon
in all his glory. Christ is the rose of Sharon, where probably the best
roses grew and in most plenty, the rose of the field (so some), denoting
that the gospel salvation is a common salvation; it lies open to all;
whoever will may come and gather the rose-buds of privileges and
comforts that grow in the covenant of grace. He is not a rose locked up
in a garden, but all may come and receive benefit by him and comfort in
him. He is a lily for whiteness, a lily of the valleys for sweetness,
for those which we call so yield a strong perfume. He is a lily of the
valleys, or low places, in his humiliation, exposed to injury. Humble
souls see most beauty in him. Whatever he is to others, to those that
are in the valleys he is a lily. He is the rose, the lily; there is none
besides. Whatever excellence is in Christ, it is in him singularly and
in the highest degree.

II\. What he is pleased to compare his church to, [Sol
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#002.md). 1. She is as a lily; he himself
is the lily ([Sol 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001).md), she is as the
lily. The beauty of believers consists in their conformity and
resemblance to Jesus Christ. They are his love, and so they are as
lilies, for those are made like Christ in whose hearts his love is shed
abroad. 2. As a lily among thorns, as a lily compared with thorns. The
church of Christ as far excels all other societies as a bed of roses
excels a bush of thorns. As a lily compassed with thorns. The wicked,
the daughters of this world, such as have no love to Christ, are as
thorns, worthless and useless, good for nothing but to stop a gap; nay,
they are noxious and hurtful; they came in with sin and are a fruit of
the curse; they choke good seed, and hinder good fruit, and their end is
to be burned. God's people are as lilies among them, scratched and torn,
shaded and obscured, by them; they are dear to Christ, and yet exposed
to hardships and troubles in the world; they must expect it, for they
are planted among thorns ([Eze 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#006).md),
but they are nevertheless dear to him; he does not overlook nor
undervalue any of his lilies for their being among thorns, When they are
among thorns they must still be as lilies, must maintain their innocency
and purity, and, though they are among thorns, must not be turned into
thorns, must not render railing for railing, and, if they thus preserve
their character, they shall be still owned as conformable to Christ.
Grace in the soul is a lily among thorns; corruptions are thorns in the
flesh ([Co2 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007).md), are as Canaanites
to God's Israel ([Jos 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#013).md); but the
lily that is now among thorns shall shortly be transplanted out of this
wilderness into that paradise where there is no pricking brier nor
grieving thorn, [Eze 28:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#024.md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 2:3</span></span>

Here, I. The spouse commends her beloved and prefers him before all
others: As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, which perhaps
does not grow so high, nor spread so wide, as some other trees, yet is
useful and serviceable to man, yielding pleasant and profitable fruit,
while the other trees are of little use, no, not the cedars themselves,
till they are cut down, so is my beloved among the sons, so far does he
excel them all, - all the sons of God, the angels (that honour was put
upon him which was never designed for them, [Heb
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004).md), - all the sons of men; he is
fairer than them all, fairer than the choicest of them, [Psa
45:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#002.md). Name what creature you will, and
you will find Christ has the pre-eminence above them all. The world is a
barren tree to a soul; Christ is a fruitful one.

II\. She remembers the abundant comfort she has had in communion with
him: She sat down by him with great delight, as shepherds sometimes
repose themselves, sometimes converse with one another, under a tree. A
double advantage she found in sitting down so near the Lord Jesus: - 1.
A refreshing shade: I sat down under his shadow, to be sheltered by him
from the scorching heat of the sun, to be cooled, and so to take some
rest. Christ is to believers as the shadow of a great tree, nay, of a
great rock in a weary land, [Isa 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002.md);
[Isa 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#004.md). When a poor soul is parched
with convictions of sin and the terrors of the law, as David ([Psa
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004).md), when fatigued with the troubles
of this world, as Elijah when he sat down under a juniper tree ([Kg1
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#004).md), they find that in Christ, in
his name, his graces, his comforts, and his undertaking for poor
sinners, which revives them and keeps them from fainting; those that are
weary and heavily laden may find rest in Christ. It is not enough to
pass by this shadow, but we must sit down under it (here will I dwell,
for I have desired it); and we shall find it not like Jonah's gourd,
that soon withered, and left him in a heat, both inward and outward, but
like the tree of life, the leaves whereof were not only for shelter, but
for the healing of the nations. We must sit down under this shadow with
delight, must put an entire confidence in the protection of it (as [Jdg
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#015).md), and take an entire complacency
in the refreshment of it. But that is not all: 2. Here is pleasing
nourishing food. This tree drops its fruits to those that sit down under
its shadow, and they are welcome to them, and will find them sweet unto
their taste, whatever they are to others. Believers have tasted that the
Lord Jesus is gracious ([Pe1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#003).md); his
fruits are all the precious privileges of the new covenant, purchased by
his blood and communicated by his Spirit. Promises are sweet to a
believer, yea, and precepts too. I delight in the law of God after the
inward man. Pardons are sweet, and peace of conscience is sweet,
assurances of God's love, joys of the Holy Ghost, the hopes of eternal
life, and the present earnests and foretastes of it are sweet, all sweet
to those that have their spiritual senses exercised. If our mouths be
put out of taste for the pleasure of sin, divine consolations will be
sweet to our taste, sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.

III\. She owns herself obliged to Jesus Christ for all the benefit and
comfort she had in communion with him ([Sol
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#004).md): "I sat down under the
apple-tree, glad to be there, but he admitted me, nay, he pressed me, to
a more intimate communion with him: Come in, thou blessed of the Lord,
why standest thou without? He brought me to the house of wine, the place
where he entertains his special friends, from lower to higher measures
and degrees of comfort, from the fruit of the apple tree to the more
generous fruit of the vine." To him that values the divine joys he has
more shall be given. One of the rabbin by the banqueting-house
understands the tabernacle of the congregation, where the interpretation
of the law was given; surely we may apply it to Christian assemblies,
where the gospel is preached and gospel-ordinances are administered,
particularly the Lord's supper, that banquet of wine, especially to the
inside of those ordinances, communion with God in them. Observe, 1. How
she was introduced: "He brought me, wrought in me an inclination to draw
nigh to God, helped me over my discouragements, took me by the hand,
guided and led me, and gave me an access with boldness to God as a
Father," [Eph 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#018.md). We should never
have come into the banqueting-house, never have been acquainted with
spiritual pleasures, if Christ had not brought us, by opening for us a
new and living way and opening in us a new and living fountain. 2. How
she was entertained: His banner over me was love; he brought me in with
a banner displayed over my head, not as one he triumphed over, but as
one he triumphed in, and whom he always caused to triumph with him and
in him, [Co2 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#014.md). The gospel is
compared to a banner or ensign ([Isa
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012).md), and that which is represented
in the banner, written in it in letters of gold, letters of blood, is
love, love; and this is the entertainment in the banqueting-house.
Christ is the captain of our salvation, and he enlists all his soldiers
under the banner of love; in that they centre; to that they must
continually have an eye, and be animated by it. The love of Christ must
constrain them to fight manfully. When a city was taken the conqueror
set up his standard in it. "He has conquered me with his love, overcome
me with kindness, and that is the banner over me." This she speaks of as
what she had formerly had experience of, and she remembers it with
delight. Eaten bread must not be forgotten, but remembered with
thankfulness to that God who has fed us with manna in this wilderness.

IV\. She professes her strong affection and most passionate love to
Jesus Christ ([Sol 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#005).md): I am sick of
love, overcome, overpowered, by it. David explains this when he says
([Psa 119:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#020).md), My soul breaks for the
longing that it has unto thy judgments, and ([Psa
119:81](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#081).md), My soul faints for thy
salvation, languishing with care to make it sure and fear of coming
short of it. The spouse was now absent perhaps from her beloved, waiting
for his return, and cannot bear the grief of distance and delay. Oh how
much better it is with the soul when it is sick of love to Christ than
when it is surfeited with the love of this world! She cries out for
cordials: "Oh stay me with flagons, or ointments, or flowers, any thing
that is reviving; comfort me with apples, with the fruits of that
apple-tree, Christ ([Sol 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003).md), with
the merit and meditation of Christ and the sense of his love to my
soul." Note, Those that are sick of love to Christ shall not want
spiritual supports, while they are yet waiting for spiritual comforts.

V. She experiences the power and tenderness of divine grace, relieving
her in her present faintings, [Sol
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#006.md). Though he seemed to have
withdrawn, yet he was even then a very present help, 1. To sustain the
love-sick soul, and to keep it from fainting away: "His left hand is
under my head, to bear it up, nay, as a pillow to lay it easy." David
experienced God's hand upholding him then when his soul was following
hard after God ([Psa 63:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#008).md), and Job in
a state of desertion yet found that God put strength into him, [Job
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006.md). All his saints are in his hand,
which tenderly holds their aching heads. 2. To encourage the love-sick
soul to continue waiting till he returns: "For, in the mean time, his
right hand embraces me, and thereby gives me an unquestionable assurance
of his love." Believers owe all their strength and comfort to the
supporting left hand and embracing right hand of the Lord Jesus.

VI\. Finding her beloved thus nigh unto her she is in great care that
her communion with him be not interrupted ([Sol
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#007).md): I charge you, O you daughters of
Jerusalem. Jerusalem, the mother of us all, charges all her daughters,
the church charges all her members, the believing soul charges all its
powers and faculties, the spouse charges herself and all about her, not
to stir up, or awake, her love until he please, now that he is asleep in
her arms, as she was borne up in his, [Sol
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#006.md). She gives them this charge by the
roes and the hinds of the field, that is, by every thing that is amiable
in their eyes, and dear to them, as the loving hind and the pleasant
roe. "My love is to me dearer than those can be to you, and will be
disturbed, like them, with a very little noise." Note, 1. Those that
experience the sweetness of communion with Christ, and the sensible
manifestations of his love, cannot but desire the continuance of these
blessed views, these blessed visits. Pester would make tabernacles upon
the holy mount, [Mat 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#004.md). 2. Yet
Christ will, when he pleases, withdraw those extraordinary
communications of himself, for he is a free-agent, and the Spirit, as
the wind, blows where and when it listeth, and in his pleasure it
becomes us to acquiesce. But, 3. Our care must be that we do nothing to
provoke him to withdraw and to hide his face, that we carefully watch
over our own hearts and suppress every thought that may grieve his good
Spirit. Let those that have comfort be afraid of sinning it away.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 2:8</span></span>

The church is here pleasing herself exceedingly with the thoughts of her
further communion with Christ after she has recovered from her fainting
fit.

I. She rejoices in his approach, [Sol
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#008.md). 1. She hears him speak: "It is
the voice of my beloved, calling me to tell me he is coming." Like one
of his own sheep, she knows his voice before she sees him, and can
easily distinguish it from the voice of a stranger ([Joh
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#004.md), [Joh
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#005).md), and, like a faithful friend of
the bridegroom, she rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice,
[Joh 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#029.md). With what an air of triumph
and exultation does she cry out, "It is the voice of my beloved, it can
be the voice of no other, for none besides can speak to the heart and
make that burn." 2. She sees him come, sees the goings of our God, our
King, [Psa 48:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001.md) :24. Behold, he
comes. This may very well be applied to the prospect with the Old
Testament saints had of Christ's coming in the flesh. Abraham saw his
day at a distance, and was glad. The nearer the time came the clearer
discoveries were made of it; and those that waited for the consolation
of Israel with an eye of faith saw him come, and triumphed in the sight:
Behold, he comes; for they had heard him say ([Psa
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007).md), Lo, I come, to which their
faith here affixes its seal: Behold, he comes as he has promised. (1.)
He comes cheerfully and with great alacrity; he comes leaping and
skipping like a roe and like a young hart ([Sol
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009).md), as one pleased with his own
undertaking, and that had his heart upon it and his delights with the
sons of men. When he came to be baptized with the baptism of blood, how
was he straitened till it was accomplished! [Luk
12:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#050). (2..md) He comes slighting and
surmounting all the difficulties that lay in his way; he comes leaping
over the mountains, skipping over the hills (so some read it), making
nothing of the discouragements he was to break through; the curse of the
law, the death of the cross, must be undergone, all the powers of
darkness must be grappled with, but, before the resolutions of his love,
these great mountains become plains. Whatever opposition is given at any
time to the deliverance of God's church, Christ will break through it,
will get over it. (3.) He comes speedily, like a roe or a young hart;
they thought the time long (every day a year), but really he hastened;
as now, so then, surely he comes quickly; he that shall come will come,
and will not tarry. When he comes for the deliverance of his people he
flies upon a cloud, and never stays beyond his time, which is the best
time. We may apply it to particular believers, who find that even when
Christ has withdrawn sensible comforts, and seems to forsake, yet it is
but for a small moment, and he will soon return with everlasting
loving-kindness.

II\. She pleases herself with the glimpses she has of him, and the
glances she has of his favour: "He stands behind our wall; I know he is
there, for sometimes he looks forth at the window, or looks in at it,
and displays himself through the lattice." Such was the state of the Old
Testament church while it was in expectation of the coming of the
Messiah. The ceremonial law is called a wall of partition ([Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014).md), a veil ([Co2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#013).md); but Christ stood behind that
wall. They had him near them; they had him with them, though they could
not see him clearly. He that was the substance was not far off from the
shadows, [Col 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#017.md). The saw him
looking through the windows of the ceremonial institutions and smiling
through those lattices; in their sacrifices and purifications Christ
discovered himself to them, and gave them intimations and earnests of
his grace, both to engage and to encourage their longings for his
coming. Such is our present state in comparison with what it will be at
Christ's second coming. We now see him through a glass darkly (the body
is a wall between us and him, through the windows of which we now and
then get a sight of him), but not face to face, as we hope to see him
shortly. In the sacraments Christ is near us, but it is behind the wall
of external signs, through those lattices he manifests himself to us;
but we shall shortly see him as he is. Some understand this of the state
of a believer when he is under a cloud; Christ is out of sight and yet
not far off. See [Job 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#014.md), and
compare [Job 23:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#008.md). She calls the
wall that interposed between her and her beloved our wall, because it is
sin, and nothing else, that separates between us and God, and that is a
wall of our own erecting ([Isa 59:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001).md);
behind that he stands, as waiting to be gracious, and ready to be
reconciled, upon our repentance. Then he looks in at the window,
observes the frame of our hearts and the working of our souls; he looks
forth at the window, and shows himself in giving them some comfort, that
they may continue hoping for his return.

III\. She repeats the gracious invitation he had given her to come a
walking with him, [Sol 2:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#010.md). She
remembers what her beloved said to her, for it had made a very pleasing
and powerful impression upon her, and the word that quickens us we shall
never forget. She relates it for the encouragement of others, telling
them what he had said to her soul and done for her soul, [Psa
66:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#016.md).

1\. He called her his love and his fair one. Whatever she is to others,
to him she is acceptable, and in his eyes she is amiable. Those that
take Christ for their beloved, he will own as his; never was any love
lost that was bestowed upon Christ. Christ, by expressing his love to
believers, invites and encourages them to follow him.

2\. He called her to rise and come away, [Sol
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#010.md), and again [Sol
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#013.md). The repetition denotes
backwardness in her (we have need to be often called to come away with
Jesus Christ; precept must be upon precept and line upon line), but it
denotes earnestness in him; so much is his heart set upon the welfare of
precious souls that he importunes them most pressingly to that which is
for their own good.

3\. He gave for a reason the return of the spring, and the pleasantness
of the weather.

(1.) The season is elegantly described in a great variety of
expressions. \[1.\] The winter is past, the dark, cold, and barren
winter. Long winters and hard ones pass away at last; they do no endure
always. And the spring would not be so pleasant as it is if it did not
succeed the winter, which is a foil to its beauty, [Ecc
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#014.md). Neither the face of the heavens
nor that of the earth is always the same, but subject to continual
vicissitudes, diurnal and annual. The winter is past, but has not passed
away for ever; it will come again, and we must provide for it in summer,
[Pro 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#006.md), [Pro
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#008.md). We must weep in winter, and
rejoice in summer, as though we wept and rejoiced not, for both are
passing. \[2.\] The rain is over and gone, the winter-rain, the cold
stormy rain; it is over now, and the dew is as the dew of herbs. Even
the rain that drowned the world was over and gone at last ([Gen
8:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#001).md), and God promised to drown the
world no more, which was a type and figure of the covenant of grace,
[Isa 54:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#009.md). \[3.\] The flowers appear
on the earth. All winter they are dead and buried in their roots, and
there is no sign of them; but in the spring they revive, and show
themselves in a wonderful variety and verdure, and, like the dew that
produces them, tarry not for man, [Mic
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007.md). They appear, but they will soon
disappear again, and man in herein like the flower of the field, [Job
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#002.md). \[4.\] The time of singing of
birds has come. The little birds, which all the winter lie hid in their
retirements and scarcely live, when the spring returns forget all the
calamities of the winter, and to the best of their capacity chant forth
the praises of their Creator. Doubtless he who understands the birds
that cry for want ([Psa 147:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#009).md) takes
notice of those that sing for joy [Psa
104:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#012.md). The singing of the birds may
shame our silence in God's praises, who are better fed ([Mat
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#026).md), and better taught ([Job
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#011).md), and are of more value than
many sparrows. They live without inordinate care ([Mat
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#026).md) and therefore they sing, while
we murmur. \[5.\] The voice of the turtle is heard in our land, which is
one of the season-birds mentioned [Jer
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#007.md), that observe the time of their
coming and the time of their singing, and so shame us who know not the
judgment of the Lord, understand not the times, nor do that which is
beautiful in its season, do not sing in singing time. \[6.\] The
fig-tree puts forth her green figs, by which we know that summer is nigh
([Mat 24:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#032).md), when the green figs will
be ripe figs and fit for use; and the vines with the tender grape give a
good smell. The earth produces not only flowers ([Sol
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#012).md), but fruits; and the smell of
the fruits, which are profitable, is to be preferred far before that of
the flowers, which are only for show and pleasure. Serpents, they say,
are driven away by the smell of the vines; and who is the old serpent,
and who the true vine, we know very well.

(2.) Now this description of the returning spring, as a reason for
coming away with Christ, is applicable \[1.\] To the introducing of the
gospel in the room of the Old Testament dispensation, during which it
had been winter time with the church. Christ's gospel warms that which
was cold, makes that fruitful which before was dead and barren; when it
comes to any place it puts a beauty and glory upon that place ([Co2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007.md), [Co2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#008).md) and furnishes occasion for joy.
Spring-time is pleasant time, and so is gospel-time. Aspice venturo
laetentur ut omnia seclo - Behold what joy the dawning age inspires!
said Virgil, from the Sibyls, perhaps with more reference to the setting
up of the Messiah's kingdom at that time than he himself thought of. See
[Psa 96:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011.md). Arise then, and improve
this spring-time. Come away from the world and the flesh, come into
fellowship with Christ, [Co1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009.md).
\[2.\] To the delivering of the church from the power of persecuting
enemies, and the restoring of liberty and peace to it, after a severe
winter of suffering and restraint. When the storms of trouble are over
and gone, when the voice of the turtle, the joyful sound of the gospel
of Christ, is again heard, and ordinances are enjoyed with freedom, then
arise and come away to improve the happy juncture. Walk in the light of
the Lord; sing in the ways of the Lord. When the churches had rest, then
were they edified, [Act 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031.md). \[3.\]
To the conversion of sinners from a state of nature to a state of grace.
That blessed change is like the return of the spring, a universal change
and a very comfortable one; it is a new creation; it is being born
again. The soul that was hard, and cold, and frozen, and unprofitable,
like the earth in winter, becomes fruitful, like the earth in spring,
and by degrees, like it, brings its fruits to perfection. This blessed
change is owing purely to the approaches and influences of the sun of
righteousness, who calls to us from heaven to arise and come away; come,
gather in summer. \[4.\] To the consolations of the saints after a state
of inward dejection and despondency. A child of God, under doubts and
fears, is like the earth in winter, its nights long, its days dark, good
affections chilled, nothing done, nothing got, the hand sealed up. But
comfort will return; the birds shall sing again, and the flowers appear.
Arise therefore, poor drooping soul, and come away with thy beloved.
Arise, and shake thyself from the dust, [Isa
52:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#002.md). Arise, shine, for thy light has
come ([Isa 60:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001).md); walk in that light,
[Isa 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#005.md). \[5.\] To the resurrection
of the body at the last day, and the glory to be revealed. The bones
that lay in the grave, as the roots of the plants in the ground during
the winter, shall then flourish as a herb, [Isa
66:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#014.md); [Isa
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019.md). That will be an eternal
farewell to winter and a joyful entrance upon an everlasting spring.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sol 2:14</span></span>

Here is, I. The encouraging invitation which Christ gives to the church,
and every believing soul, to come into communion with him, [Sol
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014.md).

1\. His love is now his dove; David had called the church God's
turtle-dove ([Psa 84:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001) :19.md), and so
she is here called; a dove for beauty, her wings covered with silver
([Psa 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#013).md), for innocence and
inoffensiveness; a gracious spirit is a dove-like spirit, harmless,
loving quietness and cleanliness, and faithful to Christ, as the turtle
to her mate. The Spirit descended like a dove on Christ, and so he does
on all Christians, making them of a meek and quiet spirit. She is
Christ's dove, for he owns her and delights in her; she can find no rest
but in him and his ark, and therefore to him, as her Noah, she returns.

2\. This dove is in the clefts of the rock and in the secret places of
the stairs. This speaks either, (1.) Her praise. Christ is the rock, to
whom she flies for shelter and in whom alone she can think herself safe
and find herself easy, as a dove in the hole of a rock, when struck at
by the birds of prey, [Jer 48:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#028.md).
Moses was hid in a cleft of the rock, that he might behold something of
God's glory, which otherwise he could not have borne the brightness of.
She retires into the secret places of the stairs, where she may be
alone, undisturbed, and may the better commune with her own heart. Good
Christians will find time to be private. Christ often withdrew to a
mountain himself alone, to pray. Or, (2.) her blame. She crept into the
clefts of the rock, and the secret places, for fear and shame, any where
to hide her head, being heartless and discouraged, and shunning even the
sight of her beloved. Being conscious to herself of her own unfitness
and unworthiness to come into his presence, and speak to him, she drew
back, and was like a silly dove without heart, [Hos
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#011.md).

3\. Christ graciously calls her out of her retirements: Come, let me see
thy countenance, let me hear thy voice. She was mourning like a dove
([Isa 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#014).md), bemoaning herself like
the doves of the valleys, where they are near the clefts of the
impending rocks, mourning for her iniquities ([Eze
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#016).md) and refusing to be comforted.
But Christ calls her to lift up her face without spot, being purged from
an evil conscience ([Job 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#015.md); [Job
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#026).md), to come boldly to the throne
of grace, having a great high priest there ([Heb
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#016).md), to tell what her petition is
and what her request: Let me hear thy voice, hear what thou hast to say;
what would you that I should do unto you? Speak freely, speak up, and
fear not a slight or repulse.

4\. For her encouragement, he tells her the good thoughts he had of her,
whatever she thought of herself: Sweet is thy voice; thy praying voice,
though thou canst but chatter like a crane or a swallow ([Isa
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#014).md); it is music in God's ears. He
has assured us that the prayer of the upright is his delight; he smelled
a sweet savour from Noah's sacrifice, and the spiritual sacrifices are
no less acceptable, [Pe1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md). This
does not so much commend our services as God's gracious condescension in
making the best of them, and the efficacy of the much incense which is
offered with the prayers of saints, [Rev
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003.md). "That countenance of thine, which
thou art ashamed of, is comely, though now mournful, much more will it
be so when it becomes cheerful." Then the voice of prayer is sweet and
acceptable to God when the countenance, the conversation in which we
show ourselves before men, is holy, and so comely, and agreeable to our
profession. Those that are sanctified have the best comeliness.

II\. The charge which Christ gives to his servants to oppose and
suppress that which is a terror to his church and drives her, like a
poor frightened dove, into the clefts of the rock, and which is an
obstruction and prejudice to the interests of his kingdom in this world
and in the heart ([Sol 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#015).md): Take us
the foxes (take them for us, for it is good service both to Christ and
the church), the little foxes, that creep in insensibly; for, though
they are little, they do great mischief, they spoil the vines, which
they must by no means be suffered to do at any time, especially now when
our vines have tender grapes that must be preserved, or the vintage will
fail. Believers are as vines, weak but useful plants; their fruits are
as tender crops at first, which must have time to come to maturity. This
charge to take the foxes is, 1. A charge to particular believers to
mortify their own corruptions, their sinful appetites and passions,
which are as foxes, little foxes, that destroy their graces and
comforts, quash good motions, crush good beginnings, and prevent their
coming to perfection. Seize the little foxes, the first risings of sin,
the littles ones of Babylon ([Psa
137:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#009).md), those sins that seem little,
for they often prove very dangerous. Whatever we find a hindrance to us
in that which is good we must put away. 2. A charge to all in their
places to oppose and prevent the spreading of all such opinions and
practices as tend to corrupt men's judgments, debauch their consciences,
perplex their minds, and discourage their inclinations to virtue and
piety. Persecutors are foxes ([Luk
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#032).md); false prophets are foxes, [Eze
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#004.md). Those that sow the tares of
heresy or schism, and, like Diotrephes, trouble the peace of the church
and obstruct the progress of the gospel, they are the foxes, the little
foxes, which must not be knocked on the head (Christ came not to destroy
men's lives), but taken, that they may be tamed, or else restrained from
doing mischief.

III\. The believing profession which the church makes of her relation to
Christ, and the satisfaction she take sin her interest in him and
communion with him, [Sol 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#016.md). He had
called her to rise and come away with him, to let him see her face and
hear her voice; now this is her answer to that call, in which, though at
present in the dark and at a distance,

1\. She comforts herself with the thoughts of the mutual interest and
relation that were between her and her beloved: My beloved to me and I
to him, so the original reads it very emphatically; the conciseness of
the language speaks the largeness of her affection: "What he is to me
and I to him may better be conceived than expressed." Note, (1.) It is
the unspeakable privilege of true believers that Christ is theirs: My
beloved is mine; this denotes not only propriety ("I have a title to
him") but possession and tenure - "I receive from his fulness."
Believers are partakers of Christ; they have not only an interest in
him, but the enjoyment of him, are taken not only in the covenant, but
into communion with him. All the benefits of his glorious undertaking,
as Mediator, are made over to them. He is that to them which the world
neither is nor can be, all that which they need and desire, and which
will make a complete happiness for them. All he is is theirs, and all he
has, all he has done, and all he is doing; all he has promised in the
gospel, all he has prepared in heaven, all is yours. (2.) It is the
undoubted character of all true believers that they are Christ's, and
then, and then only, he is theirs. They have given their own selves to
him ([Co2 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#005).md); they receive his
doctrine and obey his laws; they bear his image and espouse his
interest; they belong to Christ. If we be his, his wholly, his only, his
for ever, we may take the comfort of his being ours.

2\. She comforts herself with the thoughts of the communications of his
grace to his people: He feeds among the lilies. When she wants the
tokens of his favour to her in particular, she rejoices in the assurance
of his presence with all believers in general, who are lilies in his
eyes. He feeds among them, that is, he takes as much pleasure in them
and their assemblies as a man does in his table or in his garden, for he
walks in the midst of the golden candlesticks; he delights to converse
with them, and to do them good.

IV\. The church's hope and expectation of Christ's coming, and her
prayer grounded thereupon. 1. She doubts not but that the day will break
and the shadows will flee away. The gospel-day will dawn, and the
shadows of the ceremonial law will flee away. This was the comfort of
the Old Testament church, that, after the long night of that dark
dispensation, the day-spring from on high would at length visit them, to
give light to those that sit in darkness. When the sun rises the shades
of the night vanish, so do the shadows of the day when the substance
comes. The day of comfort will come after a night of desertion. Or it
may refer to the second coming of Christ, and the eternal happiness of
the saints; the shadows of our present state will flee away, our
darkness and doubts, our griefs and all our grievances, and a glorious
day shall dawn, a morning when the upright shall have dominion, a day
that shall have no night after it. 2. She begs the presence of her
beloved, in the mean time, to support and comfort her: "Turn, my
beloved, turn to me, come and visit me, come and relieve me, be with me
always to the end of the age. In the day of my extremity, make haste to
help me, make no long tarrying. Come over even the mountains of
division, interposing time and days, with some gracious anticipations of
that light and love." 3. She begs that he would not only turn to her for
the present, but hasten his coming to fetch her to himself. "Even so,
come, Lord Jesus, come quickly. Though there be mountains in the way,
thou canst, like a roe, or a young hart, step over them with ease. O
show thyself to me, or take me up to thee."
