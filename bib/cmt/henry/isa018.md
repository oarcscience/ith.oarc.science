### [Isaiah Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 18:0</span></span>

Whatever country it is that is meant here by "the land shadowing with
wings," here is a woe denounced against it, for God has, upon his
people's account, a quarrel with it. I. They threaten God's people ([Isa
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001.md), [Isa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002).md). II. All the neighbours are
hereupon called to take notice what will be the issue ([Isa
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#003).md). III. Though God seem
unconcerned in the distress of his people for a time, he will at length
appear against their enemies and will remarkable cut them off ([Isa
18:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#004).md). IV. This shall redound very
much to the glory of God ([Isa 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#007).md).

[Isaiah 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 18:1</span></span>

Interpreters are very much at a loss where to find this land that lies
beyond the rivers of Cush. Some take it to be Egypt, a maritime country,
and full of rivers, and which courted Israel to depend upon them, but
proved broken reeds; but against this it is strongly objected that the
next chapter is distinguished from this by the title of the burden of
Egypt. Others take it to be Ethiopia, and read it, which lies near, or
about, the rivers of Ethiopia, not that in Africa, which lay south of
Egypt, but that which we call Arabia, which lay east of Canaan, which
Tirhakah was now king of. He thought to protect the Jews, as it were,
under the shadow of his wings, by giving a powerful diversion to the
king of Assyria, when he made a descent upon his country, at the time
that he was attacking Jerusalem, [Kg2
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#009.md). But though by his ambassadors he
bade defiance to the king of Assyria, and encouraged the Jews to depend
upon him, God by the prophet slights him, and will not go forth with
him; he may take his own course, but God will take another course to
protect Jerusalem, while he suffers the attempt of Tirhakah to miscarry
and his Arabian army to be ruined; for the Assyrian army shall become a
present or sacrifice to the Lord of hosts, and to the place of his name,
by the hand of an angel, not by the hand of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia,
[Isa 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#007.md). This is a very probable
exposition of this chapter. But from a hint of Dr. Lightfoot's, in his
Harmony of the Old Testament, I incline to understand this chapter as a
prophecy against Assyria, and so a continuation of the prophecy in the
last three verses of the foregoing chapter, with which therefore this
should be joined. That was against the army of the Assyrians which
rushed in upon Judah; this is against the land of Assyria itself, which
lay beyond the rivers of Arabia, that is, the rivers Euphrates and
Tigris, which bordered on Arabia Deserta. And in calling it the land
shadowing with wings he seems to refer to what he himself had said of it
([Isa 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008).md), that the stretching out of
his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel! The prophet
might perhaps describe the Assyrians by such dark expressions, not
naming them, for the same reason that St. Paul, in his prophecy, speaks
of the Roman empire by a periphrasis: He who now letteth, [Th2
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#007.md). Here is,

I. The attempt made by this land (whatever it is) upon a nation
scattered and peeled, [Isa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002.md). Swift
messengers are sent by water to proclaim war against them, as a nation
marked by Providence, and meted out, to be trodden under foot. Whether
this refer to the Ethiopians waging war with the Assyrians, or the
Assyrians with Judah, it teaches us, 1. That a people which have been
terrible from their beginning, have made a figure and borne a mighty
sway, may yet become scattered and peeled, and may be spoiled even by
their own rivers, that should enrich both the husbandman and the
merchant. Nations which have been formidable, and have kept all in awe
about them, may by a concurrence of accidents become despicable and an
easy prey to their insulting neighbours. 2. Princes and states that are
ambitious of enlarging their territories will always have some pretence
or other to quarrel with those whose countries they have a mind to. "It
is a nation that has been terrible, and therefore we must be revenged on
it; it is now a nation scattered and peeled, meted out and trodden down,
and therefore it will be an easy prey for us." Perhaps it was not
brought so low as they represented it. God's people are trampled on as a
nation scattered and peeled; but whoever think to swallow them up may
find them still as terrible as they have been from their beginning; they
are cast down, but not deserted, not destroyed.

II\. The alarm sounded to the nations about, by which they are summoned
to take notice of what God is about to do, [Isa
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#003.md). The Ethiopians and Assyrians
have their counsels and designs, which they have laid deep, and promise
themselves much from, and, in prosecution of them, send their
ambassadors and messengers from place to place; but let us now enquire
what the great God says to all this. 1. He lifts up an ensign upon the
mountains, and blows a trumpet, by which he proclaims war against the
enemies of his church, and calls in all her friends and well-wishers
into her service, [Isa 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#003.md). He gives
notice that he is about to do some great work, as Lord of hosts. 2. All
the world is bidden to take notice of it; all the dwellers on earth must
see the ensign and hear the trumpet, must observe the motions of the
divine providence and attend the directions of the divine will. Let all
enlist under God's banner, and be on his side, and hearken to the
trumpet of his word, which gives not an uncertain sound.

III\. The assurance God gives to his prophet, by him to be given to his
people, that, though he might seem for a time to sit by as an
unconcerned spectator, yet he would certainly and seasonably appear for
the comfort of his people and the confusion of his and their enemies
([Isa 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#004).md): So the Lord said unto me.
Men will have their saying, but God also will have his; and, as we may
be sure his word shall stand, so he often whispers it in the ears of his
servants the prophets. When he says, I will take my rest, it is not as
if he were weary of governing the world, of as if he either needed or
desired to retire from it and repose himself; but it intimates that the
great God has a perfect, undisturbed, enjoyment of himself, in the midst
of all the agitations and changes of this world (the Lord sits even upon
the floods unshaken; the Eternal Mind is always easy), and, though he
may sometimes seem to his people as if he took not wonted notice of what
is done in this lower world (they are tempted to think he is as one
asleep, or as one astonished, [Psa
44:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#023.md); [Jer
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#009).md), yet even then he knows very
well what men are doing and what he himself will do.

1\. He will take care of his people, and be a shelter to them. He will
regard his dwelling-place; his eye and his heart are, and shall be, upon
it for good continually. Zion is his rest for ever, where he will dwell;
and he will look after it (so some read it); he will lift up the light
of his countenance upon it, will consider over it what is to be done,
and will be sure to do all for the best. He will adapt the comforts and
refreshments he provides for his people to the exigencies of their case;
and they will therefore be acceptable, because seasonable. (1.) Like a
clear heat after rain (so the margin), which is very reviving and
pleasant, and makes the herbs to flourish. (2.) Like a dew and a cloud
in the heat of harvest, which are very welcome, the dew to the ground
and the cloud to the labourers. Note, There is that in God which is a
shelter and refreshment to his people in all weathers and arms them
against the inconveniences of every change. Is the weather cool? There
is that in his favour which will warm them. Is it hot? There is that in
his favour which will cool them. Great men have their winter-house and
their summer-house ([Amo 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#015).md); but
those that are at home with God have both in him.

2\. He will reckon with his and their enemies, [Isa
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#005.md), [Isa
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#006.md). When the Assyrian army promises
itself a plentiful harvest in the taking of Jerusalem and the plundering
of that rich city, when the bud of that project is perfect, before the
harvest is gathered in, while the sour grape of their enmity to Hezekiah
and his people is ripening in the flower and the design is just ready to
be put in execution, God shall destroy that army as easily as the
husbandman cuts off the sprigs of the vine with pruning hooks, or
because the grape is sour and good for nothing, and will not be cured,
takes away and cuts down the branches. This seems to point at the
overthrow of the Assyrian army by a destroying angel, when the dead
bodies of the soldiers were scattered like the branches and sprigs of a
wild vine, which the husbandman has cut to pieces. And they shall be
left to the fowls of the mountains, and the beasts of the earth, to prey
upon, both winter and summer; for as God's people are protected all
seasons of the year, both in cold and heat ([Isa
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#004).md), so their enemies are at all
seasons exposed; birds and beasts of prey shall both summer and winter
upon them, till they are quite ruined.

IV\. The tribute of praise which should be brought to God from all this
([Isa 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#007).md): In that time, when this
shall be accomplished, shall the present be brought unto the Lord of
hosts. 1. Some understand this of the conversion of the Ethiopians to
the faith of Christ in the latter days, of which we have the specimen
and beginning in Philip's baptizing the Ethiopian eunuch, [Act
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#027.md), etc. Those that were a people
scattered and peeled, meted out, and trodden down ([Isa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002).md), shall be a present to the Lord:
and, though they seem useless and worthless, they shall be an acceptable
present to him who judges of men by the sincerity of their faith and
love, not by the pomp and prosperity of their outward condition.
Therefore the gospel was ministered to the Gentiles that the offering up
of the Gentiles might be acceptable, [Rom
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#016.md). It is prophesied ([Psa
68:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#031).md) that Ethiopia shall soon
stretch out her hands unto God. 2. Others understand it of the spoil of
Sennacherib's army, out of which, as usual, presents were brought to the
Lord of hosts, [Num 31:50](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#050.md). It was the
present of a people scattered and peeled. (1.) It was won from the
Assyrians, who were now themselves reduced to such a condition as they
scornfully described Judah to be in, [Isa
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001.md). Those that unjustly trample upon
others shall themselves be justly trampled upon. (2.) It was offered by
the people of God, who were, in disdain, called a people scattered and
peeled. God will put honour upon his people, though men put contempt
upon them. Lastly, Observe, The present that is brought to the Lord of
hosts must be brought to the place of the name of the Lord of hosts;
what is offered to God must be offered in the way that he has appointed;
we must be sure to attend him, and expect him to meet us, where he
records his name.
