### [Psalms Chapter 88](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 88:0</span></span>

This psalm is a lamentation, one of the most melancholy of all the
psalms; and it does not conclude, as usually the melancholy psalms do,
with the least intimation of comfort or joy, but, from first to last, it
is mourning and woe. It is not upon a public account that the psalmist
here complains (here is no mention of the afflictions of the church),
but only upon a personal account, especially trouble of mind, and the
grief impressed upon his spirits both by his outward afflictions and by
the remembrance of his sins and the fear of God's wrath. It is reckoned
among the penitential psalms, and it is well when our fears are thus
turned into the right channel, and we take occasion from our worldly
grievances to sorrow after a godly sort. In this psalm we have, I. The
great pressure of spirit that the psalmist was under ([Psa
88:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#003).md). II. The wrath of God, which
was the cause of that pressure ([Psa
88:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#007.md), [Psa
88:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#015).md). III. The wickedness of his
friends ([Psa 88:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#008.md), [Psa
88:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#018).md). IV. The application he made to
God by prayer ([Psa 88:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#001.md), [Psa
88:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#002.md), [Psa
88:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#009.md), [Psa
88:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#013).md). V. His humble expostulations
and pleadings with God ([Psa 88:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#010.md),
[Psa 88:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#012.md), [Psa
88:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#014).md). Those who are in trouble of
mind may sing this psalm feelingly; those that are not ought to sing it
thankfully, blessing God that it is not their case.

A song or psalm for the sons of Korah, to the chief musician upon
Mahalath Leannoth, Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite.

[Psalms 88:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 88:1</span></span>

It should seem, by the titles of this and the following psalm, that
Heman was the penman of the one and Ethan of the other. There were two,
of these names, who were sons of Zerah the son of Judah, [Ch1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#004.md), [Ch1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006.md). There were two others famed for
wisdom, [Kg1 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#031.md), where, to magnify
Solomon's wisdom, he is said to be wiser than Heman and Ethan. Whether
the Heman and Ethan who were Levites and precentors in the songs of Zion
were the same we are not sure, nor which of these, nor whether any of
these, were the penmen of these psalms. There was a Heman that was one
of the chief singers, who is called the king's seer, or prophet, in the
words of God ([Ch1 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#005).md); it is
probable that this also was a seer, and yet could see no comfort for
himself, an instructor and comforter of others, and yet himself putting
comfort away from him. The very first words of the psalm are the only
words of comfort and support in all the psalm. There is nothing about
him but clouds and darkness; but, before he begins his complaint, he
calls God the God of his salvation, which intimates both that he looked
for salvation, bad as things were, and that he looked up to God for the
salvation and depended upon him to be the author of it. Now here we have
the psalmist,

I. A man of prayer, one that gave himself to prayer at all times, but
especially now that he was in affliction; for is any afflicted? let him
pray. It is his comfort that he had prayed; it is his complaint that,
notwithstanding his prayer, he was still in affliction. He was, 1. Very
earnest in prayer: "I have cried unto thee ([Psa
88:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#001).md), and have stretched out my hands
unto thee ([Psa 88:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#009).md), as one that
would take hold on thee, and even catch at the mercy, with a holy fear
of coming short and missing of it." 2. He was very frequent and constant
in prayer: I have called upon thee daily ([Psa
88:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#009).md), nay, day and night, [Psa
88:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#001.md). For thus men ought always to
pray, and not to faint; God's own elect cry day and night to him, not
only morning and evening, beginning every day and every night with
prayer, but spending the day and night in prayer. This is indeed praying
always; and then we shall speed in prayer, when we continue instant in
prayer. 3. He directed his prayer to God, and from him expected and
desired an answer ([Psa 88:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#002).md): "Let my
prayer come before thee, to be accepted of thee, not before men, to be
seen of them, as the Pharisees' prayers." He does not desire that men
should hear them, but, "Lord, incline thy ear unto my cry, for to that I
refer myself; give what answer to it thou pleasest."

II\. He was a man of sorrows, and therefore some make him, in this
psalm, a type of Christ, whose complaints on the cross, and sometimes
before, were much to the same purport with this psalm. He cries out
([Psa 88:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#003).md): My soul is full of
troubles; so Christ said, Now is my soul troubled; and, in his agony, My
soul is exceedingly sorrowful even unto death, like the psalmist's here,
for he says, My life draws nigh unto the grave. Heman was a very wise
man, and a very good man, a man of God, and a singer too, and one may
therefore suppose him to have been a man of a cheerful spirit, and yet
now a man of sorrowful spirit, troubled in mind, and upon the brink of
despair. Inward trouble is the sorest trouble, and that which,
sometimes, the best of God's saints and servants have been severely
exercised with. The spirit of man, of the greatest of men, will not
always sustain his infirmity, but will droop and sink under it; who then
can bear a wounded spirit?

III\. He looked upon himself as a dying man, whose heart was ready to
break with sorrow ([Psa 88:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#005).md): "Free
among the dead (one of that ghastly corporation), like the slain that
lie in the grave, whose rotting and perishing nobody takes notice of or
is concerned for, nay, whom thou rememberest no more, to protect or
provide for the dead bodies, but they become an easy prey to corruption
and the worms; they are cut off from thy hand, which used to be employed
in supporting them and reaching out to them; but, now there is no more
occasion for this, they are cut off from it and cut off by it" (for God
will not stretch out his hand to the grave, [Job
30:24](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#024).md); "thou hast laid me in the
lowest pit, as low as possible, my condition low, my spirits low, in
darkness, in the deep ([Psa 88:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#006).md),
sinking, and seeing no way open of escape, brought to the last
extremity, and ready to give up all for gone." Thus greatly may good men
be afflicted, such dismal apprehensions may they have concerning their
afflictions, and such dark conclusions may they sometimes be ready to
make concerning the issue of them, through the power of melancholy and
the weakness of faith.

IV\. He complained most of God's displeasure against him, which infused
the wormwood and the gall into the affliction and the misery ([Psa
88:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#007).md): Thy wrath lies hard upon me.
Could he have discerned the favour and love of God in his affliction, it
would have lain light upon him; but it lay hard, very hard, upon him, so
that he was ready to sink and faint under it. The impressions of this
wrath upon his spirits were God's waves with which he afflicted him,
which rolled upon him, one on the neck of another, so that he scarcely
recovered from one dark thought before he was oppressed with another;
these waves beat against him with noise and fury; not some, but all, of
God's waves were made use of in afflicting him and bearing him down.
Even the children of God's love may sometimes apprehend themselves
children of wrath, and no outward trouble can lie so hard upon them as
that apprehension.

V. It added to his affliction that his friends deserted him and made
themselves strange to him. When we are in trouble it is some comfort to
have those about us that love us, and sympathize with us; but this good
man had none such, which gives him occasion, not to accuse them, or
charge them with treachery, ingratitude, and inhumanity, but to complain
to God, with an eye to his hand in this part of the affliction ([Psa
88:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#008).md): Thou hast put away my
acquaintance far from me. Providence had removed them, or rendered them
incapable of being serviceable to him, or alienated their affections
from him; for every creature is that to us (and no more) that God makes
it to be. If our old acquaintance be shy of us, and those we expect
kindness from prove unkind, we must bear that with the same patient
submission to the divine will that we do other afflictions, [Job
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#013.md). Nay, his friends were not only
strange to him, but even hated him, because he was poor and in distress:
"Thou hast made me an abomination to them; they are not only shy of me,
but sick of me, and I am looked upon by them, not only with contempt,
but with abhorrence." Let none think it strange concerning such a trial
as this, when Heman, who was so famed for wisdom, was yet, when the
world frowned upon him, neglected, as a vessel in which is no pleasure.

VI\. He looked upon his case as helpless and deplorable: "I am shut up,
and I cannot come forth, a close prisoner, under the arrests of divine
wrath, and no way open of escape." He therefore lies down and sinks
under his troubles, because he sees not any probability of getting out
of them. For thus he bemoans himself ([Psa
88:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#009).md): My eye mourneth by reason of
affliction. Sometimes giving vent to grief by weeping gives some ease to
a troubled spirit. Yet weeping must not hinder praying; we must sow in
tears: My eye mourns, but I cry unto thee daily. Let prayers and tears
go together, and they shall be accepted together. I have heard thy
prayers, I have seen thy tears.

[Psalms 88:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 88:10</span></span>

In these verses,

I. The psalmist expostulates with God concerning the present deplorable
condition he was in ([Psa 88:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#010).md):
"Wilt thou do a miraculous work to the dead, and raise them to life
again? Shall those that are dead and buried rise up to praise thee? No;
they leave it to their children to rise up in their room to praise God;
none expects that they should do it; and wherefore should they rise,
wherefore should they live, but to praise God? The life we are born to
at first, and the life we hope to rise to at last, must thus be spent.
But shall thy lovingkindness to thy people be declared in the grave,
either by those or to those that lie buried there? And thy faithfulness
to thy promise, shall that be told in destruction? shall thy wonders be
wrought in the dark, or known there, and thy righteousness in the grave,
which is the land of forgetfulness, where men remember nothing, nor are
themselves remembered? Departed souls may indeed know God's wonders and
declare his faithfulness, justice, and lovingkindness; but deceased
bodies cannot; they can neither receive God's favours in comfort nor
return them in praise." Now we will not suppose these expostulations to
be the language of despair, as if he thought God could not help him or
would not, much less do they imply any disbelief of the resurrection of
the dead at the last day; but he thus pleads with God for speedy relief:
"Lord, thou art good, thou art faithful, thou art righteous; these
attributes of thine will be made known in my deliverance, but, if it be
not hastened, it will come too late; for I shall be dead and past
relief, dead and not capable of receiving any comfort, very shortly."
Job often pleaded thus, [Job 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#008.md); [Job
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021.md).

II\. He resolves to continue instant in prayer, and the more so because
the deliverance was deferred ([Psa
88:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#013).md): "Unto thee have I cried many a
time, and found comfort in so doing, and therefore I will continue to do
so; in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee." Note, Though our
prayers be not answered immediately, yet we must not therefore give over
praying, because the vision is for an appointed time, and at the end it
shall speak and not lie. God delays the answer in order that he may try
our patience and perseverance in prayer. He resolves to seek God early,
in the morning, when his spirits were lively, and before the business of
the day began to crowd in - in the morning, after he had been tossed
with cares, and sorrowful thoughts in the silence and solitude of the
night; but how could he say, My prayer shall prevent thee? Not as if he
could wake sooner to pray than God to hear and answer; for he neither
slumbers nor sleeps; but it intimates that he would be up earlier than
ordinary to pray, would prevent (that is, go before) his usual hour of
prayer. The greater our afflictions are the more solicitous and serious
we should be in prayer. "My prayer shall present itself before thee, and
be betimes with thee, and shall not stay for the encouragement of the
beginning of mercy, but reach towards it with faith and expectation even
before the day dawns." God often prevents our prayers and expectations
with his mercies; let us prevent his mercies with our prayers and
expectations.

III\. He sets down what he will say to God in prayer. 1. He will humbly
reason with God concerning the abject afflicted condition he was now in
([Psa 88:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#014).md): "Lord, why castest thou
off my soul? What is it that provokes thee to treat me as one abandoned?
Show me wherefore thou contendest with me." He speaks it with wonder
that God should cast off an old servant, should cast off one that was
resolved not to cast him off: "No wonder men cast me off; but, Lord, why
dost thou, whose gifts and callings are without repentance? Why hidest
thou thy face, as one angry at me, that either hast no favour for me or
wilt not let me know that thou hast?" Nothing grieves a child of God so
much as God's hiding his face from him, nor is there any thing he so
much dreads as God's casting off his soul. If the sun be clouded, that
darkens the earth; but if the sun should abandon the earth, and quite
cast it off, what a dungeon would it be! 2. He will humbly repeat the
same complaints he had before made, until God have mercy on him. Two
things he represents to God as his grievances: - (1.) That God was a
terror to him: I suffer thy terrors, [Psa
88:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#015.md). He had continual frightful
apprehensions of the wrath of God against him for his sins and the
consequences of that wrath. It terrified him to think of God, of falling
into his hands and appearing before him to receive his doom from him. He
perspired and trembled at the apprehension of God's displeasure against
him, and the terror of his majesty. Note, Even those that are designed
for God's favours may yet, for a time, suffer his terrors. The spirit of
adoption is first a spirit of bondage to fear. Poor Job complained of
the terrors of God setting themselves in array against him, [Job
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#004.md). The psalmist here explains
himself, and tells us what he means by God's terrors, even his fierce
wrath. Let us see what dreadful impressions those terrors made upon him,
and how deeply they wounded him. \[1.\] They had almost taken away his
life: "I am so afflicted with them that I am ready to die, and" (as the
word is) "to give up the ghost. Thy terrors have cut me off," [Psa
88:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#016.md). What is hell, that eternal
excision, by which damned sinners are for ever cut off from God and all
happiness, but God's terrors fastening and preying upon their guilty
consciences? \[2.\] They had almost taken away the use of his reason:
When I suffer thy terrors I am distracted. This sad effect the terrors
of the Lord have had upon many, and upon some good men, who have thereby
been put quite out of the possession of their own souls, a most piteous
case, and which ought to be looked upon with great compassion. \[3.\]
This had continued long: From my youth up I suffer thy terrors. He had
been from his childhood afflicted with melancholy, and trained up in
sorrow under the discipline of that school. If we begin our days with
trouble, and the days of our mourning have been prolonged a great while,
let us not think it strange, but let tribulation work patience. It is
observable the Heman, who became eminently wise and good, was afflicted
and ready to die, and suffered God's terrors, from his youth up. Thus
many have found it was good for them to bear the yoke in their youth,
that sorrow has been much better for them than laughter would have been,
and that being much afflicted, and often ready to die, when they were
young, they have, by the grace of God, got such an habitual seriousness
and weanedness from the world as have been of great use to them all
their days. Sometimes those whom God designs for eminent services are
prepared for them by exercises of this kind. \[4.\] His affliction was
now extreme, and worse than ever. God's terrors now came round about
him, so that from all sides he was assaulted with variety of troubles,
and he had no comfortable gale from any point of the compass. They broke
in upon him together like an inundation of water; and this daily, and
all the day; so that he had no rest, no respite, not the lest
breathing-time, no lucid intervals, nor any gleam of hope. Such was the
calamitous state of a very wise and good man; he was so surrounded with
terrors that he could find no place of shelter, nor lie any where under
the wind. (2.) That no friend he had in the world was a comfort to him
([Psa 88:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#018).md): Lover and friend hast
thou put far from me; some are dead, others at a distance, and perhaps
many unkind. Next to the comforts of religion are those of friendship
and society; therefore to be friendless is (as to this life) almost to
be comfortless; and to those who have had friends, but have lost them,
the calamity is the more grievous. With this the psalmist here closes
his complaint, as if this were that which completed his woe and gave the
finishing stroke to the melancholy piece. If our friends are put far
from us by scattering providences, nay, if by death our acquaintance are
removed into darkness, we have reason to look upon it as a sore
affliction, but must acknowledge and submit to the hand of God in it.
