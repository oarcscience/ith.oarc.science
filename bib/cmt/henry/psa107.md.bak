### [Psalms Chapter 107](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 107:0</span></span>

The psalmist, having in the two foregoing psalms celebrated the wisdom,
power, and goodness of God, in his dealings with his church in
particular, here observes some of the instances of his providential care
of the children of men in general, especially in their distresses; for
he is not only King of saints, but King of nations, not only the God of
Israel, but the God of the whole earth, and a common Father to all
mankind. Though this may especially refer to Israelites in their
personal capacity, yet there were those who pertained not to the
commonwealth of Israel and yet were worshippers of the true God; and
even those who worshipped images had some knowledge of a supreme
"Numen," to whom, when they were in earnest, they looked above all their
false gods. And of these, when they prayed in their distresses, God took
a particular care, I. The psalmist specifies some of the most common
calamities of human life, and shows how God succours those that labour
under them, in answer to their prayers. 1. Banishment and dispersion
([Psa 107:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#002).md). 2. Captivity and
imprisonment ([Psa 107:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#010).md). 3.
Sickness and distemper of body ([Psa
107:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#017).md). 4. Danger and distress at
sea ([Psa 107:23-32](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#023).md). These are put
for all similar perils, in which those that cry unto God have ever found
him a very present help. II. He specifies the varieties and vicissitudes
of events concerning nations and families, in all which God's hand is to
be eyed by his own people, with joyful acknowledgments of his goodness
([Psa 107:33-43](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#033).md). When we are in any
of these or the like distresses it will be comfortable to sing this
psalm, with application; but, if we be not, others are, and have been,
of whose deliverances it becomes us to give God the glory, for we are
members one of another.

[Psalms 107:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 107:1</span></span>

Here is, I. A general call to all to give thanks to God, [Psa
107:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#001.md). Let all that sing this psalm,
or pray over it, set themselves herein to give thanks to the Lord; and
those that have not any special matter for praise may furnish themselves
with matter enough from God's universal goodness. In the fountain he is
good; in the streams his mercy endures for ever and never fails.

II\. A particular demand hereof from the redeemed of the Lord, which may
well be applied spiritually to those that have an interest in the great
Redeemer and are saved by him from sin and hell. They have, of all
people, most reason to say that God is good, and his mercy everlasting;
these are the children of God that were scattered abroad, whom Christ
died to gather together in one, out of all lands, [Joh
11:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#052.md); [Mat
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031.md). But it seems here to be meant
of a temporal deliverance, wrought for them when in their distress they
cried unto the Lord, [Psa 107:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#006.md). Is
any afflicted? Let him pray. Does any pray? God will certainly hear and
help. When troubles become extreme that is man's time to cry; those who
but whispered prayer before then cry aloud, and then it is God's time to
succour. In the mount he will be seen. 1. They were in an enemy's
country, but God wrought out their rescue: He redeemed them from the
hand of the enemy ([Psa 107:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#002).md), not by
might or power, it may be ([Zac 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006).md),
nor by price or reward ([Isa 45:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013).md),
but by the Spirit of God working on the spirits of men. 2. They were
dispersed as out-casts, but God gathered them out of all the countries
whither they were scattered in the cloudy and dark day, that they might
again be incorporated, [Psa 107:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#003.md). See
[Deu 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#004.md); [Eze
34:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#012.md). God knows those that are his,
and where to find them. 3. They were bewildered, had no road to travel
in, no dwelling place to rest in, [Psa
107:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#004.md). When they were redeemed out of
the hand of the enemy, and gathered out of the lands, they were in
danger of perishing in their return home through the dry and barren
deserts. They wandered in the wilderness, where there was no trodden
path, no company, but a solitary way, no lodging, no conveniences, no
accommodations, no inhabited city where they might have quarters or
refreshment. But God led them forth by the right way ([Psa
107:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#007).md), directed them to an inn, nay,
directed them to a home, that they might go to a city of habitation,
which was inhabited, nay which them themselves should inhabit. This may
refer to poor travellers in general, those particularly whose way lay
through the wilds of Arabia, where we may suppose they were often at a
loss; and yet many in that distress were wonderfully relieved, so that
few perished. Note, We ought to take notice of the good hand of God's
providence over us in our journeys, going out and coming in, directing
us in our way, and providing for us places both to bait in and rest in.
Or (as some think) it has an eye to the wanderings of the children of
Israel in the wilderness for forty years; it is said ([Deu
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#010).md), God led them about, and yet
here he led them by the right way. God's way, though to us it seems
about, will appear at last to have been the right way. It is applicable
to our condition in this world; we are here as in a wilderness, have
here no continuing city, but dwell in tents as strangers and pilgrims.
But we are under the guidance of his wise and good providence, and, if
we commit ourselves to it, we shall be led in the right way to the city
that has foundations. 4. They were ready to perish for hunger ([Psa
107:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#005).md): Their soul even fainted in
them. They were spent with the fatigues of their journey and ready to
drop down for want of refreshment. Those that have constant plenty, and
are every day fed to the full, know not what a miserable case it is to
be hungry and thirsty, and to have no supply. This was sometimes the
case of Israel in the wilderness, and perhaps of other poor travellers;
but God's providence finds out ways to satisfy the longing soul and fill
the hungry soul with goodness, [Psa
107:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#009.md). Israel's wants were seasonably
supplied, and many have been wonderfully relieved when they were ready
to perish. The same God that has led us has fed us all our life long
unto this day, has fed us with food convenient, has provided food for
the soul, and filled the hungry soul with goodness. Those that hunger
and thirst after righteousness, after God, the living God, and communion
with him, shall be abundantly replenished with the goodness of his
house, both in grace and glory. Now for all this those who receive mercy
are called upon to return thanks ([Psa
107:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#008).md): Oh that men (it is meant
especially of those men whom God has graciously relieved) would praise
the Lord for his goodness to them in particular, and for his wonderful
works to others of the children of men! Note, (1.) God's works of mercy
are wonderful works, works of wonderful power considering the weakness,
and of wonderful grace considering the unworthiness, of those he shows
mercy to. (2.) It is expected of those who receive mercy from God that
they return praise to him. (3.) We must acknowledge God's goodness to
the children of men as well as to the children of God, to others as well
as to ourselves.

[Psalms 107:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 107:10</span></span>

We are to take notice of the goodness of God towards prisoners and
captives. Observe, 1. A description of this affliction. Prisoners are
said to sit in darkness ([Psa 107:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#010).md),
in dark dungeons, close prisons, which intimates that they are desolate
and disconsolate; they sit in the shadow of death, which intimates not
only great distress and trouble, but great danger. Prisoners are many
times appointed to die; they sit despairing to get out, but resolving to
make the best of it. They are bound in affliction, and many times in
iron, as Joseph. Thus sore a calamity is imprisonment, which should make
us prize liberty, and be thankful for it. 2. The cause of this
affliction, [Psa 107:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#011.md). It is because
they rebelled against the words of God. Wilful sin is rebellion against
the words of God; it is a contradiction to his truths and a violation of
his laws. They contemned the counsel of the Most High, and thought they
neither needed it nor could be the better for it; and those that will
not be counselled cannot be helped. Those that despise prophesying, that
regard not the admonitions of their own consciences nor the just
reproofs of their friends, contemn the counsel of the Most High, and for
this they are bound in affliction, both to punish them for and to
reclaim them from their rebellions. 3. The design of this affliction,
and that is to bring down their heart ([Psa
107:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#012).md), to humble them for sin, to
make them low in their own eyes, to cast down every high, proud,
aspiring thought. Afflicting providences must be improved as humbling
providences; and we not only lose the benefit of them, but thwart God's
designs and walk contrary to him in them if our hearts be unhumbled and
unbroken, as high and hard as ever under them. Is the estate brought
down with labour, the honour sunk? Have those that exalted themselves
fallen down, and is there none to help them? Let this bring down the
spirit to confess sin, to accept the punishment of it, and humbly to sue
for mercy and grace. 4. The duty of this afflicted state, and that is to
pray ([Psa 107:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#013).md): Then they cried
unto the Lord in their trouble, though before perhaps they had neglected
him. Prisoners have time to pray, who, when they were at liberty, could
not find time; they see they have need of God's help, though formerly
they thought they could do well enough without him. Sense will make men
cry when they are in trouble, but grace will direct them to cry unto the
Lord, from whom the affliction comes and who alone can remove it. 5.
Their deliverance out of the affliction: They cried unto the Lord, and
he saved them, [Psa 107:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#013.md). He brought
them out of darkness into light, welcome light, and then doubly sweet
and pleasant, brought them out of the shadow of death to the comforts of
life, and their liberty was to them life from the dead, [Psa
107:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#014.md). Were they fettered? He broke
their bands asunder. Were they imprisoned in strong castles? He broke
the gates of brass and the bars of iron wherewith those gates were made
fast; he did not put back, but cut in sunder. Note, When God will work
deliverance the greatest difficulties that lie in the way shall be made
nothing of. Gates of brass and bars of iron, as they cannot keep him out
from him people (he was with Joseph in the prison), so they cannot keep
them in when the time, the set-time, for their enlargement, comes. 6.
The return that is required from those whose bands God has loosed ([Psa
107:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#015).md): Let them praise the Lord for
his goodness, and take occasion from their own experience of it, and
share in it, to bless him for that goodness which the earth is full of,
the world and those that dwell therein.

[Psalms 107:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 107:17</span></span>

Bodily sickness is another of the calamities of this life which gives us
an opportunity of experiencing the goodness of God in recovering us, and
of that the psalmist speaks in these verses, where we may observe,

I. That we, by our sins, bring sickness upon ourselves and then it is
our duty to pray, [Psa 107:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#017.md). 1.
It is the sin of the soul that is the cause of sickness; we bring it
upon ourselves both meritoriously and efficiently: Fools, because of
their transgression, are thus afflicted; they are thus corrected for the
sins they have committed and thus cured of their evil inclinations to
sin. If we knew no sin, we should know no sickness; but the
transgression of our life, and the iniquity of our heart, make it
necessary. Sinners are fools; they wrong themselves, and all against
their own interest, not only their spiritual, but their secular
interest. They prejudice their bodily health by intemperance and
endanger their lives by indulging their appetites. This their way is
their folly, and they need the rod of correction to drive out the
foolishness that is bound up in their hearts. 2. The weakness of the
body is the effect of sickness, [Psa
107:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#018.md). When people are sick their
soul abhors all manner of meat; they not only have no desire to eat nor
power to digest it, but they nauseate it, and their stomach is turned
against it. And here they may read their sin in their punishment: those
that doted most on the meat that perishes, when they come to be sick are
sick of it, and the dainties they loved are loathed; what they took too
much of now they can take nothing of, which commonly follows upon the
overcharging of the heart with surfeiting and drunkenness. And when the
appetite is gone the life is as good as gone: They draw near unto the
gates of death; they are, in their own apprehension and in the
apprehension of all about them, at the brink of the grave, as ready to
be turned to destruction. 3. Then is a proper time for prayer: Then they
cry unto the Lord, [Psa 107:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#019.md). Is any
sick? Let him pray; let him be prayed for. Prayer is a salve for every
sore.

II\. That it is by the power and mercy of God that we are recovered from
sickness, and then it is our duty to be thankful. Compare with this [Job
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#018.md), [Job
33:28](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#028.md). 1. When those that are sick
call upon God he returns them an answer of peace. They cry unto him and
he saves them out of their distresses ([Psa
107:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#019).md); he removes their griefs and
prevents their fears. (1.) He does it easily: He sent his word and
healed them, [Psa 107:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#020.md). This may be
applied to the miraculous cures which Christ wrought when he was upon
earth, by a word's speaking; he said, Be clean, Be whole, and the work
was done. It may also be applied to the spiritual cures which the Spirit
of grace works in regeneration; he sends his word, and heals souls,
convinces, converts, sanctifies them, and all by the word. In the common
instances of recovery from sickness God in his providence does but
speak, and it is done. (2.) He does it effectually: He delivereth them
out of their destructions, that they shall neither be destroyed nor
distressed with the fear of being so. Nothing is too hard for that God
to do who kills and makes alive again, brings down to the grave and
raises up, who turneth man almost to destruction, and yet saith, Return.
2. When those that have been sick are restored they must return to God
an answer of praise ([Psa 107:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#021.md), [Psa
107:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#022).md): Let all men praise the Lord
for his goodness, and let those, particularly, to whom God has thus
granted a new life, spend it in his service; let them sacrifice with
thanksgiving, not only bring a thank-offering to the altar, but a
thankful heart to God. Thanksgivings are the best thank-offerings, and
shall please the Lord better than an ox or bullock. And let them declare
his works with rejoicing, to his honour and for the encouragement of
others. The living, the living, they shall praise him.

[Psalms 107:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 107:23</span></span>

The psalmist here calls upon those to give glory to God who are
delivered from dangers at sea. Though the Israelites dealt not much in
merchandise, yet their neighbours the Tyrians and Zidonians did, and for
them perhaps this part of the psalm was especially calculated.

I. Much of the power of God appears at all times in the sea, [Psa
107:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#023.md), [Psa
107:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#024.md). It appears to those that go
down to the sea in ships, as mariners, merchants, fishermen, or
passengers, that do business in great waters. And surely none will
expose themselves there but those that have business (among all
Solomon's pleasant things we do not read of any pleasure-boat he had),
but those that go on business, lawful business, may, in faith, put
themselves under the divine protection. These see the works of the Lord,
and his wonders, which are the more surprising, because most are born
and bred upon land, and what passes at sea is new to them. The deep
itself is a wonder, its vastness, its saltness, its ebbing and flowing.
The great variety of living creatures in the sea is wonderful. Let those
that go to sea be led, by all the wonders they observe there, to
consider and adore the infinite perfections of that God whose the sea
is, for he made it and manages it.

II\. It especially appears in storms at sea, which are much more
terrible than at land. Observe here, 1. How dangerous and dreadful a
tempest at sea is. Then wonders begin to appear in the deep, when God
commands and raises the strong wind, which fulfils his word, [Psa
148:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#008.md). He raises the winds, as a
prince by his commission raises forces. Satan pretends to be the prince
of the power of the air; but he is a pretender; the powers of the air
are at God's command, not at his. When the wind becomes stormy it lifts
up the waves of the sea, [Psa 107:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#025.md).
Then the ships are kicked like tennis-balls on the tops of the waves;
they seem to mount up to the heavens, and then they couch again, as if
they would go down to the depths, [Psa
107:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#026.md). A stranger, who had never seen
it, would not think it possible for a ship to live at sea, as it will in
a storm, and ride it out, but would expect that the next wave would bury
it and it would never come up again; and yet God, who taught man
discretion to make ships that should so strangely keep above water, does
by his special providence preserve them, that they answer the end to
admiration. When the ships are thus tossed the soul of the seaman melts
because of trouble; and, when the storm is very high, even those that
are used to the sea can neither shake off nor dissemble their fears, but
they reel to and fro, and tossing makes them giddy, and they stagger and
are sick, it may be, like a drunken man; the whole ship's crew are in
confusion and quite at their wits' end ([Psa
107:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#027).md), not knowing what to do more
for their preservation; all their wisdom is swallowed up, and they are
ready to give up themselves for gone, [Jon
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#005.md), etc. 2. How seasonable it is at
such a time to pray. Those that go to sea must expect such perils as are
here described, and the best preparation they can make for them is to
make sure a liberty of access to God by prayer, for then they will cry
unto the Lord, [Psa 107:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#028.md). We have a
saying, "Let those that would learn to pray go to sea;" I say, Let those
that will go to sea learn to pray, and accustom themselves to pray, that
they may come with the more boldness to the throne of grace when they
are in trouble. Even heathen mariners, in a storm, cried every man to
his god; but those that have the Lord for their God have a present and
powerful help in that and every other time of need, so that when they
are at their wits' end they are not at their faith's end. 3. How
wonderfully God sometimes appears for those that are in distress at sea,
in answer to their prayers: He brings them out of the danger; and, (1.)
The sea is still: He makes the storm a calm, [Psa
107:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#029.md). The winds fall, and only by
their soft and gentle murmurs serve to lull the waves asleep again, so
that the surface of the sea becomes smooth and smiling. By this Christ
proved himself to be more than a man that even the winds and the seas
obeyed him. (2.) The seamen are made easy: They are glad because they
are quiet, quiet from the noise, quiet from the fear of evil. Quietness
after a storm is a very desirable thing, and sensibly pleasant. (3.) The
voyage becomes prosperous and successful: So he brings them to their
desired haven, [Psa 107:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#030.md). Thus he
carries his people safely through all the storms and tempests that they
meet with in their voyage heaven-ward, and lands them, at length, in the
desired harbour. 4. How justly it is expected that all those who have
had a safe passage over the sea, and especially who have been delivered
from remarkable perils at sea, should acknowledge it with thankfulness,
to the glory of God. Let them do it privately in their closets and
families. Let them praise the Lord for his goodness to themselves and
others, [Psa 107:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#031.md). Let them do it
publicly ([Psa 107:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#032).md), in the
congregation of the people and in the assembly of the elders; there let
them erect the memorials of their deliverance, to the honour of God, and
for the encouragement of others to trust him.

[Psalms 107:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">psa 107:33</span></span>

The psalmist, having given God the glory of the providential reliefs
granted to persons in distress, here gives him the glory of the
revolutions of providence, and the surprising changes it sometimes makes
in the affairs of the children of men.

I. He gives some instances of these revolutions.

1\. Fruitful countries are made barren and barren countries are made
fruitful. Much of the comfort of this life depends upon the soil in
which our lot is cast. Now, (1.) The sin of man has often marred the
fruitfulness of the soil and made it unserviceable, [Psa
107:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#033.md), [Psa
107:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#034.md). Land watered with rivers is
sometimes turned into a wilderness, and that which had been full of
water-springs now has not so much as water-streams; it is turned into
dry and sandy ground, that has not consistency and moisture enough to
produce any thing valuable. Many a fruitful land is turned into
saltness, not so much from natural causes as from the just judgment of
God, who thus punished the wickedness of those that dwell therein; as
the vale of Sodom became a salt sea. Note, If the land be bad, it is
because the inhabitants are so. Justly is the ground made unfruitful to
those that bring not forth fruit unto God, but serve Baal with their
corn and wine. (2.) The goodness of God has often mended the barrenness
of the soil, and turned a wilderness, a land o drought, into
water-springs, [Psa 107:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#035.md). The land
of Canaan, which was once the glory of all lands for fruitfulness, is
said to be, at this day, a fruitless, useless, worthless spot of ground,
as was foretold, [Deu 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023.md). This land
of ours, which formerly was much of it an uncultivated desert, is now
full of all good things, and more abundant honour is given to that part
which lacked. Let the plantations in America, and the colonies settled
there, compared with the desolations of many countries in Asia and
Europe, that formerly were famous, expound this.

2\. Necessitous families are raised and enriched, while prosperous
families are impoverished and go to decay. If we look broad in the
world, (1.) We see many greatly increasing whose beginning was small,
and whose ancestors were mean and made no figure, [Psa
107:36-38](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#036.md). Those that were hungry are
made to dwell in fruitful lands; there they take root, and gain a
settlement, and prepare a city for habitation for themselves and theirs
after them. Providence puts good land under their hands, and they build
upon it. Cities took rise from rising families. But as lands, will not
serve for men without lodgings, and therefore they must prepare a city
of habitation, so lodgings, though ever so convenient, will not serve
without lands, and therefore they must sow the fields, and plant
vineyards ([Psa 107:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#037).md), for the king
himself is served of the field. And yet the fields, though favoured with
water-springs, will not yield fruits of increase, unless they be sown,
nor will vineyards be had, unless they be planted; man's industry must
attend God's blessing, and then God's blessing will crown man's
industry. The fruitfulness of the soil should engage, for it does
encourage, diligence; and, ordinarily, the hand of the diligent, by the
blessing of God, makes rich, [Psa
107:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#038.md). He blesses them also, so that
they are, in a little time, multiplied greatly, and he diminishes not
their cattle. As in the beginning, so still it is, by the blessing of
God, that the earth and all the creatures increase and multiply ([Gen
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#022).md), and we depend upon God for the
increase of the cattle as well as for the increase of the ground. Cattle
would decrease many ways if God should permit it, and men would soon
suffer by it. (2.) We see many that have thus suddenly risen as suddenly
sunk and brought to nothing ([Psa
107:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#039).md): Again they are diminished and
brought low by adverse providences, and end their days as low as they
began them; or their families after them lose as fast a they got, and
scatter what they heaped together. Note, Worldly wealth is an uncertain
thing, and often those that are filled with it, ere they are aware, grow
so secure and sensual with it that, ere they are aware, they lose it
again. Hence it is called deceitful riches and the mammon of
unrighteousness. God has many ways of making men poor; he can do it by
oppression, affliction, and sorrow, as he tempted Job and brought him
low.

3\. Those that were high and great in the world are abased, and those
that were mean and despicable are advanced to honour, [Psa
107:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#040.md), [Psa
107:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#041). We have seen, (1..md) Princes
dethroned and reduced to straits. He pours contempt upon them, even
among those that have idolized them. Those that exalt themselves God
will abase, and, in order thereunto, will infatuate: He makes them to
wander in the wilderness, where there is no way. He baffles those
counsels by which they thought to support themselves, and their own
power and pomp, and drives them headlong, so that they know not what
course to steer, nor what measures to take. We met with this before,
[Job 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#024.md), [Job
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#025). (2..md) Those of low degree
advanced to the posts of honour ([Psa
107:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#041).md): Yet setteth he the poor on
high, raiseth from the dust to the throne of glory, [Sa1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#008.md); [Psa
113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007.md), [Psa
113:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#008.md). Those that were afflicted and
trampled on are not only delivered, but set on high out of the reach of
their troubles, above their enemies, and have dominion over those to
whom they had been in subjection. That which adds to their honour, and
strengthens them in their elevation, is the multitude of their children:
He maketh him families like a flock of sheep, so numerous, so useful, so
sociable with one another, and so meek and peaceable. He that sent them
meat sent them mouths. Happy is the man that has his quiver filled with
arrows, for he shall boldly speak with the enemy in the gate, [Psa
127:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#005.md). God is to be acknowledged both
in setting up families and in building them up. Let not princes be
envied, nor the poor despised, for God has many ways of changing the
condition of both.

II\. He makes some improvement of these remarks; such surprising turns
as these are of use, 1. For the solacing of saints. They observe these
dispensations with pleasure ([Psa
107:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#042).md): The righteous shall see it
and rejoice in the glorifying of God's attributes and the manifesting of
his dominion over the children of men. It is a great comfort to a good
man to see how God manages the children of men, as the potter does the
clay, so as to serve his own purposes by them, to see despised virtue
advanced and impious pride brought low to the dust, to see it evinced
beyond dispute that verily there is a God that judges in the earth. 2.
For the silencing of sinners: All iniquity shall stop her mouth; it
shall be a full conviction of the folly of atheists, and of those that
deny the divine providence; and, forasmuch as practical atheism is at
the bottom of all sin, it shall in effect stop the mouth of all
iniquity. When sinners see how their punishment answers to their sin,
and how justly God deals with them in taking away from them those gifts
of his which they had abused, they shall not have one word to say for
themselves; for God will be justified, he will be clear. 3. For the
satisfying of all concerning the divine goodness ([Psa
107:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#043).md): Whoso is wise, and will
observe these things, these various dispensations of divine providence,
even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the Lord. Here is, (1.)
A desirable end proposed, and that is, rightly to understand the
lovingkindness of the Lord. It is of great use to us, in religion, to be
fully assured of God's goodness, to be experimentally acquainted and
duly affected with it, that his lovingkindness may be before our eyes,
[Psa 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#003). (2..md) A proper means
prescribed for attaining this end, and that is a due observance of God's
providence. We must lay up these things, mind them, and keep them in
mind, [Luk 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#019). (3..md) A commendation
of the use of this means as an instance of true wisdom: Whoso is wise,
let him by this both prove his wisdom and improve it. A prudent
observance of the providences of God will contribute very much to the
accomplishing of a good Christian.
