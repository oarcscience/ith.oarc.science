### [Leviticus Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 22:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have divers laws concerning the priests and
sacrifices all for the preserving of the honour of the sanctuary. I.
That the priests should not eat the holy things in their uncleanness
([Lev 22:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#001).md). II. That no stranger
who did not belong to some family of the priests should eat of the holy
things ([Lev 22:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#010).md), and, if he did
it unwittingly, he must make restitution, ([Lev
22:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#014).md). III. That the sacrifices
which were offered must be without blemish ([Lev
22:17-25](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#017).md). IV. That they must be more
than eight days old ([Lev 22:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#026).md),
and that the sacrifices of thanksgiving must be eaten the same day they
were offered ([Lev 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#029), etc..md).

[Leviticus 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 22:1</span></span>

Those that had a natural blemish, though they were forbidden to do the
priests' work, were yet allowed to eat of the holy things: and the
Jewish writers say that "to keep them from idleness they were employed
in the wood-room, to pick out that which was worm-eaten, that it might
not be used in the fire upon the altar; they might also be employed in
the judgment of leprosy:" but,

I. Those that were under any ceremonial uncleanness, which possibly they
contracted by their own fault, might no so much as eat of the holy
things while they continued in their pollution. 1. Some pollutions were
permanent, as a leprosy or a running issue, [Lev
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#004.md). These separated the people from
the sanctuary, and God would show that they were so far from being more
excusable that really they were more abominable in a priest. 2. Others
were more transient, as the touching of a dead body, or any thing else
that was unclean, from which, after a certain time, a man was cleansed
by bathing his flesh in water, [Lev
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#006.md). But whoever was thus defiled
might not eat of the holy things, under pain of God's highest
displeasure, who said, and ratified the saying, That soul shall be cut
off from my presence, [Lev 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#003.md). Our
being in the presence of God, and attending upon him, will be so far
from securing us that it will but the more expose us to God's wrath, if
we dare to draw nigh to him in our uncleanness. The destruction shall
come from the presence of the Lord ([Th2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009).md), as the fire by which Nadab and
Abihu died came from before the Lord. Thus those who profane the holy
word of God will be cut off by that word which they make so light of; it
shall condemn them. They are again warned of their danger if they eat
the holy thing in their uncleanness ([Lev
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#009).md), lest they bear sin, and die
therefore. Note, (1.) Those contract great guilt who profane sacred
things, by touching them with unhallowed hands. Eating the holy things
signified an interest in the atonement; but, if they ate of them in
their uncleanness, they were so far from lessening their guilt that they
increased it: They shall bear sin. (2.) Sin is a burden which, if
infinite mercy prevent not, will certainly sink those that bear it: They
shall die therefore. Even priests may be ruined by their pollutions and
presumptions.

II\. As to the design of this law we may observe, 1. This obliged the
priests carefully to preserve their purity, and to dread every thing
that would defile them. The holy things were their livelihood; if they
might not eat of them, how must they subsist? The more we have to lose
of comfort and honour by our defilement, the more careful we should be
to preserve our purity. 2. This impressed the people with a reverence
for the holy things, when they saw the priests themselves separated from
them (as the expression is, [Lev 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#002).md)
so long as they were in their uncleanness. He is doubtless a God of
infinite purity who kept his immediate attendants under so strict a
discipline. 3. This teaches us carefully to watch against all moral
pollutions, because by them we are unfitted to receive the comfort of
God's sanctuary. Though we labour not under habitual deformities, yet
actual defilements deprive us of the pleasure of communion with God; and
therefore he that is washed needeth to wash his feet ([Joh
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#010).md), to wash his hands, and so to
compass the altar, [Psa 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#006.md). Herein
we have need to be jealous over ourselves, lest (as it is observably
expressed here) we profane God's holy name in those things which we
hallow unto him, [Lev 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#002.md). If we
affront God in those very performances wherein we pretend to honour him,
and provoke him instead of pleasing him, we shall make up but a bad
account shortly; yet thus we do if we profane God's name, by doing that
in our uncleanness which pretends to be hallowed to him.

[Leviticus 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 22:10</span></span>

The holy things were to be eaten by the priests and their families. Now,

I. Here is a law that no stranger should eat of them, that is, no person
whatsoever but the priests only, and those that pertained to them, [Lev
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#010.md). The priests are charged with
this care, not to profane the holy things by permitting the strangers to
eat of them ([Lev 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#015).md) or suffer
them to bear the iniquity of trespass ([Lev
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#016).md); that is, suffer them to bring
guilt upon themselves, by meddling with that which they have no right
to. Thus it is commonly understood. Note, We must not only be careful
that we do not bear iniquity ourselves, but we must do what we can to
prevent others bearing it. We must not only not suffer sin to lie upon
our brother, but, if we can help it, we must not suffer it to come upon
him. But perhaps there is another meaning of those words: the priests'
eating the sin-offerings is said to signify their bearing the iniquity
of the congregation, to make an atonement for them, [Lev
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#017.md). Let not a stranger therefore
eat of that holy thing particularly, and so pretend to bear the iniquity
of trespass; for it is daring presumption for any to do that, but such
as are appointed to do it. Those that set up other mediators besides
Christ our priest, to bear the iniquity of trespass, sacrilegiously rob
Christ of his honour, and invade his rights. When we warn people not to
trust to their own righteousness, nor dare to appear before God in it,
but to rely on Christ's righteousness only for peace and pardon, it is
because we dare not suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, for we
know it is too heavy for them.

II\. Here is an explanation of the law, showing who were to be looked
upon as belonging to the priest's family, and who not. 1. Sojourners and
hired servants abode not in the house for ever; they were in the family,
but not of it; and therefore they might not eat of the holy things ([Lev
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#010).md): but the servant that was born
in the house or bought with money, being a heirloom to the family,
though a servant, yet might eat of the holy things, [Lev
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#011.md). Note, Those only are entitled
to the comforts of God's house who make it their rest for ever, and
resolve to dwell in it all the days of their life. As for those who for
a time only believe, to serve a present turn. They are looked upon but
as sojourners and mercenaries, and have no part nor lot in the matter.
2. As to the children of the family, concerning the sons there could be
no dispute, they were themselves priests, but concerning the daughters
there was a distinction. While they continued in their father's house
they might eat of the holy things; but, if they married such as were not
priests, they lost their right ([Lev
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#012).md), for now they were cut off from
the family of the priests. Yet if a priest's daughter became a widow,
and had no children in whom she might preserve a distinct family, and
returned to her father's house again, being neither wife nor mother, she
should again be looked upon as a daughter, and might eat of the holy
things. If those whom Providence has made sorrowful widows, and who are
dislodged from the rest they had in the house of a husband, yet find it
again in a father's house, they have reason to be thankful to the
widows' God, who does not leave them comfortless. 3. Here is a demand of
restitution to be made by him that had no right to the holy things, and
yet should eat of them unwittingly, [Lev
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#014.md). If he did it presumptuously,
and in contempt of the divine institution, he was liable to be cut off
by the hand of God, and to be beaten by the magistrate; but, if he did
it through weakness in inconsideration, he was to restore the value,
adding a fifth part to it, besides which he was to bring an offering to
atone for the trespass; see [Lev 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#015.md),
[Lev 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#016.md).

III\. This law might be dispensed with in a case of necessity, as it was
when David and his men ate of the show-bread, [Sa1
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#006.md). And our Saviour justifies them,
and gives a reason for it, which furnishes us with a lasting rule in all
such cases, that God will have mercy and not sacrifice, [Mat
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#003.md), [Mat
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#004.md), [Mat
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#007.md). Rituals must give way to morals.

IV\. It is an instruction to gospel ministers, who are stewards of the
mysteries of God, not to admit all, without distinction, to eat of the
holy things, but to take out the precious from the vile. Those that are
scandalously ignorant or profane are strangers and aliens to the family
of the Lord's priests; and it is not meet to take the children's bread
and to cast it to such. Holy things are for holy persons, for those who
are holy, at least, in profession, [Mat
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006.md).

[Leviticus 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 22:17</span></span>

Here are four laws concerning sacrifices: -

I. Whatever was offered in sacrifice to God should be without blemish,
otherwise it should not be accepted. This had often been mentioned in
the particular institutions of the several sorts of offerings. Now here
they are told what was to be accounted a blemish which rendered a beast
unfit for sacrifice: if it was blind, or lame, had a wen, or the mange
([Lev 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#022).md), - if it was bruised, or
crushed, or broken, or cut ([Lev
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#024).md), that is, as the Jewish writers
understand it, if it was, in any of these ways, castrated, if bulls and
rams were made into oxen and weathers, they might not be offered.
Moreover a difference is made between what was brought as a free-will
offering and what was brought as a vow, [Lev
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#023.md). And, though none that had any
of the forementioned blemishes might be brought for either, yet if a
beast had any thing superfluous or lacking (that is, as the Jews
understand it, if there was a disproportion or inequality between those
parts that are pairs, when one eye, or ear, or leg, was bigger than it
should be, or less than it should be) - if there was no other blemish
than this, it might be accepted for a free-will offering, to which a man
had not before laid himself, nor had the divine law laid him, under any
particular obligation; but for a vow it might not be accepted. Thus God
would teach us to make conscience of performing our promises to him very
exactly, and not afterwards to abate in quantity or value of what we had
solemnly engaged to devote to him. What was, before the vow, in our own
power, as in the case of a free-will offering, afterwards is not, [Act
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#004.md). It is again and again declared
that no sacrifice should be accepted if it was thus blemished, [Lev
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#020.md), [Lev
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#021.md). According to this law great
care was taken to search all the beasts that were brought to be
sacrificed, that there might, to a certainty, be no blemish in them. A
blemished sacrifice might not be accepted even from the hand of a
stranger, though to such all possible encouragement should be given to
do honour to the God of Israel, [Lev
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#025.md). By this it appears that
strangers were expected to come to the house of God from a far country
([Kg1 8:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#041.md), [Kg1
8:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#042).md), and that they should be
welcome, and their offerings accepted, as those of Darius, [Ezr
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#009.md), [Ezr
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#010.md); [Isa
56:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#006.md), [Isa
56:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#007.md). The heathen priests were many of
them not so strict in this matter, but would receive sacrifices for
their gods that were ever so scandalous; but let strangers know that the
God of Israel would not be so served. Now, 1. This law was then
necessary for the preserving of the honour of the sanctuary, and of the
God that was there worshipped. It was fit that every thing that was
employed for his honour should be the best of the kind; for, as he is
the greatest and brightest, so he is the best of beings; and he that is
the best must have the best. See how greatly and justly displeasing the
breach of this law was to the holy God, [Mal
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#008.md), [Mal
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#013.md), [Mal
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#014.md). 2. This law made all the legal
sacrifices the fitter to be types of Christ, the great sacrifice from
which all these derived their virtue. In allusion to this law, he is
said to be a Lamb without blemish and without spot, [Pe1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019.md). As such a priest, so such a
sacrifice, became us, who was harmless and undefiled. When Pilate
declared, I find no fault in this man, he did thereby in effect
pronounce the sacrifice without blemish. The Jews say it was the work of
the sagan, or suffragan, high priest, to view the sacrifices, and see
whether they were without blemish or no; when Christ suffered, Annas was
in that office; but little did those who brought Christ to Annas first,
by whom he was sent bound to Caiaphas, as a sacrifice fit to be offered
([Joh 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#013.md), [Joh
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#024).md), think that they were answering
the type of this law. 3. It is an instruction to us to offer to God the
best we have in our spiritual sacrifices. If our devotions are ignorant,
and cold, and trifling, and full of distractions, we offer the blind,
and the lame, and the sick, for sacrifice; but cursed be the deceiver
that does so, for, while he thinks to put a cheat upon God, he puts a
damning cheat upon his own soul.

II\. That no beast should be offered in sacrifice before it was eight
days old, [Lev 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#026.md), [Lev
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#027.md). It was provided before that the
firstlings of their cattle, which were to be dedicated to God, should
not be brought to him till after the eighth day, [Exo
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#030.md). Here it is provided that no
creature should be offered in sacrifice till it was eight days old
complete. Sooner than that it was not fit to be used at men's tables,
and therefore not a God's altar. The Jews say, "It was because the
sabbath sanctifies all things, and nothing should be offered to God till
at least one sabbath had passed over it." It was in conformity to the
law of circumcision, which children were to receive on the eighth day.
Christ was sacrificed for us, not in his infancy, though then Herod
sought to slay him, but in the prime of his time.

III\. That the dam and her young should not both be killed in one day,
whether in sacrifice or for common use, [Lev
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#028.md). There is such a law as this
concerning birds, [Deu 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#006.md). This was
forbidden, not as evil in itself, but because it looked barbarous and
cruel to the brute creatures; like the tyranny of the king of Babylon,
that slew Zedekiah's sons before his eyes, and then put out his eyes. It
looked ill-natured towards the species to kill two generations at once,
as if one designed the ruin of the kind.

IV\. That the flesh of their thank-offerings should be eaten on the same
day that they were sacrificed, [Lev
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#029.md), [Lev
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#030.md). This is a repetition of what we
had before, [Lev 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#015.md); [Lev
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#006.md), [Lev
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#007.md). The chapter concludes with such
a general charge as we have often met with, to keep God's commandments,
and not to profane his holy name, [Lev
22:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#031.md), [Lev
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#032.md). Those that profess God's name,
if they do not make conscience of keeping his commandments, do but
profane his name. The general reasons are added: God's authority over
them - I am the Lord; his interest in them - I am your God; the title he
had to them by redemption - "I brought you out of the land of Egypt, on
purpose that I might be your God;" the designs of his grace concerning
them - I am the Lord that hallow you; and the resolutions of his
justice, if he had not honour from them, to get himself honour upon them
- I will be hallowed among the children of Israel. God will be a loser
in his glory by no man at last; but sooner or later will recover his
right, either in the repentance of sinners or in their ruin.
