### [Numbers Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 20:0</span></span>

At this chapter begins the history of the fortieth year (which was the
last year) of the Israelites' wandering in the wilderness. And since the
beginning of their second year, when they were sentenced to perform
their quarantine in the desert, there to wear away the tedious
revolution of forty years, there is little recorded concerning them till
this last year, which brought them to the borders of Canaan, and the
history of this year is almost as large as the history of the first
year. This chapter gives an account of, I. The death of Miriam ([Num
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001).md). II. The fetching of water out
of the rock, in which observe, 1. The distress Israel was in, for want
of water ([Num 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#002).md). 2. Their
discontent and murmuring in that distress ([Num
20:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#003).md). 3. God's pity and power
engaged for their supply with water out of the rock ([Num
20:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#006).md). 4. The infirmity of Moses and
Aaron upon this occasion ([Num 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#010.md),
[Num 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#011).md). 5. God's displeasure
against them ([Num 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#012.md), [Num
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#013).md). III. The negotiation with the
Edomites. Israel's request ([Num
20:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#014).md), and the repulse the
Edomites gave them ([Num 20:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#018).md).
IV. The death of Aaron the high priest upon Mount Hor, the instalment of
Eleazar in his room, and the people's mourning for him ([Num
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#022), etc..md).

[Numbers 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 20:1</span></span>

After thirty-eight years' tedious marches, or rather tedious rests, in
the wilderness, backward towards the Red Sea, the armies of Israel now
at length set their faces towards Canaan again, and had come not far off
from the place where they were when, by the righteous sentence of divine
Justice, they were made to begin their wanderings. Hitherto they had
been led about as in a maze or labyrinth, while execution was doing upon
the rebels that were sentenced; but they were now brought into the right
way again: they abode in Kadesh ([Num
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001).md), not Kadesh-barnea, which was
near the borders of Canaan, but another Kadesh on the confines of Edom,
further off from the land of promise, yet in the way to it from the Red
Sea, to which they had been hurried back. Now,

I. Here dies Miriam, the sister of Moses and Aaron, and as it should
seem older than either of them. She must have been so if she was that
sister that was set to watch Moses when he was put into the ark of
bulrushes, [Exo 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#004.md). Miriam died
there, [Exo 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#001.md). She was a prophetess,
and had been an instrument of much good to Israel, [Mic
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#004.md). When Moses and Aaron with their
rod went before them, to work wonders for them, Miriam with her timbrel
went before them in praising God for these wondrous works ([Exo
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020).md), and therein did them real
service; yet she had once been a murmurer ([Num
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#001).md), and must not enter Canaan.

II\. Here there is another Meribah. one place we met with before of that
name, in the beginning of their march through the wilderness, which was
so called because of the chiding of the children of Israel, [Exo
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#007.md). And now we have another place,
at the latter end of their march, which bears the same name for the same
reason: This is the water of Meribah, [Num
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#013.md). What was there done was here
re-acted.

1\. There was no water for the congregation, [Num
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#002.md). The water out of the rock of
Rephidim had followed them while there was need of it; but it is
probable that for some time they had been in a country where they were
supplied in an ordinary way, and when common providence supplied them it
was fit that the miracle should cease. But in this place it fell out
that there was no water, or not sufficient for the congregation. Note,
We live in a wanting world, and, wherever we are, must expect to meet
with some inconvenience or other. It is a great mercy to have plenty of
water, a mercy which if we found the want of we should own the worth of.

2\. Hereupon they murmured, mutinied ([Num
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#002).md), gathered themselves together,
and took up arms against Moses and Aaron. They chid with them ([Num
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#003).md), spoke the same absurd and
brutish language that their fathers had done before them. (1.) They
wished they had died as malefactors by the hands of divine justice,
rather than thus seem for a while neglected by the divine mercy: Would
God that we had died when our brethren died before the Lord! Instead of
giving God thanks, as they ought to have done, for sparing them, they
not only despise the mercy of their reprieve, but quarrel with it, as if
God had done them a great deal of wrong in giving them their lives for a
prey, and snatching them as brands out of the burning. But they need not
wish that they had died with their brethren, they are here taking the
ready way to die like their brethren in a little while. Woe unto those
that desire the day of the Lord, [Amo
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018). (2..md) They were angry that they
were brought out of Egypt, and led through this wilderness, [Num
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#004.md), [Num
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#005.md). They quarrelled with Moses for
that which they knew was the Lord's doing; they represented that as an
injury which was the greatest favour that ever was done to any people.
They prefer slavery before liberty, the house of bondage before the land
of promise; and though, the present want was of water only, yet, now
that they are disposed to find fault, it shall be looked upon as an
insufferable hardship put upon them that they have not vines and figs.
It was an aggravation of their crime, \[1.\] that they had smarted so
long for the discontents and distrusts of their fathers. They had borne
their whoredoms now almost forty years in the wilderness ([Num
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#033).md); and yet they ventured in the
same steps, and, as is charged upon Belshazzar, humbled not their
hearts, though they knew all this, [Dan
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#022.md). \[2.\] That they had had such
long and constant experience of God's goodness to them, and of the
tenderness and faithfulness of Moses and Aaron. \[3.\] That Miriam was
now lately dead; and, having lost one of their leaders, they ought to
have been more respectful to those that were left; but, as if they were
resolved to provoke God to leave them as sheep without any shepherd,
they grow outrageous against them: instead of condoling with Moses and
Aaron for the death of their sister, they add affliction to their grief.

3\. Moses and Aaron made them no reply, but retired to the door of the
tabernacle to know God's mind in this case, [Num
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#006.md). There they fell on their faces,
as formerly on the like occasion, to deprecate the wrath of God and to
entreat direction from him. Here is no mention of any thing they said;
they knew that God heard the murmurings of the people, and before him
they humbly prostrate themselves, making intercessions with groanings
that cannot be uttered. There they lay waiting for orders Speak, Lord,
for thy servants hear.

4\. God appeared, to determine the matter; not on his tribunal of
justice, to sentence the rebels according to their deserts; no, he will
not return to destroy Ephraim ([Hos
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009).md), will not always chide; see [Gen
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021). But he appeared, (1..md) On his
throne of glory, to silence their unjust murmuring ([Num
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#006).md): The glory of the Lord appeared,
to still the tumult of the people, by striking an awe upon them. Note, A
believing sight of the glory of the Lord would be an effectual check to
our lusts and passions, and would keep our mouths as with a bridle. (2.)
On his throne of grace, to satisfy their just desires. It was requisite
that they should have water, and therefore, thought the manner of their
petitioning for it was irregular and disorderly, yet God did not take
that advantage against them to deny it to them, but gave immediate
orders for their supply, [Num 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#008.md).
Moses must a second time in God's name command water out of a rock for
them, to show that God is as able as ever to supply his people with good
things, even in their greatest straits an in the utmost failure of
second causes. Almighty power can bring water out of a rock, has done
it, and can again, for his arm is not shortened. Lest it should be
thought that there was something peculiar in the former rock itself,
some secret spring which nature hid before in it, God here bids him
broach another, and does not, as then, direct him which he must apply
to, but lets him make use of which he pleased, or the first he came to;
all alike to Omnipotence. \[1.\] God bids him take the rod, that famous
rod with which he summoned the plagues of Egypt, and divided the sea,
that, having that in his hand, both he and the people might be reminded
of the great things God had formerly done for them, and might be
encouraged to trust in him now. This rod, it seems, was kept in the
tabernacle ([Num 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#009).md), for it was the
rod of God, the rod of his strength, as the gospel is called ([Psa
110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002).md), perhaps in allusion to it.
\[2.\] God bids him gather the assembly, not the elders only, but the
people, to be witnesses of what was done, that by their own eyes they
might be convinced and made ashamed of their unbelief. There is no
fallacy in God's works of wonder, and therefore they shun not the light,
nor the inspection and enquiry of many witnesses. \[3.\] He bids him
speak to the rock, which would do as it was bidden, to shame the people
who had been so often spoken to, and would not hear nor obey. Their
hearts were harder than this rock, not so tender, not so yielding, not
so obedient. \[4.\] He promises that the rock should give forth water
([Num 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#008).md), and it did so ([Num
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#011).md): The water came out abundantly.
This is an instance, not only of the power of God, that he could thus
fetch honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock, but of his
mercy and grace, that he would do it for such a provoking people. This
was a new generation (most of the old stock were by this time worn off),
yet they were as bad as those that went before them; murmuring ran in
the blood, yet the entail of the divine favour was not cut off, but in
this instance of it the divine patience shines as brightly as the divine
power. He is God and not man, in sparing and pardoning; nay, he not only
here gave them the drink which they drank of in common with their beasts
([Num 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#008.md), [Num
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#011).md), but in it he made them to
drink spiritual drink, which typified spiritual blessings, for that rock
was Christ.

5\. Moses and Aaron acted improperly in the management of this matter,
so much so that God in displeasure told them immediately that they
should not have the honour of bringing Israel into Canaan, [Num
20:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#010.md).

(1.) This is a strange passage of story, yet very instructive. \[1.\] It
is certain that God was greatly offended, and justly, for he is never
angry without cause. Though they were his servants, and had obtained
mercy to be faithful, though they were his favourites, and such as he
had highly honoured, yet for something they thought, or said, or did,
upon this occasion, he put them under the disgrace and mortification of
dying, as other unbelieving Israelites did, short of Canaan. And no
doubt the crime deserved the punishment. \[2.\] Yet it is uncertain what
it was in this management that was so provoking to God. The fault was
complicated. First, They did not punctually observe their orders, but in
some things varied from their commission; God bade them speak to the
rock, and they spoke to the people, and smote the rock, which at this
time they were not ordered to do, but they thought speaking would not
do. When, in distrust of the power of the word, we have recourse to the
secular power in matters of pure conscience, we do, as Moses here, smite
the rock to which we should only speak, Secondly, They assumed too much
of the glory of this work of wonder to themselves: Must we fetch water?
as if it were done by some power or worthiness of theirs. Therefore it
is charged upon them ([Num 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#012).md) that
they did not sanctify God, that is, they did not give him that glory of
this miracle which was due unto his name. Thirdly, Unbelief was the
great transgression ([Num 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#012).md): You
believed me not; nay, it is called rebelling against God's commandment,
[Num 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#014.md). The command was to bring
water out of the rock, but they rebelled against this command, by
distrusting it, and doubting whether it would take effect or no. They
speak doubtfully: Must we fetch water? And probably they did in some
other ways discover an uncertainty in their own minds whether water
would come or no for such a rebellious generation as this was. And
perhaps they the rather questioned it, though God had promised it,
because the glory of the Lord did not appear before them upon this rock,
as it had done upon the rock in Rephidim, [Exo
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006.md). They would not take God's word
without a sign. Dr. Lightfoot's notion of their unbelief is that they
doubted whether now at last, when the forty years had expired, they
should enter Canaan, and whether they must not for the murmurings of the
people be condemned to another period of toil, because a new rock was
now opened for their supply, which they took for an indication of their
longer stay. And, if so, justly were they kept out of Canaan themselves,
while the people entered at the time appointed. Fourthly, They said and
did all in heat and passion; this is the account given of the sin ([Psa
106:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#033).md): They provoked his spirit, so
that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips. It was in his passion that he
called them rebels. It is true they were so; God had called them so; and
Moses afterwards, in the way of a just reproof ([Deu
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#024).md), calls them so without offence;
but now it came from a provoked spirit, and was spoken unadvisedly: it
was too much like Raca, and Thou fool. His smiting the rock twice (it
should seem, not waiting at all for the eruption of the water upon the
first stroke) shows that he was in a heat. The same thing said and done
with meekness may be justifiable which when said and done in anger may
be highly culpable; see [Jam 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#020.md).
Fifthly, That which aggravated all the rest, and made it the more
provoking, was that it was public, before the eyes of the children of
Israel, to whom they should have been examples of faith, and hope, and
meekness. We find Moses guilty of sinful distrust, [Num
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#022.md), [Num
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#023.md). That was private between God
and him, and therefore was only checked. But his was public; it
dishonoured God before Israel, as if he grudged them his favours, and
discouraged the people's hope in God, and therefore this was severely
punished, and the more because of the dignity and eminency of those that
offended.

(2.) From the whole we may learn, \[1.\] That the best of men have their
failings, even in those graces that they are most eminent for. The man
Moses was very meek, and yet here he sinned in passion; wherefore let
him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall. \[2.\] That God judges
not as man judges concerning sins; we might think that there was not
much amiss in what Moses said and did, yet God saw cause to animadvert
severely upon it. He knows the frame of men's spirits, what temper they
are of, and what temper they are in upon particular occasions, and from
what thoughts and intents words and actions do proceed; and we are sure
that therefore his judgment is according to truth, when it agrees not
with ours. \[3.\] that God not only takes notice of, and is displeased
with, the sins of his people, but that the nearer any are to him the
more offensive are their sins, [Amo
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#002.md). It should seem, the Psalmist
refers to this sin of Moses and Aaron ([Psa
99:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#008).md): Thou wast a God that forgavest
them, though thou tookest vengeance on their inventions. As many are
spared in this life and punished in the other, so many are punished in
this life and saved in the other. \[4.\] That, when our heart is hot
within us, we are concerned to take heed that we offend not with our
tongue. Yet, \[5.\] It is an evidence of the sincerity of Moses, and his
impartiality in writing, that he himself left this upon record
concerning himself, and drew not a veil over his own infirmity, by which
it appeared that in what he wrote, as well as what he did, he sought
God's glory more than his own.

Lastly, The place is hereupon called Meribah, [Num
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#013.md). It is called Meribah-Kadesh
([Deu 32:51](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#051).md), to distinguish it from
the other Meribah. It is the water of strife; to perpetuate the
remembrance of the people's sin, and Moses's, and yet of God's mercy,
who supplied them with water, and owned and honoured Moses
notwithstanding. Thus he was sanctified in the, as the Holy One of
Israel, so he is called when his mercy rejoices against judgment, [Hos
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009.md). Moses and Aaron did not sanctify
God as they ought in the eyes of Israel ([Num
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#012).md), but God was sanctified in
them; for he will not be a loser in his honour by any man. If he be not
glorified by us, he will be glorified upon us.

[Numbers 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 20:14</span></span>

We have here the application made by Israel to the Edomites. The nearest
way to Canaan from the place where Israel now lay encamped was through
the country of Edom. Now,

I. Moses sends ambassadors to treat with the king of Edom for leave to
pass through his country, and gives them instructions what to say, [Num
20:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#014.md). 1. They are to claim kindred
with the Edomites: Thus saith thy brother Israel. Both nations descended
from Abraham and Isaac, their common ancestors; Esau and Jacob, the two
fathers of their respective nations, were twin-brothers; and therefore,
for relation-sake, they might reasonably expect this kindness from them;
nor needed the Edomites to fear that their brother Israel had any ill
design upon them, or would take any advantages against them. 2. They are
to give a short account of the history and present state of Israel,
which, they take it for granted, the Edomites were no strangers to. And
in this there was a double plea: - (1.) Israel had been abused by the
Egyptians, and therefore ought to be pitied and succoured by their
relations: "The Egyptians vexed us and our fathers, but we may hope our
brethren the Edomites will not be so vexatious." (2.) Israel had been
wonderfully saved by the Lord, and therefore ought to be countenanced
and favoured ([Num 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#016).md): "We cried
unto the Lord, and he sent an angel, the angel of his presence, the
angel of the covenant, the eternal Word, who had brought us forth out of
Egypt, and led us hither." It was therefore the interest of the Edomites
to ingratiate themselves with a people that had so great an interest in
heaven and were so much its favourites, and it was at their peril if
they offered them any injury. It is our wisdom and duty to be kind to
those whom God is pleased to own, and to take his people for our people.
Come in, thou blessed of the Lord. 3. They are humbly to beg a passport
through their country. Though God himself, in the pillar of cloud and
fire, was Israel's guide, in following which they might have justified
their passing through any man's ground against all the world, yet God
would have this respect paid to the Edomites, to show that no man's
property ought to be invaded under colour of religion. Dominion is
founded in providence, not in grace. Thus when Christ was to pass
through a village of the Samaritans, to whom his coming was likely to be
offensive, he sent messengers before his face to ask leave, [Luk
9:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#052.md). Those that would receive
kindness must not disdain to request it. 4. They are to give security
for the good behaviour of the Israelites in this march, that they would
keep in the king's high road, that they would commit no trespass upon
any man's property, either in ground or water, that they would not so
much as make use of a well without paying for it, and that they would
make all convenient speed, as fast as they could well go on their feet,
[Num 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#017.md), [Num
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#019.md). Nothing could be offered more
fair and neighbourly.

II\. The ambassadors returned with a denial, [Num
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#018.md). Edom, that is, the king of
Edom, as protector of his country, said, Thou shalt not pass by me; and,
when the ambassadors urged it further, he repeated the denial ([Num
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#020).md) and threatened, if they offered
to enter his country, it should be at their peril; he raised his trained
bands to oppose them. Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage. This was
owing, 1. To their jealousy of the Israelites; they feared they should
receive promises. And truly, had this numerous army been under any other
discipline and command than that of the righteous God himself, who would
no more suffer them to do wrong than to take wrong, there might have
been cause for this jealousy; but what could they fear from a nation
that had statutes and judgments so righteous? 2. It was owing to the old
enmity which Esau bore to Israel. If they had no reason to fear damage
by them, yet they were not willing to show so much kindness to them.
Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing, and now the hatred revived,
when the blessing was ready to be inherited. God would hereby discover
the ill-nature of the Edomites to their shame, and try the good-nature
of the Israelites to their honour: they turned away from him, and did
not take this occasion to quarrel with him. Note, We must not think it
strange if the most reasonable requests be denied by unreasonable men,
and if those be affronted by men whom God favours. I as a deaf man heard
not. After this indignity which the Edomites offered to Israel God gave
them a particular caution not to abhor an Edomite ([Deu
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#007).md), though the Edomites had shown
such an abhorrence of them, to teach us in such cases not to meditate
revenge.

[Numbers 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 20:22</span></span>

The chapter began with the funeral of Miriam, and it ends with the
funeral of her brother Aaron. When death comes into a family, it often
strikes double. Israel had not improved the former affliction they were
under, by the death of the prophetess, and therefore, soon after, God
took away their priest, to try if they would lay that to heart. This
happened at the very next stage, when they removed to Mount Hor,
fetching a compass round the Edomites' country, leaving it on their left
hand. Wherever we go, death attends us, and the graves are ready for us.

I. God bids Aaron die, [Num 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#024.md). God
takes Moses and Aaron aside, and tells them, Aaron shall be gathered to
his people. These two dear brothers are told that they must part. Aaron
the elder must die first, but Moses is not likely to be long after him;
so that it is but for a while, a little while, that they are parted. 1.
There is something of displeasure in these orders. Aaron must not enter
Canaan, because he had failed in his duty at the waters of strife. The
mention of this, no doubt, went to the heart of Moses, who knew himself,
perhaps, at that time, to be the guiltier of the two. 2. There is much
of mercy in them. Aaron, though he dies for his transgression, is not
put to death as a malefactor, by a plague, or fire from heaven, but dies
with ease and in honour. He is not cut off from his people, as the
expression usually is concerning those that die by the hand of divine
justice, but he is gathered to his people, as one that died in the arms
of divine grace. 3. There is much of type and significancy in them.
Aaron must not enter Canaan, to show that the Levitical priesthood could
make nothing perfect: that must be done by the bringing in of a better
hope. Those priests could not continue by reason of sin and death, but
the priesthood of Christ, being undefiled, is unchangeable, and to this,
which abides for ever, Aaron must resign all his honour, [Heb
7:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#023.md).

II\. Aaron submits, and dies in the method and manner appointed, and,
for aught that appears, with as much cheerfulness as if he had been
going to bed.

1\. He puts on his holy garments to take his leave of them, and goes up
with his brother and son to the top of Mount Hor, and probably some of
the elders of Israel with him, [Num
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#027.md). They went up in the sight of
all the congregation, who, it is likely, were told on what errand they
went up; by this solemn procession Aaron lets Israel know that he is
neither afraid nor ashamed to die, but, when the bridegroom comes, can
trim his lamp and go forth to meet him. His going up the hill to die
signified that the death of saints (and Aaron is called the saint of the
Lord) is their ascension; they rather go up than go down to death.

2\. Moses, whose hands had first clothed Aaron with his priestly
garments, now strips him of them; for, in reverence to the priesthood,
it was not fit that he should die in them. Note, Death will strip us;
naked we came into the world, and naked we must go out. We shall see
little reason to be proud of our clothes, our ornaments, or marks of
honour, if we consider how soon death will strip us of our glory, divest
us of all our offices and honours, and take the crown off from our head.

3\. Moses immediately puts the priestly garments upon Eleazar his son,
clothes him with his father's robe, and strengthens him with his girdle,
[Isa 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#021). Now, (1..md) This was a great
comfort to Moses, by whose hand the law of the priesthood was given to
see that it should be kept up in a succession, and that a lamp was
ordained for the anointed, which should not be extinguished by death
itself. This was a happy earnest and indication to the church of the
care God would take that as one generation of ministers and Christians
(spiritual priests) passes away another generation should come up
instead of it. (2.) It was a great satisfaction to Aaron to see his son,
who was dear to him, thus preferred, and his office, which was dearer,
thus preserved and secured, and especially to see in this a figure of
Christ's everlasting priesthood, in which alone his would be
perpetuated. Now, Lord, might Aaron say, let thy servant depart in
peace, for my eyes have seen thy salvation. (3.) It was a great kindness
to the people. The installing of Eleazar before Aaron was dead would
prevent those who bore ill-will to Aaron's family from attempting to set
up another upon his death, in competition with his son. What could they
do when the matter was already settled? It would likewise encourage
those among them that feared God, and be a token for good to them, that
he would not leave them, nor suffer his faithfulness to fail.

4\. Aaron died there. Quickly after he was stripped of his priestly
garments, he laid himself down and died contentedly; for a good man
would desire, if it were the will of God, not to outlive his usefulness.
Why should we covet to continue any longer in this world than while we
may do God and our generation some service in it?

5\. Moses and Eleazar, with those that attended them, buried Aaron where
he died, as appears by [Deu 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#006.md), and
then came down from the mount. And now, when they came down, and had
left Aaron behind, it might be proper for them to think that he had
rather gone up to the better world and had left them behind.

6\. All the congregation mourned for Aaron thirty days, [Num
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#029.md). Though the loss was well made
up in Eleazar, who, being in the prime of life, was fitter from public
service that Aaron would have been if he had lived, yet it was a debt
owing to their deceased high priest to mourn for him. While he lived,
they were murmuring at him upon all occasions, but now that he was dead
they mourned for him. Thus many are taught to lament the loss of those
mercies which they would not learn to be thankful for the enjoyment of.
Many good men have had more honour done to their memories than ever they
had to their persons, witness those that were persecuted while they
lived, but when they were dead had their sepulchres garnished.
