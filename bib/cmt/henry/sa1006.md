### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 6:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have the return of the ark to the land of Israel,
whither we are now gladly to attend it, and observe, I. How the
Philistines dismissed it, by the advice of their priests ([Sa1
6:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#001).md), with rich presents to the God
of Israel, to make an atonement for their sin ([Sa1
6:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#003).md), and yet with a project to
bring it back, unless Providence directed the kine, contrary to their
inclination, to go to the land of Israel ([Sa1
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#008.md), [Sa1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#009).md). II. How the Israelites
entertained it. 1. With great joy and sacrifices of praise ([Sa1
6:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#012).md). 2. With an over-bold
curiosity to look into it, for which many of them were struck dead, the
terror of which moved them to send it forward to another city ([Sa1
6:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#019).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 6:1</span></span>

The first words of the chapter tell us how long the captivity of the ark
continued - it was in the country of the Philistines seven months. In
the field of the Philistines (so it is in the original), from which some
gather that, having tried it in all their cities, and found it a plague
to the inhabitants of each, at length they sent it into the open fields,
upon which mice sprang up out of the ground in great multitudes, and
destroyed the corn which was now nearly ripe and marred the land. With
that judgment they were plagued ([Sa1
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#005).md), and yet it is not mentioned in
the foregoing chapter; so God let them know that wherever they carried
the ark, so long as they carried it captive, they should find it a curse
to them. Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed in the field, [Deu
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#016.md). But, most take it to signify,
as we render it, The country of the Philistines. Now, 1. Seven months
Israel was punished with the absence of the ark, that special token of
God's presence. How bare did the tabernacle look without it! How was the
holy city now a desolation, and the holy land a wilderness! A melancholy
time no doubt it was to the good people among them, particularly to
Samuel; but they had this to comfort themselves with, as we have in the
like distress when we are deprived of the comfort of public ordinances,
that, wherever the ark is, the Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord's
throne is in heaven, and by faith and prayer we may have access with
boldness to him there. We may have God nigh unto us when the ark is at a
distance. 2. Seven months the Philistines were punished with the
presence of the ark; so long it was a plague to them, because they would
not send it home sooner. Note, Sinners lengthen out their own miseries
by obstinately refusing to part with their sins. Egypt's plagues would
have been fewer than ten if Pharaoh's heart had not been hardened not to
let the people go. But at length it is determined that the ark must be
sent back; there is no remedy, they are undone if they detain it.

I. The priests and the diviners are consulted about it, [Sa1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#002.md). They were supposed to be best
acquainted both with the rules of wisdom and with the rites of worship
and atonement. And the Israelites being their neighbours, and famed
above all people for the institutions of their religion, they had no
doubt the curiosity to acquaint themselves with their laws and usages;
and therefore it was proper to ask them, What shall we do to the ark of
Jehovah? All nations have had a regard to their priests, as the men
whose lips keep knowledge. Had the Philistines diviners? We have
divines, of whom we should enquire wherewith we shall come before the
Lord and bow ourselves before the most high God.

II\. They give their advice very fully, and seem to be very unanimous in
it. It was a wonder they did not, as friends to their country, give it,
ex officio - officially, before they were asked. 1. They urge it upon
them that it was absolutely necessary to send the ark back, from the
example of Pharaoh and the Egyptians, [Sa1
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#006.md). Some, it may be, were loth to
yield, and were willing to try it out with the ark awhile longer, and to
them they apply themselves: Wherefore do you harden your hearts, as the
Egyptians and Pharaoh did? It seems they were well acquainted with the
Mosaic history, and could cite precedents out of it. This good use we
should make of the remaining records of God's judgments upon obstinate
sinners, we should by them be warned not to harden our hearts as they
did. It is much cheaper to learn by other people's experience than by
our own. The Egyptians were forced at last to let Israel go; therefore
let the Philistines yield in time to let the ark go. 2. They advise
that, when they sent it back, they should send a trespass-offering with
it, [Sa1 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#003.md). Whatever the gods of
other nations were, they knew the God of Israel was a jealous God, and
how strict he was in his demands of sin-offerings and trespass-offerings
from his own people; and therefore, since they found how highly he
resented the affront of holding his ark captive, those with whom he had
such a quarrel must in any wise return him a trespass-offering, and they
could not expect to be healed upon any other terms. Injured justice
demands satisfaction. So far natural light instructed men. But when they
began to contrive what that satisfaction should be, they became
wretchedly vain in their imaginations. But those who by wilful sin have
imprisoned the truth in unrighteousness, as the Philistines did the ark
([Rom 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018).md), may conclude that there
is no making their peace with him whom they have thus injured but by a
sin-offering; and we know but one that can take away sin. 3. They direct
that this trespass-offering should be an acknowledgement of the
punishment of their iniquity, by which they might take shame to
themselves as conquered and yielding, and guilty before God, and might
give glory to the God of Israel as their mighty conqueror and most just
avenger, [Sa1 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#005.md). They must make
images of the emerods, that is, of the swellings and sores with which
they had been afflicted, so making the reproach of that shameful disease
perpetual by their own act and deed ([Psa
78:66](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#066).md), also images of the mice that
had marred the land, owning thereby the almighty power of the God of
Israel, who could chastise and humble them, even in the day of their
triumph, by such small and despicable animals. These images must be made
of gold, the most precious metal, to intimate that they would gladly
purchase their peace with the God of Israel at any rate, and would not
think it bought too dearly with gold, with much fine gold. The golden
emerods must be, in number, five, according to the number of the lords,
who, it is likely, were all afflicted with them, and were content thus
to own it; it was advised that the golden mice should be five too, but,
because the whole country was infested with them, it should seem, upon
second thoughts, they sent more of them, according to the number both of
the fenced cities and of the country villages, [Sa1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#018.md). Their priests reminded them that
one plague was on them all; they could not blame one another, for they
were all guilty, which they were plainly told by being all plagued.
Their proposal to offer a trespass-offering for their offence was
conformable enough to divine revelation at that time; but to send such
things as these for trespass-offerings was very foreign, and showed them
grossly ignorant of the methods of reconciliation appointed by the law
of Moses; for there it appears all along that it is blood, and not gold,
that makes atonement for the soul. 4. They encourage them to hope that
hereby they would take an effectual course to get rid of the plague: You
shall be healed, [Sa1 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#003.md). For, it
seems, the disease obstinately resisted all the methods of cure their
physicians had prescribed. "Let them therefore send back the ark, and
then," say they, "It shall be known to you why his hand is not removed
from you, that is, by this it will appear whether it is for your
detaining the ark that you are thus plagued; for, if it be, upon your
delivering it up the plague will cease." God has sometimes put his
people upon making such a trial, whether their reformation would not be
their relief. Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, [Mal
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#010.md); [Hag
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#018.md), [Hag
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#019.md). Yet they speak doubtfully ([Sa1
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#005).md): Peradventure he will lighten his
hand from off you; as if now they began to think that the judgment might
come from God's hand, and yet not be removed immediately upon the
restitution of the ark; however that was the likeliest way to obtain
mercy. Take away the cause and the effect will cease. 5. Yet they put
them in a way to make a further trial whether it was the hand of the God
of Israel that had smitten them with these plagues or no. They must, in
honour of the ark, put it on a new cart or carriage, to be drawn by two
milch-cows, that had calves daily sucking them ([Sa1
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#007).md), unused to draw, and inclined to
home, both for the sake of the crib where they were fed and of the
calves they nourished, and, besides, altogether unacquainted with the
road that led towards the land of Israel. They must have no one to lead
or drive them, but must take their own way, which, in all reason, one
might expect, would be home again; and yet, unless the God of Israel,
after all the other miracles he has wrought, will work one more, and by
an invisible power lead these cows, contrary to their natural instinct
and inclination, to the land of Israel, and particularly to
Beth-shemesh, they will retract their former opinion, and will believe
it was not the hand of God that smote them, but it was a chance that
happened to them, [Sa1 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#008.md), [Sa1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#009.md). Thus did God suffer himself to be
tempted and prescribed to, after he had been otherwise affronted, by
these uncircumcised Philistines. Would they have been content that the
honour of Dagon, their god, should be put upon such an issue as this?
See how willing bad men are to shift off their convictions of the hand
of God upon them, and to believe, when they are in trouble, that it is a
chance that happens to them; and, if so, the rod has no voice which they
are concerned to hear or heed.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 6:10</span></span>

We are here told,

I. How the Philistines dismissed the ark, [Sa1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#010.md), [Sa1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#011.md). They were made as glad to part
with it as ever they had been to take it. As God had fetched Israel out
of the house of bondage, so now he fetched the ark out of its captivity,
in such a manner as that Egypt was glad when they departed, [Psa
105:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#038.md). 1. They received no money or
price for the ransom of it, as they hoped to do, even beyond a king's
ransom. Thus it is prophesied of Cyrus ([Isa
45:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013).md), He shall let go my captives,
not for price nor reward. Nay, 2. They gave jewels of gold, as the
Egyptians did to the Israelites, to be rid of it. Thus the ark that was
carried into the land of the Philistines, a trophy of their victory,
carried back with it trophies of its own, and lasting monuments of the
disgrace of the Philistines. Note, God will be no loser in his glory, at
last, by the successes of the church's enemies against his ark, but will
get himself honour from those that seek to do dishonour to him.

II\. How the kine brought it to the land of Israel, [Sa1
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#012.md). They took the straight way to
Beth-shemesh, the next city of the land of Israel, and a priests' city,
and turned not aside. This was a wonderful instance of the power of God
over the brute-creatures, and, all things considered, no less than a
miracle, that cattle unaccustomed to the yoke should draw so even, so
orderly, and still go forward, - that, without any driver, they should
go from home, to which all tame creatures have a natural inclination,
and from their own calves, to which they had a natural affection, -
that, without any director, they should go the straight road to
Beth-shemesh, a city eight or ten miles off, never miss the way, never
turn aside into the fields to feed themselves, nor turn back home to
feed their calves. They went on lowing for their young ones, by which it
appeared that they had not forgotten them, but that nature was sensible
of the grievance of going from them; the power of the God of nature
therefore appeared so much the greater, in overruling one of the
strongest instincts of nature. These two kine, says Dr. Lightfoot, knew
their owner, their great owner ([Isa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#003).md), whom Hophni and Phinehas knew
not, to which I may add they brought home the ark to shame the stupidity
of Israel, that made no attempt to fetch it home. God's providence is
conversant about the motions even of brute-creatures, and serves its own
purposes by them. The lords of the Philistines, with a suitable retinue
no doubt, went after them, wondering at the power of the God of Israel;
and thus those who thought to triumph over the ark were made to go like
menial servants after it.

III\. How it was welcomed to the land of Israel: The men of Beth-shemesh
were reaping their wheat-harvest, [Sa1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#013.md). They were going on with their
worldly business, and were in no care about the ark, made no enquiries
what had become of it; if they had, it is likely they might have had
private intelligence beforehand of its coming, and might have gone to
meet it, and conduct it into their own border. But they were as careless
as the people that ceiled their own houses and let God's house lie
waste. Note, God will in his own time effect the deliverance of his
church, not only though it be fought against by its enemies, but though
it be neglected by its friends. Some observe that the returning ark
found the men of Beth-shemesh, not idling or sporting in the streets of
the city, but busy, reaping their corn in their fields, and well
employed. Thus the tidings of the birth of Christ were brought to the
shepherds when they were keeping their flock by night. The devil visits
idle men with his temptations. God visits industrious men with his
favours. The same invisible hand that directed the kine to the land of
Israel brought them into the field of Joshua, and in that field they
stood, some think for the owner's sake, on whom, being a very good man,
they suppose God designed to put this honour. I rather think it was for
the sake of the great stone in that field, which was convenient to put
the ark upon, and which is spoken of, v. 14, 15, 18. Now, 1. When the
reapers saw the ark, they rejoiced (v. 13); their joy for that was
greater than the joy of harvest, and therefore they left their work to
bid it welcome. When the Lord turned again the captivity of his ark they
were like men that dream; then was their mouth filled with laughter,
[Psa 126:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001.md), [Psa
126:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#002.md). Though they had not zeal and
courage enough to attempt the rescue or ransom of it, yet, when it did
come, they bade it heartily welcome. Note, The return of the ark, and
the revival of holy ordinances, after days of restraint and trouble,
cannot but be matter of great joy to every faithful Israelite. 3. They
offered up the kine for a burnt-offering, to the honour of God, and made
use of the wood of the cart for fuel, [Sa1
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#014.md). Probably the Philistines
intended these, when they sent them, to be a part of their
trespass-offering, to make atonement, [Sa1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#003.md), [Sa1
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#007.md). However, the men of Beth-shemesh
looked upon it as proper to make this use of them, because it was by no
means fit that ever they should be put to any other use; never shall
that cart carry any common thing that has once carried that sacred
symbol of the divine presence: and the kine had been under such an
immediate guidance of heaven that God had, as it were, already laid
claim to them; they were servants to him, and therefore must be
sacrifices to him, and no doubt were accepted, though females, whereas,
in strictness, every burnt-offering was to be a male. 3. They deposited
the ark, with a chest of jewels that the Philistines presented, upon the
great stone in the open field, a cold lodging for the ark of the Lord
and a very mean one; yet better so than in Dagon's temple, or in the
hands of the Philistines. It is desirable to see the ark in its
habitation in all the circumstances of solemnity and splendour; but
better have it upon a great stone, and in the fields of the wood, than
be without it. The intrinsic grandeur of instituted ordinances ought not
to be diminished in our eyes by the meanness and poverty of the place
where they are administered. As the burning of the cart and cows that
brought home the ark might be construed to signify their hopes that it
should never be carried away again out of the land of Israel, so the
setting of it upon a great stone might signify their hopes that it
should be established again upon a firm foundation. The church is built
upon a rock. 4. They offered the sacrifices of thanksgiving to God, some
think upon the great stone, more probably upon an altar of earth made
for the purpose, [Sa1 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#015.md). And, the
case being extraordinary, the law for offering at the altar in the court
of the tabernacle was dispensed with, and the more easily because Shiloh
was now dismantled; God himself had forsaken it, and the ark, which was
its chief glory, they had with them here. Beth-shemesh, though it lay
within the lot of the tribe of Dan, yet belonged to Judah, so that this
accidental bringing of the ark hither was an indication of its designed
settlement there, in process of time; for, when God refused the
tabernacle of Joseph, he chose the tribe of Judah, [Psa
78:67](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#067.md), [Psa
78:68](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#068.md). It was one of those cities
which were assigned out of the lot of Judah to the sons of Aaron, [Jos
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#016.md). Whither should the ark go but
to a priests' city? And it was well they had those of that sacred order
ready (for though they are here called Levites, [Sa1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#015.md), yet it should seem they were
priests) both to take down the ark and to offer the sacrifices. 5. The
lords of the Philistines returned to Ekron, much affected, we may
suppose, with what they had seen of the glory of God and the zeal of the
Israelites, and yet not reclaimed from the worship of Dagon; for how
seldom has a nation changed its gods, though they were no gods! [Jer
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#011.md). Though they cannot but think the
God of Israel glorious in holiness and fearful in praises, yet they are
resolved they will think Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, at least as good
as he, and to him they will cleave because he is theirs. 6. Notice is
taken of the continuance of the great stone in the same place; there it
is unto this day ([Sa1 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#018).md), because
it remained a lasting memorial of this great event, and served to
support the traditional history by which it was transmitted to
posterity. The fathers would say to the children, "This is the stone
upon which the ark of God was set when it came out of the Philistines'
hands, a thing never to be forgotten."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 6:19</span></span>

Here is, 1. The sin of the men of Beth-shemesh: They looked into the ark
of the Lord, [Sa1 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#019.md). Every
Israelite had heard great talk of the ark, and had been possessed with a
profound veneration for it; but they had been told that it was lodged
within a veil, and even the high priest himself might not look upon it
but once a year, and then through a cloud of incense. Perhaps this made
many say (as we are apt to covet that which is forbidden) what a great
deal they would give for a sight of it. Some of these Beth-shemites, we
may suppose, for that reason, rejoiced to see the ark ([Sa1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#013).md) more than for the sake of the
public. Yet this did not content them; they might see it, but they would
go further, they would take off the covering, which it is likely was
nailed or screwed on, and look into it, under pretence of seeing whether
the Philistines had not taken the two tables out of it or some way
damaged them, but really to gratify a sinful curiosity of their own,
which intruded into those things that God had thought fit to conceal
from them. Note, It is a great affront to God for vain men to pry into
and meddle with the secret things which belong not to them, [Deu
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#029.md); [Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018.md). We were all ruined by an
ambition of forbidden knowledge. That which made this looking into the
ark a great sin was that it proceeded from a very low and mean opinion
of the ark. The familiarity they had with it upon this occasion bred
contempt and irreverence. Perhaps they presumed upon their being
priests; but the dignity of the ministerial office will be so far from
excusing that it will aggravate a careless and irreverent treatment of
holy things. They should, by their example, have taught others to keep
their distance and look upon the ark with a holy awe. Perhaps they
presumed upon the kind entertainment they had given the ark, and the
sacrifices they had now offered to welcome it home with, for which they
thought the ark was indebted to them, and they might be allowed to repay
themselves with the satisfaction of looking into it. But let no man
think that his service done for God will justify him in any instance of
disrespect or irreverence towards the things of God. Or it may be they
presumed upon the present mean circumstances the ark was in, newly come
out of captivity, and unsettled; now that it stood upon a cold stone,
they thought they might make free with it; they should never have such
another opportunity of being familiar with it. It is an offence to God
if we think meanly of his ordinances because of the meanness of the
manner of their administration. Had they looked with an understanding
eye upon the ark, and not judged purely by outward appearance, they
would have thought that the ark never shone with greater majesty than it
did not. It had triumphed over the Philistines, and come out of its
house of bondage (like Christ out of the grave) by its own power; had
they considered this, they would not have looked into it thus, as a
common chest. 2. Their punishment for this sin: He smote the men of
Beth-shemesh, many of them, with a great slaughter. How jealous is God
for the honour of his ark! He will not suffer it to be profaned. Be not
deceived, God is not mocked. Those that will not fear his goodness, and
reverently use the tokens of his grace, shall be made to feel his
justice, and sink under the tokens of his displeasure. Those that pry
into what is forbidden, and come too near to holy fire, will find it is
at their peril. He smote 50,070 men. This account of the numbers smitten
is expressed in a very unusual manner in the original, which, besides
the improbability that there should be so many guilty and so many slain,
occasions many learned men to question whether we take the matter
aright. In the original it is, He smote in (or among) the people three
score and ten men, fifty thousand men. The Syriac and Arabic read it,
five thousand and seventy men. The Chaldee reads it, seventy men of the
elders, and fifty thousand of the common people. Seventy men as valuable
as 50,000, so some, because they were priests. Some think the seventy
men were the Beth-shemites that were slain for looking into the ark, and
the 50,000 were those that were slain by the ark, in the land of the
Philistines. He smote seventy men, that is, fifty out of a thousand,
which was one in twenty, a half decimation; so some understand it. The
Septuagint read it much as we do, he smote seventy men, and fifty
thousand men. Josephus says only seventy were smitten. 3. The terror
that was struck upon the men of Beth-shemesh by this severe stroke. They
said, as well they might, Who is able to stand before this holy Lord
God? [Sa1 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#020.md). Some think this
expresses their murmuring against God, as if he had dealt hardly and
unjustly with them. Instead of quarrelling with themselves and their own
sins, they quarrelled with God and his judgments; as David was
displeased, in a case not much dissimilar, [Sa2
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#008.md), [Sa2
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#009.md). I rather think it intimates their
awful and reverent adoration of God, as the Lord God, as a holy Lord
God, and as a God before whom none is able to stand. This they infer
from that tremendous judgment, "Who is able to stand before the God of
the ark?" To stand before God to worship him (blessed be his name) is
not impossible; we are through Christ invited, encouraged, and enabled
to do it, but to stand before God to contend with him we are not able.
Who is able to stand before the throne of his immediate glory, and look
full upon it? [Ti1 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016.md). Who is able
to stand before the tribunal of his enflexible justice, and make his
part good there? [Psa 130:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#003.md); [Psa
143:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#002.md). Who is able to stand before the
arm of his provoked power, and either resist or bear the strokes of it?
[Psa 76:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#007.md). 4. Their desire, hereupon,
to be rid of the ark. They asked, To whom shall he go up from us? [Sa1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#020.md). They should rather have asked,
"How may we make our peace with him, and recover his favour?" [Mic
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006.md), [Mic
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#007.md). But they begin to be as weary of
the ark as the Philistines had been, whereas, if they had treated it
with due reverence, who knows but it might have taken up its residence
among them, and they had all been blessed for the ark's sake? But thus,
when the word of God works with terror on sinners' consciences, they,
instead of taking the blame and shame to themselves, quarrel with the
word, and put it from them, [Jer 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#010.md).
They sent messengers to the elders of Kirjath-jearim, a strong city
further up in the country, and begged of them to come and fetch the ark
up thither, [Sa1 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#021.md). They durst not
touch it to bring it thither themselves, but stood aloof from it as a
dangerous thing. Thus do foolish men run from one extreme to the other,
from presumptuous boldness to slavish shyness. Kirjath-jearim, that is,
the city of woods, belonged to Judah, [Jos
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#009.md), [Jos
15:60](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#060.md). It lay in the way from
Beth-shemesh to Shiloh, so that when they sent to them to fetch it, we
may suppose, they intended that the elders of Shiloh should fetch it
thence, but God intended otherwise. Thus was it sent from town to town,
and no care taken of it by the public, a sign that there was no king in
Israel.
