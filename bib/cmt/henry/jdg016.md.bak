### [Judges Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#001.md)

[Judges](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jdg 16:0</span></span>

Samson's name (we have observed before) signifies a little sun
(solparvus); we have seen this sun rising very bright, and his morning
ray strong and clear; and, nothing appearing to the contrary, we take it
for granted that the middle of the day was proportionably illustrious,
while he judged Israel twenty years; but the melancholy story of this
chapter gives us such an account of his evening as did not commend his
day. This little sun set under a cloud, and yet, just in the setting,
darted forth one such strong and glorious beam as made him even then a
type of Christ, conquering by death. Here is, I. Samson greatly
endangered by his familiarity with one harlot, and hardly escaping ([Jdg
16:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#001).md). II. Samson quite ruined by
his familiarity with another harlot, Delilah. Observe, 1. How he was
betrayed to her by his own lusts ([Jdg
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#004).md). 2. How he was betrayed by her
to his sworn enemies, the Philistines, who, (1.) By her means got it out
of him at last where his great strength lay ([Jdg
16:5-17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#005)). (2..md) Then robbed him of his
strength, by taking from his head the crown of his separation ([Jdg
16:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#018)). (3..md) Then seized him,
blinded him, imprisoned him, abused him, and, at a solemn festival, made
a show of him ([Jdg 16:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#021).md). But,
lastly, he avenged himself of them by pulling down the theatre upon
their heads, and so dying with them ([Jdg
16:26-31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#026).md).

[Judges 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 16:1</span></span>

Here is, 1. Samson's sin, [Jdg 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#001.md).
His taking a Philistine to wife, in the beginning of his time, was in
some degree excusable, but to join himself to a harlot that he
accidentally saw among them was such a profanation of his honour as an
Israelite, as a Nazarite, that we cannot but blush to read it. Tell it
not in Gath. This vile impurity makes the graceful visage of this
Nazarite blacker than a coal, [Lam
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007.md), [Lam
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#008.md). We find not that Samson had any
business in Gaza; if he went thither in quest of a harlot it would make
one willing to hope that, as bad as things were otherwise, there were no
prostitutes among the daughters of Israel. Some think he went thither to
observe what posture the Philistines were in, that he might get some
advantages against them; if so, he forgot his business, neglected that,
and so fell into this snare. His sin began in his eye, with which he
should have made a covenant; he saw there one in the attire of a harlot,
and the lust which conceived brought forth sin: he went in unto her. 2.
Samson's danger. Notice was sent to the magistrates of Gaza, perhaps by
the treacherous harlot herself, that Samson was in the town, [Jdg
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#002.md). Probably he came in a disguise,
or in the dusk of the evening, and went into an inn or public-house,
which happened to be kept by this harlot. The gates of the city were
hereupon shut, guards set, all kept quiet, that Samson might suspect no
danger. Now they thought they had him in a prison, and doubted not but
to be the death of him the next morning. O that all those who indulge
their sensual appetites in drunkenness, uncleanness, or any fleshly
lusts, would see themselves thus surrounded, waylaid, and marked for
ruin, by their spiritual enemies! The faster they sleep, and the more
secure they are, the greater is their danger. 3. Samson's escape, [Jdg
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#003.md). He rose at midnight, perhaps
roused by a dream, in slumberings upon the bed ([Job
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#015).md), by his guardian angel, or
rather by the checks of his own conscience. He arose with a penitent
abhorrence (we hope) of the sin he was now committing, and of himself
because of it, and with a pious resolution not to return to it, - rose
under an apprehension of the danger he was in, that he was as one that
slept upon the top of a mast, - rose with such thoughts as these: "Is
this a bed fit for a Nazarite to sleep in? Shall a temple of the living
God be thus polluted? Can I be safe under this guilt?" It was bad that
he lay down without such checks; but it would have been worse if he had
lain still under them. He makes immediately towards the gate of the
city, probably finds the guards asleep, else he would have made them
sleep their last, stays not to break open the gates, but plucks up the
posts, takes them, gates and bar and all, all very large and strong and
a vast weight, yet he carries them on his back several miles, up to the
top of a hill, in disdain of their attempt to secure him with gates and
bars, designing thus to render himself more formidable to the
Philistines and more acceptable to his people, thus to give a proof of
the great strength God had given him and a type of Christ's victory over
death and the grave. He not only rolled away the stone from the door of
the sepulchre, and so came forth himself, but carried away the gates of
the grave, bar and all, and so left it, ever after, an open prison to
all that are his; it shall not, it cannot, always detain them. O death!
where is thy sting? Where are thy gates? Thanks be to him that not only
gained a victory for himself, but giveth us the victory!

[Judges 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 16:4</span></span>

The burnt child dreads the fire; yet Samson, that has more than the
strength of a man, in this comes short of the wisdom of a child; for,
though he had been more than once brought into the highest degree of
mischief and danger by the love of women and lusting after them, yet he
would not take warning, but is here again taken in the same snare, and
this third time pays for all. Solomon seems to refer especially to this
story of Samson when, in his caution against uncleanness, he gives this
account of a whorish woman ([Pro
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#026).md), that she hath cast down many
wounded, yea, many strong men have been slain by her; and ([Pro
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#026).md) that the adulteress will hunt
for the precious life. This bad woman, that brought Samson to ruin, is
here named Delilah, an infamous name, and fitly used to express the
person, or thing, that by flattery or falsehood brings mischief and
destruction on those to whom kindness is pretended. See here,

I. The affection Samson had for Delilah: he loved her, [Jdg
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#004.md). Some think she was his wife, but
then he would have had her home to his own house; others that he courted
her to make her his wife; but there is too much reason to suspect that
it was a sinful affection he had for her, and that he lived in
uncleanness with her. Whether she was an Israelite or a Philistine is
not certain. If an Israelite, which is scarcely probable, yet she had
the heart of a Philistine.

II\. The interest which the lords of the Philistines made with her to
betray Samson, [Jdg 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#005.md). 1. That
which they told her they designed was to humble him, or afflict him;
they would promise not to do him any hurt, only they would disable him
not to do them any. And so much conscience it should seem they made of
this promise that even then, when he lay ever so much at their mercy,
they would not kill him, no, not when the razor that cut his hair might
sooner and more easily have cut his throat. 2. That which they desired,
in order hereunto, was to know where his great strength lay, and by what
means he might be bound. Perhaps they imagined he had some spell or
charm which he carried about with him, by the force of which he did
these great things, and doubted not but that, if they could get this
from him, he would be manageable; and therefore, having had reason
enough formerly to know which was his blind side, hoped to find out his
riddle a second time by ploughing with his heifer. They engaged Delilah
to get it out of him, telling her what a kindness it would be to them,
and perhaps assuring her it should not be improved to any real mischief,
either to him or her. 3. For this they bid high, promised to give her
each of them 1100 pieces of silver, 5500 in all. So many shekels
amounted to above 1000l. sterling; with this she was hired to betray one
she pretended to love. See what horrid wickedness the love of money is
the root of. Our blessed Saviour was thus betrayed by one whom he called
friend, and with a kiss too, for filthy lucre. No marvel if those who
are unchaste, as Delilah, be unjust; such as lose their honesty in one
instance will in another.

III\. The arts by which he put her off from time to time, and kept his
own counsel a great while. She asked him where his great strength lay,
and whether it were possible for him to be bound and afflicted ([Jdg
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#006).md), pretending that she only
desired he would satisfy her curiosity in that one thing, and that she
thought it was impossible he should be bound otherwise than by her
charms.

1\. When she urged him very much, he told her, (1.) That he might be
bound with seven green withs, [Jdg
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#007.md). The experiment was tried ([Jdg
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#008).md), but it would not do: he broke
the withs as easily as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the
fire, [Jdg 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#009). (2..md) When she still
continued her importunity ([Jdg 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#010).md)
he told her that with two new ropes he might be so cramped and hampered
that he might be as easily dealt with as any other man, [Jdg
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#011.md). This experiment was tried too,
but it failed: the new ropes broke from off his arm like a thread, [Jdg
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#012). (3..md) When she still pressed him
to communicate the secret, and upbraided him with it as an unkindness
that he had bantered her so long, he then told her that the weaving of
the seven locks of his head would make a great alteration in him, [Jdg
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#013.md). This came nearer the matter
than any thing he had yet said, but it would not do: his strength
appeared to be very much in his hair, when, upon the trial of this,
purely by the strength of his hair, he carried away the pin of the beam
and the web.

2\. In the making of all these experiments, it is hard to say whether
there appears more of Samson's weakness or Delilah's wickedness. (1.)
Could any thing be more wicked than her restless and unreasonable
importunity with him to discover a secret which she knew would endanger
his life if ever it were lodged any where but in his own breast? What
could be more base and disingenuous, more false and treacherous, than to
lay his head in her lap, as one whom she loved, and at the same time to
design the betraying of him to those by whom he was mortally hated? (2.)
Could any thing be more weak than for him to continue a parley with one
who, he so plainly saw, was aiming to do him a mischief, - that he
should lend an ear so long to such an impudent request, that she might
know how to do him a mischief, - that when he perceived liers in wait
for him in the chamber, and that they were ready to apprehend him if
they had been able, he did not immediately quit the chamber, with a
resolution never to come into it any more, - nay, that he should again
lay his head in that lap out of which he had been so often roused with
that alarm, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson? One can hardly
imagine a man so perfectly besotted, and void of all consideration, as
Samson now was; but whoredom is one of those things that take away the
heart. It is hard to say what Samson meant in suffering her to try so
often whether she could weaken and afflict him; some think he did not
certainly know himself where his strength lay, but, it should seem, he
did know, for, when he told her that which would disable him indeed, it
is said, He told her all his heart. It seems, he designed to banter her,
and to try if he could turn it off with a jest, and to baffle the liers
in wait, and make fools of them; but it was very unwise in him that he
did not quit the field as soon as ever he perceived that he was not able
to keep the ground.

IV\. The disclosure he at last made of this great secret; and, if the
disclosure proved fatal to him, he must thank himself, who had not power
to keep his own counsel from one that manifestly sought his ruin. Surely
in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird, but in Samson's
sight is the net spread, and yet he is taken in it. If he had not been
blind before the Philistines put out his eyes, he might have seen
himself betrayed. Delilah signifies a consumer; she was so to him.
Observe, 1. How she teazed him, telling him she would not believe he
loved her, unless he would gratify her in this matter ([Jdg
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#015).md): How canst thou say, I love
thee, when they heart is not with me? That is, "when thou canst not
trust me with the counsels of they heart?" Passionate lovers cannot bear
to have their love called in question; they would do any thing rather
than their sincerity should be suspected. Here therefore Delilah had
this fond fool (excuse me that I call him so) at an advantage. This
expostulation is indeed grounded upon a great truth, that those only
have our love, not that have our good words or our good wishes, but that
have our hearts. That is love without dissimulation; but it is falsehood
and flattery in the highest degree to say we love those with whom our
hearts are not. How can we say we love either our brother, whom we have
seen, or God, whom we have not seen, if our hearts be not with him? She
continued many days vexatious to him with her importunity, so that he
had no pleasure of his life with her ([Jdg
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#016).md); why then did he not leave her?
It was because he was captivated to her by the power of love, falsely so
called, but truly lust. This bewitched and perfectly intoxicated him,
and by the force of it see, 2. How she conquered him ([Jdg
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#017).md): He told her all his heart. God
left him to himself to do this foolish thing, to punish him for
indulging himself in the lusts of uncleanness. The angel that foretold
his birth said nothing of his great strength, but only that he should be
a Nazarite, and particularly that no razor should come upon his head,
[Jdg 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#005.md). His consecration to God was
to be his strength, for he was to be strengthened according to the
glorious power of that Spirit which wrought in him mightily, that his
strength, by promise, not by nature, might be a type and figure of the
spiritual strength of believers, [Col
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#011.md), [Col
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#029.md). Therefore the badge of his
consecration was the pledge of his strength; if he lose the former, he
knows he forfeits the latter. "If I be shaven, I shall no longer be a
Nazarite, and then my strength will be lost." The making of his bodily
strength to depend so much on his hair, which could have no natural
influence upon it either one way or other, teaches us to magnify divine
institutions, and to expect God's grace, and the continuance of it, only
the use of those means of grace wherein he has appointed us to attend
upon him, the word, sacraments, and prayer. In these earthen vessels is
this treasure.

[Judges 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 16:18</span></span>

We have here the fatal consequences of Samson's folly in betraying his
own strength; he soon paid dearly for it. A whore is a deep ditch; he
that is abhorred of the Lord shall fall therein. In that pit Samson
sinks. Observe, 1. What care Delilah took to make sure of the money for
herself. She now perceived, by the manner of his speaking, that he had
told her all his heart, and the lords of the Philistines that hired her
to do this base thing are sent for; but they must be sure to bring the
money in their hands, [Jdg 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#018.md). The
wages of unrighteousness are accordingly produced, unknown to Samson. It
would have grieved one's heart to have seen one of the bravest men then
in the world sold and bought, as a sheep for the slaughter; how does
this instance sully all the glory of man, and forbid the strong man ever
to boast of his strength! 2. What course she took to deliver him up to
them according to the bargain. Many in the world would, for the
hundredth part of what was here given Delilah, sell those that they
pretend the greatest respect for. Trust not in a friend then, put no
confidence in a guide. See what a treacherous method she took ([Jdg
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#019).md): She made him sleep upon her
knees. Josephus says, She gave him some intoxicating liquor, which laid
him to sleep. What opiates she might steal into his cup we know not, but
we cannot suppose that he knowingly drank wine or strong drink, for that
would have been a forfeiture of his Nazariteship as much as the cutting
off of his hair. She pretended the greatest kindness even when she
designed the greatest mischief, which yet she could not have compassed
if she had not made him sleep. See the fatal consequences of security.
Satan ruins men by rocking them asleep, flattering them into a good
opinion of their own safety, and so bringing them to mind nothing and
fear nothing, and then he robs them of their strength and honour and
leads them captive at his will. When we sleep our spiritual enemies do
not. When he was asleep she had a person ready to cut off his hair,
which he did so silently and so quickly that it did not awake him, but
plainly afflicted him; even in his sleep, his spirit manifestly sunk
upon it. I think we may suppose that if this ill turn had been done to
him in his sleep by some spiteful body, without his being himself
accessory to it, as he was here, it would not have had this strange
effect upon him; but it was his own wickedness that corrected him. It
was his iniquity, else it would not have been so much his infelicity. 3.
What little concern he himself was in at it, [Jdg
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#020.md). He could not but miss his hair
as soon as he awoke, and yet said, "I will shake myself as at other
times after sleep," or, "as at other times when the Philistines were
upon me, to make my part good against them." Perhaps he thought to shake
himself the more easily, and that his head would feel the lighter, now
that his hair was cut, little thinking how much heavier the burden of
guilt was than that of hair. He soon found in himself some change, we
have reason to think so, and yet wist not that the Lord had departed
from him: he did not consider that this was the reason of the change.
Note, Many have lost the favourable presence of God and are not aware of
it; they have provoked God to withdraw from them, but are not sensible
of their loss, nor ever complain of it. Their souls languish and grow
weak, their gifts wither, every thing goes cross with them; and yet they
impute not this to the right cause: they are not aware that God has
departed from them, nor are they in any care to reconcile themselves to
him or to recover his favour. When God has departed we cannot do as at
other times. 4. What improvement the Philistines soon made of their
advantages against him, [Jdg 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#021.md).
The Philistines took him when God had departed from him. Those that have
thrown themselves out of God's protection become an easy prey to their
enemies. If we sleep in the lap of our lusts, we shall certainly wake in
the hands of the Philistines. It is probable they had promised Delilah
not to kill him, but they took an effectual course to disable him. The
first thing they did, when they had him in their hands and found they
could manage him, was to put out his eyes, by applying fire to them,
says the Arabic version. They considered that his eyes would never come
again, as perhaps his hair might, and that the strongest arms could do
little without eyes to guide the, and therefore, if now they blind him,
they for ever blind him. His eyes were the inlets of his sin: he saw the
harlot at Gaza, and went in unto her ([Jdg
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#001).md), and now his punishment began
there. Now that the Philistines had blinded him he had time to remember
how his own lust had blinded him. The best preservative of the eyes is
to turn them away from beholding vanity. They brought him down to Gaza,
that there he might appear in weakness where he had lately given such
proofs of his strength ([Jdg 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#003).md),
and be a jest to those to whom he had been a terror. They bound him with
fetters of brass who had before been held in the cords of his own
iniquity, and he did grind in the prison, work in their bridewell,
either for their profit or his punishment, or for both. The devil does
thus by sinners, blinds the minds of those who believe not, and so
enslaves them, and secures them in his interests. Poor Samson, how hast
thou fallen! How is thy honour laid in the dust! How has the glory and
defence of Israel become the drudge and triumph of the Philistines! The
crown has fallen from his head; woe unto him, for he hath sinned. Let
all take warning by his fall carefully to preserve their purity, and to
watch against all fleshly lusts; for all our glory has gone, and our
defence departed form us, when the covenant of our separation to God, as
spiritual Nazarites, is profaned.

[Judges 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 16:22</span></span>

Though the last stage of Samson's life was inglorious, and one could
wish there were a veil drawn over it, yet this account here given of his
death may be allowed to lessen, though it does not quite roll away, the
reproach of it; for there was honour in his death. No doubt he greatly
repented of his sin, the dishonour he had by it done to God and his
forfeiture of the honour God had put upon him; for that God was
reconciled to him appears, 1. By the return of the sign of his
Nazariteship ([Jdg 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#022).md): His hair
began to grow again, as when he was shaven, that is, to be as thick and
as long as when it was cut off. It is probable that their general
thanksgiving to Dagon was not long deferred, before which Samson's hair
had thus grown, by which, and the particular notice taken of it, it
seems to have been extraordinary, and designed for a special indication
of the return of God's favour to him upon his repentance. For the growth
of his hair was neither the cause nor the sign of the return of his
strength further than as it was the badge of his consecration, and a
token that God accepted him as a Nazarite again, after the interruption,
without those ceremonies which were appointed for the restoration of a
lapsed Nazarite, which he had not now the opportunity of performing,
[Num 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#009.md). It is strange that the
Philistines in whose hands he was were not jealous of the growth of his
hair again, and did not cut it; but perhaps they were willing his great
strength should return to him, that they might have so much the more
work out of him, and now that he was blind they were in no fear of any
hurt from him. 2. By the use God made of him for the destruction of the
enemies of his people, and that at a time when it would be most for the
vindication of the honour of God, and not immediately for the defence
and deliverance of Israel. Observe,

I. How insolently the Philistines affronted the God of Israel, 1. By the
sacrifices they offered to Dagon, his rival. This Dagon they call their
god, a god of their own making, represented by an image, the upper part
of which was in the shape of a man, the lower part of a fish, purely the
creature of fancy; yet it served them to set up in opposition to the
true and living God. To this pretended deity they ascribe their success
([Jdg 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#023.md), [Jdg
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#024).md): Our god has delivered Samson
our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, into our hands. So they
dreamed, though he could do neither good nor evil. They knew Delilah had
betrayed him, and they had paid her for doing it, yet they attribute it
to their god, and are confirmed by it in their belief of his power to
protect them. All people will thus walk in the name of their gods: they
will give them the praise of their achievements; and shall not we pay
this tribute to our God whose kingdom ruleth over all? Yet, considering
what wicked arts they used to get Samson into their hands, it must be
confessed it was only such a dunghill-deity as Dagon that was fit to be
made a patron of the villany. Sacrifices were offered, and songs of
praise sung, on the general thanksgiving day, for this victory obtained
over one man; there were great expressions of joy, and all to the honour
of Dagon. Much more reason have we to give the praise of all our
successes to our God. Thanks be to him who causeth us to triumph in
Christ Jesus! 2. By the sport they made with Samson, God's champion,
they reflected on God himself. When they were merry with wine, to make
them more merry Samson must be fetched to make sport for them ([Jdg
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#025.md), [Jdg
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#027).md), that is, for them to make
sport with. Having sacrificed to their god, and eaten and drunk upon the
sacrifice, they rose up to play, according to the usage of idolaters
([Co1 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#007).md), and Samson must be the
fool in the play. They made themselves and one another laugh to see how,
being blind, he stumbled and blundered. It is likely they smote this
judge of Israel upon the cheek ([Mic
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001).md), and said, Prophesy who smote
thee. It was an instance of their barbarity to trample thus upon a man
in misery, at the sight of whom awhile ago they would have trembled. It
put Samson into the depth of misery, and as a sword in his bones were
their reproaches, when they said, Where is now they God? Nothing could
be more grievous to so great a spirit; yet, being a penitent, his godly
sorrow makes him patient, and he accepts the indignity as the punishment
of his iniquity. How unrighteous soever the Philistines were, he could
not but own that God was righteous. He had sported himself in his own
deceivings and with his own deceivers, and justly are the Philistines
let loose upon him to make sport with him. Uncleanness is a sin that
makes men vile, and exposes them to contempt. A wound and dishonour
shall he get whose heart is deceived by a woman, and his reproach shall
not be wiped away. Everlasting shame and contempt will be the portion of
those that are blinded and bound by their own lusts. The devil that
deceived them will insult over them.

II\. How justly the God of Israel brought sudden destruction upon them
by the hands of Samson. Thousands of the Philistines had got together,
to attend their lords in the sacrifices and joys of this day, and to be
the spectators of this comedy; but it proved to them a fatal tragedy,
for they were all slain, and buried in the ruins of the house: whether
it was a temple or a theatre, or whether it was some slight building run
up for the purpose, is uncertain. Observe,

1\. Who were destroyed: All the lords of the Philistines ([Jdg
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#027).md), who had by bribes corrupted
Delilah to betray Samson to them. Evil pursued those sinners. Many of
the people likewise, to the number of 3000, and among them a great many
women, one of whom, it is likely, was that harlot of Gaza mentioned,
[Jdg 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#001.md). Samson had been drawn into
sin by the Philistine women, and now a great slaughter is made among
them, as was by Moses's order among the women of Midian, because it was
they that caused the children of Israel to trespass against the Lord in
the matter of Peor, [Num 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#016.md).

2\. When they were destroyed. (1.) When they were merry, secure, and
jovial, and far from apprehending themselves in any danger. When they
saw Samson lay hold of the pillars, we may suppose, his doing so served
them for a jest, and they made sport with that too: What will this
feeble Jew do? How are sinners brought to desolation in a moment! They
are lifted up in pride and mirth, that their fall may be the more
dreadful. Let us never envy the mirth of wicked people, but infer from
this instance that their triumphing is short and their joy but for a
moment. (2.) It was when they were praising Dagon their god, and giving
that honour to him which is due to God only, which is no less than
treason against the King of kings, his crown and dignity. Justly
therefore is the blood of these traitors mingled with their sacrifices.
Belshazzar was cut off when he was praising his man-made gods, [Dan
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#004). (3..md) It was when they were making
sport with an Israelite, a Nazarite, and insulting over him, persecuting
him whom God had smitten. Nothing fills the measure of the iniquity of
any person or people faster than mocking and misusing the servants of
God, yea, though it is by their own folly that they are brought low.
Those know not what they do, nor whom they affront, that make sport with
a good man.

3\. How they were destroyed. Samson pulled the house down upon them, God
no doubt putting it into his heart, as a public person, thus to avenge
God's quarrel with them, Israel's, and his own. (1.) He gained strength
to do it by prayer, [Jdg 16:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#028.md). That
strength which he had lost by sin he, like a true penitent, recovers by
prayer; as David, who, when he had provoked the Spirit of grace to
withdraw, prayed ([Psa 51:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#012).md), Restore
unto me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with thy free Spirit. We
may suppose that this was only a mental prayer, and that his voice was
not heard (for it was made in a noisy clamorous crowd of Philistines);
but, though his voice was not heard of men, yet his prayer was heard of
God and graciously answered, and though he lived not to give an account
himself of this his prayer, as Nehemiah did of his, yet God not only
accepted it in heaven, but, by revealing it to the inspired penmen,
provided for the registering of it in his church. He prayed to God to
remember him and strengthen him this once, thereby owning that his
strength for what he had already done he had from God, and begged it
might be afforded to him once more, to give them a parting blow. That it
was not from a principle of passion or personal revenge, but from a holy
zeal for the glory of God and Israel, that he desired to do this,
appears from God's accepting and answering the prayer. Samson died
praying, so did our blessed Saviour; but Samson prayed for vengeance,
Christ for forgiveness. (2.) He gained opportunity to do it by leaning
on the two pillars which were the chief supports of the building, and
were, it seems, so near together that he could take hold of them both at
one time, v. 26, 29. Having hold of them, he bore them down with all his
might, crying aloud, Let me die with the Philistines, v. 30. Animamque
in vulnere ponit - While inflicting the wound he dies. The vast
concourse of people that were upon the roof looking down through it to
see the sport, we may suppose, contributed to the fall of it. A weight
so much greater than ever it was designed to carry might perhaps have
sunk of itself, at least it made the fall more fatal to those within:
and indeed few of either could escape being either stifled or crushed to
death. This was done, not by any natural strength of Samson, but by the
almighty power of God, and is not only marvellous, but miraculous, in
our eyes. Now in this, \[1.\] The Philistines were greatly mortified.
All their lords and great men were killed, and abundance of their
people, and this in the midst of their triumph; the temple of Dagon (as
many think the house was) was pulled down, and Dagon buried in it. This
would give a great check to the insolence of the survivors, and, if
Israel had but had so much sense and spirit left them as to improve the
advantages of this juncture, they might now have thrown off the
Philistines' yoke. \[2.\] Samson may very well be justified, and brought
in not guilty of any sinful murder either of himself or the Philistines.
He was a public person, a declared enemy to the Philistines, against
whom he might therefore take all advantages. They were now in the most
barbarous manner making war upon him; all present were aiding and
abetting, and justly die with him. Nor was he felo de se, or a
self-murderer, in it; for it was not his own life that he aimed at,
though he had too much reason to be weary of it, but the lives of
Israel's enemies, for the reaching of which he bravely resigned his own,
not counting it dear to him, so that he might finish his course with
honour. \[3.\] God was very much glorified in pardoning Samson's great
transgressions, of which this was an evidence. It has been said that the
prince's giving a commission to one convicted amounts to a pardon. Yet,
though he was a God that forgave him, he took vengeance of his
inventions ([Psa 99:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#008).md), and, by
suffering his champion to die in fetters, warned all to take heed of
those lusts which war against the soul. However, we have good reason to
hope that though Samson died with the Philistines he had not his
everlasting portion with them. The Lord knows those that are his. \[4.\]
Christ was plainly typified. He pulled down the devil's kingdom, as
Samson did Dagon's temple; and, when he died, he obtained the most
glorious victory over the powers of darkness. Then when his arms were
stretched out upon the cross, as Samson's to the two pillars, he gave a
fatal shake to the gates of hell, and, through death, destroyed him that
had the power of death, that is, the devil ([Heb
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014.md), [Heb
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#015).md), and herein exceeded Samson,
that he not only died with the Philistines, but rose again to triumph
over them.

Lastly, The story of Samson concludes, 1. With an account of his burial.
His own relations, animated by the glories that attended his death, came
and found out his body among the slain, brought it honourably to his own
country, and buried it in the place of his fathers' sepulchres, the
Philistines being in such a consternation that they durst not oppose it.
2. With the repetition of the account we had before of the continuance
of his government: He judged Israel twenty years; and, if they had not
been as mean and sneaking as he was brave and daring, he would have left
them clear of the Philistines' yoke. They might have been easy, safe,
and happy, if they would but have given God and their judges leave to
make them so.
