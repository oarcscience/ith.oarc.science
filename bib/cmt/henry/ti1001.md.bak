### [1 Timothy Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md)

After the inscription ([Ti1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md), [Ti1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#002).md) we have, I. The charge given to
Timothy ([Ti1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003.md), [Ti1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004).md). II. The true end of the law
([Ti1 1:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005).md), where he shows that it
is entirely agreeable to the gospel. III. He mentions his own call to be
an apostle, for which he expresses his thankfulness ([Ti1
1:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#012).md) IV. His doxology ([Ti1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#017).md). V. A renewal of the charge to
Timothy ([Ti1 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018).md). And of Hymenaeus
and Alexander ([Ti1 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019.md), [Ti1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020).md).

[1 Timothy 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 1:1</span></span>

Here is, I. The inscription of the epistle, from whom it is sent: Paul
an apostle of Jesus Christ, constituted an apostle by the commandment of
God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ. His credentials were
unquestionable. He had not only a commission, but a commandment, not
only from God our Saviour, but from Jesus Christ: he was a preacher of
the gospel of Christ, and a minister of the kingdom of Christ. Observe,
God is our Saviour. - Jesus Christ, who is our hope. Observe, Jesus
Christ is a Christian's hope; our hope is in him, all our hope of
eternal life is built upon him; Christ is in us the hope of glory, [Col
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027.md). He calls Timothy his own son,
because he had been an instrument of his conversion, and because he had
been a son that served him, served with him in the gospel, [Phi
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#022.md). Timothy had not been wanting in
the duty of a son to Paul, and Paul was not wanting in the care and
tenderness of a father to him.

II\. The benediction is, grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father.
Some have observed that whereas in all the epistles to the churches the
apostolical benediction is grace and peace, in these two epistles to
Timothy and that to Titus it is grace, mercy, and peace: as if ministers
had more need of God's mercy than other men. Ministers need more grace
than others, to discharge their duty faithfully; and they need more
mercy than others, to pardon what is amiss in them: and if Timothy, so
eminent a minister, must be indebted to the mercy of God, and needed the
increase and continuance of it, how much more do we ministers, in these
times, who have so little of his excellent spirit!

III\. Paul tells Timothy what was the end of his appointing him to this
office: I besought thee to abide at Ephesus. Timothy had a mind to go
with Paul, was loth to go from under his wing, but Paul would have it
so; it was necessary for the public service: I besought thee, says he.
Though he might assume an authority to command him, yet for love's sake
he chose rather to beseech him. Now his business was to take care to fix
both the ministers and the people of that church: Charge them that they
teach no other doctrine than what they have received, that they do not
add to the Christian doctrine, under pretence of improving it or making
up the defects of it, that they do no alter it, but cleave to it as it
was delivered to them. Observe, 1. Ministers must not only be charged to
preach the true doctrine of the gospel, but charged to preach no other
doctrine. If an angel from heaven preach any other doctrine, let him be
anathema, [Gal 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#008.md). 2. In the times of
the apostles there were attempts made to corrupt Christianity (we are
not as many, who corrupt the word, [Co2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017).md), otherwise this charge to
Timothy might have been spared. 3. He must not only see to it that he
did not preach any other doctrine, but he must charge others that they
might not add any thing of their own to the gospel, or take any thing
from it, but that they preach it pure and uncorrupt. He must also take
care to prevent their regarding fables, and endless genealogies, and
strifes of words. This is often repeated in these two epistles (as [Ti1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007.md); [Ti1
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#004.md); [Ti2
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#023).md), as well as in the epistle to
Titus. As among the Jews there were some who brought Judaism into
Christianity; so among the Gentiles there were some who brought paganism
into Christianity. "Take heed of these," says he, "watch against them,
or they will be the corrupting and ruining of religion among you, for
they minister questions rather than edifying." That which ministers
questions is not for edifying; that which gives occasion for doubtful
disputes pulls down the church rather than builds it up. And I think, by
a parity of reason, every thing else that ministers questions rather
than godly edifying should be disclaimed and disregarded by us, such as
an uninterrupted succession in the ministry from the apostles down to
these times, the absolute necessity of episcopal ordination, and of the
intention of the minister to the efficacy and validity of the sacraments
he ministers. These are as bad as Jewish fables and endless genealogies,
for they involve us in inextricable difficulties, and tend only to shake
the foundations of a Christian's hope and to fill his mind with
perplexing doubts and fears. Godly edifying is the end ministers should
aim at in all their discourses, that Christians may be improving in
godliness and growing up to a greater likeness to the blessed God.
Observe, further, Godly edifying must be in faith: the gospel is the
foundation on which we build; it is by faith that we come to God at
first ([Heb 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006).md), and it must be in
the same way, and by the same principle of faith, that we must be
edified. Again, Ministers should avoid, as much as may be, what will
occasion disputes; and would do well to insist on the great and
practical points of religion, about which there can be no disputes; for
even disputes about great and necessary truths draw off the mind from
the main design of Christianity, and eat out the vitals of religion,
which consist in practice and obedience as well as in faith, that we may
not hold the truth in unrighteousness, but may keep the mystery of the
faith in a pure conscience.

[1 Timothy 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti1 1:5</span></span>

Here the apostle instructs Timothy how to guard against the judaizing
teachers, or others who mingled fables and endless genealogies with the
gospel. He shows the use of the law, and the glory of the gospel.

I. He shows the end and uses of the law: it is intended to promote love,
for love is the fulfilling of the law, [Rom
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#010.md).

1\. The end of the commandment is charity, or love, [Rom
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#008.md). The main scope and drift of the
divine law are to engage us to the love of God and one another; and
whatever tends to weaken either our love to God or love to the brethren
tends to defeat the end of the commandment: and surely the gospel, which
obliges us to love our enemies, to do good to those who hate us ([Mat
5:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044).md) does not design to lay aside or
supersede a commandment the end whereof is love; so far from it that, on
the other hand, we are told that though we had all advantages and wanted
charity, we are but as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal, [Co1
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001.md). By this shall all men know that
you are my disciples, if you love one another, [Joh
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#035.md). Those therefore who boasted of
their knowledge of the law, but used it only as a colour for the
disturbance that they gave to the preaching of the gospel (under
pretence of zeal for the law, dividing the church and distracting it),
defeated that which was the very end of the commandment, and that is
love, love out of a pure heart, a heart purified by faith, purified from
corrupt affections. In order to the keeping up of holy love our hearts
must be cleansed from all sinful love; our love must arise out of a good
conscience, kept without offence. Those answer the end of the
commandment who are careful to keep a good conscience, from a real
belief of the truth of the word of God which enjoins it, here called a
faith unfeigned. Here we have the concomitants of that excellency grace
charity; they are three: - (1.) A pure heart; there it must be seated,
and thence it must take its rise. (2.) A good conscience, in which we
must exercise ourselves daily, that we may not only get it, but that we
may keep it, [Act 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#016). (3..md) Faith
unfeigned must also accompany it, for it is love without dissimulation:
the faith that works by it must be of the like nature, genuine and
sincere. Now some who set up for teachers of the law swerved from the
very end of the commandment: they set up for disputers, but their
disputes proved vain jangling; they set up for teachers, but they
pretended to teach others what they themselves did not understand. If
the church be corrupted by such teachers, we must not think it strange,
for we see from the beginning it was so. Observe, \[1.\] When persons,
especially ministers, swerve from the great law of charity - the end of
the commandment, they will turn aside to vain jangling; when a man
misses his end and scope, it is no wonder that every step he takes is
out of the way. \[2.\] Jangling, especially in religion, is vain; it is
unprofitable and useless as to all that is good, and it is very
pernicious and hurtful: and yet many people's religion consists of
little else but vain jangling. \[3.\] Those who deal much in vain
jangling are fond and ambitious to be teachers of others; they desire
(that is, they affect) the office of teaching. \[4.\] It is too common
for men to intrude into the office of the ministry when they are very
ignorant of those things about which they are ton speak: they understand
neither what they say nor whereof they affirm; and by such learned
ignorance, no doubt, they edify their hearers very much!

2\. The use of the law ([Ti1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#008).md): The
law is good, if a man use it lawfully. The Jews used it unlawfully, as
an engine to divide the church, a cover to the malicious opposition they
made to the gospel of Christ; they set it up for justification, and so
used it unlawfully. We must not therefore think to set it aside, but use
it lawfully, for the restraint of sin. The abuse which some have made of
the law does not take away the use of it; but, when a divine appointment
has been abused, call it back to its right use and take away the abuses,
for the law is still very useful as a rule of life; though we are not
under it as under a covenant of works, yet it is good to teach us what
is sin and what is duty. It is not made for a righteous man, that is, it
is not made for those who observe it; for, if we could keep the law,
righteousness would be by the law ([Gal
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#021).md): but it is made for wicked
persons, to restrain them, to check them, and to put a stop to vice and
profaneness. It is the grace of God that changes men's hearts; but the
terrors of the law may be of use to tie their hands and restrain their
tongues. A righteous man does not want those restraints which are
necessary for the wicked; or at least the law is not made primarily and
principally for the righteous, but for sinners of all sorts, whether in
a greater or less measure, [Ti1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009.md),
[Ti1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010.md). In this black roll of
sinners, he particularly mentions breaches of the second table, duties
which we owe to our neighbour; against the fifth and sixth commandments,
murderers of fathers and mothers, and manslayers; against the seventh,
whoremongers, and those that defile themselves with mankind; against the
eighth, men-stealers; against the ninth, liars and perjured persons; and
then he closes his account with this, and if there be any other thing
that is contrary to sound doctrine. Some understand this as an
institution of a power in the civil magistrate to make laws against such
notorious sinners as are specified, and to see those laws put in
execution.

II\. He shows the glory and grace of the gospel. Paul's epithets are
expressive and significant; and frequently every one is a sentence: as
here ([Ti1 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#011).md), According to the
glorious gospel of the blessed God. Let us learn hence, 1. To call God
blessed God, infinitely happy in the enjoyment of himself and his own
perfections. 2. To call the gospel the glorious gospel, for so it is:
much of the glory of God appears in the works of creation and
providence, but much more in the gospel, where it shines in the face of
Jesus Christ. Paul reckoned it a great honour put upon him, and a great
favour done him, that this glorious gospel was committed to his trust;
that is, the preaching of it, for the framing of it is not committed to
any man or company of men in the world. The settling of the terms of
salvation in the gospel of Christ is God's own work; but the publishing
of it to the world is committed to the apostles and ministers. Note
here, (1.) The ministry is a trust, for the gospel was committed unto
this apostle; it is an office of trust as well as of power, and the
former more than the latter; for this reason ministers are called
stewards, [Co1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#001). (2..md) It is a
glorious trust, because the gospel committed to them is a glorious
gospel; it is a trust of very great importance. God's glory is very much
concerned in it. Lord, what a trust is committed to us! How much grace
do we want, to be found faithful in this great trust!

[1 Timothy 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti1 1:12</span></span>

Here the apostle, I. Returns thanks to Jesus Christ for putting him into
the ministry. Observe, 1. It is Christ's work to put men into the
ministry, [Act 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#016.md), [Act
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#017.md). God condemned the false
prophets among the Jews in these words, I have not sent these prophets,
yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied, [Jer
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#021.md). Ministers, properly speaking,
cannot make themselves ministers; for it is Christ's work, as king and
head, prophet and teacher, of his church. 2. Those whom he puts into the
ministry he fits for it; whom he calls he qualifies. Those ministers who
are no way fit for their work, nor have ability for it, are not of
Christ's putting into the ministry, though there are different
qualifications as to gifts and graces. 3. Christ gives not only ability,
but fidelity, to those whom he puts into the ministry: He counted me
faithful; and none are counted faithful but those whom he makes so.
Christ's ministers are trusty servants, and they ought to be so, having
so great a trust committed to them. 4. A call to the ministry is a great
favour, for which those who are so called ought to give thanks to Jesus
Christ: I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath put me into the
ministry.

II\. The more to magnify the grace of Christ in putting him into the
ministry, he gives an account of his conversion.

1\. What he was before his conversion: A blasphemer, a persecutor, and
injurious. Saul breathed out threatenings and slaughter against the
disciples of the Lord, [Act 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001.md). He
made havoc of the church, [Act 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#003.md). He
was a blasphemer of God, a persecutor of the saints, and injurious to
both. Frequently those who are designed for great and eminent services
are left to themselves before their conversion, to fall into great
wickedness, that the mercy of God may be the more glorified in their
remission, and the grace of God in their regeneration. The greatness of
sin is no bar to our acceptance with God, no, nor to our being employed
for him, if it be truly repented of. Observe here, (1.) Blasphemy,
persecution, and injuriousness, are very great and heinous sins, and
those who are guilty of them are sinners before God exceedingly. To
blaspheme God is immediately and directly to strike at God; to persecute
his people is to endeavour to wound him through their sides; and to be
injurious is to be like Ishmael, whose hand was against every one, and
every one was against him; for such invade God's prerogative, and
encroach upon the liberties of their fellow-creatures. (2.) True
penitents, to serve a good purpose, will not be backward to own their
former condition before they were brought home to God: this good apostle
often confessed what his former life had been, as [Act
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#004.md); [Act
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010.md), [Act
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#011.md).

2\. The great favour of God to him: But I obtained mercy. This was a
blessed but indeed, a great favour, that so notorious a rebel should
find mercy with his prince.

(1.) If Paul had persecuted the Christians wilfully, knowing them to be
the people of God, for aught I know he had been guilty of the
unpardonable sin; but, because he did it ignorantly and in unbelief, he
obtained mercy. Note, \[1.\] What we do ignorantly is a less crime than
what we do knowingly; yet a sin of ignorance is a sin, for he that knew
not his Master's will, but did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be
beaten with few stripes, [Luk 12:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#048.md).
Ignorance in some cases will extenuate a crime, though it do not take it
away. \[2.\] Unbelief is at the bottom of what sinners do ignorantly;
they do not believe God's threatenings, otherwise they could not do as
they do. \[3.\] For these reasons Paul obtained mercy: But I obtained
mercy, because I did it ignorantly, in unbelief. \[4.\] Here was mercy
for a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an injurious person: "But I obtained
mercy, I a blasphemer," etc.

(2.) Here he takes notice of the abundant grace of Jesus Christ, [Ti1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#014.md). The conversion and salvation of
great sinners are owing to the grace of Christ, his exceedingly abundant
grace, even that grace of Christ which appears in his glorious gospel
([Ti1 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015).md): This is a faithful
saying, etc. Here we have the sum of the whole gospel, that Jesus Christ
came into the world. The Son of God took upon him our nature, was made
flesh, and dwelt among us, [Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md).
He came into the world, not to call the righteous but sinners to
repentance, [Mat 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#013.md). His errand into
the world was to seek and find, and so save, those that were lost, [Luk
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#010.md). The ratification of this is
that it is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation. It is good
news, worthy of all acceptation; and yet not too good to be true, for it
is a faithful saying. It is a faithful saying, and therefore worthy to
be embraced in the arms of faith: it is worthy of all acceptation, and
therefore to be received with holy love, which refers to the foregoing
verse, where the grace of Christ is said to abound in faith and love. In
the close of the verse Paul applies it to himself: Of whom I am chief.
Paul was a sinner of the first rank; so he acknowledges himself to have
been, for he breathed out threatenings and slaughter against the
disciples of the Lord, etc., [Act 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001.md),
[Act 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002.md). Persecutors are some of the
worst of sinners: such a one Paul had been. Or, of whom I am chief, that
is, of pardoned sinners I am chief. It is an expression of his great
humility; he that elsewhere calls himself the least of all saints ([Eph
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#008).md) here calls himself the chief of
sinners. Observe, \[1.\] Christ Jesus has come into the world; the
prophecies concerning his coming are now fulfilled. \[2.\] He came to
save sinners; he came to save those who could not save and help
themselves. \[3.\] Blasphemers and persecutors are the chief of sinners,
so Paul reckoned them. \[4.\] The chief of sinners may become the chief
of saints; so this apostle was, for he was not a whit behind the very
chief apostles ([Co2 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#005).md), for Christ
came to save the chief of sinners. \[5.\] This is a very great truth, it
is a faithful saying; these are true and faithful words, which may be
depended on. \[6.\] It deserves to be received, to be believed by us
all, for our comfort and encouragement.

(3.) The mercy which Paul found with God, notwithstanding his great
wickedness before his conversion, he speaks of,

\[1.\] For the encouragement of others to repent and believe ([Ti1
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#016).md): For this cause I obtained
mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all
long-suffering, for a pattern to those who should hereafter believe. It
was an instance of the long-suffering of Christ that he would bear so
much with one who had been so very provoking; and it was designed for a
pattern to all others, that the greatest sinners might not despair of
mercy with God. Note here, First, Our apostle was one of the first great
sinners converted to Christianity. Secondly, He was converted, and
obtained mercy, for the sake of others as well as of himself; he was a
pattern to others. Thirdly, The Lord Jesus Christ shows great
long-suffering in the conversion of great sinners. Fourthly, Those who
obtain mercy believe on the Lord Jesus Christ; for without faith it is
impossible to please God, [Heb 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006.md).
Fifthly, Those who believe on Christ believe on him to life everlasting;
they believe to the saving of the soul, [Heb
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#039.md).

\[2.\] He mentions it to the glory of God having spoken of the mercy he
had found with God, he could not go on with his letter without inserting
a thankful acknowledgment of God's goodness to him: Now unto the King
eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for
ever and ever. Amen. Observe, First, That grace which we have the
comfort of God must have the glory of. Those who are sensible of their
obligations to the mercy and grace of God will have their hearts
enlarged in his praise. Here is praise ascribed to him, as the King
eternal, immortal, invisible. Secondly, When we have found God good we
must not forget to pronounce him great; and his kind thoughts of us must
not at all abate our high thoughts of him, but rather increase them. God
had taken particular cognizance of Paul, and shown him mercy, and taken
him into communion with himself, and yet he calls him the King eternal,
etc. God's gracious dealings with us should fill us with admiration of
his glorious attributes. He is eternal, without beginning of days, or
end of life, or change of time. He is the Ancient of days, [Dan
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md). He is immortal, and the original
of immortality; he only has immortality ([Ti1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016).md), for he cannot die. He is
invisible, for he cannot be seen with mortal eyes, dwelling in the light
to which no man can approach, whom no man hath seen nor can see, [Ti1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016.md). He is the only wise God ([Jde
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#025).md); he only is infinitely wise, and
the fountain of all wisdom. "To him be glory for ever and ever," or,
"Let me be for ever employed in giving honour and glory to him, as the
thousands of thousands do," [Rev 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#012.md),
[Rev 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#013.md).

[1 Timothy 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ti1 1:18</span></span>

Here is the charge he gives to Timothy to proceed in his work with
resolution, [Ti1 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018.md). Observe here,
The gospel is a charge committed to the ministers of it; it is committed
to their trust, to see that it be duly applied according to the intent
and meaning of it, and the design of its great Author. It seems, there
had been prophecies before concerning Timothy, that he should be taken
into the ministry, and should prove eminent in the work of the ministry;
this encouraged Paul to commit this charge to him. Observe, 1. The
ministry is a warfare, it is a good warfare against sin and Satan: and
under the banner of the Lord Jesus, who is the Captain of our salvation
([Heb 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010).md), and in his cause, and
against his enemies, ministers are in a particular manner engaged. 2.
Ministers must war this good warfare, must execute their office
diligently and courageously, notwithstanding oppositions and
discouragements. 3. The prophecies which went before concerning Timothy
are here mentioned as a motive to stir him up to a vigorous and
conscientious discharge of his duty; so the good hopes that others have
entertained concerning us should excite us to our duty: That thou by
them mightest war a good warfare. 4. We must hold both faith and a good
conscience: Holding faith and a good conscience, [Ti1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019.md). Those that put away a good
conscience will soon make shipwreck of faith. Let us live up to the
directions of a renewed enlightened conscience, and keep conscience void
of offence ([Act 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#016).md), a conscience
not debauched by any vice or sin, and this will be a means of preserving
us sound in the faith; we must look to the one as well a the other, for
the mystery of the faith must be held in a pure conscience, [Ti1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#009.md). As for those who had made
shipwreck of the faith, he specifies two, Hymeneus and Alexander, who
had made a profession of the Christian religion, but had quitted that
profession; and Paul had delivered them to Satan, had declared them to
belong to the kingdom of Satan, and, as some think, had, by an
extraordinary power, delivered them to be terrified or tormented by
Satan, that they might learn not to blaspheme not to contradict or
revile the doctrine of Christ and the good ways of the Lord. Observe,
The primary design of the highest censure in the primitive church was to
prevent further sin and to reclaim the sinner. In this case it was for
the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit might be saved in the day
of the Lord Jesus, [Co1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005.md). Observe,
(1.) Those who love the service and work of Satan are justly delivered
over to the power of Satan: Whom I have delivered over to Satan. (2.)
God can, if he please, work by contraries: Hymeneus and Alexander are
delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme, when one would
rather think they would learn of Satan to blaspheme the more. (3.) Those
who have put away a good conscience, and made shipwreck of faith, will
not stick at any thing, blasphemy not excepted. (4.) Therefore let us
hold faith and a good conscience, if we would keep clear of blasphemy;
for, if we once let go our hold of these, we do not know where we shall
stop.
