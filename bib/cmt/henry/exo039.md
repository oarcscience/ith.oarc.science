### [Exodus Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 39:0</span></span>

This chapter gives us an account of the finishing of the work of the
tabernacle. I. The last things prepared were the holy garments. The
ephod and its curious girdle ([Exo
39:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#001).md). The onyx-stones for the
shoulders ([Exo 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#006.md), [Exo
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#007).md). The breastplate with the
precious stones in it ([Exo 39:8-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#008).md).
The robe of the ephod ([Exo 39:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#022).md).
The coats, bonnets, and breeches, for the inferior priests ([Exo
39:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#027).md). And the plate of the holy
crown ([Exo 39:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#030.md), [Exo
39:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#031).md). II. A summary account of the
whole work, as it was presented to Moses when it was all finished ([Exo
39:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#032), etc..md).

[Exodus 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 39:1</span></span>

In this account of the making of the priests' garments, according to the
instructions given (ch. 28), we may observe, 1. That the priests'
garments are called here clothes of service, [Exo
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#001.md). Note, Those that wear robes of
honour must look upon them as clothes of service; for from those upon
whom honour is put service is expected. It is said of those that are
arrayed in white robes that they are before the throne of God, and serve
him day and night in his temple, [Rev
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#013.md), [Rev
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#015.md). Holy garments were not made for
men to sleep in, or to strut in, but to do service in; and then they are
indeed for glory and beauty. The Son of man himself came not to be
ministered unto, but to minister. 2. That all the six paragraphs here,
which give a distinct account of the making of these holy garments,
conclude with those words, as the Lord commanded Moses, [Exo
39:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#005.md), [Exo
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#007.md), [Exo
39:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#021.md), [Exo
39:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#026.md), [Exo
39:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#029.md), [Exo
39:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#031.md). The like is not in any of the
foregoing accounts, as if in these, more than any other of the
appurtenances of the tabernacle, they had a particular regard to the
divine appointment, both for warrant and for direction. It is an
intimation to all the Lord's ministers to make the word of God their
rule in all their ministrations, and to act in observance of and
obedience to the command of God. 3. That these garments, in conformity
to the rest of the furniture of the tabernacle, were very rich and
splendid; the church in its infancy was thus taught, thus pleased, with
the rudiments of this world; but now under the gospel, which is the
ministration of the Spirit, to affect and impose such pompous habits as
the church of Rome does, under pretence of decency and instruction, is
to betray the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, and to entangle
the church again in the bondage of those carnal ordinances which were
imposed only till the time of reformation. 4. That they were all shadows
of good things to come, but the substance is Christ, and the grace of
the gospel; when therefore the substance has come, it is a jest to be
fond of the shadow. (1.) Christ is our great high-priest; when he
undertook the work of our redemption, he put on the clothes of service -
he arrayed himself with the gifts and graces of the Spirit, which he
received not by measure - girded himself with the curious girdle of
resolution, to go through with his undertaking - charged himself with
the curious girdle of resolution, to go through with his undertaking -
charged himself with all God's spiritual Israel, bore them on his
shoulders, carried them in his bosom, laid them near his heart, engraved
them on the palms of his hands, and presented them in the breast-plate
of judgment unto his Father. And (lastly) he crowned himself with
holiness to the Lord, consecrating his whole undertaking to the honour
of his Father's holiness: now consider how great this man is. (2.) True
believers are spiritual priests. The clean linen with which all their
clothes of service must be made is the righteousness of saints ([Rev
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008).md), and Holiness to the Lord must
be so written upon their foreheads that all who converse with them may
see, and say, that they bear the image of God's holiness, and are
devoted to the praise of it.

[Exodus 39:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">exo 39:32</span></span>

Observe here, I. The builders of the tabernacle made very good despatch.
It was not much more than five months from the beginning to the
finishing of it. Though there was a great deal of fine work about it,
such as is usually the work of time, embroidering and engraving, not
only in gold, but in precious stones, yet they went through with it in a
little time. Church-work is usually slow work, but they made quick work
of this, and yet did it with the greatest exactness imaginable. For, 1.
Many hands were employed, all unanimous, and not striving with each
other. This expedited the business, and made it easy. 2. The workmen
were taught of God, and so were kept from making blunders, which would
have retarded them. 3. The people were hearty and zealous in the work,
and impatient till it was finished. God had prepared their hearts, and
then the thing was done suddenly, [Ch2
29:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#036.md). Resolution and industry, and a
cheerful application of mind, will, by the grace of God, bring a great
deal of good work to pass in a little time, in less than one would
expect.

II\. They punctually observed their orders, and did not in the least
vary from them. They did it according to all that the Lord commanded
Moses, [Exo 39:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#032.md), [Exo
39:42](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#042.md). Note, God's work must be done,
in every thing, according to his own will. His institutions neither need
nor admit men's inventions to make them either more beautiful or more
likely to answer the intention of them. Add thou not unto his words. God
is pleased with willing worship, but not with will-worship.

III\. They brought all their work to Moses, and submitted it to his
inspection and censure, [Exo 39:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#033.md). He
knew what he had ordered them to make; and now the particulars were
called over, and all produced, that Moses might see both that they had
made all, omitting nothing, and that they had made all according to the
instructions given them, and that, if they had made a mistake in any
thing, it might be forthwith rectified. Thus they showed respect to
Moses, who was set over them in the Lord; not objecting that Moses did
not understand such work, and therefore that there was no reason for
submitting it to his judgment. No, that God who gave them so much
knowledge as to do the work gave them also so much humility as to be
willing to have it examined and compared with the model. Moses was in
authority, and they would pay a deference to his place. The spirit of
the prophets is subject to the prophets. And besides, though they knew
how to do the work better than Moses, Moses had a better and more exact
idea of the model than they had, and therefore they could not be well
pleased with their own work, unless they had his approbation. Thus in
all the services of religion we should labour to be accepted of the
Lord.

IV\. Moses, upon search, found all done according to the rule, [Exo
39:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#043.md). Moses, both for their
satisfaction and for his own, did look upon all the work, piece by
piece, and behold they had done it according to the pattern shown him,
for the same Being that showed him the pattern guided their hand in the
work. All the copies of God's grace exactly agree with the original of
his counsels: what God works in us, and by us, is the fulfilling of the
good pleasure of his own goodness; and when the mystery of God shall be
finished, and all his performances come to be compared with his
purposes, it will appear that behold all is done according to the
counsel of his own will, not one iota or tittle of which shall fall to
the ground, or be varied from.

V. Moses blessed them. 1. He commended them, and signified his
approbation of all they had done. He did not find fault where there was
none, as some do, who think they disparage their own judgment if they do
not find something amiss in the best and most accomplished performance.
In all this work it is probable there might have been found here and
there a stitch amiss, and a stroke awry, which would have served for an
over-curious and censorious critic to animadvert upon; but Moses was too
candid to notice small faults where there were no great ones. Note, All
governors must be a praise to those that do well, as well as a terror to
evil-doers. Why should any take a pride in being hard to be pleased? 2.
He not only praised them, but prayed for them. He blessed them as one
having authority, for the less is blessed of the better. We read not of
any wages that Moses paid them for their work, but this blessing he gave
them. For, though ordinarily the labourer be worthy of his hire, yet in
this case, 1. They wrought for themselves. The honour and comfort of
God's tabernacle among them would be recompence enough. If thou be wise,
thou shalt be wise for thyself. 2. They had their meat from heaven on
free-cost, for themselves and their families, and their raiment waxed
not old upon them; so that they neither needed wages nor had reason to
expect any. Freely you have received, freely give. The obligations we
lie under, both in duty and interest, to serve God, should be sufficient
to quicken us to our work, though we had not a reward in prospect. But,
3. This blessing, in the name of the Lord, was wages enough for all
their work. Those whom God employs he will bless, and those whom he
blesses are blessed indeed. The blessing he commands is life for
evermore.
