### [Nehemiah Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">neh 12:0</span></span>

In this chapter are preserved upon record, I. The names of the chief of
the priests and the Levites that came up with Zerubbabel ([Neh
12:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#001).md). II. The succession of the
high priests ([Neh 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#010.md), [Neh
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#011).md). III. The names of the next
generation of the other chief priests ([Neh
12:12-21](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#012).md). IV. The eminent Levites
that were in Nehemiah's time ([Neh
12:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#022).md). V. The solemnity of
dedicating the wall of Jerusalem (v. 27-43). VI. The settling of the
offices of the priests and Levites in the temple ([Neh
12:44-47](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#044).md).

[Nehemiah 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 12:1</span></span>

We have here the names, and little more than the names, of a great many
priests and Levites, that were eminent in their day among the returned
Jews. Why this register should be here inserted by Nehemiah does not
appear, perhaps to keep in remembrance those good men, that posterity
might know to whom they were beholden, under God, for the happy revival
and re-establishment of their religion among them. Thus must we
contribute towards the performance of that promise, [Psa
112:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#006.md), The righteous shall be in
everlasting remembrance. Let the memory of the just be blessed, be
perpetuated. It is a debt we still owe to faithful ministers to remember
our guides, who have spoken to us the word of God, [Heb
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007.md). Perhaps it is intended to stir
up their posterity, who succeeded them in the priest's office and
inherited their dignities and preferments, to imitate their courage and
fidelity. It is good to know what our godly ancestors and predecessors
were, that we may learn thereby what we should be. We have here, 1. The
names of the priests and Levites that came up with the first out of
Babylon, when Jeshua was high priest. Jeremiah and Ezra are mentioned
with the first ([Neh 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#001).md), but, it is
supposed, not Jeremiah the prophet nor Ezra the scribe; the fame of the
one was long before and that of the other some time after, though both
of them were priests. Of one of the Levites it is said ([Neh
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#008).md) that he was over the
thanksgiving, that is, he was entrusted to see that the psalms, the
thanksgiving psalms, were constantly sung in the temple in due time and
manner. The Levites kept their turns in their watches, reliving one
another as becomes brethren, fellow-labourers, and fellow-soldiers. 2.
The succession of high priests during the Persian monarchy, from Jeshua
(or Jesus), who was high priest at the time of the restoration, to
Jaddua (or Jaddus), who was high priest when Alexander the Great, after
the conquest of Tyre, came to Jerusalem, and paid great respect to this
Jaddus, who met him in his pontifical habit, and showed him the prophecy
of Daniel, which foretold his conquests. 3. The next generation of
priests, who were chief men, and active in the days of Joiakim, sons of
the first set. Note, We have reason to acknowledge God's favour to his
church, and care of it, in that, as one generation of ministers passes
away, another comes. All those who are mentioned [Neh
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#001.md), etc., as eminent in their
generation, are again mentioned, though with some variation in several
of the names, [Neh 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#012.md), etc., except
two, as having sons that were likewise eminent in their generation - a
rare instance, that twenty good fathers should leave behind them twenty
good sons (for so many here are) that filled up their places. 4. The
next generation of Levites, or rather a latter generation; for those
priests who are mentioned flourished in the days of Joiakim the high
priest, these Levites in the days of Eliashib, [Neh
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#022.md). Perhaps then the forementioned
families of the priests began to degenerate, and the third generation of
them came short of the first two; but the work of God shall never fail
for want of instruments. Then a generation of Levites was raised up, who
were recorded chief of the fathers ([Neh
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#022).md), and were eminently serviceable
to the interests of the church, and their service not the less
acceptable either to God or to his people for their being Levites only,
of the lower rank of ministers. Eliashib the high priest being allied to
Tobiah ([Neh 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#004).md), the other priests
grew remiss; but then the Levites appeared the more zealous, as appears
by this, that those who were now employed in expounding ([Neh
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#007).md) and in praying ([Neh
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#004.md), [Neh
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#005).md) were all Levites, not priests,
regard being had to their personal qualifications more than to their
order. These Levites were some of them singers ([Neh
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#024).md), to praise and give thanks,
others of them porters ([Neh 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#025).md),
keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates, and both according to
the command of David.

[Nehemiah 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">neh 12:27</span></span>

We have read of the building of the wall of Jerusalem with a great deal
of fear and trembling; we have here an account of the dedicating of it
with a great deal of joy and triumph. Those that sow in tears shall thus
reap.

I. We must enquire what was the meaning of this dedication of the wall;
we will suppose it to include the dedication of the city too (continens
pro contentothe thing containing for the thing contained), and therefore
it was not done till the city was pretty well replenished, [Neh
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001.md). It was a solemn thanksgiving to
God for his great mercy to them in the perfecting of this undertaking,
of which they were the more sensible because of the difficulty and
opposition they had met with in it. 2. They hereby devoted the city in a
peculiar manner to God and to his honour, and took possession of it for
him and in his name. All our cities, all our houses, must have holiness
to the Lord written upon them; but this city was (so as never any other
was) a holy city, the city of the great King ([Psa
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002.md) and [Mat
5:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#035).md): it had been so ever since God
chose it to put his name there, and as such, it being now refitted, it
was afresh dedicated to God by the builders and inhabitants, in token of
their acknowledgment that they were his tenants, and their desire that
it might still be is and that the property of it might never be altered.
Whatever is done for their safety, ease, and comfort, must be designed
for God's honour and glory. 3. They hereby put the city and its walls
under the divine protection, owning that unless the Lord kept the city
the walls were built in vain. When this city was in possession of the
Jebusites, they committed the guardianship of it to their gods, though
they were blind and lame ones, [Sa2
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006.md). With much more reason do the
people of God commit it to his keeping who is all-wise and almighty. The
superstitious founders of cities had an eye to the lucky position of the
heavens (see Mr. Gregory's works, p. 29, etc.); but these pious founders
had an eye to God only, to his providence, and not to fortune.

II\. We must observe with what solemnity it was performed, under the
direction of [Neh 1:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md). The Levites
from all parts of the country were summoned to attend. The city must be
dedicated to God, and therefore his ministers must be employed in the
dedicating of it, and the surrender must pass through their hands. When
those solemn feasts were over (ch. 8 and 9) they went home to their
respective posts, to mind their cures in the country; but now their
presence and assistance were again called for. 2. Pursuant to this
summons, there was a general rendezvous of all the Levites, [Neh
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#028.md), [Neh
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#029.md). Observe in what method they
proceeded. (1.) They purified themselves, [Neh
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#030.md). We are concerned to cleanse our
hands, and purify our hearts, when any work for God is to pass through
them. They purified themselves and then the people. Those that would be
instrumental to sanctify others must sanctify themselves, and set
themselves apart for God, with purity of mind and sincerity of
intention. Then they purified the gates and the wall. Then may we expect
comfort when we are prepared to receive it. To the pure all things are
pure ([Tit 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015).md); and, to those who
are sanctified, houses and tables, and all their creature comforts and
enjoyments, are sanctified, [Ti1 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#004.md),
[Ti1 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#005.md). This purification was
performed, it is probable, by sprinkling the water of purifying (or of
separation, as it is called, [Num
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#009).md) on themselves and the people,
the walls and the gates - a type of the blood of Christ, with which our
consciences being purged from dead works, we become fit to serve the
living God ([Heb 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014).md) and to be his
care. (2.) The princes, priests, and Levites, walked round upon the wall
in two companies, with musical instruments, to signify the dedication of
it all to God, the whole circuit of it ([Neh
12:36](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#036).md); so that it is likely they sung
psalms as they went along, to the praise and glory of God. This
procession is here largely described. They had a rendezvous at one
certain lace, where they divided themselves into two companies. Half of
the princes, with several priests and Levites, went on the right hand,
Ezra leading their van, [Neh 12:36](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#036.md).
The other half of the princes and priests, who gave thanks likewise,
went to the left hand, Nehemiah bringing up the rear, [Neh
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#038.md). At length both companies met in
the temple, where they joined their thanksgivings, [Neh
12:40](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#040.md). The crowd of people, it is
likely, walked on the ground, some within the wall and others without,
one end of this ceremony being to affect them with the mercy they were
giving thanks for, and to perpetuate the remembrance of it among them.
Processions, for such purposes, have their use. (3.) The people greatly
rejoiced, [Neh 12:43](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#043.md). While the
princes, priests, and Levites, testified their joy and thankfulness by
great sacrifices, sound of trumpet, musical instruments, and songs of
praise, the common people testified theirs by loud shouts, which were
heard afar off, further than the more harmonious sound of their songs
and music: and these shouts, coming from a sincere and hearty joy, are
here taken notice of; for God overlooks not, but graciously accepts, the
honest zealous services of mean people, though there is in them little
of art and they are far from being fine. It is observed that the women
and children rejoiced; and their hosannas were not despised, but
recorded to their praise. All that share in public mercies ought to join
in public thanksgivings. The reason given is that God had made them
rejoice with great joy. He had given them both matter for joy and hearts
to rejoice; his providence had made them safe and easy, and then his
grace made them cheerful and thankful. The baffled opposition of their
enemies, no doubt, added to their joy and mixed triumph with it. Great
mercies call for the most solemn returns of praise, in the courts of the
Lord's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem!

[Nehemiah 12:44](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">neh 12:44</span></span>

We have here an account of the remaining good effects of the universal
joy that was at the dedication of the wall. When the solemnities of a
thanksgiving day leave such impressions on ministers and people as that
both are more careful and cheerful in doing their duty afterwards, then
they are indeed acceptable to God and turn to a good account. So it was
here. 1. The ministers were more careful than they had been of their
work; the respect the people paid them upon this occasion encouraged
them to diligence and watchfulness, [Neh
12:45](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#045.md). The singers kept the ward of
their God, attending in due time to the duty of their office; the
porters, too, kept the ward of the purification, that is, they took care
to preserve the purity of the temple by denying admission to those that
were ceremonially unclean. When the joy of the Lord thus engages us to
our duty, and enlarges us in it, it is then an earnest of that joy
which, in concurrence with the perfection of holiness, will be our
everlasting bliss. 2. The people were more careful than they had been of
the maintenance of their ministers. The people, at the dedication of the
wall, among other things which they made matter of their joy, rejoiced
for the priests and for the Levites that waited, [Neh
12:44](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#044.md). They had a great deal of
comfort in their ministers, and were glad of them. When they observed
how diligently they waited, and what pains they took in their work, they
rejoiced in them. Note, The surest way for ministers to recommend
themselves to their people, and gain an interest in their affections, is
to wait on their ministry ([Rom 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#007).md),
to be humble and industrious, and to mind their business. When these did
so the people thought nothing too much to do for them, to encourage
them. The law had provided then their portions ([Neh
12:44](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#044).md), but what the better were they
for that provision if what the law appointed them either was not duly
collected or not justly paid to them? Now, (1.) Care is here taken for
the collecting of their dues. They were modest, and would rather lose
their right than call for it themselves. The people were many of them
careless and would not bring their dues unless they were called upon;
and therefore some were appointed whose office it should be to gather
into the treasuries, out of the fields of the cities, the portions of
the law for the priests and Levites ([Neh
12:44](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#044).md), that their portion might not
be lost for want of being demanded. This is a piece of good service both
to ministers and people, that the one may not come short of their
maintenance nor the other of their duty. (2.) Care is taken that, being
gathered in, they might be duly paid out, [Neh
12:47](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#047.md). They gave the singers and
porters their daily portion, over and above what was due to them as
Levites; for we may suppose that when David and Solomon appointed them
their work ([Neh 12:45](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#045.md), [Neh
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#046).md), above what was required from
them as Levites, they settled a fund for their further encouragement.
Let those that labour more abundantly in the word and doctrine be
counted worthy of this double honour. As for the other Levites, the
tithes, here called the holy things, were duly set apart for them, out
of which they paid the priests their tithe according to the law. Both
are said to be sanctified; when what is contributed, either voluntarily
or by law, for the support of religion and the maintenance of the
ministry, is given with an eye to God and his honour, it is sanctified,
and shall be accepted of him accordingly, and it will cause the blessing
to rest on the house and all that is in it, [Eze
44:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#030.md).
