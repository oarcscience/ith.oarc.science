### [Psalms Chapter 140](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 140:0</span></span>

This and the four following psalms are much of a piece, and the scope of
them the same with many that we met with in the beginning and middle of
the book of Psalms, though with but few of late. They were penned by
David (as it should seem) when he was persecuted by Saul; one of them is
said to be his "prayer when he was in the cave," and it is probable that
all the rest were penned about the same time. In this psalm, I. David
complains of the malice of his enemies, and prays to God to preserve him
from them ([Psa 140:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001).md). II. He
encourages himself in God as his God ([Psa
140:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#006.md), [Psa
140:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#007).md). III. He prays for, and
prophesies, the destruction of his persecutors ([Psa
140:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#008).md). IV. He assures all God's
afflicted people that their troubles would in due time end well ([Psa
140:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#012.md), [Psa
140:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#013).md), with which assurance we must
comfort ourselves, and one another, in singing this psalm.

To the chief musician. A psalm of David.

[Psalms 140:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 140:1</span></span>

In this, as in other things, David was a type of Christ, that he
suffered before he reigned, was humbled before he was exalted, and that
as there were many who loved and valued him, and sought to do him
honour, so there were many who hated and envied him, and sought to do
him mischief, as appears by these verses, where,

I. He gives a character of his enemies, and paints them out in their own
colours, as dangerous men, whom he had reason to be afraid of, but
wicked men, whom he had no reason to think the righteous God would
countenance. There was one that seems to have been the ring-leader of
them, whom he calls the evil man and the man of violences ([Psa
140:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001.md), [Psa
140:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#004).md), probably he means Saul. The
Chaldee paraphrast ([Psa 140:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#009).md) names
both Doeg and Ahithophel; but between them there was a great distance of
time. Violent men are evil men. But there were many besides this one who
were confederate against David, who are here represented as the genuine
offspring and seed of the serpent. For, 1. They are very subtle, crafty
to do mischief; they have imagined it ([Psa
140:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#002).md), have laid the scheme with all
the art and cunning imaginable. They have purposed and plotted to
overthrow the goings of a good man ([Psa
140:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#004).md), to draw him into sin and
trouble, to ruin him by blasting his reputation, crushing his interest,
and taking away his life. For this purpose they have, like mighty
hunters, hidden a snare, and spread a net, and set gins ([Psa
140:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#005).md), that their designs against
him, being kept undiscovered, might be the more likely to take effect,
and he might fall into their hands ere he was aware. Great persecutors
have often been great politicians, which has indeed made them the more
formidable; but the Lord preserves the simple without all those arts. 2.
They are very spiteful, as full of malice as Satan himself: They have
sharpened their tongues like a serpent, that infuses his venom with his
tongue; and there is so much malignity in all they say that one would
think there was nothing under their lips but adders' poison, [Psa
140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003.md). With their calumnies, and with
their counsels, they aimed to destroy David, but secretly, as a man is
stung with a serpent, or a snake in the grass. And they endeavoured
likewise to infuse their malice into others, and to make them seven
times more the children of hell than themselves. A malignant tongue
makes men like the old serpent; and poison in the lips is a certain sign
of poison in the heart. 3. They are confederate; they are many of them;
but they are all gathered together against me for war, [Psa
140:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#002.md). Those who can agree in nothing
else can agree to persecute a good man. Herod and Pilate will unite in
this, and in this they resemble Satan, who is not divided against
himself, all the devils agreeing in Beelzebub. 4. They are proud ([Psa
140:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#005).md), conceited of themselves and
confident of their success; and herein also they resemble Satan, whose
reigning ruining sin was pride. The pride of persecutors, though at
present it be the terror, yet may be the encouragement, of the
persecuted, for the more haughty they are the faster are they ripening
for ruin. Pride goes before destruction.

II\. He prays to God to keep him from them and from being swallowed up
by them: "Lord, deliver me, preserve me, keep me ([Psa
140:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001.md), [Psa
140:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#004).md); let them not prevail to take
away my life, my reputation, my interest, my comfort, and to prevent my
coming to the throne. Keep me from doing as they do, or as they would
have me do, or as they promise themselves I shall do." Note, The more
malice appears in our enemies against us the more earnest we should be
in prayer to God to take us under his protection. In him believers may
count upon a security, and may enjoy it and themselves with a holy
serenity. Those are safe whom God preserves. If he be for us, who can be
against us?

III\. He triumphs in God, and thereby, in effect, he triumphs over his
persecutors, [Psa 140:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#006.md), [Psa
140:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#007.md). When his enemies sharpened
their tongues against him, did he sharpen his against them? No; adders'
poison was under their lips, but grace was poured into his lips, witness
what he here said unto the Lord, for to him he looked, to him he
directed himself, when he saw himself in so much danger, through the
malice of his enemies: and it is well for us that we have a God to go
to. He comforted himself, 1. In his interest in God: "I said, Thou art
my God; and, if my God, then my shield and mighty protector." In
troublous dangerous times it is good to claim relation to God, and by
faith to keep hold of him. 2. In his access to God. This comforted him,
that he was not only taken into covenant with God, but into communion
with him, that he had leave to speak to him, and might expect an answer
of peace from him, and could say, with a humble confidence, Hear the
voice of my supplications, O Lord! 3. In the assurance he had of help
from God and happiness in him: "O God the Lord - Jehovah Adonai! as
Jehovah thou art self-existent and self-sufficient, an infinitely
perfect being; as Adonai thou art my stay and support, my ruler and
governor, and therefore the strength of my salvation, my strong Saviour;
nay, not only my Saviour, but my salvation itself, from whom, in whom,
my salvation is; not only a strong Saviour, but the very strength of my
salvation, on whom the stress of my hope is laid; all in all, to make me
happy, and to preserve me to my happiness." 4. In the experience he had
had formerly of God's care of him: Thou hast covered my head in the day
of battle. As he pleaded with Saul, that, for the service of his
country, he many a time jeoparded his life in the high places of the
field, so he pleads with God that, in those services, he had wonderfully
protected him, and provided him a better helmet for the securing of his
head than Goliath's was: "Lord, thou hast kept me in the day of battle
with the Philistines, suffer me not to fall by the treacherous intrigues
of false-hearted Israelites." God is as able to preserve his people from
secret fraud as from open force; and the experience we have had of his
power and care, in dangers of one kind, may encourage us to trust in him
and depend upon him in dangers of another nature; for nothing can
shorten the Lord's right hand.

[Psalms 140:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 140:8</span></span>

Here is the believing foresight David had,

I. Of the shame and confusion of persecutors.

1\. Their disappointment. This he prays for ([Psa
140:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#008).md), that their lusts might not be
gratified, their lust of ambition, envy, and revenge: "Grant not, O
Lord! the desires of the wicked, but frustrate them; let them not see
the ruin of my interest, which they so earnestly wish to see; but hear
the voice of my supplications." He prays that their projects might not
take effect, but be blasted: "O further not his wicked device; let not
Providence favour any of his designs, but cross them; suffer not his
wicked device to proceed, but chain his wheels, and stop him in the
career of his pursuits." Thus we are to pray against the enemies of
God's people, that they may not succeed in any of their enterprises.
Such was David's prayer against Ahithophel, that God would turn his
counsels into foolishness. The plea is, lest they exalt themselves,
value themselves upon their success as if it were an evidence that God
favoured them. Proud men, when they prosper, are made prouder, grow more
impudent against God and insolent against his people, and therefore,
"Lord, do not prosper them."

2\. Their destruction. This he prays for (as we read it); but some
choose to read it rather as a prophecy, and the original will bear it.
If we take it as a prayer, that proceeds from a spirit of prophecy,
which comes all to one. He foretels the ruin,

(1.) Of his own enemies: "As for those that compass me about, and seek
my ruin," \[1.\] "The mischief of their own lips shall cover their heads
([Psa 140:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#009).md); the evil they have
wished to me shall come upon themselves, their curses shall be blown
back into their own faces, and the very designs which they have laid
against me shall turn to their own ruin," [Psa
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#015.md), [Psa
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#016.md). Let those that make mischief, by
slandering, tale-bearing, misrepresenting their neighbours, and
spreading ill-natured characters and stories, dread the consequence of
it, and think how sad their condition will be when all the mischief they
have been accessory to shall be made to return upon themselves. \[2.\]
The judgments of God shall fall upon them, compared here to burning
coals, in allusion to the destruction of Sodom; nay, as in the deluge
the waters from above, and those from beneath, met for the drowning of
the world, both the windows of heaven were opened and the fountains of
the great deep were broken up, so here, to complete the ruin of the
enemies of Christ and his kingdom, they shall not only have burning
coals cast upon them from above ([Job
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#023.md); [Job
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#022).md), but they themselves shall be
cast into the fire beneath; both heaven and hell, the wrath of God the
Judge and the rage of Satan the tormentor, shall concur to make them
miserable. And the fire they shall be cast into is not a furnace of
fire, out of which perhaps they might escape, but a deep pit, out of
which they cannot rise. Tophet is said to be deep and large, [Isa
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033.md).

(2.) Of all others that are like them, [Psa
140:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#011.md). \[1.\] Evil speakers must
expect to be shaken, for they shall never be established in the earth.
What is got by fraud and falsehood, by calumny and unjust accusation,
will not prosper, will not last. Wealth gotten by vanity will be
diminished. Let not such men as Doeg think to reign long, for his doom
will be theirs, [Psa 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005.md). A lying
tongue is but for a moment, but the lip of truth shall be established
for ever. \[2.\] Evil doers must expect to be destroyed: Evil shall hunt
the violent man, as the blood-hound hunts the murderer to discover him,
as the lion hunts his prey to tear it to pieces. Mischievous men will be
brought to light, and brought to ruin; the destruction appointed shall
run them down and overthrow them. Evil pursues sinners.

II\. Here is his foresight of the deliverance and comfort of the
persecuted, [Psa 140:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#012.md), [Psa
140:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#013.md). 1. God will do those justice,
in delivering them, who, being wronged, commit themselves to him: "I
know that the Lord will maintain the just and injured cause of his
afflicted people, and will not suffer might always to prevail against
right, though it be but the right of the poor, who have but little that
they can pretend a right to." God is, and will be, the patron of
oppressed innocence, much more of persecuted piety; those that know him
cannot but know this. 2. They will do him justice (if I may so speak),
in ascribing the glory of their deliverance to him: "Surely the
righteous (who make conscience of rendering to God his due, as well as
to men theirs) shall give thanks unto thy name when they find their
cause pleaded with jealousy and prosecuted with effect." The closing
words, The upright shall dwell in thy presence, denote both God's favour
to them ("Thou shalt admit them to dwell in thy presence in grace here,
in glory hereafter, and it shall be their safety and happiness") and
their duty to God: "They shall attend upon thee as servants that keep in
the presence of their masters, both to do them honour and to receive
their commands." This is true thanksgiving, even thanksliving; and this
use we should make of all our deliverance, we should serve God the more
closely and cheerfully.
