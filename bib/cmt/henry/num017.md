### [Numbers Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 17:0</span></span>

Enough had been done in the chapter before to quash all pretensions of
the families of the tribe of Levi that would set up in competition with
Aaron, and to make it appear that Aaron was the head of the tribe; but
it seems, when that matter was settled, the princes of the rest of the
tribes began to murmur. If the head of a tribe must be a priest, why not
the head of some other tribe than that of Levi? He that searches the
heart knew this thought to be in the breast of some of them, and before
it broke out into any overt act graciously anticipated it, to prevent
bloodshed; and it is done by miracle in this chapter, not a miracle of
wrath, as before, but of grace. I. The matter is put upon trial by the
bringing of twelve rods, one for each prince, before the Lord ([Num
17:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#001).md). II. Upon trial, the matter is
determined by the miraculous blossoming of Aaron's rod ([Num
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#008.md), [Num
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#009).md). III. The decision of the
controversy is registered by the preservation of the rod ([Num
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#010.md), [Num
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#011).md). IV. The people acquiesce in it
with some reluctance ([Num 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#012.md), [Num
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#013).md).

[Numbers 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 17:1</span></span>

Here we have, I. Orders given for the bringing in of a rod for every
tribe (which was peculiarly significant, for the word here used for a
rod sometimes signifies a tribe, as particularly [Num
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#013).md), that God by a miracle, wrought
on purpose, might make it known on whom he had conferred the honour of
the priesthood. 1. It seems then the priesthood was a preferment worth
seeking and striving for, even by the princes of the tribes. It is an
honour to the greatest of men to be employed in the service of God. Yet
perhaps these contended for it rather for the sake of the profit and
power that attended the office than for the sake of that in it which was
divine and sacred. 2. It seems likewise, after all that had been done to
settle this matter, there were those who would be ready upon any
occasion to contest it. They would not acquiesce in the divine
appointment, but would make an interest in opposition to it. They strive
with God for the dominion; and the question is whose will shall stand.
God will rule, but Israel will not be ruled; and this is the quarrel. 3.
It is an instance of the grace of God that, having wrought divers
miracles to punish sin, he would work one more on purpose to prevent it.
God has effectually provided that the obstinate shall be left
inexcusable, and every mouth shall be stopped. Israel were very prone to
murmur both against God and against their governors. "Now," said God, "I
will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel,
[Num 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#005.md). If any thing will convince
them, they shall be convinced; and, if this will not convince them,
nothing will." This was to be to them, as Christ said the sign of the
prophet Jonas (that is, his own resurrection) should be to the men of
that generation, the highest proof of his mission that should be given
them. The directions are, (1.) That twelve rods or staves should be
brought in. It is probable that they were not now fresh cut out of a
tree, for then the miracle would not have been so great; but that they
were the staves which the princes ordinarily used as ensigns of their
authority (of which we read [Num
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#018).md), old dry staves, that had no
sap in them, and it is probable that they were all made of the
almond-tree. It should seem they were but twelve in all, with Aaron's,
for, when Levi comes into the account, Ephraim and Manasseh make but
one, under the name of Joseph. (2.) That the name of each prince should
be written upon his rod, that every man might know his own, and to
prevent contests. Writing is often a good preservative against strife,
for what is written may be appealed to. (3.) That they should be laid up
in the tabernacle, for one night, before the testimony, that is, before
the ark, which, with its mercy seat, was a symbol, token, or testimony,
of God's presence with them. (4.) They were to expect, being told it
before, that the rod of the tribe, or prince, whom God chose to the
priesthood, should bud and blossom, [Num
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#005.md). It was requisite that they
should be told of it, that it might appear not to be casual, but
according to the counsel and will of God.

II\. The preparing of the rods accordingly. The princes brought them in,
some of them perhaps fondly expecting that the choice would fall upon
them, and all of them thinking it honour enough to be competitors with
Aaron, and to stand candidates, even for the priesthood ([Num
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#007).md); and Moses laid them up before
the Lord. He did not object that the matter was sufficiently settled
already, and enough done to convince those that were not invincibly
hardened in their prejudices. He did not undertake to determine the
controversy himself, though it might easily have been done; nor did he
suggest that it would be to no purpose to offer satisfaction to a people
that were willingly blind. But, since God will have it so, he did his
part, and lodged the case before the Lord, to whom the appeal was made
by consent, and left it with him.

[Numbers 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 17:8</span></span>

Here is, I. The final determination of the controversy concerning the
priesthood by a miracle, [Num 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#008.md),
[Num 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#009.md). The rods or staves were
brought out from the most holy place where they were laid up, and
publicly produced before the people; and, while all the rest of the rods
remained as they were, Aaron's rod only, of a dry stick, became a living
branch, budded, and blossomed, and yielded almonds. In some places there
were buds, in others blossoms, in others fruit, at the same time. This
was miraculous, and took away all suspicion of a fraud, as if in the
night Moses had taken away Aaron's rod, and put a living branch of an
almond tree in the room of it; for no ordinary branch would have buds,
blossoms, and fruits upon it, all at once. Now,

1\. This was a plain indication to the people that Aaron was chosen to
the priesthood, and not any other of the princes of the tribes. Thus he
was distinguished from them and manifested to be under the special
blessing of heaven, which sometimes yields increase where there is
neither planting nor watering by the hand of man. Bishop Hall here
observes that fruitfulness is the best evidence of a divine call, and
that the plants of God's setting, and the boughs cut off from them, will
flourish. See [Psa 92:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012.md). The trees
of the Lord, though they seem dry trees, are full of sap.

2\. It was a very proper sign to represent the priesthood itself, which
was hereby confirmed to Aaron. (1.) That it should be fruitful and
serviceable to the church of God. It produced not only blossoms, but
almonds; for the priesthood was designed, not only for an honour to
Aaron, but for a blessing to Israel. Thus Christ ordained his apostles
and ministers that they should go and bring forth fruit, and that their
fruit should remain, [Joh 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016). (2..md)
That there should be a succession of priests. Here were not only almonds
for the present, but buds and blossoms promising more hereafter. Thus
has Christ provided in his church that a seed should serve him from
generation to generation. (3.) That yet this priesthood should not be
perpetual, but in process of time, like the branches and blossoms of a
tree, should fail and wither. The flourishing of the almond-tree is
mentioned as one of the signs of old age, [Ecc
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#005.md). This character was betimes put
upon the Mosaic priesthood, which soon became old and ready to vanish
away, [Heb 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#013.md).

3\. It was a type and figure of Christ and his priesthood: for he is the
man, the branch, that is to be a priest upon his throne, as it follows
([Zac 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012).md); and he was to grow up
before God, as this before the ark, like a tender plant, and a root out
of a dry ground, [Isa 53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002.md).

II\. The record of this determination, by the preserving of the rod
before the testimony, in perpetuam rei memoriam - that it might be had
in perpetual remembrance, [Num 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#010.md),
[Num 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#011.md). It is probable that the
buds, and blossoms, and fruit, continued fresh; the same divine power
that produced them in a night preserved them for ages, at least so long
as it was necessary for a token against the rebels. So it was a standing
miracle, and the continuance of it was an undeniable proof of the truth
of it. Even the leaf of God's trees shall not wither, [Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md). This rod was preserved, as the
censers were, to take away their murmurings, that they die not. Note, 1.
The design of God in all his providences, both mercies and judgments,
and in the memorials of them, is to take away sin, and to prevent it.
These things are done, these things written, that we sin not, [Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001.md). Christ was manifested to take
away sin. 2. What God does for the taking away of sin is done in real
kindness to us, that we die not. All the bitter potions he gives, and
all the sharp methods he uses with us, are for the cure of a disease
which otherwise would certainly be fatal. Bishop Hall observes here that
the tables of the law, the pot of manna, and Aaron's rod, were preserved
together in or about the ark (the apostle takes notice of them all three
together, [Heb 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004).md), to show to
after-ages how the ancient church was taught, and fed, and ruled; and he
infers how precious the doctrine, sacraments, and government, of the
church are to God and should be to us. The rod of Moses was used in
working many miracles, yet we do not find that this was preserved, for
the keeping of it would serve only to gratify men's curiosity; but the
rod of Aaron, which carried its miracle along with it, was carefully
preserved, because that would be of standing use to convince men's
consciences, to silence all disputes about the priesthood, and to
confirm the faith of God's Israel in his institutions. Such is the
difference between the sacraments which Christ has appointed for
edification and the relics which men have devised for superstition.

III\. The outcry of the people hereupon ([Num
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#012.md), [Num
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#013).md): Behold, we die, we perish, we
all perish. Shall we be consumed with dying? This may be considered as
the language either, 1. Of a repining people quarrelling with the
judgments of God, which, by their own pride and obstinacy, they had
brought upon themselves. They seem to speak despairingly, as if God was
a hard Master, that sought advantage against them, and took all
occasions to pick quarrels with them, so that if they trod every so
little awry, if they stepped ever so little beyond their bounds, they
must die, they must perish, they must all perish, basely insinuating
that God would never be satisfied with their blood and ruin, till he had
made an end of them all and they were consumed with dying. Thus they
seem to be like a wild bull in a net, full of the fury of the Lord ([Isa
51:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#020).md), fretting that God was too hard
for them and that they were forced to submit, which they did only
because they could not help it. Note, It is a very wicked thing to fret
against God when we are in affliction, and in our distress thus to
trespass yet more. If we die, if we perish, it is owing to ourselves,
and the blame will lie upon our own heads. Or, 2. Of a repenting people.
Many interpreters take it as expressing their submission: "Now we see
that it is the will of God we should keep our distance, and that it is
at our peril if we draw nearer than is appointed. We submit to the
divine will in this appointment; we will not contend any more, lest we
all perish:" and they engage Moses to intercede for them, that they may
not be all consumed with dying. Thus the point was gained, and in this
matter God quite took away their murmurings, and henceforward they
acquiesced. Note, When God judges he will overcome, and, one way or
other, will oblige the most obstinate gainsayers to confess their folly
sooner or later, and that wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.
Vicisti Galilaee - O Galilaean, thou hast conquered!
