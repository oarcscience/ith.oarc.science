### [1 Chronicles Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 26:0</span></span>

We have here an account of the business of the Levites. That tribe had
made but a very small figure all the time of the judges, till Eli and
Samuel appeared. But when David revived religion the Levites were, of
all men, in the greatest reputation. And happy it was that they had
Levites who were men of sense, fit to support the honour of their tribe.
We have here an account, I. Of the Levites that were appointed to be
porters (v. 1-19). II. Of those that were appointed to be treasurers and
storekeepers ([Ch1 26:20-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#020).md). III. Of
those that were officers and judges in the country, and were entrusted
with the administration of public affairs ([Ch1
26:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#029).md).

[1 Chronicles 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 26:1</span></span>

Observe, I. There were porters appointed to attend the temple, who
guarded all the avenues that let to it, opened and shut all the outer
gates and attended at them, not only for the state, but for service, to
direct and instruct those who were going to worship in the courts of the
sanctuary in the decorum they were to observe, to encourage those that
were timorous, to send back the strangers and unclean, and to guard
against thieves and others that were enemies to the house of God. In
allusion to this office, ministers are said to have the keys to the
kingdom of heaven committed to them ([Mat
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019).md), that they may admit, and
exclude, according to the law of Christ.

II\. Of several of those that were called to this service, it is taken
notice of that they were mighty men of valour ([Ch1
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#006).md), strong men ([Ch1
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#007).md), able men ([Ch1
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#008).md), and one of them that he was a
wise counsellor ([Ch1 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#014).md), who
probably, when he had used this office of a deacon well and given proofs
of more than ordinary wisdom, purchased to himself a good degree, and
was preferred from the gate to the council-board, [Ti1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#013.md). As for those that excelled in
strength of body, and courage and resolution of mind, they were thereby
qualified for the post assigned them; for whatever service God calls men
to he either finds them fit or makes them so.

III\. The sons of Obed-edom were employed in this office, sixty-two of
that family. This was he that entertained the ark with reverence and
cheerfulness; and see how he was rewarded for it. 1. He had eight sons
([Ch1 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#005).md), for God blessed him. The
increase and building up of families are owing to the divine blessing;
and a great blessing it is to a family to have many children, when like
these they are able for, and eminent in, the service of God. 2. His sons
were preferred to places of trust in the sanctuary. They had faithfully
attended the ark in their own house, and now were called to attend it in
God's house. He that is trusty in little shall be trusted with more. He
that keeps God's ordinances in his own tent is fit to have the custody
of them in God's tabernacle, [Ti1 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#004.md),
[Ti1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#005.md). I have kept thy law, says
David, and this I had because I kept thy precepts, [Psa
119:55](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#055.md), [Psa
119:56](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#056.md).

IV\. It is said of one here that though he was not the first-born his
father made him the chief ([Ch1
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#010).md), either because he was very
excellent, or because the elder son was very weak. He was made chief,
perhaps not in inheriting the estate (for that was forbidden by the law,
[Deu 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#016.md), [Deu
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#017).md), but in this service, which
required personal qualifications.

V. The porters, as the singers, had their post assigned them by lot, so
many at such a gate, and so many at such a one, that every one might
know his post and make it good, [Ch1
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#013.md). It is not said that they were
cast into twenty-four courses, as before; but here are the names of
about twenty-four ([Ch1 26:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#001).md), and
the posts assigned are twenty-four, [Ch1
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#017.md), [Ch1
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#018.md). We have therefore reason to
think they were distributed into as many companies. Happy are those who
dwell in God's house: for, as they are well fed, well taught, and well
employed, so they are well guarded. Men attended at the gates of the
temple, but angels attend at the gates of the New Jerusalem, [Rev
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#012.md).

[1 Chronicles 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 26:20</span></span>

Observe, 1. There were treasures of the house of God. A great house
cannot be well kept without stores of all manner of provisions. Much was
expended daily upon the altar - flour, wine, oil, salt, fuel, besides
the lamps; quantities of these were to be kept beforehand, besides the
sacred vestments and utensils. These were the treasures of the house of
God. And, because money answers all things, doubtless they had an
abundance of it, which was received from the people's offerings,
wherewith they bought in what they had occasion for. And perhaps much
was laid up for an exigence. These treasures typified the plenty there
is in our heavenly Father's house, enough and to spare. In Christ, the
true temple, are hid treasures of wisdom and knowledge, and unsearchable
riches. 2. There were treasures of dedicated things, dedicated mostly
out of the spoils won in battle ([Ch1
26:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#027).md), as a grateful acknowledgment
of the divine protection. Abraham gave Melchisedec the tenth of the
spoils [Heb 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#004.md). In Moses's time the
officers of the army, when they returned victorious, brought of their
spoils an oblation to the Lord, [Num
31:50](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#050.md). Of late this pious custom had
been revived; and not only Samuel and David, but Saul, and Abner, and
Joab, had dedicated of their spoils to the honour and support of the
house of God, [Ch1 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#028.md). Note, The
more God bestows upon us the more he expects from us in works of piety
and charity. Great successes call for proportionable returns. When we
look over our estates we should consider, "Here are convenient things,
rich things, it may be, and fine things; but where are the dedicated
things?" Men of war must honour God with their spoils. 3. These
treasures had treasurers, those that were over them ([Ch1
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#020.md), [Ch1
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#026).md), whose business it was to keep
them, that neither moth nor rust might corrupt them, nor thieves break
through and steal, to give out as there was occasion and to see that
they were not wasted, embezzled, or alienated to the common use; and it
is probable that they kept accounts of all that was brought in and how
it was laid out.

[1 Chronicles 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch1 26:29</span></span>

All the offices of the house of God being well provided with Levites, we
have here an account of those that were employed as officers and judges
in the outward business, which must not be neglected, no, not for the
temple itself. The magistracy is an ordinance of God for the good of the
church as truly as the ministry is. And here we are told, 1. That the
Levites were employed in the administration of justice in concurrence
with the princes and elders of the several tribes, who could not be
supposed to understand the law so well as the Levites, who made it their
business to study it. None of those Levites who were employed in the
service of the sanctuary, none of the singers or porters, were concerned
in this outward business; either one was enough to engage the whole man
or it was presumption to undertake both. 2. Their charge was both in all
business of the Lord, and in the service of the kings, [Ch1
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#030.md) and again [Ch1
26:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#032.md). They managed the affairs of the
country, as well ecclesiastical as civil, took care both of God's tithes
and the king's taxes, punished offences committed immediately against
God and his honour and those against the government and the public
peace, guarded both against idolatry and against injustice, and took
care to put the laws in execution against both. Some, it is likely,
applied themselves to the affairs of religion, others to secular
affairs; and so, between both, God and the king were well served. It is
happy with a kingdom when its civil and sacred interests are thus
interwoven and jointly minded and advanced. 3. There were more Levites
employed as judges with the two tribes and a half on the other side of
Jordan than with all the rest of the tribes; there were 2700; whereas as
the west side of Jordan there were 1700, [Ch1
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#030.md), [Ch1
26:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#032.md). Either those remote tribes were
not so well furnished as the rest with judges of their own, or because
they, lying furthest from Jerusalem and on the borders of the
neighbouring nations, were most in danger of being infected with
idolatry, and most needed the help of Levites to prevent it. The
frontiers must be well guarded. 4. This is said to be done (as were all
the foregoing settlements) in the fortieth year of the reign of David
([Ch1 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#031).md), that is, the last year
of his reign. We should be so much the more industrious to do good as we
can see the day approaching. If we live to enjoy the fruit of our
labours, grudge it not to those that shall come after us.
