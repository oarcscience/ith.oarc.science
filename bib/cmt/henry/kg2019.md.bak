### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 19:0</span></span>

Jerusalem's great distress we read of in the foregoing chapter, and left
it besieged, insulted, threatened, terrified, and just ready to be
swallowed up by the Assyrian army. But in this chapter we have an
account of its glorious deliverance, not by sword or bow, but by prayer
and prophecy, and by the hand of an angel. I. Hezekiah, in great
concern, sent to the prophet Isaiah, to desire his prayers ([Kg2
19:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#001).md) and received from him an
answer of peace ([Kg2 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#006.md), [Kg2
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#007).md). II. Sennacherib sent a letter
to Hezekiah to fright him into a surrender ([Kg2
19:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#008).md). III. Hezekiah thereupon, by
a very solemn prayer, recommended his case to God, the righteous Judge,
and begged help from him ([Kg2
19:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#014).md). IV. God, by Isaiah, sent
him a very comfortable message, assuring him of deliverance ([Kg2
19:20-34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#020).md). V. The army of the
Assyrians was all cut off by an angel and Sennacherib himself slain by
his own sons ([Kg2 19:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035).md). And so
God glorified himself and saved his people.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 19:1</span></span>

The contents of Rabshakeh's speech being brought to Hezekiah, one would
have expected (and it is likely Rabshakeh did expect) that he would call
a council of war and it would be debated whether it was best to
capitulate or no. Before the siege, he had taken counsel with his
princes and his mighty men, [Ch2 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#003.md).
But that would not do now; his greatest relief is that he has a God to
go to, and what passed between him and his God on this occasion we have
here an account of.

I. Hezekiah discovered a deep concern at the dishonour done to God by
Rabshakeh's blasphemy. When he heard it, though at second hand, he rent
his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth, [Kg2
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#001.md). Good men were wont to do so when
they heard of any reproach cast on God's name; and great men must not
think it any disparagement to them to sympathize with the injured honour
of the great God. Royal robes are not too good to be rent, nor royal
flesh too good to be clothed with sackcloth, in humiliation for
indignities done to God and for the perils and terrors of his Jerusalem.
To this God now called, and was displeased with those who were not thus
affected. [Isa 22:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#012.md), Behold joy
and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, though it was a day of
trouble and perplexity in the valley of vision ([Kg2
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#005).md), which refers to this very
event. The king was in sackcloth, but many of his subjects were in soft
clothing.

II\. He went up to the house of the Lord, according to the example of
the psalmist, who, when he was grieved at the pride and prosperity of
the wicked, went into the sanctuary of God and there understood their
end, [Psa 73:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#017.md). He went to the house
of God, to meditate and pray, and get his spirit into a sedate composed
frame, after this agitation. He was not considering what answer to
return to Rabshakeh, but refers the matter to God. "Thou shalt answer,
Lord, for me." - Herbert. In the house of the Lord he found a place both
of rest and refuge, a treasury, a magazine, a council-chamber, and all
he needed, all in God. Note, When the church's enemies are very daring
and threatening it is the wisdom and duty of the church's friends to
apply to God, appeal to him, and leave their cause with him.

III\. He sent to the prophet Isaiah, by honourable messengers, in token
of the great respect he had for him, to desire his prayers, [Kg2
19:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#002.md). Eliakim and Shebna were two of
those that had heard the words of Rabshakeh and were the better able
both to acquaint and to affect Isaiah with the case. The elders of the
priests were themselves to pray for the people in time of trouble ([Joe
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#017).md); but they must go to engage
Isaiah's prayers, because he could pray better and had a better interest
in heaven. The messengers were to go in sackcloth, because they were to
represent the king, who was so clothed.

1\. Their errand to Isaiah was, "Lift up thy prayer for the remnant that
is left, that is, for Judah, which is but a remnant now that the ten
tribes are gone - for Jerusalem, which is but a remnant now that the
defenced cities of Judah are taken." Note, (1.) It is very desirable,
and what we should be desirous of when we are in trouble, to have the
prayers of our friends for us. In begging to have them we honour God, we
honour prayer, and we honour our brethren. (2.) When we desire the
prayers of others for us we must not think we are excused from praying
for ourselves. When Hezekiah sent to Isaiah to pray for him he himself
went into the house of the Lord to offer up his own prayers. (3.) Those
who speak from God to us we should in a particular manner desire to
speak to God for us. He is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, [Gen
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#007.md). The great prophet is the great
intercessor. (4.) Those are likely to prevail with God that lift up
their prayers, that is, that lift up their hearts in prayer. (5.) When
the interests of God's church are brought very low, so that there is but
a remnant left, few friends, and those weak and at a loss, then it is
time to lift up our prayer for that remnant.

2\. Two things are urged to Isaiah, to engage his prayers for them: -
(1.) Their fears of the enemy ([Kg2
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#003).md): "He is insolent and haughty; it
is a day of rebuke and blasphemy. We are despised. God is dishonoured.
Upon this account it is a day of trouble. Never were such a king and
kingdom so trampled on and abused as we are: our soul is exceedingly
filled with the contempt of the proud, and it is a sword in our bones to
hear them reproach our confidence in God, and say, Where is now your
God? and, which is worst of all, we see not which way we can help
ourselves and get clear of the reproach. Our cause is good, our people
are faithful; but we are quite overpowered with numbers. The children
are brought to the birth; now is the time, the critical moment, when, if
ever, we must be relieved. One successful blow given to the enemy would
accomplish our wishes. But, alas! we are not able to give it: There is
not strength to bring forth. Our case is as deplorable, and calls for as
speedy help, as that of a woman in travail, that is quite spent with her
throes, so that she has not strength to bear the child. Compare with
this [Hos 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#013.md). We are ready to
perish; if thou canst do any thing, have compassion upon us and help
us." (2.) Their hopes in God. To him they look, on him they depend, to
appear for them. One word from him will turn the scale, and save the
sinking remnant. If he but reprove the words of Rabshakeh (that is,
disprove them, [Kg2 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#004).md) - if he
undertake to convince and confound the blasphemer - all will be well.
And this they trust he will do, not for their merit's sake, but for his
own honour's sake, because he has reproached the living God, by
levelling him with deaf and dumb idols. They have reason to think the
issue will be good, for they can interest God in the quarrel. [Psa
74:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#022.md), Arise O God! plead thy own
cause. "He is the Lord thy God," say they to Isaiah - "thine, whose
glory thou art concerned for, and whose favour thou art interested in.
He has heard and known the blasphemous words of Rabshakeh, and
therefore, it may be, he will hear and rebuke them. We hope he will.
Help us with thy prayers to bring the cause before him, and then we are
content to leave it with him."

IV\. God, by Isaiah, sent to Hezekiah, to assure him that he would
glorify himself in the ruin of the Assyrians. Hezekiah sent to Isaiah,
not to enquire concerning the event, as many did that sent to the
prophets (Shall I recover? or the like), but to desire his assistance in
his duty. It was this that he was solicitous about; and therefore God
let him know what the event should be, in recompence of his care to do
his duty, [Kg2 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#006.md), [Kg2
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#007.md). 1. God interested himself in the
cause: They have blasphemed me. 2. He encouraged Hezekiah, who was much
dismayed: Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard; they are but
words (though swelling and fiery words), and words are but wind. 3. He
promised to frighten the king of Assyria worse than Rabshakeh had
frightened him: "I will send a blast upon him (that pestilential breath
which killed his army), upon which terrors shall seize him and drive him
into his own country, where death shall meet him." This short
threatening from the mouth of God would do execution, when all the
impotent menaces that came from Rabshakeh's mouth would vanish into air.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 19:8</span></span>

Rabshakeh, having delivered his message and received no answer (whether
he took this silence for a consent or a slight does not appear), left
his army before Jerusalem, under the command of the other generals, and
went himself to attend the king his master for further orders. He found
him besieging Libnah, a city that had revolted from Judah, [Kg2
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#022.md). Whether he had taken Lachish or
no is not certain; some think he departed from it because he found the
taking of it impracticable, [Kg2 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#008.md).
However, he was now alarmed with the rumour that the king of the
Cushites, who bordered upon the Arabians, was coming out against him
with a great army, [Kg2 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#009.md). This
made him very desirous to gain Jerusalem with all speed. To take it by
force would cost him more time and men than he could well spare, and
therefore he renewed his attack upon Hezekiah to persuade him tamely to
surrender it. Having found him an easy man once ([Kg2
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014).md), when he said, That which thou
puttest on me I will bear, he hoped again to frighten him into a
submission, but in vain. Here,

I. Sennacherib sent a letter to Hezekiah, a railing letter, a
blaspheming letter, to persuade him to surrender Jerusalem, because it
would be to no purpose for him to think of standing it out. His letter
is to the same purport with Rabshakeh's speech; there is nothing new
offered in it. Rabshakeh had said to the people, Let not Hezekiah
deceive you, [Kg2 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#029.md). Sennacherib
writes to Hezekiah, Let not thy God deceive thee, [Kg2
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#010.md). Those that have the God of
Jacob for their help, and whose hope is in the Lord their God, need not
fear being deceived by him, as the heathen were by their gods. To
terrify Hezekiah, and drive him from his anchor, he magnifies himself
and his own achievements. See how proudly he boasts, 1. Of the lands he
had conquered ([Kg2 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#011).md): All lands,
and destroyed utterly! How are the mole-hills of his victories swelled
to mountains! So far was he from destroying all lands that at this time
the land of Cush, and Tirhakah its king, were a terror to him. What vast
hyperboles may one expect in proud men's praises of themselves! 2. Of
the gods he had conquered, [Kg2 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#012.md).
"Each vanquished nation and its gods, which were so far from being able
to deliver them that they fell with them: and shall thy God deliver
thee?" 3. Of the kings he had conquered ([Kg2
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013).md), the king of Hamath and the
king of Arpad. Whether he means the prince or the idol, he means to make
himself appear greater than either, and therefore very formidable, and
the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.

II\. Hezekiah encloses this in another letter, a praying letter, a
believing letter, and sends it to the King of kings, who judges among
the gods. Hezekiah was not so haughty as not to receive the letter,
though we may suppose the superscription did not give him his due
titles; when he had received it he was not so careless as not to read
it; when he had read it he was not in such a passion as to write an
answer to it in the same provoking language; but he immediately went up
to the temple, presented himself, and then spread the letter before the
Lord ([Kg2 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014).md), not as if God
needed to have the letter shown to him (he knew what was in it before
Hezekiah did), but hereby he signified that he acknowledged God in all
his ways, - that he desired not to aggravate the injuries his enemies
did him nor to make them appear worse than they were, but desired they
might be set in a true light, - and that he referred himself to God, and
his righteous judgment, upon the whole matter. Hereby likewise he would
affect himself in the prayer he came to the temple to make; and we have
need of all possible helps to quicken us in that duty. In the prayer
which Hezekiah prayed over this letter, 1. He adores the God whom
Sennacherib had blasphemed ([Kg2
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#015).md), calls him the God of Israel,
because Israel was his peculiar people, and the God that dwelt between
the cherubim, because there was the peculiar residence of his glory upon
earth; but he gives glory to him as the God of the whole earth, and not,
as Sennacherib fancied him to be, the God of Israel only, and confined
to the temple. "Let them say what they will, thou art sovereign Lord,
for thou art the God, the God of gods, sole Lord, even thou alone,
universal Lord of all the kingdoms of the earth, and rightful Lord, for
thou hast made heaven and earth. Being Creator of all, by an
incontestable title thou art owner and ruler of all." 2. He appeals to
God concerning the insolence and profaneness of Sennacherib ([Kg2
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#016).md): "Lord, hear; Lord, see. Here
it is under his own hand; here it is in black and white." Had Hezekiah
only been abused, he would have passed it by; but it is God, the living
God, that is reproached, the jealous God. Lord, what wilt thou do for
thy great name? 3. He owns Sennacherib's triumphs over the gods of the
heathen, but distinguishes between them and the God of Israel ([Kg2
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017.md), [Kg2
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#018).md): He has indeed cast their gods
into the fire; for they were no gods, unable to help either themselves
or their worshipers, and therefore no wonder that he has destroyed them;
and, in destroying them, though he knew it not, he really served the
justice and jealousy of the God of Israel, who has determined to
extirpate all the gods of the heathen. But those are deceived who think
they can therefore be too hard for him. He is none of the gods whom
men's hands have made, but he has himself made all things, [Psa
115:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003.md), [Psa
115:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#004.md). 4. He prays that God will now
glorify himself in the defeat of Sennacherib and the deliverance of
Jerusalem out of his hands ([Kg2
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#019).md): "Now therefore save us; for if
we be conquered, as other lands are, they will say that thou art
conquered, as the gods of those lands were: but, Lord, distinguish
thyself, by distinguishing us, and let all the world know, and be made
to confess, that thou art the Lord God, the self-existent sovereign God,
even thou only, and that all pretenders are vanity and a lie." Note, The
best pleas in prayer are those which are taken from God's honour; and
therefore the Lord's prayer begins with Hallowed be thy name, and
concludes with Thine is the glory.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 19:20</span></span>

We have here the gracious copious answer which God gave to Hezekiah's
prayer. The message which he sent him by the same hand ([Kg2
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#006.md), [Kg2
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#007).md), one would think, was an answer
sufficient to his prayer; but, that he might have strong consolation, he
was encouraged by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for
God to lie, [Heb 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018.md). In general, God
assured him that his prayer was heard, his prayer against Sennacherib,
[Kg2 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#020.md). Note, The case of those
that have the prayers of God's people against them is miserable. For, if
the oppressed cry to God against the oppressor, he will hear, [Exo
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#023.md). God hears and answers, hears
with the saving strength of his right hand, [Psa
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#006.md).

This message bespeaks two things: -

I. Confusion and shame to Sennacherib and his forces. It is here
foretold that he should be humbled and broken. The prophet elegantly
directs his speech to him, as he does, [Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md). O Assyrian! the rod of my anger.
Not that this message was sent to him, but what is here said to him he
was made to know by the event. Providence spoke it to him with a
witness; and perhaps his own heart was made to whisper this to him: for
God has more ways than one of speaking to sinners in his wrath, so as to
vex them in his sore displeasure, [Psa
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005.md). Sennacherib is here represented,

1\. As the scorn of Jerusalem, [Kg2
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#021.md). He thought himself the terror
of the daughter of Zion, that chaste and beautiful virgin, and that by
his threats he could force her to submit to him: "But, being a virgin in
her Father's house and under his protection, she defies thee, despises
thee, laughs thee to scorn. Thy impotent malice is ridiculous; he that
sits in heaven laughs at thee, and therefore so do those that abide
under his shadow." By this word God intended to silence the fears of
Hezekiah and his people. Though to an eye of sense the enemy looked
formidable, to an eye of faith he looked despicable.

2\. As an enemy to God; and that was enough to make him miserable.
Hezekiah pleaded this: "Lord, he has reproached thee," [Kg2
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#016.md). "He has," saith God, "and I
take it as against myself ([Kg2
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#022).md): Whom hast thou reproached? Is
it not the Holy One of Israel, whose honour is dear to him, and who has
power to vindicate it, which the gods of the heathen have not?" Meno me
impune lacesset - No one shall provoke me with impunity.

3\. As a proud vainglorious fool, that spoke great swelling words of
vanity, and boasted of a false gift, by his boasts, as well as by his
threats, reproaching the Lord. For, (1.) He magnified his own
achievements out of measure and quite above what really they were ([Kg2
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#023.md), [Kg2
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#024).md): Thou hast said so and so. This
was not in the letter he wrote, but God let Hezekiah know that he not
only saw what was written there, but heard what he said elsewhere,
probably in the speeches he made to his councils or armies. Note, God
takes notice of the boasts of proud men, and will call them to an
account, that he may look upon them and abuse them, [Job
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#011.md). What a mighty figure does
Sennacherib think he makes! Driving his chariots to the tops of the
highest mountains, forcing his way through woods and rivers, breaking
through all difficulties, making himself master of all he had a mind to.
Nothing could stand before him or be withheld from him; no hills too
high for him to climb, no trees too strong for him to fell, no waters
too deep for him to dry up; as if he had the power of a God, to speak
and it is done. (2.) He took to himself the glory of doing these great
things, whereas they were all the Lord's doing, [Kg2
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#025.md), [Kg2
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#026.md). Sennacherib, in his letter, had
appealed to what Hezekiah had heard ([Kg2
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#011).md): Thou hast heard what the kings
of Assyria have done; but, in answer to that, he is reminded of what God
has done for Israel of old, drying up the Red Sea, leading them through
the wilderness, planting them in Canaan. "What are all thy doings to
these? And as for the desolations thou hast made in the earth, and
particularly in Judah, thou art but the instrument in God's hand, a mere
tool: it is I that have brought it to pass. I gave thee thy power, gave
thee thy success, and made thee what thou art, raised thee up to lay
waste fenced cities and so to punish them for their wickedness, and
therefore their inhabitants were of small power." What a foolish
insolent thing was it for him to exalt himself above God, and against
God, upon that which he had done by him and under him. Sennacherib's
boasts here are expounded in [Isa
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#013.md), [Isa
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#014.md), By the strength of my hand I
have done it, and by my wisdom, etc.; and they are answered ([Kg2
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#015).md), Shall the axe boast itself
against him that heweth therewith? It is surely absurd for the fly upon
the wheel to say, What a dust do I make! or for the sword in the hand to
say, What execution I do! If God be the principal agent in all that is
done, boasting is for ever excluded.

4\. As under the check and rebuke of that God whom he blasphemed. All
his motions were, (1.) Under the divine cognizance ([Kg2
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#027).md): "I have thy abode, and what
thou dost secretly devise and design, thy going out and coming in,
marches and counter-marches, and thy rage against me and my people, the
tumult of thy passions, the tumult of thy preparations, the noise and
bluster thou makest: I know it all." That was more than Hezekiah did,
who wished for intelligence of the enemy's motions; but what need was
there for this when the eye of God was a constant spy upon him? [Ch2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#009). (2..md) Under the divine control
([Kg2 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#028).md): "I will put my hook in
thy nose, thou great Leviathan ([Job
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001.md), [Job
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#002).md), my bridle in thy jaws, thou
great Behemoth. I will restrain thee, manage thee, turn thee where I
please, send thee home like a fool as thou camest, re infecta -
disappointed of thy aim." Note, It is a great comfort to all the
church's friends that God has a hook in the nose and a bridle in the
jaws of all her enemies, can make even their wrath to serve and praise
him and then restrain the remainder of it. Here shall its proud waves be
stayed.

II\. Salvation and joy to Hezekiah and his people. This shall be a sign
to them of God's favour, and that he is reconciled to them, and his
anger is turned away ([Isa 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001).md), a
wonder in their eyes (for so a sign sometimes signifies), a token for
good, and an earnest of the further mercy God has in store for them,
that a good issue shall be put to their present distress in every
respect.

1\. Provisions were scarce and dear; and what should they do for food?
The fruits of the earth were devoured by the Assyrian army, [Isa
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#009.md), [Isa
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#010.md), etc. Why, they shall not only
dwell in the land, but verily they shall be fed. If God save them, he
will not starve them, nor let them die by famine, when they have escaped
the sword: "Eat you this year that which groweth of itself, and you
shall find enough of that. Did the Assyrians reap what you sowed? You
shall reap what you did not sow." But the next year was the sabbatical
year, when the land was to rest, and they must neither sow nor reap.
What must they do that year? Why, Jehovah-jireh - The Lord will provide.
God's blessing shall save them seed and labour, and, that year too, the
voluntary productions of the earth shall serve to maintain them, to
remind them that the earth brought forth before there was a man to till
it, [Gen 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#011.md). And then, the third
year, their husbandry should return into its former channel, and they
should sow and reap as they used to do. 2. The country was laid waste,
families were broken up and scattered, and all was in confusion; how
should it be otherwise when it was over-run by such an army? As to this,
it is promised that the remnant that has escaped of the house of Judah
(that is, of the country people) shall yet again be planted in their own
habitations, upon their own estates, shall take root there, shall
increase and grow rich, [Kg2 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#030.md).
See how their prosperity is described: it is taking root downwards, and
bearing fruit upwards, being well fixed and well provided for
themselves, and then doing good to others. Such is the prosperity of the
soul: it is taking root downwards by faith in Christ, and then being
fruitful in fruits of righteousness. 3. The city was shut up, none went
out or came in; but now the remnant in Jerusalem and Zion shall go forth
freely, and there shall be none to hinder them, or make them afraid,
[Kg2 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#031.md). Great destruction had been
made both in city and country, bit in both there was a remnant that
escaped, which typified the saved remnant of Israelites indeed (as
appears by comparing [Isa 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022.md), [Isa
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#023.md), which speaks of this very
event, with [Rom 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#027.md), [Rom
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#028).md), and they shall go forth into
the glorious liberty of the children of God. 4. The Assyrians were
advancing towards Jerusalem, and would in a little time besiege it in
form, and it was in great danger of falling into their hands. But it is
here promised that the siege they feared should be prevented, - that,
though the enemy had now (as it should seem) encamped before the city,
yet they should never come into the city, no, nor so much as shoot an
arrow into it ([Kg2 19:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#032.md), [Kg2
19:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#033).md), - that he should be forced to
retire with shame, and a thousand times to repent his undertaking. God
himself undertakes to defend the city ([Kg2
19:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#034).md), and that person, that place,
cannot but be safe, the protection of which he undertakes. 5. The honour
and truth of God are engaged for the doing of all this. These are great
things, but how will they be effected? Why, the zeal of the Lord of
hosts shall do this, [Kg2 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#031.md). He is
Lord of hosts, has all creatures at his beck, therefore he is able to do
it; he is jealous for Jerusalem with great jealousy ([Zac
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#014).md); having espoused her a chaste
virgin to himself, he will not suffer he to be abused, [Kg2
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#021.md). "You have reason to think
yourselves unworthy that such great things should be done for you; but
God's own zeal will do it." His zeal, (1.) For his own honour ([Kg2
19:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#034).md): "I will do it for my own sake,
to make myself an everlasting name." God's reasons of mercy are fetched
from within himself. (2.) For his own truth: "I will do it for my
servant David's sake; not for the sake of his merit, but the promise
made to him and the covenant made with him, those sure mercies of
David." Thus all the deliverances of the church are wrought for the sake
of Christ, the Son of David.

Sometimes it was long ere prophecies were accomplished and promises
performed; but here the word was no sooner spoken than the work was
done.

I. The army of Assyria was entirely routed. That night which immediately
followed the sending of this message to Hezekiah, when the enemy had
just set down before the city and were preparing (as we now say) to open
the trenches, that night was the main body of their army slain upon the
spot by an angel, [Kg2 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035.md). Hezekiah
had not force sufficient to sally out upon them and attack their camp,
nor would God do it by sword or bow; but he sent his angel, a destroying
angel, in the dead of the night, to make an assault upon them, which
their sentinels, though ever so wakeful, could neither discover nor
resist. It was not by the sword of a mighty man or of a mean man, that
is, not of any man at all, but of an angel, that the Assyrians army was
to fall ([Isa 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#008).md), such an angel as
slew the first-born of Egypt. Josephus says it was done by a
pestilential disease, which was instant death to them. The number slain
was very great, 185,000 men, and Rabshakeh, it is likely, among the
rest. When the besieged arose, early in the morning, behold they were
all dead corpses, scarcely a living man among them. Some think the 76th
Psalm was penned on this occasion, where we read that the stout-hearted
were spoiled and slept their sleep, their last, their long sleep, [Kg2
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#005.md). See how great, in power and
might, the holy angels are, when one angel, in one night, could make so
great a slaughter. See how weak the mightiest of men are before almighty
God: who ever hardened himself against him and prospered? The pride and
blasphemy of the king are punished by the destruction of his army. All
these lives are sacrificed to God's glory and Zion's safety. The prophet
shows that therefore God suffered this vast rendezvous to be made, that
they might be gathered as sheaves into the floor, [Mic
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#012.md), [Mic
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#013.md).

II\. The king of Assyria was hereby put into the utmost confusion.
Ashamed to see himself, after all his proud boasts, thus defeated and
disabled to pursue his conquests and secure what he had (for this, we
may suppose, was the flower of his army), and continually afraid of
falling under the like stroke himself, He departed, and went, and
returned; the manner of the expression intimates the great disorder and
distraction of mind he was in, [Kg2
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#036.md). And it was not long before God
cut him off too, by the hands of two of his own sons, [Kg2
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#037.md). 1. Those that did it were very
wicked, to kill their own father (whom they were bound to protect) and
in the act of his devotion; monstrous villany! But, 2. God was righteous
in it. Justly are the sons suffered to rebel against their father that
begat them, when he was in rebellion against the God that made him.
Those whose children are undutiful to them ought to consider whether
they have not been so to their Father in heaven. The God of Israel had
done enough to convince him that he was the only true God, whom
therefore he ought to worship; yet he persists in his idolatry, and
seeks to his false god for protection against a God of irresistible
power. Justly is his blood mingled with his sacrifices, since he will
not be convinced by such a plain and dear-bought demonstration of his
folly in worshipping idols. His sons that murdered him were suffered to
escape, and no pursuit was made after them, his subjects perhaps being
weary of the government of so proud a man and thinking themselves well
rid of him. And his sons would be looked upon as the more excusable in
what they had done if it be true (as bishop Patrick suggested) that he
was now vowing to sacrifice them to his god, so that it was for their
own preservation that they sacrificed him. His successor was another
son, Esarhaddon, who (as it should seem) did not aim, like his father,
to enlarge his conquests, but rather to improve them; for he it was that
first sent colonies of Assyrians to inhabit the country of Samaria,
though it is mentioned before ([Kg2
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024).md), as appears, [Ezr
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#002.md), where the Samaritans say it was
Esarhaddon that brought them thither.
