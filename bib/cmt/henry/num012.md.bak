### [Numbers Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 12:0</span></span>

In the foregoing chapter we had the vexation which the people gave to
Moses; in this we have his patience tried by his own relations. I.
Miriam and Aaron, his own brother and sister, affronted him ([Num
12:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#001).md). II. God called them to an
account for it ([Num 12:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#004).md). III.
Miriam was smitten with a leprosy for it ([Num
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#010).md). IV. Aaron submits, and Moses
meekly intercedes for Miriam ([Num
12:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#011).md). V. She is healed, but put
to shame for seven days ([Num
12:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#014).md). And this is recorded to
show that the best persons and families have both their follies and
their crosses.

[Numbers 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 12:1</span></span>

Here is, I. The unbecoming passion of Aaron and Miriam: they spoke
against Moses, [Num 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#001.md). If Moses,
that received so much honour from God, yet received so many slights and
affronts from men, shall any of us think such trials either strange or
hard, and be either provoked or discouraged by them? But who would have
thought that disturbance should be created to Moses, 1. From those that
were themselves serious and good; nay, that were eminent in religion,
Miriam a prophetess, Aaron the high priest, both of them
joint-commissioners with Moses for the deliverance of Israel? [Mic
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#004.md), I sent before thee Moses, Aaron,
and Miriam. 2. From those that were his nearest relations, his own
brother and sister, who shone so much by rays borrowed from him? Thus
the spouse complains ([Sol 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006).md), My
mother's children were angry with me; and quarrels among relations are
in a special manner grievous. A brother offended is harder to be won
than a strong city. Yet this helps to confirm the call of Moses, and
shows that his advancement was purely by the divine favour, and not by
any compact or collusion with his kindred, who themselves grudged his
advancement. Neither did many of our Saviour's kindred believe on him,
[Joh 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#005.md). It should seem that Miriam
began the quarrel, and Aaron, not having been employed or consulted in
the choice of the seventy elders, was for the present somewhat
disgusted, and so was the sooner drawn in to take his sister's part. It
would grieve one to see the hand of Aaron in so many trespasses, but it
shows that the law made men priests who had infirmity. Satan prevailed
first with Eve, and by her with Adam; see what need we have to take heed
of being drawn into quarrels by our relations, for we know not how great
a matter a little fire may kindle. Aaron ought to have remembered how
Moses stood his friend when God was angry with him for making the golden
calf ([Deu 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#020).md), and not to have
rendered him evil for good. Two things they quarrelled with Moses about:
- (1.) About his marriage: some think a late marriage with a Cushite or
Arabian; others because of Zipporah, whom on this occasion they called,
in scorn, an Ethiopian woman, and who, they insinuated, had too great an
influence upon Moses in the choice of these seventy elders. Perhaps
there was some private falling out between Zipporah and Miriam, which
occasioned some hot words, and one peevish reflection introduced
another, till Moses and Aaron came to be interested. (2.) About his
government; not the mismanagement of it, but the monopolizing of it
([Num 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#002).md): "Hath the Lord spoken
only by Moses? Must he alone have the choice of the persons on whom the
spirit of prophecy shall come? Hath he not spoken also by us? Might not
we have had a hand in that affair, and preferred our friends, as well as
Moses his?" They could not deny that God had spoken by Moses, but it was
plain he had sometimes spoken also by them; and that which they intended
was to make themselves equal with him, though God had so many ways
distinguished him. Note, Striving to be greatest is a sin which easily
besets disciples themselves, and it is exceedingly sinful. Even those
that are well preferred are seldom pleased if others be better
preferred. Those that excel are commonly envied.

II\. The wonderful patience of Moses under this provocation. The Lord
heard it ([Num 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#002).md), but Moses
himself took no notice of it, for ([Num
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#003).md) he was very meek. He had a great
deal of reason to resent the affront; it was ill-natured and ill-timed,
when the people were disposed to mutiny, and had lately given him a
great deal of vexation with their murmurings, which would be in danger
of breaking out again when thus headed and countenanced by Aaron and
Miriam; but he, as a deaf man, heard not. When God's honour was
concerned, as in the case of the golden calf, no man more zealous than
Moses; but, when his own honour was touched, no man more meek: as bold
as a lion in the cause of God, but as mild as a lamb in his own cause.
God's people are the meek of the earth ([Zep
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#003).md), but some are more remarkable
than others for this grace, as Moses, who was thus fitted for the work
he was called to, which required all the meekness he had and sometimes
more. And sometimes the unkindness of our friends is a greater trial of
our meekness than the malice of our enemies. Christ himself records his
own meekness ([Mat 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029.md), I am meek
and lowly in heart), and the copy of meekness which Christ has set was
without a blot, but that of Moses was not.

[Numbers 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 12:4</span></span>

Moses did not resent the injury done him, nor complain of it to God, nor
make any appeal to him; but God resented it. He hears all we say in our
passion, and is a swift witness of our hasty speeches, which is a reason
why we should resolutely bridle our tongues, that we speak not ill of
others, and why we should patiently stop our ears, and not take notice
of it, if others speak ill of us. I heard not, for thou wilt hear, [Psa
38:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#013.md). The more silent we are in
our own cause the more is God engaged to plead it. The accused innocent
needs to say little if he knows the judge himself will be his advocate.

I. The cause is called, and the parties are summoned forthwith to attend
at the door of the tabernacle, [Num
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#004.md), [Num
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#005.md). Moses had often shown himself
jealous for God's honour, and now God showed himself jealous for his
reputation; for those that honour God he will honour, nor will he ever
be behind-hand with any that appear for him. Judges of old sat in the
gate of the city to try causes, and so on this occasion the shechinah in
the cloud of glory stood at the door of the tabernacle, and Aaron and
Miriam, as delinquents, were called to the bar.

II\. Aaron and Miriam were made to know that great as they were they
must not pretend to be equal to Moses, nor set up as rivals with him, v.
6-8. Were they prophets of the Lord? Of Moses it might be truly said, He
more. 1. It was true that God put a great deal of honour upon the
prophets. However men mocked them and misused them, they were the
favourites and intimates of heaven. God made himself known to them,
either by dreams when they were asleep or by visions when they were
awake, and by them made himself known to others. And those are happy,
those are great, truly great, truly happy, to whom God makes himself
known, Now he does it not by dreams and visions, as of old, but by the
Spirit of wisdom and revelation, who makes known those things to babes
which prophets and kings desired to see and might not. Hence in the last
days, the days of the Messiah, the sons and daughters are said to
prophesy ([Joe 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028).md), because they
shall be better acquainted with the mysteries of the kingdom of grace
than even the prophets themselves were; see [Heb
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md), [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md). 2. Yet the honour put upon Moses
was far greater ([Num 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#007).md): My
servant Moses is not so, he excels them all. To recompense Moses for his
meekly and patiently bearing the affronts which Miriam and Aaron gave
him, God not only cleared him, but praised him; and took that occasion
to give him an encomium which remains upon record to his immortal
honour; and thus shall those that are reviled and persecuted for
righteousness' sake have a great reward in heaven, Christ will confess
them before his Father and the holy angels. (1.) Moses was a man of
great integrity and tried fidelity. He is faithful in all my house. This
is put first in his character, because grace excels gifts, love excels
knowledge, and sincerity in the service of God puts a greater honour
upon a man and recommends him to the divine favour more than learning,
abstruse speculations, and an ability to speak with tongues. This is
that part of Moses's character which the apostle quotes when he would
show that Christ was greater than Moses, making it out that he was so in
this chief instance of his greatness; for Moses was faithful only as a
servant, but Christ as a son, [Heb
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002.md), [Heb
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#005.md), [Heb
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006.md). God entrusted Moses to deliver
his mind in all things to Israel; Israel entrusted him to treat for them
with God; and he was faithful to both. He said and did every thing in
the management of that great affair as became an honest good man, that
aimed at nothing else but the honour of God and the welfare of Israel.
(2.) Moses was therefore honoured with clearer discoveries of God's
mind, and a more intimate communion with God, than any other prophet
whatsoever. He shall, \[1.\] Hear more from God than any other prophet,
more clearly and distinctly: With him will I speak mouth to mouth, or
face to face ([Exo 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#011).md), as a man
speaks to his friend, whom he discourses with freely and familiarly, and
without any confusion or consternation, such as sometimes other prophets
were under; as Ezekiel, and John himself, when God spoke to them. By
other prophets God sent to his people reproofs, and predictions of good
or evil, which were properly enough delivered in dark speeches, figures,
types, and parables; but by Moses he gave laws to his people, and the
institution of holy ordinances, which could by no means be delivered by
dark speeches, but must be expressed in the plainest and most
intelligible manner. \[2.\] He shall see more of God than any other
prophet: The similitude of the Lord shall behold, as he hath seen it in
Horeb, when God proclaimed his name before him. Yet he saw only the
similitude of the Lord, angels and glorified saints always behold the
face of our Father. Moses had the spirit of prophecy in a way peculiar
to himself, and which set him far above all other prophets; yet he that
is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he, much more does our
Lord Jesus infinitely excel him, [Heb
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001.md), etc.

Now let Miriam and Aaron consider who it was that they insulted: Were
you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses? Against my servant,
against Moses? so it runs in the original. "How dare you abuse any
servant of mine, especially such a servant as Moses, who is a friend, a
confidant, and steward of the house?" How durst they speak to the grief
and reproach of one whom God had so much to say in commendation of?
Might they not expect that God would resent it, and take it as an
affront to himself? Note, We have reason to be afraid of saying or doing
any thing against the servants of God; it is at our peril if we do, for
God will plead their cause, and reckon that what touches them touches
the apple of his eye. It is a dangerous thing to offend Christ's little
ones, [Mat 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#006.md). Those are
presumptuous indeed that are not afraid to speak evil of dignities, [Pe2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#010.md).

III\. God, having thus shown them their fault and folly, next shows them
his displeasure ([Num 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#009).md): The anger
of the Lord was kindled against them, of which perhaps some sensible
indications were given in the change of the colour of the cloud, or some
flashes of lightning from it. But indeed it was indication enough of his
displeasure that he departed, and would not so much as hear their
excuse, for he needed not, understanding their thoughts afar off; and
thus he would show that he was displeased. Note, The removal of God's
presence from us is the surest and saddest token of God's displeasure
against us. Woe unto us if he depart; and he never departs till we by
our sin and folly drive him from us.

[Numbers 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 12:10</span></span>

Here is, I. God's judgment upon Miriam ([Num
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#010).md): The cloud departed from off
that part of the tabernacle, in token of God's displeasure, and
presently Miriam became leprous; when God goes, evil comes; expect no
good when God departs. The leprosy was a disease often inflicted by the
immediate hand of God as the punishment of some particular sin, as on
Gehazi for lying, on Uzziah for invading the priest's office, and here
on Miriam for scolding and making mischief among relations. The plague
of the leprosy, it is likely, appeared in her face, so that it appeared
to all that saw her that she was struck with it, with the worst of it,
she was leprous as snow; not only so white, but so soft, the solid flesh
losing its consistency, as that which putrefies does. Her foul tongue
(says bishop Hall) is justly punished with a foul face, and her folly in
pretending to be a rival with Moses is made manifest to all men, for
every one sees his face to be glorious, and hers to be leprous. While
Moses needs a veil to hide his glory, Miriam needs one to hide her
shame. Note, Those distempers which any way deform us ought to be
construed as a rebuke to our pride, and improved for the cure of it, and
under such humbling providences we ought to be very humble. It is a sign
that the heart is hard indeed if the flesh be mortified, and yet the
lusts of the flesh remain unmortified. It should seem that this plague
upon Miriam was designed for an exposition of the law concerning the
leprosy (Lev. 13), for it is referred to upon the rehearsal of that law,
[Deu 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#008.md), [Deu
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#009.md). Miriam was struck with a
leprosy, but not Aaron, because she was first in the transgression, and
God would put a difference between those that mislead and those that are
misled. Aaron's office, though it saved him not from God's displeasure,
yet helped to secure him from this token of his displeasure, which would
not only have suspended him for the present from officiating, when
(there being no priests but himself and his two sons) he could ill be
spared, but it would have rendered him and his office mean, and would
have been a lasting blot upon his family. Aaron as priest was to be the
judge of the leprosy, and his performing that part of his office upon
this occasion, when he looked upon Miriam, and behold she was leprous,
was a sufficient mortification to him. He was struck through her side,
and could not pronounce her leprous without blushing and trembling,
knowing himself to be equally obnoxious. This judgment upon Miriam is
improvable by us as a warning to take heed of putting any affront upon
our Lord Jesus. If she was thus chastised for speaking against Moses,
what will become of those that sin against Christ?

II\. Aaron's submission hereupon ([Num
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#011.md), [Num
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#012).md); he humbles himself to Moses,
confesses his fault, and begs pardon. He that but just now joined with
his sister in speaking against Moses is here forced for himself and his
sister to make a penitent address to him, and in the highest degree to
magnify him (as if he had the power of God to forgive and heal) whom he
had so lately vilified. Note, Those that trample upon the saints and
servants of God will one day be glad to make court to them; at furthest,
in the other world, as the foolish virgins to the wise for a little oil,
and the rich man to Lazarus for a little water; and perhaps in this
world, as Job's friend to him for his prayers, and here Aaron to Moses.
[Rev 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#009.md). In his submission, 1. He
confesses his own and his sister's sin, [Num
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#011.md). He speaks respectfully to
Moses, of whom he had spoken slightly, calls him his lord, and now turns
the reproach upon himself, speaks as one ashamed of what he had said: We
have sinned, we have done foolishly. Those sin, and do foolishly, who
revile and speak evil of any, especially of good people or of those in
authority. Repentance is the unsaying of that which we have said amiss,
and it had better be unsaid than that we be undone by it. 2. He begs
Moses's pardon: Lay not this sin upon us. Aaron was to bring his gift to
the altar, but, knowing that his brother had something against him, he
of all men was concerned to reconcile himself to his brother, that he
might be qualified to offer his gift. Some think that this speedy
submission which God saw him ready to make was that which prevented his
being struck with a leprosy as his sister was. 3. He recommends the
deplorable condition of his sister to Moses's compassionate
consideration ([Num 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#012).md): Let her
not be as one dead, that is, "Let her not continue so separated from
conversation, defiling all she touches, and even to putrefy above ground
as one dead." He eloquently describes the misery of her case, to move
his pity.

III\. The intercession made for Miriam ([Num
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#013).md): He cried unto the Lord with a
loud voice, because the cloud, the symbol of his presence, was removed
and stood at some distance, and to express his fervency in this request,
Heal her now, O Lord, I beseech thee. By this he made it to appear that
he did heartily forgive her the injury she had one him, that he had not
accused her to God, nor called for justice against her; so far from this
that, when God in tenderness to his honour had chastised her insolence,
he was the first that moved for reversing the judgment. By this example
we are taught to pray for those that despitefully use us; and not to
take pleasure in the most righteous punishment inflicted either by God
or man on those that have been injurious to us. Jeroboam's withered hand
was restored at the special instance and request of the prophet against
whom it had been stretched out, [Kg1
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#006.md). So Miriam here was healed by the
prayer of Moses, whom she had abused, and Abimelech by the prayer of
Abraham, [Gen 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#017.md). Moses might have
stood off, and have said, "She is served well enough, let her govern her
tongue better next time;" but, not content with being able to say that
he had not prayed for the inflicting of the judgment, he prays earnestly
for the removal of it. This pattern of Moses, and that of our Saviour,
Father, forgive them, we must study to conform to.

IV\. The accommodating of this matter so as that mercy and justice might
meet together. 1. Mercy takes place so far as that Miriam shall be
healed; Moses forgives her, and God will. See [Co2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#010.md). But, 2. Justice takes place so
far as that Miriam shall be humbled ([Num
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#014).md): Let her be shut out from the
camp seven days, that she herself might be made more sensible of her
fault and penitent for it, and that her punishment might be the more
public, and all Israel might take notice of it and take warning by it
not to mutiny. If Miriam the prophetess be put under such marks of
humiliation for one hasty word spoken against Moses, what may we expect
for our murmurings? If this be done in a green tree, what shall be done
in the dry? See how people debase and diminish themselves by sin, stain
their glory, and lay their honour in the dust. When Miriam praised God,
we find her at the head of the congregation and one of the brightest
ornaments of it, [Exo 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020.md). Now that
she quarrelled with God we find her expelled as the filth and
off-scouring of it. A reason is given for her being put out of the camp
for seven days, because thus she ought to accept of the punishment of
her iniquity. If her father, her earthly father, had but spit in her
face, and so signified his displeasure against her, would she not be so
troubled and concerned at it, and so sorry that she had deserved it, as
to shut herself up for some time in her room, and not come into his
presence, or show her face in the family, being ashamed of her own folly
and unhappiness? If such reverence as this be owing to the fathers of
our flesh, when they correct us, much more ought we to humble ourselves
under the mighty hand of the Father of spirits, [Heb
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#009.md). Note, When we are under the
tokens of God's displeasure for sin, it becomes us to take shame to
ourselves, and to lie down in that shame, owning that to us belongs
confusion of face. If by our own fault and folly we expose ourselves to
the reproach and contempt of men, the just censures of the church, or
the rebukes of the divine Providence, we must confess that our Father
justly spits in our face, and be ashamed.

V. The hindrance that this gave to the people's progress: The people
journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again, [Num
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#015.md). God did not remove the cloud,
and therefore they did not remove their camp. This was intended, 1. As a
rebuke to the people, who were conscious to themselves of having sinned
after the similitude of Miriam's transgression, in speaking against
Moses: thus far therefore they shall share in her punishment, that it
shall retard their march forward towards Canaan. Many things oppose us,
but nothing hinders us in the way to heaven as sin does. 2. As a mark of
respect to Miriam. If the camp had removed during the days of her
suspension, her trouble and shame had been the greater; therefore, in
compassion to her, they shall stay till her excommunication be taken
off, and she taken in again, it is probable with the usual ceremonies of
the cleansing of lepers. Note, Those that are under censure and rebuke
for sin ought to be treated with a great deal of tenderness, and not be
over-loaded, no, not with the shame they have deserved, not counted as
enemies ([Th2 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#015).md), but forgiven and
comforted, [Co2 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#007.md). Sinners must be
cast out with grief, and penitents taken in with joy. When Miriam was
absolved and re-admitted, the people went forward into the wilderness of
Paran, which joined up to the south border of Canaan, and thither their
next remove would have been if they had not put a bar in their own way.
