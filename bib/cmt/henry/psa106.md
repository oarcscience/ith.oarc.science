### [Psalms Chapter 106](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 106:0</span></span>

We must give glory to God by making confession, not only of his goodness
but our own badness, which serve as foils to each other. Our badness
makes his goodness appear the more illustrious, as his goodness makes
our badness the more heinous and scandalous. The foregoing psalm was a
history of God's goodness to Israel; this is a history of their
rebellions and provocations, and yet it begins and ends with Hallelujah;
for even sorrow for sin must not put us out of tune for praising God.
Some think it was penned at the time of the captivity in Babylon and the
dispersion of the Jewish nation thereupon, because of that prayer in the
close ([Psa 106:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047).md). I rather think it
was penned by David at the same time with the foregoing psalm, because
we find the first verse and the last two verses in that psalm which
David delivered to Asaph, at the bringing up of the ark to the place he
had prepared for it ([Ch1 16:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#034).md),
"Gather us from among the heathen;" for we may suppose that in Saul's
time there was a great dispersion of pious Israelites, when David was
forced to wander. In this psalm we have, I. The preface to the
narrative, speaking honour to God ([Psa
106:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001.md), [Psa
106:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#002).md), comfort to the saints ([Psa
106:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#003).md), and the desire of the faithful
towards God's favour ([Psa 106:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#004.md), [Psa
106:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#005).md). II. The narrative itself of
the sins of Israel, aggravated by the great things God did for them, an
account of which is intermixed. Their provocations at the Red Sea ([Psa
106:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#006).md), lusting ([Psa
106:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#013).md), mutinying ([Psa
106:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#016).md), worshipping the golden
calf ([Psa 106:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#019).md), murmuring ([Psa
106:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#024).md), joining themselves to
Baal-peor ([Psa 106:28-31](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#028).md),
quarrelling with Moses ([Psa 106:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#032.md),
[Psa 106:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#033).md), incorporating themselves
with the nations of Canaan ([Psa
106:34-39](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#034).md). To this is added an
account how God had rebuked them for their sins, and yet saved them from
ruin ([Psa 106:40-46](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#040).md). III. The
conclusion of the psalm with prayer and praise ([Psa
106:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047.md), [Psa
106:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#048).md). It may be of use to us to
sing this psalm, that, being put in mind by it of our sins, the sins of
our land, and the sins of our fathers, we may be humbled before God and
yet not despair of mercy, which even rebellious Israel often found with
God.

[Psalms 106:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 106:1</span></span>

We are here taught,

I. To bless God ([Psa 106:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001.md), [Psa
106:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#002).md): Praise you the Lord, that is,
1. Give him thanks for his goodness, the manifestation of it to us, and
the many instances of it. He is good and his mercy endures for ever; let
us therefore own our obligations to him and make him a return of our
best affections and services. 2. Give him the glory of his greatness,
his mighty acts, proofs of his almighty power, wherein he has done great
things, and such as would be opposed. Who can utter these? Who is worthy
to do it? Who is able to do it? They are so many that they cannot be
numbered, so mysterious that they cannot be described; when we have said
the most we can of the mighty acts of the Lord, the one half is not
told; still there is more to be said; it is a subject that cannot be
exhausted. We must show forth his praise; we may show forth some of it,
but who can show forth all? Not the angels themselves. This will not
excuse us in not doing what we can, but should quicken us to do all we
can.

II\. To bless the people of God, to call and account them happy ([Psa
106:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#003).md): Those that keep judgment are
blessed, for they are fit to be employed in praising God. God's people
are those whose principles are sound - They keep judgment (they adhere
to the rules of wisdom and religion, and their practices are agreeable);
they do righteousness, are just to God and to all men, and herein they
are steady and constant; they do it at all times, in all manner of
conversation, at every turn, in every instance, and herein persevering
to the end.

III\. To bless ourselves in the favour of God, to place our happiness in
it, and to seek it, accordingly, with all seriousness, as the psalmist
here, [Psa 106:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#004.md), [Psa
106:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#005.md). 1. He has an eye to the
lovingkindness of God, as the fountain of all happiness: "Remember me, O
Lord! to give me that mercy and grace which I stand in need of, with the
favour which thou bearest to thy people." As there are a people in the
world who are in a peculiar manner God's people, so there is a peculiar
favour which God bears to that people, which all gracious souls desire
an interest in; and we need desire no more to make us happy. 2. He has
an eye to the salvation of God, the great salvation, that of the soul,
as the foundation of happiness: O visit me with thy salvation. "Afford
me (says Dr. Hammond) that pardon and that grace which I stand in need
of, and can hope for from none but thee." Let that salvation be my
portion for ever, and the pledges of it my present comfort. 3. He has an
eye to the blessedness of the righteous, as that which includes all good
([Psa 106:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#005).md): "That I may see the good
of thy chosen and be as happy as the saints are; and happier I do not
desire to be." God's people are here called his chosen, his nation, his
inheritance; for he has set them apart for himself, incorporated them
under his own government, is served by them and glorified in them. The
chosen people of God have a good which is peculiar to them, which is the
matter both of their gladness and of their glorying, which is their
pleasure, and their praise. God's people have reason to be a cheerful
people, and to boast in their God all the day long; and those who have
that gladness, that glory, need not envy any of the children of men
their pleasure or pride. The gladness of God's nation, and the glory of
his inheritance, are enough to satisfy any man; for they have
everlasting joy and glory at the end of them.

[Psalms 106:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 106:6</span></span>

Here begins a penitential confession of sin, which was in a special
manner seasonable now that the church was in distress; for thus we must
justify God in all that he brings upon us, acknowledging that therefore
he has done right, because we have done wickedly; and the remembrance of
former sins, notwithstanding which God did not cast off his people, is
an encouragement to us to hope that, though we are justly corrected for
our sins, yet we shall not be utterly abandoned.

I. God's afflicted people here own themselves guilty before God ([Psa
106:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#006).md): "We have sinned with our
fathers, that is, like our fathers, after the similitude of their
transgression. We have added to the stock of hereditary guilt, and
filled up the measure of our fathers' iniquity, to augment yet the
fierce anger of the Lord," [Num 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#014.md);
[Mat 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#032.md). And see how they lay a
load upon themselves, as becomes penitents: "We have committed iniquity,
that which is in its own nature sinful, and we have done wickedly; we
have sinned with a high hand presumptuously." Or this is a confession,
not only of their imitation of, but their interest in, their fathers'
sins: We have sinned with our fathers, for we were in their loins and we
bear their iniquity, [Lam 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#007.md).

II\. They bewail the sins of their fathers when they were first formed
into a people, which, since children often smart for, they are concerned
to sorrow for, even further than to the third and fourth generation.
Even we now ought to take occasion from the history of Israel's
rebellions to lament the depravity and perverseness of man's nature and
its unaptness to be amended by the most probable means. Observe here,

1\. The strange stupidity of Israel in the midst of the favours God
bestowed upon them ([Psa 106:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#007).md): They
understood not thy wonders in Egypt. They saw them, but they did not
rightly apprehend the meaning and design of them. Blessed are those that
have not seen, and yet have understood. They thought the plagues of
Egypt were intended for their deliverance, whereas they were intended
also for their instruction and conviction, not only to force them out of
their Egyptian slavery, but to cure them of their inclination to
Egyptian idolatry, by evidencing the sovereign power and dominion of the
God of Israel, above all gods, and his particular concern for them. We
lose the benefit of providences for want of understanding them. And, as
their understandings were dull, so their memories were treacherous;
though one would think such astonishing events should never have been
forgotten, yet they remembered them not, at least they remembered not
the multitude of God's mercies in them. Therefore God is distrusted
because his favours are not remembered.

2\. Their perverseness arising from this stupidity: They provoked him at
the sea, even at the Red Sea. The provocation was, despair of
deliverance (because the danger was great) and wishing they had been
left in Egypt still, [Exo 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#011.md), [Exo
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#012.md). Quarrelling with God's
providence, and questioning his power, goodness, and faithfulness, are
as great provocations to him as any whatsoever. The place aggravated the
crime; it was at the sea, at the Red Sea, when they had newly come out
of Egypt and the wonders God had wrought for them were fresh in their
minds; yet they reproach him, as if all that power had no mercy in it,
but he had brought them out of Egypt on purpose to kill them in the
wilderness. They never lay at God's mercy so immediately as in their
passage through the Red Sea, yet there they affront it, and provoke his
wrath.

3\. The great salvation God wrought for them notwithstanding their
provocations, [Psa 106:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#008). (1..md) He
forced a passage for them through the sea: He rebuked the Red Sea for
standing in their way and retarding their march, and it was dried up
immediately; as, in the creation, at God's rebuke the waters fled, [Psa
104:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#007.md). Nay, he not only prepared them
a way, but, by the pillar of cloud and fire, he led them into the sea,
and, by the conduct of Moses, led them through it as readily as through
the wilderness. He encouraged them to take those steps, and subdued
their fears, when those were their most dangerous and threatening
enemies. See [Isa 63:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#012). (2..md) He
interposed between them and their pursuers, and prevented them from
cutting them off, as they designed. The Israelites were all on foot, and
the Egyptians had all of them chariots and horses, with which they were
likely to overtake them quickly, but God saved them from the hand of him
that hated them, namely, Pharaoh, who never loved them, but now hated
them the more for the plagues he had suffered on their account. From the
hand of his enemy, who was just ready to seize them, God redeemed them
([Psa 106:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#010).md), interposing himself, as
it were, in the pillar of fire, between the persecuted and the
persecutors. (3.) To complete the mercy, and turn the deliverance into a
victory, the Red Sea, which was a lane to them, was a grave to the
Egyptians ([Psa 106:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#011).md): The waters
covered their enemies, so as to slay them, but not so as to conceal
their shame; for, the next tide, they were thrown up dead upon the
shore, [Exo 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#030.md). There was not one
of them left alive, to bring tidings of what had become of the rest. And
why did God do this for them? Nay, why did he not cover them, as he did
their enemies, for their unbelief and murmuring? He tells us ([Psa
106:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#008).md): it was for his name's sake.
Though they did not deserve this favour, he designed it; and their
undeservings should not alter his designs, nor break his measures, nor
make him withdraw his promise, or fail in the performance of it. He did
this for his own glory, that he might make his mighty power to be known,
not only in dividing the sea, but in doing it notwithstanding their
provocations. Moses prays ([Num 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#017.md),
[Num 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#019).md), Let the power of my Lord
be great and pardon the iniquity of this people. The power of the God of
grace in pardoning sin and sparing sinners is as much to be admired as
the power of the God of nature in dividing the waters.

4\. The good impression this made upon them for the present ([Psa
106:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#012).md): Then believed they his words,
and acknowledged that God was with them of a truth, and had, in mercy to
them, brought them out of Egypt, and not with any design to slay them in
the wilderness; then they feared the Lord and his servant Moses, [Exo
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#031.md). Then they sang his praise, in
that song of Moses penned on this great occasion, [Exo
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#001.md). See in what a gracious and
merciful way God sometimes silences the unbelief of his people, and
turns their fears into praises; and so it is written, Those that erred
in spirit shall come to understanding, and those that murmured shall
learn doctrine, [Isa 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#024.md).

[Psalms 106:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 106:13</span></span>

This is an abridgment of the history of Israel's provocations in the
wilderness, and of the wrath of God against them for those provocations:
and this abridgment is abridged by the apostle, with application to us
Christians ([Co1 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#005), etc..md); for
these things were written for our admonition, that we sin not like them,
lest we suffer like them.

I. The cause of their sin was disregard to the works and word of God,
[Psa 106:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#013.md). 1. They minded not what
he had done for them: They soon forgot his works, and lost the
impressions they had made upon them. Those that do not improve God's
mercies to them, nor endeavour in some measure to render according to
the benefit done unto them, do indeed forget them. This people soon
forgot them (God took notice of this, [Exo
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#008), They have turned aside quickly.md):
They made haste, they forgot his works (so it is in the margin), which
some make to be two separate instances of their sin. They made haste;
their expectations anticipated God's promises; they expected to be in
Canaan shortly, and because they were not they questioned whether they
should ever be there and quarrelled with all the difficulties they met
with in their way; whereas he that believeth does not make haste, [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md). And, withal, they forgot his
works, which were the undeniable evidences of his wisdom, power, and
goodness, and denied the conclusion as confidently as if they had never
seen the premises proved. This is mentioned again ([Psa
106:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#021.md), [Psa
106:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#022).md): They forgot God their
Saviour; that is, they forgot that he had been their Saviour. Those that
forget the works of God forget God himself, who makes himself known by
his works. They forgot what was done but a few days before, which we may
suppose they could not but talk of, even then, when, because they did
not make a good use of it, they are said to forget it: it was what God
did for them in Egypt, in the land of Ham, and by the Red Sea, things
which we at this distance cannot, or should not, be unmindful of. They
are called great things (for, though the great God does nothing mean,
yet he does some things that are in a special manner great), wondrous
works, out of the common road of Providence, therefore observable,
therefore memorable, and terrible things, awful to them, and dreadful to
their enemies, and yet soon forgotten. Even miracles that were seen
passed away with them as tales that are told. 2. They minded not what
God had said to them nor would they depend upon it: They waited not for
his counsel, did not attend his word, though they had Moses to be his
mouth to them; they took up resolves about which they did not consult
him and made demands without calling upon him. They would be in Canaan
directly, and had not patience to tarry God's time. The delay was
intolerable, and therefore the difficulties were looked upon as
insuperable. This is explained ([Psa
106:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#024).md): They believed not his word,
his promise that he would make them masters of Canaan; and ([Psa
106:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#025).md), They hearkened not to the
voice of the Lord, who gave them counsel which they would not wait for,
not only by Moses and Aaron, but by Caleb and Joshua, [Num
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#006.md), [Num
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#007.md), etc. Those that will not wait
for God's counsel shall justly be given up to their own hearts' lusts,
to walk in their own counsels.

II\. Many of their sins are here mentioned, together with the tokens of
God's displeasure which they fell under for those sins.

1\. They would have flesh, and yet would not believe that God could give
it to them ([Psa 106:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#014).md): They lusted
a lust (so the word is) in the wilderness; there, where they had bread
enough and to spare, yet nothing would serve them but they must have
flesh to eat. They were now purely at God's finding, being supported
entirely by miracles, so that this was a reflection upon the wisdom and
goodness of their Creator. They were also, in all probability, within a
step of Canaan, yet had not patience to stay for dainties till they came
thither. They had flocks and herds of their own, but they will not kill
them; God must give them flesh as he gave them bread, or they will never
give him credit, or their good word. They did not only wish for flesh,
but they lusted exceedingly after it. A desire, even of lawful things,
when it is inordinate and violent, becomes sinful; and therefore this is
called lusting after evil things ([Co1
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#006).md), though the quails, as God's
gift, were good things, and were so spoken of, [Psa
105:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#040.md). Yet this was not all: They
tempted God in the desert, where they had had such experience of his
goodness and power, and questioned whether he could and would gratify
them herein. See [Psa 78:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#019.md), [Psa
78:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#020.md). Now how did God show his
displeasure against them for this. We are told how ([Psa
106:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#015).md): He gave them their request,
but gave it them in anger, and with a curse, for he sent leanness into
their soul; he filled them with uneasiness of mind, and terror of
conscience, and a self-reproach, occasioned by their bodies being sick
with the surfeit, such as sometimes drunkards experience after a great
debauch. Or this is put for that great plague with which the Lord smote
them, while the flesh was yet between their teeth, as we read, [Num
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#033.md). It was the consumption of the
life. Note, (1.) What is asked in passion is often given in wrath. (2.)
Many that fare deliciously every day, and whose bodies are healthful and
fat, have, at the same time, leanness in their souls, no love to God, no
thankfulness, no appetite to the bread of life, and then the soul must
needs be lean. Those wretchedly forget themselves that feast their
bodies and starve their souls. Then God gives the good things of this
life in love, when with them he gives grace to glorify him in the use of
them; for then the soul delights itself in fatness, [Isa
55:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#002.md).

2\. They quarrelled with the government which God had set over them both
in church and state ([Psa 106:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#016).md):
They envied Moses his authority in the camp, as generalissimo of the
armies of Israel and chief justice in all their courts; they envied
Aaron his power, as saint of the Lord, consecrated to the office of high
priest, and Korah would needs put in for the pontificate, while Dathan
and Abiram, as princes of the tribe of Reuben, Jacob's eldest son, would
claim to be chief magistrates, by the so-much-admired right of
primogeniture. Note, Those are preparing ruin for themselves who envy
those whom God has put honour upon and usurp the dignities they were
never designed for. And justly will contempt be poured upon those who
put contempt upon any of the saints of the Lord. How did God show his
displeasure for this? We are told how, and it is enough to make us
tremble ([Psa 106:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#017.md), [Psa
106:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#018).md); we have the story, [Num
16:32](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#032.md), [Num
16:35](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#035). (1..md) Those that flew in the
face of the civil authority were punished by the earth, which opened and
swallowed them up, as not fit to go upon God's ground, because they
would not submit to God's government. (2.) Those that would usurp the
ecclesiastical authority in things pertaining to God suffered the
vengeance of heaven, for fire came out from the Lord and consumed them,
and the pretending sacrificers were themselves sacrificed to divine
justice. The flame burnt up the wicked; for though they vied with Aaron,
the saint of the Lord, for holiness ([Num
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#003.md), [Num
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#005).md), yet God adjudged them wicked,
and as such cut them off, as in due time he will destroy the man of sin,
that wicked one, notwithstanding his proud pretensions to holiness.

3\. They made and worshipped the golden calf, and this in Horeb, where
the law was given, and where God had expressly said, Thou shalt neither
make any graven image nor bow down to it; they did both: They made a
calf and worshipped it, [Psa 106:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#019.md).

(1.) Herein they bade defiance to, and put an affront upon, the two
great lights which God has made to rule the moral world: - \[1.\] That
of human reason; for they changed their glory, their God, at least the
manifestation of him, which always had been in a cloud (either a dark
cloud or a bright one), without any manner of visible similitude, into
the similitude of Apis, one of the Egyptian idols, an ox that eateth
grass, than which nothing could be more grossly and scandalously absurd,
[Psa 106:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#020.md). Idolaters are perfectly
besotted, and put the greatest disparagement possible both upon God, in
representing him by the image of a beast, and upon themselves, in
worshipping it when they have so done. That which is here said to be the
changing of their glory is explained by St. Paul ([Rom
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#023).md) to be the changing of the glory
of the incorruptible God. \[2.\] That of divine revelation, which was
afforded to them, not only in the words God spoke to them, but in the
works he wrought for them, wondrous works, which declared aloud that the
Lord Jehovah is the only true and living God and is alone to be
worshipped, [Psa 106:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#021.md), [Psa
106:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#022.md).

(2.) For this God showed his displeasure by declaring the decree that he
would cut them off from being a people, as they had, as far as lay in
their power, in effect cut him off from being a God; he spoke of
destroying them ([Psa 106:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#023).md), and
certainly he would have done it if Moses, his chosen, had not stood
before him in the breach ([Psa
106:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#023).md), if he had not seasonably
interposed to deal with God as an advocate about the breach or ruin God
was about to devote them to and wonderfully prevailed to turn away his
wrath. See here the mercy of God, and how easily his anger is turned
away, even from a provoking people. See the power of prayer, and the
interest which God's chosen have in heaven. See a type of Christ, God's
chosen, his elect, in whom his soul delights, who stood before him in
the breach to turn away his wrath from a provoking world, and ever
lives, for this end, making intercession.

4\. They gave credit to the report of the evil spies concerning the land
of Canaan, in contradiction to the promise of God ([Psa
106:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#024).md): They despised the pleasant
land. Canaan was a pleasant land, [Deu
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#007.md). They undervalued it when they
thought it not worth venturing for, no, not under the guidance of God
himself, and therefore were for making a captain and returning to Egypt
again. They believed not God's word concerning it, but murmured in their
tents, basely charging God with a design upon them in bringing them
thither that they might become a prey to the Canaanites, [Num
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#002.md), [Num
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#003.md). And, when they were reminded of
God's power and promise, they were so far from hearkening to that voice
of the Lord that they attempted to stone those who spoke to them, [Num
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#010.md). The heavenly Canaan is a
pleasant land. A promise is left us of entering into it; but there are
many that despise it, that neglect and refuse the offer of it, that
prefer the wealth and pleasure of this world before it, and grudge the
pains and hazards of this life to obtain that. This also was so
displeasing to God that he lifted up his hand against them, in a way of
threatening, to destroy them in the wilderness; nay, in a way of
swearing, for he swore in his wrath that they should not enter into his
rest ([Psa 95:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#011.md); [Num
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#028).md); nay, and he threatened that
their children also should be overthrown and scattered ([Psa
106:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#026.md), [Psa
106:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#027).md), and the whole nation
dispersed and disinherited; but Moses prevailed for mercy for their
seed, that they might enter Canaan. Note, Those who despise God's
favours, and particularly the pleasant land, forfeit his favours, and
will be shut out for ever from the pleasant land.

5\. They were guilty of a great sin in the matter of Peor; and this was
the sin of the new generation, when they were within a step of Canaan
([Psa 106:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#028).md): They joined themselves
to Baal-peor, and so were entangled both in idolatry and in adultery, in
corporeal and in spiritual whoredom, [Num
25:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001.md). Those that did often partake
of the altar of the living God now ate the sacrifices of the dead, of
the idols of Moab (that were dead images, or dead men canonized or
deified), or sacrifices to the infernal deities on the behalf of their
dead friends. Thus they provoked God to anger with their inventions
([Psa 106:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#029).md), in contempt of him and
his institutions, his commands, and his threatenings. The iniquity of
Peor was so great that, long after, it is said, They were not cleansed
from it, [Jos 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#017.md). God testified his
displeasure at this, (1.) By sending a plague among them, which in a
little time swept away 24,000 of those impudent sinners. (2.) By
stirring up Phinehas to use his power as a magistrate for the
suppressing of the sin and checking the contagion of it. He stood up in
his zeal for the Lord of hosts, and executed judgment upon Zimri and
Cozbi, sinners of the first rank, genteel sinners; he put the law in
execution upon them, and this was a service so pleasing to God that upon
it the plague was stayed, [Psa 106:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#030.md).
By this, and some other similar acts of public justice on that occasion
([Num 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#004.md), [Num
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#005).md), the guilt ceased to be
national, and the general controversy was let fall. When the proper
officers did their duty God left it to them, and did not any longer keep
the work in his own hands by the plague. Note, National justice prevents
national judgments. But, Phinehas herein signalizing himself, a special
mark of honour was put upon him, for what he did was counted to him for
righteousness to all generations ([Psa
106:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#031).md), and, in recompence of it, the
priesthood was entailed on his family. He shall make an atonement by
offering up the sacrifices, who had so bravely made an atonement (so
some read it, [Psa 106:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#030).md) by offering
up the sinners. Note, It is the honour of saints to be zealous against
sin.

6\. They continued their murmurings to the very last of their
wanderings; for in the fortieth year they angered God at the waters of
strife ([Psa 106:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#032).md), which refers to
that story, [Num 20:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#003.md). And that
which aggravated it now was that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;
for, though he was the meekest of all the men in the earth, yet their
clamours at that time were so peevish and provoking that they put him
into a passion, and, having now grown very old and off his guard, he
spoke unadvisedly with his lips ([Psa
106:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#033).md), and not as became him on that
occasion; for he said in a heat, Hear now, you rebels, must we fetch
water out of this rock for you? This was Moses's infirmity, and is
written for our admonition, that we may learn, when we are in the midst
of provocation, to keep our mouth as with a bridle ([Psa
39:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001).md), and to take heed to our
spirits, that they admit not resentments too much; for, when the spirit
is provoked, it is much ado, even for those that have a great deal of
wisdom and grace, not to speak unadvisedly. But it is charged upon the
people as their sin: They provoked his spirit with that with which they
angered God himself. Note, We must answer not only for our own passions,
but for the provocation which by them we give to the passions of others,
especially of those who, if not greatly provoked, would be meek and
quiet. God shows his displeasure against this sin of theirs by shutting
Moses and Aaron out of Canaan for their misconduct upon this occasion,
by which, (1.) God discovered his resentment of all such intemperate
heats, even in the dearest of his servants. If he deals thus severely
with Moses for one unadvised word, what does their sin deserve who have
spoken so many presumptuous wicked words? If this was done in the green
tree, what shall be done in the dry? (2.) God deprived them of the
blessing of Moses's guidance and government at a time when they most
needed it, so that his death was more a punishment to them than to
himself. It is just with God to remove those relations from us that are
blessings to us, when we are peevish and provoking to them and grieve
their spirits.

[Psalms 106:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">psa 106:34</span></span>

Here, I. The narrative concludes with an account of Israel's conduct in
Canaan, which was of a piece with that in the wilderness, and God's
dealings with them, wherein, as all along, both justice and mercy
appeared.

1\. They were very provoking to God. The miracles and mercies which
settled them in Canaan made no more deep and durable impressions upon
them than those which fetched them out of Egypt; for by the time they
were just settled in Canaan they corrupted themselves, and forsook God.
Observe,

(1.) The steps of their apostasy. \[1.\] They spared the nations which
God had doomed to destruction ([Psa
106:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#034).md); when they had got the good
land God had promised them they had no zeal against the wicked
inhabitants whom the Lord commanded them to extirpate, pretending pity;
but so merciful is God that no man needs to be in any case more
compassionate than he. \[2.\] When they spared them they promised
themselves that, notwithstanding this, they would not join in any
dangerous affinity with them. But the way of sin is down-hill; omissions
make way for commissions; when they neglect to destroy the heathen the
next news we hear is, They were mingled among the heathen, made leagues
with them and contracted an intimacy with them, so that they learned
their works, [Psa 106:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#035.md). That which
is rotten will sooner corrupt that which is sound than be cured or made
sound by it. \[3.\] When they mingled with them, and learned some of
their works that seemed innocent diversions and entertainments, yet they
thought they would never join with them in their worship; but by degrees
they learned that too ([Psa 106:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#036).md):
They served their idols in the same manner, and with the same rites,
that they served them; and they became a snare to them. That sin drew on
many more, and brought the judgments of God upon them, which they
themselves could not but be sensible of and yet knew not how to recover
themselves. \[4.\] When they joined with them in some of their
idolatrous services, which they thought had least harm in them, they
little thought that ever they should be guilty of that barbarous and
inhuman piece of idolatry the sacrificing of their living children to
their dead gods; but they came to that at last ([Psa
106:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#037.md), [Psa
106:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#038).md), in which Satan triumphed over
his worshippers, and regaled himself in blood and slaughter: They
sacrificed their sons and daughters, pieces of themselves, to devils,
and added murder, the most unnatural murder, to their idolatry; one
cannot think of it without horror. They shed innocent blood, the most
innocent, for it was infant-blood, nay, it was the blood of their sons
and their daughters. See the power of the spirit that works in the
children of disobedience, and see his malice. The beginning of idolatry
and superstition, like that of strife, is as the letting forth of water,
and there is no villany which those that venture upon it can be sure
they shall stop short of, for God justly gives them up to a reprobate
mind, [Rom 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md).

(2.) Their sin was, in part, their own punishment; for by it, \[1.\]
They wronged their country: The land was polluted with blood, [Psa
106:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#038.md). That pleasant land, that holy
land, was rendered uncomfortable to themselves, and unfit to receive
those kind tokens of God's favour and presence in it which were designed
to be its honour. \[2.\] They wronged their consciences ([Psa
106:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#039).md): They went a whoring with
their own inventions, and so debauched their own minds, and were defiled
with their own works, and rendered odious in the eyes of the holy God,
and perhaps of their own consciences.

2\. God brought his judgments upon them; and what else could be
expected? For his name is Jealous, and he is a jealous God. (1.) He fell
out with them for it, [Psa 106:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#040.md). He
was angry with them: The wrath of God, that consuming fire, was kindled
against his people; for from them he took it as more insulting and
ungrateful than from the heathen that never knew him. Nay, he was sick
of them: He abhorred his own inheritance, which once he had taken
pleasure in; yet the change was not in him, but in them. This is the
worst thing in sin, that it makes us loathsome to God; and the nearer
any are to God in profession the more loathsome are they if they rebel
against him, like a dunghill at our door. (2.) Their enemies then fell
upon them, and, their defence having departed, made an easy prey of them
([Psa 106:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#041.md), [Psa
106:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#042).md): He gave them into the hands
of the heathen. Observe here how the punishment answered to the sin:
They mingled with the heathen and learned their works; from them they
willingly took the infection of sin, and therefore God justly made use
of them as the instruments of their correction. Sinners often see
themselves ruined by those by whom they have suffered themselves to be
debauched. Satan, who is a tempter, will be a tormentor. The heathen
hated them. Apostates lose all the love on God's side, and get none on
Satan's; and when those that hated them ruled over them, and they were
brought into subjection under them, no marvel that they oppressed them
and ruled them with rigour; and thus God made them know the difference
between his service and the service of the kings of the countries, [Ch2
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#008). (3..md) When God granted them some
relief, yet they went on in their sins, and their troubles also were
continued, [Psa 106:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#043.md). This refers to
the days of the Judges, when God often raised up deliverers and wrought
deliverances for them, and yet they relapsed to idolatry and provoked
God with their counsel, their idolatrous inventions, to deliver them up
to some other oppressor, so that at last they were brought very low for
their iniquity. Those that by sin disparage themselves, and will not by
repentance humble themselves, are justly debased, and humbled, and
brought low, by the judgments of God. (4.) At length they cried unto
God, and God returned in favour to them, [Psa
106:44-46](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#044.md). They were chastened for
their sins, but not destroyed, cast down, but not cast off. God appeared
for them, \[1.\] As a God of mercy, who looked upon their grievances,
regarded their affliction, beheld when distress was upon them (so some),
who looked over their complaints, for he heard their cry with tender
compassion ([Exo 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#007).md) and overlooked
their provocations; for though he had said, and had reason to say it,
that he would destroy them, yet he repented, according to the multitude
of his mercies, and reversed the sentence. Though he is not a man that
he should repent, so as to change his mind, yet he is a gracious God,
who pities us, and changes his way. \[2.\] As a God of truth, who
remembered for them his covenant, and made good every word that he had
spoken; and therefore, bad as they were, he would not break with them,
because he would not break his own promise. \[3.\] As a God of power,
who has all hearts in his hand, and turns them which way soever he
pleases. He made them to be pitied even of those that carried them
captives, and hated them, and ruled them with rigour. He not only
restrained the remainder of their enemies' wrath, that it should not
utterly consume them, but he infused compassion even into their stony
hearts, and made them relent, which was more than any art of man could
have done with the utmost force of rhetoric. Note, God can change lions
into lambs, and, when a man's ways please the Lord, will make even his
enemies to pity him and be at peace with him. When God pities men shall.
Tranquillus Deus tranquillat omnia - A God at peace with us makes every
thing at peace.

II\. The psalm concludes with prayer and praise. 1. Prayer for the
completing of his people's deliverance. Even when the Lord brought back
the captivity of his people still there was occasion to pray, Lord, turn
again our captivity ([Psa 126:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001.md), [Psa
126:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#004).md); so here ([Psa
106:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047).md), Save us, O Lord our God! and
gather us from among the heathen. We may suppose that many who were
forced into foreign countries, in the times of the Judges (as Naomi was,
[Rut 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001).md), had not returned in the
beginning of David's reign, Saul's time being discouraging, and
therefore it was seasonable to pray, Lord, gather the dispersed
Israelites from among the heathen, to give thanks to thy holy name, not
only that they may have cause to give thanks and hearts to give thanks,
that they may have opportunity to do it in the courts of the Lord's
house, from which they were now banished, and so may triumph in thy
praise, over those that had in scorn challenged them to sing the Lord's
song in a strange land. 2. Praise for the beginning and progress of it
([Psa 106:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#048).md): Blessed be the Lord God
of Israel from everlasting to everlasting. He is a blessed God from
eternity, and will be so to eternity, and so let him be praised by all
his worshippers. Let the priests say this, and then let all the people
say, Amen, Hallelujah, in token of their cheerful concurrence in all
these prayers, praises, and confessions. According to this rubric, or
directory, we find that when this psalm (or at least the closing verses
of it) was sung all the people said Amen, and praised the Lord by
saying, Hallelujah. By these two comprehensive words it is very proper,
in religious assemblies, to testify their joining with their ministers
in the prayers and praises which, as their mouth, they offer up to God,
according to his will, saying Amen to the prayers and Hallelujah to the
praises.
