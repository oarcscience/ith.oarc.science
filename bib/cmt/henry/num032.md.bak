### [Numbers Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 32:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have, I. The humble request of the tribes of Reuben
and Gad for an inheritance on that side Jordan where Israel now lay
encamped ([Num 32:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001).md). II. Moses's
misinterpretation of their request ([Num
32:6-15](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#006).md). III. Their explication of
it, and stating it aright ([Num
32:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#016).md). IV. The grant of their
petition under the provisos and limitations which they themselves
proposed ([Num 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#020), etc..md).

[Numbers 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 32:1</span></span>

Israel's tents were now pitched in the plains of Moab, where they
continued many months, looking back upon the conquests they had already
made of the land of Sihon and Og, and looking forward to Canaan, which
they hoped in a little while to make themselves masters of. While they
made this stand, and were at a pause, this great affair of the disposal
of the conquests they had already made was here concerted and settled,
not by any particular order or appointment of God, but at the special
instance and request of two of the tribes, to which Moses, after a long
debate that arose upon it, consented. For even then, when so much was
done by the extraordinary appearances of divine Providence, many things
were left to the direction of human prudence; for God, in governing both
the world and the church, makes use of the reason of men, and serves his
own purposes by it.

I. Here is a motion made by the Reubenites and the Gadites, that the
land which they had lately possessed themselves of, and which in the
right of conquest belonged to Israel in common, might be assigned to
them in particular for their inheritance: upon the general idea they had
of the land of promise, they supposed this would be about their
proportion. Reuben and Gad were encamped under the same standard, and so
had the better opportunity of comparing notes, and settling this matter
between themselves. In the first verse the children of Reuben are named
first, but afterwards the children of Gad ([Num
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#002.md), [Num
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#025.md), [Num
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#031).md), either because the Gadites
made the first motion and were most forward for it, or because they were
the better spokesmen and had more of the art of management, Reuben's
tribe still lying under Jacob's sentence, he shall not excel. Two things
common in the world induced these tribes to make this choice and this
motion upon it, the lust of the eye and the pride of life, [Jo1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#016.md). 1. The lust of the eye. This
land which they coveted was not only beautiful for situation, and
pleasant to the eye, but it was good for food, food for cattle; and they
had a great multitude of cattle, above the rest of the tribes, it is
supposed because they brought more out of Egypt, than the rest did; but
that was forty years before, and stocks of cattle increase and decrease
in less time than that; therefore I rather think they had been better
husbands of their cattle in the wilderness, had tended them better, had
taken more care of the breed, and not been so profuse as their
neighbours in eating the lambs out of the flock and the calves out of
the midst of the stall. Now they, having these large stocks, coveted
land proportionable. Many scriptures speak of Bashan and Gilead as
places famous for cattle; they had been so already, and therefore these
tribes hoped they would be so to them, and whatever comes of it here
they desire to take their lot. The judicious Calvin thinks there was
much amiss in the principle they went upon, and that they consulted
their own private convenience more than the public good, that they had
not such regard to the honour and interest of Israel, and the promise
made to Abraham of the land of Canaan (strictly so called), as they
ought to have had. And still it is too true that many seek their own
things more than the things of Jesus Christ ([Phi
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#021).md), and that many are influenced by
their secular interest and advantage to take up short of the heavenly
Canaan. Their spirits agree too well with this world, and with the
things that are seen, that are temporal; and they say, "It is good to be
here," and so lose what is hereafter for want of seeking it. Lot thus
chose by the sight of the eye, and smarted for his choice. Would we
choose our portion aright we must look above the things that are seen.
2. Perhaps there was something of the pride of life in it. Reuben was
the first-born of Israel, but he had lost his birthright. Several of the
tribes, and Judah especially, had risen above him, so that he could not
expect the best lot in Canaan; and therefore, to save the shadow of a
birthright, when he had forfeited the substance, he here catches at the
first lot, though it was out of Canaan, and far off from the tabernacle.
Thus Esau sold his birthright, and yet got to be served first with an
inheritance in Mount Seir. The tribe of Gad descended from the
first-born of Zilpah, and were like pretenders with the Reubenites; and
Manasseh too was a first-born, but knew he must be eclipsed by Ephraim
his younger brother, and therefore he also coveted to get precedency.

II\. Moses's dislike of this motion, and the severe rebuke he gives to
it, as a faithful prince and prophet.

1\. It must be confessed that prima facie - at first sight, the thing
looked ill, especially the closing words of their petition: Bring us not
over Jordan, [Num 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#005) (1..md) It seems
to proceed from a bad principle, a contempt of the land of promise,
which Moses himself was so desirous of a sight of, a distrust too of the
power of God to dispossess the Canaanites, as if a lot in a land which
they knew, and which was already conquered, was more desirable than a
lot in a land they knew not, and which was yet to be conquered: one bird
in the hand is worth two in the bush. There seemed also to be
covetousness in it; for that which they insisted on was that it was
convenient for their cattle. It argued likewise a neglect of their
brethren, as if they cared not what became of Israel, while they
themselves were well provided for. (2.) It might have been of bad
consequence. The people might have taken improper hints from it, and
have suggested that they were few enough, when they had their whole
number, to deal with the Canaanites, but how unequal would the match be
if they should drop two tribes and a half (above a fifth part of their
strength) on this side Jordan. It would likewise be a bad precedent; if
they must have the land thus granted them as soon as it was conquered,
other tribes might make the same pretensions and claims, and so the
regular disposition of the land by lot would be anticipated.

2\. Moses is therefore very warm upon them, which is to be imputed to
his pious zeal against sin, and not to any peevishness, the effect of
old age, for his meekness abated not, any more than his natural force.
(1.) He shows them what he apprehended to be evil in this motion, that
it would discharge the heart of their brethren, [Num
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#006.md), [Num
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#007.md). "What!" (says he, with a holy
indignation at their selfishness) "shall your brethren go to war, and
expose themselves to all the hardships and hazards of the field, and
shall you sit here at your ease? No, do not deceive yourselves, you
shall never be indulged by me in this sloth and cowardice." It ill
becomes any of God's Israel to sit down unconcerned in the difficult and
perilous concernments of their brethren, whether public or personal.
(2.) He reminds them of the fatal consequences of the unbelief and
faint-heartedness of their fathers, when they were just ready to enter
Canaan, as they themselves now were. He recites the story very
particularly ([Num 32:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#008).md): "Thus did
your fathers, whose punishment should be a warning to you to take heed
of sinning after the similitude of their transgression." (3.) He gives
them fair warning of the mischief that would be likely to follow upon
this separation which they were about to make from the camp of Israel;
they would be in danger of bringing wrath upon the whole congregation,
and hurrying them all back again into the wilderness ([Num
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#014.md), [Num
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#015).md): "You have risen up in your
fathers' stead to despise the pleasant land and reject it as they did,
when we hoped you had risen up in their stead to possess it." It was an
encouragement to Moses to see what an increase of men there was in these
tribes, but a discouragement to see that it was withal an increase of
sinful men, treading in the steps of their fathers' impiety. It is sad
to see the rising generation in families and countries not only no
better, but worse than that which went before it; and what comes of it?
Why, it augments the fierce anger of the Lord; not only continues that
fire, but increases it, and fills the measure, often till it overflows
in a deluge of desolation. Note, If men did but consider as they ought,
what would be the end of sin, they would be afraid of the beginnings of
it.

[Numbers 32:16](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 32:16</span></span>

We have here the accommodating of the matter between Moses and the two
tribes, about their settlement on this side Jordan. Probably the
petitioners withdrew, and considered with themselves what answer they
should return to the severe reproof Moses had given them; and, after
some consultation, they return with this proposal, that their men of war
should go and assist their brethren in the conquest of Canaan, and they
would leave their families and flocks behind them in this land: and thus
they might have their request, and no harm would be done. Now it is
uncertain whether they designed this at first when they brought their
petition or no. If they did, it is an instance how often that which is
honestly meant is unhappily misinterpreted; yet Moses herein was
excusable, for he had reason to suspect the worst of them, and the
rebuke he gave them was from the abundance of his care to prevent sin.
But, if they did not, it is an instance of the good effect of plain
dealing; Moses, by showing them their sin, and the danger of it, brought
them to their duty without murmuring or disputing. They object not that
their brethren were able to contend with the Canaanites without their
help, especially since they were sure of God's fighting for them; but
engage themselves to stand by them.

I. Their proposal is very fair and generous, and such as, instead of
disheartening, would rather encourage their brethren. 1. That their men
of war, who were fit for service, would go ready armed before the
children of Israel into the land of Canaan. So far would they be from
deserting them that, if it were thought fit, they would lead them on,
and be foremost is all dangerous enterprises. So far were they from
either distrusting or despising the conquest of Canaan that they would
assist in it with the utmost readiness and resolution. 2. That they
would leave behind them their families and cattle (which would otherwise
be but the incumbrance of their camp), and so they would be the more
serviceable to their brethren, [Num
32:16](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#016.md). 3. That they would not return
to their possessions till the conquest of Canaan was completed, [Num
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#018.md). Their brethren should have
their best help as long as they needed it. 4. That yet they would not
expect any share of the land that was yet to be conquered ([Num
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#019).md): "We will not desire to inherit
with them, nor, under colour of assisting them in the war, put in for a
share with them in the land; no, we will be content with our inheritance
on this side Jordan, and there will be so much the more on yonder side
for them."

II\. Moses thereupon grants their request, upon consideration that they
would adhere to their proposals. 1. He insists much upon it that they
should never lay down their arms till their brethren laid down theirs.
They promised to go armed before the children of Israel, [Num
32:17](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#017.md). "Nay," says Moses, "you shall
go armed before the Lord, [Num 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#020.md),
[Num 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#021.md). It is God's cause more
than your brethren's, and to him you must have an eye, and not to them
only." Before the Lord, that is, before the ark of the Lord, the token
of his presence, which, it should seem, they carried about with them in
the wars of Canaan, and immediately before which these two tribes were
posted, as we find in the order of their march, [Num
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#010.md), [Num
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#017.md). 2. Upon this condition he grants
them this land for their possession, and tells them they shall be
guiltless before the Lord and before Israel, [Num
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#022.md). They should have the land, and
neither sin nor blame should cleave to it, neither sin before God nor
blame before Israel; and, whatever possessions we have, it is desirable
thus to come guiltless to them. But, 3. He warns them of the danger of
breaking their word: "If you fail, you sin against the Lord ([Num
32:23](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#023).md), and not against your brethren
only, and be sure your sin will find you out;" that is, "God will
certainly reckon with you for it, though you may make a light matter of
it." Note, Sin will, without doubt, find out the sinner sooner or later.
It concerns us therefore to find our sins out, that we may repent of
them and forsake them, lest our sins find us out to our ruin and
confusion.

III\. They unanimously agree to the provisos and conditions of the
grant, and do, as it were, give bond for performance, by a solemn
promise: Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth, [Num
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#025.md). Their brethren had all
contributed their assistance to the conquest of this country, which they
desired for a possession, and therefore they owned themselves obliged in
justice to help them in the conquest of that which was to be their
possession. Having received kindness, we ought to return it, though it
was not so conditioned when we received it. We may suppose that this
promise was understood, on both sides, so as not to oblige all that were
numbered of these tribes to go over armed, but those only that were
fittest for the expedition, who would be most serviceable, while it was
necessary that some should be left to till the ground and guard the
country; and accordingly we find that about 40,000 of the two tribes and
a half went over armed ([Jos 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#013).md),
whereas their whole number was about 100,000.

[Numbers 32:28](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">num 32:28</span></span>

Here, 1. Moses settles this matter with Eleazar, and with Joshua who was
to be his successor, knowing that he himself must not live to see it
perfected, [Num 32:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#028.md). He gives
them an estate upon condition, leaving it to Joshua, if they fulfilled
the condition, to declare the estate absolute: "If they will not go over
with you," he does not say "you shall give them no inheritance at all,"
but "you shall not give them this inheritance which they covet. if their
militia will not come over with you, compel the whole tribes to come
over, and let them take their lot with their brethren, and fare as they
fare; they shall have possessions in Canaan, and let them not expect
that the lot will favour them." Hereupon they repeat their promise to
adhere to their brethren, v. 31, 32. 2. Moses settles them in the land
they desired. He gave it to them for a possession, v. 33. Here is the
first mention of the half tribe of Manasseh coming in with them for a
share; probably they had not joined with them in the petition, but, the
land when it came to be apportioned proving to be too much for them,
this half tribe had a lot among them, perhaps at their request, or by
divine direction, or because they had signalized themselves in the
conquest of this country: for the children of Machir, a stout and
warlike family, had taken Gilead and dispossessed the Amorites, v. 39.
"Let them win it and wear it, get it and take it." And, they being
celebrated for their courage and bravery, it was for the common safety
to put them in this frontier-country. Concerning the settlement of these
tribes observe, (1.) They built the cities, that is, repaired them,
because either they had been damaged by the war or the Amorites had
suffered them to go to decay. (2.) They changed the names of them (v.
38), either to show their authority, that the change of the names might
signify the change of their owners, or because their names were
idolatrous, and carried in them a respect to the dunghill-deities that
were there worshipped. Nebo and Baal were names of their gods, which
they were forbidden to make mention of ([Exo
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#013).md), and which, by changing the
names of these cities, they endeavoured to bury in oblivion; and God
promises to take away the names of Baalim out of the mouths of his
people, [Hos 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#017.md).

Lastly, It is observable that, as these tribes were now first placed
before the other tribes, so, long afterwards, they were displaced before
the other tribes. We find that they were carried captive into Assyria
some years before the other tribes, [Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md). Such a proportion does
Providence sometimes observe in balancing prosperity and adversity; he
sets the one over-against the other.
