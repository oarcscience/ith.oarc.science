### [Job Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 27:0</span></span>

Job had sometimes complained of his friends that they were so eager in
disputing that they would scarcely let him put in a word: "Suffer me
that I may speak;" and, "O that you would hold your peace!" But now, it
seems, they were out of breath, and left him room to say what he would.
Either they were themselves convinced that Job was in the right or they
despaired of convincing him that he was in the wrong; and therefore they
threw away their weapons and gave up the cause. Job was too hard for
them, and forced them to quit the field; for great is the truth and will
prevail. What Job had said ([Job
26:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#001).md) was a sufficient answer to
Bildad's discourse; and now Job paused awhile, to see whether Zophar
would take his turn again; but, he declining it, Job himself went on,
and, without any interruption or vexation given him, said all he desired
to say in this matter. I. He begins with a solemn protestation of his
integrity and of his resolution to hold it fast ([Job
27:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#002).md). II. He expresses the dread he
had of that hypocrisy which they charged him with ([Job
27:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#007).md). III. He shows the miserable
end of wicked people, notwithstanding their long prosperity, and the
curse that attends them and is entailed upon their families ([Job
27:11-23](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#011).md).

[Job 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 27:1</span></span>

Job's discourse here is called a parable (mashal), the title of
Solomon's proverbs, because it was grave and weighty, and very
instructive, and he spoke as one having authority. It comes from a word
that signifies to rule, or have dominion; and some think it intimates
that Job now triumphed over his opponents, and spoke as one that had
baffled them. We say of an excellent preacher that he knows how dominari
in concionibus - to command his hearers. Job did so here. A long strife
there had been between Job and his friends; they seemed disposed to have
the matter compromised; and therefore, since an oath for confirmation is
an end of strife ([Heb 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#016).md), Job here
backs all he had said in maintenance of his own integrity with a solemn
oath, to silence contradiction, and take the blame entirely upon himself
if he prevaricated. Observe,

I. The form of his oath ([Job 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#002).md):
As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment. Here, 1. He speaks
highly of God, in calling him the living God (which means everliving,
the eternal God, that has life in himself) and in appealing to him as
the sole and sovereign Judge. We can swear by no greater, and it is an
affront to him to swear by any other. 2. Yet he speaks hardly of him,
and unbecomingly, in saying that he had taken away his judgment (that
is, refused to do him justice in this controversy and to appear in
defence of him), and that by continuing his troubles, on which his
friends grounded their censures of him, he had taken from him the
opportunity he hoped ere now to have of clearing himself. Elihu reproved
him for this word ([Job 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#005).md); for God
is righteous in all his ways, and takes away no man's judgment. But see
how apt we are to despair of favour if it be not shown us immediately,
so poor-spirited are we and so soon weary of waiting God's time. He also
charges it upon God that he had vexed his soul, had not only not
appeared for him, but had appeared against him, and, by laying such
grievous afflictions upon him had quite embittered his life to him and
all the comforts of it. We, by our impatience, vex our own souls and
then complain of God that he has vexed them. Yet see Job's confidence in
the goodness both of his cause and of his God, that though God seemed to
be angry with him, and to act against him for the present, yet he could
cheerfully commit his cause to him.

II\. The matter of his oath, [Job
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#003.md), [Job
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#004.md). 1. That he would not speak
wickedness, nor utter deceit - that, in general, he would never allow
himself in the way of lying, that, as in this debate he had all along
spoken as he thought, so he would never wrong his conscience by speaking
otherwise; he would never maintain any doctrine, nor assert any matter
of fact, but what he believed to be true; nor would he deny the truth,
how much soever it might make against him: and, whereas his friends
charged him with being a hypocrite, he was ready to answer, upon oath,
to all their interrogatories, if called to do so. On the one hand he
would not, for all the world, deny the charge if he knew himself guilty,
but would declare the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
and take to himself the shame of his hypocrisy. On the other hand, since
he was conscious to himself of his integrity, and that he was not such a
man as his friends represented him, he would never betray his integrity,
nor charge himself with that which he was innocent of. He would not be
brought, no, not by the rack of their unjust censures, falsely to accuse
himself. If we must not bear false witness against our neighbour, then
not against ourselves. 2. That he would adhere to this resolution as
long as he lived ([Job 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#003).md): All the
while my breath is in me. Our resolutions against sin should be thus
constant, resolutions for life. In things doubtful and indifferent, it
is not safe to be thus peremptory. We know not what reason we may see to
change our mind: God may reveal to us that which we now are not aware
of. But in so plain a thing as this we cannot be too positive that we
will never speak wickedness. Something of a reason for his resolution is
here implied - that our breath will not be always in us. We must shortly
breathe our last, and therefore, while our breath is in us, we must
never breathe wickedness and deceit, nor allow ourselves to say or do
any thing which will make against us when our breath shall depart. The
breath in us is called the spirit of God, because he breathed it into
us; and this is another reason why we must not speak wickedness. It is
God that gives us life and breath, and therefore, while we have breath,
we must praise him.

III\. The explication of his oath ([Job
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#005.md), [Job
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#006).md): "God forbid that I should
justify you in your uncharitable censures of me, by owning myself a
hypocrite: no, until I die I will not remove my integrity from me; my
righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go." 1. He would always
be an honest man, would hold fast his integrity, and not curse God, as
Satan, by his wife, urged him to do, [Job
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#009.md). Job here thinks of dying, and of
getting ready for death, and therefore resolves never to part with his
religion, though he had lost all he had in the world. Note, The best
preparative for death is perseverance to death in our integrity. "Until
I die," that is, "though I die by this affliction, I will not thereby be
put out of conceit with my God and my religion. Though he slay me, yet
will I trust in him." 2. He would always stand to it that he was an
honest man; he would not remove, he would not part with, the conscience,
and comfort, and credit of his integrity; he was resolved to defend it
to the last. "God knows, and my own heart knows, that I always meant
well, and did not allow myself in the omission of any known duty or the
commission of any known sin. This is my rejoicing, and no man shall rob
me of it; I will never lie against my right." It has often been the lot
of upright men to be censured and condemned as hypocrites; but it well
becomes them to bear up boldly against such censures, and not to be
discouraged by them nor think the worse of themselves for them; as the
apostle ([Heb 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#018).md): We have a good
conscience in all things, willing to live honestly.

Hic murus aheneus esto, nil conscire sibi.

Be this thy brazen bulwark of defence,

Still to preserve thy conscious innocence.

Job complained much of the reproaches of his friends; but (says he) my
heart shall not reproach me, that is, "I will never give my heart cause
to reproach me, but will keep a conscience void of offence; and, while I
do so, I will not give my heart leave to reproach me." Who shall lay any
thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies. To resolve
that our hearts shall not reproach us when we give them cause to do so
is to affront God, whose deputy conscience is, and to wrong ourselves;
for it is a good thing, when a man has sinned, to have a heart within
him to smite him for it, [Sa2 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#010.md).
But to resolve that our hearts shall not reproach us while we still hold
fast our integrity is to baffle the designs of the evil spirit (who
tempts good Christians to question their adoption, If thou be the Son of
God) and to concur with the operations of the good Spirit, who witnesses
to their adoption.

[Job 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 27:7</span></span>

Job having solemnly protested the satisfaction he had in his integrity,
for the further clearing of himself, here expresses the dread he had of
being found a hypocrite.

I. He tells us how he startled at the thought of it, for he looked upon
the condition of a hypocrite and a wicked man to be certainly the most
miserable condition that any man could be in ([Job
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#007).md): Let my enemy be as the wicked,
a proverbial expression, like that ([Dan
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#019).md), The dream be to those that hate
thee. Job was so far from indulging himself in any wicked way, and
flattering himself in it, that, if he might have leave to wish the
greatest evil he could think of to the worst enemy he had in the world,
he would wish him the portion of a wicked man, knowing that worse he
could not wish him. Not that we may lawfully wish any man to be wicked,
or that any man who is not wicked should be treated as wicked; but we
should all choose to be in the condition of a beggar, an out-law, a
galley-slave, any thing, rather that in the condition of the wicked,
though in ever so much pomp and outward prosperity.

II\. He gives us the reasons of it.

1\. Because the hypocrite's hopes will not be crowned ([Job
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#008).md): For what is the hope of the
hypocrite? Bildad had condemned it ([Job
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#013.md), [Job
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#014).md), and Zophar ([Job
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#020).md), and Job here concurs with
them, and reads the death of the hypocrite's hope with as much assurance
as they had done; and this fitly comes in as a reason why he would not
remove his integrity, but still hold it fast. Note, The consideration of
the miserable condition of wicked people, and especially hypocrites,
should engage us to be upright (for we are undone, for ever undone, if
we be not) and also to get the comfortable evidence of our uprightness;
for how can we be easy if the great concern lie at uncertainties? Job's
friends would persuade him that all his hope was but the hope of the
hypocrite, [Job 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#006.md). "Nay," says he,
"I would not, for all the world, be so foolish as to build upon such a
rotten foundation; for what is the hope of the hypocrite?" See here,
(1.) The hypocrite deceived. He has gained, and he has hope; this is his
bright side. It is allowed that he has gained by his hypocrisy, has
gained the praise and applause of men and the wealth of this world. Jehu
gained a kingdom by his hypocrisy and the Pharisees many a widow's
house. Upon this gain he builds his hope, such as it is. He hopes he is
in good circumstances for another world, because he finds he is so for
this, and he blesses himself in his own way. (2.) The hypocrite
undeceived. He will at last see himself wretchedly cheated; for, \[1.\]
God shall take away his soul, sorely against his will. [Luk
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#020.md), Thy soul shall be required of
thee. God, as the Judge, takes it away to be tried and determined to its
everlasting state. He shall then fall into the hands of the living God,
to be dealt with immediately. \[2.\] What will his hope be then? It will
be vanity and a lie; it will stand him in no stead. The wealth of this
world, which he hoped in, he must leave behind him, [Psa
49:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#017.md). The happiness of the other
world, which he hoped for, he will certainly miss of. He hoped to go to
heaven, but he will be shamefully disappointed; he will plead his
external profession, privileges, and performances, but all his pleas
will be overruled as frivolous: Depart from me, I know you not. So that,
upon the whole, it is certain that a formal hypocrite, with all his
gains and all his hopes, will be miserable in a dying hour.

2\. Because the hypocrite's prayer will not be heard ([Job
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#009).md): Will God hear his cry when
trouble comes upon him? No, he will not; it cannot be expected he
should. If true repentance come upon him, God will hear his cry and
accept him ([Isa 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018).md); but, if he
continue impenitent and unchanged, let him not think to find favour with
God. Observe, (1.) Trouble will come upon him, certainly it will.
Troubles in the world often surprise those that are most secure of an
uninterrupted prosperity. However, death will come, and trouble with it,
when he must leave the world and all his delights in it. The judgment of
the great day will come; fearfulness will surprise the hypocrites, [Isa
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014). (2..md) Then he will cry to God,
will pray, and pray earnestly. Those who in prosperity slighted God,
either prayed not at all or were cold and careless in prayer, when
trouble comes will make their application to him and cry as men in
earnest. But, (3.) Will God hear him then? In the troubles of this life,
God has told us that he will not hear the prayers of those who regard
iniquity in their hearts ([Psa 66:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#019).md)
and set up their idols there ([Eze
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#004).md), nor of those who turn away
their ear from hearing the law, [Pro
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#009.md). Get you to the gods whom you
have served, [Jdg 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#014.md). In the
judgment to come, it is certain, God will not hear the cry of those who
lived and died in their hypocrisy. Their doleful lamentations will all
be unpitied. I will laugh at your calamity. Their importunate petitions
will all be thrown out and their pleas rejected. Inflexible justice
cannot be biassed, nor the irreversible sentence revoked. See [Mat
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#022.md), [Mat
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023.md); [Luk
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#026.md), and the case of the foolish
virgins, [Mat 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#011.md).

3\. Because the hypocrite's religion is neither comfortable nor constant
([Job 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#010).md): Will he delight himself
in the Almighty? No, not at any time (for his delight is in the profits
of the world and the pleasures of the flesh, more than in God),
especially not in the time of trouble. Will he always call upon God? No,
in prosperity he will not call upon God, but slight him; in adversity he
will not call upon God but curse him; he is weary of his religion when
he gets nothing by it, or is in danger of losing. Note, (1.) Those are
hypocrites who, though they profess religion, neither take pleasure in
it nor persevere in it, who reckon their religion a task and a drudgery,
a weariness, and snuff at it, who make use of it only to serve a turn,
and lay it aside when the turn is served, who will call upon God while
it is in fashion, or while the pang of devotion lasts, but leave it off
when they fall into other company, or when the hot fit is over. (2.) The
reason why hypocrites do not persevere in religion is because they have
no pleasure in it. Those that do not delight in the Almighty will not
always call upon him. The more comfort we find in our religion the more
closely we shall cleave to it. Those who have no delight in God are
easily inveigled by the pleasures of sense, and so drawn away from their
religion; and they are easily run down by the crosses of this life, and
so driven away from their religion, and will not always call upon God.

[Job 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 27:11</span></span>

Job's friends had seen a great deal of the misery and destruction that
attend wicked people, especially oppressors; and Job, while the heat of
disputation lasted, had said as much, and with as much assurance, of
their prosperity; but now that the heat of the battle was nearly over he
was willing to own how far he agreed with them, and where the difference
between his opinion and theirs lay. 1. He agreed with them that wicked
people are miserable people, that God will surely reckon with cruel
oppressors, and one time or other, one way or other, his justice will
make reprisals upon them for all the affronts they have put upon God and
all the wrongs they have done to their neighbours. This truth is
abundantly confirmed by the entire concurrence even of these angry
disputants in it. But, 2. In this they differed - they held that these
deserved judgments are presently and visibly brought upon wicked
oppressors, that they travail with pain all their days, that in
prosperity the destroyer comes upon them, that they shall not be rich,
nor their branch green, and that their destruction shall be accomplished
before their time (so Eliphaz, [Job
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#020.md), [Job
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#021.md), [Job
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#029.md), [Job
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#032).md), that the steps of their
strength shall be straitened, that terrors shall make them afraid on
every side (so Bildad, [Job 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#007.md), [Job
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#011).md), that he himself shall vomit up
his riches, and that in the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in
straits, so Zophar, [Job 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#015.md), [Job
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#022.md). Now Job held that, in many
cases, judgments do not fall upon them quickly, but are deferred for
some time. That vengeance strikes slowly he had already shown (ch. 21
and 24); now he comes to show that it strikes surely and severely, and
that reprieves are no pardons.

I. Job here undertakes to set this matter in a true light ([Job
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#011.md), [Job
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#012).md): I will teach you. We must not
disdain to learn even from those who are sick and poor, yea, and peevish
too, if they deliver what is true and good. Observe, 1. What he would
teach them: "That which is with the Almighty," that is, "the counsels
and purposes of God concerning wicked people, which are hidden with him,
and which you cannot hastily judge of; and the usual methods of his
providence concerning them." This, says Job, will I not conceal. What
God has not concealed from us we must not conceal from those we are
concerned to teach. Things revealed belong to us and our children. 2.
How he would teach them: By the hand of God, that is, by his strength
and assistance. Those who undertake to teach others must look to the
hand of God to direct them, to open their ear ([Isa
50:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004).md), and to open their lips. Those
whom God teaches with a strong hand are best able to teach others, [Isa
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#011.md). 3. What reason they had to learn
those things which he was about to teach them ([Job
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#012).md), that it was confirmed by their
own observation - You yourselves have seen it (but what we have heard,
and seen and known, we have need to be taught, that we may be perfect in
our lesson), and that it would set them to rights in their judgment
concerning him - "Why then are you thus altogether vain, to condemn me
for a wicked man because I am afflicted?" Truth, rightly understood and
applied, would cure us of that vanity of mind which arises from our
mistakes. That particularly which he offers now to lay before them is
the portion of a wicked man with God, particularly of oppressors, [Job
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#013.md). Compare [Job
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#029.md). Their portion in the world may
be wealth and preferment, but their portion with God is ruin and misery.
They are above the control of any earthly power, it may be, but the
Almighty can deal with them.

II\. He does it, by showing that wicked people may, in some instances,
prosper, but that ruin follows them in those very instances; and that is
their portion, that is their heritage, that is it which they must abide
by.

1\. They may prosper in their children, but ruin attends them. His
children perhaps are multiplied ([Job
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#014)) or magnified (so some.md); they
are very numerous and are raised to honour and great estates. Worldly
people are said to be full of children ([Psa
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014).md), and, as it is in the margin
there, their children are full. In them the parents hope to live and in
their preferment to be honoured. But the more children they leave, and
the greater prosperity they leave them in, the more and the fairer marks
do they leave for the arrows of God's judgments to be levelled at, his
three sore judgments, sword, famine, and pestilence, [Sa2
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#013). (1..md) Some of them shall die by
the sword, the sword of war perhaps (they brought them up to live by
their sword, as Esau, [Gen 27:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#040.md), and
those that do so commonly die by the sword, first or last), or by the
sword of justice for their crimes, or the sword of the murderer for
their estates. (2.) Others of them shall die by famine ([Job
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#014).md): His offspring shall not be
satisfied with bread. He thought he had secured to them large estates,
but it may happen that they may be reduced to poverty, so as not to have
the necessary supports of life, at least not to live comfortably. They
shall be so needy that they shall not have a competency of necessary
food, and so greedy, or so discontented, that what they have they shall
not be satisfied with, because not so much, or not so dainty, as what
they have been used to. You eat, but you have not enough, [Hag
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#006). (3..md) Those that remain shall be
buried in death, that is, shall die of the plague, which is called death
([Rev 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#008).md), and be buried privately
and in haste, as soon as they are dead, without any solemnity, buried
with the burial of an ass; and even their widows shall not weep; they
shall not have wherewithal to put them in mourning. Or it denotes that
these wicked men, as they live undesired, so they die unlamented, and
even their widows will think themselves happy that they have got rid of
them.

2\. They may prosper in their estates, but ruin attends them too, [Job
27:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#016). (1..md) We will suppose them to
be rich in money and plate, in clothing and furniture. They heap up
silver in abundance as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay; they
have heaps of clothes about them, as plentiful as heaps of clay. Or it
intimates that they have such abundance of clothes that they are even a
burden to them. They lade themselves with thick clay, [Hab
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006.md). See what is the care and business
of worldly people - to heap up worldly wealth. Much would have more,
until the silver is cankered and the garments are moth-eaten, [Jam
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#002.md), [Jam
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#003.md). But what comes of it? He shall
never be the better for it himself; death will strip him, death will rob
him, if he be not robbed and stripped sooner, [Luk
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#020.md). Nay, God will so order it that
the just shall wear his raiment and the innocent shall divide his
silver. \[1.\] They shall have it, and divide it among themselves. In
some way or other Providence shall so order it that good men shall come
honestly by that wealth which the wicked man came dishonestly by. The
wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just, [Pro
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#022.md). God disposes of men's estates
as he pleases, and often makes their wills against their wills. The
just, whom he hated and persecuted, shall have rule over all his labour,
and, in due time, recover with interest what was violently taken from
him. The Egyptians' jewels were the Israelites' pay. Solomon observes
([Ecc 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#026).md) that God makes the sinners
drudges to the righteous; for the sinner he gives travail to gather and
heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. \[2.\] They
shall do good with it. The innocent shall not hoard the silver, as he
did that gathered it, but shall divide it to the poor, shall give a
portion to seven and also to eight, which is laying up the best
securities. Money is like manure, good for nothing if it be not spread.
When God enriches good men they must remember they are but stewards and
must give an account. What bad men bring a curse upon their families
with the ill-getting of good men bring a blessing upon their families
with the well-using of. He that by unjust gain increaseth his substance
shall gather it for him that will pity the poor, [Pro
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#008). (2..md) We will suppose them to
have built themselves strong and stately houses; but they are like the
house which the moth makes for herself in an old garment, out of which
she will soon be shaken, [Job 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#018.md).
He is very secure in it, as a moth, and has no apprehension of danger;
but it will prove of as short continuance as a booth which the keeper
makes, which will quickly be taken down and gone, and his place shall
know him no more.

3\. Destruction attends their persons, though they lived long in health
and at ease ([Job 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#019).md): The rich man
shall lie down to sleep, to repose himself in the abundance of his
wealth (Soul, take thy ease), shall lie down in it as his strong city,
and seem to others to be very happy and very easy; but he shall not be
gathered, that is, he shall not have his mind composed, and settled, and
gathered in, to enjoy his wealth. He does not sleep so contentedly as
people think he does. He lies down, but his abundance will not suffer
him to sleep, at least not so sweetly as the labouring man, [Ecc
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#012.md). He lies down, but he is full of
tossings to and fro till the dawning of the day, and then he opens his
eyes and he is not; he sees himself, and all he has, hastening away, as
it were, in the twinkling of an eye. His cares increase his fears, and
both together make him uneasy, so that, when we attend him to his bed,
we do not find him happy there. But, in the close, we are called to
attend his exit, and see how miserable he is in death and after death.

(1.) He is miserable in death. It is to him the king of terrors, [Job
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#020.md), [Job
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#021.md). When some mortal disease seizes
him what a fright is he in! Terrors take hold of him as waters, as if he
were surrounded by the flowing tides. He trembles to think of leaving
this world, and much more of removing to another. This mingles sorrow
and wrath with his sickness, as Solomon observes, [Ecc
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#017.md). These terrors put him either
\[1.\] Into a silent and sullen despair; and then the tempest of God's
wrath, the tempest of death, may be said to steal him away in the night,
when no one is aware or takes any notice of it. Or, \[2.\] Into an open
and clamorous despair; and then he is said to be carried away, and
hurled out of his place as with a storm, and with an east wind, violent,
and noisy, and very dreadful. Death, to a godly man, is like a fair gale
of wind to convey him to the heavenly country, but, to a wicked man, it
is like an east wind, a storm, a tempest, that hurries him away in
confusion and amazement, to destruction.

(2.) He is miserable after death. \[1.\] His soul falls under the just
indignation of God, and it is the terror of that indignation which puts
him into such amazement at the approach of death ([Job
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#022).md): For God shall cast upon him
and not spare. While he lived he had the benefit of sparing mercy; but
now the day of God's patience is over, and he will not spare, but pour
out upon him the full vials of his wrath. What God casts down upon a man
there is no flying from nor bearing up under. We read of his casting
down great stones from heaven upon the Canaanites ([Jos
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#011).md), which made terrible execution
among them; but what was that to his casting down his anger in its full
weight upon the sinner's conscience, like the talent of lead? [Zac
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#007.md), [Zac
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#008.md). The damned sinner, seeing the
wrath of God break in upon him, would fain flee out of his hand; but he
cannot: the gates of hell are locked and barred, and the great gulf
fixed, and it will be in vain to call for the shelter of rocks and
mountains. Those who will not be persuaded now to fly to the arms of
divine grace, which are stretched out to receive them, will not be able
to flee from the arms of divine wrath, which will shortly be stretched
out to destroy them. \[2.\] His memory falls under the just indignation
of all mankind ([Job 27:23](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#023).md): Men shall
clap their hands at him, that is, they shall rejoice in the judgments of
God, by which he is cut off, and be well pleased in his fall. When the
wicked perish there is shouting, [Pro
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#010.md). When God buries him men shall
hiss him out of his place, and leave on his name perpetual marks of
infamy. In the same place where he has been caressed and cried up he
shall be laughed at ([Psa 52:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#007).md) and
his ashes shall be trampled on.
