### [2 Chronicles Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 30:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have an account of the solemn passover which Hezekiah
kept in the first year of his reign. I. The consultation about it, and
the resolution he and his people came to for the observance of it ([Ch2
30:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#002).md). II. The invitation he sent to
Judah and Israel to come and keep it ([Ch2
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#001.md), [Ch2
30:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#006).md). III. The joyful celebration
of it ([Ch2 30:13-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#013).md). By this the
reformation, set on foot in the foregoing chapter, was greatly advanced
and established, and that nail in God's holy place clenched.

[2 Chronicles 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 30:1</span></span>

Here is, I. A passover resolved upon. That annual feast was instituted
as a memorial of the bringing of the children of Israel out of Egypt. It
happened that the reviving of the temple service fell within the
appointed days of that feast, the seventeenth day of the first month:
this brought that forgotten solemnity to mind. "What shall we do," says
Hezekiah, "about the passover? It is a very comfortable ordinance, and
has been long neglected. How shall we revive it? The time has elapsed
for this year; we cannot go about it immediately; the congregation is
thin, the people have not notice, the priests are not prepared, [Ch2
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#003.md). Must we defer it till another
year?" Many, it is likely, were for deferring it; but Hezekiah
considered that by that time twelve-month the good affections of the
people would cool, and it would be too long to want the benefit of the
ordinance; and therefore, finding a proviso in the law of Moses that
particular persons who were unclean in the first month might keep the
passover the fourteenth day of the second month and be accepted ([Num
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#011).md), he doubted not but that it
might be extended to the congregation. Whereupon they resolved to keep
the passover in the second month. Let the circumstance give way to the
substance, and let not the thing itself be lost upon a nicety about the
time. It is good striking while the iron is hot, and taking people when
they are in a good mind. Delays are dangerous.

II\. A proclamation issued out to give notice of this passover and to
summon the people to it.

1\. An invitation was sent to the ten revolted tribes to stir them up to
come and attend this solemnity. Letters were written to Ephraim and
Manasseh to invite them to Jerusalem to keep this passover ([Ch2
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#001).md), not with any political design,
to bring them back to the house of David, but with a pious design to
bring them back to the Lord God of Israel. "Let them take whom they will
for their king," says Hezekiah, "so they will but take him for their
God." The matters in difference between Judah and Israel, either upon a
civil or sacred account, shall not hinder but that if the people of
Israel will sincerely return to the Lord their God Hezekiah will bid
them as welcome to the passover as any of his own subjects. Expresses
are sent post throughout all the tribes of Israel with memorials
earnestly pressing the people to take this opportunity of returning to
the God from whom they had revolted. Now here we have,

(1.) The contents of the circular letters that were despatched upon the
occasion, in which Hezekiah discovers a great concern both for the
honour of God and for the welfare of the neighbouring kingdom, the
prosperity of which he seems passionately desirous of, though he not
only received no toll, tribute, or custom, from it, but it had often,
and not long since, been vexatious to his kingdom. This is rendering
good for evil. Observe,

\[1.\] What it is which he presses them to ([Ch2
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#008).md): "Yield yourselves unto the
Lord. Before you can come into communion with him you must come into
covenant with him." Give the hand to the Lord (so the word is), that is,
"Consent to take him for your God." A bargain is confirmed by giving the
hand. "Strike this bargain. Join yourselves to him in an everlasting
covenant. Subscribe with the hand to be his, [Isa
44:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#005.md). Give him your hand, in token of
giving him your heart. Lay your hand to his plough. Devote yourselves to
his service, to work for him. Yield to him," that is, "Come up to his
terms, come under his government, stand it not out any longer against
him." "Yield to him, to be absolutely and universally at his command, at
his disposal, to be, and do, and have, and suffer, whatever he pleases.
In order to this, be not stiff-necked as your fathers were; let not your
corrupt and wicked wills rise up in resistance of and rebellion against
the will of God. Say not that you will do what you please, but resolve
to do what he pleases." There is in the carnal mind a stiffness, an
obstinacy, an unaptness to comply with God. We have it from our fathers;
it is bred in the bone with us. This must be conquered; and the will
that had in it a spirit of contradiction must be melted into the will of
God; and to his yoke the neck that was an iron sinew must be bowed and
fitted. In pursuance of this resignation to God, he presses them to
enter into his sanctuary, that is, to attend upon him in that place
which he had chosen, to put his name there, and serve him in the
ordinances which he had appointed. "The doors of the sanctuary are now
opened, and you have liberty to enter; the temple service is now
revived, and you are welcome to join in it." The king says, Come; the
princes and priests say, Come; whosoever will, let him come. This he
calls ([Ch2 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#006).md) turning to the Lord
God; for they had forsaken him, and worshipped other gods. Repent now,
and be converted. Thus those who through grace have turned to God
themselves should do all they can to bring others back to him.

\[2.\] What arguments he uses to persuade them to do this. First, "You
are children of Israel, and therefore stand related, stand obliged, to
the God of Israel, from whom you have revolted." Secondly, "The God you
are called to return to is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, a God
in covenant with your first fathers, who served him and yielded
themselves to him; and it was their honour and happiness that they did
so." Thirdly, "Your late fathers that forsook him and trespassed against
him have been given up to desolation; their apostasy and idolatry have
been their ruin, as you see ([Ch2
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#007).md); let their harms be your
warnings." Fourthly, "You yourselves are but a remnant narrowly escaped
out of the hands of the kings of Assyria ([Ch2
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#006).md), and therefore are concerned to
put yourselves under the protection of the God of your fathers, that you
be not quite swallowed up." Fifthly, "This is the only way of turning
away the fierceness of God's anger from you ([Ch2
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#008).md), which will certainly consume
you if you continue stiff-necked." Lastly, "If you return to God in a
way of duty, he will return to you in a way of mercy." This he begins
with ([Ch2 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#006).md) and concludes with,
[Ch2 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#009.md). In general, "You will find
him gracious and merciful, and one that will not turn away his face from
you, if you seek him, notwithstanding the provocations you have given
him." Particularly, "You may hope that he will turn again the captivity
of your brethren that are carried away, and bring them back to their own
land." Could any thing be expressed more pathetically, more movingly?
Could there be a better cause, or could it be better pleaded?

(2.) The entertainment which Hezekiah's messengers and message met with.
It does not appear that Hoshea, who was now king of Israel, took any
umbrage from, or gave any opposition to, the dispersing of these
proclamations through his kingdom, nor that he forbade his subjects to
accept the invitation. He seems to have left them entirely to their
liberty. They might go to Jerusalem to worship if they pleased; for,
though he did evil, yet not like the kings of Israel that were before
him, [Kg2 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#002.md). He saw ruin coming
upon his kingdom, and, if any of his subjects would try this expedient
to prevent it, they had his full permission. But, for the people, \[1.\]
The generality of them slighted the call and turned a deaf ear to it.
The messengers went from city to city, some to one and some to another,
and used pressing entreaties with the people to come up to Jerusalem to
keep the passover; but they were so far from complying with the message
that they abused those that brought it, laughed them to scorn, and
mocked them ([Ch2 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#010).md), not only
refused, but refused with disdain. Tell them of the God of Abraham! they
knew him not, they had other gods to serve, Baal and Ashtaroth. Tell
them of the sanctuary! their high places were as good. Tell them of
God's mercy and wrath! they neither dreaded the one nor desired the
other. No marvel that the king's messengers were thus despitefully used
by this apostate race when God's messengers were so, his servants the
prophets, who produced credentials from him. The destruction of the
kingdom of the ten tribes was now at hand. It was but two or three years
after this that the king of Assyria laid siege to Samaria, which ended
in the captivity of those tribes. Just before this they had not only a
king of their own that permitted them to return to God's sanctuary, but
a king of Judah that earnestly invited them to do it. Had they generally
accepted this invitation, it might have prevented their ruin; but their
contempt of it hastened and aggravated it, and left them inexcusable.
\[2.\] Yet there were some few that accepted the invitation. The
message, though to some it was a savour of death unto death, was to
others a savour of life unto life, [Ch2
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#011.md). In the worst of times God has
had a remnant; so he had here, many of Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun
(here is no mention of any out of Ephraim, though some of that tribe are
mentioned, [Ch2 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#018).md), humbled
themselves, and came to Jerusalem, that is, were sorry for their sins
and submitted to God. Pride keeps men from yielding themselves to the
Lord; when that is brought down, the work is done.

2\. A command was given to the men of Judah to attend this solemnity;
and they universally obeyed it, v. 12. They did it with one heart, were
all of a mind in it, and the hand of God gave them that one heart; for
it is in the day of power that Christ's subjects are made willing. It is
God that works both to will and to do. When people, at any time,
manifest an unexpected forwardness to do that which is good, we must
acknowledge that hand of God in it.

[2 Chronicles 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 30:13</span></span>

The time appointed for the passover having arrived, a very great
congregation came together upon the occasion, [Ch2
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#013.md). Now here we have,

I. The preparation they made for the passover, and good preparation it
was: They took away all the idolatrous altars that were found, not only
in the temple, but in Jerusalem, [Ch2
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#014.md). Before they kept the feast,
they cast out this old leaven. The best preparation we can make for the
gospel passover is to cast away our iniquities, our spiritual
idolatries.

II\. The celebration of the passover. In this the people were so forward
and zealous that the priests and Levites blushed to see themselves
out-done by the commonalty, to see them more ready to bring sacrifices
than they were to offer them. This put them upon sanctifying themselves
([Ch2 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#015).md), that the work might not
stand still for want of hands to carry it on. The notice we take of the
zeal of others should make us ashamed of our own coldness, and quicken
us not only to do our duty, but to do it well, and to sanctify ourselves
to it. They did according to the duty of their place ([Ch2
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#016).md), sprinkling the blood upon the
altar, which was a type of Christ our passover sacrificed for us.

III\. The irregularities they were guilty of in this solemnity. The
substance was well managed, and with a great deal of devotion; but,
besides that it was a month out of time, 1. The Levites killed the
passover, which should have been done by the priests only, [Ch2
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#017.md). They also assisted more than
the law ordinarily allowed in offering the other sacrifices,
particularly those that were for the purifying of the unclean, many of
which there was now occasion for. Some think that it was the offerers'
work, not the priests', that the Levites had here the charge of.
Ordinarily every man killed his lamb, but now for those that were under
any ceremonial pollution the Levites killed it. 2. Many were permitted
to eat the passover who were not purified according to the strictness of
the law, [Ch2 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#018.md). This was the
second month, and there was not warrant to put them off further to the
third month, as, if it had been the first month, the law would have
permitted them to eat it the second. And they were loth to forbid them
communicating at all, lest they should discourage new converts, and send
those away complaining whom they desired to send away rejoicing. Grotius
observes from this that ritual institutions must give way, not only to a
public necessity, but to a public benefit and advantage.

IV\. Hezekiah's prayer to God for the forgiveness of this irregularity.
It was his zeal that had called them together in such haste, and he
would not that any should fare the worse for being straitened of time in
their preparation. He therefore thought himself concerned to be an
intercessor for those that ate the passover otherwise than it was
written, that there might not be wrath upon them from the Lord. His
prayer was,

1\. A short prayer, but to the purpose: The good Lord pardon every one
in the congregation that has fixed, engaged, or prepared, his heart to
those services, though the ceremonial preparation be wanting. Note, (1.)
The great thing required in our attendance upon God in solemn ordinances
is that we prepare our hearts to seek him, that we be sincere and
upright in all we do, that the inward man be engaged and employed in it,
and that we make heart-work of it; it is all nothing without this.
Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward part. Hezekiah does not pray
that this might be dispensed with, nor that the want of other things
might be pardoned where there was not this. For this is the one thing
needful, that we seek God, his favour, his honour, and that we set our
hearts to do it. (2.) Where this sincerity and fixedness of heart are
there may still be many defects and infirmities, both the frame of the
spirit and the performance of the service may be short of the
purification of the sanctuary. Corruptions may not be so fully
conquered, thoughts not so closely fixed, affections not so lively,
faith not so operative, as they should be. Here is a defect in sanctuary
purification. There is nothing perfect under the sun, nor a just man
that doeth good, and sinneth not. (3.) These defects need pardoning
healing grace; for omissions in duty are sins as well as omissions of
duty. If God should deal with us in strict justice according to the best
of our performances, we should be undone. (4.) The way to obtain pardon
for our deficiencies in duty, and all the iniquities of our holy things,
is to seek it of God by prayer; it is not so a pardon of course but that
it must be obtained by petition through the blood of Christ. (5.) In
this prayer we must take encouragement from the goodness of God: The
good Lord pardon; for, when he proclaimed his goodness, he insisted most
upon this branch of it, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin. (6.)
It is the duty of those that have the charge of others, not only to look
to themselves, but to those also that are under their charge, to see
wherein they are wanting, and to pray for them, as Hezekiah here. See
[Job 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#005.md).

2\. A successful prayer: The Lord hearkened to Hezekiah, was well
pleased with his pious concern for the congregation, and, in answer to
his prayer, healed the people ([Ch2
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#020).md), not only did not lay their sin
to their charge, but graciously accepted their services notwithstanding;
for healing denotes not only forgiveness ([Isa
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010.md); [Psa
103:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#003).md), but comfort and peace, [Isa
57:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#018.md); [Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002.md).

[2 Chronicles 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 30:21</span></span>

After the passover followed the feast of unleavened bread, which
continued seven days. How that was observed we are here told, and every
thing in this account looks pleasant and lively. 1. Abundance of
sacrifices were offered to God in peace-offerings, by which they both
acknowledged and implored the favour of God, and on part of which the
offerers feasted with their friends during these seven days ([Ch2
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#022).md), in token of their communion
with God and the comfort they took in his favour and their
reconciliation to him. To keep up this part of the service, that God's
altar might be abundantly regaled with the fat and blood and his priests
and people with the flesh of the peace-offerings, Hezekiah gave out of
his own stock 1000 bullocks and 7000 sheep, and the princes, excited by
his pious example, gave the same number of bullocks and a greater number
of sheep, and all for peace-offerings, [Ch2
30:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#024.md). By this God was honoured, the
joy of the festival was kept up, and the strangers were encouraged to
come again to Jerusalem. It was generously done of the king and the
princes thus plentifully to entertain the whole congregation; but what
is a great estate good for but that it puts men into a capacity of doing
so much the more good? Christ feasted those that followed him. I believe
neither Hezekiah nor his princes were the poorer at the year's end for
this their pious liberality. 2. Many good prayers were put up to God
with the peace-offerings, [Ch2 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#022.md).
They made confession to the Lord God of their fathers, in which the
intent and meaning of the peace-offerings were directed and explained.
When the priests sprinkled the blood and burnt the fat they made
confession, so did the people when they feasted on their part. They made
a religious confession of their relation to God and dependence upon him,
a penitent confession of their sins and infirmities, a thankful
confession of God's mercies to them, and a supplicatory confession of
their wants and desires; and, in all these, they had an eye to God as
the God of their fathers, a God in covenant with them. 3. There was a
great deal of good preaching. The Levites (whose office it was, [Deu
33:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#010).md) taught the people the good
knowledge of the Lord, read and opened the scriptures, and instructed
the congregation concerning God and their duty to him; and great need
there was of this, after so long a famine of the word as there had been
in the last reign. Hezekiah did not himself preach, but he spoke
comfortably to the Levites that did, attended their preaching, commended
their diligence, and assured them of his protection and countenance.
Hereby he encouraged them to study hard and take pains, and put a
reputation upon them, that the people might respect and regard them the
more. Princes and magistrates, by owning and encouraging faithful and
laborious preachers, greatly serve the interest of God's kingdom among
men. 4. They sang psalms every day ([Ch2
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#021).md): The Levites and priests
praised the Lord day by day, both with songs and musical instruments,
thus expressing their own and exciting one another's joy in God and
thankfulness to him. Praising God should be much of our work in our
religious assemblies. 5. Having kept the seven days of the feast in this
religious manner, they had so much comfort in the service that they kept
other seven days, [Ch2 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#023.md). They did
not institute any new modes of worship, but repeated and continued the
old. The case was extraordinary: they had been long without the
ordinance; guilt had been contracted by the neglect of it; they had now
got a very great congregation together, and were in a devout serious
frame; they knew not when they might have such another opportunity, and
therefore could not now find in their hearts to separate till they had
doubled the time. Many of them were a great way from home, and had
business in the country to look after, for, this being the second month,
they were in the midst of their harvest; yet they were in no haste to
return: the zeal of God's house made them forget their secular affairs.
How unlike those who snuffed at God's service, and said, What a
weariness is it! Or those who asked, When will the sabbath be gone? The
servants of God should abound in his work. 6. All this they did with
gladness ([Ch2 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#023).md); they all
rejoiced, and particularly the strangers, [Ch2
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#025.md). So there was great joy in
Jerusalem, [Ch2 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#026.md). Never was the
like since the dedication of the temple in Solomon's time. Note, Holy
duties should be performed with holy gladness; we should be forward to
them, and take pleasure in them, relish the sweetness of communion with
God, and look upon it as matter of unspeakable joy and comfort that we
are thus favoured and have such earnests of everlasting joy. 7. The
congregation was at length dismissed with a solemn blessing, [Ch2
30:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#027). (1..md) The priests pronounced it;
for it was part of their office to bless the people ([Num
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#022.md), [Num
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#023).md), in which they were both the
people's mouth to God by way of prayer and God's mouth to the people by
way of promise; for their blessing included both. In it they testified
both their desire of the people's welfare and their dependence upon God
and that word of his grace to which they commended them. What a comfort
is it to a congregation to be sent home thus crowned! (2.) God said Amen
to it. The voice of the priests, when they blessed the people, was heard
in heaven and came up to the habitation of God's holiness. When they
pronounced the blessing God commanded it, and perhaps gave some sensible
token of the ratification of it. The prayer that comes up to heaven in a
cloud of incense will come down again to this earth in showers of
blessings.
