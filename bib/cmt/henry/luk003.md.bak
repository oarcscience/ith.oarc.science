### [Luke Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001.md)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 3:0</span></span>

Nothing is related concerning our Lord Jesus from his twelfth year to
his entrance on his thirtieth year. We often think it would have been a
pleasure and advantage to us if we had journals, or at least annuls, of
occurrences concerning him; but we have as much as Infinite Wisdom
thought fit to communicate to us, and, if we improve not that, neither
should we have improved more if we had had it. The great intention of
the evangelists was to give us an account of the gospel of Christ, which
we are to believe, and by which we hope for salvation: now that began in
the ministry and baptism of John, and therefore they hasten to give us
an account of that. We could wish, perhaps, that Luke had wholly passed
by what was related by Matthew and Mark, and had written only what was
new, as he has done in his two first chapters. But it was the will of
the Spirit that some things should be established out of the mouth, not
only of two, but of three witnesses; and we must not reckon it a
needless repetition, nor shall we do so if we renew out meditations upon
these things, with suitable affections. In this chapter we have, I. The
beginning of John's baptism, and the scope and intention of it ([Luk
3:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001).md). His exhortation to the
multitude ([Luk 3:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#007).md), and the
particular instructions he gave to those who desired to be told their
duty ([Luk 3:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#010).md). II. The notice he
gave them of the approach of the Messiah ([Luk
3:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#015).md), to which is added (though it
happened after what follows) the mention of his imprisonment ([Luk
3:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#019).md). III. Christ coming to be
baptized of John, and his entrance therein upon the execution of his
prophetical office ([Luk 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#021.md), [Luk
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#022).md). IV. His pedigree and genealogy
recorded up to Adam (v. 23-38).

[Luke 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 3:1</span></span>

John's baptism introducing a new dispensation, it was requisite that we
should have a particular account of it. Glorious things were said of
John, what a distinguished favourite of Heaven he should be, and what a
great blessing to this earth ([Luk
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#015.md), [Luk
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017).md); but we lost him in the deserts,
and there he remains until the day of his showing unto Israel, [Luk
1:80](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#080.md). And now at last that day dawns,
and a welcome day it was to them that waited for it more than they that
waited for the morning. Observe here,

I. The date of the beginning of John's baptism, when it was that he
appeared; this is here taken notice of, which was not by the other
evangelists, that the truth of the thing might be confirmed by the exact
fixing of the time. And it is dated,

1\. By the government of the heathen, which the Jews were under, to show
that they were a conquered people, and therefore it was time for the
Messiah to come to set up a spiritual kingdom, and an eternal one, upon
the ruins of all the temporal dignity and dominion of David and Judah.

(1.) It is dated by the reign of the Roman emperor; it was in the
fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar, the third of the twelve Caesars, a
very bad man, given to covetousness, drunkenness, and cruelty; such a
man is mentioned first (saith Dr. Lightfoot), as it were, to teach us
what to look for from that cruel and abominable city wherein Satan
reigned in all ages and successions. The people of the Jews, after a
long struggle, were of late made a province of the empire, and were
under the dominion of this Tiberius; and that country which once had
made so great a figure, and had many nations tributaries to it, in the
reigns of David and Solomon, is now itself an inconsiderable despicable
part of the Roman empire, and rather trampled upon than triumphed in.

\- En quo discordia cives, Perduxit miseros

\- What dire effects from civil discord flow!

The lawgiver was now departed from between Judah's feet; and, as an
evidence of that, their public acts are dated by the reign of the Roman
emperor, and therefore now Shiloh must come.

(2.) It is dated by the governments of the viceroys that ruled in the
several parts of the Holy Land under the Roman emperor, which was
another badge of their servitude, for they were all foreigners, which
bespeaks a sad change with that people whose governors used to be of
themselves ([Jer 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#021).md), and it was
their glory. How is the gold become dim! \[1.\] Pilate is here said to
be the governor, president, or procurator, of Judea. This character is
given of him by some other writers, that he was a wicked man, and one
that made no conscience of a lie. He reigned ill, and at last was
displaced by Vitellius, president of Syria, and sent to Rome, to answer
for his mal-administrations. \[2.\] The other three are called
tetrarchs, some think from the countries which they had the command of,
each of them being over a fourth part of that which had been entirely
under the government of Herod the Great. Others think that they are so
called from the post of honour they held in the government; they had the
fourth place, or were fourth-rate governors: the emperor was the first,
the pro-consul, who governed a province, the second, a king the third,
and a tetrarch the fourth. So Dr. Lightfoot.

2\. By the government of the Jews among themselves, to show that they
were a corrupt people, and that therefore it was time that the Messiah
should come, to reform them, [Luk 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#002.md).
Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests. God had appointed that there
should be but one high priest at a time, but here were two, to serve
some ill turn or other: one served one year and the other the other
year; so some. One was the high priest, and the other the sagan, as the
Jews called him, to officiate for him when he was disabled; or, as
others say, one was high priest, and represented Aaron, and that was
Caiaphas; Annas, the other, was nasi, or head of the sanhedrim, and
represented Moses. But to us there is but one high priest, one Lord of
all, to whom all judgment is committed.

II\. The origin and tendency of John's baptism.

1\. The origin of it was from heaven: The word of God came unto John,
[Luk 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#002.md). He received full commission
and full instructions from God to do what he did. It is the same
expression that is used concerning the Old Testament prophets ([Jer
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#002).md); for John was a prophet, yea,
more than a prophet, and in him prophecy revived, which had been long
suspended. We are not told how the word of the Lord came to John,
whether by an angel, as to his father, or by dream, or vision, or voice,
but it was to his satisfaction, and ought to be to ours. John is here
called the son of Zacharias, to refer us to what the angel said to his
father, when he assured him that he should have this son. The word of
the Lord came to him in the wilderness; for those whom God fits he will
find out, wherever they are. As the word of the Lord is not bound in a
prison, so it is not lost in a wilderness. The word of the Lord made its
way to Ezekiel among the captives by the river of Chebar, and to John in
the isle of Patmos. John was the son of a priest, now entering upon the
thirtieth year of his age; and therefore, according to the custom of the
temple, he was now to be admitted into the temple-service, where he
should have attended as a candidate five years before. But God had
called him to a more honourable ministry, and therefore the Holy Ghost
enrols him here, since he was not enrolled in the archives of the
temple: John the son of Zacharias began his ministration such a time.

2\. The scope and design of it were to bring all the people of his
country off from their sins and home to their God, [Luk
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#003.md). He came first into all the
country about Jordan, the neighbourhood wherein he resided, that part of
the country which Israel took possession of first, when they entered the
land of promise under Joshua's conduct; there was the banner of the
gospel first displayed. John resided in the most solitary part of the
country: but, when the word of the Lord came to him, he quitted his
deserts, and came into the inhabited country. Those that are best
pleased in their retirements must cheerfully exchange them, when God
calls them into places of concourse. He came out of the wilderness into
all the country, with some marks of distinction, preaching a new
baptism; not a sect, or party, but a profession, or distinguishing
badge. The sign, or ceremony, was such as was ordinarily used among the
Jews, washing with water, by which proselytes were sometimes admitted,
or disciples to some great master; but the meaning of it was, repentance
for the remission of sins: that is, all that submitted to his baptism,

(1.) Were thereby obliged to repent of their sins, to be sorry for what
they had done amiss, and to do so no more. The former they professed,
and were concerned to be sincere in their professions; the latter they
promised, and were concerned to make good what they promised. He bound
them, not to such ceremonious observances as were imposed by the
tradition of the elders, but to change their mind, and change their way,
to cast away from them all their transgressions, and to make them new
hearts and to live new lives. The design of the gospel, which now began,
was to make men devout and pious, holy and heavenly, humble and meek,
sober and chaste, just and honest, charitable and kind, and good in
every relation, who had been much otherwise; and this is to repent.

(2.) They were thereby assured of the pardon of their sins, upon their
repentance. As the baptism he administered bound them not to submit to
the power of sin, so it sealed to them a gracious and pleadable
discharge from the guilt of sin. Turn yourselves from all your
transgressions, so iniquity shall not be your ruin; agreeing with the
word of the Lord, by the Old Testament prophets, [Eze
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#030.md).

III\. The fulfilling of the scriptures in the ministry of John. The
other evangelists had referred us to the same text that is here referred
to, that of Esaias, [Isa 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md). It is
written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, which he heard
from God, which he spoke for God, those words of his which were written
for the generations to come. Among them it is found that there should be
the voice of one crying in the wilderness; and John is that voice, a
clear distinct voice, a loud voice, an articulate one; he cries, Prepare
ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight. John's business is
to make way for the entertainment of the gospel in the hearts of the
people, to bring them into such a frame and temper as that Christ might
be welcome to them, and they welcome to Christ. Luke goes further on
with the quotation than Matthew and Mark had done, and applies the
following words likewise to John's ministry ([Luk
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#005.md), [Luk
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#006).md), Every valley shall be filled.
Dr. Hammond understands this as a prediction of the desolation coming
upon the people of the Jews for their infidelity: the land should be
made plain by the pioneers for the Roman army, and should be laid waste
by it, and there should then be a visible distinction made between the
impenitent on the one side and the receivers of the gospel on the other
side. But it seems rather to be meant of the gospel of Christ, of which
that was the introduction. 1. The humble shall by it be enriched with
grace: Every valley that lies low and moist shall be filled and be
exalted. 2. The proud shall by it be humbled; the self-confident that
stand upon their own bottom, and the self-conceited that lift up their
own top, shall have contempt put upon them: Every mountain and hill
shall be brought low. If they repent, they are brought to the dust; if
not, to the lowest hell. 3. Sinners shall be converted to God: The
crooked ways and the crooked spirits shall be made straight; for, though
none can make that straight which God hath made crooked ([Ecc
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#013).md), yet God by his grace can make
that straight which sin hath made crooked. 4. Difficulties that were
hindering and discouraging in the way to heaven shall be removed: The
rough ways shall be made smooth; and they that love God's law shall have
great peace, and nothing shall offend them. The gospel has made the way
to heaven plain and easy to be found, smooth and easy to be walked in.
5. The great salvation shall be more fully discovered than ever, and the
discovery of it shall spread further ([Luk
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#006).md): All flesh shall see the
salvation of God; not the Jews only, but the Gentiles. All shall see it;
they shall have it set before them and offered to them, and some of all
sorts shall see it, enjoy it, and have the benefit of it. When way is
made for the gospel into the heart, by the captivation of high thoughts
and bringing them into obedience to Christ, by the leveling of the soul
and the removing of all obstructions that stand in the way of Christ and
his grace, then prepare to bid the salvation of God welcome.

IV\. The general warnings and exhortations which he gave to those who
submitted to his baptism, [Luk 3:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#007.md).
In Matthew he is said to have preached these same things to many of the
Pharisees and Sadducees, that came to his baptism ([Mat
3:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007).md); but here he is said to have
spoken them to the multitude, that came forth to be baptized of him,
[Luk 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#007.md). This was the purport of his
preaching to all that came to him, and he did not alter it in compliment
to the Pharisees and Sadducees, when they came, but dealt as plainly
with them as with any other of his hearers. And as he did not flatter
the great, so neither did he compliment the many, or make his court to
them, but gave the same reproofs of sin and warnings of wrath to the
multitude that he did to the Sadducees and Pharisees; for, if they had
not the same faults, they had others as bad. Now observe here,

1\. That the guilty corrupted race of mankind is become a generation of
vipers; not only poisoned, but poisonous; hateful to God, hating one
another. This magnifies the patience of God, in continuing the race of
mankind upon the earth, and not destroying that nest of vipers. He did
it once by water, and will again by fire.

2\. This generation of vipers is fairly warned to flee from the wrath to
come, which is certainly before them if they continue such; and their
being a multitude will not be at all their security, for it will be
neither reproach nor loss to God to cut them off. We are not only warned
of this wrath, but are put into a way to escape it, if we look about us
in time.

3\. There is no way of fleeing from the wrath to come, but by
repentance. They that submitted to the baptism of repentance thereby
evidenced that they were warned to flee from the wrath to come and took
the warning; and we by our baptism profess to have fled out of Sodom,
for fear of what is coming upon it.

4\. Those that profess repentance are highly concerned to live like
penitents ([Luk 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#008).md): "Bring forth
therefore fruits meet for repentance, else, notwithstanding your
professions of repentance, you cannot escape the wrath to come." By the
fruits of repentance it will be known whether it be sincere or no. By
the change of our way must be evidenced the change of our mind.

5\. If we be not really holy, both in heart and life, our profession of
religion and relation to God and his church will stand us in no stead at
all: Begin not now to frame excuses from this great duty of repentance,
by saying within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father. What will it
avail us to be the children of godly parents if we be not godly, to be
within the pale of the Church if we be not brought into the bond of the
covenant?

6\. We have therefore no reason to depend upon our external privileges
and professions of religion, because God has no need of us or of our
services, but can effectually secure by his own honour and interest
without us. If we were cut off and ruined, he could raise up to himself
a church out of the most unlikely, - children to Abraham even out of
stones.

7\. The greater professions we make of repentance, and the greater
assistances and encouragements are given us to repentance, the nearer
and the sorer will our destruction be if we do not bring forth fruits
meet for repentance. Now that the gospel begins to be preached, now that
the kingdom of heaven is at hand, now that the axe is laid to the root
of the tree, threatenings to the wicked and impenitent are now more
terrible than before, as encouragements to the penitent are now more
comfortable. "Now that you are upon your behaviour, look to yourselves."

8\. Barren trees will be cast into the fire at length; it is the fittest
place for them: Every tree that doth not bring forth fruit, good fruit,
is hewn down, and cast into the fire. If it serve not for fruit, to the
honour of God's grace, let it serve for fuel, to the honour of his
justice.

V. The particular instructions he gave to several sorts of persons, that
enquired of him concerning their duty: the people, the publicans, and
the soldiers. Some of the Pharisees and Sadducees came to his baptism;
but we do not find them asking, What shall we do? They thought they knew
what they had to do as well as he could tell them, or were determined to
do what they pleased, whatever he told them. But the people, the
publicans, and the soldiers, who knew that they had done amiss, and that
they ought to do better, and were conscious to themselves of great
ignorance and unacquaintedness with the divine law, were particularly
inquisitive: What shall we do? Note, 1. Those that are baptized must be
taught, and those that have baptized them are concerned, as they have
opportunity, to teach them, [Mat
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019.md), [Mat
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020.md). 2. Those that profess and
promise repentance in general must evidence it by particular instances
of reformation, according as their place and condition are. 3. They that
would do their duty must desire to know their duty, and enquire
concerning it. The first good word Paul said, when he was converted,
was, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? These here enquire, not, What
shall this man do? but, What shall we do? What fruits meet for
repentance shall we bring forth? Now John gives answer to each,
according to their place and station.

(1.) He tells the people their duty, and that is to be charitable ([Luk
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#011).md): He that has two coats, and,
consequently, one to spare, let him give, or lend at least, to him that
has none, to keep him warm. Perhaps he saw among his hearers some that
were overloaded with clothes, while others were ready to perish in rags,
and he puts those who had superfluities upon contributing to the relief
of those that had not necessaries. The gospel requires mercy, and not
sacrifice; and the design of it is to engage us to do all the good we
can. Food and raiment are the two supports of life; he that hath meat to
spare, let him give to him that is destitute of daily food, as well as
he that hath clothes to spare: what we have we are but stewards of, and
must use it, accordingly, as our Master directs.

(2.) He tells the publicans their duty, the collectors of the emperor's
revenue ([Luk 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#013).md): Exact no more
than that which is appointed you. They must do justice between the
government and the merchant, and not oppress the people in levying the
taxes, nor any way make them heavier or more burdensome than the law had
made them. They must not think that because it was their office to take
care that the people did not defraud the prince they might therefore, by
the power they had, bear hard upon the people; as those that have ever
so little a branch of power are apt to abuse it: "No, keep to your book
of rates, and reckon it enough that you collect for Caesar the things
that are Caesar's, and do not enrich yourselves by taking more." The
public revenues must be applied to the public service, and not to
gratify the avarice of private persons. Observe, He does not direct the
publicans to quit their places, and to go no more to the receipt of
custom; the employment is in itself lawful and necessary, but let them
be just and honest in it.

(3.) He tells the soldiers their duty, [Luk
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#014.md). Some think that these soldiers
were of the Jewish nation and religion: others think that they were
Romans; for it was not likely either that the Jews would serve the
Romans or that the Romans would trust the Jews in their garrisons in
their own nation; and then it is an early instance of Gentiles embracing
the gospel and submitting to it. Military men seldom seem inclined to
religion; yet these submitted even to the Baptist's strict profession,
and desired to receive the word of command from him: What must we do?
Those who more than other men have their lives in their hands, and are
in deaths often, are concerned to enquire what they shall do that they
may be found in peace. In answer to this enquiry, John does not bid them
lay down their arms, and desert the service, but cautions them against
the sins that soldiers were commonly guilty of; for this is fruit meet
for repentance, to keep ourselves from our iniquity. \[1.\] They must
not be injurious to the people among whom they were quartered, and over
whom indeed they were set: "Do violence to no man. Your business is to
keep the peace, and prevent men's doing violence to one another; but do
not you do violence to any. Shake no man" ( so the word signifies); "do
not put people into fear; for the sword of war, as well as that of
justice, is to be a terror only to evil doers, but a protection to those
that do well. Be not rude in your quarters; force not money from people
by frightening them. Shed not the blood of war in peace; offer no
incivility either to man or woman, nor have any hand in the barbarous
devastations that armies sometimes make." Nor must they accuse any
falsely to the government, thereby to make themselves formidable, and
get bribes. \[2.\] They must not be injurious to their fellow-soldiers;
for some think that caution, not to accuse falsely, has special
reference to them: "Be not forward to complain one of another to your
superior officers, that you may be revenged on those whom you have a
pique against, or undermine those above you, and get into their places."
Do not oppress any; so some think the word here signifies as used by the
Septuagint in several passages of the Old Testament. \[3.\] They must
not be given to mutiny, or contend with their generals about their pay:
"Be content with your wages. While you have what you agreed for, do not
murmur that it is not more." It is discontent with what they have that
makes men oppressive and injurious; they that never think they have
enough themselves will not scruple at any the most irregular practices
to make it more, by defrauding others. It is a rule to all servants that
they be content with their wages; for they that indulge themselves in
discontents expose themselves to many temptations, and it is wisdom to
make the best of that which is.

[Luke 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 3:15</span></span>

We are now drawing near to the appearance of our Lord Jesus publicly;
the Sun will not be long after the morning-star. We are here told,

I. How the people took occasion, from the ministry and baptism of John,
to think of the Messiah, and to think of him as at the door, as now
come. Thus the way of the Lord was prepared, and people were prepared to
bid Christ welcome; for, when men's expectations are raised, that which
they are in expectation of becomes doubly acceptable. Now when they
observed what an excellent doctrine John Baptist preached, what a divine
power went along with it, and what a tendency it had to reform the
world, 1. They began presently to consider that now was the time for the
Messiah to appear. The sceptre was departed from Judah, for they had no
king but Caesar; nay, and the law-giver too was gone from between his
feet, for Herod had lately slain the sanhedrim. Daniel's seventy weeks
were now expiring; and therefore it was but three or four years after
this that they looked that the kingdom of heaven should appear
immediately, [Luk 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#011.md). Never did the
corrupt state of the Jews more need a reformation, nor their distressed
state more need a deliverance, than now. 2. Their next thought was, "Is
not his he that should come?" All thinking men mused, or reasoned, in
their hearts, concerning John, whether he were the Christ or not. He had
indeed none of the external pomp and grandeur in which they generally
expected the Messiah to appear; but his life was holy and strict, his
preaching powerful and with authority, and therefore "why may we not
think that he is the Messiah, and that he will shortly throw off this
disguise, and appear in more glory?" Note, That which puts people upon
considering, reasoning with themselves, prepares the way for Christ.

II\. How John disowned all pretensions to the honour of being himself
the Messiah, but confirmed them in their expectations of him that really
was the Messiah, [Luk 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#016.md), [Luk
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#017.md). John's office, as a crier or
herald, was to give notice that the kingdom of God and the King of that
kingdom were at hand; and therefore, when he had told all manner of
people severally what they must do ("You must do this, and you must do
that"), he tells them one thing more which they must all do: they must
expect the Messiah now shortly to appear. And this serves as an answer
to their musings and debates concerning himself. Though he knew not
their thoughts, yet, in declaring this, he answered them.

1\. He declares that the utmost he could do was to baptize them with
water. He had no access to the Spirit, nor could command that or work
upon that; he could only exhort them to repent, and assure them of
forgiveness, upon repentance; he could not work repentance in them, nor
confer remission on them.

2\. He consigns them, and turns them over, as it were, to Jesus Christ,
for whom he was sent to prepare the way, and to whom he was ready to
transfer all the interest he had in the affections of the people, and
would have them no longer to debate whether John was the Messiah or no,
but to look for him that was really so.

(1.) John owns the Messiah to have a greater excellency than he had, and
that he was in all things preferable to him; he is one the latchet of
whose shoe he does not think himself worthy to loose; he does not think
himself worthy to be the meanest of his servants, to help him on and off
with his shoes. John was a prophet, yea more than a prophet, more so
than any of the Old Testament prophets; but Christ was a prophet more
than John, for it was both by the Spirit of Christ, and of the grace of
Christ, that all the prophets prophesied, and John among the rest, [Pe1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010.md), [Pe1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011.md). This was a great truth which
John came to preach; but the manner of his expressing it bespeaks his
humility, and in it he not only does justice to the Lord Jesus, but does
him honour too: "He is one whom I am not worthy to approach, or draw
nigh to, no not as a servant." Thus highly does it become us to speak of
Christ, and thus humbly of ourselves.

(2.) He owns him to have a greater energy than he had: "He is mightier
than I, and does that which I cannot do, both for the comfort of the
faithful and for the terror of hypocrites and dissemblers." They thought
that a wonderful power went along with John; but what was that compared
with the power which Jesus would come clothed with? \[1.\] John can do
no more than baptize with water, in token of this, that they ought to
purify and cleanse themselves; but Christ can, and will, baptize with
the Holy Ghost; he can give the Spirit to cleanse and purify the heart,
not only as water washes off the dirt on the outside, but as fire purges
out the dross that is within, and melts down the metal, that it may be
cast into a new mould. \[2.\] John can only preach a distinguishing
doctrine, and by word and sign separate between the precious and the
vile; but Christ hath his fan in his hand, with which he can, and will,
perfectly separate between the wheat and the chaff. He will thoroughly
purge his floor; it is his own, and therefore he will purge it, and will
cast out of his church the unbelieving impenitent Jews, and confirm in
his church all that faithfully follow him. \[3.\] John can only speak
comfort to those that receive the gospel, and, like other prophets, say
to the righteous that it shall be well with them; but Jesus Christ will
give them comfort. John can only promise them that they shall be safe;
but Christ will make them so: he will gather the wheat into his garner;
good, serious, solid people he will gather now into his church on earth,
which shall be made up of such, and he will shortly gather them into his
church in heaven, where they shall be for ever sheltered. \[4.\] John
can only threaten hypocrites, and tell the barren trees that they shall
be hewn down and cast into the fire; but Christ can execute that
threatening; those that are as chaff, light, and vain, and worthless, he
will burn with fire unquenchable. John refers here to [Mal
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#018.md); [Mal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001.md), [Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002.md). Then, when the floor is purged,
ye shall return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, for
the day comes that shall burn as an oven.

The evangelist concludes his account of John's preaching with an et
caetera ([Luk 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#018).md): Many other things
in his exhortation preached he unto the people, which are not recorded.
First, John was an affectionate preacher. He was parakalōn - exhorting,
beseeching; he pressed things home upon his hearers, followed his
doctrine close, as one in earnest. Secondly, He was a practical
preacher. Much of his preaching was exhortation, quickening them to
their duty, directing them in it, and not amusing them with matters of
nice speculation. Thirdly, He was a popular preacher. Though he had
scribes and Pharisees, men of polite learning, attending his ministry,
and Sadducees, men of free thought, as they pretended, yet he addressed
himself to the people, pros ton laon - to the laity, and accommodated
himself to their capacity, as promising himself best success among them.
Fourthly, He was an evangelical preacher, for so the word here used
signifies, euēngelizeto - he preached the gospel to the people; in all
his exhortations, he directed people to Christ, and excited and
encouraged their expectations of him. When we press duty upon people, we
must direct them to Christ, both for righteousness and strength.
Fifthly, He was a copious preacher: Many other things he preached, polla
men kai hetera - many things, and different. He preached a great deal,
shunned not to declare the whole counsel of God; and he varied in his
preaching, that those who were not reached, and touched, and wrought
upon, by one truth, might be by another.

III\. How full a stop was put to John's preaching. When he was in the
midst of his usefulness, going on thus successfully, he was imprisoned
by the malice of Herod ([Luk 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#019.md),
[Luk 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#020).md): Herod the tetrarch being
reproved by him, not only for living in incest with his brother Philip's
wife, but for the many other evils which Herod had done (for those that
are wicked in one instance are commonly so in many others), he could not
bear it, but contracted an antipathy to him for his plain dealing, and
added this wickedness to all the rest, which was indeed above all, that
he shut up John in prison, put that burning and shining light under a
bushel. Because he could not bear his reproofs, others should be
deprived of the benefit of his instructions and counsels. Some little
good he might do to those who had access to him, when he was in prison;
but nothing to what he might have done if he had had liberty to go about
all the country, as he had done. We cannot think of Herod's doing this
without the greatest compassion and lamentation, nor of God's permitting
it without admiring the depth of the divine counsels, which we cannot
account for. Must he be silenced who is the voice of one crying in the
wilderness? Must such a preacher be shut up in prison who ought to have
been set up in the courts of the temple? But thus the faith of his
disciples must be tried; thus the unbelief of those who rejected him
must be punished; thus he must be Christ's forerunner in suffering as
well as preaching; and thus, having been for about a year and a half
preparing people for Christ, he must now give way to him, and, the Sun
being risen, the morning-star must of course disappear.

[Luke 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 3:21</span></span>

The evangelist mentioned John's imprisonment before Christ's being
baptized, though it was nearly a year after it, because he would finish
the story of John's ministry, and then introduce that of Christ. Now
here we have,

I. A short account of Christ's baptism, which had been more fully
related by St. Matthew. Jesus came, to be baptized of John, and he was
so, [Luk 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#021.md), [Luk
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#022.md).

1\. It is here said that, when all the people were baptized, then Jesus
was baptized: all that were then present. Christ would be baptized last,
among the common people, and in the rear of them; thus he humbled
himself, and made himself of no reputation, as one of the least, nay, as
less than the least. He saw what multitudes were hereby prepared to
receive him, and then he appeared.

2\. Notice is here taken of Christ's praying when he was baptized, which
was not in Matthew: being baptized, and praying. He did not confess sin,
as others did, for he had none to confess; but he prayed, as others did,
for he would thus keep up communion with his Father. Note, The inward
and spiritual grace of which sacraments are the outward and visible
signs must be fetched in by prayer; and therefore prayer must always
accompany them. We have reason to think that Christ now prayed for this
manifestation of God's favour to him which immediately followed; he
prayed for the discovery of his Father's favour to him, and the descent
of the Spirit. What was promised to Christ, he must obtain by prayer:
Ask of me and I will give thee, etc. Thus he would put an honour upon
prayer, would tie us to it, and encourage us in it.

3\. When he prayed, the heaven was opened. He that by his power parted
the waters, to make a way through them to Canaan, now by his power
parted the air, another fluid element, to open a correspondence with the
heavenly Canaan. Thus was there opened to Christ, and by him to us, a
new and living way into the holiest; sin had shut up heaven, but
Christ's prayer opened it again. Prayer is an ordinance that opens
heaven: Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.

4\. The Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him; our
Lord Jesus was now to receive greater measures of the Spirit than
before, to qualify him for his prophetical office, [Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md). When he begins to preach, the
Spirit of the Lord is upon him. Now this is here expressed by a sensible
evidence for his encouragement in his work, and for the satisfaction of
John the Baptist; for he was told before that by this sign it should be
notified to him which was the Christ. Dr. Lightfoot suggests that the
Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape, that he might be revealed to be
a personal substance, and not merely an operation of the Godhead: and
thus (saith he) was made a full, clear, and sensible demonstration of
the Trinity, at the beginning of the gospel; and very fitly is this done
at Christ's baptism, who was to make the ordinance of baptism a badge of
the profession of that faith in the doctrine of the Trinity, Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost.

5\. There came a voice from heaven, from God the Father, from the
excellent glory (so it is expressed, [Pe2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#017).md), Thou art my beloved Son. Here,
and in Mark, it is expressed as spoken to Christ; in Matthew as spoken
of him: This is my beloved Son. It comes all to one; it was intended to
be a notification to John, and as such was properly expressed by, This
is my beloved Son; and likewise an answer to his prayer, and so it is
most fitly expressed by. Thou art. It was foretold concerning the
Messiah, I will be his Father, and he shall be my Son, [Sa2
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014.md). I will make him my First-born,
[Psa 89:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#027.md). It was also foretold that
he should be God's elect, in whom his soul delighted ([Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001).md); and, accordingly, it is here
declared, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

II\. A long account of Christ's pedigree, which had been more briefly
related by St. Matthew. Here is,

1\. His age: He now began to be about thirty years of age. So old Joseph
was when he stood before Pharaoh ([Gen
41:46](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#046).md), David when he began to reign
([Sa2 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#004).md), and at this age the
priests were to enter upon the full execution of their office, [Num
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#003.md). Dr. Lightfoot thinks that it is
plain, by the manner of expression here, that he was just twenty-nine
years old complete, and entering upon his thirtieth year, in the month
Tisri; that, after this, he lived three years and a half, and died when
he was thirty-two years and a half old. Three years and a half, the time
of Christ's ministry, is a period of time very remarkable in scripture.
Three years and six months the heavens were shut up in Elijah's time,
[Luk 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#025.md); [Jam
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#017.md). This was the half week in which
the Messiah was to confirm the covenant, [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md). This period is expressed in the
prophetical writings by a time, times, and half a time ([Dan
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007.md); [Rev
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#014).md); and by forty-two months, and a
thousand two hundred and threescore days, [Rev
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002.md), [Rev
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#003.md). It is the time fixed for the
witnesses' prophesying in sackcloth, in conformity to Christ's preaching
in his humiliation just so long.

2\. His pedigree, [Luk 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#023.md), etc.
Matthew had given us somewhat of this. He goes no higher than Abraham,
but Luke brings it as high as Adam. Matthew designed to show that Christ
was the son of Abraham, in whom all the families of the earth are
blessed, and that he was heir to the throne of David; and therefore he
begins with Abraham, and brings the genealogy down to Jacob, who was the
father of Joseph, and heir-male of the house of David: but Luke,
designing to show that Christ was the seed of the woman, that should
break the serpent's head, traces his pedigree upward as high as Adam,
and begins it with Ei, or Heli, who was the father, not of Joseph, but
of the virgin Mary. And some suggest that the supply which our
translators all along insert here is not right, and that it should not
be read which, that is, which Joseph was the son of Heli, but which
Jesus; he was the son of Joseph, of Eli, of Matthat, etc., and he, that
is, Jesus, was the son of Seth, of Adam, of God, [Luk
3:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#038.md). The difference between the two
evangelists in the genealogy of Christ has been a stumbling-block to
infidels that cavil at the word, but such a one as has been removed by
the labours of learned men, both in the early ages of the church and in
latter times, to which we refer ourselves. Matthew draws the pedigree
from Solomon, whose natural line ending in Jechonias, the legal right
was transferred to Salathiel, who was of the house of Nathan, another
son of David, which line Luke here pursues, and so leaves out all the
kings of Judah. It is well for us that our salvation doth not depend
upon our being able to solve all these difficulties, nor is the divine
authority of the gospels at all weakened by them; for the evangelists
are not supposed to write these genealogies either of their own
knowledge or by divine inspiration, but to have copied them out of the
authentic records of the genealogies among the Jews, the heralds' books,
which therefore they were obliged to follow; and in them they found the
pedigree of Jacob, the father of Joseph, to be as it is set down in
Matthew; and the pedigree of Heli, the father of Mary, to be as it is
set down here in Luke. And this is the meaning of hōs enomizeto ([Luk
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#023).md), not, as it was supposed,
referring only to Joseph, but uti sancitum est lege - as it is entered
into the books, as we find it upon record; by which is appeared that
Jesus was both by father and mother's side the Son of David, witness
this extract out of their own records, which any one might at that time
have liberty to compare with the original, and further the evangelists
needed not to go; nay, had they varied from that, they had not gained
their point. Its not being contradicted at that time is satisfaction
enough to us now that it is a true copy, as it is further worthy of
observation, that, when those records of the Jewish genealogies had
continued thirty or forty years after these extracts out of them, long
enough to justify the evangelists therein, they were all lost and
destroyed with the Jewish state and nation; for now there was no more
occasion for them.

One difficulty occurs between Abraham and Noah, which gives us some
perplexity, [Luk 3:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#035.md), [Luk
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#036.md). Sala is said to be the son of
Cainan, and he the son of Arphaxad, whereas Sala was the son of Arphaxad
([Gen 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#024.md); [Gen
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#012).md), and there is no such man as
Cainan found there. But, as to that, it is sufficient to say that the
Seventy Interpreters, who, before our Saviour's time, translated the Old
Testament into Greek, for reasons best known to themselves inserted that
Cainan; and St. Luke, writing among the Hellenist Jews, was obliged to
make use of that translation, and therefore to take it as he found it.

The genealogy concludes with this, who was the son of Adam, the son of
God. (1.) Some refer it to Adam; he was in a peculiar manner the son of
God, being, more immediately than any of his offspring, the offspring of
God by creation. (2.) Others refer it to Christ, and so make the last
words of this genealogy to denote his divine and human nature. He was
both the Son of Adam and the Son of God that he might be a proper
Mediator between God and the sons of Adam, and might bring the sons of
Adam to be, through him, the sons of God.
