### [Acts Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#001.md)

[Acts](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">act 14:0</span></span>

We have, in this chapter, a further account of the progress of the
gospel, by the ministry of Paul and Barnabas among the Gentiles; it goes
on conquering and to conquer, yet meeting with opposition, as before,
among the unbelieving Jews. Here is, I. Their successful preaching of
the gospel for some time at Iconium, and their being driven thence by
the violence of their persecutors, both Jews and Gentiles, and forced
into the neighbouring countries ([Act
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#001).md). II. Their healing a lame man
at Lystra, and the profound veneration which the people conceived of
them thereupon, which they had much ado to keep from running into an
extreme ([Act 14:8-18](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#008).md). III. The
outrage of the people against Paul, at the instigation of the Jews, the
effect of which was that they stoned him, as they thought, to death; but
he was wonderfully restored to life ([Act
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019.md), [Act
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#020).md). IV. The visit which Paul and
Barnabas made to the churches which they had planted, to confirm them,
and put them into order ([Act
14:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#021).md). V. They return to Antioch,
whence they were sent forth; the good they did by the way, and the
report they made to the church of Antioch of their expedition, and, if I
may so say, of the campaign they had made ([Act
14:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#024).md).

[Acts 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 14:1</span></span>

In these verses we have,

I. The preaching of the gospel in Iconium, whither the apostles were
forced to retire from Antioch. As the blood of the martyrs has been the
seed of the church, so the banishment of the confessors has helped to
scatter that seed. Observe, 1. How they made the first offer of the
gospel to the Jews in their synagogues; thither they went, not only as
to a place of meeting, but as to a place of meeting with them, to whom,
wherever they came, they were to apply themselves in the first place.
Though the Jews at Antioch had used them barbarously, yet they did not
therefore decline preaching the gospel to the Jews at Iconium, who
perhaps might be better disposed. Let not those of any denomination be
condemned in the gross, nor some suffer for others' faults; but let us
do good to those who have done evil to us. Though the blood-thirsty hate
the upright, yet the just seek their soul ([Pro
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#010).md), seek the salvation of it. 2.
How the apostles concurred herein. Notice is taken of this, that they
went both together into the synagogue, to testify their unanimity and
mutual affection, that people might say, See how they love one another,
and might think the better of Christianity, and that they might
strengthen one another's hands and confirm one another's testimony, and
out of the mouth of two witnesses every word might be established. They
did not go one one day and another another, nor one go at the beginning
and the other some time after; but they went in both together.

II\. The success of their preaching there: They so spoke that a great
multitude, some hundreds perhaps, if not thousands, both of the Jews and
also of the Greeks, that is the Gentiles, believed. Observe here, 1.
That the gospel was now preached to Jews and Gentiles together, and
those of each denomination that believed came together into the church.
In the close of the foregoing chapter it was preached first to the Jews,
and some of them believed, and then to the Gentiles, and some of them
believed; but here they are put together, being put upon the same level.
The Jews have not so lost their preference as to be thrown behind, only
the Gentiles are brought to stand upon even terms with them; both are
reconciled to God in one body ([Eph
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#016).md), and both together admitted into
the church without distinction. 2. There seems to have been something
remarkable in the manner of the apostles' preaching here, which
contributed to their success: They so spoke that a great multitude
believed - so plainly, so convincingly, with such an evidence and
demonstration of the Spirit, and with such power; they so spoke, so
warmly, so affectionately, and with such a manifest concern for the
souls of men, that one might perceive they were not only convinced, but
filled, with the things they spoke of, and that what they spoke came
from the heart and therefore was likely to reach to the heart; they so
spoke, so earnestly and so seriously, so boldly and courageously, that
those who heard them could not but say that God was with them of a
truth. Yet the success was not to be attributed to the manner of their
preaching, but to the Spirit of God, who made use of that means.

III\. The opposition that their preaching met with there, and the
trouble that was created them; lest they should be puffed up with the
multitude of their converts, there was given them this thorn in the
flesh. 1. Unbelieving Jews were the first spring of their trouble here,
as elsewhere ([Act 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#002).md): they stirred
up the Gentiles. The influence which the gospel had upon many of the
Gentiles, and their embracing it, as it provoked some of the Jews to a
holy jealousy and stirred them up to receive the gospel too ([Rom
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#014).md), so it provoked others of them
to a wicked jealousy, and exasperated them against the gospel. Thus as
good instructions, so good examples, which to some are a savour of life
unto life, to others are a savour of death unto death. See [Co2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#015.md), [Co2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016.md). 2. Disaffected Gentiles,
irritated by the unbelieving Jews, were likely to be the instruments of
their trouble. The Jews, by false suggestions, which they were
continually buzzing in the ears of the Gentiles, made their minds evil
affected against the brethren, whom of themselves they were inclined to
think favourably of. They not only took occasion in all companies, as it
came in their way, but made it their business to go purposely to such as
they had any acquaintance with, and said all that their wit or malice
could invent to beget in them not only a mean but an ill opinion of
Christianity, telling them how destructive it would certainly be to
their pagan theology and worship; and, for their parts, they would
rather be Gentiles than Christians. Thus they soured and embittered
their spirits against both the converters and the converted. The old
serpent did, by their poisonous tongues, infuse his venom against the
seed of the woman into the minds of these Gentiles, and this was a root
of bitterness in them, bearing gall and wormwood. It is no wonder if
those who are ill affected towards good people wish ill to them, speak
ill of them, and contrive ill against them; it is all owing to ill will.
Ekakōsan, they molested and vexed the minds of the Gentiles (so some of
the critics take it); they were continually teasing them with their
impertinent solicitations. The tools of persecutors have a dog's life,
set on continually.

IV\. Their continuance in their work there, notwithstanding this
opposition, and God's owning them in it, [Act
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#003.md). We have here, 1. The apostles
working for Christ, faithfully and diligently, according to the trust
committed to them. Because the minds of the Gentiles were evil affected
against them, one would think that therefore they should have withdrawn,
and hastened out of the way, or, if they had preached, should have
preached cautiously, for fear of giving further provocation to those who
were already enough enraged. No; on the contrary, therefore they abode
there a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord. The more they perceived
the spite and rancour of the town against the new converts, the more
they were animated to go on in their work, and the more needful they saw
it to continue among them, to confirm them in the faith, and to comfort
them. They spoke boldly, and were not afraid of giving offence to the
unbelieving Jews. What God said to the prophet, with reference to the
unbelieving Jews in his day, was now made good to the apostles: I have
made thy face strong against their faces, [Eze
3:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#007.md). But observe what it was that
animated them: They spoke boldly in the Lord, in his strength, and
trusting in him to bear them out; not depending upon any thing in
themselves. They were strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
2. Christ working with the apostles, according to his promise, Lo, I am
with you always. When they went on in his name and strength, he failed
not to give testimony to the word of his grace. Note, (1.) The gospel is
a word of grace, the assurance of God's good will to us and the means of
his good work in us. It is the word of Christ's grace, for it is in him
alone that we find favour with God. (2.) Christ himself has attested
this word of grace, who is the Amen, the faithful witness; he has
assured us that it is the word of God, and that we may venture our souls
upon it. As it was said in general concerning the first preachers of the
gospel that they had the Lord working with them, and confirming the word
by signs following ([Mar 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#020).md), so it
is said particularly concerning the apostles here that the Lord
confirmed their testimony, in granting signs and wonders to be done by
their hands - in the miracles they wrought in the kingdom of nature - as
well as the wonders done by their word, in the greater miracles wrought
on men's minds by the power of divine grace. The Lord was with them,
while they were with him, and abundance of good was done.

V. The division which this occasioned in the city ([Act
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#004).md): The multitude of the city was
divided into two parties, and both active and vigorous. Among the rulers
and persons of rank, and among the common people, there were some that
held with the unbelieving Jews, and others that held with the apostles.
Barnabas is here reckoned an apostle, though not one of the twelve, nor
called in the extra-ordinary manner that Paul was, because set apart by
special designation of the Holy Ghost to the service of the Gentiles. It
seems, this business of the preaching of the gospel was so universally
taken notice of with concern that every person, even of the multitude of
the city, was either for it or against it; none stood neuter. "Either
for us or for our adversaries, for God or Baal, for Christ or
Beelzebub." 1. We may here see the meaning of Christ's prediction that
he came not to send peace upon earth, but rather division, [Luk
12:51-53](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#051.md). If all would have given in
unanimously into his measures, there would have been universal concord;
and, could men have agreed in this, there would have been no dangerous
discord nor disagreement in other things; but, disagreeing here, the
breach was wide as the sea. Yet the apostles must not be blamed for
coming to Iconium, although before they came the city was united, and
now it was divided; for it is better that part of the city go to heaven
than all to hell. 2. We may here take the measures of our expectations;
let us not think it strange if the preaching of the gospel occasion
division, nor be offended at it; it is better to be reproached and
persecuted as dividers for swimming against the stream than yield
ourselves to be carried down the stream that leads to destruction. Let
us hold with the apostles, and not fear those that hold with the Jews.

VI\. The attempt made upon the apostles by their enemies. Their evil
affection against them broke out at length into violent outrages, [Act
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#005.md). Observe, 1. Who the plotters
were: Both the Gentiles and the Jews, with their rulers. The Gentiles
and Jews were at enmity with one another, and yet united against
Christians, like Herod and Pilate, Sadducees and Pharisees, against
Christ; and like Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, of old, against Israel. If
the church's enemies can thus unite for its destruction, shall not its
friends, laying aside all personal feuds, unite for its preservation? 2.
What the plot was. Having now got the rulers on their side, they doubted
not but to carry their point, and their design was to use the apostles
despitefully, to expose them to disgrace, and then to stone them, to put
them to death; and thus they hoped to sink their cause. They aimed to
take away both their reputation and their life, and this was all they
had to lose which men could take from them, for they had neither lands
nor goods.

VII\. The deliverance of the apostles out of the hands of those wicked
and unreasonable men, [Act 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#006.md), [Act
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#007.md). They got away, upon notice given
them of the design against them, or the beginning of the attempt upon
them, of which they were soon aware, and they made an honourable retreat
(for it was not an inglorious flight) to Lystra and Derbe; and there, 1.
They found safety. Their persecutors in Iconium were for the present
satisfied that they were thrust out of their borders, and pursued them
no further. God has shelters for his people in a storm; nay, he is, and
will be, himself their hiding place. 2. They found work, and this was
what they went for. When the door of opportunity was shut against them
at Iconium, it was opened at Lystra and Derbe. To these cities they
went, and there, and in the region that lieth round about, they preached
the gospel. In times of persecution ministers may see cause to quit the
spot, when yet they do not quit the work.

[Acts 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 14:8</span></span>

In these verses we have,

I. A miraculous cure wrought by Paul at Lystra upon a cripple that had
been lame from his birth, such a one as was miraculously cured by Peter
and John, [Act 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#002.md). That introduced
the gospel among the Jews, this among the Gentiles; both that and this
were designed to represent the impotency of all the children of men in
spiritual things: they are lame from their birth, till the grace of God
puts strength into them; for it was when we were yet without strength
that Christ died for the ungodly, [Rom
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#006.md). Observe here, 1. The deplorable
case of the poor cripple ([Act 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#008).md):
He was impotent in his feet, disabled (so the word is) to such a degree
that it was impossible he should set his foot to the ground, to lay any
stress upon it. It was well known that he had been so from his mother's
womb, and that he never had walked, nor could stand up. We should take
occasion hence to thank God for the use of our limbs; and those who are
deprived of it may observe that their case is not singular. 2. The
expectation that was raised in him of a cure ([Act
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#009).md): He heard Paul preach, and, it
is likely, was much affected with what he heard, believed that the
messengers, having their commission thence, had a divine power going
along with them, and were therefore able to cure him of his lameness.
This Paul was aware of, by the spirit of discerning that he had, and
perhaps the aspect of his countenance did in part witness for him: Paul
perceived that he had faith to be healed; desired it, hoped for it, had
such a thing in his thoughts, which it does not appear that the lame man
Peter healed had, for he expected no more than an alms. There was not
found such great faith in Israel as was among the Gentiles, [Mat
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#010.md). 3. The cure wrought: Paul,
perceiving that he had faith to be healed, brought the word and healed
him, [Psa 107:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#020.md). Note, God will not
disappoint the desires that are of his own kindling, nor the hopes of
his own raising. Paul spoke to him with a loud voice, either because he
was at some distance, or to show that the true miracles, wrought by the
power of Christ, were far unlike the lying wonders wrought by deceivers,
that peeped, and muttered, and whispered, [Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019.md). God saith, I have not spoken in
secret, in a dark place of the earth, [Isa
45:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#019.md). Paul spoke to him with a loud
voice, that the people about might take notice, and have their
expectations raised of the effect. It does not appear that this cripple
was a beggar; it is said ([Act 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#008).md)
that he sat, not that he sat begging. But we may imagine how melancholy
it was to him to see other people walking about him, and himself
disabled; and therefore how welcome Paul's word was to him, "Stand
upright on thy feet; help thyself, and God shall help thee; try whether
thou hast strength, and thou shalt find that thou hast." Some copies
read it, I say unto thee, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Stand
upright on thy feet. It is certain that this is implied, and very
probably was expressed, by Paul, and power went along with this word;
for presently he leaped and walked, leaped up from the place where he
sat, and not only stood upright, but to show that he was perfectly
cured, and that immediately, he walked to and fro before them all.
Herein the scripture was fulfilled, that when the wilderness of the
Gentile world is made to blossom as the rose then shall the lame man
leap as a hart, [Isa 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001.md), [Isa
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006.md). Those that by the grace of God
are cured of their spiritual lameness must show it by leaping with a
holy exultation and walking in a holy conversation.

II\. The impression which this cure made upon the people: they were
amazed at it, had never seen nor heard the like, and fell into an
ecstacy of wonder. Paul and Barnabas were strangers, exiles, refugees,
in their country; every thing concurred to make them mean and
despicable: yet the working of this one miracle was enough to make them
in the eyes of this people truly great and honourable, though the
multitude of Christ's miracles could not screen him from the utmost
contempt among the Jews. We find here, 1. The people take them for gods
([Act 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#011).md): They lifted up their
voices with an air of triumph, saying in their own language (for it was
the common people that said it), in the speech of Lycaonia, which was a
dialect of the Greek, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of
men. They imagined that Paul and Barnabas had dropped down to them out
of the clouds, and that they were some divine powers, no less than gods,
though in the likeness of men. This notion of the thing agreed well
enough with the pagan theology, and the fabulous account they had of the
visits which their gods made to this lower world; and proud enough they
were to think that they should have a visit made to them. They carried
this notion so far here that they pretended to tell which of their gods
they were, according to the ideas their poets had given them of the gods
([Act 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#012).md): They called Barnabas
Jupiter; for, if they will have him to be a god, it is as easy to make
him the prince of their gods as not. It is probable that he was the
senior, and the more portly comely man, that had something of majesty in
his countenance. And Paul they called Mercury, who was the messenger of
the gods, that was sent on their errands; for Paul, though he had not
the appearance that Barnabas had, was the chief speaker, and had a
greater command of language, and perhaps appeared to have something
mercurial in his temper and genius. Jupiter used to take Mercury along
with him, they said, and, if he make a visit to their city, they will
suppose he does so now. 2. The priest thereupon prepares to do sacrifice
to them, [Act 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#013.md). The temple of
Jupiter was, it seems, before the gate of their city, as its protector
and guardian; and the priest of that idol and temple, hearing the people
cry out thus, took the hint presently, and thought it was time for him
to bestir himself to do his duty: many a costly sacrifice he had offered
to the image of Jupiter, but if Jupiter be among them himself - in
propria persona, it concerns him to do him the utmost honours
imaginable; and the people are ready to join with him in it. See how
easily vain minds are carried away with a popular outcry. If the crowd
give a shout, Here is Jupiter, the priest of Jupiter takes the first
hint, and offers his service immediately. When Christ, the Son of God,
came down, and appeared in the likeness of men, and did many, very many
miracles, yet they were so far from doing sacrifice to him that they
made him a sacrifice to their pride and malice: He was in the world, and
the world knew him not; he came to his own, and his own received him
not; but Paul and Barnabas, upon the working of one miracle, are
immediately deified. The same power of the god of this world which
prejudices the carnal mind against truth makes errors and mistakes to
find easy admission; and both ways his turn is served. They brought
oxen, to be sacrificed to them, and garlands, with which to crown the
sacrifices. These garlands were made up of flowers and ribbons; and they
gilded the horns of the oxen they sacrificed.

Victimae ad supplicium saginantur,

hostiae ad poenam corenantur.

So beasts for sacrifice do feed,

First to be crown'd, and then to bleed.

\- So Octavius in Minutius Felix.

III\. Paul and Barnabas protest against this undue respect paid them,
and with much ado prevent it. Many of the heathen emperors called
themselves gods, and took a pride in having divine honours paid them:
but Christ's ministers, though real benefactors to mankind, while these
tyrants only pretended to be so, refused those honours when they were so
tendered. Whose successor therefore he is who sits in the temple of God,
and shows that he is god ([Th2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004).md),
and who is adored as our lord god, the pope, it is easy to say. Observe,

1\. The holy indignation which Paul and Barnabas conceived at this: When
they heard this, they rent their clothes. We do not find that they rent
their clothes when the people vilified them, and spoke of stoning them;
they could bear this without disturbance: but when they deified them,
and spoke of worshipping them, they could not bear it, but rent their
clothes, as being more concerned for God's honour than their own.

2\. The pains they took to prevent it. They did not connive at it, nor
say, "If people will be deceived, let them be deceived," much less
suggest to themselves and one another that it might contribute both to
the safety of their persons and the success of their ministry if they
suffered the people to continue in this mistake, and so they might make
a good hand of an ill thing. No, God's truth needs not the service of
man's lie. Christ had put honour enough upon them in making them
apostles, they needed not assume either the honour of princes or the
honour of gods; they appeared with much more magnificent titles when
they were called the ambassadors of Christ, and the stewards of the
mysteries of God, than when they were called Jupiter and Mercury. Let us
see how they prevented it.

(1.) They ran in among the people, as soon as they heard of it, and
would not so much as stay awhile to see what the people would do. Their
running in, like servants, among the people, showed that they were far
from looking upon themselves as gods, or taking state upon them; they
did not stand still, expecting honours to be done them, but plainly
declined them by thrusting themselves into the crowd. They ran in, as
men in earnest, with as much concern as Aaron ran in between the living
and the dead, when the plague was begun.

(2.) They reasoned with them, crying out, that all might hear, "Sirs,
why do you these things?" Why do you go about to make gods of us? It is
the most absurd thing you can do; for,

\[1.\] "Our nature will not admit it: We also are men of like passions
with you" homoiopatheis: it is the same word that is used concerning
Elias, [Jam 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#018.md), where we render it,
subject to like passions as we are. "We are men, and therefore you wrong
yourselves if you expect that from us which is to be had in God only;
and you wrong God if you give that honour to us, or to any other man,
which is to be given to God only. We not only have such bodies as you
see, but are of like passions with you, have hearts fashioned like as
other men ([Psa 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#015).md); for, as in
water face answers to face, so doth the heart of man to man, [Pro
27:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#019.md). We are naturally subject to the
same infirmities of the human nature, and liable to the same calamities
of the human life; not only men, but sinful men and suffering men, and
therefore will not be deified."

\[2.\] "Our doctrine is directly against it. Must we be added to the
number of your gods whose business it is to abolish the gods you have?
We preach unto you that you should turn from these vanities unto the
living God. If we should suffer this, we should confirm you in that
which it is our business to convert you from:" and so they take this
occasion to show them how just and necessary it was that they should
turn to God from idols, [Th1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009.md). When
they preached to the Jews, who hated idolatry, they had nothing to do
but to preach the grace of God in Christ, and needed not, as the
prophets in dealing with their fathers, to preach against idolatry: but,
when they had to do with the Gentiles, they must rectify their mistakes
in natural religion, and bring them off from the gross corruptions of
that. See here what they preached to the Gentiles.

First, That the gods which they and their fathers worshipped, and all
the ceremonies of their worship of them were vanities, idle things,
unreasonable, unprofitable, which no rational account could be given of,
nor any real advantage gained from. Idols are often called vanities in
the Old Testament, [Deu 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021.md); [Kg1
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#013.md); [Jer
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#022.md). An idol is nothing in the world
([Co1 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004).md): it is not at all what it
is pretended to be, it is a cheat, it is a counterfeit; it deceives
those that trust to it and expect relief from it. Therefore turn from
these vanities, turn from them with abhorrence and detestation, as
Ephraim did ([Hos 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#008).md): "What have I
to do any more with idols? I will never again be thus imposed upon."

Secondly, That the God to whom they would have them turn is the living
God. They had hitherto worshipped dead images, that were utterly unable
to help them ([Isa 64:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#009).md), or (as they
now attempted) dying men, that would soon be disabled to help them; but
now they are persuaded to worship a living God, who has life in himself,
and life for us, and lives for evermore.

Thirdly, That this God is the creator of the world, the fountain of all
being and power: "He made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all things
therein, even those things which you worship as gods, so that he is the
God of your gods. You worship gods which you made, the creatures of your
own fancy, and the work of your own hands. We call you to worship the
true God, and cheat not yourselves with pretenders; worship the
Sovereign Lord of all, and disparage not yourselves in bowing down to
his creatures and subjects."

Fourthly, That the world owed it to his patience that he had not
destroyed them long ere this for their idolatry ([Act
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#016).md): In times past, for many ages,
unto this day, he suffered all nations to walk in their own ways. These
idolaters, that were called from the service of other gods, might think,
"Have we not served these gods hitherto, and our fathers before us, time
out of mind; and why may we not as well go on to serve them still?" -
No, your serving them was a trial of God's patience, and it was a
miracle of mercy that you were not cut off for it. But, though he did
not destroy you for it while you were in ignorance, and knew no better
([Act 17:30](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#030).md) yet now that he has sent
his gospel into the world, and by it has made a clear discovery of
himself and his will to all nations, and not to the Jews only, if you
still continue in your idolatry he will not bear with you as he has
done. All the nations that had not the benefit of divine revelation,
that is, all but the Jews, he suffered to walk in their own ways, for
they had nothing to check them, or control them, but their own
consciences, their own thoughts ([Rom
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#015).md), no scriptures, no prophets; and
then they were the more excusable if they mistook their way: but now
that God has sent a revelation into the world which is to be published
to all nations the case is altered. We may under-stand it as a judgment
upon all nations that God suffered them to walk in their own ways, gave
them up to their own hearts' lusts; but now the time is come when the
veil of the covering spread over all nations should be taken off ([Isa
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#007).md), and now you will no longer be
excused in these vanities, but must turn from them. Note, 1. God's
patience with us hitherto should lead us to repentance, and not
encourage us to presume upon the continuance of it, while we continue to
provoke him. 2. Our having done ill while we were in ignorance will not
bear us out in doing ill when we are better taught.

Fifthly, That even when they were not under the direction and correction
of the word of God, yet they might have known, and should have known, to
do better by the works of God, [Act
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#017.md). Though the Gentiles had not the
statutes and judgments that the Jews had to witness for God against all
pretenders, no tables of testimony or tabernacle of testimony, yet he
left not himself without witness; besides the witness for God within
them (the dictates of natural conscience), they had witnesses for God
round about them - the bounty of common providence. Their having no
scriptures did in part excuse them, and therefore God did not destroy
them for their idolatry, as he did the Jewish nation. This however did
not wholly excuse them, but that notwithstanding this they were highly
criminal and deeply guilty before God; for there were other witnesses
for God, sufficient to inform them that he and he only is to be
worshipped, and that to him they owed all their services from whom they
received all their comforts, and therefore that they were guilty of the
highest injustice and ingratitude imaginable, in alienating them from
him. God, having not left himself without witness, has not left us
without a guide, and so has left us without excuse; for whatever is a
witness for God is a witness against us, if we give that glory to any
other which is due to him only. 1. The bounties of common providence
witness to us that there is a God, for they are all dispensed wisely and
with design. The rain and fruitful seasons could not come by chance, nor
are there any of the vanities of the heathen that can give rain, neither
can the heavens of themselves give showers, [Jer
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#022.md). All the powers of nature
witness to us a sovereign power in the God of nature, from whom they are
derived, and on whom they depend. It is not the heaven that gives us
rain, but God that gives us rain from heaven, he is the Father of the
rain, [Job 38:28](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#028.md). 2. The benefits we
have by these bounties witness to us that we ought to make our
acknowledgments not to the creatures who are made serviceable to us, but
to the Creator who makes them so. He left not himself without witness,
in that he did good. God seems to reckon the instances of his goodness
to be more pregnant, cogent proofs of his title to our homage and
adoration than the evidences of his greatness; for his goodness is his
glory. The earth is full of his goodness; his tender mercies are over
all his works; and therefore they praise him, [Psa
145:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#009.md), [Psa
145:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#010.md). God does us good, in
preserving to us his air to breathe in, his ground to go upon, the light
of his sun to see by; but, because the most sensible instance of the
goodness of Providence to each of us in particular is that of the daily
provision made by it of meat and drink for us, the apostle chooses to
insist upon that, and shows how God does us good, (1.) In preparing it
for us, and that by a long train of causes which depend upon him as the
first cause: The heavens hear the earth; the earth hears the corn, and
wine, and oil; and they hear Jezreel. [Hos
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#021.md), [Hos
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#022.md). He does us good in giving us
rain from heaven - rain for us to drink, for if there were no rain there
would be no springs of water and we should soon die for thirst - rain
for our land to drink, for our meat as well as drink we have from the
rain; in giving us this, he gives us fruitful seasons. If the heavens be
as iron, the earth will soon be as brass, [Lev
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#019.md). This is the river of God which
greatly enriches the earth, and by it God prepares us corn, [Psa
65:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009.md). Of all the common operations
of providence, the heathen chose to form their notion of the supreme God
by that which bespeaks terror, and is proper to strike an awe of him
upon us, and this was the thunder; and therefore they called Jupiter the
thunderer, and represented him with a thunderbolt in his hand; and it
appears by [Psa 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003.md) that this ought
not to be overlooked; but the apostle here, to engage us to worship God,
sets before us his beneficence, that we may have good thoughts of him in
every thing wherein we have to do with him - may love him and delight in
him, as one that does good, does good to us, does good to all, in giving
rain from heaven and fruitful seasons; and if at any time rain be
withheld, or the seasons be unfruitful, we may thank ourselves; it is
our sin that turns away these good things from us which were coming to
us, and stops the current of God's favours. (2.) In giving us the
comforts of it. It is he that fills our hearts with food and gladness.
God is rich in mercy to all ([Rom
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#012).md): he gives us richly all things
to enjoy ([Ti1 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017).md), is not only a
benefactor, but a bountiful one, not only gives us the things we need,
but gives us to enjoy them ([Ecc
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024).md): He fills our hearts with food,
that is, he gives us food to our hearts' content, or according to our
hearts' desire; not merely for necessity, but plenty, dainty, and
variety. Even those nations that had lost the knowledge of him, and
worshipped other gods, yet he filled their houses, filled their mouths,
filled their bellies ([Job 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#018.md); [Psa
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014).md) with good things. The Gentiles
that lived without God in the world, yet lived upon God, which Christ
urges as a reason why we should do good to those that hate us, [Mat
5:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044.md), [Mat
5:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045.md). Those heathen had their hearts
filled with food; this was their felicity and satisfaction, they desired
no more; but these things will not fill the soul ([Eze
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#019).md), nor will those that know how to
value their own souls be satisfied with them; but the apostles put
themselves in as sharers in the divine beneficence. We must all own that
God fills our hearts with food and gladness; not only food, that we may
live, but gladness, that we may live cheerfully; to him we owe it that
we do not all our days eat in sorrow. Note, We must thank God, not only
for our food, but for our gladness - that he gives us leave to be
cheerful, cause to be cheerful, and hearts to be cheerful. And, if our
hearts be filled with food and gladness, they ought to be filled with
love and thankfulness, and enlarged in duty and obedience, [Deu
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#010.md); [Deu
28:47](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#047.md).

Lastly, The success of this prohibition which the apostles gave to the
people ([Act 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#018).md): By these sayings,
with much ado, they restrained the people from doing sacrifice to them,
so strongly were these idolaters set upon their idolatry. It was not
enough for the apostles to refuse to be deified (this would be construed
only a pang of modesty), but they resented it, they showed the people
the evil of it, and all little enough, for they could scarcely restrain
them from it, and some of them were ready to blame the priest, that he
did not go on with his business notwithstanding. We may see here what
gave rise to the pagan idolatry; it was terminating those regards in the
instruments of our comfort which should have passed through them to the
Author. Paul and Barnabas had cured a cripple, and therefore the people
deified them, instead of glorifying God for giving them such power,
which should make us very cautious that we do not give that honour to
another, or take it to ourselves, which is due to God only.

[Acts 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 14:19</span></span>

We have here a further account of the services and sufferings of Paul
and Barnabas.

I. How Paul was stoned and left for dead, but miraculously came to
himself again, [Act 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019.md), [Act
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#020.md). They fell upon Paul rather than
Barnabas, because Paul, being the chief speaker, galled and vexed them
more than Barnabas did. Now observe here, 1. How the people were
incensed against Paul; not by any injury they pretended he had done them
(if they took it for an affront that he would not let them misplace
divine honours upon him, when they considered themselves they would
easily forgive him that wrong), but there came certain Jews from
Antioch, hearing, it is likely, and vexed to hear, what respect was
shown to Paul and Barnabas at Lystra; and they incensed the people
against them, as factious, seditious, dangerous persons, not fit to be
harboured. See how restless the rage of the Jews was against the gospel
of Christ; they could not bear that it should have footing any where. 2.
To what degree they were incensed by these barbarous Jews: they were
irritated to such a degree that the mob rose and stoned Paul, not by a
judicial sentence, but in a popular tumult; they threw stones at him,
with which they knocked him down, and then drew him out of the city, as
one not fit to live in it, or drew him out upon a sledge or in a cart,
to bury him, supposing he had been dead. So strong is the bias of the
corrupt and carnal heart to that which is evil, even in contrary
extremes, that, as it is with great difficulty that men are restrained
from evil on one side, so it is with great ease that they are persuaded
to evil on the other side. See how fickle and mutable the minds of
carnal worldly people are, that do not know and consider things. Those
that but the other day would have treated the apostles as more than men
now treat them as worse than brutes, as the worst of men, as the worst
of male-factors. Today Hosanna, tomorrow Crucify; today sacrificed to,
tomorrow sacrificed. We have an instance of a change the other way, ch.
28. This man is a murderer, [Act 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#004.md);
no doubt he is a god, [Act 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#006.md).
Popular breath turns like the wind. If Paul would have been Mercury, he
might have been enthroned, nay, he might have been enshrined; but, if he
will be a faithful minister of Christ, he shall be stoned, and thrown
out of the city. Thus those who easily submit to strong delusions hate
to receive the truth in the love of it. 3. How he was delivered by the
power of God: When he was drawn out of the city, the disciples stood
round about him, [Act 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#020.md). It seems
there were some here at Lystra that became disciples, that found the
mean between deifying the apostles and rejecting them; and even these
new converts had courage to own Paul when he was thus run down, though
they had reason enough to fear that the same that stoned him would stone
them for owning him. They stood round about him, as a guard to him
against the further outrage of the people - stood about him to see
whether he were alive or dead; and all of a sudden he rose up. Though he
was not dead, yet he was ill crushed and bruised, no doubt, and fainted
away; he was in a deliquium, so that it was not without a miracle that
he came so soon to himself, and was so well as to be able to go into the
city. Note, God's faithful servants, though they may be brought within a
step of death, and may be looked upon as dead both by friends and
enemies, shall not die as long as he has work for them to do. They are
cast down, but not destroyed, [Co2
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#009.md).

II\. How they went on with their work, notwithstanding the opposition
they met with. All the stones they threw at Paul could not beat him off
from his work: They drew him out of the city ([Act
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019).md), but, as one that set them at
defiance, he came into the city again, to show that he did not fear
them; none even of these things move him. However, their being
persecuted here is a known indication to them to seek for opportunities
of usefulness elsewhere, and therefore for the present they quit Lystra.

1\. They went to break up and sow fresh ground at Derbe. Thither the
next day Paul and Barnabas departed, a city not far off; there they
preached the gospel, there they taught many, [Act
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#021.md). And it should seem that Timothy
was of that city, and was one of the disciples that now attended Paul,
had met him at Antioch and accompanied him in all this circuit; for,
with reference to this story, Paul tells him how fully he had known the
afflictions he endured at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra, [Ti2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#010.md), [Ti2
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#011.md). Nothing is recorded that
happened at Derbe.

2\. They returned, and went over their work again, watering what they
had sown; and, having staid as long as they thought fit at Derbe, they
came back to Lystra, to Iconium, and Antioch, the cities where they had
preached, [Act 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#021.md). Now, as we have
had a very instructive account of the methods they took in laying the
foundation, and beginning the good work, so here we have the like of
their building upon that foundation, and carrying on that good work. Let
us see what they did,

(1.) They confirmed the souls of the disciples; that is, they inculcated
that upon them which was proper to confirm them, [Act
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022.md). Young converts are apt to
waver, and a little thing shocks them. Their old acquaintances beg they
will not leave them. Those that they look upon to be wiser than
themselves set before them the absurdity, indecency, and danger, of a
change. They were allured, by the prospect of preferment, to stick to
the traditions of their fathers; they are frightened with the danger of
swimming against the stream. All this tempts them to think of making a
retreat in time; but the apostles come and tell them that this is the
true grace of God wherein they stand, and therefore they must stand to
it that there is no danger like that of losing their part in Christ, no
advantage like that of keeping their hold of him; that, whatever their
trials may be, they shall have strength from Christ to pass through
them; and, whatever their losses may be, they shall be abundantly
recompensed. And this confirms the souls of the disciples; it fortifies
their pious resolutions, in the strength of Christ, to adhere to Christ
whatever it may cost them. Note, \[1.\] Those that are converted need to
be confirmed; those that are planted need to be rooted. Ministers' work
is to establish saints as well as to awaken sinners. Non minor est
virtus quam quoerere parta tueri - To retain is sometimes as difficult
as to acquire. Those that were instructed in the truth must know the
certainty of the things in which they have been instructed; and those
that are resolved must be fixed in their resolutions. \[2.\] True
confirmation is confirmation of the soul; it is not binding the body by
severe penalties on apostates, but binding the soul. The best ministers
can do this only by pressing those things which are proper to bind the
soul; it is the grace of God, and nothing less, that can effectually
confirm the souls of the disciples, and prevent their apostasy.

(2.) They exhorted them to continue in the faith; or, as it may be read,
they encouraged them. They told them it was both their duty and interest
to persevere; to abide in the belief of Christ's being the Son of God,
and the Saviour of the world. Note, Those that are in the faith are
concerned to continue in the faith, notwithstanding all the temptations
they may be under to desert it, from the smiles or frowns of this world.
And it is requisite that they should often be exhorted to do so. Those
that are continually surrounded with temptations to apostasy have need
to be continually attended with pressing exhortations to perseverance.

(3.) That which they insisted most upon was that we must through much
tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. Not only they must, but we
must; it must be counted upon that all who will go to heaven must expect
tribulation and persecution in their way thither. But is this the way to
confirm the souls of the disciples, and to engage them to continue in
the faith? One would think it would rather shock them, and make them
weary. No, as the matter is fairly stated and taken entire, it will help
to confirm them, and fix them for Christ. It is true they will meet with
tribulation, with much tribulation; that is the worst of it: but then,
\[1.\] It is so appointed. They must undergo it, there is no remedy, the
matter is already fixed, and cannot be altered. He that has the
sovereign disposal of us has determined it to be our lot that all that
will live godly in Christ Jesus should suffer persecution; and he that
has the sovereign command over us has determined this to be our duty,
that all that will be Christ's disciples must take up their cross. When
we gave up our names to Jesus Christ it was what we agreed to; when we
sat down and counted the cost, if we reckoned aright, it was what we
counted upon; so that if tribulation and persecution arise because of
the word it is but what we had notice of before, it must be so: he
performeth the thing that is appointed for us. The matter is fixed
unalterably; and shall the rock be for us removed out of its place?
\[2.\] It is the lot of the leaders in Christ's army, as well as of the
soldiers. It is not only you, but we, that (if it be thought a hardship)
are subject to it; therefore, as your own sufferings must not be a
stumbling-block to you, so neither must ours; see [Th1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#003.md). Let none be moved by our
afflictions, for you yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto. As
Christ did not put the apostles upon any harder service than what he
underwent before them, so neither did the apostles put the ordinary
Christians. \[3.\] It is true we must count upon much tribulation, but
this is encouraging, that we shall get through it; we shall not be lost
and perish in it. It is a Red Sea, but the Lord has opened a way through
it, for the redeemed of the Lord to pass over. We must go down to
trouble, but we shall come up again. \[4.\] We shall not only get
through it, but get through it into the kingdom of God; and the joy and
glory of the end will make abundant amends for all the difficulties and
hardships we may meet with in the way. It is true we must go by the
cross, but it is as true that if we keep in the way, and do not turn
aside nor turn back, we shall go to the crown, and the believing
prospect of this will make the tribulation easy and pleasant.

(4.) They ordained them elders, or presbyters, in every church. Now at
this second visit they settled them in some order, formed them into
religious societies under the guidance of a settled ministry, and
settled that distinction between those that are taught in the word and
those that teach. \[1.\] Every church had its governors or presidents,
whose office it was to pray with the members of the church, and to
preach to them in their solemn assemblies, to administer all gospel
ordinances to them, and to take the oversight of them, to instruct the
ignorant, warn the unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, and convince
gainsayers. It is requisite that every particular church should have one
or more such to preside in it. \[2.\] Those governors were then elders,
that had in their qualification the wisdom and gravity of seniors, and
had in their commission the authority and command of seniors: not to
make new laws (this is the prerogative of the Prince, the great
Lawgiver; the government of the church is an absolute monarchy, and the
legislative power entirely in Christ), but to see to the observance and
execution of the laws Christ has made; and so far they are to be obeyed
and submitted to. \[3.\] These elders were ordained. The qualifications
of such as were proposed or proposed themselves (whether the apostles or
the people put them up) were judged of by the apostles, as most fit to
judge; and they, having devoted themselves, were solemnly set apart to
the work of the ministry, and bound to it. \[4.\] These elders were
ordained to them, to the disciples, to their service, for their good.
Those that are in the faith have need to be built up in it, and have
need of the elders' help therein - the pastors and teachers, who are to
edify the body of Christ.

(5.) By prayer joined with fasting they commended them to the Lord, to
the Lord Jesus, on whom they believed. Note, \[1.\] Even when persons
are brought to believe, and that sincerely, yet ministers' care
concerning them is not over; there is need of watching over them still,
instructing and admonishing them still; there is still that lacking in
their faith which needs to be perfected. \[2.\] The ministers that take
most care of those that believe must after all commend them to the Lord,
and put them under the protection and guidance of his grace: Lord, keep
them through thine own name. To his custody they must commit themselves,
and their ministers must commit them. \[3.\] It is by prayer that they
must be commended to the Lord. Christ, in his prayer (Jn. 17), commended
his disciples to his Father: Thine they were, and thou gavest them to
me. Father, keep them. \[4.\] It is a great encouragement to us, in
commending the disciples to the Lord, that we can say, "It is he in whom
they believed; we commit to him those who have committed themselves to
him, and who know they have believed in one who is able to keep what
they and we have committed to him against that day," [Ti2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012.md). \[5.\] It is good to join
fasting with prayer, in token of our humiliation for sin, and in order
to add vigour to our prayers. \[6.\] When we are parting with our
friends, the best farewell is to commend them to the Lord, and to leave
them with him.

3\. They went on preaching the gospel in other places where they had
been, but, as it should seem had not made so many converts as that now
at their return they could form them into churches; therefore thither
they came to pursue and carry on conversion-work. From Antioch they
passed through Pisidia, the province in which that Antioch stood; thence
they came into the province of Pamphylia, the head-city of which was
Perga, where they had been before ([Act
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#013).md), and came thither again to
preach the word ([Act 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#025).md), making a
second offer, to see if they were now better disposed than they were
before to receive the gospel. What success they had there we are not
told, but that thence they went down to Attalia, a city of Pamphylia, on
the sea-coast. They staid not long at a place, but wherever they came
endeavoured to lay a foundation which might afterwards be built upon,
and to sow the seeds which would in time produce a great increase. Now
Christ's parables were explained, in which he compared the kingdom of
heaven to a little leaven, which in time leavened the whole lump - to a
grain of mustard-seed, which, though very inconsiderable at first, grew
to a great tree - and to the seed which a man sowed in his ground, and
it sprung up he knew not how.

III\. How they at length came back to Antioch in Syria, whence they had
been sent forth upon this expedition. From Attalia they came by sea to
Antioch, [Act 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#026.md). And we are here
told,

1\. Why they came thither: because thence they had been recommended to
the grace of God, and such a value did they put upon a solemn
recommendation to the grace of God, though they had themselves a great
interest in heaven, that they never thought they could show respect
enough to those who had so recommended them. The brethren having
recommended them to the grace of God, for the work which they fulfilled,
now that they had fulfilled it they thought they owed them an account of
it, that they might help them by their praises, as they had been helped
by their prayers.

2\. What account they gave them of their negociation ([Act
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#027).md): They gathered the church
together. It is probable that there were more Christians at Antioch than
ordinarily met, or could meet, in one place, but on this occasion they
called together the leading men of them; as the heads of the tribes are
often called the congregation of Israel, so the ministers and principal
members of the church at Antioch are called the church. Or perhaps as
many of the people as the place would hold came together on this
occasion. Or some met at one time, or in one place, and others at
another. But when they had called them together, they gave them an
account of two things - (1.) Of the tokens they had had of the divine
presence with them in their labours: They rehearsed all that God had
done with them. They did not tell what they had done (this would have
savoured of vain-glory), but what God had done with them and by them.
Note, The praise of all the little good we do at any time must be
ascribed to God; for it is he that not only worketh in us both to will
and to do, but then worketh with us to make what we do successful. God's
grace can do any thing without ministers' preaching; but ministers'
preaching, even Paul's, can do nothing without God's grace; and the
operations of that grace must be acknowledged in the efficacy of the
word. (2.) Of the fruit of their labours among the heathen. They told
how God had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles; had not only
ordered them to be invited to the gospel feast, but had inclined the
hearts of many of them to accept the invitation. Note, \[1.\] There is
no entering into the kingdom of Christ but by the door of faith; we must
firmly believe in Christ, or we have no part in him. \[2.\] It is God
that opens the door of faith, that opens to us the truths we are to
believe, opens our hearts to receive them, and makes this a wide door,
and an effectual, into the church of Christ. \[3.\] We have reason to be
thankful that God has opened the door of faith to the Gentiles, has both
sent them his gospel, which is made known to all nations for the
obedience of faith ([Rom 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#026).md), and
has also given them hearts to entertain the gospel. Thus the gospel was
spread, and it shone more and more, and none was able to shut this door
which God had opened; not all the powers of hell and earth.

3\. How they disposed of themselves for the present: There they abode a
long time with the disciples ([Act
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#028).md), longer than perhaps at first
they intended, not because they feared their enemies, but because they
loved their friends, and were loth to part from them.
