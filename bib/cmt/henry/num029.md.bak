### [Numbers Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

This chapter appoints the offerings that were to be made by fire unto
the Lord in the three great solemnities of the seventh month. I. In the
feast of trumpets on the first day of that month ([Num
29:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001).md). II. In the day of atonement
on the tenth day ([Num 29:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#007).md). III.
In the feast of tabernacles on the fifteenth day and the seven days
following (v. 12-38). And then the conclusion of these ordinances ([Num
29:39](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#039.md), [Num
29:40](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#040).md).

[Numbers 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 29:1</span></span>

There were more sacred solemnities in the seventh month than in any
other month of the year, not only because it had been the first month
till the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt (which, falling in the month
Abib, occasioned that to be thenceforth made the beginning of the months
in all ecclesiastical computations), but because still it continued the
first month in the civil reckonings of the jubilees and years of
release, and also because it was the time of vacation between harvest
and seedtime, when they had most leisure to attend the sanctuary, which
intimates that, though God will dispense with sacrifices in
consideration of works of necessity and mercy, yet the more leisure we
have from the pressing occasions of this life the more time we should
spend in the immediate service of God. 1. We have here the appointment
of the sacrifices that were to be offered on the first day of the month,
the day of blowing the trumpets, which was a preparative for the two
great solemnities of holy mourning on the day of atonement and of holy
joy in the feast of tabernacles. The intention of divine institutions is
well answered when one religious service helps to fit us for another and
all for heaven. The blowing of the trumpets was appointed, [Lev
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#024.md). Here the people are directed
what sacrifices to offer on that day, of which there was not then any
mention made. Note, Those who would know the mind of God in the
scripture must compare one part of the scripture with another, and put
those parts together that have reference to the same thing, for the
latter discoveries of divine light explain what was dark and supply what
was defective in the former, that the man of God may be perfect. The
sacrifices then to be offered are particularly ordered here ([Num
29:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#002).md), and care taken that these
should not supersede the daily oblation and that of the new moon. It is
hereby intimated that we must not seek occasions to abate our zeal in
God's service, nor be glad of an excuse to omit a good duty, but rather
rejoice in an opportunity of accumulating and doing more than ordinary
in religion. If we perform family-worship, we must not think that this
will excuse us from our secret devotions; nor that on the days we go to
church we need not worship God alone and with our families; but we
should always abound in the work of the Lord. 2. On the day of
atonement. Besides all the services of that day, which we had the
institution of, Lev. 16, and which, one would think, required trouble
and charge enough, here are burnt-offerings ordered to be offered, [Num
29:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#008.md). For in our faith and
repentance, those two great gospel graces which were signified by that
day's performances, we must have an eye to the glory and honour of God,
which was purely intended in the burnt-offerings; there was likewise to
be a kid of the goats for a sin-offering, besides the great sin-offering
of atonement ([Num 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#011).md), which
intimates that there are so many defects and faults, even in the
exercises and expressions of our repentance, that we have need of an
interest in a sacrifice to expiate the guilt even of that part of our
holy things. Though we must not repent that we have repented, yet we
must repent that we have not repented better. It likewise intimated the
imperfection of the legal sacrifices, and their insufficiency to take
away sin, that on the very day the sin-offering of atonement was
offered, yet there must be another sin-offering. But what the law could
not do, in that it was weak, that Christ has done.

[Numbers 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 29:12</span></span>

Soon after the day of atonement, that day in which men were to afflict
their souls, followed the feast of tabernacles, in which they were to
rejoice before the Lord; for those that sow in tears shall soon reap in
joy. To the former laws about this feast, which we had, [Lev
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034.md), etc., here are added directions
about the offerings by fire, which they were to offer unto the Lord
during the seven days of that feast, [Lev
23:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#036.md). Observe here, 1. Their days of
rejoicing were to be days of sacrifices. A disposition to be cheerful
does us no harm, nor is any bad symptom, when it is so far from
unfitting us for the duties of God's immediate service that it
encourages and enlarges our hearts in them. 2. All the days of their
dwelling in booths they must offer sacrifices. While we are here in a
tabernacle-state, it is our interest as well as duty constantly to keep
up communion with God; nor will the unsettledness of our outward
condition excuse us in our neglect of the duties of God's worship. 3.
The sacrifices for each of the seven days, though differing in nothing
but the number of the bullocks, are severally and particularly
appointed, which yet is no vain repetition; for God would thus teach
them to be very exact in those observances, and to keep an eye of faith
fixed upon the institution in every day's work. It likewise intimates
that the repetition of the same services, if performed with an upright
heart, and with a continued fire of pious and devout affection, is no
weariness to God, and therefore we ought not to snuff at it, or to say,
Behold, what a weariness it is to us! 4. The number of bullocks (which
were the most costly part of the sacrifice) decreased every day. On the
first day of the feast they were to offer thirteen, on the second day
but twelve, on the third day eleven, etc. So that on the seventh they
offered seven; and the last day, though it was the great day of the
feast, and celebrated with a holy convocation, yet they were to offer
but one bullock; and, whereas on all the other days they offered two
rams and fourteen lambs, on this they offered but one ram and seven
lambs. Such was the will of the Law-maker, and that is reason enough for
the law. Some suggest that God herein considered the infirmity of the
flesh, which is apt to grudge the charge and expense of religion; it is
therefore ordered to grow less and less, that they might not complain as
if God had made them to serve with an offering, [Isa
43:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#023.md). Or it is hereby intimated to
them that the legal dispensation should wax old, and vanish away at
last; and the multitude of their sacrifices should end in one great
sacrifice, infinitely more worthy than all of them. It was on the last
day of the feast, after all these sacrifices had been ordered, that our
Lord Jesus stood and cried to those who still thirsted after
righteousness (being sensible of the insufficiency of these sacrifices
to justify them) to come unto him and drink, [Joh
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037.md). 5. The meat-offerings and
drink-offerings attended all the sacrifices, according to their number,
after the manner. Be there ever so much flesh, it is no feast without
bread and drink, therefore these must never be omitted at God's altar,
which was his table. We must not think that doing much in religion will
be accepted if we do not do it well, and after the manner that God has
appointed. 6. Every day there must be a sin-offering presented, as we
observed in the other feasts. Our burnt-offerings of praise cannot be
accepted of God unless we have an interest in the great sacrifice of
propitiation which Christ offered when for us he made himself a
sin-offering. 7. Even when all these sacrifices were offered, yet the
continual burnt-offering must not be omitted either morning or evening,
but each day this must be offered first in the morning and last in the
evening. No extraordinary services should jostle out our stated
devotions. 8. Though all these sacrifices were required to be presented
by the body of the congregation, at the common charge, yet, besides
these, particular persons were to glorify God with their vows and their
free-will offerings, [Num 29:39](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#039.md). When
God commanded that this they must do, he left room for the generosity of
their devotion, a great deal more they might do, not inventing other
worships, but abounding in these, as [Ch2
30:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#023.md), [Ch2
30:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#024.md). Large directions had been given
in Leviticus concerning the offerings of all sorts that should be
brought by particular persons according to the providences of God
concerning them and the graces of God in them. Though every Israelite
had an interest in these common sacrifices, yet he must not think that
these will serve instead of his vows and his free-will offerings. Thus
our ministers' praying with us and for us will not excuse us from
praying for ourselves.
