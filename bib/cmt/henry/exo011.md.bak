### [Exodus Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 11:0</span></span>

Pharaoh had told Moses to get out of his presence ([Exo
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#028).md), and Moses had promised this
should be the last time he would trouble him, yet he resolves to say out
what he had to say, before he left him; accordingly, we have in this
chapter, I. The instructions God had given to Moses, which he was now to
pursue ([Exo 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001.md), [Exo
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#002).md), together with the interest
Israel and Moses had in the esteem of the Egyptians ([Exo
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#003).md). II. The last message Moses
delivered to Pharaoh, concerning the death of the firstborn ([Exo
11:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#004).md). III. A repetition of the
prediction of Pharaoh's hardening his heart ([Exo
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#009).md), and the event answering to it
([Exo 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#010).md).

[Exodus 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 11:1</span></span>

Here is, I. The high favour Moses and Israel were in with God. 1. Moses
was a favourite of Heaven, for God will not hide from him the thing he
will do. God not only makes him his messenger to deliver his errands,
but communicates to him his purpose (as the man of his counsel) that he
would bring one plague more, and but one, upon Pharaoh, by which he
would complete the deliverance of Israel, [Exo
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001.md). Moses longed to see an end of
this dreadful work, to see Egypt no more plagued and Israel no more
oppressed: "Well," says God, "now it is near an end; the warfare shall
shortly be accomplished, the point gained; Pharaoh shall be forced to
own himself conquered, and to give up the cause." After all the rest of
the plagues, God says, I will bring one more. Thus, after all the
judgments executed upon sinners in this world, still there is one more
reserved to be brought on them in the other world, which will completely
humble those whom nothing else would humble. 2. The Israelites were
favourites of Heaven; for God himself espouses their injured cause, and
takes care to see them paid for all their pains in serving the
Egyptians. This was the last day of their servitude; they were about to
go away, and their masters, who had abused them in their work, would not
have defrauded them of their wages, and have sent them away empty; while
the poor Israelites were so fond of liberty that they would be satisfied
with that, without pay, and would rejoice to get that upon any terms:
but he that executeth righteousness and judgment for the oppressed
provided that the labourers should not lose their hire, and ordered them
to demand it now at their departure ([Exo
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#002).md), in jewels of silver and jewels
of gold, to prepare for which God, by the plagues, had now made the
Egyptians as willing to part with them upon any terms as, before, the
Egyptians, by their severities, had made them willing to go upon any
terms. Though the patient Israelites were content to lose their wages,
yet God would not let them go without them. Note, One way or other, God
will give redress to the injured, who in a humble silence commit their
cause to him; and he will see to it that none be losers at last by their
patient suffering any more than by their services.

II\. The high favour Moses and Israel were in with the Egyptians, [Exo
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#003.md). 1. Even the people that has been
hated and despised now came to be respected; the wonders wrought on
their behalf put an honour upon them and made them considerable. How
great do they become for whom God thus fights! Thus the Lord gave them
favour in the sight of the Egyptians, by making it appear how much he
favoured them: he also changed the spirit of the Egyptians towards them,
and made them to be pitied of their oppressors, [Psa
106:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#046.md). 2. The man Moses was very
great. How could it be otherwise when they saw what power he was clothed
with, and what wonders were wrought by his hand? Thus the apostles,
though otherwise despicable men, came to be magnified, [Act
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#013.md). Those that honour God he will
honour; and with respect to those that approve themselves faithful to
him, how meanly soever they may pass through this world, there is a day
coming when they will look great, very great, in the eyes of all the
world, even theirs who now look upon them with the utmost contempt.
Observe, Though Pharaoh hated Moses, there were those of Pharaoh's
servants that respected him. Thus in Caesar's household, even Nero's,
there were some that had an esteem for blessed Paul, [Phi
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#013.md).

[Exodus 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 11:4</span></span>

Warning is here given to Pharaoh of the last and conquering plague which
was now to be inflicted. This was the death of all the first-born in
Egypt at once, which had been first threatened ([Exo
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#023.md), I will slay thy son, thy
first-born), but is last executed; less judgments were tried, which, if
they had done the work would have prevented this. See how slow God is to
wrath, and how willing to be met with in the way of his judgments, and
to have his anger turned away, and particularly how precious the lives
of men are in his eyes: if the death of their cattle had humbled and
reformed them, their children would have been spared; but, if men will
not improve the gradual advances of divine judgments, they must thank
themselves if they find, in the issue, that the worst was reserved for
the last. 1. The plague itself is here particularly foretold, [Exo
11:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#004.md). The time is fixed - about
midnight, the very next midnight, the dead time of the night; when they
were all asleep, all their first-born should sleep the sleep of death,
not silently and insensibly, so as not to be discovered till morning,
but so as to rouse the families at midnight to stand by and see them
die. The extent of this plague is described, [Exo
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#005.md). The prince that was to succeed
in the throne was not too high to be reached by it, nor were the slaves
at the mill too low to be taken notice of. Moses and Aaron were not
ordered to summon this plague; no I will go out, saith the Lord, [Exo
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#004.md). It is a fearful thing to fall
into the hands of the living God; what is hell but this? 2. The special
protection which the children of Israel should be under, and the
manifest difference that should be put between them and the Egyptians.
While angels drew their swords against the Egyptians, there should not
so much as a dog bark at any of the children of Israel, [Exo
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#007.md). An earnest was hereby given of
the difference which shall be put in the great day between God's people
and his enemies: did men know what a difference God puts, and will put
to eternity, between those that serve him and those that serve him not,
religion would not seem to them such an indifferent thing as they make
it, nor would they act in it with so much indifference as they do. 3.
The humble submission which Pharaoh's servants should make to Moses, and
how submissively they should request him to go ([Exo
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#008).md): They shall come down, and bow
themselves. Note, The proud enemies of God and his Israel shall be made
to fall under at last ([Rev 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#009).md), and
shall be found liars to them, [Deu
33:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029.md). When Moses had thus delivered
his message, it is said, He went out from Pharaoh in a great anger,
though he was the meekest of all the men of the earth. Probably he
expected that the very threatening of the death of the firstborn would
have induced Pharaoh to comply, especially as Pharaoh had complied so
far already, and had seen how exactly all Moses's predictions hitherto
were fulfilled. But it had not that effect; his proud heart would not
yield, no, not to save all the firstborn of his kingdom: no marvel that
men are not deterred from vicious courses by the prospects given them of
eternal misery in the other world, when the imminent peril they run of
the loss of all that is dear to them in this world will not frighten
them. Moses, hereupon, was provoked to a holy indignation, being grieved
(as our Saviour afterwards) for the hardness of his heart, [Mar
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#005.md). Note, It is a great vexation to
the spirits of good ministers to see people deaf to all the fair
warnings given them, and running headlong upon ruin, notwithstanding all
the kind methods taken to prevent it. Thus Ezekiel went in the
bitterness of his spirit ([Eze 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#014).md),
because God had told him that the house of Israel would not hearken to
him, [Exo 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#007.md). To be angry at nothing
but sin is the way not to sin in anger. Moses, having thus adverted to
the disturbance which Pharaoh's obstinacy gave him, (1.) Reflects upon
the previous notice God had given him of this ([Exo
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#009).md): The Lord said unto Moses,
Pharaoh shall not hearken to you. The scripture has foretold the
incredulity of those who should hear the gospel, that it might not be a
surprise nor stumbling-block to us, [Joh
12:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#037.md), [Joh
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#038.md); [Rom
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#016.md). Let us think never the worse of
the gospel of Christ for the slights men generally put upon it, for we
were told before what cold entertainment it would meet with. (2.) He
recapitulates all he had said before to this purport ([Exo
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#010).md), that Moses did all these
wonders, as they are here related, before Pharaoh (he himself was an
eye-witness of them), and yet he could not prevail, which was a certain
sign that God himself had, in a way of righteous judgment, hardened his
heart. Thus the Jews' rejection of the gospel of Christ was so gross an
absurdity that it might easily be inferred from it that God had given
them the spirit of slumber, [Rom 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#008.md).
