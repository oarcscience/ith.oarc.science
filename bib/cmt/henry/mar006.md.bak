### [Mark Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#001.md)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 6:0</span></span>

A great variety of observable passages we have, in this chapter,
concerning our Lord Jesus, the substance of all which we had before in
Matthew, but divers circumstances we have, which we did not there meet
with. Here is, I. Christ contemned by his countrymen, because he was one
of them, and they knew, or thought they knew, his original ([Mar
6:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#001).md). II. The just power he gave his
apostles over unclean spirits, and an account given of their negotiation
([Mar 6:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#007).md). III. A strange notion
which Herod and others had of Christ, upon which occasion we have the
story of the martyrdom of John Baptist (v. 14-29). IV. Christ's
retirement into a desert place with his disciples; the crowds that
followed him thither to receive instruction from him; and his feeding
five thousand of them with five loaves and two fishes ([Mar
6:30-44](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#030).md). V. Christ's walking upon the
sea to his disciples, and the abundance of cures he wrought on the other
side of the water ([Mar 6:45-56](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#045).md).

[Mark 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 6:1</span></span>

Here, I. Christ makes a visit to his own country, the place not of his
birth, but of his education; that was Nazareth; where his relations
were. He had been in danger of his life among them ([Luk
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#029).md), and yet he came among them
again; so strangely doth he wait to be gracious, and seek the salvation
of his enemies. Whither he went, though it was into danger, his
disciples followed him ([Mar 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#001).md); for
they had left all, to follow him whithersoever he went.

II\. There he preached in their synagogue, on the sabbath day, [Mar
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#002.md). It seems, there was not such
flocking to him there as in other places, so that he had no opportunity
of preaching till they came together on the sabbath day; and then he
expounded a portion of scripture with great clearness. In religious
assemblies, on sabbath days, the word of God is to be preached according
to Christ's example. We give glory to God by receiving instruction from
him.

III\. They could not but own that which was very honourable concerning
him. 1. That he spoke with great wisdom, and that this wisdom was given
to him, for they knew he had no learned education. 2. That he did mighty
works, did them with his own hands, for the confirming of the doctrine
he taught. They acknowledged the two great proofs of the divine original
of his gospel - the divine wisdom that appeared in the contrivance of
it, and the divine power that was exerted for the ratifying and
recommending of it; and yet, though they could not deny the premises,
they would not admit the conclusion.

IV\. They studied to disparage him, and to raise prejudices in the minds
of people against him, notwithstanding. All this wisdom, and all these
mighty works, shall be of no account, because he had a home-education,
had never travelled, nor been at any university, or bred up at the feet
of any of their doctors ([Mar 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#003).md); Is
not this the Carpenter? In Matthew, they upbraid him with being the
carpenter's son, his supposed father Joseph being of that trade. But, it
seems, they could say further, Is not this the Carpenter? our Lord
Jesus, it is probable, employing himself in that business with his
father, before he entered upon his public ministry, at least, sometimes
in journey-work. 1. He would thus humble himself, and make himself of no
reputation, as one that had taken upon him the form of a servant, and
came to minister. Thus low did our Redeemer stoop, when he came to
redeem us out of our low estate. 2. He would thus teach us to abhor
idleness, and to find ourselves something to do in this world; and
rather to take up with mean and laborious employments, and such as no
more is to be got by than a bare livelihood, than indulge ourselves in
sloth. Nothing is more pernicious for young people than to get a habit
of sauntering. The Jews had a good rule for this - that their young men
who were designed for scholars, were yet bred up to some trade, as Paul
was a tent-maker, that they might have some business to fill up their
time with, and, if need were, to get their bread with. 3. He would thus
put an honour upon despised mechanics, and encourage those who eat the
labour of their hands, though great men look upon them with contempt.

Another thing they upbraided him with, was, the meanness of his
relations; "He is the son of Mary; his brethren and sisters are here
with us; we know his family and kindred;" and therefore, though they
were astonished at his doctrine ([Mar
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#002).md), yet they were offended at his
person ([Mar 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#003).md), were prejudiced
against him, and looked upon him with contempt; and for that reason
would not receive his doctrine, though ever so well recommended. May we
think that if they had not known his pedigree, but he had dropped among
them from the clouds, without father, without mother, and without
descent, they would have entertained him with any more respect? Truly,
no; for in Judea, where this was not know, that was made an objection
against him ([Joh 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#029).md); As for this
fellow, we know not from whence he is. Obstinate unbelief will never
want excuses.

V. Let us see how Christ bore this contempt.

1\. He partly excused it, as a common thing, and what might be expected,
though not reasonably or justly ([Mar
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#004).md); A prophet is not despised any
where but in his own country. Some exceptions there may be to this rule;
doubtless many have got over this prejudice, but ordinarily it holds
good, that ministers are seldom so acceptable and successful in their
own country as among strangers; familiarity in the younger years breeds
a contempt, the advancement of one that was an inferior begets envy, and
men will hardly set those among the guides of their souls whose fathers
they were ready to set with the dogs of their flock; in such a case
therefore it must not be thought hard, it is common treatment, it was
Christ's, and wisdom is profitable to direct to other soil.

2\. He did some good among them, notwithstanding the slights they put
upon him, for he is kind even to the evil and unthankful; He laid his
hands upon a few sick folks, and healed them. Note, It is generous, and
becoming the followers of Christ, to content themselves with the
pleasure and satisfaction of doing good, though they be unjustly denied
the praise of it.

3\. Yet he could there do no such mighty works, at least not so many, as
in other places, because of the unbelief that prevailed among the
people, by reason of the prejudices which their leaders instilled into
them against Christ, [Mar 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#005.md). It is a
strange expression, as if unbelief tied the hands of omnipotence itself;
he would have done as many miracles there as he had done elsewhere, but
he could not, because people would not make application to him, nor sue
for his favours; he could have wrought them, but they forfeited the
honour of having them wrought for them. Note, By unbelief and contempt
of Christ men stop the current of his favours to them, and put a bar in
their own door.

4\. He marvelled because of their unbelief, [Mar
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#006.md). We never find Christ wondering
but at the faith of the Gentiles that were strangers, as the centurion
([Mat 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#010).md), and the woman of Samaria,
and at the unbelief of Jews that were his own countrymen. Note, The
unbelief of those that enjoy the means of grace, is a most amazing
thing.

5\. He went round about the village, teaching. If we cannot do good
where we would, we must do it where we can, and be glad if we may have
any opportunity, though but in the villages, of serving Christ and
souls. Sometimes the gospel of Christ finds better entertainment in the
country villages, where there is less wealth, and pomp, and mirth, and
subtlety, than in the populous cities.

[Mark 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 6:7</span></span>

Here is, I. The commission given to the twelve apostles, to preach and
work miracles; it is the same which we had more largely, Mt. 10. Mark
doth not name them here, as Matthew doth, because he had named them
before, when they were first called into fellowship with him, [Mar
3:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#016.md). Hitherto they had been
conversant with Christ, and had set at his feet, had heard his doctrine,
and seen his miracles; and now he determines to make some use of them;
they had received, that they might give, had learned, that they might
teach; and therefore now he began to send them forth. They must not
always be studying in the academy, to get knowledge, but they must
preach in the country, to do good with the knowledge they have got.
Though they were not as yet so well accomplished as they were to be,
yet, according to their present ability and capacity, they must be set
to work, and make further improvements afterward. Now observe here,

1\. That Christ sent them forth by two and two; this Mark takes notice
of. They went two and two to a place, that out of the mouth of two
witnesses every word might be established; and that they might be
company for one another when they were among strangers, and might
strengthen the hands, and encourage the hearts, one of another; might
help one another if any thing should be amiss, and keep one another in
countenance. Every common soldier has his comrade; and it is an approved
maxim, Two are better than one. Christ would thus teach his ministers to
associate, and both lend and borrow help.

2\. That he gave them power over unclean spirits. He commissioned them
to attack the devil's kingdom, and empowered them, as a specimen of
their breaking his interest in the souls of men by their doctrine, to
cast him out of the bodies of those that were possessed. Dr. Lightfoot
suggests, that they cured diseases, and cast out devils, by the Spirit,
but preached that only which they had learned from the mouth of Christ.

3\. That he commanded them not to take provisions along with them,
neither victuals nor money, that they might appear, wherever they came,
to be poor men, men not of this world, and therefore might with the
better grace call people off from it to another world. When afterward he
bid them take purse and scrip ([Luk
22:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#036).md), that did not intimate (as Dr.
Lightfoot observes) that his care of them was abated from what it had
been; but that they should meet with worse times and worse entertainment
than they met with at their first mission. In Matthew and Luke they are
forbidden to take staves with them, that is, fighting staves; but here
in Mark they are bid to take nothing save a staff only, that is, a
walking staff, such as pilgrims carried. They must not put on shoes, but
sandals only, which were only the soles of shoes tied under their feet,
or like pumps, or slippers; they must go in the readiest plainest dress
they could, and must not so much as have two coats; for their stay
abroad would be short, they must return before winter, and what they
wanted, those they preached to would cheerfully accommodate them with.

4\. He directed them, whatever city they came to, to make that house
their head-quarters, which happened to be their first quarters ([Mar
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#010).md); "There abide, till ye depart
from that place. And since ye know ye come on an errand sufficient to
make you welcome, have such charity for your friends that first invited
you, as to believe they do not think you burthensome."

5\. He pronounces a very heavy doom upon those that rejected the gospel
they preached ([Mar 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#011).md); "Whosoever
shall not receive you, or will not so much as hear you, depart thence
(if one will not, another will), and shake off the dust under your feet,
for a testimony against them. Let them know that they have had a fair
offer of life and happiness made them, witness that dust; but that,
since they have refused it, they cannot expect ever to have another; let
them take up with their own dust, for so shall their doom be." That
dust, like the dust of Egypt ([Exo
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#009).md), shall turn into a plague to
them; and their condemnation in the great day, will be more intolerable
than that of Sodom: for the angels were sent to Sodom, and were abused
there; yet that would not bring on so great a guilt and so great a ruin
as the contempt and abuse of the apostles of Christ, who bring with them
the offers of gospel grace.

II\. The apostles' conduct in pursuance of their commission. Though they
were conscious to themselves of great weakness, and expected no secular
advantage by it, yet, in obedience to their Master's order, and in
dependence upon his strength, they went out as Abraham, not knowing
whither they went. Observe here,

1\. The doctrine they preached; They preached that men should repent
([Mar 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#012).md); that they should change
their minds, and reform their lives, in consideration of the near
approach of the kingdom of the Messiah. Note, The great design of the
gospel preachers, and the great tendency of gospel preaching, should be,
to bring people to repentance, to a new heart and a new way. They did
not amuse people with curious speculations, but told them that they must
repent of their sins, and turn to God.

2\. The miracles they wrought. The power Christ gave them over unclean
spirits, was not ineffectual, nor did they receive it in vain, but used
it, for they cast out many devils ([Mar
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#013).md); and they anointed with oil many
that were sick, and healed them. Some think this oil was used
medicinally, according to the custom of the Jews; but I rather think it
was used as a sign of miraculous healing, by the appointment of Christ,
though not mentioned; and it was afterward used by those elders of the
church, to whom by the Spirit was given the gift of healing, [Jam
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#014.md). It is certain here, and
therefore probable there, that anointing the sick with oil, is
appropriated to that extraordinary power which has long ceased, and
therefore that sign must cease with it.

[Mark 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 6:14</span></span>

Here is, I. The wild notions that the people had concerning our Lord
Jesus, [Mar 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#015.md). His own countrymen
could believe nothing great concerning him, because they knew his poor
kindred; but others that were not under the power of that prejudice
against him, were yet willing to believe any thing rather than the truth
- that he was the Son of God, and the true Messias: they said, He is
Elias, whom they expected; or, He is a prophet, one of the Old Testament
prophets raised to life, and returned to this world; or as one of the
prophets, a prophet now newly raised up, equal to those under the Old
Testament.

II\. The opinion of Herod concerning him. He heard of his name and fame,
of what he said and what he did; and he said, "It is certainly John
Baptist, [Mar 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#014.md). As sure as we are
here, It is John, whom I beheaded, [Mar
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#016.md). He is risen from the dead; and
though while he was with us he did no miracle, yet, having removed for
awhile to another world, he is come again with greater power, and now
mighty works do show forth themselves in him."

Note, 1. Where there is an idle faith, there is commonly a working
fancy. The people said, It is a prophet risen from the dead; Herod said,
It is John Baptist risen from the dead. It seems by this, that the
rising of a prophet from the dead, to do mighty works, was a thing
expected, and was thought neither impossible nor improbable, and it was
now readily suspected when it was not true; but afterward, when it was
true concerning Christ, and a truth undeniably evidenced, yet then it
was obstinately gainsaid and denied. Those who most wilfully disbelieve
the truth, are commonly most credulous of errors and fancies.

2\. They who fight against the cause of God, will find themselves
baffled, even when they think themselves conquerors; they cannot gain
their point, for the word of the Lord endures for ever. They who
rejoiced when the witnesses were slain, fretted as much, when in three
or four days they rose again in their successors, [Rev
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#010.md), [Rev
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#011.md). The impenitent unreformed
sinner, that escapeth the sword of Jehu, shall Elisha slay.

3\. A guilty conscience needs no accuser or tormentor but itself. Herod
charges himself with the murder of John, which perhaps no one else dare
charge him with; I beheaded him; and the terror of it made him imagine
that Christ was John risen. He feared John while he lived, and now, when
he thought he had got clear of him, fears him ten times worse when he is
dead. One might as well be haunted with ghosts and furies, as with the
horrors of an accusing conscience; those therefore who would keep an
undisturbed peace, must keep an undefiled conscience, [Act
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#016.md).

4\. There may be the terrors of strong conviction, where there is not
the truth of a saving conversion. This Herod, who had this notion
concerning Christ, afterward sought to kill him ([Luk
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#031).md), and did set him at nought
([Luk 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#011).md); so that he will not be
persuaded, though it be by one risen from the dead; no, not by a John
the Baptist risen from the dead.

III\. A narrative of Herod's putting John Baptist to death, which is
brought in upon this occasion, as it was in Matthew. And here we may
observe,

1\. The great value and veneration which Herod had some time had for
John Baptist, which is related only by this evangelist, [Mar
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#020.md). Here we see what a great way a
man may go toward grace and glory, and yet come short of both, and
perish eternally.

(1.) He feared John, knowing that he was a just man, and a holy. It is
possible that a man may have a great reverence for good men, and
especially for good ministers, yea, and for that in them that is good,
and yet himself be a bad man. Observe, \[1.\] John was a just man, and a
holy; to make a complete good man, both justice and holiness are
necessary; holiness toward God, and justice toward men. John was
mortified to this world, and so was a good friend both to justice and
holiness. \[2.\] Herod knew this, not only by common fame, but by
personal acquaintance with him. Those that have but little justice and
holiness themselves, may yet discern it with respect in others. And,
\[3.\] He therefore feared him, he honoured him. Holiness and justice
command veneration, and many that are not good themselves, have respect
for those that are.

(2.) He observed him; he sheltered him from the malice of his enemies
(so some understand it); or, rather, he had a regard to his exemplary
conversation, and took notice of that in him that was praiseworthy, and
commended it in the hearing of those about him; he made it appear that
he observed what John said and did.

(3.) He heard him preach; which was great condescension, considering how
mean John's appearance was. To hear Christ himself preach in our streets
will be but a poor plea in the great day, [Luk
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#026.md).

(4.) He did many of those things which John in his preaching taught him.
He was not only a hearer of the word, but in part a doer of the work.
Some sins which John in his preaching reproved, he forsook, and some
duties he bound himself to; but it will not suffice to do many things,
unless we have respect to all the commandments.

(5.) He heard him gladly. He did not hear him with terror as Felix heard
Paul, but heard him with pleasure. There is a flashy joy, which a
hypocrite may have in hearing the word; Ezekiel was to his hearers as a
lovely song ([Eze 33:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#032).md); and the
stony ground received the word with joy, [Luk
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#013.md).

2\. John's faithfulness to Herod, in telling him of his faults. Herod
had married his brother Philip's wife, [Mar
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#017.md). All the country, no doubt, cried
shame on him for it, and reproached him for it; but John reproved him,
told him plainly, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.
This was Herod's own iniquity, which he could not leave, when he did
many things that John taught him; and therefore John tells him of this
particularly. Though he were a king, he would not spare him, any more
than Elijah did Ahab, when he said, Hast thou killed and also taken
possession? Though John had an interest in him, and he might fear this
plain-dealing would destroy his interest, yet he reproved him; for
faithful are the wounds of a friend ([Pro
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#006).md); and though there are some swine
that will turn again, and rend those that cast pearls before them, yet,
ordinarily, he that rebuketh a man (if the person reproved has any thing
of the understanding of a man), afterwards shall find more favour than
he that flattereth with his tongue, [Pro
28:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#023.md). Though it was dangerous to
offend Herod, and much more to offend Herodias, yet John would run the
hazard rather than be wanting in his duty. Note, Those ministers that
would be found faithful in the work of God, must not be afraid of the
face of man. If we seek to please men, further than is for their
spiritual good, we are not the servants of Christ.

3\. The malice which Herodias bore to John for this ([Mar
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#019).md); She had a quarrel with him, and
would have killed him; but when she could not obtain that, she got him
committed to prison, [Mar 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#017.md). Herod
respected him, till he touched him in his Herodias. Many that pretend to
honour prophesying, are for smooth things only, and love good preaching,
if it keep far enough from their beloved sin; but if that be touched,
they cannot bear it. No marvel if the world hate those who testify of it
that its works are evil. But it is better that sinners persecute
ministers now for their faithfulness, than curse them eternally for
their unfaithfulness.

4\. The plot laid to take off John's head. I am apt to think that Herod
was himself in the plot, notwithstanding his pretences to be displeased
and surprised, and that the thing was concerted between him and
Herodias; for it is said to be when a convenient day was come ([Mar
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#021)), fit for such a purpose. (1..md)
There must be a ball at court, upon the king's birthday, and a supper
prepared for his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee.
(2.) To grace the solemnity, the daughter of Herodias must dance
publicly, and Herod must take on him to be wonderfully charmed with her
dancing; and if he be, they that sit with him cannot but, in compliment
to him, be so too. (3.) The king hereupon must make her an extravagant
promise, to give her whatever she would ask, even to the half of the
kingdom; and yet, that, if rightly understood, would not have reached
the end designed, for John Baptist's head was worth more than his whole
kingdom. This promise is bound with an oath, that no room might be left
to fly off from it; He sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask, I will
give. I can scarcely think he would have made such an unlimited promise,
but that he knew what she would ask. (4.) She, being instructed by
Herodias her mother, asked the head of John Baptist; and she must have
it brought her in a charger, as a pretty thing for her to play with
([Mar 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#024.md), [Mar
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#025).md); and there must be no delay, no
time lost, she must have it by and by. (5.) Herod granted it, and the
execution was done immediately while the company were together, which we
can scarcely think the king would have done, if he had not determined
the matter before. But he takes on him, \[1.\] To be very backward to
it, and that he would not for all the world have done it, if he had not
been surprised into such a promise; The king was exceeding sorry, that
is, he seemed to be so, he said he was so, he looked as if he had been
so; but it was all sham and grimace, he was really pleased that he had
found a pretence to get John out of the way. Qui nescit dissimulare,
nescit regnare - The man who cannot dissemble, knows not how to reign.
And yet he was not without sorrow for it; he could not do it but with
great regret and reluctancy; natural conscience will not suffer men to
sin easily; the very commission of it is vexatious; what then will the
reflection upon it be? \[2.\] He takes on him to be very sensible of the
obligation of his oath; whereas if the damsel had asked but a fourth
part of his kingdom, I doubt not but he would have found out a way to
evade his oath. The promise was rashly made, and could not bind him to
do an unrighteous thing. Sinful oaths must be repented of, and therefore
not performed; for repentance is the undoing of what we have done amiss,
as far as is in our power. When Theodosius the emperor was urged by a
suitor with a promise, he answered, I said it, but did not promise it if
it be unjust. If we may suppose that Herod knew nothing of the design
when he made that rash promise, it is probable that he was hurried into
the doing of it by those about him, only to carry on the humour; for he
did it for their sakes who sat with him, whose company he was proud of,
and therefore would do any thing to gratify them. Thus do princes make
themselves slave to those whose respect they covet, and both value and
secure themselves by. None of Herod's subjects stood in more awe of him
than he did of his lords, high captains, and chief estates. The king
sent an executioner, a soldier of his guard. Bloody tyrants have
executioners ready to obey their most cruel and unrighteous decrees.
Thus Saul has a Doeg at hand, to fall upon the priests of the Lord, when
his own footmen declined it.

5\. The effect of this is, (1.) That Herod's wicked court is all in
triumph, because this prophet tormented them; the head is made a present
of to the damsel, and by her to her mother, [Mar
6:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#028). (2..md) That John Baptist's sacred
college is all in tears; the disciples of John little thought of this;
but, when they heard of it, they came, and took up the neglected corpse,
and laid it in a tomb; where Herod, if he had pleased, might have found
it, when he frightened himself with the fancy that John Baptist was
risen from the dead.

[Mark 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 6:30</span></span>

In there verses, we have,

I. The return to Christ of the apostles whom he had sent forth ([Mar
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#007).md), to preach, and work miracles.
They had dispersed themselves into several quarters of the country for
some time, but when they had made good their several appointments, by
consent they gathered themselves together, to compare notes, and came to
Jesus, the centre of their unity, to give him an account of what they
had done pursuant to their commission: as the servant that was sent to
invite to the feast, and had received answers from the guests, came, and
showed his Lord all those things, so did the apostles here; they told
him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.
Ministers are accountable both for what they do, and for what they
teach; and must both watch over their own souls, and watch for the souls
of others, as those that must give account, [Heb
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017.md). Let them not either do any
thing, or teach any thing, but what they are willing should be related
and repeated to the Lord Jesus. It is a comfort to faithful ministers,
when they can appeal to Christ concerning their doctrine and manner of
life, both which perhaps have been misrepresented by men; and he gives
them leave to be free with him, and to lay open their case before him,
to tell him all things, what treatment they have met with, what success,
and what disappointment.

II\. The tender care Christ took for their repose, after the fatigue
they had ([Mar 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#031).md); He said unto
them, perceiving them to be almost spent, and out of breath, Come ye
yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest awhile. It should seem
that John's disciples came to Christ with the mournful tidings of their
master's death, much about the same time that his own disciples came to
him with the report of their negotiation. Note, Christ takes cognizance
of the frights of some, and the toils of others, of his disciples, and
provides suitable relief for both, rest for those that are tired, and
refuge for those that are terrified. With what kindness and compassion
doth Christ say to them, Come, and rest! Note, The most active servants
of Christ cannot be always upon the stretch of business, but have bodies
that require some relaxation, some breathing-time; we shall not be able
to serve God without ceasing, day and night, till we come to heaven,
where they never rest from praising him, [Rev
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#008.md). And the Lord is for the body,
considers its frame, and not only allows it time for rest, but puts it
in mind of resting. Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers.
Return to thy rest. And those that work diligently and faithfully, may
cheerfully retire to rest. The sleep of the labouring man is sweet. But
observe, 1. Christ calls them to come themselves apart; for, if they had
any body with them, they would have something to say, or something to
do, for their good; if they must rest, they must be alone. 2. He invites
them not to some pleasant country-seat, where there were fine buildings
and fine gardens, but into a desert place, where the accommodations were
very poor, and which was fitted by nature only, and not by art, for
quietness and rest. But it was of a piece with all the other
circumstances he was in; no wonder that he who had but a ship for his
preaching place, had but a desert for his resting place. 3. He calls
them only to rest awhile; they must not expect to rest long, only to get
breath, and then to go to work again. There is no remaining rest for the
people of God till they come to heaven. 4. The reason given for this,
is, not so much because they had been in constant work, but because they
now were in a constant hurry; so that they had not their work in any
order; for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so
much as to eat. Let but proper time be set, and kept for every thing,
and a great deal of work may be done with a great deal of ease; but if
people be continually coming and going, and no rule or method be
observed, a little work will not be done without a deal of trouble. 5.
They withdrew, accordingly, by ship; not crossing the water, but making
a coasting voyage to the desert of Bethsaida, [Mar
6:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#032.md). Going by water was much less
toilsome than going by land would have been. They went away privately,
that they might be by themselves. The most public persons cannot but
wish to be private sometimes.

III\. The diligence of the people to follow him. It was rude to do so,
when he and his disciples were desirous, for such good reason, to
retire; and yet they are not blamed for it, nor bid to go back, but bid
welcome. Note, A failure in good manners will easily be excused in those
who follow Christ, if it be but made up in a fulness of good affections.
They followed him of their own accord, without being called upon. Here
is no time set, no meeting appointed, no bell tolled; yet they thus fly
like a cloud, and as the doves to their windows. They followed him out
of the cities, quitted their houses and shops, their callings and
affairs, to hear him preach. They followed him afoot, though he was gone
by sea, and so, to try them, seemed to put a slight upon them, and to
endeavour to shake them off; yet they stuck to him. They ran afoot, and
made such haste, that they out-went the disciples, and came together to
him with an appetite to the word of God. Nay they followed him, though
it was into a desert place, despicable and inconvenient. The presence of
Christ will turn a wilderness into a paradise.

IV\. The entertainment Christ gave them ([Mar
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#034).md); When he saw much people,
instead of being moved with displeasure, because they disturbed him when
he desired to be private, as many a man, many a good man, would have
been, he was moved with compassion toward them, and looked upon them
with concern, because they were as sheep having no shepherd, they seemed
to be well-inclined, and manageable as sheep, and willing to be taught,
but they had no shepherd, none to lead and guide them in the right way,
none to feed them with good doctrine: and therefore, in compassion to
them, he not only healed their sick, as it is in Matthew, but he taught
them many things, and we may be sure that they were all true and good,
and fit for them to learn.

V. The provision he made for them all; all his hearers he generously
made his guests, and treated them at a splendid entertainment: so it
might truly be called, because a miraculous one.

1\. The disciples moved that they should be sent home. When the day was
not far spent, and night drew on, they said, This is a desert place, and
much time is now past; send them away to buy bread, [Mar
6:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#035.md), [Mar
6:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#036.md). This the disciples suggested to
Christ; but we do not find that the multitude themselves did. They did
not say, Send us away (though they could not but be hungry), for they
esteemed the words of Christ's mouth more than their necessary food, and
forgot themselves when they were hearing him; but the disciples thought
it would be a kindness to them to dismiss them. Note, Willing minds will
do more, and hold out longer, in that which is good, than one would
expect from them.

2\. Christ ordered that they should all be fed ([Mar
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#037).md); Give ye them to eat. Though
their crowding after him and his disciples hindered them from eating
([Mar 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#031).md), yet he would not
therefore, to be even with them, send them away fasting, but, to teach
us to be kind to those who are rude to us, he ordered provision to be
made for them; that bread which Christ and his disciples took with them
into the desert, that they might make a quiet meal of it for themselves,
he will have them to partake of. Thus was he given to hospitality. They
attended on the spiritual food of his word, and then he took care that
they should not want corporal food. The way of duty, as it is the way of
safety, so it is the way to supply. Let God alone to fill the pools with
rain from heaven, and so to make a well even in the valley of Baca, for
those that are going Zion-ward, from strength to strength, [Psa
84:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006.md), [Psa
84:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#007.md). Providence, not tempted, but
duly trusted, never yet failed any of God's faithful servants, but has
refreshed many with seasonable and surprising relief. It has often been
seen in the mount of the Lord, Jehovah-jireh, that the Lord will provide
for those that wait on him.

3\. The disciples objected against it as impracticable; Shall we go, and
buy two hundred penny-worth of bread, and give them to eat? Thus,
through the weakness of their faith, instead of waiting for directions
from Christ, they perplex the cause with projects of their own. It was a
question, whether they had two hundred pence with them, whether the
country would of a sudden afford so much bread if they had, and whether
that would suffice so great a company; but thus Moses objected ([Num
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#022).md), Shall the flocks and the herds
be slain for them? Christ would let them see their folly in forecasting
for themselves, that they might put the greater value upon his provision
for them.

4\. Christ effected it, to universal satisfaction. They had brought with
them five loaves, for the victualling of their ship, and two fishes
perhaps they caught as they came along; and that is the bill of fare.
This was but a little for Christ and his disciples, and yet this they
must give away, as the widow her two mites, and as the church of
Macedonia's deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality. We
often find Christ entertained at other people's tables, dining with one
friend, and supping with another: but here we have him supping a great
many at his own charge, which shows that, when others ministered to him
of their substance, it was not because he could not supply himself
otherwise (if he was hungry, he needed not tell them); but it was a
piece of humiliation, that he was pleased to submit to, nor was it
agreeable to the intention of miracles, that he should work them for
himself. Observe,

(1.) The provision was ordinary. Here were no rarities, no varieties,
though Christ, if he had pleased, could have furnished his table with
them; but thus he would teach us to be content with food convenient for
us, and not to be desirous of dainties. If we have for necessity, it is
no matter though we have not for delicacy and curiosity. God, in love,
gives meat for our hunger; but, in wrath, gives meat for our lusts, [Psa
78:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#018.md). The promise to them that fear
the Lord, is, that verily they shall be fed; he doth not say, They shall
be feasted. If Christ and his disciples took up with mean things, surely
we may.

(2.) The guests were orderly; for they sat down by companies on the
green grass ([Mar 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#039).md), they sat down
in ranks by hundreds and by fifties ([Mar
6:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#040).md), that the provision might the
more easily and regularly be distributed among them; for God is the God
of order, and not of confusion. Thus care was taken that every one
should have enough, and none be over-looked, nor any have more than was
fitting.

(3.) A blessing was craved upon the meat; He looked up to heaven, and
blessed. Christ did not call one of his disciples to crave a blessing,
but did it himself ([Mar 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#041).md); and by
virtue of this blessing the bread strangely multiplied, and so did the
fishes, for they did all eat, and were filled, though they were to the
number of five thousand, [Mar 6:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#042.md),
[Mar 6:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#044.md). This miracle was
significant, and shows that Christ came into the world, to be the great
feeder as well as the great healer; not only to restore, but to preserve
and nourish, spiritual life; and in him there is enough for all that
come to him, enough to fill the soul, to fill the treasures; none are
sent empty away from Christ, but those that come to him full of
themselves.

(4.) Care was taken of the fragments that remained, with which they
filled twelve baskets. Though Christ had bread enough at command, he
would hereby teach us, not to make waste of any of God's good creatures;
remembering how many there are that do want, and that we know not but we
may some time or other want such fragments as we throw away.

[Mark 6:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mar 6:45</span></span>

This passage of story we had [Mat
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#022.md), etc., only what was there
related concerning Peter, is omitted here. Here we have,

I. The dispersing of the assembly; Christ constrained his disciples to
go before by ship to Bethsaida, intending to follow them, as they
supposed, by land. The people were loth to scatter, so that it cost him
some time and pains to send them away. For now that they had got a good
supper, they were in no haste to leave him. But as long as we are here
in this world, we have no continuing city, no not in communion with
Christ. The everlasting feast is reserved for the future state.

II\. Christ departed into a mountain, to pray. Observe, 1. He prayed;
though he had so much preaching-work upon his hands, yet he was much in
prayer; he prayed often, and prayed long, which is an encouragement to
us to depend upon the intercession he is making for us at the right hand
of the Father, that continual intercession. 2. He went alone, to pray;
though he needed not to retire for the avoiding either of distraction or
of ostentation, yet, to set us an example, and to encourage us in our
secret addresses to God, he prayed alone, and, for want of a closet,
went up into a mountain, to pray. A good man is never less alone than
when alone with God.

III\. The disciples were in distress at sea; The wind was contrary ([Mar
6:48](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#048).md), so that they toiled in rowing,
and could not get forward. This was a specimen of the hardships they
were to expect, when hereafter he should send them abroad to preach the
gospel; it would be like sending them to sea at this time with the wind
in their teeth: they must expect to toil in rowing, they must work hard
to strive against so strong a stream; they must likewise expect to be
tossed with waves, to be persecuted by their enemies; and by exposing
them now he intended to train them up for such difficulties, that they
might learn to endure hardness. The church is often like a ship at sea,
tossed with tempests, and not comforted we may have Christ for us, and
yet wind and tide against us; but it is a comfort to Christ's disciples
in a storm, that their Master is in the heavenly mount, interceding for
them.

IV\. Christ made them a kind visit upon the water. He could have checked
the winds, where he was, or have sent an angel to their relief; but he
chose to help them in the most endearing manner possible, and therefore
came to them himself.

1\. He did not come till the fourth watch of the night, not till after
three o'clock in the morning; but then he came. Note, If Christ's visits
to his people be deferred long, yet at length he will come; and their
extremity is his opportunity to appear for them so much the more
seasonably. Though the salvation tarry, yet we must wait for it; at the
end it shall speak, in the fourth watch of the night, and not lie.

2\. He came, walking upon the waters. The sea was now tossed with waves,
and yet Christ came, walking upon it; for though the floods lift up
their voice, the Lord on high is mightier, [Psa
93:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#003.md), [Psa
93:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#004.md). No difficulties can obstruct
Christ's gracious appearances for his people, when the set time is come.
He will either find, or force, a way through the most tempestuous sea,
for their deliverance, [Psa 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007.md), [Psa
42:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008.md),

3\. He would have passed by them, that is, he set his face and steered
his course, as if he would have gone further, and took no notice of
them; this he did, to awaken them to call to him. Note, Providence, when
it is acting designedly and directly for the succour of God's people,
yet sometimes seems as if it were giving them the go-by, and regarded
not their case. They thought that he would, but we may be sure that he
would not, have passed by them.

4\. They were frightened at the sight of him, supposing him to have been
an apparition; They all saw him, and were troubled ([Mar
6:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#050).md), thinking it had been some
daemon, or evil genius, that haunted them, and raised this storm. We
often perplex and frighten ourselves with phantasms, the creatures of
our own fancy and imagination.

5\. He encouraged them, and silenced their fears, by making himself
known to them; he talked familiarly with them, saying, Be of good cheer,
it is I; be not afraid. Note, (1.) We know not Christ till he is pleased
to reveal himself to us. "It is I; I your Master, I your friend, I your
Redeemer and Saviour. It is I, that came to a troublesome earth, and now
to a tempestuous sea, to look after you." (2.) The knowledge of Christ,
as he is in himself, and near to us, is enough to make the disciples of
Christ cheerful even in a storm, and no longer fearful. If it be so, why
am I thus? If it is Christ that is with thee, be of good cheer, be not
afraid. Our fears are soon satisfied, if our mistakes be but rectified,
especially our mistakes concerning Christ. See [Gen
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#019.md); [Kg2
6:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#015.md). Christ's presence with us in
a stormy day, is enough to make us of good cheer, though clouds and
darkness be round about us. He said, It is I. He doth not tell them who
he was (there was no occasion), they knew his voice, as the sheep know
the voice of their own shepherd, [Joh
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#004.md). How readily doth the spouse say,
once and again, It is the voice of my beloved! [Sol
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#008.md); [Sol
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002.md). He said, egō eimi - I am he; or I
am; it is God's name, when he comes to deliver Israel, [Exo
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#014.md). So it is Christ's, now that he
comes to deliver his disciples. When Christ said to those that came to
apprehend him by force, I am he, they were struck down by it, [Joh
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#006.md). When he saith to those that come
to apprehend him by faith, I am he, they are raised up by it, and
comforted.

6\. He went up to them into the ship, embarked in the same bottom with
them, and so made them perfectly easy. Let them but have their Master
with them, and all is well. And as soon as he was come into the ship,
the wind ceased. In the former storm that they were in, it is said, He
arose, and rebuked the winds, and said to the sea, Peace, be still ([Mar
4:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#039).md); but here we read of no such
formal command given, only the wind ceased all of a sudden. note, Our
Lord Jesus will be sure to do his own work always effectually, though
not always alike solemnly, and with observation. Though we hear not the
command given, yet, if thus the wind cease, and we have the comfort of a
calm, say, It is because Christ is in the ship, and his decree is gone
forth or ever we are aware, [Sol 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#012.md).
When we come with Christ to heaven, the wind ceaseth presently; there
are no storms in the upper region.

7\. They were more surprised and astonished at this miracle than did
become them, and there was that at the bottom of their astonishment,
which was really culpable; They were sore amazed in themselves, were in
a perfect ecstasy; as if it were a new and unaccountable thing, as if
Christ had never done the like before, and they had no reason to expect
he should do it now; they ought to admire the power of Christ, and to be
confirmed hereby in their belief of his being the Son of God: but why
all this confusion about it? It was because they considered not the
miracle of the loaves; had they given that its due weight, they would
not have been so much surprised at this; for his multiplying the bread
was as great an instance of his power as his walking on the water. They
were strangely stupid and unthinking, and their heart was hardened, or
else they would not have thought it a thing incredible that Christ
should command a calm. It is for want of a right understanding of
Christ's former works, that we are transported at the thought of his
present works, as if there never were the like before.

V. When they came to the land of Gennesaret, which lay between Bethsaida
and Capernaum, the people bid them very welcome; The men of that place
presently knew Jesus ([Mar 6:54](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#054).md), and
knew what mighty works he did wherever he came, what a universal Healer
he was; they knew likewise that he used to stay but a little while at a
place, and therefore they were concerned to improve the opportunity of
this kind visit which he made them; They ran through that whole region
round about, with all possible expedition, and began to carry about in
beds those that were sick, and not able to go themselves; there was no
danger of their getting cold when they hoped to get a cure, [Mar
6:55](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#055.md). Let him go where he would, he
was crowded with patients - in towns, in the cities, in the villages
about the cities; they laid the sick in the streets, to be in his way,
and begged leave for them to touch if it were but the border of his
garment, as the woman with the bloody issue did, by whom, it should
seem, this method of application was first brought in; and as many as
touched, were made whole. We do not find that they were desirous to be
taught by him, only to be healed. If ministers could not cure people's
bodily diseases, what multitudes would attend them! But it is sad to
think how much more concerned the most of men are about their bodies
than about their souls.
