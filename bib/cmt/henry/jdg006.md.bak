### [Judges Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#001.md)

[Judges](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jdg 6:0</span></span>

Nothing that occurred in the quiet and peaceable times of Israel is
recorded; the forty years' rest after the conquest of Jabin is passed
over in silence; and here begins the story of another distress and
another deliverance, by Gideon, the fourth of the judges. Here is, I.
The calamitous condition of Israel, by the inroads of the Midianites
([Jdg 6:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#001).md). II. The message God sent
them by a prophet, by convincing them of sin, to prepare them for
deliverance ([Jdg 6:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#007).md). III. The
raising up of Gideon to be their deliverer. 1. A commission which God
sent him by the hand of an angel, and confirmed by a sign ([Jdg
6:11-24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#011).md). 2. The first-fruits of his
government in the reform of his father's house ([Jdg
6:25-32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#025).md). 3. The preparations he made
for a war with the Midianites, and the encouragement given him by a sign
([Jdg 6:33-40](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#033).md).

[Judges 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 6:1</span></span>

We have here, I. Israel's sin renewed: They did evil in the sight of the
Lord, [Jdg 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#001.md). The burnt child dreads
the fire; yet this perverse unthinking people, that had so often smarted
sorely for their idolatry, upon a little respite of God's judgments
return to it again. This people hath a revolting rebellious heart, not
kept in awe by the terror of God's judgments, nor engaged in honour and
gratitude by the great things he had done for them to keep themselves in
his love. The providence of God will not change the hearts and lives of
sinners.

II\. Israel's troubles repeated. This would follow of course; let all
that sin expect to suffer; let all that return to folly expect to return
to misery. With the froward God will show himself froward ([Psa
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026).md), and will walk contrary to
those that walk contrary to him, [Lev
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#021.md), [Lev
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#024.md). Now as to this trouble, 1. It
arose from a very despicable enemy. God delivered them into the hand of
Midian ([Jdg 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#001).md), not Midian in the
south where Jethro lived, but Midian in the east that joined to Moab
([Num 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#004).md), a people that all men
despised as uncultivated and unintelligent; hence we read not here of
any king, lord, or general, that they had, but the force with which they
destroyed Israel was an undisciplined mob; and, which made it the more
grievous, they were a people that Israel had formerly subdued, and in a
manner destroyed (see [Num 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#007).md), and
yet by this time (nearly 200 years after) the poor remains of them were
so multiplied, and so magnified, that they were capable of being made a
very severe scourge to Israel. Thus God moved them to jealousy with
those who were not a people, even a foolish nation, [Deu
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021.md). The meanest creature will serve
to chastise those that have made the great Creator their enemy. And,
when those we are authorized to rule prove rebellious and disobedient to
us, it concerns us to enquire whether we have not been so to our
sovereign Ruler. 2. It arose to a very formidable height ([Jdg
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#002).md): The hand of Midian prevailed,
purely by their multitude. God had promised to increase Israel as the
sand on the sea shore; but their sin stopped their growth and diminished
them, and then their enemies, though otherwise every way inferior to
them, overpowered them with numbers. They came upon them as grasshoppers
for multitude ([Jdg 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#005).md), not in a
regular army to engage them in the field, but in a confused swarm to
plunder the country, quarter themselves upon it, and enrich themselves
with its spoils - bands of robbers, and no better. And sinful Israel,
being separated by sin from God, had not spirit to make head against
them. Observe the wretched havoc that these Midianites made with their
bands of plunderers in Israel. Here we have, (1.) The Israelites
imprisoned, or rather imprisoning themselves, in dens and caves, [Jdg
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#002.md). This was owing purely to their
own timorousness and faint-heartedness, that they would rather fly than
fight; it was the effect of a guilty conscience, which made them tremble
at the shaking of a leaf, and the just punishment of their apostasy from
God, who thus fought against them with those very terrors with which he
would otherwise have fought for them. Had it not been for this, we
cannot but think Israel a match for the Midianites, and able enough to
make head against them; but the heart that departs from God is lost, not
only to that which is good, but to that which is great. Sin dispirits
men, and makes them sneak into dens and caves. The day will come when
chief captains and mighty men will call in vain to rocks and mountains
to hide them. (2.) The Israelites impoverished, greatly impoverished,
[Jdg 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#006.md). The Midianites and the other
children of the east that joined with them to live by spoil and rapine
(as long before the Sabeans and Chaldeans did that plundered Job,
free-booters) made frequent incursions into the land of Canaan. This
fruitful land was a great temptation to them; and the sloth and luxury
into which the Israelites had sunk by forty years' rest made them and
their substance an easy prey to them. They came up against them ([Jdg
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#003).md), pitched their camps among them
([Jdg 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#004).md), and brought their cattle
with them, particularly camels innumerable ([Jdg
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#005).md), not a flying party to make a
sally upon them and be gone presently, but they resolved to force their
way, and penetrated through the heart of the country as far as Gaza on
the western side, [Jdg 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#004.md). They let
the Israelites alone to sow their ground, but towards harvest they came
and seized all, and ate up and destroyed it, both grass and corn, and
when they went away took with them the sheep and oxen, so that in short
they left no sustenance for Israel, except what was privately taken by
the rightful owners into the dens and caves. Now here we may see, \[1.\]
The justice of God in the punishment of their sin. They had neglected to
honour God with their substance in tithes and offerings, and had
prepared that for Baal with which God should have been served, and now
God justly sends an enemy to take it away in the season thereof, [Hos
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#008.md), [Hos
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#009.md). \[2.\] The consequence of God's
departure from a people; when he goes all good goes and all mischiefs
break in. When Israel kept in with God, they reaped what others sowed
([Jos 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#013.md); [Psa
105:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#044).md); but now that God had forsaken
them others reaped what they sowed. Let us take occasion from this to
bless God for our national peace and tranquillity, that we eat the
labour of our hands.

III\. Israel's sense of God's hand revived at last. Seven years, year
after year, did the Midianites make these inroads upon them, each we may
suppose worse than the other ([Jdg
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#001).md), until at last, all other
succours failing, Israel cried unto the Lord ([Jdg
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#006).md), for crying to Baal ruined them,
and would not help them. When God judges he will overcome; and sinners
shall be made either to bend or break before him.

[Judges 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 6:7</span></span>

Observe here, I. The cognizance God took of the cries of Israel, when at
length they were directed towards him. Though in their prosperity they
had neglected him and made court to his rivals, and though they never
looked towards him until they were driven to it by extremity, yet, upon
their complain and prayer, he intended relief for them. Thus would he
show how ready he is to forgive, how swift he is to show mercy, and how
inclinable to hear prayer, that sinners may be encouraged to return and
repent, [Psa 130:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004.md).

II\. The method God took of working deliverance for them.

1\. Before he sent an angel to raise them up a saviour he sent a prophet
to reprove them for sin, and to bring them to repentance, [Jdg
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#008.md). This prophet is not named, but he
was a man, a prophet, not an angel, as [Jdg
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#001.md). Whether this prophet took an
opportunity of delivering his message to the children of Israel when
they had met together in a general assembly, at some solemn feast or
other great occasion, or whether he went from city to city and from
tribe to tribe, preaching to this purport, is not certain; but his
errand was to convince them of sin, that, in their crying to the Lord,
they might confess that with sorrow and shame, and not spend their
breath in only complaining of their trouble. They cried to God for a
deliverer, and God sent them a prophet to instruct them, and to make
them ready for deliverance. Note, (1.) We have reason to hope God is
designing mercy for us if we find he is by his grace preparing us for
it. If to those that are sick he sends a messenger, an interpreter, by
whom he shows unto man his uprightness, then he is gracious, and grants
a recovery, [Job 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023.md), [Job
33:24](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#024). (2..md) The sending of prophets to
a people, and the furnishing of a land with faithful ministers, is a
token for good, and an evidence that God has mercy in store for them. He
thus turns us to him, and then causes his face to shine, [Psa
80:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#019.md).

2\. We have here the heads of the message which this prophet delivered
in to Israel, in the name of the Lord.

(1.) He sets before them the great things God had done for them ([Jdg
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#008.md), [Jdg
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#009).md): Thus saith the Lord God of
Israel; they had worshipped the gods of the nations, as if they had had
no God of their own to worship and therefore might choose whom they
pleased; but they are here reminded of one whom they had forgotten, who
was known by the title of the God of Israel, and to him they must
return. They had turned to other gods, as if their own had been either
incapable or unwilling to protect them, and therefore they are told what
he did for their fathers, in whose loins they were, the benefit of which
descended and still remained to this their ungrateful seed. \[1.\] He
brought them out of Egypt, where otherwise they would have continued in
perpetual poverty and slavery. \[2.\] He delivered them out of the hands
of all that oppressed them; this is mentioned to intimate that the
reason why they were not now delivered out of the hands of the
oppressing Midianites was not for want of any power or good-will in God,
but because by their iniquity they had sold themselves, and God would
not redeem them until they by repentance revoked the bargain. \[3.\] He
put them in quiet possession of this good land; this not only aggravated
their sin, and affixed the brand of base ingratitude to it, but it
justified God, and cleared him from blame upon account of the trouble
they were now in. They could not say he was unkind, for he had given all
possible proofs of his designing well for them; if ill befel them
notwithstanding, they must thank themselves.

(2.) He shows the easiness and equity of God's demands and expectations
from them ([Jdg 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#010).md): "I am the Lord
your God, to whom you lie under the highest obligations, fear not the
gods of the Amorites," that is, "do not worship them, nor show any
respect to them; do not worship them for fear of their doing you any
hurt, for what hurt can they do you while I am your God? Fear God, and
you need not fear them."

(3.) He charges them with rebellion against God, who had laid this
injunction upon them: But you have not obeyed my voice. The charge is
short, but very comprehensive; this was the malignity of all their sin,
it was disobedience to God; and therefore it was this that brought those
calamities upon them under which they were now groaning, pursuant to the
threatenings annexed to his commands. He intends hereby to bring them to
repentance; and our repentance is then right and genuine when the
sinfulness of sin, as disobedience to God, is that in it which we
chiefly lament.

[Judges 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 6:11</span></span>

It is not said what effect the prophet's sermon had upon the people, but
we may hope it had a good effect, and that some of them at least
repented and reformed upon it; for here, immediately after, we have the
dawning of the day of their deliverance, by the effectual calling of
Gideon to take upon him the command of their forces against the
Midianites.

I. The person to be commissioned for this service was Gideon, the son of
Joash, [Jdg 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#014.md). The father was now
living, but he was passed by, and this honour put upon the son, for the
father kept up in his own family the worship of Baal ([Jdg
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#025).md), which we may suppose this son,
as far as was in his power, witnessed against. He was of the half tribe
of Manasseh that lay in Canaan, of the family of Abiezer; the eldest
house of that tribe, [Jos 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#002.md).
Hitherto the judges were raised up out of that tribe which suffered most
by the oppression, and probably it was so here.

II\. The person that gave him the commission was an angel of the Lord;
it should seem not a created angel, but the Son of God himself, the
eternal Word, the Lord of the angels, who then appeared upon some great
occasions in human shape, as a prelude (says the learned bishop Patrick)
to what he intended in the fulness of time, when he would take our
nature upon him, as we say, for good and all. This angel is here called
Jehovah, the incommunicable name of God ([Jdg
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#014.md), [Jdg
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#016).md), and he said, I will be with
thee.

1\. This divine person appeared here to Gideon, and it is observable how
he found him, (1.) Retired - all alone. God often manifests himself to
his people when they are out of the noise and hurry of this world.
Silence and solitude befriend our communion with God. (2.) Employed in
threshing wheat, with a staff or rod (so the word signifies), such as
they used in beating out fitches and cummin ([Isa
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#027).md), but now used for wheat,
probably because he had but little to thresh, he needed not the oxen to
tread it out. It was not then looked upon as any diminution to him,
though he was a person of some account and a mighty man of valour, to
lay his hand to the business of the husbandman. He had many servants
([Jdg 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#027).md), and yet would not himself
live in idleness. We put ourselves in the way of divine visits when we
employ ourselves in honest business. Tidings of Christ's birth were
brought to the shepherds when they were keeping their flocks. The work
he was about was an emblem of that greater work to which he was now to
be called, as the disciples' fishing was. From threshing corn he is
fetched to thresh the Midianites, [Isa
41:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#015). (3..md) Distressed; he was
threshing his wheat, not in the threshing-floor, the proper place, but
by the wine-press, in some private unsuspected corner, for fear of the
Midianites. He himself shared in the common calamity, and now the angel
came to animate him against Midian when he himself could speak so
feelingly of the heaviness of their yoke. The day of the greatest
distress is God's time to appear for his people's relief.

2\. Let us now see what passed between the angel and Gideon, who knew
not with certainty, till after he was gone, that he was an angel, but
supposed he was a prophet.

(1.) The angel accosted him with respect, and assured him of the
presence of God with him, [Jdg 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#012.md).
He calls him a mighty man of valour, perhaps because he observed how he
threshed his corn with all his might; and seest thou a man diligent in
his business? whatever his business is, he shall stand before kings. He
that is faithful in a few things shall be ruler over many. Gideon was a
man of a brave active spirit, and yet buried alive in obscurity, through
the iniquity of the times; but he is here animated to undertake
something great, like himself, with that word, The Lord is with thee,
or, as the Chaldee reads it, the Word of the Lord is thy help. It was
very sure that the Lord was with him when this angel was with him. By
this word, \[1.\] He gives him his commission. If we have God's presence
with us, this will justify us and bear us out in our undertakings.
\[2.\] He inspires him with all necessary qualifications for the
execution of his commission. "The Lord is with thee to guide and
strengthen thee, to animate and support thee." \[3.\] He assures him of
success; for, if God be for us, who can prevail against us? If he be
with us, nothing can be wanting to us. The presence of God with us is
all in all to our prosperity, whatever we do. Gideon was a mighty man of
valour, and yet he could bring nothing to pass without the presence of
God, and that presence is enough to make any man mighty in valour and to
give a man courage at any time.

(2.) Gideon gave a very melancholy answer to this joyful salutation
([Jdg 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#013).md): O my Lord! if the Lord be
with us (which the Chaldee reads, Is the Shechinah of the Lord our help?
making that the same with the Word of the Lord) why then has all this
befallen us? "all this trouble and distress from the Midianites'
incursions, which force me to thresh wheat here by the wine-press - all
this loss, and grief, and fright; and where are all the miracles which
our fathers told us of?" Observe, In his reply he regards not the praise
of his own valour, nor does this in the least elevate him or give him
any encouragement, though it is probable the angel adapted what he said
to that which Gideon was at the same time thinking of; while his
labouring hands were employed about his wheat, his working head and
daring heart were meditating Israel's rescue and Midian's ruin, with
which thought he that knows the heart seasonably sets in, calls him a
man of valour for his brave projects, and open him a way to put them in
execution; yet Gideon, as if not conscious to himself of any thing great
or encouraging in his own spirit, fastens only on the assurance the
angel had given him of God's presence, as that by which they held all
their comfort. Observe, The angel spoke in particular to him: The Lord
is with thee; but he expostulates for all: If the Lord be with us,
herding himself with the thousands of Israel, and admitting no comfort
but what they might be sharers in, so far is he from the thoughts of
monopolizing it, though he had so fair an occasion given him. Note,
Public spirits reckon that only an honour and joy to themselves which
puts them in a capacity of serving the common interests of God's church.
Gideon was a mighty man of valour, but as yet weak in faith, which makes
it hard to him to reconcile to the assurances now given him of the
presence of God, \[1.\] The distress to which Israel was reduced: Why
has all this (and all this was no little) befallen us? Note, It is
sometimes hard, but never impossible, to reconcile cross providences
with the presence of God and his favour. \[2.\] The delay of their
deliverance: "Where are all the miracles which our fathers told us of?
Why does not the same power which delivered our fathers from the yoke of
the Egyptians deliver us out of the hands of the Midianites?" As if
because God did not immediately work miracles for their deliverance,
though they had by their sins forfeited his favour and help, it must be
questioned whether ever he had wrought the miracles which their fathers
told them of, or, if he had, whether he had now the same wisdom, and
power, and good-will to his people, that he had had formerly. This was
his weakness. We must not expect that the miracles which were wrought
when a church was in the forming, and some great truth in the settling,
should be continued and repeated when the formation and settlement are
completed: no, nor that the mercies God showed to our fathers that
served him, and kept close to him, should be renewed to us, if we
degenerate and revolt from him. Gideon ought not to have said either,
First, That God had delivered them into the hands of the Midianites, for
by their iniquities they had sold themselves, or, Secondly, That now
they were in their hands he had forsaken them, for he had lately sent
them a prophet ([Jdg 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#008).md), which was a
certain indication that he had not forsaken them.

(3.) The angel gave him a very effectual answer to his objections, by
giving him a commission to deliver Israel out of the hands of the
Midianites, and assuring him of success therein, [Jdg
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#014.md). Now the angel is called Jehovah,
for he speaks as one having authority, and not as a messenger. \[1.\]
There was something extraordinary in the look he now gave to Gideon; it
was a gracious favourable look, which revived his spirits that dropped,
and silenced his fears, such a look as that with which God's countenance
beholds the upright, [Psa 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#007.md). He
looked upon him, and smiled at the objections he made, which he gave him
no direct answer to, but girded and clothed him with such power as would
shortly enable him to answer them himself, and make him ashamed that
ever he had made them. It was a speaking look, like Christ's upon Peter
([Luk 22:61](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#061).md), a powerful look, a look
that strangely darted new light and life into Gideon's breast, and
inspired him with a generous heat, far above what he felt before. \[2.\]
But there was much more in what he said to him. First, He commissioned
him to appear and act as Israel's deliverer. Such a one the few thinking
people in the nation, and Gideon among the rest, were now expecting to
be raised up, according to God's former method, in answer to the cries
of oppressed Israel; and now Gideon is told, "Thou art the man: Go in
this thy might, this might wherewith thou art now threshing wheat; go
and employ it to a nobler purpose; I will make thee a thresher of men."
Or, rather, "this might wherewith thou art now endued by this look." God
gave him his commission by giving him all the qualifications that were
necessary for the execution of it, which is more than the mightiest
prince and potentate on earth can do for those to whom he gives
commissions. God's fitting men for work is a sure and constant evidence
of his calling them to it. "Go, not in thy might, that which is natural,
and of thyself, depend not on thy own valour; but go in this thy might,
this which thou hast now received, go in the strength of the Lord God,
that is, the strength with which thou must strengthen thyself."
Secondly, He assured him of success. This was enough to put courage into
him; he might be confident he should not miscarry in the attempt; it
should not turn either to his own disgrace or the damage of his people
(as baffled enterprises do), but to his honour and their happiness: Thou
shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites, and so shalt not only
be an eye-witness, but a glorious instrument, of such wonders as thy
fathers told thee of. Gideon, we may suppose, looked as one astonished
at this strange and surprising power conferred upon him, and questions
whether he may depend upon what he hears: the angel ratifies his
commission with a teste meipso - an appeal to his own authority; there
needed no more. "Have not I commanded thee - I that have all power in
heaven and earth, and particular authority here as Israel's King, giving
commissions immediately - I who am that I am, the same that sent Moses?"
[Exo 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#014.md).

(4.) Gideon made a very modest objection against this commission ([Jdg
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#015).md): O my Lord! wherewith shall I
save Israel? This question bespeaks him either, \[1.\] Distrustful of
God and his power, as if, though God should be with him, yet it were
impossible for him to save Israel. True faith is often weak, yet it
shall not be rejected, but encouraged and strengthened. Or, \[2.\]
Inquisitive concerning the methods he must take: "Lord, I labour under
all imaginable disadvantages for it; if I must do it, thou must put me
in the way." Note, Those who receive commissions from God must expect
and seek for instructions from him. Or rather, \[3.\] Humble,
self-diffident, and self-denying. The angel had honoured him, but see
how meanly he speaks of himself: "My family is comparatively poor in
Manasseh" (impoverished, it may be, more than other families by the
Midianites), "and I am the least, that have the least honour and
interest, in my father's house; what can I pretend to do? I am utterly
unfit for the service, and unworthy of the honour." Note, God often
chooses to do great things by those that are little, especially that are
so in their own eyes. God delights to advance the humble.

(5.) This objection was soon answered by a repetition of the promise
that God would be with him, v. 16. "Object not thy poverty and meanness;
such things have indeed often hindered men in great enterprises, but
what are they to a man that has the presence of God with him, which will
make up all the deficiencies of honour and estate. Surely I will be with
thee, to direct and strengthen thee, and put such a reputation upon thee
that, how weak soever thy personal interest is, thou shalt have soldiers
enough to follow thee, and be assured thou shalt smite the Midianites as
one men, as easily as if they were but one man and as effectually. All
the thousands of Midian shall be as if they had but one neck, and thou
shalt have the cutting of it off."

(6.) Gideon desires to have his faith confirmed touching this
commission; for he would not be over-credulous of that which tended so
much to his own praise, would not venture upon an undertaking so far
above him, and in which he must engage many more, but he would be well
satisfied himself of his authority, and would be able to give
satisfaction to others as to him who gave him that authority. He
therefore humbly begs of this divine person, whoever he was, \[1.\] That
he would give him a sign, [Jdg 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#017.md).
And, the commission being given him out of the common road of
providence, he might reasonably expect it should be confirmed by some
act of God out of the common course of nature: "Show me a sign to assure
me of the truth of this concerning which thou talkest with me, that it
is something more than talk, and that thou art in earnest." Now, under
the dispensation of the Spirit, we are not to expect signs before our
eyes, such as Gideon here desired, but must earnestly pray to God that,
if we have found grace in his sight, he would show us a sign in our
heart, by the powerful operations of his Spirit there, fulfilling the
work of faith, and perfecting what is lacking in it. \[2.\] In order
hereunto, that he would accept of a treat, and so give him a further and
longer opportunity of conversation with him, [Jdg
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#018.md). Those who know what it is to
have communion with God desire the continuance of it, and are loth to
part, praying with Gideon, Depart not hence, I pray thee. That which
Gideon desired in courting his stay was that he might bring out some
provision of meat for this stranger. He did not take him into the house
to entertain him there, perhaps because his father's house were not well
affected to him and his friends, or because he desired still to be in
private with this stranger, and to converse with him alone (therefore he
calls not for a servant to bring the provision, but fetches it himself),
or because thus his father Abraham entertained angels unawares, not in
his tent, but under a tree, [Gen 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#008.md).
Upon the angel's promise to stay to dinner with him, he hastened to
bring out a kid, which, it is likely, was ready boiled for his own
dinner, so that in making it ready he had nothing to do but to put it in
the basket (for here was no sauce to serve it up in, nor the dish
garnished) and the broth in a vessel, and so he presented it, [Jdg
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#019.md). Hereby he intended, First, To
testify his grateful and generous respects to this stranger, and, in
him, to God who sent him, as one that studied what he should render. He
had pleaded the poverty of his family ([Jdg
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#015).md) to excuse himself from being a
general, but not here to excuse himself from being hospitable. Out of
the little which the Midianites had left him he would gladly spare
enough to entertain a friend, especially a messenger from heaven.
Secondly, To try who and what this extraordinary person was. What he
brought out is called his present, [Jdg
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#018.md). It is the same word that is used
for a meat-offering, and perhaps that word is used which signifies both
because Gideon intended to leave it to this divine person to determine
which it should be when he had it before him: whether a feast or a
meat-offering, and accordingly he would be able to judge concerning him:
if he ate of it as common meat, he would suppose him to be a man, a
prophet; if otherwise, as it proved, he should know him to be an angel.

(7.) The angel gives him a sign in and by that which he had kindly
prepared for his entertainment. For what we offer to God for his glory,
and in token of our gratitude to him, will be made by the grace of God
to turn to our own comfort and satisfaction. The angel ordered him to
take the flesh and bread out of the basket, and lay it upon a hard and
cold rock, and to pour out the broth upon it, which, if he brought it
hot, would soon be cold there; and Gideon did so ([Jdg
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#020).md), believing that the angel
appointed it, not in contempt of his courtesy, but with an intention to
give him a sign, which he did, abundantly to his satisfaction. For,
\[1.\] He turned the meat into an offering made by fire, of a sweet
savour unto himself, showing hereby that he was not a man who needed
meat, but the Son of God who was to be served and honoured by sacrifice,
and who in the fulness of time was to make himself a sacrifice. \[2.\]
He brought fire out of the rock, to consume this sacrifice, summoning
it, not by striking the rock, as we strike fire out of a flint, but by a
gentle touch given to the offering with the end of his staff, [Jdg
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#021.md). Hereby he gave him a sign that
he had found grace in his sight, for God testified his acceptance of
sacrifices by kindling them, if public, with fire from heaven, as those
of Moses and Elias, if private, as this, with fire out of the earth,
which was equivalent: both were the effect of divine power; and this
acceptance of his sacrifice evidenced the acceptance of his person,
confirmed his commission, and perhaps was intended to signify his
success in the execution of it, that he and his army should be a
surprising terror and consumption to the Midianites, like this fire out
of the rock. \[3.\] He departed out of his sight immediately, did not
walk off as a man, but vanished and disappeared as a spirit. Here was as
much of a sign as he could wish.

(8.) Gideon, though no doubt he was confirmed in his faith by the
indications given of the divinity of the person who had spoken to him,
yet for the present was put into a great fright by it, till God
graciously pacified him and removed his fears. \[1.\] Gideon speaks
peril to himself ([Jdg 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#022).md): When he
perceived that he was an angel (which was not till he had departed, as
the two disciples knew not it was Jesus they had been talking with till
he was going, [Luk 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#031).md), then he
cried out, Alas! O Lord God! be merciful to me, I am undone, for I have
seen an angel, as Jacob, who wondered that his life was preserved when
he had seen God, [Gen 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#030.md). Ever
since man has by sin exposed himself to God's wrath and curse an express
from heaven has been a terror to him, as he scarcely dares to expect
good tidings thence; at least, in this world of sense, it is a very
awful thing to have any sensible conversation with that world of spirits
to which we are so much strangers. Gideon's courage failed him now.
\[2.\] God speaks peace to him, [Jdg
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#023.md). It might have been fatal to him,
but he assures him it should not. The Lord had departed out of his
sight, [Jdg 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#021.md). But though he must
no longer walk by sight he might still live by faith, that faith which
comes by hearing; for the Lord said to him, with an audible voice (as
bishop Patrick thinks) these encouraging words, "Peace be unto thee, all
is well, and be thou satisfied that it is so. Fear not; he that came to
employ thee did not intend to slay thee; thou shalt not die." See how
ready God is to revive the hearts of those that tremble at his word and
presence, and to give those that stand in awe of his majesty assurances
of his mercy.

3\. The memorial of this vision which Gideon set up was a monument in
form of an altar, the rather because it was by a kind of sacrifice upon
a rock, without the solemnity of an altar, that the angel manifested his
acceptance of him; then an altar was unnecessary (the angel's staff was
sufficient to sanctify the gift without an altar), but now it was of use
to preserve the remembrance of the vision, which was done by the name
Gideon gave to this memorial, Jehovah-shalom ([Jdg
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#024)) - The Lord peace. This is, (1..md)
The title of the Lord that spoke to him. Compare [Gen
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#013.md). The same that is the Lord our
righteousness is our peace ([Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014).md), our reconciler and so our
Saviour. Or, (2.) The substance of what he said to him: "The Lord spoke
peace, and created that fruit of the lips, bade me be easy when I was in
that agitation." Or, (3.) A prayer grounded upon what he had said, so
the margin understands it: The Lord send peace, that is, rest from the
present trouble, for still the public welfare lay nearest his heart.

[Judges 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jdg 6:25</span></span>

Here, I. Orders are given to Gideon to begin his government with the
reformation of his father's house, [Jdg
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#025.md), [Jdg
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#026.md). A correspondence being settled
between God and Gideon, by the appearance of the angel to him, it was
kept up in another way; the same night after he had seen God, when he
was full of thoughts concerning what had passed, which probably he had
not yet communicated to any, The Lord said unto him in a dream, Do so
and so. Note, God's visits, if gratefully received, shall be graciously
repeated. Bid God welcome, and he will come again. Gideon is appointed,
1. To throw down Baal's altar, which it seems hi father had, either for
his own house or perhaps for the whole town. See the power of God's
grace, that he could raise up a reformer, and the condescensions of his
grace, that he would raise up a deliverer, out of the family of one that
was a ring-leader in idolatry. But Gideon must not now think it enough
not to worship at that altar, which we charitably hope he had not done,
but he must throw it down; not consecrate the same altar to God (tit is
bishop Hall's observation), but utterly demolish it. God first commands
down the monuments of superstition, and then enjoins his own service. He
must likewise cut down the grove that was by it, the plantation of young
trees, designed to beautify the place. The learned bishop Patrick, by
the grove, understands the image in the grove, probably the image of
Ashtaroth (for the word for a grove is Ashereh), which stood upon or
close by the altar. 2. The erect an altar to God, to Jehovah his God,
which probably was to be notified by an inscription upon the altar to
that purport - to Jehovah, Gideon's God, or Israel's. It would have been
an improper thing for him to build an altar, even to the God of Israel,
especially for burnt-offering and sacrifice, and would have been
construed into a contempt of the altar at Shiloh, if God, who has not
tied up himself to his own laws, had not bidden him to do it. But now it
was his duty and honour to be thus employed. God directs him to the
place where he should build it, on the top of the rock, perhaps in the
same place in which the angel had appeared to him, near to the altar he
had already built: and he must not do it in a hurry, but with the
decency that became a religious action (in an orderly manner, as it is
in the margin), according to the ancient law for altars raised on
particular occasions, that they must be of earth not of hewn stone. The
word here used for the rock on which the altar was to be built signifies
a fortress, or strong-hold, erected, some think, to secure them from the
Midianites; if so, it was no security while the altar of Baal was so
near it, but it was effectually fortified when an altar to the Lord was
built on the top of it, for that is the best defence upon our glory. On
this altar, (1.) He was to offer sacrifice. Two bullocks he must offer:
his father's young bullock, and the second bullock of seven years old,
so it should rather be read, not even the second as we read it. The
former, we may suppose, he was to offer for himself, the latter for the
sins of the people whom he was to deliver. It was requisite he should
thus make peace with God, before he made war on Midian. Till sin be
pardoned through the great sacrifice, no good is to be expected. These
bullocks, it is supposed, were intended for sacrifices on the altar of
Baal, but were now converted to a better use. Thus, when the strong man
armed is overcome and dispossessed, the stronger than he divides the
spoil, seizes that for himself which was prepared for Baal. Let him come
whose right it is, and give it to him. (2.) Ball's grove, or image, or
whatever it was that was the sanctity or beauty of his altar, must not
only be burnt, but must be used as fuel for God's altar, to signify not
only that whatever sets up itself in opposition to God shall be
destroyed, but that the justice of God will be glorified in its
destruction. God ordered Gideon to do this, \[1.\] To try his zeal for
religion, which it was necessary he should give proofs of before he took
the field, to give proof of his valour there. \[2.\] That some steps
might hereby to taken towards Israel's reformation, which must prepare
the way for their deliverance. Sin, the cause, must be taken away, else
how should the trouble, which was but the effect, come to an end? And it
might be hoped that this example of Gideon's, who was now shortly to
appear so great a man, would be followed by the rest of the cities and
tribes, and the destruction of this one altar of Baal would be the
destruction of many.

II\. Gideon was obedient to the heavenly vision, [Jdg
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#027.md). He that was to command the
Israel of God must be subject to the God of Israel, without disputing,
and, as a type of Christ, must first save his people from their sins,
and then save them from their enemies. 1. He had servants of his own,
whom he could confide in, who, we may suppose, like him, had kept their
integrity, and had not bowed the knee to Baal, and therefore were
forward to assist him in destroying the altar of Baal. 2. He did not
scruple taking his father's bullock and offering it to God without his
father's consent, because God, who expressly commanded him to do so, had
a better title to it than his father had, and it was the greatest real
kindness he could do to his father to prevent his sin. 3. He expected to
incur the displeasure of his father's household by it, and the ill-will
of his neighbours, yet he did it, remembering how much it was Levi's
praise that, in the cause of God, he said to his father and mother, I
have not seen him, [Deu 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#009.md). And,
while he was sure of the favour of God, he feared not the anger of men;
he that bade him do it would bear him out. Yet, 4. Though he feared not
their resentment when it was done, to prevent their resistance in the
doing of it he prudently chose to do it by night, that he might not be
disturbed in these sacred actions. And some think it was the same night
in which God spoke to him to do it, and that, as soon as ever he had
received the orders, he immediately applied himself to the execution of
them, and finished before morning.

III\. He was brought into peril of his life for doing it, [Jdg
6:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#028.md). 1. It was soon discovered
what was done. Gideon, when he had gone through with the business, did
not desire the concealment of it, nor could it be hid, for the men of
the city rose early in the morning, as it should seem, to say their
matins at Baal's altar, and so to begin the day with their god, such a
one as he was, a shame to those who say the true God is their God, and
yet, in the morning, direct no prayer to him, nor look up. 2. It was
soon discovered who had done it. Strict enquiry was made. Gideon was
known to be disaffected to the worship of Baal, which brought him into
suspicion, and positive proof immediately came against him: "Gideon, no
doubt, has done this thing." 3. Gideon being found guilty of the fact,
to such a pitch of impiety had these degenerate Israelites arrived that
they take it for law he must die for the same, and require his own
father (who, by patronising their idolatry, had given them too much
cause to expect he would comply with them herein) to deliver him up:
Bring out thy son, that he may die. Be astonished, O heavens! at this,
and tremble, O earth! By the law of God the worshippers of Baal were to
die, but these wicked men impiously turn the penalty upon the
worshippers of the God of Israel. How prodigiously mad were they upon
their idols! Was it not enough to offer the choicest of their bullocks
to Baal, but must the bravest youth of their city fall as a sacrifice to
that dunghill-deity, when they pretended he was provoked? How soon will
idolaters become persecutors!

IV\. He was rescued out of the hands of his persecutors by his own
father, [Jdg 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#031.md).

1\. There were those that stood against Gideon, that not only appeared
at the first to make a demand, but insisted on it, and would have him
put to death. Notwithstanding the heavy judgments they were at this time
under for their idolatry, yet they hated to be reformed, and walked
contrary to God even when he was walking contrary to them.

2\. Yet then Joash stood for him; he was one of the chief men of the
city. Those that have power may do a great deal for the protection of an
honest man and an honest cause, and when they so use their power they
are ministers of God for good.

(1.) This Joash had patronised Baal's altar, yet now protects him that
had destroyed it, \[1.\] Out of natural affection to his son, and
perhaps a particular esteem for him as a virtuous, valiant, valuable,
young man, and never the worse for not joining with him in the worship
of Baal. Many that have not courage enough to keep their integrity
themselves yet have so much conscience left as makes them love and
esteem those that do. If Joash had a kindness for Baal, yet he had a
greater kindness for his son. Or, \[2.\] Out of a care for the public
peace. The mob grew riotous, and, he feared, would grow more so, and
therefore, as some think, he bestirred himself to repress the tumult:
"Let it be left to the judges; it is not for you to pass sentence upon
any man;" he that offers it, let him be put to death: he means not as an
idolater, but as a disturber of the peace, and the mover of sedition.
Under this same colour Paul was rescued at Ephesus from those that were
as zealous for Diana as these were for Baal, [Act
19:40](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#040.md). Or, \[3.\] Out of a conviction
that Gideon had done well. His son, perhaps, had reasoned with him, or
God, who has all hearts in his hands, had secretly and effectually
influenced him to appear thus against the advocates for Baal, though he
had complied with them formerly in the worship of Baal. Note, It is good
to appear for God when we are called to it, though there be few or none
to second us, because God can incline the hearts of those to stand by us
from whom we little expect assistance. Let us do our duty, and then
trust God with our safety.

(2.) Two things Joash urges: - \[1.\] That it was absurd for them to
plead for Baal. "Will you that are Israelites, the worshippers of the
one only living and true God, plead for Baal, a false god? Will you be
so sottish, so senseless? Those whose fathers' god Baal was, and who
never knew any other, are more excusable in pleading for him than you
are, that are in covenant with Jehovah, and have been trained up in the
knowledge of him. You that have smarted so much for worshipping Baal,
and have brought all this mischief and calamity upon yourselves by it,
will you yet plead for Baal?" Note, It is bad to commit sin, but it is
great wickedness indeed to plead for it, especially to plead for Baal,
that idol, whatever it is, which possesses that room in the heart which
God should have. \[2.\] That it was needless for them to plead for Baal.
If he were not a god, as was pretended, they could have nothing to say
for him; if he were, he was able to plead for himself, as the God of
Israel had often done by fire from heaven, or some other judgment
against those who put contempt upon him. Here is a fair challenge to
Baal to do either good or evil, and the result convinced his worshippers
of their folly in praying to one to help them that could not avenge
himself; after this Gideon remarkably prospered, and thereby it appeared
how unable Baal was to maintain his own cause.

(3.) Gideon's father hereupon gave him a new name ([Jdg
6:32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#032).md); he called him Jerubbaal: "Let
Baal plead; let him plead against him if he can; if he have any thing to
say for himself against his destroyer, let him say it." This name was a
standing defiance to Baal: "Now that Gideon is taking up arms against
the Midianites that worship Baal, let him defend his worshippers if he
can." It likewise gave honour to Gideon (a sworn enemy to that great
usurper, and that had carried the day against him), that encouragement
to his soldiers, that they fought under one that fought for God against
this great competitor with him for the throne. It is the probable
conjecture of the learned that that Jerombalus whom Sanchoniathon (one
of the most ancient of all the heathen writers) speaks of as a priest of
the god Jao (a corruption of the name Jehovah), and one to whom he was
indebted for a great deal of knowledge, was this Jerubbaal. He is called
Jerubbesheth ([Sa2 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#012).md), Baal, a
lord, being fitly turned into Besheth, shame.

[Judges 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jdg 6:33</span></span>

Here we have, I. The descent which the enemies of Israel made upon them,
[Jdg 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#033.md). A vast number of
Midianites, Amalekites, and Arabians, got together, and came over
Jordan, none either caring or daring to guard that important and
advantageous pass against them, and they made their headquarters in the
valley of Jezreel, in the heart of Manasseh's tribe, not far from
Gideon's city. Some think that the notice they had of Gideon's
destroying Baal's altar brought them over, and that they came to plead
for Baal and to make that a pretence for quarrelling with Israel; but it
is more likely that it was now harvest-time, when they had been wont
each year to make such a visit as this ([Jdg
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#003).md), and that they were expected when
Gideon was threshing, [Jdg 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#011.md). God
raised up Gideon to be ready against this terrible blow came. Their
success so many years in these incursions, the little opposition they
had met with and the great booty they had carried off, made them now
both very eager and very confident. But it proved that the measure of
their iniquity was full and the year of recompence had come; they must
now make an end to spoil and must be spoiled, and they are gathered as
sheaves to the floor ([Mic 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#012.md), [Mic
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#013).md), for Gideon to thresh.

II\. The preparation which Gideon makes to attack them in their camp,
[Jdg 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#034.md), [Jdg
6:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#035.md). 1. God by his Spirit put life
into Gideon: The Spirit of the Lord clothes Gideon (so the word is),
clothed him as a robe, to put honour upon him, clothed him as a coat of
mail, to put defence upon him. Those are well clad that are thus
clothed. A spirit of fortitude from before the Lord clothed Gideon; so
the Chaldee. He was of himself a mighty man of valour; yet personal
strength and courage, though vigorously exerted, would not suffice for
this great action; he must have the armour of God upon him, and this is
what he must depend upon: The Spirit of the Lord clothed him in an
extraordinary manner. Whom God calls to his work he will qualify and
animate for it. 2. Gideon with his trumpet put life into his neighbours,
God working with him; he blew a trumpet, to call in volunteers, and more
came in than perhaps he expected. (1.) The men of Abiezer, though lately
enraged against him for throwing down the altar of Baal, and though they
had condemned him to death as a criminal, were now convinced of their
error, bravely came in to his assistance, and submitted to him as their
general: Abiezer was gathered after him, [Jdg
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#034.md). So suddenly can God turn the
hearts even of idolaters and persecutors. (2.) Distant tribes, even
Asher and Naphtali, which lay most remote, though strangers to him,
obeyed his summons, and sent him in the best of their forces, [Jdg
6:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#035.md). Though they lay furthest from
the danger, yet, considering that if their neighbours were over-run by
the Midianites their own turn would be next, they were forward to join
against a common enemy.

III\. The signs which God gratified him with, for the confirming both of
his own faith and that of his followers; and perhaps it was more for
their sakes than for his own that he desired them. Or, perhaps, he
desired by these to be satisfied whether this was the time of his
conquering the Midianites, or whether he was to wait for some other
opportunity. Observe, 1. His request for a sign ([Jdg
6:36](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#036.md), [Jdg
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#037).md): "Let me by this know that thou
wilt save Israel by my hand, let a fleece of wool, spread in the open
air, be wet with the dew, and let the ground about it be dry." The
purport of this is, Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief. He found his
own faith weak and wavering, and therefore begged of God by this sign to
perfect what was lacking in it. We may suppose that God, who intended to
give him these signs, for the glorifying of his own power and goodness,
put it into his heart to ask them. Yet, when he repeated his request for
a second sign, the reverse of the former, he did it with a very humble
apology, deprecating God's displeasure, because it looked so like a
peevish humoursome distrust of God and dissatisfaction with the many
assurances he had already given him ([Jdg
6:39](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#039).md): Let not thy anger be hot
against me. Though he took the boldness to ask another sign, yet he did
it with such fear and trembling as showed that the familiarity God had
graciously admitted him to did not breed any contempt of God's glory,
nor presumption on God's goodness. Abraham had given him an example of
this, when God gave him leave to be very free with him ([Gen
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#030.md), [Gen
18:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#032).md), O let not the Lord be angry,
and I will speak. God's favour must be sought with great reverence, a
due sense of our distance, and a religious fear of his wrath. 2. God's
gracious grant of his request. See how tender God is of true believers
though they be weak, and how ready to condescend to their infirmities,
that the bruised reed may not be broken nor the smoking flax quenched.
Gideon would have the fleece wet and the ground dry; but then, lest any
should object, "It is natural for wool, if ever so little moisture fall,
to drink it in and retain it, and therefore there was nothing
extraordinary in this," though the quantity wrung out was sufficient to
obviate such an objection, yet he desires that next night the ground
might be wet and the fleece dry, and it is done, so willing is God to
give to the heirs of promise strong consolation ([Heb
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#017.md), [Heb
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018).md), even by two immutable things.
He suffers himself, not only to be prevailed with by their
importunities, but even to be prescribed to by their doubts and
dissatisfactions. These signs were, (1.) Truly miraculous, and therefore
abundantly serving to confirm his commission. It is said of the dew that
it is from the Lord, and tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons
of men ([Mic 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007).md); and yet God here in
this matter hearkened to the voice of a man; as to Joshua, in directing
the course of the sun, so to Gideon in directing that of the dew, by
which it appears that it falls not by chance, but by providence. The
latter sign inverted the former, and, to please Gideon, it was wrought
backward and forward, whence Dr. Fuller observes that heaven's real
miracles will endure turning, being inside and outside both alike. (2.)
Very significant. He and his men were going to engage the Midianites;
could God distinguish between a small fleece of Israel and the vast
floor of Midian? Yes, by this he is made to know that he can. Is Gideon
desirous that the dew of divine grace might descend upon himself in
particular? He sees the fleece wet with dew to assure him of it. Does he
desire that God will be as the dew to all Israel? Behold, all the ground
is wet. Some make this fleece an emblem of the Jewish nation, which,
when time was, was wet with the dew of God's word and ordinances, while
the rest of the world was dry; but since the rejection of Christ and his
gospel they are dry as the heath in the wilderness, while the nations
about are as a watered garden.
