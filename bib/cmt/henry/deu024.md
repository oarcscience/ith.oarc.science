[Deuteronomy 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 24:1</span></span>

This is that permission which the Pharisees erroneously referred to as a
precept, [Mat 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#007.md), Moses commanded to
give a writing of divorcement. It was not so; our Saviour told them that
he only suffered it because of the hardness of their hearts, lest, if
they had not had liberty to divorce their wives, they should have ruled
them with rigour, and it may be, have been the death of them. It is
probable that divorces were in use before (they are taken for granted,
[Lev 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#014).md), and Moses thought it
needful here to give some rules concerning them. 1. That a man might not
divorce his wife unless he found some uncleanness in her, [Deu
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001.md). It was not sufficient to say
that he did not like her, or that he liked another better, but he must
show cause for his dislike; something that made her disagreeable and
unpleasant to him, though it might not make her so to another. This
uncleanness must mean something less than adultery; for, for that, she
was to die; and less than the suspicion of it, for in that case he might
give her the waters of jealousy; but it means either a light carriage,
or a cross froward disposition, or some loathsome sore or disease; nay,
some of the Jewish writers suppose that an offensive breath might be a
just ground for divorce. Whatever is meant by it, doubtless it was
something considerable; so that their modern doctors erred who allowed
divorce for every cause, though ever so trivial, [Mat
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#003.md). 2. That it must be done, not by
word of mouth, for that might be spoken hastily, but by writing, and
that put in due form, and solemnly declared, before witnesses, to be his
own act and deed, which was a work of time, and left room for
consideration, that it might not be done rashly. 3. That the husband
must give it into the hand of his wife, and send her away, which some
think obliged him to endow her and make provision for her, according to
her quality and such as might help to marry her again; and good reason
he should do this, since the cause of quarrel was not her fault, but her
infelicity. 4. That being divorced it was lawful for her to marry
another husband, [Deu 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#002.md). The
divorce had dissolved the bond of marriage as effectually as death could
dissolve it; so that she was as free to marry again as if her first
husband had been naturally dead. 5. That if her second husband died, or
divorced her, then still she might marry a third, but her first husband
should never take her again ([Deu
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#003.md), [Deu
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#004).md), which he might have done if she
had not married another; for by that act of her own she had perfectly
renounced him for ever, and, as to him was looked upon as defiled,
though not as to another person. The Jewish writers say that this was to
prevent a most vile and wicked practice which the Egyptians had of
changing wives; or perhaps it was intended to prevent men's rashness in
putting away their wives; for the wife that was divorced would be apt,
in revenge, to marry another immediately, and perhaps the husband that
divorced her, how much soever he though to better himself by another
choice, would find the next worse, and something in her more
disagreeable, so that he would wish for his first wife again. "No" (says
this law) "you shall not have her, you should have kept her when you had
her." Note, It is best to be content with such things as we have, since
changes made by discontent often prove for the worse. The uneasiness we
know is commonly better, though we are apt to think it worse, than that
which we do not know. By the strictness of this law God illustrates the
riches of his grace in his willingness to be reconciled to his people
that had gone a whoring from him. [Jer
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#001.md), Thou hast played the harlot with
many lovers, yet return again to me. For his thoughts and ways are above
ours.

[Deuteronomy 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 24:5</span></span>

Here is, I. Provision made for the preservation and confirmation of love
between new-married people, [Deu 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#005.md).
This fitly follows upon the laws concerning divorce, which would be
prevented if their affection to each other were well settled at first.
If the husband were much abroad from his wife the first year, his love
to her would be in danger of cooling, and of being drawn aside to others
whom he would meet with abroad; therefore his service to his country in
war, embassies, or other public business that would call him from home,
shall be dispensed with, that he may cheer up the wife that he has
taken. Note, 1. It is of great consequence that love be kept up between
husband and wife, and that every thing be very carefully avoided which
might make them strange one to another, especially at first; for in that
relation, where there is not the love that should be, there is an inlet
ready to abundance of guilt and grief. 2. One of the duties of that
relation is to cheer up one another under the cares and crosses that
happen, as helpers of each other's joy; for a cheerful heart does good
like a medicine.

II\. A law against man-stealing, [Deu
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#007.md). It was not death by the law of
Moses to steal cattle or goods; but to steal a child, or a weak and
simple man, or one that a man had in his power, and to make merchandize
of him, this was a capital crime, and could not be expiated, as other
thefts, by restitution - so much is a man better than a sheep, [Mat
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#012.md). It was a very heinous offence,
for, 1. It was robbing the public of one of its members. 2. It was
taking away a man's liberty, the liberty of a free-born Israelite, which
was next in value to his life. 3. It was driving a man out from the
inheritance of the land, to the privileges of which he was entitled, and
bidding him go serve other gods, as David complains against Saul, [Sa1
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#019.md).

III\. A memorandum concerning the leprosy, [Deu
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#008.md), [Deu
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#009.md). 1. The laws concerning it must
be carefully observed. The laws concerning it we had, [Lev
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#014.md). They are here said to be
commanded to the priests and Levites, and therefore are not repeated in
a discourse to the people; but the people are here charged, in case of
leprosy, to apply to the priest according to the law, and to abide by
his judgment, so far as it agreed with the law and the plain matter of
fact. The plague of leprosy being usually a particular mark of God's
displeasure for sin, he in whom the signs of it did appear ought not to
conceal it, nor cut out the signs of it, nor apply to the physician for
relief; but he must go to the priest, and follow his directions. Thus
those that feel their consciences under guilt and wrath must not cover
it, nor endeavour to shake off their convictions, but by repentance, and
prayer, and humble confession, take the appointed way to peace and
pardon. 2. The particular case of Miriam, who was smitten with leprosy
for quarrelling with Moses, must not be forgotten. It was an explication
of the law concerning the leprosy. Remember that, and, (1.) "Take heed
of sinning after the similitude of her transgression, by despising
dominions and speaking evil of dignities, lest you thereby bring upon
yourselves the same judgment." (2.) "If any of you be smitten with a
leprosy, expect not that the law should be dispensed with, nor think it
hard to be shut out of the camp and so made a spectacle; there is no
remedy: Miriam herself, though a prophetess and the sister of Moses, was
not exempted, but was forced to submit to this severe discipline when
she was under this divine rebuke." Thus David, Hezekiah, Peter, and
other great men, when they had sinned, humbled themselves, and took to
themselves shame and grief; let us not expect to be reconciled upon
easier terms.

IV\. Some necessary orders given about pledges for the security of money
lent. They are not forbidden to take such securities as would save the
lender from loss, and oblige the borrower to be honest; but, 1. They
must not take the millstone for a pledge ([Deu
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#006).md), for with that they ground the
corn that was to be bread for their families, or, if it were a public
mill, with it the miller got his livelihood; and so it forbids the
taking of any thing for a pledge by the want of which a man was in
danger of being undone. Consonant to this is the ancient common law of
England, which provides that no man be distrained of the utensils or
instruments of his trade or profession, as the axe of a carpenter, or
the books of a scholar, or beasts belonging to the plough, as long as
there are other beasts of which distress may be made (Coke, 1 Inst. fol.
47). This teaches us to consult the comfort and subsistence of others as
much as our own advantage. That creditor who cares not though his debtor
and his family starve, nor is at all concerned what become of them, so
he may but get his money or secure it, goes contrary, not only to the
law of Christ, but even to the law of Moses too. 2. They must not go
into the borrower's house to fetch the pledge, but must stand without,
and he must bring it, [Deu 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#010.md), [Deu
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#011). The borrower (says Solomon.md) is
servant to the lender; therefore lest the lender should abuse the
advantage he has against him, and improve it for his own interest, it is
provided that he shall take not what he pleases, but what the borrower
can best spare. A man's house is his castle, even the poor man's house
is so, and is here taken under the protection of the law. 3. That a poor
man's bed-clothes should never be taken for a pledge, [Deu
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#012.md), [Deu
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#013.md). This we had before, [Exo
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#026.md), [Exo
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#027.md). If they were taken in the
morning, they must be brought back again at night, which is in effect to
say that they must not be taken at all. "Let the poor debtor sleep in
his own raiment, and bless thee," that is, "pray for thee, and praise
God for thy kindness to him." Note, Poor debtors ought to be sensible
(more sensible than commonly they are) of the goodness of those
creditors that do not take all the advantage of the law against them,
and to repay their kindnesses by their prayers for them, when they are
not in a capacity to repay it in any other way. "Nay, thou shalt not
only have the prayers and good wishes of thy poor brother, but it shall
be righteousness to thee before the Lord thy God," that is, "It shall be
accepted and rewarded as an act of mercy to thy brother and obedience to
thy God, and an evidence of thy sincere conformity to the law. Though it
may be looked upon by men as an act of weakness to deliver up the
securities thou hast for thy debt, yet it shall be looked upon by thy
God as an act of goodness, which shall in no wise lose its reward."

[Deuteronomy 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 24:14</span></span>

Here, I. Masters are commanded to be just to their poor servants, [Deu
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#014.md), [Deu
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#015.md). 1. They must not oppress them,
by overloading them with work, by giving them undue and unreasonable
rebukes, or by withholding from them proper maintenance. A servant,
though a stranger to the commonwealth of Israel, must not be abused:
"For thou wast a bondman in the land where thou wast a stranger ([Deu
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#018).md), and thou knowest what a
grievous thing it is to be oppressed by a task-master, and therefore, in
tenderness to those that are servants and strangers, and in gratitude to
that God who set thee at liberty and settled thee in a country of thy
own, thou shalt not oppress a servant." Let not masters be tyrants to
their servants, for their Master is in heaven. See [Job
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#013.md). 2. They must be faithful and
punctual in paying them their wages: "At his day thou shalt give him his
hire, not only pay it in time, without further delay. As soon as he had
done his day's work, if he desire it, let him have his day's wages," as
those labourers ([Mat 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#008).md) when
evening had come. he that works by day-wages is supposed to live from
hand to mouth, and cannot have tomorrow's bread for his family till be
is paid for this day's labour. If the wages be withheld, (1.) It will be
grief to the servant, for, poor man, he sets his heart upon it,. or, as
the word is, he lifts up his soul to it, he is earnestly desirous of it,
as the reward of his work ([Job 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#002).md),
and depends upon it as the gift of God's providence for the maintenance
of his family. A compassionate master, though it should be somewhat
inconvenient to himself, would not disappoint the expectation of a poor
servant that was so fond to think of receiving his wages. But that is
not the worst. (2.) It will be guilt to the master. "The injured servant
will cry against thee to the Lord; since he has no one else to appeal
to, he will lodge his appeal in the court of heaven, and it will be sin
to thee." Or, if he do not complain, the cause will speak for itself,
the "hire of the labourers which is kept back by fraud will itself cry,"
[Jam 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#004.md). It is a greater sin than
most people think it is, and will be found so in the great day, to put
hardships upon poor servants, labourers, and workmen, that we employ.
God will do them right if men do not.

II\. Magistrates and judges are commanded to be just in their
administrations. 1. In those which we call pleas of the crown a standing
rule is here given, that the fathers shall not be put to death for the
children, nor the children for the fathers, [Deu
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#016.md). If the children make themselves
obnoxious to the law, let them suffer for it, but let not the parents
suffer either for them or with them; it is grief enough to them to see
their children suffer: if the parents be guilty, let them die for their
own sin; but though God, the sovereign Lord of life, sometimes visits
the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, especially the sin of
idolatry, and when he deals with nations in their national capacity, yet
he does not allow men to do so. Accordingly, we find Amaziah sparing the
children, even when the fathers were put to death for killing the king,
[Kg2 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#006.md). It was in an extraordinary
case, and no doubt by special direction from heaven, that Saul's sons
were put to death for his offence, and they died rather as sacrifices
than as malefactors, [Sa2 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#009.md), [Sa2
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#014.md). 2. In common pleas between
party and party, great care must be taken that none whose cause was just
should fare the worse for their weakness, nor for their being destitute
of friends, as strangers, fatherless, and widows ([Deu
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#017).md): "Thou shalt not pervert their
judgment, nor force them to give their very raiment for a pledge, by
defrauding them of their right." Judges must be advocates for those that
cannot speak for themselves and have no friends to speak for them.

III\. The rich are commanded to be kind and charitable to the poor. Many
ways they are ordered to be so by the law of Moses. The particular
instance of charity here prescribed is that they should not be greedy in
gathering in their corn, and grapes, and olives, so as to be afraid of
leaving any behind them, but be willing to overlook some, and let the
poor have the gleanings, v. 19-22. 1. "Say not, 'It is all my own, and
why should not I have it?' But learn a generous contempt of property in
small matters. One sheaf or two forgotten will make thee never the
poorer at the year's end, and it will do somebody good, if thou have it
not." 2. "Say not, 'What I give I will give, and know whom I give it to,
why should I leave it to be gathered by I know not whom, that will never
thank me.' But trust God's providence with the disposal of thy charity,
perhaps that will direct it to the most necessitous." Or, "Thou mayest
reasonably think it will come to the hands of the most industrious, that
are forward to seek and gather that which this law provides for them."
3. "Say not, 'What should the poor do with grapes and olives? It is
enough for them to have bread and water;' for, since they have the same
senses that the rich have, why should not they have some little share of
the delights of sense?" Boaz ordered handfuls of corn to be left on
purpose for Ruth, and God blessed him. All that is left is not lost.
