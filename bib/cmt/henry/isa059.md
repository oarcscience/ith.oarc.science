### [Isaiah Chapter 59](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 59:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have sin appearing exceedingly sinful, and grace
appearing exceedingly gracious; and, as what is here said of the
sinner's sin ([Isa 59:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007.md), [Isa
59:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#008).md) is applied to the general
corruption of mankind ([Rom 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#015).md), so
what is here said of a Redeemer ([Isa
59:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#020).md) is applied to Christ, [Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026.md). I. It is here charged upon this
people that they had themselves stopped the current of God's favours to
them, and the particular sins are specified which kept good things from
them ([Isa 59:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001).md). II. It is here
charged upon them that they had themselves procured the judgments of God
upon them, and they are told both what the judgments were which they had
brought upon their own heads ([Isa
59:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#009).md) and what the sins were which
provoked God to send those judgments ([Isa
59:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#012).md). III. It is here promised
that, notwithstanding this, God would work deliverance for them, purely
for his own name's sake ([Isa
59:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016).md), and would reserve mercy in
store for them and entail it upon them ([Isa
59:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#020.md), [Isa
59:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#021).md).

[Isaiah 59:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 59:1</span></span>

The prophet here rectifies the mistake of those who had been quarrelling
with God because they had not the deliverances wrought for them which
they had been often fasting and praying for, [Isa
58:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#003.md). Now here he shows,

I. That it was not owing to God. They had no reason to lay the fault
upon him that they were not saved out of the hands of their enemies;
for, 1. He was still as able to help as ever: His hand is not shortened,
his power is not at all lessened, straitened, or abridged. Whether we
consider the extent of his power or the efficacy of it, God can reach as
far as ever and with as strong a hand as ever. Note, The church's
salvation comes from the hand of God, and that has not waxed weak nor is
it at all shortened. Has the Lord's hand waxed short? (says God to
Moses, [Num 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#023).md). No, it has not; he
will not have it thought so. Neither length of time nor strength of
enemies, no, nor weakness of instruments, can shorten or straiten the
power of God, with which it is all one to save by many or by few. 2. He
was still as ready and willing to help as ever in answer to prayer: His
ear is not heavy, that it cannot hear. Though he has many prayers to
hear and answer, and though he has been long hearing prayer, yet he is
still as ready to hear prayer as ever. The prayer of the upright is as
much his delight as ever it was, and the promises which are pleaded and
put in suit in prayer are still yea and amen, inviolably sure. More is
implied than is expressed; not only his ear is not heavy, but he is
quick of hearing. Even before they call he answers, [Isa
65:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#024.md). If your prayers be not
answered, and the salvation we wait for be not wrought for us, it is not
because God is weary of hearing prayer, but because we are weary of
praying, not because his ear is heavy when we speak to him, but because
our ears are heavy when he speaks to us.

II\. That it was owing to themselves; they stood in their own light and
put a bar in their own door. God was coming towards them in ways of
mercy and they hindered him. Your iniquities have kept good things from
you, [Jer 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#025.md).

1\. See what mischief sin does. (1.) It hinders God's mercies from
coming down upon us; it is a partition wall that separates between us
and God. Notwithstanding the infinite distance that is between God and
man by nature, there was a correspondence settled between them, till sin
set them at variance, justly provoked God against man and unjustly
alienated man from God; thus it separates between them and God. "He is
your God, yours in profession, and therefore there is so much the more
malignity and mischievousness in sin, which separates between you and
him." Sin hides his face from us (which denotes great displeasure, [Deu
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#017).md); it provokes him in anger to
withdraw his gracious presence, to suspend the tokens of his favour and
the instances of his help; he hides his face, as refusing to be seen or
spoken with. See here sin in its colours, sin exceedingly sinful,
withdrawing the creature from his allegiance to his Creator; and see sin
in its consequences, sin exceedingly hurtful, separating us from God,
and so separating us not only from all good, but to all evil ([Deu
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#021).md), which is the very quintessence
of the curse. (2.) It hinders our prayers from coming up unto God; it
provokes him to hide his face, that he will not hear, as he has said,
[Isa 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015.md). If we regard iniquity in
our heart, if we indulge it and allow ourselves in it, God will not hear
our prayers, [Psa 66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018.md). We cannot
expect that he should countenance us while we go on to affront him.

2\. Now, to justify God in hiding his face from them, and proceeding in
his controversy with them, the prophet shows very largely, in the
following verses, how many and great their iniquities were, according to
the charge given him ([Isa 58:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001).md), to
show God's people their transgressions; and it is a black bill of
indictment that is here drawn up against them, consisting of many
particulars, any one of which was enough to separate between them and a
just and a holy God. Let us endeavour to reduce these articles of
impeachment to proper heads.

(1.) We must begin with their thoughts, for there all sin begins, and
thence it takes its rise: Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, [Isa
59:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007.md). Their imaginations are so, only
evil continually. Their projects and designs are so; they are
continually contriving some mischief or other, and how to compass the
gratification of some base lust ([Isa
59:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#004).md): They conceive mischief in their
fancy, purpose, counsel, and resolution (thus the embryo receives its
shape and life), and then they bring forth iniquity, put it in execution
when it is ripened for it. Though it is in pain perhaps that the
iniquity is brought forth, through the oppositions of Providences and
the checks of their own consciences, yet, when they have compassed their
wicked purpose, they look upon it with as much pride and pleasure as if
it were a man-child born into the world; thus, when lust has conceived,
it bringeth forth sin, [Jam 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#015.md). This
is called ([Isa 59:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#005).md) hatching the
cockatrice' egg and weaving the spider's web. See how the thoughts and
contrivances of wicked men are employed, and about what they set their
wits on work. \[1.\] At the best it is about that which is foolish and
frivolous. Their thoughts are vain, like weaving the spider's web, which
the poor silly animal takes a great deal of pains about, and, when all
is done, it is a weak insignificant thing, a reproach to the place where
it is, and which the besom sweeps away in an instant: such are the
thoughts which worldly men entertain themselves with, building castles
in the air, and pleasing themselves with imaginary satisfaction, like
the spider, which takes hold with her hands very finely ([Pro
30:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#028).md), but cannot keep her hold.
\[2.\] Too often it is about that which is malicious and spiteful. They
hatch the eggs of the cockatrice or adder, which are poisonous and
produce venomous creatures; such are the thoughts of the wicked who
delight in doing mischief. He that eats of their eggs (that is, he is in
danger of having some mischief or other done him), and that which is
crushed in order to be eaten of, or which begins to be hatched and you
promise yourself some useful fowl from it, breaks out into a viper,
which you meddle with at your peril. Happy are those that have least to
do with such men. Even the spider's web which they wove was woven with a
spiteful design to catch flies in and make a prey of them; for, rather
than not be doing mischief, they will play at small game.

(2.) Out of this abundance of wickedness in the heart their mouth
speaks, and yet it does not always speak out the wickedness that is
within, but, for the more effectually compassing the mischievous design,
it is dissembled and covered with much fair speech ([Isa
59:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#003).md): Your lips have spoken lies; and
again ([Isa 59:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#004).md), They speak lies,
pretending kindness where they intend the greatest mischief; or by
slanders and false accusations they blasted the credit and reputation of
those they had a spite to and so did them a real mischief unseen, and
perhaps by suborning witnesses against them took from them their estates
and lives; for a false tongue is sharp arrows, and coals of juniper, and
every thing that is mischievous. Your tongue has muttered perverseness.
When they could not, for shame, speak their malice against their
neighbours aloud, or durst not, for fear of being disproved and put to
confusion, they muttered it secretly. Backbiters are called whisperers.

(3.) Their actions were all of a piece with their thoughts and words.
They were guilty of shedding innocent blood, a crime of the most heinous
nature: Your hands are defiled with blood ([Isa
59:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#003).md); for blood is defiling; it
leaves an indelible stain of guilt upon the conscience, which nothing
but the blood of Christ can cleanse it from. Now was this a case of
surprise, or one that occurred when there was something of a force put
upon them; but ([Isa 59:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007).md) their feet
ran to this evil, naturally and eagerly, and, hurried on by the impetus
of their malice and revenge, they made haste to shed innocent blood, as
if they were afraid of losing an opportunity to do a barbarous thing,
[Pro 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#016.md); [Jer
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#017.md). Wasting and destruction are in
their paths. Wherever they go they carry mischief along with them, and
the tendency of their way is to lay waste and destroy, nor do they care
what havoc they make. Nor do they only thirst after blood, but with
other iniquities are their fingers defiled ([Isa
59:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#003).md); they wrong people in their
estates and make every thing their own that they can lay their hands on.
They trust in vanity ([Isa 59:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#004).md); they
depend upon their arts of cozenage to enrich themselves with, which will
prove vanity to them, and their deceiving others will but deceive
themselves. Their works, which they take so much pains about and have
their hearts so much upon, are all works of iniquity; their whole
business is one continued course of oppressions and vexations, and the
act of violence is in their hands, according to the arts of violence
that are in their heads and the thoughts of violence in their hearts.

(4.) No methods are taken to redress these grievances, and reform these
abuses ([Isa 59:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#004).md): None calls for
justice, none complains of the violation of the sacred laws of justice,
nor seeks to right those that suffer wrong or to get the laws put in
execution against vice and profaneness, and those lewd practices which
are the shame, and threaten to be the bane, of the nation. Note, When
justice is not done there is blame to be laid not only upon the
magistrates that should administer justice, but upon the people that
should call for it. Private persons ought to contribute to the public
good by discovering secret wickedness, and giving those an opportunity
to punish it that have the power of doing so in their hands; but it is
ill with a state when princes rule ill and the people love to have it
so. Truth is opposed, and there is not any that pleads for it, not any
that has the conscience and courage to appear in defence of an honest
cause, and confront a prosperous fraud and wrong. The way of peace is as
little regarded as the way of truth; they know it not, that is, they
never study the things that make for peace, no care is taken to prevent
or punish the breaches of the peace and to accommodate matters in
difference among neighbours; they are utter strangers to every thing
that looks quiet and peaceable, and affect that which is blustering and
turbulent. There is no judgment in their goings; they have not any sense
of justice in their dealings; it is a thing they make no account of at
all, but can easily break through all its fences if they stand in the
way of their malicious covetous designs.

(5.) In all this they act foolishly, very foolishly, and as much against
their interest as against reason and equity. Those that practise
iniquity trust in vanity, which will certainly deceive them, [Isa
59:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#004.md). Their webs, which they weave
with so much art and industry, shall not become garments, neither shall
they cover themselves, either for shelter or for ornament, with their
works, [Isa 59:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#006.md). They may do hurt to
others with their projects, but can never do any real service or
kindness to themselves by them. There is nothing to be got by sin, and
so it will appear when profit and loss come to be compared. Those paths
of iniquity are crooked paths ([Isa
59:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#008).md), which will perplex them, but
will never bring them to their journey's end; whoever go therein, though
they say that they shall have peace notwithstanding they go on, deceive
themselves; for they shall not know peace, as appears by the following
verses.

[Isaiah 59:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 59:9</span></span>

The scope of this paragraph is the same with that of the last, to show
that sin is the great mischief-maker; as it is that which keeps good
things from us, so it is that which brings evil things upon us. But as
there it is spoken by the prophet, in God's name, to the people, for
their conviction and humiliation, and that God might be justified when
he speaks and clear when he judges, so here it seems to be spoken by the
people to God, as an acknowledgment of that which was there told them
and an expression of their humble submission and subscription to the
justice and equity of God's proceedings against them. Their
uncircumcised hearts here seem to be humbled in some measure, and they
are brought to confess (the confession is at least extorted from them),
that God had justly walked contrary to them, because they had walked
contrary to him.

I. They acknowledge that God had contended with them and had walked
contrary to them. Their case was very deplorable, [Isa
59:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#009.md). 1. They were in distress,
trampled upon and oppressed by their enemies, unjustly dealt with, and
ruled with rigour; and God did not appear for them, to plead their just
and injured cause: "Judgment is far from us, neither does justice
overtake us, [Isa 59:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#009.md). Though, as to
our persecutors, we are sure that we have right on our side; and they
are the wrong-doers, yet we are not relieved, we are not righted. We
have not done justice to one another, and therefore God suffers our
enemies to deal thus unjustly with us, and we are as far as ever from
being restored to our right and recovering our property again.
Oppression is near us, and judgment is far from us. Our enemies are far
from giving our case its due consideration, but still hurry us on with
the violence of their oppressions, and justice does not overtake us, to
rescue us out of their hands." 2. Herein their expectations were sadly
disappointed, which made their case the more sad: "We wait for light as
those that wait for the morning, but behold obscurity; we cannot discern
the least dawning of the day of our deliverance. We look for judgment,
but there is none ([Isa 59:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#011).md);
neither God nor man appears for our succour; we look for salvation,
because God (we think) has promised it, and we have prayed for it with
fasting; we look for it as for brightness, but it is far off from us, as
far off as ever for aught we can perceive, and still we walk in
darkness; and the higher our expectations have been raised the sorer is
the disappointment." 3. They were quite at a loss what to do to help
themselves and were at their wits' end ([Isa
59:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#010).md): "We grope for the wall like
the blind; we see no way open for our relief, nor know which way to
expect it, or what to do in order to it." If we shut our eyes against
the light of divine truth, it is just with God to hide from our eyes the
things that belong to our peace; and, if we use not our eyes as we
should, it is just with him to let us be as if we had no eyes. Those
that will not see their duty shall not see their interest. Those whom
God has given up to a judicial blindness are strangely infatuated; they
stumble at noon-day as in the night; they see not either those dangers,
or those advantages, which all about them see. Quos Deus vult perdere,
eos dementat - God infatuates those whom he means to destroy. Those that
love darkness rather than light shall have their doom accordingly. 4.
They sunk into despair and were quite overwhelmed with grief, the marks
of which appeared in every man's countenance; they grew melancholy upon
it, shunned conversation, and affected solitude: We are in desolate
places as dead men. The state of the Jews in Babylon is represented by
dead and dry bones ([Eze 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#012).md) and
the explanation of the comparison there ([Isa
59:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#011).md) explains this text: Our hope is
lost; we are cut off for our parts. In this despair the sorrow and
anguish of some were loud and noisy: We roar like bears; the sorrow of
others was silent, and preyed more upon their spirits: "We mourn sore
like doves, like doves of the valleys; we mourn both for our iniquities
([Eze 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#016).md) and for our calamities."
Thus they owned that the hand of the Lord had gone out against them.

II\. They acknowledge that they had provoked God thus to contend with
them, that he had done right, for they had done wickedly, [Isa
59:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#012.md). 1. They owned that they had
sinned, and that to this day they were in a great trespass, as Ezra
speaks ([Ezr 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#010).md): "Our
transgressions are with us; the guilt of them is upon us, the power of
them prevails among us, we are not yet reformed, nor have we parted with
our sins, though they have done so much mischief. Nay, our
transgressions are multiplied; they are more numerous and more heinous
than they have been formerly. Look which way we will, we cannot look off
them; all places, all orders and degrees of men, are infected. The sense
of our transgression is with us, as David said, My sin is ever before
me; it is too plain to be denied or concealed, too bad to be excused or
palliated. God is a witness to them: They are multiplied before thee, in
thy sight, under thy eye. We are witnesses against ourselves: As for our
iniquities, we know them, though we may have foolishly endeavoured to
cover them. Nay, they themselves are witnesses: Our sins stare us in the
face and testify against us, so many have they been and so deeply
aggravated." 2. They owned the great evil and malignity of sin, of their
sin; it is transgressing and lying against the Lord, v. 13. The sins of
those that profess themselves God's people, and bear his name, are upon
this account worse than the sins of others, that in transgressing they
lie against the Lord, they falsely accuse him, they misrepresent and
belie him, as if he had dealt hardly and unfairly with them; or they
perfidiously break covenant with him and falsify their most sacred and
solemn engagements to him, which is lying against him: it is departing
away from our God, to whom we are bound as our God and to whom we ought
to cleave with purpose of heart; from him we have departed, as the
rebellious subject from his allegiance to his rightful prince, and the
adulterous wife from the guide of her youth and the covenant of her God.
3. They owned that there was a general decay of moral honesty; and it is
not strange that those who were false to their God were unfaithful to
one another. They spoke oppression, declared openly for that, though it
was a revolt from their God and a revolt from the truth, by the sacred
bonds of which we should always be tied and held fast. They conceived
and uttered words of falsehood. Many ill thing is conceived in the mind,
yet is prudently stifled there, and not suffered to go any further; but
these sinners were so impudent, so daring, that whatever wickedness they
conceived, they gave it an imprimatur - a sanction, and made no
difficulty of publishing it. To think an ill thing is bad, but to say it
is much worse. Many a word of falsehood is uttered in haste, for want of
consideration; but these were conceived and uttered, were uttered -
deliberately and of malice prepense. They were words of falsehood, and
yet they are said to be uttered from the heart, because, though they
differed from the real sentiments of the heart and therefore were words
of falsehood, yet they agreed with the malice and wickedness of the
heart, and were the natural language of that; it was a double heart,
[Psa 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#002.md). Those who by the grace of
God kept themselves free from these enormous crimes yet put themselves
into the confession of sin, because members of that nation which was
generally thus corrupted. 4. They owned that that was not done which
might have been done to reform the land and to amend what was amiss,
[Isa 59:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#014.md). "Judgment, that should go
forward, and bear down the opposition that is made to it, that should
run in its course like a river, like a mighty stream, is turned away
backward, a contrary course. The administration of justice has become
but a cover to the greatest injustice. Judgment, that should check the
proceedings of fraud and violence, is driven back, and so they go on
triumphantly. Justice stands afar off, even from our courts of
judicature, which are so crowded with the patrons of oppression that
equity cannot enter, cannot have admission into the court, cannot be
heard, or at least will not be heeded. Equity enters not into the
unrighteous decrees which they decree, [Isa
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#001.md). Truth is fallen in the street,
and there she may lie to be trampled upon by every foot of pride, and
she has never a friend that will lend a hand to help her up; yea, truth
fails in common conversation, and in dealings between man and man, so
that one knows not whom to believe nor whom to trust." 5. They owned
that there was a prevailing enmity in men's minds to those that were
good: He that does evil goes unpunished, but he that departs from evil
makes himself a prey to those beasts of prey that were before described.
It is crime enough with them for a man not to do as they do, and they
treat him as an enemy who will not partake with them in their
wickedness. He that departs from evil is accounted mad; so the margin
reads. Sober singularity is branded as folly, and he is thought next
door to a madman who swims against the stream that runs so strongly. 6.
They owned that all this could not but be very displeasing to the God of
heaven. The evil was done in his sight. They knew very well, though they
were not willing to acknowledge it, that the Lord saw it; though it was
done secretly, and gilded over with specious pretences, yet it could not
be concealed from his all-seeing eye. All the wickedness that is in the
world is naked and open before the eyes of God; and, as he is of quicker
eyes than not to see iniquity, so he is of purer eyes than to behold it
with the least approbation or allowance. He saw it, and it displeased
him, though it was among his own professing people that he saw it. It
was evil in his eyes; he saw the sinfulness of all this sin, and that
which was most offensive to him was that there was no judgment, no
reformation; had he seen any signs of repentance, though the sin
displeased him, he would soon have been reconciled to the sinners upon
their returning from their evil way. Then the sin of a nation becomes
national, and brings public judgments, when it is not restrained by
public justice.

[Isaiah 59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 59:16</span></span>

How sin abounded we have read, to our great amazement, in the former
part of the chapter; how grace does much more abound we read in these
verses. And, as sin took occasion from the commandment to become more
exceedingly sinful, so grace took occasion from the transgression of the
commandment to appear more exceedingly gracious. Observe,

I. Why God wrought salvation for this provoking people, notwithstanding
their provocations. It was purely for his own name's sake; because there
was nothing in them either to bring it about, or to induce him to bring
it about for them, no merit to deserve it, no might to effect it, he
would do it himself, would be exalted in his own strength, for his own
glory.

1\. He took notice of their weakness and wickedness: He saw that there
was no man that would do any thing for the support of the bleeding cause
of religion and virtue among them, not a man that would execute judgment
([Jer 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001).md), that would bestir himself
in a work of reformation; those that complained of the badness of the
times had not zeal and courage enough to appear and act against it;
there was a universal corruption of manners, and nothing done to stem
the tide; most were wicked, and those that were not so were yet weak,
and durst not attempt any thing in opposition to the wickedness of the
wicked. There was no intercessor, either none to intercede with God, to
stand in the gap by prayer to turn away his wrath (it would have pleased
him to be thus met, and he wondered that he was not), or, rather, none
to interpose for the support of justice and truth, which were trampled
upon and run down ([Isa 59:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#014).md), no
advocate to speak a good word for those who were made a prey of because
they kept their integrity, [Isa 59:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#015.md).
They complained that God did not appear for them ([Isa
58:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#003).md); but God with much more reason
complains that they did nothing for themselves, intimating how ready he
would have been to do them good if he had found among them the least
motion towards a reformation.

2\. He engaged his own strength and righteousness for them. They shall
be saved, notwithstanding all this; and, (1.) Because they have no
strength of their own, nor any active men that will set to it in good
earnest to redress the grievances either of their iniquities or of their
calamities, therefore his own arm shall bring salvation to him, to his
people, or to him whom he would raise up to be the deliverer, Christ,
the power of God and arm of the Lord, that man of his right hand whom he
made strong for himself. The work of reformation (that is the first and
principal article of the salvation) shall be wrought by the immediate
influences of the divine grace on men's consciences. Since magistrates
and societies for reformation fail of doing their part, one will not do
justice nor the other call for it, God will let them know that he can do
it without them when his time shall come thus to prepare his people for
mercy, and then the work of deliverance shall be wrought by the
immediate operations of the divine Providence on men's affections and
affairs. When God stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, and brought his people
out of Babylon, not by might, nor by power, but by the Spirit of the
Lord of hosts, then his own arm, which is never shortened, brought
salvation. (2.) Because they have no righteousness of their own to merit
these favours, and to which God might have an eye in working for them,
therefore his own righteousness sustained him and bore him out in it.
Divine justice, which by their sins they had armed against them, through
grace appears for them. Though they can expect no favour as due to them,
yet he will be just to himself, to his own purpose and promise, and
covenant with his people: he will, in righteousness, punish the enemies
of his people; see [Deu 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#005.md). Not for
thy righteousness, but for the wickedness of these nations they are
driven out. In our redemption by Christ, since we had no righteousness
of our own to produce, on which God might proceed in favour to us, he
brought in a righteousness by the merit and meditation of his own Son
(it is called the righteousness which is of God by faith, [Phi
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#009).md), and this righteousness sustained
him, and bore him out in all his favours to us, notwithstanding our
provocations. He put on righteousness as a breast-plate, securing his
own honour, as a breast-plate does the vitals, in all his proceedings,
by the justice and equity of them; and then he put a helmet of salvation
upon his head; so sure is he to effect the salvation he intends that he
takes salvation itself for his helmet, which therefore must needs be
impenetrable, and in which he appears very illustrious, formidable in
the eyes of his enemies and amiable in the eyes of his friends. When
righteousness is his coat of arms, salvation is his crest. In allusion
to this, among the pieces of a Christian's armour we find the
breast-plate of righteousness, and for a helmet the hope of salvation
([Eph 6:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#014.md); [Th1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008).md), and it is called the armour of
God, because he wore it first and so fitted it for us. (3.) Because they
have no spirit or zeal to do any thing for themselves, God will put on
the garments of vengeance for clothing, and clothe himself with zeal as
a cloak; he will make his justice upon the enemies of his church and
people, and his jealousy for his own glory and the honour of religion
and virtue among men, to appear evident and conspicuous in the eye of
the world; and in these he will show himself great, as a man shows
himself in his rich attire or in the distinguishing habit of his office.
If men be not zealous against sin, God will, and will take vengeance on
it for all the injury it has done to his honour and his people's
welfare; and this was the business of Christ in the world, to take away
sin and be revenged on it.

II\. What the salvation is that shall be wrought out by the
righteousness and strength of God himself.

1\. There shall be a present temporal salvation wrought out for the Jews
in Babylon, or elsewhere in distress and captivity. This is promised
([Isa 59:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#018.md), [Isa
59:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#019).md) as a type of something further.
When God's time shall come he will do his own work, though those fail
that should forward it. It is here promised, (1.) That God will reckon
with his enemies and will render to them according to their deeds, to
the enemies of his people abroad, that have oppressed them, to the
enemies of justice and truth at home, that have oppressed them, for they
also are God's enemies; and, when the day of vengeance shall have come,
he will deal with both as they have deserved, according to retribution
(so the word is), the law of retributions ([Rev
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#010).md), or according to former
retributions; as he has rendered to his enemies formerly, accordingly he
will now repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; his
fury shall not exceed the rules of justice, as men's fury commonly does.
Even to the islands, that lie most remote, if they have appeared against
him, he will repay recompence; for his hand shall find out all his
enemies ([Psa 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#008).md), and his arrows
reach them. Though God's people have behaved so ill that they do not
deserve to be delivered, yet his enemies behave so much worse that they
do deserve to be destroyed. (2.) That, whatever attempts the enemies of
God's people may afterwards make upon them to disturb their peace, they
shall be baffled and brought to nought: When the enemy shall come in
like a flood, like a high spring-tide, or a land-flood, which threaten
to bear down all before them without control, then the Spirit of the
Lord by some secret undiscerned power shall lift up a standard against
him, and so (as the margin reads it) put him to flight. He that has
delivered will still deliver. When God's people are weak and helpless,
and have no standard to lift up against the invading power, God will
give a banner to those that fear him ([Psa
60:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#004).md), will by his Spirit lift up a
standard, which will draw multitudes together to appear on the church's
behalf. Some read it, He shall come (the name of the Lord, and his
glory, before foreseen of the Messiah promised) like a straight river,
the Spirit of the Lord lifting him up for an ensign. Christ by the
preaching of his gospel shall cover the earth with the knowledge of God
as with the waters of a flood, the Spirit of the Lord setting up Christ
as a standard to the Gentiles, [Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010). (3..md) That all this should
redound to the glory of God and the advancement of religion in the world
([Isa 59:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#019).md): So shall they fear the
name of the Lord and his glory in all nations that lie eastward or
westward. The deliverance of the Jews out of captivity, and the
destruction brought on their oppressors, would awaken multitudes to
enquire concerning the God of Israel, and induce them to serve and
worship him and enlist themselves under the standard which the Spirit of
the Lord shall lift up. God's appearances for his church shall occasion
the accession of many to it. This had its full accomplishment in gospel
times, when many came from the east and west, to fill up the places of
the children of the kingdom that were cast out, when there were set up
eastern and western churches, [Mat
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#011.md).

2\. There shall be a more glorious salvation wrought out by the Messiah
in the fulness of time, which salvation all the prophets, upon all
occasions, had in view. We have here the two great promises relating to
that salvation: -

(1.) That the Son of God shall come to us to be our Redeemer ([Isa
59:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#020).md): Thy Redeemer shall come; it is
applied to Christ, [Rom 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#026.md). There
shall come the deliverer. The coming of Christ as the Redeemer is the
summary of all the promises both of the Old and New Testament, and this
was the redemption in Jerusalem which the believing Jews looked for,
[Luk 2:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#038.md). Christ is our Goel, our
next kinsman, that redeems both the person and the estate of the poor
debtor. Observe, \[1.\] The place where this Redeemer shall appear: He
shall come to Zion, for there, on that holy hill, the Lord would set him
up as his King, [Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md). In Zion the
chief corner-stone was to be laid, [Pe1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006.md). He came to his temple there, [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md). There salvation was to be placed
([Isa 46:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#013).md), for thence the law was
to go forth, [Isa 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003.md). Zion was a type
of the gospel church, for which the Redeemer acts in all his
appearances: The Redeemer shall come for the sake of Zion; so the
Septuagint reads it. \[2.\] The persons that shall have the comfort of
the Redeemer's coming, that shall then lift up their heads, knowing that
their redemption draws nigh. He shall come to those that turn from the
ungodliness in Jacob, to those that are in Jacob, to the praying seed of
Jacob, in answer to their prayers; yet not to all that are in Jacob,
that are within the pale of the visible church, but to those only that
turn from transgression, that repent, and reform, and forsake those sins
which Christ came to redeem them from. The sinners in Zion will fare
never the better for the Redeemer's coming to Zion if they go on still
in their trespasses.

(2.) That the Spirit of God shall come to us to be our sanctifier, [Isa
59:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#021.md). In the Redeemer there was a new
covenant made with us a covenant of promises; and this is the great and
comprehensive promise of that covenant, that God will give and continue
his word and Spirit to his church and people throughout all generations.
God's giving the Spirit to those that ask him includes the giving of
them all good things, [Luk 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#013.md); [Mat
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#011.md). This covenant is here said to be
made with them, that is, with those that turn from transgression; for
those that cease to do evil shall be taught to do well. But the promise
is made to a single person - My Spirit that is upon thee, being directed
either, \[1.\] To Christ as the head of the church, who received that he
might give. The Spirit promised to the church was first upon him, and
from his head that precious ointment descended to the skirts of his
garments; and the word of the gospel was first put into his mouth; for
it began to be spoken by the Lord. And all believers are his seed, in
whom he prolongs his days, [Isa 53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md).
Or, \[2.\] To the church; and so it is a promise of the continuance and
perpetuity of the church in the world to the end of time, parallel to
those promises that the throne and seed of Christ shall endure for ever,
[Psa 89:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#029.md), [Psa
89:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#036.md); [Psa
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#030.md). Observe, First, How the church
shall be kept up, in a succession, as the world of mankind is kept up,
by the seed and the seed's seed. As one generation passes away another
generation shall come. Instead of the fathers shall be the children.
Secondly, How long it shall be kept up - henceforth and for ever,
always, even unto the end of the world; for, the world being left to
stand for the sake of the church, we may be sure that as long as it does
stand Christ will have a church in it, though no always visible.
Thirdly, By what means it shall be kept up; by the constant residence of
the word and Spirit in it. 1. The Spirit that was upon Christ shall
always continue in the hearts of the faithful; there shall be some in
every age on whom he shall work, and in whom he shall dwell, and thus
the Comforter shall abide with the church for ever, [Joh
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016.md). 2. The word of Christ shall
always continue in the mouths of the faithful; there shall be some in
every age who, believing with the heart unto righteousness, shall with
the tongue make confession unto salvation. The word shall never depart
out of the mouth of the church; for there shall still be a seed to speak
Christ's holy language and profess his holy religion. Observe, The
Spirit and the word go together, and by them the church is kept up. For
the word in the mouths of our ministers, nay, the word in our own
mouths, will not profit us, unless the Spirit work with the word, and
give us an understanding. But the Spirit does his work by the word and
in concurrence with it; and whatever is pretended to be a dictate of the
Spirit must be tried by the scriptures. On these foundations the church
is built, stands firmly, and shall stand for ever, Christ himself being
the chief corner-stone.
