### [Psalms Chapter 53](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 53:0</span></span>

God speaks once, yea, twice, and it were well if man would even then
perceive it; God, in this psalm, speaks twice, for this is the same
almost verbatim with the fourteenth psalm. The scope of it is to
convince us of our sins, to set us a blushing and trembling because of
them; and this is what we are with so much difficulty brought to that
there is need of line upon line to this purport. The word, as a
convincing word, is compared to a hammer, the strokes whereof must be
frequently repeated. God, by the psalmist here, I. Shows us how bad we
are ([Psa 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001).md). II. Proves it upon us
by his own certain knowledge ([Psa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#002.md), [Psa
53:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#003).md). III. He speaks terror to
persecutors, the worst of sinners ([Psa
53:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#004.md), [Psa
53:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#005).md). IV. He speaks encouragement to
God's persecuted people ([Psa 53:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#006).md).
Some little variation there is between [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md) and this, but none
considerable, only between [Psa 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#005.md),
[Psa 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#006.md), there, and [Psa
53:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#005.md) here; some expressions there used
are here left out, concerning the shame which the wicked put upon God's
people, and instead of that, is here foretold the shame which God would
put upon the wicked, which alteration, with some others, he made by
divine direction when he delivered it the second time to the chief
musician. In singing it we ought to lament the corruption of the human
nature, and the wretched degeneracy of the world we live in, yet
rejoicing in hope of the great salvation.

To the chief musician upon Mahalath, Maschil. A psalm of David.

[Psalms 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 53:1</span></span>

This psalm was opened before, and therefore we shall here only observe,
in short, some things concerning sin, in order to the increasing of our
sorrow for it and hatred of it. 1. The fact of sin. Is that proved? Can
the charge be made out? Yes, God is a witness to it, an unexceptionable
witness: from the place of his holiness he looks on the children of men,
and sees how little good there is among them, [Psa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#002.md). All the sinfulness of their
hearts and lives in naked and open before him. 2. The fault of sin. Is
there any harm in it? Yes, it is iniquity ([Psa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001.md), [Psa
53:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#004).md); it is an unrighteous thing; it
is that which there is no good in ([Psa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001.md), [Psa
53:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#003).md); it is an evil thing; it is the
worst of evils; it is that which makes this world such an evil world as
it is; it is going back from God, [Psa
53:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#003.md). 3. The fountain of sin. How
comes it that men are so bad? Surely it is because there is no fear of
God before their eyes: they say in their hearts, "There is no God at all
to call us to an account, none that we need to stand in awe of." Men's
bad practices flow from their bad principles; if they profess to know
God, yet in works, because in thoughts, they deny him. 4. The folly of
sin. He is a fool (in the account of God, whose judgment we are sure is
right) that harbours such corrupt thoughts. Atheists, whether in opinion
or practice, are the greatest fools in the world. Those that do not seek
God do not understand; they are like brute-beasts that have no
understanding; for man is distinguished from the brutes, not so much by
the powers of reason as by a capacity for religion. The workers of
iniquity, whatever they pretend to, have no knowledge; those may truly
be said to know nothing that do not know God, [Psa
53:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#004.md). 5. The filthiness of sin.
Sinners are corrupt ([Psa 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001).md); their
nature is vitiated and spoiled, and the more noble the nature is the
more vile it is when it is depraved, as that of the angels. Corruptio
optimi est pessima - The best things, when corrupted, become the worst.
Their iniquity is abominable; it is odious to the holy God, and it
renders them so; whereas otherwise he hates nothing that he has made. It
makes men filthy, altogether filthy. Wilful sinners are offensive in the
nostrils of the God of heaven and of the holy angels. What decency
soever proud sinners pretend to, it is certain that wickedness is the
greatest defilement in the world. 6. The fruit of sin. See to what a
degree of barbarity it brings men at last; when men's hearts are
hardened through the deceitfulness of sin see their cruelty to their
brethren, that are bone of their bone - because they will not run with
them to the same excess of riot, they eat them up as they eat bread; as
if they had not only become beasts, but beasts of prey. And see their
contempt of God at the same time. They have not called upon him, but
scorn to be beholden to him. 7. The fear and shame that attend sin ([Psa
53:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#005).md): There were those in great fear
who had made God their enemy; their own guilty consciences frightened
them, and filled them with horror, though otherwise there was no
apparent cause of fear. The wicked flees when none pursues. See the
ground of this fear; it is because God has formerly scattered the bones
of those that encamped against his people, not only broken their power
and dispersed their forces, but slain them, and reduced their bodies to
dry bones, like those scattered at the grave's mouth, [Psa
141:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#007.md). Such will be the fate of those
that lay siege to the camp of the saints and the beloved city, [Rev
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#009.md). The apprehensions of this cannot
but put those into frights that eat up God's people. This enables the
virgin, the daughter of Zion, to put them to shame, and expose them,
because God has despised them, to laugh at them, because he that sits in
heaven laughs at them. We need not look upon those enemies with fear
whom God looks upon with contempt. If he despises them, we may. 8. The
faith of the saints, and their hope and power touching the cure of this
great evil, [Psa 53:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#006.md). There will come
a Saviour, a great salvation, a salvation from sin. Oh that it might be
hastened! for it will bring in glorious and joyful times. There were
those in the Old Testament times that looked and hoped, that prayed and
waited, for this redemption. (1.) God will, in due time, save his church
from the sinful malice of its enemies, which will bring joy to Jacob and
Israel, that have long been in a mournful melancholy state. Such
salvations were often wrought, and all typical of the everlasting
triumphs of the glorious church. (2.) He will save all believers from
their own iniquities, that they may not be led captive by them, which
will be everlasting matter of joy to them. From this work the Redeemer
had his name - Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins, [Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md).
