### [Isaiah Chapter 62](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 62:0</span></span>

The business of prophets was both to preach and pray. In this chapter,
I. The prophet determines to apply closely and constantly to this
business ([Isa 62:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001).md). II. God appoints
him and others of his prophets to continue to do so, for the
encouragement of his people during the delays of their deliverance ([Isa
62:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006.md), [Isa
62:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#007).md). III. The promises are here
repeated and ratified of the great things God would do for his church,
for the Jews after their return out of captivity and for the Christian
church when it shall be set up in the world. 1. The church shall be made
honourable in the eyes of the world ([Isa
62:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#002).md). 2. It shall appear to be very
dear to God, precious and honourable in his sight ([Isa
62:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#003).md). 3. It shall enjoy great
plenty ([Isa 62:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#008.md), [Isa
62:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#009).md). 4. It shall be released out of
captivity and grow up again into a considerable nation, particularly
owned and favoured by heaven ([Isa
62:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010).md).

[Isaiah 62:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 62:1</span></span>

The prophet here tells us,

I. What he will do for the church. A prophet, as he is a seer, so he is
a spokesman. This prophet resolves to perform that office faithfully,
[Isa 62:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001.md). He will not hold his peace;
he will not rest; he will mind his business, will take pains, and never
desire to take his ease; and herein he was a type of Christ, who was
indefatigable in executing the office of a prophet and made it his meat
and drink till he had finished his work. Observe here, 1. What the
prophet's resolution is: He will not hold his peace. He will continue
instant in preaching, will not only faithfully deliver, but frequently
repeat, the messages he has received from the Lord. If people receive
not the precepts and promises at first, he will inculcate them and give
them line upon line. And he will continue instant in prayer; he will
never hold his peace at the throne of grace till he has prevailed with
God for the mercies promised; he will give himself to prayer and to the
ministry of the word, as Christ's ministers must ([Act
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#004).md), who must labour frequently in
both and never be weary of this well-doing. The business of ministers is
to speak from God to his people and to God for his people; and in
neither of these must they be silent. 2. What is the principle of this
resolution - for Zion's sake, and for Jerusalem's, not for the sake of
any private interest of his own, but for the church's sake, because he
has an affection and concern for Zion, and it lies near his heart.
Whatever becomes of his own house and family, he desires to see the good
of Jerusalem and resolves to seek it all the days of his life, [Psa
122:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#008.md), [Psa
122:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#009.md); [Psa
118:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005.md). It is God's Zion and his
Jerusalem, and it is therefore dear to him, because it is so to God and
because God's glory is interested in its prosperity. 3. How long he
resolves to continue this importunity - till the promise of the church's
righteousness and salvation, given in the foregoing chapter, be
accomplished. Isaiah will not himself live to see the release of the
captives out of Babylon, much less the bringing in of the gospel, in
which grace reigns through righteousness unto life and salvation; yet he
will not hold his peace till these be accomplished, even the utmost of
them, because his prophecies will continue speaking of these things, and
there shall in every age be a remnant that shall continue to pray for
them, as successors to him, till the promises be performed, and so the
prayers answered that were grounded upon them. Then the church's
righteousness and salvation will go forth as brightness, and as a lamp
that burns, so plainly that it will carry its own evidence along with
it. It will bring honour and comfort to the church, which will hereupon
both look pleasant and appear illustrious; and it will bring instruction
and direction to the world, a light not only to the eyes but to the
feet, and to the paths of those who before sat in darkness and in the
shadow of death.

II\. What God will do for the church. The prophet can but pray and
preach, but God will confirm the word and answer the prayers. 1. The
church shall be greatly admired. When that righteousness which is her
salvation, her praise, and her glory, shall be brought forth, the
Gentiles shall see it. The tidings of it shall be carried to the
Gentiles, and a tender of it made to them; they may so see this
righteousness as to share in it if it be not their own fault. "Even
kings shall see and be in love with the glory of thy righteousness"
([Isa 62:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#002).md), shall overlook the glory
of their own courts and kingdoms, and look at, and look after, the
spiritual glory of the church as that which excels. 2. She shall be
truly admirable. Great names make men considerable in the world, and
great respect is paid them thereupon; now it is agreed that honor est in
honorante - honour derives its value from the dignity of him who confers
it. God is the fountain of honour and from him the church's honour
comes: "Thou shalt be called by a new name, a pleasant name, such as
thou wast never called by before, no, not in the day of thy greatest
prosperity, and the reverse of that which thou wast called by in the day
of thy affliction; thou shalt have a new character, be advanced to a new
dignity, and those about thee shall have new thoughts of thee." This
seems to be alluded to in that promise ([Rev
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017).md) of the white stone and in the
stone a new name, and that ([Rev 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012).md)
of the name of the city of my God and my new name. It is a name which
the mouth of the Lord shall name, who, we are sure, miscalls nothing,
and who will oblige others to call her by the name he has given her; for
his judgment is according to truth and all shall concur with it sooner
or later. Two names God shall give her: - (1.) He shall call her his
crown ([Isa 62:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#003).md): Thou shalt be a
crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, not on his head (as adding any
real honour or power to him, as crowns do to those that are crowned with
them), but in his hand. He is pleased to account them, and show them
forth, as a glory and beauty to him. When he took them to be his people
it was that they might be unto him for a name, and for a praise, and for
a glory ([Jer 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#011).md): "Thou shalt be a
crown of glory and a royal diadem, through the hand, the good hand, of
thy God upon thee; he shall make thee so, for he shall be to thee a
crown of glory, [Isa 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#005.md). Thou shalt
be so in his hand, that is, under his protection; he that shall put
glory upon thee shall create a defence upon all that glory, so that the
flowers of thy crown shall never wither nor shall its jewels be lost."
(2.) He shall call her his spouse, [Isa
62:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004.md), [Isa
62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005.md). This is a yet greater honour,
especially considering what a forlorn condition she had been in. \[1.\]
Her case had been very melancholy. She was called forsaken and her land
desolate during the captivity, like a woman reproachfully divorced or
left a disconsolate widow. Such as the state of religion in the world
before the preaching of the gospel - it was in a manner forsaken and
desolate, a thing that no man looked after nor had any real concern for.
\[2.\] It should now be very pleasant, for God would return in mercy to
her. Instead of those two names of reproach, she shall be called by two
honourable names. First, She shall be called Hephzi-bah, which
signifies, My delight is in her; it was the name of Hezekiah's queen,
Manasseh's mother ([Kg2 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#001).md), a
proper name for a wife, who ought to be her husband's delight, [Pro
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#019.md). And here it is the church's
Maker that is her husband: The Lord delights in thee. God by his grace
has wrought that in his church which makes her his delight, she being
refined, and reformed, and brought home to him; and then by his
providence he does that for her which makes it appear that she is his
delight and that he delights to do her good. Secondly, She shall be
called Beulah, which signifies married, whereas she had been desolate, a
condition opposed to that of the married wife, [Isa
54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md). "Thy land shall be married, that
is, it shall become fruitful again, and be replenished." Though she has
long been barren, she shall again be peopled, shall again be made to
keep house and to be a joyful mother of children, [Psa
113:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#009.md). She shall be married, for, 1.
Her sons shall heartily espouse the land of their nativity and its
interests, which they had for a long time neglected, as despairing ever
to have any comfortable enjoyment of it: Thy sons shall marry thee, that
is, they shall live with thee and take delight in thee. When they were
in Babylon, they seemed to have espoused that land, for they were
appointed to settle, and to seek the peace of it, [Jer
29:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#005.md). But now they shall again marry
their own land, as a young man marries a virgin that he takes great
delight in, is extremely fond of, and is likely to have many children
by. It bodes well to a land when its own natives and inhabitants are
pleased with it, prefer it before other lands, when its princes marry
their country and resolve to take their lot with it. 2. Her God (which
is much better) shall betroth her to himself in righteousness, [Hos
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#019.md), [Hos
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#020.md). He will take pleasure in his
church: As the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, is pleased with his
relation to her and her affection to him, so shall thy God rejoice over
thee: he shall rest in his love to thee ([Zep
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#017).md); he shall take pleasure in thee
([Psa 147:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#011).md), and shall delight to do
thee good with his whole heart and his whole soul, [Jer
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#041.md). This is very applicable to the
love Christ has for his church and the complacency he takes in it, which
appears so brightly in Solomon's Song, and which will be complete in
heaven.

[Isaiah 62:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 62:6</span></span>

Two things are here promised to Jerusalem: -

I. Plenty of the means of grace - abundance of good preaching and good
praying ([Isa 62:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006.md), [Isa
62:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#007).md), and this shows the method God
takes when he designs mercy for a people; he first brings them to their
duty and pours out a spirit of prayer upon them, and then brings
salvation to them. Provision is made,

1\. That ministers may do their duty as watchmen. It is here spoken of
as a token for good, as a step towards further mercy and an earnest of
it, that, in order to what he designed for them, he would set watchmen
on their walls who should never hold their peace. Note, (1.) Ministers
are watchmen on the church's walls, for it is as a city besieged, whose
concern it is to have sentinels on the walls, to take notice and give
notice of the motions of the enemy. It is necessary that, as watchmen,
they be wakeful, and faithful, and willing to endure hardness. (2.) They
are concerned to stand upon their guard day and night; they must never
be off their watch as long as those for whose souls they watch are not
out of danger. (3.) They must never hold their peace; they must take all
opportunities to give warning to sinners, in season, out of season, and
must never betray the cause of Christ by a treacherous or cowardly
silence. They must never hold their peace at the throne of grace; they
must pray, and not faint, as Moses lifted up his hands and kept them
steady, till Israel had obtained the victory over Amalek, [Exo
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#010.md), [Exo
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#012.md).

2\. That people may do their duty. As those that make mention of the
Lord, let not them keep silence neither, let not them think it enough
that their watchmen pray for them, but let them pray for themselves; all
will be little enough to meet the approaching mercy with due solemnity.
Note, (1.) It is the character of God's professing people that they make
mention of the Lord, and continue to do so even in bad times, when the
land is termed forsaken and desolate. They are the Lord's remembrancers
(so the margin reads it); they remember the Lord themselves and put one
another in mind of him. (2.) God's professing people must be a praying
people, must be public-spirited in prayer, must wrestle with God in
prayer, and continue to do so: "Keep not silence; never grow remiss in
the duty nor weary of it." Give him no rest - alluding to an importunate
beggar, to the widow that with her continual coming wearied the judge
into a compliance. God said to Moses, Let me alone ([Exo
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#010).md), and Jacob to Christ, I will
not let thee go except thou bless me, [Gen
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#026). (3..md) God is so far from being
displeased with our pressing importunity, as men commonly are, that he
invites and encourages it; he bids us to cry after him; he is not like
those disciples who discouraged a petitioner, [Mat
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#023.md). He bids us make pressing
applications at the throne of grace, and give him no rest, [Luk
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#005.md), [Luk
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#008.md). He suffers himself not only to
be reasoned with, but to be wrestled with. (4.) The public welfare or
prosperity of God's Jerusalem is that which we should be most
importunate for at the throne of grace; we should pray for the good of
the church. \[1.\] That it may be safe, that he would establish it, that
the interests of the church may be firm, may be settled for the present
and secured to posterity. \[2.\] That it may be great, may be a praise
in the earth, that it may be praised, and God may be praised for it.
When gospel truths are cleared and vindicated, when gospel ordinances
are duly administered in their purity and power, when the church becomes
eminent for holiness and love, then Jerusalem is a praise in the earth,
then it is in reputation. (5.) We must persevere in our prayers for
mercy to the church till the mercy come; we must do as the prophet's
servant did, go yet seven times, till the promising cloud appear, [Kg1
18:44](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#044). (6..md) It is a good sign that God
is coming towards a people in ways of mercy when he pours out a spirit
of prayer upon them and stirs them up to be fervent and constant in
their intercessions.

II\. Plenty of all other good things, [Isa
62:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#008.md). This follows upon the former;
when the people praise God, when all the people praise him, then shall
the earth yield her increase ([Psa
67:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#005.md), [Psa
67:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#006).md), and outward prosperity,
crowning its piety, shall help to make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
Observe,

1\. The great distress they had been in, and the losses they had
sustained. Their corn had been meat for their enemies, which they hoped
would be meat for themselves and their families. Here was a double
grievance, that they themselves wanted that which was necessary to the
support of life and were in danger of perishing for want of it, and that
their enemies were strengthened by it, had their camp victualled with
it, and so were the better able to do them a mischief. God is said to
give their corn to their enemies, because he not only permitted it, but
ordered it, to be the just punishment both of their abuse of plenty and
of their symbolizing with strangers, [Isa
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#007.md). The wine which they had laboured
for, and which in their affliction they needed for the relief of those
among them that were of a heavy heart, strangers drank it, to gratify
their lusts with; this sore judgment was threatened for their sins, [Lev
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016.md); [Deu
28:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#033.md). See how uncertain our
creature-comforts are, and how much it is our wisdom to labour for that
meat which we can never be robbed of.

2\. The great fulness and satisfaction they should now be restored to
([Isa 62:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#009).md): Those that have gathered
it shall eat it, and praise the Lord. See here, (1.) God's mercy in
giving plenty, and peace to enjoy it, - that the earth yields her
increase, that there are hands to be employed in gathering it in, and
that they are not taken off by plague and sickness, or otherwise
employed in war, - that strangers and enemies do not come and gather it
for themselves, or take it from us when we have gathered it, - that we
eat the labour of our hands and the bread is not eaten out of our
mouths, - and especially that we have opportunity and a heart to honour
God with it, and that his courts are open to us and we are not
restrained from attending on him in them. (2.) Our duty in the enjoyment
of this mercy. We must gather what God gives, with care and industry; we
must eat it freely and cheerfully, not bury the gifts of God's bounty,
but make use of them. We must, when we have eaten and are full, bless
the Lord, and give him thanks for his bounty to us; and we must serve
him with our abundance, use it in works of piety and charity, eat it and
drink it in the courts of his holiness, where the altar, the priest, and
the poor must all have their share. The greatest comfort that a good man
has in his meat and drink is that it furnishes him with a meat-offering
and a drink-offering for the Lord his God ([Joe
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#014).md); the greatest comfort that he
has in an estate is that it gives him an opportunity of honouring God
and doing good. This wine is to be drunk in the courts of God's
holiness, and therefore moderately and with sobriety, as before the
Lord.

3\. The solemn ratification of this promise: The Lord has sworn by his
right hand, and by the arm of his strength, that he will do this for his
people. God confirms it by an oath, that his people, who trust in him
and his word, may have strong consolation, [Heb
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#017.md), [Heb
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018.md). And, since he can swear by no
greater, he swears by himself, sometimes by his being (As I live, [Eze
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#011).md), sometimes by his holiness
([Psa 89:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#035).md), here by his power, his
right hand (which was lifted up in swearing, [Deu
32:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#040).md), and his arm of power; for it
is a great satisfaction to those who build their hopes on God's promise
to be sure that what he has promised he is able to perform, [Rom
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#021.md). To assure us of this he has
sworn by his strength, pawning the reputation of his omnipotence upon
it; if he do not do it, let it be said, It was because he could not,
which the Egyptians shall never say ([Num
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#016).md) nor any other. It is the
comfort of God's people that his power is engaged for them, his right
hand, where the Mediator sits.

[Isaiah 62:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 62:10</span></span>

This, as many like passages before, refers to the deliverance of the
Jews out of Babylon, and, under the type and figure of that, to the
great redemption wrought out by Jesus Christ, and the proclaiming of
gospel grace and liberty through him. 1. Way shall be made for this
salvation; all difficulties shall be removed, and whatever might
obstruct it shall be taken out of the way, [Isa
62:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010.md). The gates of Babylon shall be
thrown open, that they may with freedom go through them; the way from
Babylon to the land of Israel shall be prepared; causeways shall be made
and cast up through wet and miry places, and the stones gathered out
from places rough and rocky; in the convenient places appointed for
their rendezvous standards shall be set up for their direction and
encouragement, that they may embody for their greater safety. Thus John
Baptist was sent to prepare the way of the Lord, [Mat
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003.md). And, before Christ by his graces
and comforts comes to any for salvation, preparation is made for him by
repentance, which is called the preparation of the gospel of peace, [Eph
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#015.md). Here the way is levelled by it,
there the feet are shod with it, which comes all to one, for both are in
order to a journey. 2. Notice shall be given of this salvation, [Isa
62:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#011.md), [Isa
62:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#012.md). It shall be proclaimed to the
captives that they are set at liberty and may go if they please; it
shall be proclaimed to their neighbours, to all about them, to the end
of the world, that God has pleaded Zion's just, injured, and despised
cause. Let is be said to Zion, for her comfort, Behold, thy salvation
comes (that is, thy Saviour, who brings salvation); he will bring such a
work, such a reward, in this salvation, as shall be admired by all, a
reward of comfort and peace with him; but a work of humiliation and
reformation before him, to prepare his people for that recompence of
their sufferings; and then, with reference to each, it follows, they
shall be called, The holy people, and the redeemed of the Lord. The work
before him, which shall be wrought in them and upon them, shall
denominate them a holy people, cured of their inclination to idolatry
and consecrated to God only; and the reward with him, the deliverance
wrought for them, shall denominate them the redeemed of the Lord, so
redeemed as none but God could redeem them, and redeemed to be his,
their bonds loosed, that they might be his servants. Jerusalem shall
then be called, Sought out, a city not forsaken. She had been forsaken
for many years; there were neither traders nor worshippers that enquired
the way to Jerusalem as formerly, when it was frequented by both. But
now God will again make her considerable. She shall be sought out,
visited, resorted to, and court made to her, as much as ever. When
Jerusalem is called a holy city, then it is called sought out; for
holiness puts an honour and beauty upon any place or person, which draws
respect, and makes them to be admired, beloved, and enquired after. But
this being proclaimed to the end of the world must have a reference to
the gospel of Christ, which was to be preached to every creature; and it
intimates, (1.) The glory of Christ. It is published immediately to the
church, but is thence echoed to every nation: Behold, thy salvation
cometh. Christ is not only the Saviour, but the salvation itself; for
the happiness of believers is not only from him, but in him, [Isa
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#002.md). His salvation consists both in
the work and in the reward which he brings with him; for those that are
his shall neither be idle nor lose their labour. (2.) The beauty of the
church. Christians shall be called saints ([Co1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#002).md), the holy people, for they are
chosen and called to salvation through sanctification. They shall be
called the redeemed of the Lord; to him they owe their liberty, and
therefore to him they owe their service, and they shall not be ashamed
to own both. None are to be called the redeemed of the Lord but those
that are the holy people; the people of God's purchase are a holy
nation. And they shall be called, Sought out. God shall seek them out,
and find them, wherever they are dispersed, eclipsed, or lost in a
crowd; men shall seek them out, that they may join themselves to them,
and not forsake them. It is good to associate with the holy people, that
we may learn their ways, and with the redeemed of the Lord, that we may
share in the blessings of the redemption.
