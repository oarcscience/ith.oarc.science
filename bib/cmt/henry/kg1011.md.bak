### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg1 11:0</span></span>

This chapter begins with as melancholy a "but" as almost any we find in
all the Bible. Hitherto we have read nothing of Solomon but what was
great and good; but the lustre both of his goodness and of his greatness
is here sullied and eclipsed, and his sun sets under a cloud. I. The
glory of his piety is stained by his departure from God and his duty, in
his latter days, marrying strange wives and worshipping strange gods
([Kg1 11:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#004).md). II. The glory of his
prosperity is stained by God's displeasure against him and the fruits of
that displeasure. 1. He sent him an angry message ([Kg1
11:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#009).md). 2. He stirred up enemies,
who gave him disturbance, Hadad ([Kg1
11:14-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014).md), Rezon ([Kg1
11:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#023).md). 3. He gave away ten tribes
of his twelve, from his posterity after him, to Jeroboam, whom therefore
he sought in vain to slay ([Kg1
11:26-40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#026).md), and this is all that
remains here to be told concerning Solomon, except his death and burial
([Kg1 11:41-43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#041).md), for there is nothing
perfect under the sun, but all is so above the sun.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 11:1</span></span>

This is a sad story, and very surprising, of Solomon's defection and
degeneracy.

I. Let us enquire into the occasions and particulars of it. Shall
Solomon fall, that was the beauty of Israel, and so great a blessing of
his generation? Yes, it is too true, and the scripture is faithful in
relating it, and repeating it, and referring to it long after, [Neh
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#026.md). There was no king like Solomon
who was beloved of his God, yet even him did outlandish women cause to
sin. There is the summary of his apostasy; it was the woman that
deceived him, and was first in the transgression.

1\. He doted on strange women, many strange women. Here his revolt
began. (1.) He gave himself to women, which his mother had particularly
cautioned him against. [Pro 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#003.md), Give
not thy strength unto women (perhaps alluding to Samson, who lost his
strength by giving information of it to a woman), for it is that which,
as much as any thing, destroys kings. His father David's fall began with
the lusts of the flesh, which he should have taken warning by. The love
of women has cast down many wounded ([Pro
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#026)) and many (says bishop Hall.md) have
had their head broken by their own rib. (2.) He took many women, so many
that, at last, they amounted to 700 wives and 300 concubines, 1000 in
all, and not one good one among them, as he himself owns in his
penitential sermon ([Ecc 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#028).md), for no
woman of established virtue would be one of such a set. God had, by his
law, particularly forbidden the kings to multiply either horses or
wives, [Deu 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#016.md), [Deu
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#017.md). How he broke the former law, in
multiplying horses, and having them out of Egypt too (which was
expressly prohibited in that law) we read [Kg1
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029.md), and here we are told how he
broke the latter (which proved of more fatal consequence) in multiplying
wives. Note, Less sins, made gold with, open the door to greater. David
had multiplied wives too much, and perhaps that made Solomon presume it
lawful. Note, If those that are in reputation for religion in any thing
set a bad example, they know not what a deal of mischief they may do by
it, particularly to their own children. One bad act of a good man may be
of more pernicious consequence to others than twenty of a wicked man.
Probably Solomon, when he began to multiply wives, intended not to
exceed his father's number. But the way of sin is down-hill; those that
have got into it cannot easily stop themselves. Divine wisdom has
appointed one woman for one man, did so at first; and those who do not
think one enough will not think two or three enough. Unbridled lust will
be unbounded, and the loosened hind will wander endlessly. But this was
not all: (3.) They were strange women, Moabites, Ammonites, etc., of the
nations which God had particularly forbidden them to intermarry with,
[Kg1 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#002.md). Some think it was in policy
that he married these foreigners, by them to get intelligence of the
state of those countries. I rather fear it was because the daughters of
Israel were too grave and modest for him, and those foreigners pleased
him with the looseness and wantonness of their dress, and air, and
conversation. Or, perhaps, it was looked upon as a piece of state to
have his seraglio, as his other treasures, replenished with that which
was far-fetched; as if that were too great an honour for the best of his
subjects which would really have been a disgrace to the meanest of them
- to be his mistresses. And, (4.) To complete the mischief, Solomon
clave unto these in love, [Kg1 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#002.md).
He not only kept them, but was extravagantly fond of them, set his heart
upon them, spent his time among them, thought every thing well they said
and did, and despised Pharaoh's daughter, his rightful wife, who had
been dear to him, and all the ladies of Israel, in comparison of them.
Solomon was master of a great deal of knowledge, but to what purpose,
when he had no better a government of his appetites?

2\. He was drawn by them to the worship of strange gods, as Israel to
Baal-peor by the daughters of Moab. This was the bad consequence of his
multiplying wives. We have reason to think it impaired his health, and
hastened upon him the decays of age; it exhausted his treasure, which,
though vast indeed, would be found little enough to maintain the pride
and vanity of all these women; perhaps it occasioned him, in his latter
end, to neglect his business, by which he lost his supplies from abroad,
and was forced, for the keeping up of his grandeur, to burden his
subjects with those taxes which they complained of, [Kg1
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#004.md). But none of these consequences
were so bad as this: His wives turned away his heart after other gods,
[Kg1 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#003.md), [Kg1
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#004). (1..md) He grew cool and
indifferent in his own religion and remiss in the service of the God of
Israel: His heart was not perfect with the Lord his God ([Kg1
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#004).md), nor did he follow him fully
([Kg1 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#006).md), like David. We cannot
suppose that he quite cast off the worship of God, much less that he
restrained or hindered it (the temple-service went on as usual); but he
grew less frequent, and less serious, in his ascent to the house of the
Lord and his attendance on his altar. He left his first love, lost his
zeal for God, and did not persevere to the end as he had begun;
therefore it is said he was not perfect, because he was not constant;
and he followed not God fully, because he turned from following him, and
did not continue to the end. His father David had many faults, but he
never neglected the worship of God, nor grew remiss in that, as Solomon
did (his wives using all their arts to divert him from it), and there
began his apostasy. (2.) He tolerated and maintained his wives in their
idolatry and made no scruple of joining with them in it. Pharaoh's
daughter was proselyted (as is supposed) to the Jews' religion, but,
when he began to grow careless in the worship of God himself, he used no
means to convert his other wives to it; in complaisance to them, he
built chapels for their gods ([Kg1
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#007.md), [Kg1
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#008).md), maintained their priests, and
occasionally did himself attend their altars, making a jest of it,
asking, "What harm is there in it? Are not all religions alike?" which
(says bishop Patrick) has been the disease of some great wits. When he
humoured one thus, the rest would take it ill if he did not, in like
manner, gratify them, so that he did it for all his wives ([Kg1
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#008).md), and at last came to such a
degree of impiety that he set up a high place for Chemosh in the hill
that is before Jerusalem, the mount of Olives, as if to confront the
temple which he himself had built. These high places continued here, not
utterly demolished, till Josiah's time, [Kg2
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#013.md). This is the account here given
of Solomon's apostasy.

II\. Let us now pause awhile, and lament Solomon's fall; and we may
justly stand and wonder at it. How has the gold become dim! How has the
most fine gold changed! Be astonished, O heavens! at this, and be
horribly afraid, as the prophet exclaims in a like case, [Jer
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#012.md).

1\. How strange, (1.) That Solomon, in his old age, should be ensnared
with fleshly lusts, youthful lusts. As we must never presume upon the
strength of our resolutions, so neither upon the weakness of our
corruptions, so as to be secure and off our guard. (2.) That so wise a
man as Solomon was, so famed for a quick understanding and sound
judgment, should suffer himself to be made such a fool of by these
foolish women. (3.) That one who had so often and so plainly warned
others of the danger of the love of women should himself be so
wretchedly bewitched with it; it is easier to see a mischief, and to
show it to others, than to shun it ourselves. (4.) That so good a man,
so zealous for the worship of God, who had been so conversant with
divine things, and who prayed that excellent prayer at the dedication of
the temple, should do these sinful things. Is this Solomon? Have all his
wisdom and devotion come to this at last? Never was gallant ship so
wrecked; never was crown so profaned.

2\. What shall we say to all this? Why God permitted it it is not for us
to enquire; his way is in the sea and his path in the great waters; he
knew how to bring glory to himself out of it. God foresaw it when he
said concerning him that should build the temple, If he commit iniquity,
etc., [Sa2 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014.md). But it concerns us to
enquire what good use we may make of it. (1.) Let him that thinks he
stands take heed lest he fall. We see how weak we are of ourselves,
without the grace of God; let us therefore live in a constant dependence
on that grace. (2.) See the danger of a prosperous condition, and how
hard it is to overcome the temptations of it. Solomon, like Jeshurun,
waxed fat and then kicked. The food convenient, which Agur prayed for,
is safer and better than the food abundant, which Solomon was even
surfeited with. (3.) See what need those have to stand upon their guard
who have made a great profession of religion, and shown themselves
forward and zealous in devotion, because the devil will set upon them
most violently, and, if they misbehave, the reproach is the greater. It
is the evening that commends the day; let us therefore fear, lest,
having run well, we seem to come short.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 11:9</span></span>

Here is, I. God's anger against Solomon for his sin. The thing he did
displeased the Lord. Time was then the Lord loved Solomon ([Sa2
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#024).md) and delighted in him ([Kg1
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#009).md), but now the Lord was angry with
Solomon ([Kg1 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#009).md), for there was in
his sin, 1. The most base ingratitude that could be. He turned from the
Lord who had appeared unto him twice, once before he began to build the
temple ([Kg1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005).md) and once after he
had dedicated it, [Kg1 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#002.md). God keeps
account of the gracious visits he makes us, whether we do or no, knows
how often he has appeared to us and for us, and will remember it against
us if we turn from him. God's appearing to Solomon was such a sensible
confirmation of his faith as should have for ever prevented his
worshipping any other god; it was also such a distinguishing favour, and
put such an honour upon him, as he ought never to have forgotten,
especially considering what God said to him in both these appearances.
2. The most wilful disobedience. This was the very thing concerning
which God had commanded him - that he should not go after other gods,
yet he was not restrained by such an express admonition, [Kg1
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#010.md). Those who have dominion over
men are apt to forget God's dominion over them; and, while they demand
obedience from their inferiors, to deny it to him who is the Supreme.

II\. The message he sent him hereupon ([Kg1
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#011).md): The Lord said unto Solomon (it
is likely by a prophet) that he must expect to smart for his apostasy.
And here, 1. The sentence is just, that, since he had revolted from God,
part of his kingdom should revolt from his family; he had given God's
glory to the creature, and therefore God would give his crown to his
servant: "I will rend the kingdom from thee, in thy posterity, and will
give it to thy servant, who shall bear rule over much of that for which
thou hast laboured." This was a great mortification to Solomon, who
pleased himself no doubt with the prospect of the entail of his rich
kingdom upon his heirs for ever. Sin brings ruin upon families, cuts off
entails, alienates estates, and lays men's honour in the dust. 2. Yet
the mitigations of it are very kind, for David's sake ([Kg1
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#012.md), [Kg1
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#013).md), that is, for the sake of the
promise made to David. Thus all the favour God shows to man is for
Christ's sake, and for the sake of the covenant made with him. The
kingdom shall be rent from Solomon's house, but, (1.) Not immediately.
Solomon shall not live to see it done, but it shall be rent out of the
hand of his son, a son that was born to him by one of his strange wives,
for his mother was an Ammonitess ([Kg1
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#031).md) and probably had been a
promoter of idolatry. What comfort can a man take in leaving children
and an estate behind him if he do not leave a blessing behind him? Yet,
if judgments be coming, it is a favour to us if they come not in our
days, as [Kg2 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#019). (2..md) Not wholly.
One tribe, that of Judah, the strongest and most numerous, shall remain
to the house of David ([Kg1 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#013).md),
for Jerusalem's sake, which David built, and for the sake of the temple
there, which Solomon built; these shall not go into other hands. Solomon
did not quickly nor wholly turn away from God; therefore God did not
quickly nor wholly take the kingdom from him.

Upon this message which God graciously sent to Solomon, to awaken his
conscience and bring him to repentance, we have reason to hope that he
humbled himself before God, confessed his sin, begged pardon, and
returned to his duty, that he then published his repentance in the book
of Ecclesiastes, where he bitterly laments his own folly and madness
([Ecc 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#025.md), [Ecc
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026).md), and warns others to take heed
of the like evil courses, and to fear God and keep his commandments, in
consideration of the judgment to come, which, it is likely, had made him
tremble, as it did Felix. That penitential sermon was as true an
indication of a heart broken for sin and turned from it as David's
penitential psalms were, though of another nature. God's grace in his
people works variously. Thus, though Solomon fell, he was not utterly
cast down; what God had said to David concerning him was fulfilled: I
will chasten him with the rod of men, but my mercy shall not depart from
him, [Sa2 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014.md), [Sa2
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#015.md). Though God may suffer those whom
he loves to fall into sin, he will not suffer them to lie still in it.
Solomon's defection, though it was much his reproach and a great blemish
to his personal character, yet did not so far break in upon the
character of his reign but that it was afterwards made the pattern of a
good reign, [Ch2 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#017.md), where the
kings are said to have done well, while they walked in the way of David
and Solomon. But, though we have all this reason to hope he repented and
found mercy, yet the Holy Ghost did not think fit expressly to record
his recovery, but left it doubtful, for warning to others not to sin
upon presumption of repenting, for it is but a peradventure whether God
will give them repentance, or, if he do, whether he will give the
evidence of it to themselves or others. Great sinners may recover
themselves and have the benefit of their repentance, and yet be denied
both the comfort and credit of it; the guilt may be taken away, and yet
not the reproach.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 11:14</span></span>

While Solomon kept closely to God and to his duty there was no adversary
nor evil occurrent ([Kg1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#004).md), nothing
to create him any disturbance or uneasiness in the least; but here we
have an account of two adversaries that appeared against him,
inconsiderable, and that could not have done any thing worth taking
notice of if Solomon had not first made God his enemy. What hurt could
Hadad or Rezon have done to so great and powerful a king as Solomon was
if he had not, by sin, made himself mean and weak? And then those little
people menace and insult him. If God be on our side, we need not fear
the greatest adversary; but, if he be against us, he can made us fear
the least, and the very grasshopper shall be a burden. Observe,

I. Both these adversaries God stirred up, [Kg1
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014.md), [Kg1
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#023.md). Though they themselves were
moved by principles of ambition or revenge, God made use of them to
serve his design of correcting Solomon. The principal judgment
threatened was deferred, namely, the rending of the kingdom from him,
but he himself was made to fee the smart of the rod, for his greater
humiliation. Note, Whoever are, in any way, adversaries to us, we must
take notice of the hand of God stirring them up to be so, as he bade
Shimei curse David; we must look through the instruments of our trouble
to the author of it and hear the Lord's controversy in it.

II\. Both these adversaries had the origin of their enmity to Solomon
and Israel laid in David's time, and in his conquests of their
respective countries, [Kg1 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#015.md), [Kg1
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#024.md). Solomon had the benefit and
advantage of his father's successes both in the enlargement of his
dominion and the increase of his treasure, and would never have known
any thing but the benefit of them if he had kept closely to God; but now
he finds evils to balance the advantages, and that David had made
himself enemies, who were thorns in his sides. Those that are too free
in giving provocation ought to consider that perhaps it may be
remembered in time to come and returned with interest to theirs after
them; having so few friends in this world, it is our wisdom not to make
ourselves more enemies than we needs must.

1\. Hadad, an Edomite, was an adversary to Solomon. We are not told what
he did against him, nor which way he gave him disturbance, only, in
general, that he was an adversary to him: but we are told, (1.) What
induced him to bear Solomon a grudge. David had conquered Edom, [Sa2
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#014.md). Joab put all the males to the
sword, [Kg1 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#015.md), [Kg1
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#016.md). A terrible execution he made,
avenging on Edom their old enmity to Israel, yet perhaps with too great
a severity. From this general slaughter, while Joab was burying the
slain (for he left not any alive of their own people to bury them, and
buried they must be, or they would be an annoyance to the country, [Eze
39:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#012).md), Hadad, a branch of the royal
family, then a little child, was taken and preserved by some of the
king's servants, and conveyed to Egypt, [Kg1
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#017.md). They halted by the way, in
Midian first, and then in Paran, where they furnished themselves with
men, not to fight for them or force their passage, but to attend them,
that their young master might go into Egypt with an equipage agreeable
to his quality. There he was kindly sheltered and entertained by
Pharaoh, as a distressed prince, as well provided for, and so
recommended himself that, in process of time, he married the queen's
sister ([Kg1 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#019).md), and by her had a
child, which the queen herself conceived such a kindness for that she
brought him up in Pharaoh's house, among the king's children. (2.) What
enabled him to do Solomon a mischief. Upon the death of David and Joab,
he returned to his own country, in which, it should seem, he settled and
remained quiet while Solomon continued wise and watchful for the public
good, but from which he had opportunity of making inroads upon Israel
when Solomon, having sinned away his wisdom as Samson did his strength
(and in the same way), grew careless of public affairs, was off his
guard himself, and had forfeited the divine protection. What vexation
Hadad gave to Solomon we are not here told, but only how loth Pharaoh
was to part with him and how earnestly he solicited his stay ([Kg1
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#022).md): What hast thou lacked with me?
"Nothing," says Hadad; "but let me go to my own country, my native air,
my native soil." Peter Martyr has a pious reflection upon this: "Heaven
is our home, and we ought to keep up a holy affection to that, and
desire towards it, even when the world, the place of our banishment,
smiles most upon us." Does it ask, What have you lacked, that you are so
willing to be gone? We may answer, "Nothing that the world can do for
us; but still let us go thither, where our hope, and honour, and
treasure are."

2\. Rezon, a Syrian, was another adversary to Solomon. When David
conquered the Syrians, he headed the remains, lived at large by spoil
and rapine, till Solomon grew careless, and then he got possession of
Damascus, reigned there ([Kg1 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#024).md)
and over the country about ([Kg1
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#025).md), and he created troubles to
Israel, probably in conjunction with Hadad, all the days of Solomon
(namely, after his apostasy), or he was an enemy to Israel during all
Solomon's reign, and upon all occasions vented his then impotent malice
against them, but till Solomon's revolt, when his defence had departed
from him, he could not do them any mischief. It is said of him that he
abhorred Israel. Other princes loved and admired Israel and Solomon, and
courted their friendship, but here was one that abhorred them. The
greatest and best of princes and people, however much they may in
general be respected, will yet perhaps be hated and abhorred by some.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 11:26</span></span>

We have here the first mention of that infamous name Jeroboam the son of
Nebat, that made Israel to sin; he is here brought upon the stage as an
adversary to Solomon, whom God had expressly told ([Kg1
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#011).md) that he would give the greatest
part of his kingdom to his servant, and Jeroboam was the man. We have
here an account,

I. Of his extraction, [Kg1 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#026.md). He
was of the tribe of Ephraim, he next in honour to Judah. His mother was
a widow, to whom Providence had made up the loss of a husband in a son
that was active and ingenious, and (we may suppose) a great support and
comfort to her.

II\. Of his elevation. It was Solomon's wisdom, when he had work to do,
to employ proper persons in it. He observed Jeroboam to be a very
industrious young man, one that minded his business, took a pleasure in
it, and did it with all his might, and therefore he gradually advanced
him, till at length he made him receiver-general for the two tribes of
Ephraim and Manasseh, or perhaps put him into an office equivalent to
that of lord-lieutenant of those two counties, for he was ruler of the
burden, or tribute, that is, either of the taxes or of the militia of
the house of Joseph. Note, Industry is the way to preferment. Seest thou
a man diligent in his business, that will take care and pains, and go
through with it? he shall stand before kings, and not always be on the
level with mean men. Observe a difference between David, and both his
predecessor and his successor: when Saul saw a valiant man he took him
to himself ([Sa1 14:52](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#052).md); when Solomon
saw an industrious man he preferred him; but David's eyes were upon the
faithful in the land, that they might dwell with him: if he saw a godly
man, he preferred him, for he was a man after God's own heart, whose
countenance beholds the upright.

III\. Of his designation to the government of the ten tribes after the
death of Solomon. Some think he was himself plotting against Solomon,
and contriving to rise to the throne, that he was turbulent and
aspiring. The Jews say that when he was employed by Solomon in building
Millo he took opportunities of reflecting upon Solomon as oppressive to
his people, and suggesting that which would alienate them from his
government. It is not indeed probable that he should say much to that
purport, for Solomon would have got notice of it, and it would have
hindered his preferment; but it is plainly intimated that he had it in
his thoughts, for the prophet tells him ([Kg1
11:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#037).md), Thou shalt reign according to
all that thy soul desireth. But this was the cause, or rather this was
the story, of the lifting up of his hand against the king: Solomon made
him ruler over the tribes of Joseph, and, as he was going to take
possession of his government, he was told by a prophet in God's name
that he should be king, which emboldened him to aim high, and in some
instances to oppose the king and give him vexation. 1. The prophet by
whom this message was sent was Ahijah of Shiloh; we shall read of him
again, [Kg1 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#002.md). It seems, Shiloh was
not so perfectly forsaken and forgotten of God but that, in remembrance
of the former days, it was blessed with a prophet. He delivered his
message to Jeroboam in the way, his servants being probably ordered to
retire, as in a like case ([Sa1 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#027).md),
when Samuel delivered his message to Saul. God's word was not the less
sacred and sure for being delivered to him thus obscurely, under a hedge
it may be. 2. The sign by which it was represented to him was the
rending of a garment into twelve pieces, and giving him ten, [Kg1
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#030.md), [Kg1
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#031.md). It is not certain whether the
garment was Jeroboam's, as is commonly taken for granted, or Ahijah's,
which is more probable: He (that is, the prophet) had clad himself with
a new garment, on purpose that he might with it give him a sign. The
rending of the kingdom from Saul was signified by the rending of
Samuel's mantle, not Saul's, [Sa1
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#027.md), [Sa1
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#028.md). And it was more significant to
give Jeroboam ten pieces of that which was not his own before than of
that which was. The prophets, both true and false, used such signs, even
in the New Testament, as Agabus, [Act
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#010.md), [Act
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#011.md). 3. The message itself, which is
very particular, (1.) He assures him that he shall be king over ten of
the twelve tribes of Israel, [Kg1
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#031.md). The meanness of his extraction
and employment shall be no hindrance to his advancement, when the God of
Israel says (by whom kings reign), I will give ten tribes unto thee.
(2.) He tells him the reason; not for his good character or deserts, but
for the chastising of Solomon's apostasy: "Because he, and his family,
and many of his people with him, have forsaken me, and worshipped other
gods," [Kg1 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#033.md). It was because they
had done ill, not because he was likely to do much better. Thus Israel
must know that it is not for their righteousness that they are made
masters of Canaan, but for the wickedness of the Canaanites, [Deu
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#004.md). Jeroboam did not deserve so good
a post, but Israel deserved so bad a prince. In telling him that the
reason why he rent the kingdom from the house of Solomon was because
they had forsaken God, he warns him to take heed of sinning away his
preferment in like manner. (3.) He limits his expectations to the ten
tribes only, and to them in reversion after the death of Solomon, lest
he should aim at the whole and give immediate disturbance to Solomon's
government. He is here told, \[1.\] That two tribes (called here one
tribe, because little Benjamin was in a manner lost in the thousands of
Judah) should remain sure to the house of David, and he must never make
any attempt upon them: He shall have one tribe ([Kg1
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#032).md), and again ([Kg1
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#036).md), That David may have a lamp,
that is, a shining name and memory ([Psa
132:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#017).md), and his family, as a royal
family, may not be extinct. He must not think that David was rejected,
as Saul was. No, God would not take his loving-kindness from him, as he
did from Saul. The house of David must be supported and kept in
reputation, for all this, because out of it the Messiah must arise.
Destroy it not, for that blessing is in it. \[2.\] That Solomon must
keep possession during his life, [Kg1
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#034.md), [Kg1
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#035.md). Jeroboam therefore must not
offer to dethrone him, but wait with patience till his day shall come to
fall. Solomon shall be prince, all the days of his life, not for his own
sake (he had forfeited his crown to the justice of God), but for David
my servant's sake, because he kept my commandments. Children that do not
tread in their parents' steps yet often fare the better in this world
for their good parents' piety. (4.) He gives him to understand that he
will be upon his good behaviour. The grant of the crown must run quamdiu
se bene gesserit - during good behaviour. "If thou wilt do what is right
in my sight, I will build thee a sure house, and not otherwise" ([Kg1
11:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#038).md), intimating that, if he forsook
God, even his advancement to the throne would in time lay his family in
the dust; whereas the seed of David, though afflicted, should not be
afflicted for ever ([Kg1 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#039).md), but
should flourish again, as it did in many of the illustrious kings of
Judah, who reigned in glory when Jeroboam's family was extirpated.

IV\. Jeroboam's flight into Egypt, [Kg1
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#040.md). In some way or other Solomon
came to know of all this, probably from Jeroboam's own talk of it; he
could not conceal it as Saul did, nor keep his own counsel; if he had,
he might have staid in his country, and been preparing there for his
future advancement; but letting it be known, 1. Solomon foolishly sought
to kill his successor. Had not he taught others that, whatever devices
are in men's hearts, the counsel of the Lord shall stand? And yet does
he himself think to defeat that counsel? 2. Jeroboam prudently withdrew
into Egypt. Though God's promise would have secured him any where, yet
he would use means for his own preservation, and was content to live in
exile and obscurity for a while, being sure of a kingdom at last. And
shall not we be so, who have a better kingdom in reserve?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">kg1 11:41</span></span>

We have here the conclusion of Solomon's story, and in it, 1. Reference
is had to another history then extant, but (not being divinely inspired)
since lost, the Book of the Acts of Solomon, [Kg1
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#041.md). Probably this book was written
by a chronologer or historiographer, whom Solomon employed to write his
annals, out of which the sacred writer extracted what God saw fit to
transmit to the church. 2. A summary of the years of his reign ([Kg1
11:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#042).md): He reigned in Jerusalem (not,
as his father, part of his time in Hebron and part in Jerusalem), over
all Israel (not as his son, and his father in the beginning of his time,
over Judah only), forty years. His reign was as long as his father's,
but not his life. Sin shortened his days. 3. His death and burial, and
his successor, [Kg1 11:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#043). (1..md) He
followed his fathers to the grave, slept with them, and was buried in
David's burying-place, with honour no doubt. (2.) His son followed him
in the throne. Thus the graves are filling with the generations that go
off, and houses are filling with those that are growing up. As the grave
cries, "Give, give," so land is never lost for want of an heir.
