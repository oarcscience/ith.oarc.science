### [1 Chronicles Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 2:0</span></span>

We have now come to what was principally intended, the register of the
children of Israel, that distinguished people, that were to "dwell
alone, and not be reckoned among the nations." Here we have, I. The
names of the twelve sons of Israel ([Ch1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#001.md), [Ch1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#002).md). II. An account of the tribe of
Judah, which has the precedency, not so much for the sake of David as
for the sake of the Son of David, our Lord, who sprang out of Judah,
[Heb 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#014.md). 1. The first descendants
from Judah, down to Jesse ([Ch1
2:3-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#003).md). 2. The children of Jesse
([Ch1 2:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#013).md). 3. The posterity of
Hezron, not only through Ram, from whom David came, but through Caleb
([Ch1 2:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018).md), Segub ([Ch1
2:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#021).md), Jerahmeel ([Ch1
2:25-33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#025.md), and so to [Ch1
2:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#041).md), and more by Caleb ([Ch1
2:42-49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042).md), with the family of Caleb the
son of Hur ([Ch1 2:50-55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#050).md). The best
exposition we can have of this and the following chapters, and which
will give the clearest view of them, is found in those genealogical
tables which were published with some of the first impressions of the
last English Bible about 100 years ago, and continued for some time; and
it is a pity but they were revived in some of our later editions, for
they are of great use to those who diligently search the scriptures.
They are said to be drawn up by that great master in scripture-learning,
Mr. Hugh Broughton. We meet with them sometimes in old Bibles.

[1 Chronicles 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 2:1</span></span>

Here is, I. The family of Jacob. His twelve sons are here named, that
illustrious number so often celebrated almost throughout the whole
Bible, from the first to the last book of it. At every turn we meet with
the twelve tribes that descended from these twelve patriarchs. The
personal character of several of them was none of the best (the first
four were much blemished), and yet the covenant was entailed on their
seed; for it was of grace, free grace, that it was said, Jacob have I
loved - not of works, lest any man should boast.

II\. The family of Judah. That tribe was most praised, most increased,
and most dignified, of any of the tribes, and therefore the genealogy of
it is the first and largest of them all. In the account here given of
the first branches of that illustrious tree, of which Christ was to be
the top branch, we meet, 1. With some that were very bad. Here is Er,
Judah's eldest son, that was evil in the sight of the Lord, and was cut
off, in the beginning of his days, by a stroke of divine vengeance: The
Lord slew him, [Ch1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#003.md). His next
brother, Onan, was no better, and fared no better. Here is Tamar, with
whom Judah, her father-in-law, committed incest, [Ch1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#004.md). And here is Achan, called Achar -
a troubler, that troubled Israel by taking of the accursed thing, [Ch1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#007.md). Note, The best and most
honourable families may have those belonging to them that are blemishes.
2. With some that were very wise and good, as Heman and Ethan, Calcol
and Dara, who were not perhaps the immediate sons of Zerah, but
descendants from him, and are named because they were the glory of their
father's house; for, when the Holy Ghost would magnify the wisdom of
Solomon, he declares him wiser than these four men, who, though the sons
of Mahol, are called Ezrahites, from Zerah, [Kg1
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#031.md). That four brothers should be
eminent for wisdom and grace was a rare thing. 3. With some that were
very great, as Nahshon, who was prince of the tribe of Judah when the
camp of Israel was formed in the wilderness, and so led the van in that
glorious march, and Salman, or Salmon, who was in that post of honour
when they entered into Canaan, [Ch1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#010.md), [Ch1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#011.md).

III\. The family of Jesse, of which a particularly account is kept for
the sake of David, and the Son of David, who is a rod out of the stem of
Jesse, [Isa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md). Hence it appears
that David was a seventh son, and that his three great commanders, Joab,
Abishai, and Asahel, were the sons of one of his sisters, and Amasa of
another. Three of the four went down slain to the pit, though they were
the terror of the mighty.

[1 Chronicles 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 2:18</span></span>

The persons mentioned in the former paragraph are most of them such as
we read of, and most of them such as we read much of, in other
scriptures; but very few of those to whom this paragraph relates are
mentioned any where else. It should seem, the tribe of Judah were more
full and exact in their genealogies than any other of the tribes, in
which we must acknowledge a special providence, for the clearing of the
genealogy of Christ. 1. Here we find Bezaleel, who was head-workman in
building the tabernacle, [Exo 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#002.md). 2.
Hezron, who was the son of Pharez ([Ch1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#005).md), was the father of all this
progeny, his sons, Caleb and Jerahmeel, being very fruitful, and he
himself likewise, even in his old age, for he left his wife pregnant
when he died, [Ch1 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#024.md). This Hezron
was one of the seventy that went down with Jacob into Egypt, [Gen
46:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#012.md). There his family thus
increased, as other oppressed families there did. We cannot but suppose
that he died during the Israelites' bondage in Egypt; and yet it is here
said he died in Caleb-Ephratah (that is, Bethlehem), in the land of
Canaan, [Ch1 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#024.md). Perhaps, though the
body of the people continued in Egypt, yet some that were more active
than the rest, at least before their bondage came to be extreme, visited
Canaan sometimes and got footing there, though afterwards they lost it.
The achievements of Jair, here mentioned ([Ch1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#022.md), [Ch1
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#023).md), we had an account of in [Num
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#041.md); and, it is supposed, they were
long after the conquest of Canaan. The Jews say, Hezron married his
third wife when he was sixty years old ([Ch1
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#021).md), and another afterwards ([Ch1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#024).md), because he had a great desire
of posterity in the family of Pharez, from whom the Messiah was to
descend. 3. Here is mention of one that died without children ([Ch1
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#030).md), and another ([Ch1
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#032).md), and of one that had no sons,
but daughters, [Ch1 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#034.md). Let those
that are in any of these ways afflicted not think their case new or
singular. Providence orders these affairs of families by an
incontestable sovereignty, as pleaseth him, giving children, or
withholding them, or giving all of one sex. He is not bound to please
us, but we are bound to acquiesce in his good pleasure. To those that
love him he will himself be better than ten sons, and give them in his
house a place and a name better than of sons and daughters. Let not
those therefore that are written childless envy the families that are
built up and replenished. Shall our eye be evil because God's is good?
4. Here is mention of one who had an only daughter, and married her to
his servant an Egyptian, [Ch1 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#034.md),
[Ch1 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#035.md). If it be mentioned to his
praise, we must suppose that this Egyptian was proselyted to the Jewish
religion and that he was very eminent for wisdom and virtue, otherwise
it would not have become a true-born Israelite to match a daughter to
him, especially an only daughter. If Egyptians become converts, and
servants do worthily, neither their parentage nor their servitude should
be a bar to their preferment. Such a one this Egyptian servant might be
that she who married him might live as happily with him as if she had
married one of the rulers of her tribe. 5. The pedigree of several of
these terminates, not in a person, but in a place or country, as one is
said to be the father of Kirjath-jearim ([Ch1
2:50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#050).md), another of Bethlehem ([Ch1
2:51](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#051).md), which was afterwards David's
city, because these places fell to their lot in the division of the
land. 6. here are some that are said to be families of scribes ([Ch1
2:55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#055).md), such as kept up learning in
their family, especially scripture-learning, and taught the people the
good knowledge of God. Among all these great families we are glad to
find some that were families of scribes. Would to God that all the
Lord's people were prophets - all the families of Israel families of
scribes, well instructed to the kingdom of heaven, and able to bring out
of their treasury things new and old!
