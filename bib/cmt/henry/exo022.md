[Exodus 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 22:1</span></span>

Here are the laws,

I. Concerning theft, which are these: - 1. If a man steal any cattle (in
which the wealth of those times chiefly consisted), and they be found in
his custody, he must restore double, [Exo
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#004.md). Thus he must both satisfy for
the wrong and suffer for the crime. But it was afterwards provided that
if the thief were touched in conscience, and voluntarily confessed it,
before it was discovered or enquired into by any other, then he should
only make restitution of what he had stolen, and add to it a fifth part,
[Lev 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#004.md), [Lev
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#005.md). 2. If he had killed or sold the
sheep or ox he had stolen, and thereby persisted in his crime, he must
restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep ([Exo
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#001).md), more for an ox than for a sheep
because the owner, besides all the other profit, lost the daily labour
of his ox. This law teaches us that fraud and injustice, so far from
enriching men, will impoverish them: if we unjustly get and keep that
which is another's, it will not only waste itself, but it will consume
that which is our own. 3. If he was not able to make restitution, he
must be sold for a slave, [Exo 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#003.md).
The court of judgment was to do it, and it is probable that the person
robbed had the money. Thus with us, in some cases, felons are
transported into plantations where alone Englishmen know what slavery
is. 4. If a thief broke a house in the night, and was killed in the
doing of it, his blood was upon his own head, and should not be required
at the hand of him that shed it, [Exo
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#002.md). As he that does an unlawful act
bears the blame of the mischief that follows to others, so likewise of
that which follows to himself. A man's house is his castle, and God's
law, as well as man's, sets a guard upon it; he that assaults it does so
at his peril. Yet, if it was in the day-time that the thief was killed,
he that killed him must be accountable for it ([Exo
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#003).md), unless it was in the necessary
defence of his own life. Note, We ought to be tender of the lives even
of bad men; the magistrate must afford us redress, and we must not
avenge ourselves.

II\. Concerning trespass, [Exo 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#005.md).
He that wilfully put his cattle into his neighbour's field must make
restitution of the best of his own. Our law makes a much greater
difference between this and other thefts than the law of Moses did. The
Jews hence observed it as a general rule that restitution must always be
made of the best, and that no man should keep any cattle that were
likely to trespass upon his neighbours or do them any damage. We should
be more careful not to do wrong than not to suffer wrong, because to
suffer wrong is only an affliction, but to do wrong is a sin, and sin is
always worse than affliction.

III\. Concerning damage done by fire, [Exo
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#006.md). He that designed only the
burning of thorns might become accessory to the burning of corn, and
should not be held guiltless. Men of hot and eager spirits should take
heed, lest, while they pretend only to pluck up the tares, they root out
the wheat also. If the fire did mischief, he that kindled it must answer
for it, though it could not be proved that he designed the mischief. Men
must suffer for their carelessness, as well as for their malice. We must
take heed of beginning strife; for, though it seem but little, we know
not how great a matter it may kindle, the blame of which we must bear,
if, with the madman, we cast fire-brands, arrows, and death, and pretend
we mean no harm. It will make us very careful of ourselves, if we
consider that we are accountable, not only for the hurt we do, but for
the hurt we occasion through inadvertency.

[Exodus 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 22:7</span></span>

These laws are,

I. Concerning trusts, [Exo 22:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#007.md). If
a man deliver goods, suppose to a carrier to be conveyed, or to a
warehouse-keeper to be preserved, or cattle to a farmer to be fed, upon
a valuable consideration, and if a special confidence be reposed in the
person they are lodged with, in case these goods be stolen or lost,
perish or be damaged, if it appear that it was not by any fault of the
trustee, the owner must stand to the loss, otherwise he that has been
false to this trust must be compelled to make satisfaction. The trustee
must aver his innocence upon oath before the judges, if the case was
such as afforded no other proof, and they were to determine the matter
according as it appeared. This teaches us, 1. That we ought to be very
careful of every thing we are entrusted with, as careful of it, though
it be another's, as if it were our own. It is unjust and base, and that
which all the world cries shame on, to betray a trust. 2. That there is
such a general failing of truth and justice upon earth as gives too much
occasion to suspect men's honesty whenever it is their interest to be
dishonest. 3. That an oath for confirmation is an end of strife, [Heb
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#016.md). It is called an oath for the
Lord ([Exo 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#011).md), because to him the
appeal is made, not only as to a witness of truth, but as to an avenger
of wrong and falsehood. Those that had offered injury to their neighbour
by doing any unjust thing, yet, it might be hoped, had not so far
debauched their consciences as to profane an oath of the Lord, and call
the God of truth to be witness to a lie: perjury is a sin which natural
conscience startles at as much as any other. The religion of an oath is
very ancient, and a plain indication of the universal belief of a God,
and a providence, and a judgment to come. 4. That magistracy is an
ordinance of God, designed, among other intentions, to assist men both
in discovering rights disputed and recovering rights denied; and great
respect ought to be paid to the determination of the judges. 5. That
there is no reason why a man should suffer for that which he could not
help: masters should consider this, in dealing with their servants, and
not rebuke that as a fault which was a mischance, and which they
themselves, had they been in their servants' places, could not have
prevented.

II\. Concerning loans, [Exo 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#014.md),
[Exo 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#015). If a man (suppose.md) lent
his team to his neighbour, if the owner was with it, or was to receive
profit for the loan of it, whatever harm befel the cattle the owner must
stand to the loss of: but if the owner was so kind to the borrower as to
lend it to him gratis, and put such a confidence in him as to trust it
from under his own eye, then, if any harm happened, the borrower must
make it good. Let us learn hence to be very careful not to abuse any
thing that is lent us; it is not only unjust, but base and disingenuous,
inasmuch as it is rendering evil for good; we should much rather choose
to lose ourselves than that any should sustain loss by their kindness to
us. Alas, master! for it was borrowed, [Kg2
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#005.md).

[Exodus 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 22:16</span></span>

Here is, I. A law that he who debauched a young woman should be obliged
to marry her, [Exo 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#016.md), [Exo
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#017.md). If she was betrothed to
another, it was death to debauch her ([Deu
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#023.md), [Deu
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#024).md); but the law here mentioned
respects her as single. But, if the father refused her to him, he was to
give satisfaction in money for the injury and disgrace he had done her.
This law puts an honour upon marriage and shows likewise how improper a
thing it is that children should marry without their parents' consent:
even here, where the divine law appointed the marriage, both as a
punishment to him that had done wrong and a recompence to her that had
suffered wrong, yet there was an express reservation for the father's
power; if he denied his consent, it must be no marriage.

II\. A law which makes witchcraft a capital crime, [Exo
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#018.md). Witchcraft not only gives that
honour to the devil which is due to God alone, but bids defiance to the
divine Providence, wages war with God's government, and puts his work
into the devil's hand, expecting him to do good and evil, and so making
him indeed the god of this world; justly therefore was it punished with
death, especially among a people that were blessed with a divine
revelation, and cared for by divine Providence above any people under
the sun. By our law, consulting, covenanting with, invocating, or
employing, any evil spirit, to any intent whatsoever, and exercising any
enchantment, charm, or sorcery, whereby hurt shall be done to any person
whatsoever, is made felony, without benefit of clergy; also pretending
to tell where goods lost or stolen may be found, or the like, is an
iniquity punishable by the judge, and the second offence with death. The
justice of our law herein is supported by the law of God recorded here.

III\. Unnatural abominations are here made capital; such beasts in the
shape of men as are guilty of them are unfit to live ([Exo
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#019).md): Whosoever lies with a beast
shall die.

IV\. Idolatry is also made capital, [Exo
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#020.md). God having declared himself
jealous in this matter, the civil powers must be jealous in it too, and
utterly destroy those persons, families, and places of Israel, that
worshipped any god, save the Lord: this law might have prevented the
woeful apostasies of the Jewish nation in after times, if those that
should have executed it had not been ringleaders in the breach of it.

V. A caution against oppression. Because those who were empowered to
punish other crimes were themselves most in danger of this, God takes
the punishing of it into his own hands.

1\. Strangers must not be abused ([Exo
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#021).md), not wronged in judgment by the
magistrates, not imposed upon in contracts, nor must any advantage be
taken of their ignorance or necessity; no, nor must they be taunted,
trampled upon, treated with contempt, or upbraided with being strangers;
for all these were vexations, and would discourage strangers from coming
to live among them, or would strengthen their prejudices against their
religion, to which, by all kind and gentle methods, they should
endeavour to proselyte them. The reason given why they should be kind to
strangers is, "You were strangers in Egypt, and knew what it was to be
vexed and oppressed there," Note, (1.) Humanity is one of the laws of
religion, and obliges us particularly to be tender of those that lie
most under disadvantages and discouragements, and to extend our
compassionate concern to strangers, and those to whom we are not under
the obligations of alliance or acquaintance. Those that are strangers to
us are known to God, and he preserves them, [Psa
146:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#009). (2..md) Those that profess
religion should study to oblige strangers, that they may thereby
recommend religion to their good opinion, and take heed of doing any
thing that may tempt them to think ill of it or its professors, [Pe1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012). (3..md) Those that have themselves
been in poverty and distress, if Providence enrich and enlarge them,
ought to show a particular tenderness towards those that are now in such
circumstances as they were in formerly, doing now by them as they then
wished to be done by.

2\. Widows and fatherless must not be abused ([Exo
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#022).md): You shall not afflict them,
that is, "You shall comfort and assist them, and be ready upon all
occasions to show them kindness." In making just demands from them,
their condition must be considered, who have lost those that should deal
for them, and protect them; they are supposed to be unversed in
business, destitute of advice, timorous, and of a tender spirit, and
therefore must be treated with kindness and compassion; no advantage
must be taken against them, nor any hardship put upon them, from which a
husband or a father would have sheltered them. For, (1.) God takes
particular cognizance of their case, [Exo
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#023.md). Having no one else to complain
and appeal to, they will cry unto God, and he will be sure to hear them;
for his law and his providence are guardians to the widows and
fatherless, and if men do not pity them, and will not hear them, he
will. Note, It is a great comfort to those who are injured and oppressed
by men that they have a God to go to who will do more than give them the
hearing; and it ought to be a terror to those who are oppressive that
they have the cry of the poor against them, which God will hear. Nay,
(2.) He will severely reckon with those that do oppress them. Though
they escape punishments from men, God's righteous judgments will pursue
and overtake them, [Exo 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#024.md). Men
that have a sense of justice and honour will espouse the injured cause
of the weak and helpless; and shall not the righteous God do it? Observe
the equity of the sentence here passed upon those that oppress the
widows and fatherless: their wives shall become widows, and their
children fatherless; and the Lord is known by these judgments, which he
sometimes executes still.

[Exodus 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">exo 22:25</span></span>

Here is, I. A law against extortion in lending. 1. They must not receive
use for money from any that borrowed for necessity ([Exo
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#025).md), as in that case, [Neh
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#005.md), [Neh
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#007.md). And such provision the law made
for the preservation of estates to their families by the year of jubilee
that a people who had little concern in trade could not be supposed to
borrow money but for necessity, and therefore it is generally forbidden
among themselves; but to a stranger, whom yet they might not oppress,
they were allowed to lend upon usury: this law, therefore, in the
strictness of it, seems to have been peculiar to the Jewish state; but,
in the equity of it, it obliges us to show mercy to those of whom we
might take advantage, and to be content to share, in loss as well as
profit, with those we lend to, if Providence cross them; and, upon this
condition, it seems as lawful to receive interest for my money, which
another takes pains with and improves, but runs the hazard of, in trade,
as it is to receive rent for my land, which another takes pains with and
improves, but runs the hazard of, in husbandry. 2. They must not take a
poor man's bed-clothes in pawn; but, if they did, must restore them by
bed-time, [Exo 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#026.md), [Exo
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#027.md). Those who lie soft and warm
themselves should consider the hard and cold lodgings of many poor
people, and not do any thing to make bad worse, or to add affliction to
the afflicted.

II\. A law against the contempt of authority ([Exo
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#028).md): Thou shalt not revile the
gods, that is, the judges and magistrates, for their executing these
laws; they must do their duty, whoever suffer by it. Magistrates ought
not to fear the reproach of men, nor their revilings, but to despise
them as long as they keep a good conscience; but those that do revile
them for their being a terror to evil works and workers reflect upon God
himself, and will have a great deal to answer for another day. We find
those under a black character, and a heavy doom, that despise dominion,
and speak evil of dignities, [Jde 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#008.md).
Princes and magistrates are our fathers, whom the fifth commandment
obliges us to honour and forbids us to revile. St. Paul applies this law
to himself, and owns that he ought not to speak evil of the ruler of his
people; no, not though the ruler was then his most unrighteous
persecutor, [Act 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#005.md); see [Ecc
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#020.md).

III\. A law concerning the offering of their first-fruits to God, [Exo
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#029.md), [Exo
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#030.md). It was appointed before (ch.
13), and it is here repeated: The firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give
unto me; and much more reason have we to give ourselves, and all we
have, to God, who spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us
all. The first ripe of their corn they must not delay to offer. There is
danger, if we delay our duty, lest we wholly omit it; and by slipping
the first opportunity, in expectation of another, we suffer Satan to
cheat us of all our time. Let not young people delay to offer to God the
first-fruits of their time and strength, lest their delays come, at
last, to be denials, through the deceitfulness of sin, and the more
convenient season they promise themselves never arrive. Yet it is
provided that the firstlings of their cattle should not be dedicated to
God till they were past seven days old, for then they began to be good
for something. Note, God is the first and best, and therefore must have
the first and best.

IV\. A distinction put between the Jews and all other people: You shall
be holy men unto me; and one mark of that honourable distinction is
appointed in their diet, which was, that they should not eat any flesh
that was torn of beasts ([Exo 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#031).md),
not only because it was unwholesome, but because it was paltry, and
base, and covetous, and a thing below those who were holy men unto God,
to eat the leavings of the beasts of prey. We that are sanctified to God
must not be curious in our diet; but we must be conscientious, not
feeding ourselves without fear, but eating and drinking by rule, the
rule of sobriety, to the glory of God.
