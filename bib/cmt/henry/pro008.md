### [Proverbs Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">pro 8:0</span></span>

The word of God is two-fold, and, in both senses, is wisdom; for a word
without wisdom is of little value, and wisdom without a word is of
little use. Now, I. Divine revelation is the word and wisdom of God, and
that pure religion and undefiled which is built upon it; and of that
Solomon here speaks, recommending it to us as faithful, and well worthy
of all acceptation ([Pro 8:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#001).md). God,
by it, instructs, and governs, and blesses, the children of men. II. The
redeemer is the eternal Word and wisdom, the Logos. He is the Wisdom
that speaks to the children of men in the former part of the chapter.
All divine revelation passes through his hand, and centres in him; but
of him as the personal Wisdom, the second person in the Godhead, in the
judgment of many of the ancients, Solomon here speaks ([Pro
8:22-31](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022).md). He concludes with a repeated
charge to the children of men diligently to attend to the voice of God
in his word ([Pro 8:32-36](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#032).md).

[Proverbs 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 8:1</span></span>

The will of God revealed to us for our salvation is here largely
represented to us as easy to be known and understood, that none may have
an excuse for their ignorance or error, and as worthy to be embraced,
that none may have an excuse for their carelessness and unbelief.

I. The things revealed are easy to be known, for they belong to us and
to our children ([Deu 29:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#029).md), and we
need not soar up to heaven, or dive into the depths, to get the
knowledge of them ([Deu 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#011).md), for
they are published and proclaimed in some measure by the works of the
creation ([Psa 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001).md), more fully by
the consciences of men and the eternal reasons and rules of good and
evil, but most clearly by Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
The precepts of wisdom may easily be known; for, 1. They are proclaimed
aloud ([Pro 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#001).md): Does not Wisdom cry?
Yes, she cries aloud, and does not spare ([Isa
58:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001).md); she puts forth her voice, as
one in earnest and desirous to be heard. Jesus stood and cried, [Joh
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037.md). The curses and blessings were
read with a loud voice by the Levites, [Deu
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#014.md). And men's own hearts sometimes
speak aloud to them; there are clamours of conscience, as well as
whispers. 2. They are proclaimed from on high ([Pro
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#002).md): She stands in the top of high
places; it was from the top of Mount Sinai that the law was given, and
Christ expounded it in a sermon upon the mount. Nay, if we slight divine
revelation, we turn away from him that speaks from heaven, a high place
indeed, [Heb 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#025.md). The adulterous
woman spoke in secret, the oracles of the heathen muttered, but Wisdom
speaks openly; truth seeks no corners, but gladly appeals to the light.
3. They are proclaimed in the places of concourse, where multitudes are
gathered together, the more the better. Jesus spoke in the synagogues
and in the temple, whither the Jews always resorted, [Joh
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#020.md). Every man that passes by on the
road, of what rank or condition soever, may know what is good, and what
the Lord requires of him, if it be not his own fault. There is no speech
nor language where Wisdom's voice is not heard; her discoveries and
directions are given to all promiscuously. He that has ears to hear, let
him hear. 4. They are proclaimed where they are most needed. They are
intended for the guide of our way, and therefore are published in the
places of the paths, where many ways meet, that travellers may be shown,
if they will but ask, which is the right way, just then when they are at
a loss; thou shalt then hear the word behind thee, saying, This is the
way, [Isa 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#021.md). The foolish man known
not how to go to the city ([Ecc
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#015).md), and therefore Wisdom stands
ready to direct him, stands at the gates, at the entry of the city,
ready to tell him where the seer's house is, [Sa1
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#018.md). Nay, she follows men to their
own houses, and cries to them at the coming in at the doors, saying,
Peace be to this house; and, if the son of peace be there, it shall
certainly abide upon it. God's ministers are appointed to testify to
people both publicly and from house to house. Their own consciences
follow them with admonitions wherever they go, which they cannot be out
of the hearing of while they carry their own heads and hearts about with
them, which are a law unto themselves. 5. They are directed to the
children of men. We attend to that discourse in which we hear ourselves
named, though otherwise we should have neglected it; therefore Wisdom
speaks to us: "Unto you, O men! I call ([Pro
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#004).md), not to angels (they need not
these instructions), not to devils (they are past them), not to the
brute-creatures (they are not capable of them), but to you, O men! who
are taught more than the beasts of the earth and made wiser than the
fowls of heaven. To you is this law given, to you is the word of this
invitation, this exhortation sent. My voice is to the sons of men, who
are concerned to receive instruction, and to whom, one would think, it
should be very welcome. It is not, to you, O Jews! only, that Wisdom
cries, nor to you, O gentlemen! not to you, O scholars! but to you, O
men! O sons of men! even the meanest." 6. They are designed to make them
wise ([Pro 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#005).md); they are calculated
not only for men that are capable of wisdom, but for sinful men, fallen
men, foolish men, that need it, and are undone without it: "O you simple
ones! understand wisdom. Though you are ever so simple, Wisdom will take
you for her scholars, and not only so, but, if you will be ruled by her,
will undertake to give you an understanding heart." When sinners leave
their sins, and become truly religious, then the simple understand
wisdom.

II\. The things revealed are worthy to be known, well worthy of all
acceptation. We are concerned to hear; for, 1. They are of inestimable
value. They are excellent things ([Pro
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#006).md), princely things, so the word is.
Though they are level to the capacity of the meanest, yet there is that
in them which will be entertainment for the greatest. They are divine
and heavenly things, so excellent that, in comparison with them, all
other learning is but children's play. Things which relate to an eternal
God, an immortal soul, and an everlasting state, must needs be excellent
things. 2. They are of incontestable equity, and carry along with them
the evidence of their own goodness. They are right things ([Pro
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#006).md), all in righteousness ([Pro
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#008).md), and nothing froward or perverse
in them. All the dictates and directions of revealed religion are
consonant to, and perfective of, the light and law of nature, and there
is nothing in them that puts any hardship upon us, that lays us under
any undue restraints, unbecoming the dignity and liberty of the human
nature, nothing that we have reason to complain of. All God's precepts
concerning all things are right. 3. They are of unquestionable truth.
Wisdom's doctrines, upon which her laws are founded, are such as we may
venture our immortal souls upon: My mouth shall speak truth ([Pro
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#007).md), the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth, for it is a testimony to the world. Every word of God is
true; there are not so much as pious frauds in it, nor are we imposed
upon in that which is told us for our good. Christ is a faithful
witness, is the truth itself; wickedness (that is, lying) is an
abomination to his lips. Note, Lying is wickedness, and we should not
only refrain from it, but it should be an abomination to us, and as far
from what we say as from what God says to us. His word to us is yea, and
amen; never then let ours be yea and nay. 4. They are wonderfully
acceptable and agreeable to those who take them aright, who understand
themselves aright, who have not their judgments blinded and biassed by
the world and the flesh, are not under the power of prejudice, are
taught of God, and whose understanding he has opened, who impartially
seek knowledge, take pains for it, and have found it in the enquiries
they have hitherto made. To them, (1.) They are all plain, and not hard
to be understood. If the book is sealed, it is to those who are
willingly ignorant. If our gospel is hidden, it is hidden to those who
are lost; but to those who depart from evil, which is understanding, who
have that good understanding which those have who do the commandments,
to them they are all plain and there is nothing difficult in them. The
way of religion is a highway, and the way-faring men, though fools,
shall not err therein, [Isa 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#008.md).
Those therefore do a great wrong to the common people who deny them the
use of the scripture under pretence that they cannot understand it,
whereas it is plain for plain people. (2.) They are all right, and not
hard to be submitted to. Those who discern things that differ, who know
good and evil, readily subscribe to the rectitude of all Wisdom's
dictates, and therefore, without murmuring or disputing, govern
themselves by them.

III\. From all this he infers that the right knowledge of those things,
such as transforms us into the image of them, is to be preferred before
all the wealth of this world ([Pro
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#010.md), [Pro
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#011).md): Receive my instruction, and not
silver. Instruction must not only be heard, but received. We must bid it
welcome, receive the impressions of it, and submit to the command of it;
and this rather than choice gold, that is, 1. We must prefer religion
before riches, and look upon it that, if we have the knowledge and fear
of God in our hearts, we are really more happy and better provided for
every condition of life than if we had ever so much silver and gold.
Wisdom is in itself, and therefore must be in our account, better than
rubies. It will bring us in a better price, be to us a better portion;
show it forth, and it will be a better ornament than jewels and precious
stones of the greatest value. Whatever we can sit down and wish for of
the wealth of this world would, if we had it, be unworthy to be compared
with the advantages that attend serious godliness. 2. We must be dead to
the wealth of this world, that we may the more closely and earnestly
apply ourselves to the business of religion. We must receive instruction
as the main matter, and then be indifferent whether we receive silver or
no; nay, we must not receive it as our portion and reward, as the rich
man in his life-time received his good things.

[Proverbs 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 8:12</span></span>

Wisdom here is Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom
and knowledge; it is Christ in the word and Christ in the heart, not
only Christ revealed to us, but Christ revealed in us. It is the word of
God, the whole compass of divine revelation; it is God the Word, in whom
all divine revelation centres; it is the soul formed by the word; it is
Christ formed in the soul; it is religion in the purity and power of it.
Glorious things are here spoken of this excellent person, this excellent
thing.

I. Divine wisdom gives men good heads ([Pro
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#012).md): I Wisdom dwell with prudence,
not with carnal policy (the wisdom that is from above is contrary to
that, [Co2 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012).md), but with true
discretion, which serves for the right ordering of the conversation,
that wisdom of the prudent which is to understand his way and is in all
cases profitable to direct, the wisdom of the serpent, not only to guard
from harm, but to guide in doing food. Wisdom dwells with prudence; for
prudence is the product of religion and an ornament to religion; and
there are more witty inventions found out with the help of the
scripture, both for the right understanding of God's providences and for
the effectual countermining of Satan's devices and the doing of good in
our generation, than were ever discovered by the learning of the
philosophers or the politics of statesmen. We may apply it to Christ
himself; he dwells with prudence, for his whole undertaking is the
wisdom of God in a mystery, and in it God abounds towards us in all
wisdom and prudence. Christ found out the knowledge of that great
invention, and a costly one it was to him, man's salvation, by his
satisfaction, an admirable expedient. We had found out many inventions
for our ruin; he found out one for our recovery. The covenant of grace
is so well ordered in all things that we must conclude that he who
ordered it dwelt with prudence.

II\. It gives men good hearts, [Pro
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#013.md). True religion, consisting in the
fear of the Lord, which is the wisdom before recommended, teaches men,
1. To hate all sin, as displeasing to God and destructive to the soul:
The fear of the Lord is to hate evil, the evil way, to hate sin as sin,
and therefore to hate every false way. Wherever there is an awe of God
there is a dread of sin, as an evil, as only evil. 2. Particularly to
hate pride and passion, those two common and dangerous sins.
Conceitedness of ourselves, pride and arrogancy, are sins which Christ
hates, and so do all those who have the Spirit of Christ; every one
hates them in others, but we must hate them in ourselves. The froward
mouth, peevishness towards others, God hates, because it is such an
enemy to the peace of mankind, and therefore we should hate it. Be it
spoken to the honour of religion that, however it is unjustly accused,
it is so far from making men conceited and sour that there is nothing
more directly contrary to it than pride and passion, nor which it
teaches us more to detest.

III\. It has a great influence upon public affairs and the
well-governing of all societies, [Pro
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#014.md). Christ, as God, has strength and
wisdom; wisdom and might are his; as Redeemer, he is the wisdom of God
and the power of God. To all that are his he is made of God both
strength and wisdom; in him they are laid up for us, that we may both
know and do our duty. He is the wonderful counsellor and gives that
grace which alone is sound wisdom. He is understanding itself, and has
strength for all those that strengthen themselves in him. True religion
gives men the best counsel in all difficult cases, and helps to make
their way plain. Wherever it is, it is understanding, it has strength;
it will be all that to us that we need, both for services and
sufferings. Where the word of God dwells richly it makes a man perfect
and furnishes him thoroughly for every good word and work. Kings,
princes, and judges, have of all men most need of wisdom and strength,
of counsel and courage, for the faithful discharge of the trusts reposed
in them, and that they may be blessings to the people over whom they are
set. And therefore Wisdom says, By me kings reign ([Pro
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#015.md), [Pro
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#016).md), that is, 1. Civil government is
a divine institution, and those that are entrusted with the
administration of it have their commission from Christ; it is a branch
of his kingly office that by him kings reign; from him to whom all
judgment is committed their power is derived. They reign by him, and
therefore ought to reign for him. 2. Whatever qualifications for
government any kings or princes have they are indebted to the grace of
Christ for them; he gives them the spirit of government, and they have
nothing, no skill, no principles of justice, but what he endues them
with. A divine sentence is in the lips of the king; and kings are to
their subjects what he makes them. 3. Religion is very much the strength
and support of the civil government; it teaches subjects their duty, and
so by it kings reign over them the more easily; it teaches kings their
duty, and so by it kings reign as they ought; they decree justice, while
they rule in the fear of God. Those rule well whom religion rules.

IV\. It will make all those happy, truly happy, that receive and embrace
it.

1\. They shall be happy in the love of Christ; for he it is that says, I
love those that love me, [Pro 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#017.md).
Those that love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity shall be beloved of
him with a peculiar distinguishing love: he will love them and manifest
himself to them.

2\. They shall be happy in the success of their enquiries after him:
"Those that seek me early, seek an acquaintance with me and an interest
in me, seek me early, that is, seek me earnestly, seek me first before
any thing else, that begin betimes in the days of their youth to seek
me, they shall find what they seek." Christ shall be theirs, and they
shall be his. He never said, Seek in vain.

3\. They shall be happy in the wealth of the world, or in that which is
infinitely better. (1.) They shall have as much riches and honour as
Infinite Wisdom sees good for them ([Pro
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#018).md); they are with Christ, that is,
he has them to give, and whether he will see fit to give them to us must
be referred to him. Religion sometimes helps to make people rich and
great in this world, gains them a reputation, and so increases their
estates; and the riches which Wisdom gives to her favourites have these
two advantages: - \[1.\] That they are riches and righteousness, riches
honestly got, not by fraud and oppression, but in regular ways, and
riches charitably used, for alms are called righteousness. Those that
have their wealth from God's blessing on their industry, and that have a
heart to do good with it, have riches and righteousness. \[2.\] That
therefore they are durable riches. Wealth gotten by vanity will soon be
diminished, but that which is well got will wear well and will be left
to the children's children, and that which is well spent in works of
piety and charity is put out to the best interest and so will be
durable; for the friends made by the mammon of unrighteousness when we
fail will receive us into everlasting habitations, [Luk
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#009.md). It will be found after many
days, for the days of eternity. (2.) They shall have that which is
infinitely better, if they have not riches and honour in this world
([Pro 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#019).md): "My fruit is better than
gold, and will turn to a better account, will be of more value in less
compass, and my revenue better than the choicest silver, will serve a
better trade." We may assure ourselves that not only Wisdom's products
at last, but her income in the mean time, not only her fruit, but her
revenue, is more valuable than the best either of the possessions or of
the reversions of this world.

4\. They shall be happy in the grace of God now; that shall be their
guide in the good way, [Pro 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#020.md). This
is that fruit of wisdom which is better than gold, than fine gold, it
leads us in the way of righteousness, shows us that way and goes before
us in it, the way that God would have us walk in and which will
certainly bring us to our desired end. It leads in the midst of the
paths of judgment, and saves us from deviating on either hand. In medio
virtus - Virtue lies in the midst. Christ by his Spirit guides believers
into all truth, and so leads them in the way of righteousness, and they
walk after the Spirit.

5\. They shall be happy in the glory of God hereafter, [Pro
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#021.md). Therefore Wisdom leads in the
paths of righteousness, not only that she may keep her friends in the
way of duty and obedience, but that she may cause them to inherit
substance and may fill their treasures, which cannot be done with the
things of this world, nor with any thing less than God and heaven. The
happiness of those that love God, and devote themselves to his service,
is substantial and satisfactory. (1.) It is substantial; it is substance
itself. It is a happiness which will subsist of itself, and stand alone,
without the accidental supports of outward conveniences. Spiritual and
eternal things are the only real and substantial things. Joy in God is
substantial joy, solid and well-grounded. The promises are their bonds,
Christ is their surety, and both substantial. They inherit substance;
that is, their inheritance hereafter is substantial; it is a weight of
glory; it is substance, [Heb 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#034.md).
All their happiness they have as heirs; it is grounded upon their
sonship. (2.) It is satisfying; it will not only fill their hands, but
fill their treasures, not only maintain them, but make them rich. The
things of this world may fill men's bellies ([Psa
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014).md), but not their treasures, for
they cannot in them secure to themselves goods for many years; perhaps
they may be deprived of them this night. But let the treasures of the
soul be ever so capacious there is enough in God, and Christ, and
heaven, to fill them. In Wisdom's promises believers have goods laid up,
not for days and years, but for eternity; her fruit therefore is better
than gold.

[Proverbs 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 8:22</span></span>

That it is an intelligent and divine person that here speaks seems very
plain, and that it is not meant of a mere essential property of the
divine nature, for Wisdom here has personal properties and actions; and
that intelligent divine person can be no other than the Son of God
himself, to whom the principal things here spoken of wisdom are
attributed in other scriptures, and we must explain scripture by itself.
If Solomon himself designed only the praise of wisdom as it is an
attribute of God, by which he made the world and governs it, so to
recommend to men the study of that wisdom which belongs to them, yet the
Spirit of God, who indited what he wrote, carried him, as David often,
to such expressions as could agree to no other than the Son of God, and
would lead us into the knowledge of great things concerning him. All
divine revelation is the revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto
him, and here we are told who and what he is, as God, designed in the
eternal counsels to be the Mediator between God and man. The best
exposition of these verses we have in the first four verses of St.
John's gospel. In the beginning was the Word, etc. Concerning the Son of
God observe here,

I. His personality and distinct subsistence, one with the Father and of
the same essence, and yet a person of himself, whom the Lord possessed
([Pro 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022).md), who was set up ([Pro
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#023).md), was brought forth ([Pro
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#024.md), [Pro
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#025).md), was by him ([Pro
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#030).md), for he was the express image of
his person, [Heb 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md).

II\. His eternity; he was begotten of the Father, for the Lord possessed
him, as his own Son, his beloved Son, laid him in his bosom; he was
brought forth as the only-begotten of the Father, and this before all
worlds, which is most largely insisted upon here. The Word was eternal,
and had a being before the world, before the beginning of time; and
therefore it must follow that it was from eternity. The Lord possessed
him in the beginning of his way, of his eternal counsels, for those were
before his works. This way indeed had no beginning, for God's purposes
in himself are eternal like himself, but God speaks to us in our own
language. Wisdom explains herself ([Pro
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#023).md): I was set up from everlasting.
The Son of God was, in the eternal counsels of God, designed and
advanced to be the wisdom and power of the Father, light and life, and
all in all both in the creation and in the redemption of the world. That
he was brought forth as to his being, and set up as to the divine
counsels concerning his office, before the world was made, is here set
forth in a great variety of expressions, much the same with those by
which the eternity of God himself is expressed. [Psa
90:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#002.md), Before the mountains were
brought forth. 1. Before the earth was, and that was made in the
beginning, before man was made; therefore the second Adam had a being
before the first, for the first Adam was made of the earth, the second
had a being before the earth, and therefore is not of the earth, [Joh
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#031.md). 2. Before the sea was ([Pro
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#024).md), when there were no depths in
which the waters were gathered together, no fountains from which those
waters might arise, none of that deep on which the Spirit of God moved
for the production of the visible creation, [Gen
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002.md). 3. Before the mountains were, the
everlasting mountains, [Pro 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#025.md).
Eliphaz, to convince Job of his inability to judge of the divine
counsels, asks him ([Job 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#007).md), Wast
thou made before the hills? No, thou wast not. But before the hills was
the eternal Word brought forth. 4. Before the habitable parts of the
world, which men cultivate, and reap the profits of (v. 26), the fields
in the valleys and plains, to which the mountains are as a wall, which
are the highest part of the dust of the world; the first part of the
dust (so some), the atoms which compose the several parts of the world;
the chief or principal part of the dust, so it may be read, and
understood of man, who was made of the dust of the ground and is dust,
but is the principal part of the dust, dust enlivened, dust refined. The
eternal Word had a being before man was made, for in him was the life of
men.

III\. His agency in making the world. He not only had a being before the
world, but he was present, not as a spectator, but as the architect,
when the world was made. God silenced and humbled Job by asking him,
"Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Who hath laid
the measures thereof? ([Job 38:4](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#004.md),
etc.). Wast thou that eternal Word and wisdom, who was the prime manager
of that great affair? No; thou art of yesterday." But here the Son of
God, referring, as it should seem, to the discourse God had with Job,
declares himself to have been engaged in that which Job could not
pretend to be a witness of and a worker in, the creation of the world.
By him God made the worlds, [Eph 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009.md);
[Heb 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md); [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md). 1. When, on the first day of the
creation, in the very beginning of time, God said, Let there be light,
and with a word produced it, this eternal Wisdom was that almighty Word:
Then I was there, when he prepared the heavens, the fountain of that
light, which, whatever it is here, is there substantial. 2. He was no
less active when, on the second day, he stretched out the firmament, the
vast expanse, and set that as a compass upon the face of the depth ([Pro
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#027).md), surrounded it on all sides with
that canopy, that curtain. Or it may refer to the exact order and method
with which God framed all the parts of the universe, as the workman
marks out his work with his line and compasses. The work in nothing
varied from the plan of it formed in the eternal mind. 3. He was also
employed in the third day's work, when the waters above the heavens,
were gathered together by establishing the clouds above, and those under
the heavens by strengthening the fountains of the deep, which send forth
those waters ([Pro 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#028).md), and by
preserving the bounds of the sea, which is the receptacle of those
waters, [Pro 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#029.md). This speaks much
the honour of this eternal Wisdom, for by this instance God proves
himself a God greatly to be feared ([Jer
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#022).md) that he has placed the sand for
the bound of the sea, that the dry land might continue to appear above
water, fit to be a habitation for man; and thus he has appointed the
foundation of the earth. How able, how fit, is the Son of God to be the
Saviour of the world, who was the Creator of it!

IV\. The infinite complacency which the Father had in him, and he in the
Father ([Pro 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#030).md): I was by him, as
one brought up with him. As by an eternal generation he was brought
forth of the Father, so by an eternal counsel he was brought up with
him, which intimates, not only the infinite love of the Father to the
Son, who is therefore called the Son of his love ([Col
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#013).md), but the mutual consciousness
and good understanding that were between them concerning the work of
man's redemption, which the Son was to undertake, and about which the
counsel of peace was between them both, [Zac
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013.md). He was alumnus patris - the
Father's pupil, as I may say, trained up from eternity for that service
which in time, in the fulness of time, he was to go through with, and is
therein taken under the special tuition and protection of the Father; he
is my servant whom I uphold, [Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md). He did what he saw the Father do
([Joh 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019).md), pleased his Father,
sought his glory, did according to the commandment he received from his
Father, and all this as one brought up with him. He was daily his
Father's delight (my elect, in whom my soul delighteth, says God, [Isa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001).md), and he also rejoiced always
before him. This may be understood either, 1. Of the infinite delight
which the persons of the blessed Trinity have in each other, wherein
consists much of the happiness of the divine nature. Or, 2. Of the
pleasure which the Father took in the operations of the Son, when he
made the world; God saw every thing that the Son made, and, behold, it
was very good, it pleased him, and therefore his Son was daily, day by
day, during the six days of the creation, upon that account, his
delight, [Exo 39:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#043.md). And the Son also
did himself rejoice before him in the beauty and harmony of the whole
creation, [Psa 104:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#031.md). Or, 3. Of the
satisfaction they had in each other, with reference to the great work of
man's redemption. The Father delighted in the Son, as Mediator between
him and man, was well-pleased with what he proposed ([Mat
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017).md), and therefore loved him because
he undertook to lay down his life for the sheep; he put a confidence in
him that he would go through his work, and not fail nor fly off. The Son
also rejoiced always before him, delighted to do his will ([Psa
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008).md), adhered closely to his
undertaking, as one that was well-satisfied in it, and, when it came to
the setting to, expressed as much satisfaction in it as ever, saying,
Lo, I come, to do as in the volume of the book it is written of me.

V. The gracious concern he had for mankind, [Pro
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#031.md). Wisdom rejoiced, not so much in
the rich products of the earth, or the treasures hid in the bowels of
it, as in the habitable parts os it, for her delights were with the sons
of men; not only in the creation of man is it spoken with a particular
air of pleasure ([Gen 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026).md), Let us
make man, but in the redemption and salvation of man. The Son of God was
ordained, before the world, to that great work, [Pe1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020.md). A remnant of the sons of men
were given him to be brought, through his grace, to his glory, and these
were those in whom his delights were. His church was the habitable part
of his earth, made habitable for him, that the Lord God might dwell even
among those that had been rebellious; and this he rejoiced in, in the
prospect of seeing his seed. Though he foresaw all the difficulties he
was to meet with in his work, the services and sufferings he was to go
through, yet, because it would issue in the glory of his Father and the
salvation of those sons of men that were given him, he looked forward
upon it with the greatest satisfaction imaginable, in which we have all
the encouragement we can desire to come to him and rely upon him for all
the benefits designed us by his glorious undertaking.

[Proverbs 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">pro 8:32</span></span>

We have here the application of Wisdom's discourse; the design and
tendency of it is to bring us all into an entire subjection to the laws
of religion, to make us wise and good, not to fill our heads with
speculations, or our tongues with disputes, but to rectify what is amiss
in our hearts and lives. In order to this, here is,

I. An exhortation to hear and obey the voice of Wisdom, to attend and
comply with the good instructions that the word of God gives us, and in
them to discern the voice of Christ, as the sheep know the shepherd's
voice.

1\. We must be diligent hearers of the word; for how can we believe in
him of whom we have not heart? "Hearken unto me, O you children!" [Pro
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#032.md). "Read the word written, sit
under the word preached, bless God for both, and hear him in both
speaking to you." Let children age, and what they hearken to then, it is
likely, they will be so seasoned by as to be governed by all their days.
Let Wisdom's children justify Wisdom by hearkening to her and show
themselves to be indeed her children. We must hear Wisdom's words, (1.)
Submissively, and with a willing heart ([Pro
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#033).md): "Hear instruction, and refuse
it not, either as that which you need not or as that which you like not;
it is offered you as a kindness, and it is at your peril if you refuse
it." Those that reject the counsel of God reject it against themselves,
[Luk 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#030.md). "Refuse it not now, lest
you should not have another offer." (2.) Constantly, and with an
attentive ear. We must hear Wisdom so as to watch daily at her gates, as
beggars to receive an alms, as clients and patients to receive advice,
and to wait as servants, with humility, and patience, and ready
observance, at the posts of her doors. See here what a good house Wisdom
keeps, for every day is dole-day; what a good school, for every day is
lecture-day. While we have God's works before our eyes, and his word in
our hand, we may be every day hearing Wisdom, and learning instruction
from her. See here what a dutiful and diligent attendance is required of
all Christ's disciples; they must watch at the gates. \[1.\] We must lay
hold on all opportunities of getting knowledge and grace, and must get
into, and keep in, a constant settled course of communion with God.
\[2.\] We must be very humble in our attendance on divine instructions,
and be glad of any place, even the meanest, so we may but be within
hearing of them, as David, who would gladly be a door-keeper in the
house of God. \[3.\] We must raise our expectations of these
instructions, and hearken to them with care, and patience, and
perseverance, must watch and wait, as Christ's hearers, that hanged on
him to hear him, as the word in the original is ([Luk
19:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#048).md) and ([Luk
21:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#038).md) came early in the morning to
hear him.

2\. We must be conscientious doers of the work, for we are blessed only
in our deed. It is not enough to hearken unto Wisdom's words, but we
must keep her ways ([Pro 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#032).md), do
every thing that she prescribes, keep within the hedges of her ways, and
not transgress them, keep in the tracks of her ways, proceed and
persevere in them. "Hear instruction and be wise; let it be a means to
make you wise in ordering your conversation." What we know is known in
vain if it do not make us wise, [Pro
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#033.md).

II\. An assurance of happiness to all those that do hearken to Wisdom.
They are blessed, [Pro 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#032.md), and again
[Pro 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#034.md). Those are blessed that
watch and wait at Wisdom's gates; even their attendance there is their
happiness; it is the best place they can be in. Those are blessed that
wait there, for they shall not be put to wait long; let them continue to
knock awhile and it shall be opened to them. They are seeking Wisdom,
and they shall find what they seek. But will it make them amends if they
do find it? Yes ([Pro 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#035).md): Whoso
finds me finds life, that is, all happiness, all that good which he
needs or can desire. He finds life in that grace which is the principle
of spiritual life and the pledge of eternal life. He finds life, for he
shall obtain favour of the Lord, and in his favour is life. If the
king's favour is towards a wise son, much more the favour of the King of
kings. Christ is Wisdom, and he that finds Christ, that obtains an
interest in him, he finds life; for Christ is life to all believers. He
that has the Son of God has life, eternal life, and he shall obtain
favour of the Lord, who is well-pleased with all those that are in
Christ; nor can we obtain God's favour, unless we find Christ and be
found in him.

III\. The doom passed upon all those that reject Wisdom and her
proposals, [Pro 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#036.md). They are left to
ruin themselves, and Wisdom will not hinder them, because they have set
at nought all her counsel. 1. Their crime is very great; they sin
against Wisdom, rebel against its light and laws, thwart its designs,
and by their folly offend it. They sin against Christ; they act in
contempt of his authority, and in contradiction to all the purposes of
his life and death. This is construed into hating Wisdom, hating Christ;
they are his enemies, who will not have him to reign over them. What can
appear worse than hating him who is the centre of all beauty and
fountain of all goodness, love itself? 2. Their punishment will be very
just, for they wilfully bring it upon themselves. (1.) Those that offend
Christ do the greatest wrong to themselves; they wrong their own souls;
they wound their own consciences, bring a blot and stain upon their
souls, which renders them odious in the eyes of God, and unfit for
communion with him; they deceive themselves, disturb themselves, destroy
themselves. Sin is a wrong to the soul. (2.) Those that are at variance
with Christ are in love with their own ruin: Those that hate me love
death; they love that which will be their death, and put that from them
which would be their life. Sinners die because they will die, which
leaves them inexcusable, makes their condemnation the more intolerable,
and will for ever justify God when he judges. O Israel! thou hast
destroyed thyself.
