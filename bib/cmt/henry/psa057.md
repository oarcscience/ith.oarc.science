### [Psalms Chapter 57](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 57:0</span></span>

This psalm is very much like that which goes next before it; it was
penned upon a like occasion, when David was both in danger of trouble
and in temptation to sin; it begins as that did, "Be merciful to me;"
the method also is the same. I. He begins with prayer and complaint, yet
not without some assurance of speeding in his request ([Psa
57:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001).md). II. He concludes with joy and
praise ([Psa 57:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007).md). So that hence
we may take direction and encouragement, both in our supplications and
in our thanksgivings, and may offer both to God, in singing this psalm.

To the chief musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David, when he fled from
Saul in the cave.

[Psalms 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 57:1</span></span>

The title of this psalm has one word new in it, Al-taschith - Destroy
not. Some make it to be only some known tune to which this psalm was
set; others apply it to the occasion and matter of the psalm. Destroy
not; that is, David would not let Saul be destroyed, when now in the
cave there was a fair opportunity of killing him, and his servants would
fain have done so. No, says David, destroy him not, [Sa1
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#004.md), [Sa1
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#006.md). Or, rather, God would not let
David be destroyed by Saul; he suffered him to persecute David, but
still under this limitation, Destroy him hot; as he permitted Satan to
afflict Job, Only save his life. David must not be destroyed, for a
blessing is in him ([Isa 65:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#008).md), even
Christ, the best of blessings. When David was in the cave, in imminent
peril, he here tells us what were the workings of his heart towards God;
and happy are those that have such good thoughts as these in their minds
when they are in danger!

I. He supports himself with faith and hope in God, and prayer to him,
[Psa 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md), [Psa
57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002.md). Seeing himself surrounded with
enemies, he looks up to God with that suitable prayer: Be merciful to
me, O Lord! which he again repeats, and it is no vain repetition: Be
merciful unto me. It was the publican's prayer, [Luk
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#013.md). It is a pity that any should
use it slightly and profanely, should cry, God be merciful to us, or,
Lord, have mercy upon us, when they mean only to express their wonder,
or surprise, or vexation, but God and his mercy are not in all their
thoughts. It is with much devout affection that David here prays, "Be
merciful unto me, O Lord! look with compassion upon me, and in thy love
and pity redeem me." To recommend himself to God's mercy, he here
professes,

1\. That all his dependence is upon God: My soul trusteth in thee, [Psa
57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md). He did not only profess to trust
in God, but his soul did indeed rely on God only, with a sincere
devotion and self-dedication, and an entire complacency and
satisfaction. He goes to God, and, at the footstool of the throne of his
grace, humbly professes his confidence in him: In the shadow of thy
wings will I make my refuge, as the chickens take shelter under the
wings of the hen when the birds of prey are ready to strike at them,
until these calamities be over-past. (1.) He was confident his troubles
would end well, in due time; these calamities will be over-past; the
storm will blow over. Non si male nunc et olim sic erit - Though now
distressed, I shall not always be so. Our Lord Jesus comforted himself
with this in his sufferings, [Luk
22:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#037.md). The things concerning me have
an end. (2.) He was very easy under the divine protection in the mean
time. \[1.\] He comforted himself in the goodness of God's nature, by
which he is inclined to succour and protect his people, as the hen is by
instinct to shelter her young ones. God comes upon the wing to the help
of his people, which denotes a speedy deliverance ([Psa
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010).md); and he takes them under his
wing, which denotes warmth and refreshment, even when the calamities are
upon them; see [Mat 23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md). \[2.\] In
the promise of his word and the covenant of his grace; for it may refer
to the out-stretched wings of the cherubim, between which God is said to
dwell ([Psa 80:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001).md) and whence he gave
his oracles. "To God, as the God of grace, will I fly, and his promise
shall be my refuge, and a sure passport it will be through all these
danger." God, by his promise, offers himself to us, to be trusted; we by
our faith must accept of him, and put our trust in him.

2\. That all his desire is towards God ([Psa
57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002).md): "I will cry unto God most high,
for succour and relief; to him that is most high will I lift up my soul,
and pray earnestly, even unto God that performs all things for me."
Note, (1.) In every thing that befalls us we ought to see and own the
hand of God; whatever is done is of his performing; in it his counsel is
accomplished and the scripture is fulfilled. (2.) Whatever God performs
concerning his people, it will appear, in the issue, to have been
performed for them and for their benefit. Though God be high, most high,
yet he condescends so low as to take care that all things be made to
work for good to them. (3.) This is a good reason why we should, in all
our straits and difficulties, cry unto him, not only pray, but pray
earnestly.

3\. That all his expectation is from God ([Psa
57:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003).md): He shall send from heaven, and
save me. Those that make God their only refuge, and fly to him by faith
and prayer, may be sure of salvation, in his way and time. Observe here,
(1.) Whence he expects the salvation - from heaven. Look which way he
will, in this earth, refuge fails, no help appears; but he looks for it
from heaven. Those that lift up their hearts to things above may thence
expect all good. (2.) What the salvation is that he expects. He trusts
that God will save him from the reproach of those that would swallow him
up, that aimed to ruin him, and, in the mean time, did all they could to
vex him. Some read it, He shall send from heaven and save me, for he has
put to shame him that would swallow me up; he has disappointed their
designs against me hitherto, and therefore he will perfect my
deliverance. (3.) What he will ascribe his salvation to: God shall send
forth his mercy and truth. God is good in himself and faithful to every
word that he has spoken, and so he makes it appear when he works
deliverance for his people. We need no more to make us happy than to
have the benefit of the mercy and truth of God, [Psa
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#010.md).

II\. He represents the power and malice of his enemies ([Psa
57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004).md): My soul is among lions. So
fierce and furious was Saul, and those about him, against David, that he
might have been as safe in a den of lions as among such men, who were
continually roaring against him and ready to make a prey of him. They
are set on fire, and breathe nothing but flame; they set on fire the
course of nature, inflaming one another against David, and they were
themselves set on fire of hell, [Jam
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#006.md). They were sons of men, from whom
one might have expected something of the reason and compassion of a man;
but they were beasts of prey in the shape of men; their teeth, which
they gnashed upon him, and with which they hoped to tear him to pieces
and to eat him up, were spears and arrows fitted for mischiefs and
murders; and their tongue, with which they cursed him and wounded his
reputation, was as a sharp sword to cut and kill; see [Psa
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#010.md). A spiteful tongue is a
dangerous weapon, wherewith Satan's instruments fight against God's
people. He describes their malicious projects against him ([Psa
57:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#006).md) and shows the issue of them:
"They have prepared a net for my steps, in which to take me, that I
might not again escape out of their hands; they have digged a pit before
me, that I might, ere I was aware, run headlong into it." See the
policies of the church's enemies; see the pains they take to do
mischief. But let us see what comes of it. 1. It is indeed some
disturbance to David: My soul is bowed down. It made him droop, and hang
the head, to think that there should be those that bore him so much
ill-will. But, 2. It was destruction to themselves; they dug a pit for
David, into the midst whereof they have fallen. The mischief they
designed against David returned upon themselves, and they were
embarrassed in their counsels; then when Saul was pursuing David the
Philistines were invading him; nay, in the cave, when Saul thought David
should fall into his hands, he fell into the hands of David, and lay at
his mercy.

III\. He prays to God to glorify himself and his own great name ([Psa
57:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#005).md): "Whatever becomes of me and my
interest, be thou exalted, O God! above the heavens, be thou praised by
the holy angels, those glorious inhabitants of the upper world; and let
thy glory be above or over all the earth; let all the inhabitants of
this earth be brought to know and praise thee." Thus God's glory should
lie hearer our hearts, and we should be more concerned for it, than for
any particular interests of our own. When David was in the greatest
distress and disgrace he did not pray, Lord, exalt me, but, Lord, exalt
thy own name. Thus the Son of David, when his soul was troubled, and he
prayed, Father, save me from this hour, immediately withdrew that
petition, and presented this in the room of it, For this cause came I to
this hour; Father, glorify thy name, [Joh
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#027.md), [Joh
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#028.md). Or it may be taken as a plea to
enforce his petition for deliverance: "Lord, send from heaven to save
me, and thereby thou wilt glorify thyself as the God both of heaven and
earth." Our best encouragement in prayer is taken from the glory of God,
and to that therefore, more than our own comfort, we should have an eye
in all our petitions for particular mercies; for this is made the first
petition in the Lord's prayer, as that which regulates and directs all
the rest, Father in heaven, hallowed by thy name.

[Psalms 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 57:7</span></span>

How strangely is the tune altered here! David's prayers and complaints,
by the lively actings of faith, are here, all of a sudden, turned into
praises and thanksgivings; his sackcloth is loosed, he is girded with
gladness, and his hallelujahs are as fervent as his hosannas. This
should make us in love with prayer, that, sooner or later, it will be
swallowed up in praise. Observe,

I. How he prepares himself for the duty of praise ([Psa
57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007).md): My heart is fixed, O God! my
heart is fixed. My heart is erect, or lifted up (so some), which was
bowed down, [Psa 57:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#006.md). My heart is
fixed, 1. With reference to God's providences; it is prepared for every
event, being stayed upon God, [Psa
112:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#007.md); [Isa
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#003.md). My heart is fixed, and then none
of these things move me, [Act 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#024.md).
If by the grace of God we be brought into this even composed frame of
spirit, we have great reason to be thankful. 2. With reference to the
worship of God: My heart is fixed to sing and give praise. It is implied
that the heart is the main thing required in all acts of devotion;
nothing is done to purpose, in religion, further than it is done with
the heart. The heart must be fixed, fixed for the duty, fitted and put
in frame for it, fixed in the duty by a close application, attending on
the Lord without distraction.

II\. How he excites himself to the duty of praise ([Psa
57:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#008).md): Awake up my glory, that is, my
tongue (our tongue is our glory, and never more so than when it is
employed in praising God), or my soul, that must be first awakened; dull
and sleepy devotions will never be acceptable to God. We must stir up
ourselves, and all that is within us, to praise God; with a holy fire
must that sacrifice be kindled, and ascend in a holy flame. David's
tongue will lead, and his psaltery and harp will follow, in these hymns
of praise. I myself will awake, not only, "I will not be dead, and
drowsy, and careless, in this work," but, "I will be in the most lively
frame, as one newly awakened out of a refreshing sleep." He will awake
early to this work, early in the morning, to begin the day with God,
early in the beginnings of a mercy. When God is coming towards us with
his favours we must go forth to meet him with our praises.

III\. How he pleases himself, and (as I may say) even prides himself, in
the work of praise; so far is he from being ashamed to own his
obligations to God, and dependence upon him, that he resolves to praise
him among the people and to sing unto him among the nations, [Psa
57:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#009.md). This intimates, 1. That his own
heart was much affected and enlarged in praising God; he would even make
the earth ring with his sacred songs, that all might take notice how
much he thought himself indebted to the goodness of God. 2. That he
desired to bring others in to join with him in praising God. He will
publish God's praises among the people, that the knowledge, and fear,
and love of God might be propagated, and the ends of the earth might see
his salvation. When David was driven out into heathen lands he would not
only not worship their gods, but he would openly avow his veneration for
the God of Israel, would take his religion along with him wherever he
went, would endeavour to bring others in love with it, and leave the
sweet savour of it behind him. David, in his psalms, which fill the
universal church, and will to the end of time, may be said to be still
praising God among the people and singing to him among the nations; for
all good people make use of his words in praising God. Thus St. John, in
his writings, is said to prophesy again before many peoples and nations,
[Rev 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#011.md).

IV\. How he furnishes himself with matter for praise, [Psa
57:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#010.md). That which was the matter of
his hope and comfort (God shall send forth his mercy and his truth, [Psa
57:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003).md) is here the matter of his
thanksgiving: Thy mercy is great unto the heavens, great beyond
conception and expression; and thy truth unto the clouds, great beyond
discovery, for what eye can reach that which is wrapped up in the
clouds? God's mercy and truth reach to the heavens, for they will bring
all such to heaven as lay up their treasure in them and build their
hopes upon them. God's mercy and truth are praised even to the heavens,
that is, by all the bright and blessed inhabitants of the upper world,
who are continually exalting God's praises to the highest, while David,
on earth, is endeavouring to spread his praises to the furthest, [Psa
57:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#009.md).

V. How he leaves it at last to God to glorify his own name ([Psa
57:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#011).md): Be thou exalted, O God! The
same words which he had used ([Psa
57:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#005).md) to sum up his prayers in he here
uses again (and no vain repetition) to sum up his praises in: "Lord, I
desire to exalt thy name, and that all the creatures may exalt it; but
what can the best of us do towards it? Lord, take the work into thy own
hands; do it thyself: Be thou exalted, O God! In the praises of the
church triumphant thou art exalted to the heavens, and in the praises of
the church militant thy glory is throughout all the earth; but thou art
above all the blessing and praise of both ([Neh
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#005).md), and therefore, Lord, exalt
thyself above the heavens and above all the earth. Father, glorify thy
own name. Thou hast glorified it, glorify it yet again."
