### [Job Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 35:0</span></span>

Job being still silent, Elihu follows his blow, and here, a third time,
undertakes to show him that he had spoken amiss, and ought to recant.
Three improper sayings he here charges him with, and returns answer to
them distinctly: - I. He had represented religion as an indifferent
unprofitable thing, which God enjoins for his own sake, not for ours;
Elihu evinces the contrary ([Job
35:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#001).md). II. He had complained of God
as deaf to the cries of the oppressed, against which imputation Elihu
here justifies God ([Job 35:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#009).md).
III. He had despaired of the return of God's favour to him, because it
was so long deferred, but Elihu shows him the true cause of the delay
([Job 35:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#014).md).

[Job 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 35:1</span></span>

We have here,

I. The bad words which Elihu charges upon Job, [Job
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#002.md), [Job
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#003.md). To evince the badness of them he
appeals to Job himself, and his own sober thoughts, in the reflection:
Thinkest thou this to be right? This intimates Elihu's confidence that
the reproof he now gave was just, for he could refer the judgment of it
even to Job himself. Those that have truth and equity on their side
sooner or later will have every man's conscience on their side. It also
intimates his good opinion of Job, that he thought better than he spoke,
and that, though he had spoken amiss, yet, when he perceived his
mistake, he would not stand to it. When we have said, in our haste, that
which was not right, it becomes us to own that our second thoughts
convince us that it was wrong. Two things Elihu here reproves Job for: -
1. For justifying himself more than God, which was the thing that first
provoked him, [Job 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#002.md). "Thou hast,
in effect, said, My righteousness is more than God's," that is, "I have
done more for God than ever he did for me; so that, when the accounts
are balanced, he will be brought in debtor to me." As if Job thought his
services had been paid less than they deserved and his sins punished
more than they deserved, which is a most unjust and wicked thought for
any man to harbour and especially to utter. When Job insisted so much
upon his own integrity, and the severity of God's dealings with him, he
did in effect say, My righteousness is more than God's; whereas, though
we be ever so good and our afflictions ever so great, we are chargeable
with unrighteousness and God is not. 2. For disowning the benefits and
advantages of religion because he suffered these things: What profit
shall I have if I be cleansed from my sin? [Job
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#003.md). This is gathered from [Job
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#030.md), [Job
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#031.md). Though I make my hands ever so
clean, what the nearer am I? Thou shalt plunge me in the ditch. And [Job
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#015.md), If I be wicked, woe to me; but,
if I be righteous, it is all the same. The psalmist, when he compared
his own afflictions with the prosperity of the wicked, was tempted to
say, Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, [Psa
73:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#013.md). And, if Job said so, he did in
effect say, My righteousness is more than God's ([Job
35:9](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#009).md); for, if he got nothing by his
religion, God was more beholden to him than he was to God. But, though
there might be some colour for it, yet it was not fair to charge these
words upon Job, when he himself had made them the wicked words of
prospering sinners ([Job 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#015.md), What
profit shall we have if we pray to him?) and had immediately disclaimed
them. The counsel of the wicked is far from me, [Job
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#016.md). It is not a fair way of
disputing to charge men with those consequences of their opinions which
they expressly renounce.

II\. The good answer which Elihu gives to this ([Job
35:4](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#004).md): "I will undertake to answer
thee, and thy companions with thee," that is, "all those that approve
thy sayings and are ready to justify thee in them, and all others that
say as thou sayest: "I have that to offer which will silence them all."
To do this he has recourse to his old maxim ([Job
33:12](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#012).md), that God is greater than man.
This is a truth which, if duly improved, will serve many good purposes,
and particularly this to prove that God is debtor to no man. The
greatest of men may be a debtor to the meanest; but such is the infinite
disproportion between God and man that the great God cannot possibly
receive any benefit by man, and therefore cannot be supposed to lie
under any obligation to man; for, if he be obliged by his purpose and
promise, it is only to himself. That is a challenge which no man can
take up ([Rom 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#035).md), Who hath first
given to God, let him prove it, and it shall be recompensed to him
again. Why should we demand it, as a just debt, to gain by our religion
(as Job seemed to do), when the God we serve does not gain by it? 1.
Elihu needs not prove that God is above man; it is agreed by all; but he
endeavours to affect Job and us with it, by an ocular demonstration of
the height of the heavens and the clouds, [Job
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#005.md). They are far above us, and God
is far above them; how much then is he set out of the reach either of
our sins or of our services! Look unto the heavens, and behold the
clouds. God made man erect, coelumque tueri jussit - and bade him look
up to heaven. Idolaters looked up, and worshipped the hosts of heaven,
the sun, moon, and stars; but we must look up to heaven, and worship the
Lord of those hosts. They are higher than we, but God is infinitely
above them. His glory is above the heavens ([Psa
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001).md) and the knowledge of him higher
than heaven, [Job 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#008.md). 2. But hence
he infers that God is not affected, either one way or other, by any
thing that we do. (1.) He owns that men may be either bettered or
damaged by what we do ([Job 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#008).md): Thy
wickedness, perhaps, may hurt a man as thou art, may occasion him
trouble in his outward concerns. A wicked man may wound, or rob, or
slander his neighbour, or may draw him into sin and so prejudice his
soul. Thy righteousness, thy justice, thy charity, thy wisdom, thy
piety, may perhaps profit the son of man. Our goodness extends to the
saints that are in the earth, [Psa
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003.md). To men like ourselves we are in
a capacity either of doing injury or of showing kindness; and in both
these the sovereign Lord and Judge of all will interest himself, will
reward those that do good and punish those that do hurt to their
fellow-creatures and fellow-subjects. But, (2.) He utterly denies that
God can really be either prejudiced or advantaged by what any, even the
greatest men of the earth, do, or can do. \[1.\] The sins of the worst
sinners are no damage to him ([Job
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#006).md): "If thou sinnest wilfully, and
of malice prepense, against him, with a high hand, nay, if thy
transgressions be multiplied, and the acts of sin be ever so often
repeated, yet what doest thou against him?" This is a challenge to the
carnal mind, and defies the most daring sinner to do his worst. It
speaks much for the greatness and glory of God that it is not in the
power of his worst enemies to do him any real prejudice. Sin is said to
be against God because so the sinner intends it and so God takes it, and
it is an injury to his honour; yet it cannot do any thing against him.
The malice of sinners is impotent malice: it cannot destroy his being or
perfections, cannot dethrone him from his power and dominion, cannot
disturb his peace and repose, cannot defeat his counsels and designs,
nor can it derogate from his essential glory. Job therefore spoke amiss
in saying What profit is it that I am cleansed from my sin? God was no
gainer by his reformation; and who then would gain if he himself did
not? \[2.\] The services of the best saints are no profit to him ([Job
35:7](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#007).md): If thou be righteous, what
givest thou to him? He needs not our service; or, if he did want to have
the work done, he has better hands than ours at command. Our religion
brings no accession at all to his felicity. He is so far from being
beholden to us that we are beholden to him for making us righteous and
accepting our righteousness; and therefore we can demand nothing from
him, nor have any reason to complain if we have not what we expect, but
to be thankful that we have better than we deserve.

[Job 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 35:9</span></span>

Elihu here returns an answer to another word that Job had said, which,
he thought, reflected much upon the justice and goodness of God, and
therefore ought not to pass without a remark. Observe,

I. What it was that Job complained of; it was this, That God did not
regard the cries of the oppressed against their oppressors ([Job
35:9](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#009).md): "By reason of the multitude of
oppressions, the many hardships which proud tyrants put upon poor people
and the barbarous usage they give them, they make the oppressed to cry;
but it is to no purpose: God does not appear to right them. They cry
out, they cry on still, by reason of the arm of the mighty, which lies
heavily upon them." This seems to refer to those words of Job ([Job
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#012).md), Men groan from out of the
city, and the soul of the wounded cries out against the oppressors, yet
God lays not folly to them, does not reckon with them for it. This is a
thing that Job knows not what to make of, nor how to reconcile to the
justice of God and his government. Is there a righteous God, and can it
be that he should so slowly hear, so slowly see?

II\. How Elihu solves the difficulty. If the cries of the oppressed be
not heard, the fault is not in God; he is ready to hear and help them.
But the fault is in themselves; they ask and have not, but it is because
they ask amiss, [Jam 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#003.md). They cry out
by reason of the arm of the mighty, but it is a complaining cry, a
wailing cry, not a penitent praying cry, the cry of nature and passion,
not of grace. See [Hos 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#014.md), They have
not cried unto me with their heart when they howled upon their beds. How
then can we expect that they should be answered and relieved?

1\. They do not enquire after God, nor seek to acquaint themselves with
him, under their affliction ([Job
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#010).md): But none saith, Where is God
my Maker? Afflictions are sent to direct and quicken us to enquire early
after God, [Psa 78:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#034.md). But many that
groan under great oppressions never mind God, nor take notice of his
hand in their troubles; if they did, they would bear their troubles more
patiently and be more benefited by them. Of the many that are afflicted
and oppressed, few get the good they might get by their affliction. It
should drive them to God, but how seldom is this the case! It is
lamentable to see so little religion among the poor and miserable part
of mankind. Every one complains of his troubles; but none saith, Where
is God my Maker? that is, none repent of their sins, none return to him
that smites them, none seek the face and favour of God, and that comfort
in him which would balance their outward afflictions. They are wholly
taken up with the wretchedness of their condition, as if that would
excuse them in living without God in the world which should engage them
to cleave the more closely to him. Observe, (1.) God is our Maker, the
author of our being, and, under that notion, it concerns us to regard
and remember him, [Ecc 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#001.md). God my
makers, in the plural number, which some think is, if not an indication,
yet an intimation, of the Trinity of persons in the unity of the
Godhead. Let us make man. (2.) It is our duty therefore to enquire after
him. Where is he, that we may pay our homage to him, may own our
dependence upon him and obligations to him? Where is he, that we may
apply to him for maintenance and protection, may receive law from him,
and may seek our happiness in his favour, from whose power we received
our being? (3.) It is to be lamented that he is so little enquired after
by the children of men. All are asking, Where is mirth? Where is wealth?
Where is a good bargain? But none ask, Where is God my Maker?

2\. They do not take notice of the mercies they enjoy in and under their
afflictions, nor are thankful for them, and therefore cannot expect that
God should deliver them out of their afflictions. (1.) He provides for
our inward comfort and joy under our outward troubles, and we ought to
make use of that, and wait his time for the removal of our troubles: He
gives songs in the night, that is, when our condition is ever so dark,
and sad, and melancholy, there is that in God, in his providence and
promise, which is sufficient, not only to support us, but to fill us
with joy and consolation, and enable us in every thing to give thanks,
and even to rejoice in tribulation. When we only pore upon the
afflictions we are under, and neglect the consolations of God which are
treasured up for us, it is just with God to reject our prayers. (2.) He
preserves to us the use of our reason and understanding ([Job
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#011).md): Who teaches us more than the
beasts of the earth, that is, who has endued us with more noble powers
and faculties than they are endued with and has made us capable of more
excellent pleasures and employments here and for ever. Now this comes in
here, \[1.\] As that which furnishes us with matter for thanksgiving,
even under the heaviest burden of affliction. Whatever we are deprived
of, we have our immortal souls, those jewels of more worth than all the
world, continued to us; even those that kill the body cannot hurt them.
And if our affliction prevail not to disturb the exercise of their
faculties, but we enjoy the use of our reason and the peace of our
consciences, we have much reason to be thankful, how pressing soever our
calamities otherwise are. \[2.\] As a reason why we should, under our
afflictions, enquire after God our Maker, and seek unto him. This is the
greatest excellency of reason, that it makes us capable of religion, and
it is in that especially that we are taught more than the beasts and the
fowls. They have wonderful instincts and sagacities in seeking out their
food, their physic, their shelter; but none of them are capable of
enquiring, Where is God my Maker? Something like logic, and philosophy,
and politics, has been observed among the brute-creatures, but never any
thing of divinity or religion; these are peculiar to man. If therefore
the oppressed only cry by reason of the arm of the mighty, and do not
look up to God, they do no more than the brutes (who complain when they
are hurt), and they forget that instruction and wisdom by which they are
advanced so far above them. God relieves the brute-creatures because
they cry to him according to the best of their capacity, [Job
38:41](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#041.md); [Psa
104:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#021.md). But what reason have men to
expect relief, who are capable of enquiring after God as their Maker and
yet cry to him no otherwise than as brutes do?

3\. They are proud and unhumbled under their afflictions, which were
sent to mortify them and to hide pride from them ([Job
35:12](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#012).md): There they cry - there they
lie exclaiming against their oppressors, and filling the ears of all
about them with their complaints, not sparing to reflect upon God
himself and his providence - but none gives answer. God does not work
deliverance for them, and perhaps men do not much regard them; and why
so? It is because of the pride of evil men; they are evil men; they
regard iniquity in their hearts, and therefore God will not hear their
prayers, [Psa 66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018.md); [Isa
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015.md). God hears not such sinners. They
have, it may be, brought themselves into trouble by their own
wickedness; they are the devil's poor; and then who can pity them? Yet
this is not all: they are proud still, and therefore they do not seek
unto God ([Psa 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#004).md), or, if they do
cry unto him, therefore he does not give answer, for he hears only the
desire of the humble ([Psa 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017).md) and
delivers those by his providence whom he has first by his grace prepared
and made fit for deliverance, which we are not if, under humbling
afflictions, our hearts remain unhumbled and our pride unmortified. The
case is plain then, If we cry to God for the removal of the oppression
and affliction we are under, and it is not removed, the reason is not
because the Lord's hand is shortened or his ear heavy, but because the
affliction has not done its work; we are not sufficiently humbled, and
therefore must thank ourselves that it is continued.

4\. They are not sincere, and upright, and inward with God, in their
supplications to him, and therefore he does not hear and answer them
([Job 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#013).md): God will not hear
vanity, that is, the hypocritical prayer, which is a vain prayer, coming
out of feigned lips. It is a vanity to think that God should hear it,
who searches the heart and requires truth in the inward part.

[Job 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 35:14</span></span>

Here is, I. Another improper word for which Elihu reproves Job ([Job
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#014).md): Thou sayest thou shalt not see
him; that is, 1. "Thou complainest that thou dost not understand the
meaning of his severe dealings with thee, nor discern the drift and
design of them," [Job 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#008.md), [Job
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#009.md). And, 2. "Thou despairest of
seeing his gracious returns to thee, of seeing better days again, and
art ready to give up all for gone;" as Hezekiah ([Isa
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#011).md), I shall not see the Lord. As,
when we are in prosperity, we are ready to think our mountain will never
be brought low, so when we are in adversity we are ready to think our
valley will never be filled, but, in both, to conclude that to morrow
must be as this day, which is as absurd as to think, when the weather is
either fair or foul, that is will be always so, that the flowing tide
will always flow, or the ebbing tide will always ebb.

II\. The answer which Elihu gives to this despairing word that Job had
said, which is this, 1. That, when he looked up to God, he had no just
reason to speak thus despairingly: Judgment is before him, that is, "He
knows what he has to do, and will do all in infinite wisdom and justice;
he has the entire plan and model of providence before him, and knows
what he will do, which we do not, and therefore we understand not what
he does. There is a day of judgment before him, when all the seeming
disorders of providence will be set to rights and the dark chapters of
it will be expounded. Then thou shalt see the full meaning of these dark
events, and the final period of these dismal events; then thou shalt see
his face with joy; therefore trust in him, depend upon him, wait for
him, and believe that the issue will be good at last." When we consider
that God is infinitely wise, and righteous, and faithful, and that he is
a God of judgment ([Isa 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#018).md), we
shall see no reason to despair of relief from him, but all the reason in
the world to hope in him, that it will come in due time, in the best
time. 2. That if he had not yet seen an end of his troubles, the reason
was because he did not thus trust in God and wait for him ([Job
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#015).md): "Because it is not so, because
thou dost not thus trust in him, therefore the affliction which came at
first from love has now displeasure mixed with it. Now God has visited
thee in his anger, taking it very ill that thou canst not find in thy
heart to trust him, but harbourest such hard misgiving thoughts of him."
If there be any mixtures of divine wrath in our afflictions, we may
thank ourselves; it is because we do not behave aright under them; we
quarrel with God, and are fretful and impatient, and distrustful of the
divine Providence. This was Job's case. The foolishness of man perverts
his way, and then his heart frets against the Lord, [Pro
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#003.md). Yet Elihu thinks that Job, being
in great extremity, did not know and consider this as he should, that it
was his own fault that he was not yet delivered. He concludes therefore
that Job opens his mouth in vain ([Job
35:16](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#016).md) in complaining of his
grievances and crying for redress, or in justifying himself and clearing
up his own innocency; it is all in vain, because he does not trust in
God and wait for him, and has not a due regard to him in his
afflictions. He had said a great deal, had multiplied words, but all
without knowledge, all to no purpose, because he did not encourage
himself in God and humble himself before him. It is in vain for us
either to appeal to God or to acquit ourselves if we do not study to
answer the end for which affliction is sent, and in vain to pray for
relief if we do not trust in God; for let not that man who distrusts God
think that he shall receive any thing from him, [Jam
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#007.md). Or this may refer to all that Job
had said. Having shown the absurdity of some passages in his discourse,
he concludes that there were many other passages which were in like
manner the fruits of his ignorance and mistake. He did not, as his other
friends, condemn him for a hypocrite, but charged him only with Moses's
sin, speaking unadvisedly with his lips when his spirit was provoked.
When at any time we do so (and who is there that offends not in word?)
it is a mercy to be told of it, and we must take it patiently and kindly
as Job did, not repeating, but recanting, what we have said amiss.
