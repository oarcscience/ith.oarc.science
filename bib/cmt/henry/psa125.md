### [Psalms Chapter 125](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 125:0</span></span>

This short psalm may be summed up in those words of the prophet ([Isa
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010.md), [Isa
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#011).md), "Say you to the righteous, It
shall be well with him. Woe to the wicked, it shall be will with him."
Thus are life and death, the blessing and the curse, set before us often
in the psalms, as well as in the law and the prophets. I. It is
certainly well with the people of God; for, 1. They have the promises of
a good God that they shall be fixed ([Psa
125:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001).md), and safe ([Psa
125:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#002).md), and not always under the
hatches ([Psa 125:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#003).md). 2. They have the
prayers of a good man, which shall be heard for them ([Psa
125:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#004).md). II. It is certainly ill with
the wicked, and particularly with the apostates ([Psa
125:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#005).md). Some of the Jewish rabbies are
of opinion that it has reference to the days of the Messiah; however, we
that are members of the gospel-church may certainly, in singing this
psalm, take comfort of these promises, and the more so if we stand in
awe of the threatening.

A song of degrees.

[Psalms 125:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 125:1</span></span>

Here are three very precious promises made to the people of God, which,
though they are designed to secure the welfare of the church in general,
may be applied by particular believers to themselves, as other promises
of this nature may. Here is,

I. The character of God's people, to whom these promises belong. Many
call themselves God's people who have no part nor lot in this matter.
But those shall have the benefit of them and may take the comfort of
them, (1.) Who are righteous ([Psa
125:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#003).md), righteous before God,
righteous to God, and righteous to all men, for his sake justified and
sanctified. (2.) Who trust in the Lord, who depend upon his care and
devote themselves to his honour. All that deal with God must deal upon
trust, and he will give comfort to those only that give credit to him,
and make it to appear they do so by quitting other confidences, and
venturing to the utmost for God. The closer our expectations are
confined to God the higher our expectations may be raised from him.

II\. The promises themselves.

1\. That their hearts shall be established by faith: those minds shall
be truly stayed that are stayed on God: They shall be as Mount Zion. The
church in general is called Mount Zion ([Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022).md), and it shall in this respect
be like Mount Zion, it shall be built upon a rock, and its interests
shall be so well secured that the gates of hell shall not prevail
against it. The stability of the church is the satisfaction of all its
well-wishers. Particular persons, who trust in God, shall be established
([Psa 112:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#007).md); their faith shall be
their fixation, [Isa 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#009.md). They shall
be as Mount Zion, which is firm as it is a mountain supported by
providence, much more as a holy mountain supported by promise. (1.) They
cannot be removed by the prince of the power of the air, nor by all his
subtlety and strength. They cannot be removed from their integrity nor
from their confidence in God. (2.) They abide for ever in that grace
which is the earnest of their everlasting continuance in glory.

2\. That, committing themselves to God, they shall be safe, under his
protection, from all the insults of their enemies, as Jerusalem had a
natural fastness and fortification in the mountains that were round
about it, [Psa 125:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#002.md). Those mountains
not only sheltered it from winds and tempests, and broke the force of
them, but made it also very difficult of access for an enemy; such a
defence is God's providence to his people. Observe, (1.) The compass of
it: The Lord is round about his people on every side. There is no gap in
the hedge of protection which he makes round about his people, at which
the enemy, who goes about them, seeking to do them a mischief, can find
entrance, [Job 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#010). (2..md) The
continuance of it - henceforth even for ever. Mountains may moulder and
come to nought, and rocks be removed out of their place ([Job
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#018).md), but God's covenant with his
people cannot be broken ([Isa 54:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#010).md)
nor his care of them cease. Their being said to stand fast for ever
([Psa 125:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001).md), and here to have God
round about them for ever, intimates that the promises of the stability
and security of God's people will have their full accomplishment in
their everlasting state. In heaven they shall stand fast for ever, shall
be as pillars in the temple of our God and go no more out ([Rev
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012).md), and there God himself, with his
glory and favour, will be round about them for ever.

3\. That their troubles shall last no longer than their strength will
serve to bear them up under them, [Psa
125:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#003). (1..md) It is supposed that the
rod of the wicked may come, may fall, upon the lot of the righteous. The
rod of their power may oppress them; the rod of their anger may vex and
torment them. It may fall upon their persons, their estates, their
liberties, their families, their names, any thing that falls to their
lot, only it cannot reach their souls. (2.) It is promised that, though
it may come upon their lot, it shall not rest there; it shall not
continue so long as the enemies design, and as the people of God fear,
but God will cut the work short in righteousness, so short that even
with the temptation he will make a way for them to escape. (3.) It is
considered as a reason of this promise that if the trouble should
continue over-long the righteous themselves would be in temptation to
put forth their hands to iniquity, to join with wicked people in their
wicked practices, to say as they say and do as they do. There is danger
lest, being long persecuted for their religion, at length they grow
weary of it and willing to give it up, lest, being kept long in
expectation of promised mercies, they begin to distrust the promise, and
to think of casting God off, upon suspicion of his having cast them off.
See [Psa 73:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#013.md), [Psa
73:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#014.md). Note, God considers the frame
of his people, and will proportion their trials to their strength by the
care of his providence, as well as their strength to their trials by the
power of his grace. Oppression makes a wise man mad, especially if it
continue long; therefore for the elect's sake the days shall be
shortened, that, whatever becomes of their lot in this world, they may
not lose their lot among the chosen.

[Psalms 125:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 125:4</span></span>

Here is, 1. The prayer the psalmist puts up for the happiness of those
that are sincere and constant ([Psa
125:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#004).md): Do good, O Lord! unto those
that are good. This teaches us to pray for all good people, to make
supplication for all saints; and we may pray in faith for them, being
assured that those who do well shall certainly be well dealt with. Those
that are as they should be shall be as they would be, provided they be
upright in heart, that they be really as good as they seem to be. With
the upright God will show himself upright. He does not say, Do good, O
Lord! to those that are perfect, that are sinless and spotless, but to
those that are sincere and honest. God's promises should quicken our
prayers. It is comfortable wishing well to those for whom God has
engaged to do well. 2. The prospect he has of the ruin of hypocrites and
deserters; he does not pray for it (I have not desired the woeful day,
thou knowest), but he predicts it: As for those, who having known the
way of righteousness, for fear of the rod of the wicked, basely turn
aside out of it to their wicked ways, use indirect ways to prevent
trouble or extricate themselves out of it, or those who, instead of
reforming, grow worse and worse and are more obstinate and daring in
their impieties, God shall send them away, cast them out, and lead them
forth with the workers of iniquity, that is, he will appoint them their
portion with the worst of sinners. Note, (1.) Sinful ways are crooked
ways; sin is the perverting of that which is right. (2.) The doom of
those who turn aside to those crooked ways out of the right way will be
the same with theirs who have all along walked in them, nay, and more
grievous, for if any place in hell be hotter than another that shall be
the portion of hypocrites and apostates. God shall lead them forth, as
prisoners are led forth to execution. Go, you cursed, into everlasting
fire; and these shall go away; all their former righteousness shall not
be mentioned unto them. The last words, Place upon Israel, may be taken
as a prayer: "God preserve his Israel in peace, when his judgments are
abroad reckoning with evil-doers." We read them as a promise: Peace
shall be upon Israel; that is, \[1.\] When those who have treacherously
deserted the ways of God meet with their own destruction those who
faithfully adhere to them, though they may have trouble in their way,
shall have peace in the end. \[2.\] The destruction of those who walk in
crooked ways will contribute to the peace and safety of the church. When
Herod was cut off the word of God grew, [Act
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#023.md), [Act
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#024.md). \[3.\] The peace and happiness
of God's Israel will be the vexation, and will add much to the torment,
of those who perish in their wickedness, [Luk
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#028.md); [Isa
65:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#013.md). My servants shall rejoice, but
you shall be ashamed.
