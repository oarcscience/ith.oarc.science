### [Jeremiah Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 29:0</span></span>

The contest between Jeremiah and the false prophets was carried on
before by preaching, here by writing; there we had sermon against
sermon, here we have letter against letter, for some of the false
prophets are now carried away into captivity in Babylon, while Jeremiah
remains in his own country. Now here is, I. A letter which Jeremiah
wrote to the captives in Babylon, against their prophets that they had
there ([Jer 29:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#001).md), in which letter,
1. He endeavours to reconcile them to their captivity, to be easy under
it and to make the best of it ([Jer
29:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#004).md). 2. He cautions them not to
give any credit to their false prophets, who fed them with hopes of a
speedy release ([Jer 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#008.md), [Jer
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#009).md). 3. He assures them that God
would restore them in mercy to their own land again, at the end of 70
years ([Jer 29:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010).md). 4. He foretels
the destruction of those who yet continued, and that they should be
persecuted with one judgment after another, and sent at last into
captivity ([Jer 29:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#015).md). 5. He
prophesies the destruction of two of their false prophets that they had
in Babylon, that both soothed them up in their sins and set them bad
examples ([Jer 29:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#020).md), and this is
the purport of Jeremiah's letter. II. Here is a letter which Shemaiah, a
false prophet in Babylon, wrote to the priests at Jerusalem, to stir
them up to persecute Jeremiah ([Jer
29:24-29](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#024).md), and a denunciation of God's
wrath against him for writing such a letter ([Jer
29:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#030).md). Such struggles as these
have there always been between the seed of the woman and the seed of the
serpent.

[Jeremiah 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 29:1</span></span>

We are here told,

I. That Jeremiah wrote to the captives in Babylon, in the name of the
Lord. Jeconiah had surrendered himself a prisoner, with the queen his
mother, the chamberlains of his household, called here the eunuchs, and
many of the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, who were at that time the
most active men; the carpenters and smiths likewise, being demanded,
were yielded up, that those who remained might not have any proper hands
to fortify their city or furnish themselves with weapons of war. By this
tame submission it was hoped that Nebuchadnezzar would be pacified.
Satis est prostrasse leoni - It suffices the lion to have laid his
antagonist prostrate; but the imperious conqueror grows upon their
concessions, like Benhadad upon Ahab's, [Kg1
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#005.md), [Kg1
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#006.md). And, not content with this, when
these had departed from Jerusalem he comes again, and fetches away many
more of the elders, the priests, the prophets, and the people ([Jer
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#001).md), such as he thought fit, or such
as his soldiers could lay hands on, and carries them to Babylon. The
case of these captives was very melancholy, the rather because they,
being thus distinguished from the rest of their brethren who continued
in their own land, looked as if they were greater sinners than all men
who dwelt at Jerusalem. Jeremiah therefore writes a letter to them, to
comfort them, assuring them that they had no reason either to despair of
succour themselves or to envy their brethren that were left behind.
Note, 1. The word of God written is as truly given by inspiration of God
as his word spoken was; and this was the proper way of spreading the
knowledge of God's will among his children scattered abroad. 2. We may
serve God and do good by writing to our friends at a distance pious
letters of seasonable comforts and wholesome counsels. Those whom we
cannot speak to we may write to; that which is written remains. This
letter of Jeremiah's was sent to the captives in Babylon by the hands of
the ambassadors whom king Zedekiah sent to Nebuchadnezzar, probably to
pay him his tribute and renew his submission to him, or to treat of
peace with him, in which treaty the captives might perhaps hope that
they should be included, [Jer 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#003.md). By
such messengers Jeremiah chose to send this message, to put an honour
upon it, because it was a message from God, or perhaps because there was
no settled way of sending letters to Babylon, but as such an occasion as
this offered, and then it made the condition of the captives there the
more melancholy, that they could rarely hear from their friends and
relations they had left behind, which is some reviving and satisfaction
to those that are separated from one another.

II\. We are here told what he wrote. A copy of the letter at large
follows here to [Jer 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#024.md). In these
verses,

1\. He assures them that he wrote in the name of the Lord of hosts, the
God of Israel, who indited the letter; Jeremiah was but the scribe or
amanuensis. It would be comfortable to them, in their captivity, to hear
that God is the Lord of hosts, of all hosts, and is therefore able to
help and deliver them; and that he is the God of Israel still, a God in
covenant with his people, though he contend with them, and their enemies
for the present are too hard for them. This would likewise be an
admonition to them to stand upon their guard against all temptations to
the idolatry of Babylon, because the God of Israel, the God whom they
served, is Lord of hosts. God's sending to them in this letter might be
an encouragement to them in their captivity, as it was an evidence that
he had not cast them off, had not abandoned them and disinherited them,
though he was displeased with them and corrected them; for, if the Lord
had been pleased to kill them, he would not have written to them.

2\. God by him owns the hand he had in their captivity: I have caused
you to be carried away, [Jer 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#004.md) and
again, [Jer 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#007.md). All the force of the
king of Babylon could not have done it if God had not ordered it; nor
could he have any power against them but what was given him from above.
If God caused them to be carried captives, they might be sure that he
neither did them any wrong nor meant them any hurt. Note, It will help
very much to reconcile us to our troubles, and to make us patient under
them, to consider that they are what God has appointed us to. I opened
not my mouth, because thou didst it.

3\. He bids them think of nothing but settling there; and therefore let
them resolve to make the best of it ([Jer
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#005.md), [Jer
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#006).md): Build yourselves houses and
dwell in them, etc. By all this it is intimated to them, (1.) That they
must not feed themselves with hopes of a speedy return out of their
captivity, for that would keep them still unsettled and consequently
uneasy; they would apply themselves to no business, take no comfort, but
be always tiring themselves and provoking their conquerors with the
expectations of relief; and their disappointment at last would sink them
into despair and make their condition much more miserable than otherwise
it would be. Let them therefore reckon upon a continuance there, and
accommodate themselves to it as well as they can. Let them build, and
plant, and marry, and dispose of their children there as if they were at
home in their own land. Let them take a pleasure in seeing their
families built up and multiplied; for, though they must expect
themselves to die in captivity, yet their children may live to see
better days. If they live in the fear of God, what should hinder them
but they may live comfortably in Babylon? They cannot but weep sometimes
when they remember Zion. But let not weeping hinder sowing; let them not
sorrow as those that have no hope, no joy; for they have both. Note, In
all conditions of life it is our wisdom and duty to make the best of
that which is, and not to throw away the comfort of what we may have
because we have not all we would have. We have a natural affection for
our native country; it strangely draws our minds; but it is with a
nescio qua dulcedine - we can give no good account of the sweet
attraction; and therefore, if providence remove us to some other
country, we must resolve to live easy there, to bring our mind to our
condition when our condition is not in every thing to our mind. If the
earth be the Lord's, then, wherever a child of God goes, he does not go
off his Father's ground. Patria est ubicunque bene est - That place is
our country in which we are well off. If things be not as they have
been, instead of fretting at that, we must live in hopes that they will
be better than they are. Non si male nunc, et olim sic erit - Though we
suffer now we shall not always. (2.) That they must not disquiet
themselves with fears of intolerable hardships in their captivity. They
might be ready to suggest (as persons in trouble are always apt to make
the worst of things) that it would be in vain to build houses, for their
lords and masters would not suffer them to dwell in them when they had
built them, nor to eat the fruit of the vineyards they planted. "Never
fear," says God; "if you live peaceably with them, you shall find them
civil to you." Meek and quiet people, that work and mind their own
business, have often found much better treatment, even with strangers
and enemies, than they expected; and God has made his people to be
pitied of those that carry them captives ([Psa
106:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#046).md), and a pity it is but that
those who have built houses should dwell in them. Nay,

4\. He directs them to seek the good of the country where they were
captives ([Jer 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#007).md), to pray for it,
to endeavour to promote it. This forbids them to attempt any thing
against the public peace while they were subjects to the king of
Babylon. Though he was a heathen, an idolater, an oppressor, and an
enemy to God and his church, yet, while he gave them protection, they
must pay him allegiance, and live quiet and peaceable lives under him,
in all godliness and honesty, not plotting to shake off his yoke, but
patiently leaving it to God in due time to work deliverance for them.
Nay, they must pray to God for the peace of the places where they were,
that they might oblige them to continue their kindness to them and
disprove the character that had been given their nation, that they were
hurtful to kings and provinces, and moved sedition, [Ezr
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#015.md). Both the wisdom of the serpent
and the innocency of the dove required them to be true to the government
they lived under: For in the peace thereof you shall have peace; should
the country be embroiled in war, they would have the greatest share in
the calamitous effects of it. Thus the primitive Christians, according
to the temper of their holy religion, prayed for the powers that were,
though they were persecuting powers. And, if they were to pray for and
seek the peace of the land of their captivity, much more reason have we
to pray for the welfare of the land of our nativity, where we are a free
people under a good government, that in the peace thereof we and ours
may have peace. Every passenger is concerned in the safety of the ship.

[Jeremiah 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 29:8</span></span>

To make the people quiet and easy in their captivity,

I. God takes them off from building upon the false foundation which
their pretended prophets laid, [Jer
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#008.md), [Jer
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#009.md). They told them that their
captivity should be short, and therefore that they must not think of
taking root in Babylon, but be upon the wing to go back: "Now herein
they deceive you," says God; "they prophesy a lie to you, though they
prophesy in my name. But let them not deceive you, suffer not yourselves
to be deluded by them." As long as we have the word of truth to try the
spirits by it is our own fault if we be deceived; for by it we may be
undeceived. Hearken not to your dreams, which you cause to be dreamed.
He means either the dreams or fancies which the people pleased
themselves with, and with which they filled their own heads (by thinking
and speaking of nothing else but a speedy enlargement when they were
awake they caused themselves to dream of it when they were asleep, and
then took that for a good omen, and with it strengthened themselves in
their vain expectations), or the dreams which the prophets dreamed and
grounded their prophecies upon. God tells the people, They are your
dreams, because they pleased them, were the dreams that they desired and
wished for. They caused them to be dreamed; for they hearkened to them,
and encouraged the prophets to put such deceits upon them, desiring them
to prophesy nothing but smooth things, [Isa
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#010.md). They were dreams of their own
bespeaking. False prophets would not flatter people in their sins, but
that they love to be flattered, and speak smoothly to their prophets
that their prophets may speak smoothly to them.

II\. He gives them a good foundation to build their hopes upon. We would
not persuade people to pull down the house they have built upon the
sand, but that there is a rock ready for them to rebuild upon. God here
promises them that, though they should not return quickly, they should
return at length, after seventy years be accomplished. By this it
appears that the seventy years of the captivity are not to be reckoned
from the last captivity, but the first. Note, Though the deliverance of
the church do not come in our time, it is sufficient that it will come
in God's time, and we are sure that that is the best time. The promise
is that God will visit them in mercy; though he had long seemed to be
strange to them, he will come among them, and appear for them, and put
honour upon them, as great men do upon their inferiors by coming to
visit them. He will put an end to their captivity, and turn away all the
calamities of it. Though they are dispersed, some in one country and
some in another, he will gather them from all the places whither they
are driven, will set up a standard for them all to resort to, and
incorporate them again in one body. And though they are at a great
distance they shall be brought again to their own land, to the place
whence they were carried captive, [Jer
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#014.md). Now, 1. This shall be the
performance of God's promise to them ([Jer
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010).md): I will perform my good word
towards you. Let not the failing of those predictions which are
delivered as from God lessen the reputation of those that really are
from him. That which is indeed God's word is a good word, and therefore
it will be made good, and not one iota or tittle of it shall fall to the
ground. Hath he said, and shall he not do it? This will make their
return out of captivity very comfortable, that it will be the
performance of God's good word to them, the product of a gracious
promise. 2. This shall be in pursuance of God's purposes concerning them
([Jer 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#011).md): I know the thoughts that
I think towards you. Known unto God are all his works, for known unto
him are all his thoughts ([Act 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#018).md)
and his works agree exactly with his thoughts; he does all according to
the counsel of his will. We often do not know our own thoughts, nor know
our own mind, but God is never at any uncertainty within himself. We are
sometimes ready to fear that God's designs concerning us are all against
us; but he knows the contrary concerning his own people, that they are
thoughts of good and not of evil; even that which seems evil is designed
for good. His thoughts are all working towards the expected end, which
he will give in due time. The end they expect will come, though perhaps
not when they expect it. Let them have patience till the fruit is ripe,
and then they shall have it. He will give them an end, and expectation,
so it is in the original. (1.) He will give them to see the end (the
comfortable termination) of their trouble; though it last long, it shall
not last always. The time to favour Zion, yea, the set time, will come.
When things are at the worst they will begin to mend; and he will give
them to see the glorious perfection of their deliverance; for, as for
God, his work is perfect. He that in the beginning finished the heavens
and the earth, and all the hosts of both, will finish all the blessings
of both to his people. When he begins in ways of mercy he will make an
end. God does nothing by halves. (2.) He will give them to see the
expectation, that end which they desire and hope for, and have been long
waiting for. He will give them, not the expectations of their fears, nor
the expectations of their fancies, but the expectations of their faith,
the end which he has promised and which will turn for the best to them.
3. This shall be in answer to their prayers and supplications to God,
[Jer 29:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#012). (1..md) God will stir them
up to pray: Then shall you call upon me, and you shall go, and pray unto
me. Note, When God is about to give his people the expected good he
pours out a spirit of prayer, and it is a good sign that he is coming
towards them in mercy. Then, when you see the expected end approaching,
then you shall call upon me. Note, Promises are given, not to supersede,
but to quicken and encourage prayer: and when deliverance is coming we
must by prayer go forth to meet it. When Daniel understood that the 70
years were near expiring, then he set his face with more fervency than
ever to seek the Lord, [Dan 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002.md), [Dan
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#003). (2..md) He will then stir up himself
to come and save them ([Psa 80:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#002).md): I
will hearken unto you, and I will be found of you. God has said it, and
we may depend upon it, Seek and you shall find. We have a general rule
laid down ([Jer 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#013).md): You shall find
me when you shall search for me with all your heart. In seeking God we
must search for him, accomplish a diligent search, search for directions
in seeking him and encouragements to our faith and hope. We must
continue seeking, and take pains in seeking, as those that search; and
this we must do with our heart (that is, in sincerity and uprightness),
and with our whole heart (that is, with vigour and fervency, putting
forth all that is within us in prayer), and those who thus seek God
shall find him, and shall find him their bountiful rewarder, [Heb
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006.md). He never said to such, Seek you
me in vain.

[Jeremiah 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 29:15</span></span>

Jeremiah, having given great encouragement to those among the captives
whom he knew to be serious and well-affected, assuring them that God had
very kind and favourable intentions concerning them, here turns to those
among them who slighted the counsels and comforts that Jeremiah
ministered to them and depended upon what the false prophets flattered
them with. When this letter came from Jeremiah they would be ready to
say, "Why should he make himself so busy, and take upon him to advise
us? The Lord has raised us up prophets in Babylon, [Jer
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#015.md). We are satisfied with those
prophets, and can depend upon them, and have no occasion to hear from
any prophets in Jerusalem." See the impudent wickedness of this people;
as the prophets, when they prophesied lies, said that they had them from
God, so the people, when they invited those prophets thus to flatter
them, fathered it upon God, and said that it was the Lord that raised
them up those prophets. Whereas we may be sure that those who harden
people in their sins, and deceive them with false and groundless hopes
of God's mercy, are no prophets of God's raising up. These prophets of
their own told them that no more should be carried captive, but that
those who were in captivity should shortly return. Now, in answer to
this, 1. The prophet here foretells the utter destruction of those who
remained still at Jerusalem, notwithstanding what those false prophets
said to the contrary: "As for the king and people that dwell in the
city, who, you think, will be ready to bid you welcome when you return,
you are deceived; they shall be followed with one judgment after
another, sword, famine, and pestilence, which shall cut off multitudes;
and the poor and miserable remains shall be removed into all kingdoms of
the earth," [Jer 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#016.md), [Jer
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#018.md). And thus God will make them, or
rather deal with them accordingly, as the salt that has lost its savour,
which, being good for nothing, is cast to the dunghill, and so are
rotten figs. This refers to the vision and the prophecy upon it which we
had [Jer 24:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md). And the reason given
for these proceedings against them is the same that has often been given
and will justify God in the eternal ruin of impenitent sinners ([Jer
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#019).md): Because they have not
hearkened to my words. I called, but they refused. 2. He foretells the
judgment of God upon the false prophets in Babylon, who deceived the
people of God there. He calls upon all the children of the captivity,
who boasted of them as prophets of God's raising up ([Jer
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#020).md): "Stand still, and hear the
doom of the prophets you are so fond of." The two prophets are named
here, Ahab and Zedekiah, [Jer 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#021.md).
Observe, (1.) The crimes charged upon them - impiety and immorality:
They prophesied lies in God's name ([Jer
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#021).md), and again ([Jer
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#023).md), They have spoken lying words
in my name. Lying was bad, lying to the people of God to delude them
into a false hope was worse, but fathering their lies upon the God of
truth was worst of all. And no marvel if those that had the face to do
that could allow themselves in the gratification of those vile
affections to which God, in a way of righteous judgment, gave them up.
They have done villainy in Israel, for they have committed adultery with
their neighbours' wives. Adultery is villainy in Israel, and in such as
pretend to be prophets, who by such wickednesses manifestly disprove
their own pretensions. God never sent such profligate wretches on his
errands. He is the Lord God of the holy prophets, not of such impure
ones. Here it appears why they flattered others in their sins - because
they could not reprove them without condemning themselves. These lewd
practices of theirs they knew how to conceal from the eye of the world,
that they might preserve their credit; but I know it and am a witness,
saith the Lord. The most secret sins are known to God; he can see the
villainy that is covered with the thickest cloak of hypocrisy, and there
is a day coming when he will bring to light all these hidden works of
darkness and every man will appear in his own colours. (2.) The
judgments threatened against them: The king of Babylon shall slay them
before your eyes; nay, he shall put them to a miserable death, roast
them in the fire, [Jer 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#022.md). We may
suppose that it was not for their impiety and immorality that
Nebuchadnezzar punished them thus severely, but for sedition, and some
attempts of their turbulent spirits upon the public peace, and stirring
up the people to revolt and rebel. So much of their wickedness shall
then be detected, and in such a wretched manner they shall end their
days, that their names shall be a curse among the captives in Babylon,
[Jer 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#022.md). When men would imprecate
the greatest evil upon one they hated they would think they could not
load them with a heavier curse, in fewer words, than to say, The Lord
make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab. Thus were they made ashamed of
the prophets they had been proud of, and convinced at last of their
folly in hearkening to them. God's faithful prophets were sometimes
charged with being the troublers of the land, and as such were tortured
and slain; but their names were a blessing when they were gone and their
memory sweet, not as these false prophets. As malefactors are attended
with infamy and disgrace, so martyrs with glory and honour.

[Jeremiah 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 29:24</span></span>

We have perused the contents of Jeremiah's letter to the captives in
Babylon, who had reason, with a great deal of thanks to God and him, to
acknowledge the receipt of it, and lay it up among their treasures. But
we cannot wonder if the false prophets they had among them were enraged
at it; for it gave them their true character. Now here we are told
concerning one of them,

I. How he manifested his malice against Jeremiah. this busy fellow is
called Shemaiah the Nehelamite, the dreamer (so the margin reads it),
because all his prophecies he pretended to have received from God in a
dream. He had got a copy of Jeremiah's letter to the captives, or had
heard it read, or information was given to him concerning it, and it
nettled him exceedingly; and he will take pen in hand, and answer it,
yea, that he will. But how? He does not write to Jeremiah in
justification of his own mission, nor offer any rational arguments for
the support of his prophecies concerning the speedy return of the
captives; but he writes to the priests, those faithful patrons of the
false prophets, and instigates them to persecute Jeremiah. He writes in
his own name, not so much as pretending to have the people's consent to
it; but, as if he must be dictator to all mankind, he sends a circular
letter (as it should seem) among the priests at Jerusalem and the rest
of the people, probably by the same messengers that brought the letter
from Jeremiah. But it is chiefly directed to Zephaniah, who was either
the immediate son of Maaseiah, or of the 24th course of the priests, of
which Maaseiah was the father and head. He was not the high priest, but
sagan or suffragan to the high priest, or in some other considerable
post of command in the temple, as Pashur, [Jer
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001.md). Perhaps he was chairman of that
committee of priests that was appointed in a particular manner to take
cognizance of those that pretended to be prophets, of which there were
very many at this time, and to give judgment concerning them. Now, 1. He
puts him and the other priests in mind of the duty of their place ([Jer
29:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#026).md): The Lord hath made thee priest
instead of Jehoiada the priest. Some think that he refers to the famous
Jehoiada, that great reformer in the days of Joash; and (says Mr.
Gataker) he would insinuate that this Zephaniah is for spirit and zeal
such another as he, and raised up, as he was, for the glory of God and
the good of the church; and therefore it was expected from him that he
should proceed against Jeremiah. Thus (says he) there is no act so
injurious or impious, but that wicked wretches and false prophets will
not only attempt it, but colour it also with some specious pretence of
piety and zeal for God's glory, [Isa
66:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005.md); [Joh
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#002.md). Or, rather, it was some other
Jehoiada, his immediate predecessor in this office, who perhaps was
carried to Babylon among the priests, [Jer
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#001.md). Zephaniah is advanced, sooner
than he expected, to this place of trust and power, and Shemaiah would
have him think that Providence had preferred him that he might persecute
God's prophets, that he had come to this government for such a time as
this, and that he was unjust and ungrateful if he did not thus improve
his power, or, rather, abuse it. Their hearts are wretchedly hardened
who can justify the doing of mischief by their having a power to do it.
These priests' business was to examine every man that is mad and makes
himself a prophet. God's faithful prophets are here represented as
prophets of their own making, usurpers of the office, and lay-intruders,
as men that were mad, actuated by some demon, and not divinely inspired,
or as distracted men and men in a frenzy. Thus the characters of the
false prophets are thrown upon the true ones; and, if this had been
indeed their character, they would have deserved to be bound as madmen
and punished as pretenders, and therefore he concludes that Jeremiah
must be so treated. He does not bid them examine whether Jeremiah could
produce any proofs of his mission and could make it to appear that he
was not mad. No; that is taken for granted, and, when once he has had a
bad name given him, he must be run down of course. 2. He informs them of
the letter which Jeremiah had written to the captives ([Jer
29:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#028).md): He sent unto us in Babylon,
with the authority of a prophet, saying, This captivity is long, and
therefore resolve to make the best of it. And what harm was there in
this, that it should be objected to him as a crime? The false prophets
had formerly said that the captivity would never come, [Jer
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#013.md). Jeremiah had said that it would
come, and the event had already proved him in the right, which obliged
them to give credit to him who now said that it would be long, rather
than to those who said that it would be short, but had once before been
found liars. 3. He demands judgment against him, taking it for granted
that he is mad, and makes himself a prophet. He expects that they will
order him to be put in prison and in the stocks ([Jer
29:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#026).md), that they will thus punish
him, and by putting him to disgrace possess the people with prejudices
against him, ruin his reputation, and so prevent the giving of any
credit to his prophecies at Jerusalem, hoping that, if they could gain
that point, the captives in Babylon would not be influenced by him. Nay,
he takes upon him to chide Zephaniah for his neglect ([Jer
29:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#027).md): Why hast thou not rebuked and
restrained Jeremiah of Anathoth? See how insolent and imperious these
false prophets had grown, that, though they were in captivity, they
would give law to the priests who were not only at liberty, but in
power. It is common for those that pretend to more knowledge than their
neighbours to be thus assuming. Now here is a remarkable instance of the
hardness of the hearts of sinners, and it is enough to make us all fear
lest our hearts be at any time hardened. For here we find, (1.) That
these sinners would not be convinced by the clearest evidence. God had
confirmed his word in the mouth of Jeremiah; it had taken hold of them
([Zac 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#006).md); and yet, because he does
not prophesy to them the smooth things they desired, they are resolved
to look upon him as not duly called to the office of a prophet. None so
blind as those that will not see. (2.) That they would not be reclaimed
and reformed by the most severe chastisement. They were now sent into a
miserable thraldom for mocking the messengers of the Lord and misusing
his prophets. This was the sin for which God now contended with them;
and yet in their distress they trespass yet more against the Lord, [Ch2
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#022.md). This very sin they are
notoriously guilty of in their captivity, which shows that afflictions
will not of themselves cure men of their sins, unless the grace of God
work with them, but will rather exasperate the corruptions they are
intended to mortify; so true is that of Solomon ([Pro
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#022).md), Though thou shouldst bray a
fool in a mortar, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.

II\. How Jeremiah came to the knowledge of this ([Jer
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#029).md): Zephaniah read this letter in
the ears of Jeremiah. He did not design to do as Shemaiah would have
him, but, as it should seem, had a respect for Jeremiah (for we find him
employed in messages to him as a prophet, [Jer
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md), [Jer
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#003).md), and therefore protected him. He
that continued in his dignity and power stood more in awe of God and his
judgments than he that was now a captive. Nay, he made Jeremiah
acquainted with the contents of the letter, that he might see what
enemies he had even among the captives. Note, It is kindness to our
friends to let them know their foes.

III\. What was the sentence passed upon Shemaiah for writing this
letter. God sent him an answer, for to him Jeremiah committed his cause:
it was ordered to be sent not to him, but to those of the captivity, who
encouraged and countenanced him as if he had been a prophet of God's
raising up, [Jer 29:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#031.md), [Jer
29:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#032.md). Let them know, 1. That Shemaiah
had made fools of them. He promised them peace in God's name, but God
did not send him; he forged a commission, and counterfeited the broad
seal of Heaven to it, and made the people to trust in a lie, and by
preaching false comfort to them deprived them of true comfort. Nay, he
had not only made fools of them, but, which was worse, he had made
traitors of them; he had taught rebellion against the Lord, as Hananiah
had done, [Jer 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#016.md). And, if
vengeance shall be taken on those that rebel, much more on those that
teach rebellion by their doctrine and example. 2. That at his end he
shall also be a fool (as the expression is, [Jer
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#011).md); his name and family shall be
extinct and shall be buried in oblivion; he shall leave no issue behind
him to bear up his name; his pedigree shall end in him: He shall not
have a man to dwell among this people; and neither he nor any that come
from him shall behold the good that I will do for my people. Note, Those
are unworthy to share in God's favours to his church that are not
willing to stay his time for them. Shemaiah was angry at Jeremiah's
advice to the captives to see to the building up of their families in
Babylon, that they might be increased and not diminished, and therefore
justly is he written childless there. Those that slight the blessings of
God's word deserve to lose the benefit of them. See [Amo
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#016.md), [Amo
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#017.md).
