### [Psalms Chapter 98](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 98:0</span></span>

This psalm is to the same purport with the two foregoing psalms; it is a
prophecy of the kingdom of the Messiah, the settling of it up in the
world, and the bringing of the Gentiles into it. The Chaldee entitles it
a prophetic psalm. It sets forth, I. The glory of the Redeemer ([Psa
98:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001).md). II. The joy of the redeemed
([Psa 98:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#004).md). If we in a right manner
give to Christ this glory, and upon right grounds take to ourselves this
joy, in singing this psalm, we sing it with understanding. If those who
saw Christ's triumph thus, much more reason have we to do so who see
these things accomplished and share in the better things provided for
us, [Heb 11:40](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#040.md).

A psalm.

[Psalms 98:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 98:1</span></span>

We are here called upon again to sing unto the Lord a new song, as
before, [Psa 96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md). "Sing a most
excellent song, the best song you have." Let the song of Christ's love
be like Solomon's on that subject, a song of songs. A song of praise for
redeeming love is a new song, such a song as had not been sung before;
for this is a mystery which was hidden from ages and generations.
Converts sing a new song, very different from what they had sung; they
change their wonder and change their joy, and therefore change their
note. If the grace of God put a new heart into our breasts, it will
therewith put a new song into our mouths. In the new Jerusalem there
will be new songs sung, that will be new to eternity, and never wax old.
Let this new song be sung to the praise of God, in consideration of
these four things: -

I. The wonders he has wrought: He has done marvellous things, [Psa
98:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001.md). Note, The work of our salvation
by Christ is a work of wonder. If we take a view of all the steps of it
from the contrivance of it, and the counsels of God concerning it before
all time, to the consummation of it, and its everlasting consequences
when time shall be no more, we shall say, God has in it done marvellous
things; it is all his doing and it is marvellous in our eyes. The more
it is known the more it will be admired.

II\. The conquests he has won: His right hand and his holy arm have
gotten him the victory. Our Redeemer has surmounted all the difficulties
that lay in the way of our redemption, has broken through them all, and
was not discouraged by the services or sufferings appointed him. He has
subdued all the enemies that opposed it, has gotten the victory over
Satan, disarmed him, and cast him out of his strong-holds, has spoiled
principalities and powers ([Col 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015).md),
has taken the prey from the mighty ([Isa
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#024).md), and given death his death's
wound. He has gotten a clear and complete victory, not only for himself,
but for us also, for we through him are more than conquerors. He got
this victory by his own power; there was none to help, none to uphold,
none that durst venture into the service; but his right hand and his
holy arm, which are always stretched out with good success, because they
are never stretched out but in a good cause, these have gotten him the
victory, have brought him relief or deliverance. God's power and
faithfulness, called here his right hand and his holy arm, brought
relief to the Lord Jesus, in raising him from the dead, and exalting him
personally to the right hand of God; so Dr. Hammond.

III\. The discoveries he has made to the world of the work of
redemption. What he has wrought for us he has revealed to us, and both
by his Son; the gospel-revelation is that on which the gospel-kingdom is
founded - the word which God sent, [Act
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#036.md). The opening of the sealed book
is that which is to be celebrated with songs of praise ([Rev
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008).md), because by it was brought to
light the mystery which had long been hid in God. Observe, 1. The
subject of this discovery - his salvation and his righteousness, [Psa
98:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#003.md). Righteousness and salvation are
often put together; as [Isa 61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010.md);
[Isa 46:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#013.md); [Isa
51:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#005.md), [Isa
51:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#006.md), [Isa
51:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#008.md). Salvation denotes the redemption
itself, and righteousness the way in which it was wrought, by the
righteousness of Christ. Or the salvation includes all our
gospel-privileges and the righteousness all our gospel-duties; both are
made known, for God has joined them together, and we must not separate
them. Or righteousness is here put for the way of our justification by
Christ, which is revealed in the gospel to be by faith, [Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md). 2. The plainness of this
discovery. He has openly shown it, not in types and figures as under the
law, but it is written as with a sunbeam, that he that runs may read it.
Ministers are appointed to preach it with all plainness of speech. 3.
The extent of this discovery. It is made in the sight of the heathen,
and not of the Jews only: All the ends of the earth have seen the
salvation of our God; for to the Gentiles was the word of salvation
sent.

IV\. The accomplishment of the prophecies and promises of the Old
Testament, in this ([Psa 98:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#003).md): He has
remembered his mercy and his truth towards the house of Israel. God had
mercy in store for the seed of Abraham, and had given them many and
great assurances of the kindness he designed them in the latter days;
and it was in pursuance of all those that he raised up his Son Jesus to
be not only a light to lighten the Gentiles, but the glory of his people
Israel; for he sent him, in the first place, to bless them. God is said,
in sending Christ, to perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to
remember the holy covenant, [Luk 1:72](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#072.md).
It was in consideration of that, and not of their merit.

[Psalms 98:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 98:4</span></span>

The setting up of the kingdom of Christ is here represented as a matter
of joy and praise.

I. Let all the children of men rejoice in it, for they all have, or may
have, benefit by it. Again and again we are here called upon by all ways
and means possible to express our joy in it and give God praise for it:
Make a joyful noise, as before, [Psa
95:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001.md), [Psa
95:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#002.md). Make a loud noise, as those that
are affected with those glad tidings and are desirous to affect others
with them. Rejoice and sing praise, sing Hosannas ([Mat
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009).md), sing Hallelujahs, [Rev
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#006.md). Let him be welcomed to the
throne, as new kings are, with acclamations of joy and loud shouts, till
the earth ring again, as when Solomon was proclaimed, [Kg1
1:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#040.md). And let the shouts of the crowd
be accompanied with the singers and players on instruments ([Psa
87:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#007.md); [Psa
68:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#025).md), as is usual in such
solemnities. 1. Let sacred songs attend the new King: "Sing praise, sing
with the voice of a psalm. Express your joy; thus proclaim it, thus
excite it yet more, and thus propagate it among others." 2. Let these be
assisted with sacred music, not only with the soft and gentle melody of
the harp, but since it is a victorious King whose glory is to be
celebrated, who goes forth conquering and to conquer, let him be
proclaimed with the martial sound of the trumpet and cornet, [Psa
98:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#006.md). Let all this joy be directed to
God, and expressed in a solemn religious manner: Make a joyful noise to
the Lord, [Psa 98:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#004.md). Sing to the Lord,
([Psa 98:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#005).md); do it before the Lord,
the King, [Psa 98:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#006.md). Carnal mirth is
an enemy to this holy joy. When David danced before the ark he pleaded
that it was before the Lord; and the piety and devotion of the intention
not only vindicated what he did, but commended it. We must rejoice
before the Lord whenever we draw near to him ([Deu
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#012).md), before the Lord Jesus, and
before him, not only as the Saviour, but as the King, the King of kings,
the church's King, and our King.

II\. Let the inferior creatures rejoice in it, [Psa
98:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#007.md). This is to the same purport
with what we had before ([Psa
96:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011).md): Let the sea roar, and let
that be called, not as it used to be, a dreadful noise, but a joyful
noise; for the coming of Christ, and the salvation wrought out by him,
have quite altered the property of the troubles and terrors of this
world, so that when the floods lift up their voice, lift up their waves,
we must not construe that to be the sea roaring against us, but rather
rejoicing with us. Let the floods express their joy, as men do when they
clap their hands; and let the hills, that trembled for fear before God
when he came down to give the law at Mount Sinai, dance for joy before
him when his gospel is preached and that word of the Lord goes forth
from Zion in a still small voice: Let the hills be joyful together
before the Lord. This intimates that the kingdom of Christ would be a
blessing to the whole creation; but that, as the inferior creatures
declare the glory of the Creator ([Psa
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001).md), so they declare the glory of
the Redeemer, for by him all things not only subsist in their being, but
consist in their order. It intimates likewise that the children of men
would be wanting in paying their due respects to the Redeemer, and
therefore that he must look for his honour from the sea and the floods,
which would shame the stupidity and ingratitude of mankind. And perhaps
respect is here had to the new heavens and the new earth, which we yet,
according to his promise, look for ([Pe2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013).md), and this second mention of his
coming (after the like, [Psa 96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001).md)
may principally refer to his second coming, when all these things shall
be so dissolved as to be refined; then shall he come to judge the world
with righteousness. In the prospect of that day all that are sanctified
do rejoice, and even the sea, and the floods, and the hills, would
rejoice if they could. One would think that Virgil had these psalms in
his eye, as well as the oracles of the Cumean Sibyl, in his fourth
eclogue, where he either ignorantly or basely applies to Asinius Pollio
the ancient prophecies, which at that time were expected to be
fulfilled; for he lived in the reign of Augustus Caesar, a little before
our Saviour's birth. He owns they looked for the birth of a child from
heaven that should be a great blessing to the world, and restore the
golden age: -

Jam nova progenies coelo demittitur alto -

A new race descends from the lofty sky;

and that should take away sin: -

Te duce, si qua manent sceleris vestigia nostri,

Irrita perpetua solvent formidine terras -

Thy influence shall efface every stain of corruption,

And free the world from alarm.

Many other things he says of this long-looked-for child, which Ludovicus
Vives, in his notes on that eclogue, thinks applicable to Christ; and he
concludes, as the psalmist here, with a prospect of the rejoicing of the
whole creation herein: -

Aspice, venturo laetentur ut omnia saeclo -

See how this promis'd age makes all rejoice.

And, if all rejoice, why should not we?
