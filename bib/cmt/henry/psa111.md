### [Psalms Chapter 111](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 111:0</span></span>

This and divers of the psalms that follow it seem to have been penned by
David for the service of the church in their solemn feasts, and not upon
any particular occasion. This is a psalm of praise. The title of it is
"Hallelujah - Praise you the Lord," intimating that we must address
ourselves to the use of this psalm with hearts disposed to praise God.
It is composed alphabetically, each sentence beginning with a several
letter of the Hebrew alphabet, in order exactly, two sentences to each
verse, and three a piece to the last two. The psalmist, exhorting to
praise God, I. Sets himself for an example ([Psa
111:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001).md). II. Furnishes us with matter
for praise from the works of God. 1. The greatness of his works and the
glory of them. 2. The righteousness of them. 3. The goodness of them. 4.
The power of them. 5. The conformity of them to his word of promise. 6.
The perpetuity of them. These observations are intermixed ([Psa
111:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#002).md). III. He recommends the holy
fear of God, and conscientious obedience to his commands, as the most
acceptable way of praising God ([Psa
111:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010).md).

[Psalms 111:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 111:1</span></span>

The title of the psalm being Hallelujah, the psalmist (as every author
ought to have) has an eye to his title, and keeps to his text.

I. He resolves to praise God himself, [Psa
111:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001.md). What duty we call others to we
must oblige and excite ourselves to; nay, whatever others do, whether
they will praise God or no, we and our houses must determine to do it,
we and our hearts; for such is the psalmist's resolution here: I will
praise the Lord with my whole heart. My heart, my whole heart, being
devoted to his honour, shall be employed in this work; and this in the
assembly, or secret, of the upright, in the cabinet-council, and in the
congregation of Israelites. Note, We must praise God both in private and
in public, in less and greater assemblies, in our own families and in
the courts of the Lord's house; but in both it is most comfortable to do
it in concert with the upright, who will heartily join in it. Private
meetings for devotion should be kept up as well as more public and
promiscuous assemblies.

II\. He recommends to us the works of the Lord as the proper subject of
our meditations when we are praising him - the dispensations of his
providence towards the world, towards the church, and towards particular
persons. 1. God's works are very magnificent, great like himself; there
is nothing in them that is mean or trifling: they are the products of
infinite wisdom and power, and we must say this upon the first view of
them, before we come to enquire more particularly into them, that the
works of the Lord are great, [Psa
111:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#002.md). There is something in them
surprising, and that strikes an awe upon us. All the works of the Lord
are spoken of as one ([Psa 111:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#003).md); it
is his work, such is the beauty and harmony of Providence and so
admirably do all its dispensations centre in one design; it was cried to
the wheels, O wheel! [Eze 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#013.md). Take
all together, and it is honourable and glorious, and such as becomes
him. 2. They are entertaining and exercising to the inquisitive - sought
out of all those that have pleasure therein. Note, (1.) All that truly
love God have pleasure in his works, and reckon all well that he does;
nor do their thoughts dwell upon any subject with more delight than on
the works of God, which the more they are looked into the more they give
us of a pleasing surprise. (2.) Those that have pleasure in the works of
God will not take up with a superficial transient view of them, but will
diligently search into them and observe them. In studying both natural
and political history we should have this in our eye, to discover the
greatness and glory of God's works. (3.) These works of God, that are
humbly and diligently sought into, shall be sought out; those that seek
shall find (so some read); they are found of all those that have
pleasure in them, or found in all their parts, designs, purposes, and
several concernments (so Dr. Hammond), for the secret of the Lord is
with those that fear him, [Psa 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#014.md).
3. They are all justly and holy; His righteousness endures for ever.
Whatever he does, he never did, nor ever will do, any wrong to any of
his creatures; and therefore his works endure for ever ([Ecc
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#014).md) because the righteousness of
them endures. 4. They are admirable and memorable, fit to be registered
and kept on record. Much that we do is so trifling that it is not fit to
be spoken of or told again; the greatest kindness is to forget it. But
notice is to be taken of God's works, and an account to be kept of them
([Psa 111:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#004).md). He has made his
wonderful works to be remembered; he has done that which is worthy to be
remembered, which cannot but be remembered, and he has instituted ways
and means for the keeping of some of them in remembrance, as the
deliverance of Israel out of Egypt by the passover. He has made himself
a memorial by his wonderful works (so some read it); see [Isa
63:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#010.md). By that which God did with his
glorious arm he made himself an everlasting name. 5. They are very kind.
In them the Lord shows that he is gracious and full of compassion. As of
the works of creation, so of the works of providence, we must say, They
are not only all very great, but all very good. Dr. Hammond takes this
to be the name which God has made to himself by his wonderful works, the
same with that which he proclaimed to Moses, The Lord God is gracious
and merciful, [Exo 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#006.md). God's
pardoning sin is the most wonderful of all his works and which ought to
be remembered to his glory. It is a further instance of his grace and
compassion that he has given meat to those that fear him, [Psa
111:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#005.md). He gives them their daily
bread, food convenient for them; so he does to others by common
providence, but to those that fear him he gives it by covenant and in
pursuance of the promise, for it follows, He will be ever mindful of his
covenant; so that they can taste covenant-love even in common mercies.
Some refer this to the manna with which God fed his people Israel in the
wilderness, others to the spoil they got from the Egyptians when they
came out with great substance, according to the promise, [Gen
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#014.md). When God broke the heads of
leviathan he gave him to be meat to his people, [Psa
74:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#014.md). He has given prey to those that
fear him (so the margin has it), not only fed them, but enriched them,
and given their enemies to be a prey to them. 6. They are earnests of
what he will do, according to his promise: He will ever be mindful of
his covenant, for he has ever been so; and, as he never did, so he never
will, let one jot or tittle of it fall to the ground. Though God's
people have their infirmities, and are often unmindful of his commands,
yet he will ever be mindful of his covenant.

[Psalms 111:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 111:6</span></span>

We are here taught to give glory to God,

I. For the great things he has done for his people, for his people
Israel, of old and of late: He has shown his people the power of his
works ([Psa 111:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#006).md), in what he has
wrought for them; many a time he has given proofs of his omnipotence,
and shown them what he can do, and that there is nothing too hard for
him to do. Two things are specified to show the power of his works: - 1.
The possession God gave to Israel in the land of Canaan, that he might
give them, or in giving them, the heritage of the heathen. This he did
in Joshua's time, when the seven nations were subdued, and in David's
time, when the neighbouring nations were many of them brought into
subjection to Israel and became tributaries to David. Herein God showed
his sovereignty, in disposing of kingdoms as he pleases, and his might,
in making good his disposals. If God will make the heritage of the
heathen to be the heritage of Israel, who can either arraign his counsel
or stay his hand? 2. The many deliverances which he wrought for his
people when by their iniquities they had sold themselves into the hand
of their enemies ([Psa 111:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#009).md): He sent
redemption unto his people, not only out of Egypt at first, but often
afterwards; and these redemptions were typical of the great redemption
which in the fulness of time was to be wrought out by the Lord Jesus,
that redemption in Jerusalem which so many waited for.

II\. For the stability both of his word and of his works, which assure
us of the great things he will do for them. 1. What God has done shall
never be undone. He will not undo it himself, and men and devils cannot
([Psa 111:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#007).md): The works of his hand
are verity and judgment ([Psa 111:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#008).md),
that is, they are done in truth and uprightness; all he does is
consonant to the eternal rules and reasons of equity, all according to
the counsel of his wisdom and the purpose of his will, all well done and
therefore there is nothing to be altered or amended, but his works are
firm and unchangeable. Upon the beginning of his works we may depend for
the perfecting of them; work that is done properly will last, will
neither go to decay nor sink under the stress that is laid upon it. 2.
What God has said shall never be unsaid: All his commandments are sure,
all straight and therefore all steady. His purposes, the rule of his
actions, shall all have their accomplishment: Has he spoken, and will he
not make it good? No doubt he will; whether he commands light or
darkness, it is done as he commands. His precepts, the rule of our
actions, are unquestionably just and good, and therefore unchangeable
and not to be repealed; his promises and threatenings are all sure, and
will be made good; nor shall the unbelief of man make either the one or
the other of no effect. They are established, and therefore they stand
fast for ever and ever, and the scripture cannot be broken. The wise God
is never put upon new counsels, nor obliged to take new measures, either
in his laws or in his providences. All is said, as all is done, in truth
and uprightness, and therefore it is immutable. Men's folly and
falsehood make them unstable in all their ways, but infinite wisdom and
truth for ever exclude retraction and revocation: He has commanded his
covenant for ever. God's covenant is commanded, for he has made it as
one that has an incontestable authority to prescribe both what we must
do and what we must expect, and an unquestionable ability to perform
both what he has promised in the blessings of the covenant and what he
has threatened in the curses of it, [Psa
105:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#008.md).

III\. For the setting up and establishing of religion among men. Because
holy and reverend is his name, and the fear of him is the beginning of
wisdom, therefore his praise endureth for ever, that is, he is to be
everlastingly praised. 1. Because the discoveries of religion tend so
much to his honour. Review what he has made known of himself in his word
and in his works, and you will see, and say, that God is great and
greatly to be feared; for his name is holy, his infinite purity and
rectitude appear in all that whereby he has made himself known, and
because it is holy therefore it is reverend, and to be thought of and
mentioned with a holy awe. Note, What is holy is reverend; the angels
have an eye to God's holiness when they cover their faces before him,
and nothing is more man's honour than his sanctification. It is in his
holy places that God appears most terrible, [Psa
68:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#035.md); [Lev
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003.md). 2. Because the dictates of
religion tend so much to man's happiness. We have reason to praise God
that the matter is so well contrived that our reverence of him and
obedience to him are as much our interest as they are our duty. (1.) Our
reverence of him is so: The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
It is not only reasonable that we should fear God, because his name is
reverend and his nature is holy, but it is advantageous to us. It is
wisdom; it will direct us to speak and act as becomes us, in a
consistency with ourselves, and for our own benefit. It is the head of
wisdom, that is (as we read it), it is the beginning of wisdom. Men can
never begin to be wise till they begin to fear God; all true wisdom
takes its rise from true religion, and has its foundation in it. Or, as
some understand it, it is the chief wisdom, and the most excellent, the
first in dignity. It is the principal wisdom, and the principal of
wisdom, to worship God and give honour to him as our Father and Master.
Those manage well who always act under the government of his holy fear.
(2.) Our obedience to him is so: A good understanding have all those
that do his commandments. Where the fear of the Lord rules in the heart
there will be a constant conscientious care to keep his commandments,
not to talk of them, but to do them; and such have a good understanding,
that is, \[1.\] They are well understood; their obedience is graciously
accepted as a plain indication of their mind that they do indeed fear
God. Compare [Pro 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#004.md), So shalt thou
find favour and good understanding. God and man will look upon those as
meaning well, and approve of them, who make conscience of their duty,
though they have their mistakes. What is honestly intended shall be well
taken. \[2.\] They understand well. First, It is a sign that they do
understand well. The most obedient are accepted as the most intelligent;
those understand themselves and their interest best that make God's law
their rule and are in every thing ruled by it. A great understanding
those have that know God's commandments and can discourse learnedly of
them, but a good understanding have those that do them and walk
according to them. Secondly, It is the way to understand better: A good
understanding are they to all that do them; the fear of the Lord and the
laws of that give men a good understanding, and are able to make them
wise unto salvation. If any man will do his will, he shall know more and
more clearly of the doctrine of Christ, [Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017.md). Good success have all those that
do them (so the margin), according to what was promised to Joshua if he
would observe to do according to the law. [Jos
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#008.md), Then thou shalt make thy way
prosperous and shalt have good success. We have reason to praise God, to
praise him for ever, for putting man into such a fair way to happiness.
Some apply the last words rather to the good man who fears the Lord than
to the good God: His praise endures for ever. It is not of men perhaps,
but it is of God ([Rom 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029).md), and that
praise which is of God endures for ever when the praise of men is
withered and gone.
