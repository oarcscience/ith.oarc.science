### [Matthew Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#001.md)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 27:0</span></span>

It is a very affecting story which is recorded in this chapter
concerning the sufferings and death of our Lord Jesus. Considering the
thing itself, there cannot be a more tragical story told us; common
humanity would melt the heart, to find an innocent and excellent person
thus misused. But considering the design and fruit of Christ's
sufferings, it is gospel, it is good news, that Jesus Christ was thus
delivered for our offences; and there is nothing we have more reason to
glory in than the cross of Christ. In this chapter, observe, I. How he
was prosecuted. 1. The delivering of him to Pilate ([Mat
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#001.md), [Mat
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#002).md). 2. The despair of Judas ([Mat
27:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#003).md). 3. The arraignment and trial
of Christ before Pilate ([Mat
27:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#011).md). 4. The clamours of the
people against him ([Mat 27:15-25](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#015).md). 5.
Sentence passed, and the warrant signed for his execution ([Mat
27:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#026).md). II. How he was executed. 1. He
was barbarously used ([Mat 27:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#027).md).
2. Led to the place of execution ([Mat
27:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#031).md). 3. There he had all
possible indignities done him, and reproaches cast upon him ([Mat
27:34-44](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#034).md). 4. Heaven frowned upon him
([Mat 27:45-49](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#045).md). 5. Many remarkable
things attended his death ([Mat
27:50-56](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#050).md). He was buried and a watch
set on his grave ([Mat 27:57-66](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#057).md).

[Matthew 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 27:1</span></span>

We left Christ in the hands of the chief priests and elders, condemned
to die, but they could only show their teeth; about two years before
this the Romans had taken from the Jews the power of capital punishment;
they could put no man to death, and therefore early in the morning
another council is held, to consider what is to be done. And here we are
told what was done in that morning-council, after they had been for two
or three hours consulting with their pillows.

I. Christ is delivered up to Pilate, that he might execute the sentence
they had passed upon him. Judea having been almost one hundred years
before this conquered by Pompey, had ever since been tributary to Rome,
and was lately made part of the province of Syria, and subject to the
government of the president of Syria, under whom there were several
procurators, who chiefly attended the business of the revenues, but
sometimes, as Pilate particularly, had the whole power of the president
lodged in them. This was a plain evidence that the sceptre was departed
from Judah, and that therefore now the Shilloh must come, according to
Jacob's prophecy, [Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md). Pilate
is characterized by the Roman writers of that time, as a man of a rough
and haughty spirit, wilful and implacable, and extremely covetous and
oppressive; the Jews had a great enmity to his person, and were weary of
his government, and yet they made use of him as the tool of their malice
against Christ.

1\. They bound Jesus. He was bound when he was first seized; but either
they took off these bonds when he was before the council, or now they
added to them. Having found him guilty, they tied his hands behind him,
as they usually do with convicted criminals. He was already bound with
the bonds of love to man, and of his own undertaking, else he had soon
broken these bonds, as Samson did his. We were fettered with the bond of
iniquity, held in the cords of our sins ([Pro
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#022).md); but God had bound the yoke of
our transgressions upon the neck of the Lord Jesus (Lam. 50:14), that we
might be loosed by his bonds, as we are healed by his stripes.

2\. They led him away in a sort of triumph, led him as a lamb to the
slaughter; so was he taken from prison and from judgment, [Isa
53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007.md), [Isa
53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md). It was nearly a mile from
Caiaphas's house to Pilate's. All that way they led him through the
streets of Jerusalem, when in the morning they began to fill, to make
him a spectacle to the world.

3\. They delivered him to Pontius Pilate; according to that which Christ
had often said, that he should be delivered to the Gentiles. Both Jews
and Gentiles were obnoxious to the judgment of God, and concluded under
sin, and Christ was to be the Saviour both of Jews and Gentiles; and
therefore Christ was brought into the judgment both of Jews and
Gentiles, and both had a hand in his death. See how these corrupt
church-rulers abused the civil magistrate, making use of him to execute
their unrighteous decrees, and inflict the grievance which they had
prescribed, [Isa 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#001.md). Thus have the
kings of the earth been wretchedly imposed upon by the papal powers, and
condemned to the drudgery of extirpating with the sword of war, as well
as that of justice, those whom they have marked for heretics, right or
wrong, to the great prejudice of their own interests.

II\. The money which they had paid to Judas for betraying Christ, is by
him delivered back to them, and Judas, in despair, hangs himself. The
chief priests and elders supported themselves with this, in prosecuting
Christ, that his own disciple betrayed him to them; but now, in the
midst of the prosecution, that string failed them, and even he is made
to them a witness of Christ's innocency and a monument of God's justice;
which served, 1. For glory to Christ in the midst of his sufferings, and
a specimen of his victory over Satan who had entered into Judas. 2. For
warning to his persecutors, and to leave them the more inexcusable. If
their heart had not been fully set in them to do this evil, what Judas
said and did, one would think, should have stopped the prosecution.

(1.) See here how Judas repented: not like Peter, who repented,
believed, and was pardoned: no, he repented, despaired, and was ruined.
Now observe here,

\[1.\] What induced him to repent. It was when he saw that he was
condemned. Judas, it is probable, expected that either Christ would have
made his escape out of their hands, or would so have pleaded his own
cause at their bar as to have come off, and then Christ would have had
the honour, the Jews the shame, and he the money, and no harm done. This
he had no reason to expect, because he had so often heard his Master say
that he must be crucified; yet it is probable that he did expect it, and
when the event did not answer his vain fancy, then he fell into this
horror, when he saw the stream strong against Christ, and him yielding
to it. Note, Those who measure actions by the consequences of them
rather than by the divine law, will find themselves mistaken in their
measures. The way of sin is down-hill; and if we cannot easily stop
ourselves, much less can we stop others whom we have set a going in a
sinful way. He repented himself; that is, he was filled with grief,
anguish, and indignation, at himself, when reflecting upon what he had
done. When he was tempted to betray his Master, the thirty pieces of
silver looked very fine and glittering, like the wine, when it is red,
and gives its colour in the cup. But when the thing was done, and the
money paid, the silver was become dross, it bit like a serpent, and
stung like an adder. Now his conscience flew in his face; "What have I
done! What a fool, what a wretch, am I, to sell my Master, and all my
comfort and happiness in him, for such a trifle! All these abuses and
indignities done him are chargeable upon me; it is owing to me, that he
is bound and condemned, spit upon and buffeted. I little thought it
would have come to this, when I made that wicked bargain; so foolish was
I, and ignorant, and so like a beast." Now he curses the bag he carried,
the money he coveted, the priests he dealt with, and the day that he was
born. The remembrance of his Master's goodness to him, which he had so
basely requited, the bowels of mercy he had spurned at, and the fair
warnings he had slighted, steeled his convictions, and made them the
more piercing. Now he found his Master's words true; It were better for
that man, that he had never been born. Note, Sin will soon change its
taste. Though it be rolled under the tongue as a sweet morsel, in the
bowels it will be turned into the gall of asps ([Job
20:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#012).md), like John's book, [Rev
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#009.md).

\[2.\] What were the indications of his repentance.

First, He made restitution; He brought again the thirty pieces of silver
to the chief priests, when they were all together publicly. Now the
money burned in his conscience, and he was as sick of it as ever he had
been fond of it. Note, That which is ill gotten, will never do good to
those that get it, [Jer 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#010.md); [Job
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#015.md). If he had repented, and brought
the money back before he had betrayed Christ, he might have done it with
comfort, then he had agreed while yet in the way; but now it was too
late, now he cannot do it without horror, wishing ten thousand times he
had never meddled with it. See [Jam
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#003.md). He brought it again. Note, what
is unjustly gotten, must not be kept; for that is a continuance in the
sin by which it was got, and such an avowing of it as is not consistent
with repentance. He brought it to those from whom he had it, to let them
know that he repented his bargain. Note, Those who have served and
hardened others in their sin, when God gives them repentance, should let
them know it whose sins they have been partakers in, that it may be a
means to bring them to repentance.

Secondly, He made confession ([Mat
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#004).md); I have sinned, in that I have
betrayed innocent blood. 1. To the honour of Christ, he pronounces his
blood innocent. If he had been guilty of any sinful practices, Judas, as
his disciple, would certainly have know it, and, as his betrayer, would
certainly have discovered it; but he, freely and without being urged to
it, pronounces him innocent, to the face of those who had pronounced him
guilty. 2. To his own shame, he confesses that he had sinned, in
betraying this blood. He does not lay the blame on any one else; does
not say, "You have sinned, in hiring me to do it;" but takes it all to
himself; "I have sinned, in doing it." Thus far Judas went toward his
repentance, yet it was not to salvation. He confessed, but not to God,
did not go to him, and say, I have sinned, Father, against heaven. He
confessed the betraying of innocent blood, but did not confess that
wicked love of money, which was the root of this evil. There are those
who betray Christ, and yet justify themselves in it, and so come short
of Judas.

(2.) See here how the chief priests and elders entertained Judas's
penitential confession; they said, What is that to us? See thou to that.
He made them his confessors, and that was the absolution they gave him;
more like the priests of devils than like the priests of the holy living
God.

\[1.\] See here how carelessly they speak of the betraying of Christ.
Judas had told them that the blood of Christ was innocent blood; and
they said, What is that to us? Was it nothing to them that they had
thirsted after this blood, and hired Judas to betray it, and had now
condemned it to be shed unjustly? Is this nothing to them? Does it give
no check to the violence of their prosecution, no warning to take need
what they do to this just man? Thus do fools make a mock at sin, as if
no harm were done, no hazard run, by the commission of the greatest
wickedness. Thus light do many make of Christ crucified; what is it to
them, that he suffered such things?

\[2.\] See here how carelessly they speak of the sin of Judas; he said,
I have sinned, and they said, "What is that to us? What are we concerned
in thy sin, that thou tellest us of it?" Note, It is folly for us to
think that the sins of others are nothing to us, especially those sins
that we are any way accessary to, or partakers in. Is it nothing to us,
that God is dishonoured, souls wounded, Satan gratified and his
interests served, and that we have aided and abetted it? If the elders
of Jezreel, to please Jezebel, murder Naboth, is that nothing to Ahab?
Yes, he has killed, for he has taken possession, [Kg1
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#019.md). The guilt of sin is not so
easily transferred as some people think it is. If there were guilt in
the matter, they tell Judas that he must look to it, he must bear it.
First, Because he had betrayed him to them. His was indeed the greater
sin ([Joh 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#011).md); but it did not
therefore follow, that theirs was no sin. It is a common instance of the
deceitfulness of our hearts, to extenuate our own sin by the aggravation
of other people's sins. But the judgment of God is according to truth,
not according to comparison. Secondly, Because he knew and believed him
to be innocent. "If he be innocent, see thou to it, that is more than we
know; we have adjudged him guilty, and therefore may justly prosecute
him as such," Wicked practices are buoyed up by wicked principles, and
particularly by this, That sin is sin only to those that think it to be
so; that it is no harm to persecute a good man, if we take him to be a
bad man; but those who thus think to mock God, will but deceive and
destroy themselves.

\[3.\] See how carelessly they speak of the conviction, terror, and
remorse, that Judas was under. They were glad to make use of him in the
sin, and were then very fond of him; none more welcome to them than
Judas, when he said, What will ye give me, and I will betray him to you?
They did not say, What is that to us? But now that his sin had put him
into a fright, now they slighted him, had nothing to say to him, but
turned him over to his own terrors; why did he come to trouble them with
his melancholy fancies? They had something else to do than to heed him.
But why so shy? First, Perhaps they were in some fear lest the sparks of
his conviction, brought too near, should kindle a fire in their own
consciences, and lest his moans, listened to, should give an alarm to
their own convictions. Note, Obstinate sinners stand upon their guard
against convictions; and those that are resolvedly impenitent, look with
disdain upon the penitent. Secondly, However, they were in no concern to
succour Judas; when they had brought him into the snare, they not only
left him, but laughed at him. Note, Sinners, under convictions, will
find their old companions in sin but miserable comforters. It is usual
for those that love the treason, to hate the traitor.

(3.) Here is the utter despair that Judas was hereby driven into. If the
chief priests had promised him to stay the prosecution, it would have
been some comfort to him; but, seeing no hopes of that, he grew
desperate, [Mat 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#005.md).

\[1.\] He cast down the pieces of silver in the temple. The chief
priests would not take the money, for fear of taking thereby the whole
guilt to themselves, which they were willing that Judas should bear the
load of; Judas would not keep it, it was too hot for him to hold, he
therefore threw it down in the temple, that, whether they would or no,
it might fall into the hands of the chief priests. See what a drug money
was, when the guilt of sin was tacked to it, or was thought to be so.

\[2.\] He went, and hanged himself. First, He retired - anechōrēse; he
withdrew into some solitary place, like the possessed man that was drawn
by the devil into the wilderness, [Luk
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#029.md). Woe to him that is in despair,
and is alone. If Judas had gone to Christ, or to some of the disciples,
perhaps he might have had relief, bad as the case was; but, missing of
it with the chief priests, he abandoned himself to despair: and the same
devil that with the help of the priests drew him to the sin, with their
help drove him to despair. Secondly, He became his own executioner; He
hanged himself; he was suffocated with grief, so Dr. Hammond: but Dr.
Whitby is clear that our translation is right. Judas had a sight and
sense of sin, but no apprehension of the mercy of God in Christ, and so
he pined away in his iniquity. His sin, we may suppose, was not in its
own nature unpardonable: there were some of those saved, that had been
Christ's betrayers and murderers; but he concluded, as Cain, that his
iniquity was greater than could be forgiven, and would rather throw
himself on the devil's mercy than God's. And some have said, that Judas
sinned more in despairing of the mercy of God, than in betraying his
Master's blood. Now the terrors of the Almighty set themselves in array
against him. All the curses written in God's book now came into his
bowels like water, and like oil into his bones, as was foretold
concerning him ([Psa 109:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#018.md), [Psa
109:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#019).md), and drove him to this
desperate shift, for the escaping of a hell within him, to leap into
that before him, which was but the perfection and perpetuity of this
horror and despair. He throws himself into the fire, to avoid the flame;
but miserable is the case when a man must go to hell for ease.

Now, in this story, 1. We have an instance of the wretched end of those
into whom Satan enters, and particularly those that are given up to the
love of money. This is the destruction in which many are drowned by it,
[Ti1 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009.md), [Ti1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010.md). Remember what became of the
swine into which, and of the traitor into whom, the devil enters; and
give not place to the devil. 2. We have an instance of the wrath of God
revealed from heaven against the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men,
[Rom 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018.md). As in the story of Peter we
behold the goodness of God, and the triumphs of Christ's grace in the
conversion of some sinners; so in the story of Judas we behold the
severity of God, and the triumphs of Christ's power and justice in the
confusion of other sinners. When Judas, into whom Satan entered, was
thus hung up, Christ made an open show of the principalities and powers
he undertook the spoiling of, [Col
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015.md). 3. We have an instance of the
direful effects of despair; it often ends in self-murder. Sorrow, even
that for sin, if not according to God, worketh death ([Co2
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010).md), the worst kind of death; for a
wounded spirit, who can bear? Let us think as bad as we can of sin,
provided we do not think it unpardonable; let us despair of help in
ourselves, but not of help in God. He that thinks to ease his conscience
by destroying his life, doth, in effect, dare God Almighty to do his
worst. And self-murder, though prescribed by some of the heathen
moralists, is certainly a remedy worse than the disease, how bad soever
the disease may be. Let us watch against the beginnings of melancholy,
and pray, Lord, lead us not into temptation.

(4.) The disposal of the money which Judas brought back, [Mat
27:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#006.md). It was laid out in the
purchase of a field, called the potter's field; because some potter had
owned it, or occupied it, or lived near it, or because broken potters'
vessels were thrown into it. And this field was to be a burying-place
for strangers, that is, proselytes to the Jewish religion, who were of
other nations, and, coming to Jerusalem to worship, happened to die
there. \[1.\] It looks like an instance of their humanity, that they
took care for the burying of strangers; and it intimates that they
themselves allowed (as St. Paul saith, [Act
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#015).md), that there shall be a
resurrection of the dead, both of the just and of the unjust; for we
therefore take care of the dead body, not only because it has been the
habitation of a rational soul, but because it must be so again. But,
\[2.\] It was no instance of their humility that they would bury
strangers in a place by themselves, as if they were not worthy to be
laid in their burying-places; strangers must keep their distance, alive
and dead, and that principle must go down to the grace, Stand by
thyself, come not near me, I am holier than thou, [Isa
65:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#005.md). The sons of Seth were better
affected towards Abraham, though a stranger among them, when they
offered him the choicest of their own sepulchres, [Gen
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#006.md). But the sons of the stranger,
that have joined themselves to the Lord, though buried by themselves,
shall rise with all that are dead in Christ.

This buying of the potter's field did not take place on the day that
Christ died (they were then too busy to mind any thing else but hunting
him down); but it took place not long after; for Peter speaks of it soon
after Christ's ascension; yet it is here recorded.

First, To show the hypocrisy of the chief priests and elders. They were
maliciously persecuting the blessed Jesus, and now,

1\. They scruple to put that money into the treasury, or corban, of the
temple, with which they had hired the traitor. Though perhaps they had
taken it out of the treasury, pretending it was for the public good, and
though they were great sticklers for the corban, and laboured to draw
all the wealth of the nation into it, yet they would not put that money
into it, which was the price of blood. The hire of a traitor they
thought parallel to the hire of a whore, and the price of a malefactor
(such a one they made Christ to be) equivalent to the price of a dog,
neither of which was to be brought into the house of the Lord, [Deu
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#018.md). They would thus save their
credit with the people, by possessing them with an opinion of their
great reverence for the temple. Thus they that swallowed a camel,
strained at a gnat.

2\. They think to atone for what they had done, by this public good act
of providing a burying-place for strangers, though not at their own
charge. Thus in times of ignorance people were made to believe that
building churches and endowing monasteries would make amends for
immoralities.

Secondly, To signify the favour intended by the blood of Christ to
strangers, and sinners of the Gentiles. Through the price of his blood,
a resting place is provided for them after death. Thus many of the
ancients apply this passage. The grave is the potter's field, where the
bodies are thrown as despised broken vessels; but Christ by his blood
purchased it for those who by confessing themselves strangers on earth
seek the better country; he has altered the property of it (as a
purchaser doth), so that now death is ours, the grave is ours, a bed of
rest for us. The Germans, in their language, call burying-places God's
fields; for in them God sows his people as a corn of wheat, [Joh
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024.md). See [Hos
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023.md); [Isa
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019.md).

Thirdly, To perpetuate the infamy of those that bought and sold the
blood of Christ. This field was commonly called Aceldama - the field of
blood; not by the chief priests, they hoped in this burying-place to
bury the remembrance of their own crime; but by the people; who took
notice of Judas's acknowledgment that he had betrayed the innocent
blood, though the chief priests made nothing of it. They fastened this
name upon the field in perpetuam rei memoriam - for a perpetual
memorial. Note, Divine Providence has many ways of entailing disgrace
upon the wicked practices even of great men, who, though they seek to
cover their shame, are put to a perpetual reproach.

Fourthly, That we may see how the scripture was fulfilled ([Mat
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#009.md), [Mat
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#010).md); Then was fulfilled that which
was spoken by Jeremy the prophet. The words quoted are found in the
prophecy of Zechariah, [Zac 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#012.md). How
they are here said to be spoken by Jeremy is a difficult question; but
the credit of Christ's doctrine does not depend upon it; for that proves
itself perfectly divine, though there should appear something human as
to small circumstances in the penmen of it. The Syriac version, which is
ancient, reads only, It was spoken by the prophet, not naming any,
whence some have thought that Jeremy was added by some scribe; some
think that the whole volume of the prophets, being in one book, and the
prophecy of Jeremiah put first, it might not be improper, currente
calamo - for a transcriber to quote any passage out of that volume,
under his name. The Jews used to say, The spirit of Jeremiah was in
Zechariah, and so they were as one prophet. Some suggest that it was
spoken by Jeremiah, but written by Zechariah; or that Jeremiah wrote the
ninth, tenth, and eleventh chapters of Zechariah. Now this passage in
the prophet is a representation of the great contempt of God, that was
found among the Jews, and the poor returns they made to him for rich
receivings from him. But here that is really acted, which was there but
figuratively expressed. The sum of money is the same - thirty pieces of
silver; this they weighed for his price, at this rate they valued him; a
goodly price; and this was cast to the potter in the house of the Lord;
which was here literally accomplished. Note, We should better understand
the events of Providence, if we were better acquainted even with the
language and expressions of scripture; for even those also are sometimes
written upon the dispensations of Providence so plainly, that he who
runs may read them. What David spoke figuratively ([Psa
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007).md), Jonah made a literal
application of; All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me, [Jon
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#003.md).

The giving of the price of him that was valued, not for him, but for the
potter's field, bespeaks, 1. The high value that ought to be put upon
Christ. The price was given, not for him; no, when it was given for him,
it was soon brought back again with disdain, as infinitely below his
worth; he cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, nor this unspeakable
Gift brought with money. 2. The low value that was put upon him. They of
the children of Israel did strangely undervalue him, when his price did
but reach to buy a potter's field, a pitiful sorry spot of ground, not
worth looking upon. It added to the reproach of his being bought and
sold, that it was at so low a rate. Cast it to the potter, so it is in
Zechariah; a contemptible petty chapman, not the merchant that deals in
things of value. And observe, They of the children of Israel thus
undervalued him; they who were his own people, that should have known
better what estimate to put upon him, they to whom he was first sent,
whose glory he was, and whom he had valued so highly, and bought so
dear. He gave kings' ransoms for them, and the richest countries (so
precious were they in his sight, [Isa
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003.md), [Isa
43:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#004).md), Egypt, and Ethiopia, and Seba;
but they gave a slave's ransom for him (see [Exo
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#032).md), and valued him but at the rate
of a potter's field; so was that blood trodden under foot, which bought
the kingdom of heaven for us. But all this was as the Lord appointed; so
the prophetic vision was, which typified this event, and so the event
itself, as the other instances of Christ's sufferings, was by the
determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God.

[Matthew 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 27:11</span></span>

We have here an account of what passed in Pilate's judgment-hall, when
the blessed Jesus was brought thither betimes in the morning. Though it
was no court-day, Pilate immediately took his case before him. We have
there,

I. The trial Christ had before Pilate.

1\. His arraignment; Jesus stood before the governor, as the prisoner
before the judge. We could not stand before God because of our sins, nor
lift up our face in his presence, if Christ had not been thus made sin
for us. He was arraigned that we might be discharged. Some think that
this bespeaks his courage and boldness; he stood undaunted, unmoved by
all their rage. He thus stood in this judgment, that we might stand in
God's judgment. He stood for a spectacle, as Naboth, when he was
arraigned, was set on high among the people.

2\. His indictment; Art thou the king of the Jews? The Jews were now not
only under the government, but under the very jealous inspection, of the
Roman powers, which they were themselves to the highest degree
disaffected to, and yet now pretended a concern for, to serve this turn;
accusing Jesus as an Enemy to Caesar ([Luk
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#002).md), which they could produce no
other proof of, than that he himself had newly owned he was the Christ.
Now they thought that whoever was the Christ, must be the king of the
Jews, and must deliver them from the Roman power, and restore to them a
temporal dominion, and enable them to trample upon all their neighbours.
According to this chimera of their own, they accused our Lord Jesus, as
making himself king of the Jews, in opposition to the Roman yoke;
whereas, though he said that he was the Christ, he meant not such a
Christ as this. Note, Many oppose Christ's holy religion, upon a mistake
of the nature of it; they dress it up in false colours, and then fight
against it. They assuring the governor that, if he made himself Christ,
he made himself king of the Jews, the governor takes it for granted,
that he goes about to pervert the nation, and subvert the government.
Art thou a king? It was plain that he was not so de facto - actually;
"But dost thou lay any claim to the government, or pretend a right to
rule the Jews?" Note, It has often been the hard fate of Christ's holy
religion, unjustly to fall under the suspicions of the civil powers, as
if it were hurtful to kings and provinces, whereas it tends mightily to
the benefit of both.

3\. His plea; Jesus said unto him, "Thou sayest. It is as thou sayest,
though not as thou meanest; I am a king, but not such a king as thou
dost suspect me to be." Thus before Pilate he witnessed a good
confession, and was not ashamed to own himself a king, though it looked
ridiculous, nor afraid, though at this time it was dangerous.

4\. The evidence ([Mat 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#012).md); He was
accused of the chief priests. Pilate found no fault in him; whatever was
said, nothing was proved, and therefore what was wanting in matter they
made up in noise and violence, and followed him with repeated
accusations, the same as they had given in before; but by the repetition
they thought to force a belief from the governor. They had learned, not
only calumniari - to calumniate, but fortiter calumniari - to calumniate
stoutly. The best men have often been accused of the worst crimes.

5\. The prisoner's silence as to the prosecutors' accusations; He
answered nothing, (1.) Because there was no occasion; nothing was
alleged but what carried its own confutation along with it. (2.) He was
now taken up with the great concern that lay between him and his Father,
to whom he was offering up himself a Sacrifice, to answer the demands of
his justice, which he was so intent upon, that he minded not what they
said against him. (3.) His hour was come, and he submitted to his
Father's will; Not as I will, but as thou wilt. He knew what his
Father's will was, and therefore silently committed himself to him that
judgeth righteously. We must not thus by our silence throw away our
lives, because we are not lords of our lives, as Christ was of his; nor
can we know, as he did, when our hour is come. But hence we must learn,
not to render railing for railing, [Pe1
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#023.md).

Now, \[1.\] Pilate pressed him to make some reply ([Mat
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#013).md); Hearest thou not how many
things they witness against thee? What these things were, may be
gathered from [Luk 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#003.md), [Luk
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#005.md), and [Joh
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#007.md). Pilate, having no malice at all
against him, was desirous he should clear himself, urges him to it, and
believes he could do it; Hearest thou not? Yes, he did hear; and still
he hears all that is witnessed unjustly against his truths and ways; but
he keeps silence, because it is the day of his patience, and doth not
answer, as he will shortly, [Psa 50:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#003.md).
\[2.\] He wondered at his silence; which was not interpreted so much
into a contempt of the court, as a contempt of himself. And therefore
Pilate is not said to be angry at it, but to have marvelled greatly at
it, as a thing very unusual. He believed him to be innocent, and had
heard perhaps that never man spake like him; and therefore he thought it
strange that he had not one word to say for himself. We have,

II\. The outrage and violence of the people, in pressing the governor to
crucify Christ. The chief priests had a great interest in the people,
they called them Rabbi, Rabbi, made idols of them, and oracles of all
they said; and they made use of this to incense them against him, and by
the power of the mob gained the point which they could not otherwise
carry. Now here are two instances of their outrage.

1\. Their preferring Barabbas before him, and choosing to have him
released rather than Jesus.

(1.) It seems it was grown into a custom with the Roman governors, for
the honouring of the Jews, to grace the feast of the passover with the
release of a prisoner, [Mat 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#015.md).
This, they thought, did honour to the feast, and was agreeable to the
commemoration of their deliverance; but it was an invention of their
own, and no divine institution; though some think that it was ancient,
and kept up by the Jewish princes, before they became a province of the
empire. However, it was a bad custom, an obstruction to justice, and an
encouragement to wickedness. But our gospel-passover is celebrated with
the release of prisoners, by him who hath power on earth to forgive
sins.

(2.) The prisoner put in competition with our Lord Jesus was Barabbas;
he is here called a notable prisoner ([Mat
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#016).md); either because by birth and
breeding he was of some note and quality, or because he had signalized
himself by something remarkable in his crimes; whether he was so notable
as to recommend himself the more to the favours of the people, and so
the more likely to be interceded for, or whether so notable as to make
himself more liable to their age, is uncertain. Some think the latter,
and therefore Pilate mentioned him, as taking it for granted that they
would have desired any one's release rather than his. Treason, murder,
and felony, are the three most enormous crimes that are usually punished
by the sword of justice; and Barabbas was guilty of all three, [Luk
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#019.md); [Joh
18:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#040.md). A notable prisoner indeed,
whose crimes were so complicated.

(3.) The proposal was made by Pilate the governor ([Mat
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#017).md); Whom will ye that I release
unto you? It is probable that the judge had the nomination of two, one
of which the people were to choose. Pilate proposed to them to have
Jesus released; he was convinced of his innocency, and that the
prosecution was malicious; yet had not the courage to acquit him, as he
ought to have done, by his own power, but would have him released by the
people's election, and so he hoped to satisfy both his own conscience,
and the people too; whereas, finding no fault in him, he ought not to
have put him upon the country, or brought him into peril of his life.
But such little tricks and artifices as these, to trim the matter, and
to keep in with conscience and the world too, are the common practice of
those that seek more to please men than God. What shall I do then, saith
Pilate, with Jesus, who is called Christ? He puts the people in mind of
this, that this Jesus, whose release he proposed, was looked upon by
some among them as the Messiah, and had given pregnant proofs of his
being so; "Do not reject one of whom your nation has professed such an
expectation."

The reason why Pilate laboured thus to get Jesus discharged was because
he knew that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up ([Mat
27:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#018).md); that it was not his guilt, but
his goodness, that they were provoked at; and for this reason he hoped
to bring him off by the people's act, and that they would be for his
release. When David was envied by Saul, he was the darling of the
people; and any one that heard the hosannas with which Christ was but a
few days ago brought into Jerusalem, would have thought that he had been
so, and that Pilate might safely have referred this matter to the
commonalty, especially when so notorious a rogue was set up as a rival
with him for their favours. But it proved otherwise.

(4.) While Pilate was thus labouring the matter, he was confirmed in his
unwillingness to condemn Jesus, by a message sent him from his wife
([Mat 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#019).md), by way of caution; Have
thou nothing to do with that just man (together with the reason), for I
have suffered many things this day in a cream because of him. Probably,
this message was delivered to Pilate publicly, in the hearing of all
that were present, for it was intended to be a warning not to him only,
but to the prosecutors. Observe,

\[1.\] The special providence of God, in sending this dream to Pilate's
wife; it is not likely that she had heard any thing, before, concerning
Christ, at least not so as to occasion her dreaming of him, but it was
immediately from God: perhaps she was one of the devout and honourable
women, and had some sense of religion; yet God revealed himself by
dreams to some that had not, as to Nebuchadnezzar. She suffered many
things in this dream; whether she dreamed of the cruel usage of an
innocent person, or of the judgments that would fall upon those that had
any hand in his death, or both, it seems that it was a frightful dream,
and her thoughts troubled her, as [Dan
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#001.md); [Dan
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#005.md). Note, The Father of spirits has
many ways of access to the spirits of men, and can seal their
instruction in a dream, or vision of the night, [Job
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#015.md), [Job
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#016.md). Yet to those who have the
written word, God more ordinarily speaks by conscience on a waking bed,
than by dreams, when deep sleep falls upon men.

\[2.\] The tenderness and care of Pilate's wife, in sending this
caution, thereupon, to her husband; Have nothing to do with that just
man. First, This was an honourable testimony to our Lord Jesus,
witnessing for him that he was a just man, even then when he was
persecuted as the worst of malefactors: when his friends were afraid to
appear in defence of him, God made even those that were strangers and
enemies, to speak in his favour; when Peter denied him, Judas confessed
him; when the chief priests pronounced him guilty of death, Pilate
declared he found no fault in him; when the women that loved him stood
afar off, Pilate's wife, who knew little of him, showed a concern for
him. Note, God will not leave himself without witnesses to the truth and
equity of his cause, even when it seems to be most spitefully run down
by its enemies, and most shamefully deserted by its friends. Secondly,
It was a fair warning to Pilate; Have nothing to do with him. Note, God
has many ways of giving checks to sinners in their sinful pursuits, and
it is a great mercy to have such checks from Providence, from faithful
friends, and from our own consciences; it is also our great duty to
hearken to them. O do not this abominable thing which the Lord hates, is
what we may hear said to us, when we are entering into temptation, if we
will but regard it. Pilate's lady sent him this warning, out of the love
she had to him; she feared not a rebuke from him for meddling with that
which belonged not to her; but, let him take it how he would, she would
give him the caution. Note, It is an instance of true love to our
friends and relations, to do what we can to keep them from sin; and the
nearer any are to us, and the greater affection we have for them, the
more solicitous we should be not to suffer sin to come or lie upon them,
[Lev 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#017.md). The best friendship is
friendship to the soul. We are not told how Pilate turned this off,
probably with a jest; but by his proceeding against the just man it
appears that he did not regard it. Thus faithful admonitions are made
light of, when they are given as warnings against sin, but will not be
so easily made light of, when they shall be reflected upon as
aggravations of sin.

(5.) The chief priests and the elders were busy, all this while, to
influence the people in favour of Barabbas, [Mat
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#020.md). They persuaded the multitude,
both by themselves and their emissaries, whom they sent abroad among
them, that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus; suggesting that
this Jesus was a deceiver, in league with Satan, an enemy to their
church and temple; that, if he were let alone, the Romans would come,
and take away their place and nation; that Barabbas, though a bad man,
yet, having not the interest that Jesus had, could not do so much
mischief. Thus they managed the mob, who otherwise were well affected to
Jesus, and, if they had not been so much at the beck of their priests,
would never have done such a preposterous thing as to prefer Barabbas
before Jesus. Here, \[1.\] We cannot but look upon these wicked priests
with indignation; by the law, in matters of controversy between blood
and blood, the people were to be guided by the priests, and to do as
they informed them, [Deu 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#008.md), [Deu
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#009.md). This great power put into their
hands they wretchedly abused, and the leaders of the people caused them
to err. \[2.\] We cannot but look upon the deluded people with pity; I
have compassion on the multitude, to see them hurried thus violently to
so great wickedness, to see them thus priest-ridden, and falling in the
ditch with their blind leaders.

(6.) Being thus over-ruled by the priests, at length they made their
choice, [Mat 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#021.md). Whether of the
twain (saith Pilate) will ye that I release unto you? He hoped that he
had gained his point, to have Jesus released. But, to his great
surprise, they said Barabbas; as if his crimes were less, and therefore
he less deserved to die; or as if his merits were greater, and therefore
he better deserved to live. The cry for Barabbas was so universal, one
and all, that there was no colour to demand a poll between the
candidates. Be astonished, O heavens, at this, and, thou earth, be
horribly afraid! Were ever men that pretended to reason or religion,
guilty of such prodigious madness, such horrid wickedness! This was it
that Peter charged so home upon them ([Act
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#014).md); Ye desired a murderer to be
granted to you; yet multitudes who choose the world, rather than God,
for their ruler and portion, thus choose their own delusions.

2\. Their pressing earnestly to have Jesus crucified, [Mat
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#022.md), [Mat
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#023.md). Pilate, being amazed at their
choice of Barabbas, was willing to hope that it was rather from a
fondness for him than from an enmity to Jesus; and therefore he puts it
to them, "What shall I do then with Jesus? Shall I release him likewise,
for the greater honour of your feast, or will you leave it to me?" No,
they all said, Let him be crucified. That death they desired he might
die, because it was looked upon as the most scandalous and ignominious;
and they hoped thereby to make his followers ashamed to own him, and
their relation to him. It was absurd for them to prescribe to the judge
what sentence he should pass; but their malice and rage made them forget
all rules of order and decency, and turned a court of justice into a
riotous, tumultuous, and seditious assembly. Now was truth fallen in the
street, and equity could not enter; where one looked for judgment,
behold, oppression, the worst kind of oppression; for righteousness,
behold, a cry, the worse cry that ever was, Crucify, crucify the Lord of
glory. Though they that cried thus, perhaps, were not the same persons
that the other day cried Hosanna, yet see what a change was made upon
the mind of the populace in a little time: when he rode in triumph into
Jerusalem, so general were the acclamations of praise, that one would
have thought he had no enemies; but now when he was led in triumph to
Pilate's judgment-seat, so general were the outcries of enmity, that one
would think he had no friends. Such revolutions are there in this
changeable world, through which our way to heaven lies, as our Master's
did, by honour and dishonour, by evil report, and good report,
counter-changed ([Co2 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#008).md); that we
may not be lifted up by honour, as if, when we were applauded and
caressed, we had made our nest among the stars, and should die in that
nest; nor yet be dejected or discouraged by dishonour, as if, when we
were trodden to the lowest hell, from which there is no redemption.
Bides tu istos qui te laudant; omnes aut sunt hostes, aut (quod in aequo
est) esse possunt - You observe those who applaud you; either they are
all your enemies, or, which is equivalent, they may become so. Seneca de
Vita Beat.

Now, as to this demand, we are further told,

(1.) How Pilate objected against it; Why, what evil hath he done? A
proper question to ask before we censure any in common discourse, much
more for a judge to ask before he pass a sentence of death. Note, It is
much for the honour of the Lord Jesus, that, though he suffered as an
evil-doer, yet neither his judge nor his prosecutors could find that he
had done any evil. Had he done any evil against God? No, he always did
those things that pleased him. Had he done any evil against the civil
government? No, as he did himself, so he taught others, to render to
Caesar the things that were Caesar's. Had he done any evil against the
public peace? No, he did not strive or cry, nor did his kingdom come
with observation. Had he done any evil to particular persons? Whose ox
had he taken, or whom had he defrauded? No, so far from that, that he
went about doing good. This repeated assertion of his unspotted
innocency, plainly intimates that he died to satisfy for the sins of
others; for if it had not been for our transgressions that he was thus
wounded, and for our offences that he was delivered up, and that upon
his own voluntary undertaking to atone for them, I see not how these
extraordinary sufferings of a person that had never thought, said, or
done, any thing amiss, could be reconciled with the justice and equity
of that providence that governs the world, and at least permitted this
to be done in it.

(2.) How they insisted upon it; They cried out the more, Let him be
crucified. They do not go about to show any evil he had done, but, right
or wrong, he must be crucified. Quitting all pretensions to the proof of
the premises, they resolve to hold the conclusion, and what was wanting
in evidence to make up in clamour; this unjust judge was wearied by
importunity into an unjust sentence, as he in the parable into a just
one ([Luk 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#004.md), [Luk
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#005).md), and the cause carried purely by
noise.

III\. Here is the devolving of the guilt of Christ's blood upon the
people and priests.

1\. Pilate endeavours to transfer it from himself, [Mat
27:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#024.md).

(1.) He sees it to no purpose to contend. What he said, \[1.\] Would do
no good; he could prevail nothing; he could not convince them what an
unjust unreasonable thing it was for him to condemn a man whom he
believed innocent, and whom they could not prove guilty. See how strong
the stream of lust and rage sometimes is; neither authority nor reason
will prevail to give check to it. Nay, \[2.\] It was more likely to do
hurt; he saw that rather a tumult was made. This rude and brutish people
fell to high words, and began to threaten Pilate what they would do if
he did not gratify them; and how great a matter might this fire kindle,
especially when the priests, those great incendiaries, blew the coals!
Now this turbulent tumultuous temper of the Jews, by which Pilate was
awed to condemn Christ against his conscience, contributed more than any
thing to the ruin of that nation not long after; for their frequent
insurrections provoked the Romans to destroy them, though they had
reduced them, and their inveterate quarrels among themselves made them
an easy prey to the common enemy. Thus their sin was their ruin.

Observe how easily we may be mistaken in the inclination of the common
people; the priests were apprehensive that their endeavours to seize
Christ would have caused an uproar, especially on the feast day; but it
proved that Pilate's endeavour to save him, caused an uproar, and that
on the feast day; so uncertain are the sentiments of the crowd.

(2.) This puts him into a great strait, betwixt the peace of his own
mind, and the peace of the city; he is loth to condemn an innocent man,
and yet loth to disoblige the people, and raise a devil that would not
be soon laid. Had he steadily and resolutely adhered to the sacred laws
of justice, as a judge ought to do, he had not been in any perplexity;
the matter was plain and past dispute, that a man in whom was found no
faulty, ought not to be crucified, upon any pretence whatsoever, nor
must an unjust thing be done, to gratify any man or company of men in
the world; the cause is soon decided; Let justice be done, though heaven
and earth come together - Fiat justitia, ruat coelum. If wickedness
proceed from the wicked, though they be priests, yet my hand shall not
be upon him.

(3.) Pilate thinks to trim the matter, and to pacify both the people and
his own conscience too, by doing it, and yet disowning it, acting the
thing, and yet acquitting himself from it at the same time. Such
absurdities and self-contradictions do they run upon, whose convictions
are strong, but their corruptions stronger. Happy is he (saith the
apostle, [Rom 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#022).md) that condemneth
not himself in that thing which he alloweth; or, which is all one, that
allows not himself in that thing which he condemns.

Now Pilate endeavours to clear himself from the guilt,

\[1.\] By a sign; He took water, and washed his hands before the
multitude; not as if he thought thereby to cleanse himself from any
guilt contracted before God, but to acquit himself before the people,
from so much as contracting any guilt in this matter; as if he had said,
"If it be done, bear witness that it is none of my doing." He borrowed
the ceremony from that law which appointed it to be used for the
clearing of the country from the guilt of an undiscovered murder ([Deu
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#006.md), [Deu
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#007).md); and he used it the more to
affect the people with the conviction he was under of the prisoner's
innocency; and, probably, such was the noise of the rabble, that, if he
had not used some such surprising sign, in the view of them all, he
could not have been heard.

\[2.\] By a saying; in which, First, He clears himself; I am innocent of
the blood of this just person. What nonsense was this, to condemn him,
and yet protest that he was innocent of his blood! For men to protest
against a thing, and yet to practise it, is only to proclaim that they
sin against their consciences. Though Pilate professed his innocency,
God charges him with guilt, [Act 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#027.md).
Some think to justify themselves, by pleading that their hands were not
in the sin; but David kills by the sword of the children of Ammon, and
Ahab by the elders of Jezreel. Pilate here thinks to justify himself, by
pleading that his heart was not in the action; but this is an averment
which will never be admitted. Protestatio non valet contra factum - In
vain does he protest against the deed which at the same time he
perpetrates. Secondly, He casts it upon the priests and people; "See ye
to it; if it must be done, I cannot help it, do you answer it before God
and the world." Note, Sin is a brat that nobody is willing to own; and
many deceive themselves with this, that they shall bear no blame if they
can but find any to lay the blame upon; but it is not so easy a thing to
transfer the guilt of sin as many think it is. The condition of him that
is infected with the plague is not the less dangerous, either for his
catching the infection from others, or his communicating the infection
to others; we may be tempted to sin, but cannot be forced. The priests
threw it upon Judas; See thou to it; and now Pilate throws it upon them;
See ye to it; for with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to
you.

2\. The priests and people consented to take the guilt upon themselves;
they all said, "His blood be on us, and one our children; we are so well
assured that there is neither sin nor danger in putting him to death,
that we are willing to run the hazard of it;" as if the guilt would do
no harm to them or theirs. They saw that it was the dread of guilt that
made Pilate hesitate, and that he was getting over this difficulty by a
fancy of transferring it; to prevent the return of his hesitation, and
to confirm him in that fancy, they, in the heat of their rage, agreed to
it, rather than lose the prey they had in their hands, and cried, His
blood be upon us. Now,

(1.) By this they designed to indemnify Pilate, that is, to make him
think himself indemnified, by becoming bound to divine justice, to save
him harmless. But those that are themselves bankrupts and beggars will
never be admitted security for others, nor taken as a bail for them.
None could bear the sin of others, except him that had none of his own
to answer for; it is a bold undertaking, and too big for any creature,
to become bound for a sinner to Almighty God.

(2.) But they did really imprecate wrath and vengeance upon themselves
and their posterity. What a desperate word was this, and how little did
they think what as the direful import of it, or to what an abyss of
misery it would bring them and theirs! Christ had lately told them, that
upon them would come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from
that of the righteous Abel; but as if that were too little, they here
imprecate upon themselves the guilt of that blood which was more
precious than all the rest, and the guilt of which would lie heavier. O
the daring presumption of wilful sinners, that run upon God, upon his
neck, and defy his justice! [Job
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#025.md), [Job
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#026.md). Observe,

\[1.\] How cruel they were in their imprecation. They imprecated the
punishment of this sin, not only upon themselves, but upon their
children too, even those that were yet unborn, without so much as
limiting the entail of the curse, as God himself had been pleased to
limit it, to the third and fourth generation. It was madness to pull it
upon themselves, but the height of barbarity to entail it on their
posterity. Surely they were like the ostrich; they were hardened against
their young ones, as though they were not theirs. What a dreadful
conveyance was this of guilt and wrath to them and their heirs for ever,
and this delivered by joint consent, nemine contradicents - unanimously,
as their own act and deed; which certainly amounted to a forfeiture and
defeasance of that ancient charter, I will be a God to thee, and to thy
seed. Their entailing the curse of the Messiah's blood upon their
nation, cut off the entail of the blessings of that blood from their
families, that, according to another promise made to Abraham, in him all
the families of the earth might be blessed. See what enemies wicked men
are to their own children and families; those that damn their own souls,
care not how many they take to hell with them.

\[2.\] How righteous God was, in his retribution according to this
imprecation; they said, His blood be on us, and on our children; and God
said Amen to it, so shall thy doom be; as they loved cursing, so it came
upon them. The wretched remains of that abandoned people feel it to this
day; from the time they imprecated this blood upon them, they were
followed with one judgment after another, till they were quite laid
waste, and made an astonishment, a hissing, and a byword; yet on some of
them, and some of theirs, this blood came, not to condemn them, but to
save them; divine mercy, upon their repenting and believing, cut off
this entail, and then the promise was again to them, and to their
children. God is better to us and ours than we are.

[Matthew 27:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 27:26</span></span>

In these verses we have the preparatives for, and prefaces to, the
crucifixion of our Lord Jesus. Here is,

I. The sentence passed, and the warrant signed for his execution; and
this immediately, the same hour.

1\. Barabbas was released, that notorious criminal: if he had not been
put in competition with Christ for the favour of the people, it is
probable that he had died for his crimes; but that proved the means of
his escape; to intimate that Christ was condemned for this purpose, that
sinners, even the chief of sinners, might be released; he was delivered
up, that we might be delivered; whereas the common instance of divine
Providence, is, that the wicked is a ransom for the righteous, and the
transgressor for the upright, [Pro
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#018.md); [Pro
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#018.md). In this unparalleled instance
of divine grace, the upright is a ransom for the transgressors, the just
for the unjust.

2\. Jesus was scourged; this was an ignominious cruel punishment,
especially as is was inflicted by the Romans, who were not under the
moderation of the Jewish law, which forbade scourgings, above forty
stripes; this punishment was most unreasonably inflicted on one that was
sentenced to die: the rods were not to introduce the axes, but to
supersede them. Thus the scripture was fulfilled, The ploughers ploughed
upon my back ([Psa 129:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#003).md), I gave my
back to the smiters ([Isa 50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006).md), and,
By his stripes we are healed, [Isa
53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005.md). He was chastised with whips,
that we might not be for ever chastised with scorpions.

3\. He was then delivered to be crucified; though his chastisement was
in order to our peace, yet there is no peace made but by the blood of
his cross ([Col 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020).md); therefore the
scourging is not enough, he must be crucified; a kind of death used only
among the Romans; the manner of it is such, that it seems to be the
result of wit and cruelty in combination, each putting forth itself to
the utmost, to make death in the highest degree terrible and miserable.
A cross was set up in the ground, to which the hands and feet were
nailed, on which nails the weight of the body hung, till it died of the
pain. This was the death to which Christ was condemned, that he might
answer the type of the brazen serpent lifted up upon a pole. It was a
bloody death, a painful, shameful, cursed death; it was so miserable a
death, that merciful princes appointed those who were condemned to it by
the law, to be strangled first, and then nailed to the cross; so Julius
Caesar did by some pirates, Sueton. lib. 1. Constantine, the first
Christian emperor, by an edict abolished the use of that punishment
among the Romans, Sozomen, Hist. lib. 1. ch. 8. Ne salutare signum
subserviret ad perniciem - That the symbol of salvation might not be
subservient to the victim's destruction.

II\. The barbarous treatment which the soldiers gave him, while things
were getting ready for his execution. When he was condemned, he ought to
have had some time allowed him to prepare for death. There was a law
made by the Roman senate, in Tiberius's time, perhaps upon complaint of
this and the like precipitation, that the execution of criminals should
be deferred at least ten days after sentence. Sueton in Tiber. cap. 25.
But there were scarcely allowed so many minutes to our Lord Jesus; nor
had he any breathing-time during those minutes; it was a crisis, and
there were no lucid intervals allowed him; deep called unto deep, and
the storm continued without any intermission.

When he was delivered to be crucified, that was enough; they that kill
the body, yield that there is no more that they can do, but Christ's
enemies will do more, and, if it be possible, wrap up a thousand deaths
in one. Though Pilate pronounced him innocent, yet his soldiers, his
guards, set themselves to abuse him, being swayed more by the fury of
the people against him, than by their master's testimony for him; the
Jewish rabble infected the Roman soldiery, or perhaps it was not so much
in spite to him, as to make sport for themselves, that they thus abused
him. They understood that he pretended to a crown; to taunt him with
that gave them some diversion, and an opportunity to make themselves and
one another merry. Note, It is an argument of a base, servile, sordid
spirit, to insult over those that are in misery, and to make the
calamities of any matter of sport and merriment.

Observe, 1. Where this was done - in the common hall. The governor's
house, which should have been a shelter to the wronged and abused, is
made the theatre of this barbarity. I wonder that the governor, who was
so desirous to acquit himself from the blood of this just person, would
suffer this to be done in his house. Perhaps he did not order it to be
done, but he connived at it; and those in authority will be accountable,
not only for the wickedness which they do, or appoint, but for that
which they do not restrain, when it is in the power of their hands.
Masters of families should not suffer their houses to be places of abuse
to any, nor their servants to make sport with the sins, or miseries, or
religion, of others.

2\. Who were concerned in it. They gathered the whole band, the soldiers
that were to attend the execution, would have the whole regiment (at
least five hundred, some think twelve or thirteen hundred) to share in
the diversion. If Christ was thus made a spectacle, let none of his
followers think it strange to be so used, [Co1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#009.md); [Heb
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#033.md).

3\. What particular indignities were done him.

(1.) They stripped him, [Mat 27:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#028.md).
The shame of nakedness came in with sin ([Gen
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#007).md); and therefore Christ, when he
came to satisfy for sin, and take it away, was made naked, and submitted
to that shame, that he might prepare for us white raiment, to cover us,
[Rev 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#018.md).

(2.) They put on him a scarlet robe, some old red cloak, such as the
Roman soldiers wore, in imitation of the scarlet robes which kings and
emperors wore; thus upbraiding him with his being called a King. This
sham of majesty they put upon him in his dress, when nothing but
meanness and misery appeared in his countenance, only to expose him to
the spectators, as the more ridiculous; yet there was something of
mystery in it; this was he that was red in his apparel ([Isa
63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md), [Isa
63:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#002).md), that washed his garments in
wine ([Gen 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#011).md); therefore he was
dressed in a scarlet robe. Our sins were as scarlet and crimson. Christ
being clad in a scarlet robe, signified his bearing our sins, to his
shame, in his own body upon the tree; that we might wash our robes, and
make them white, in the blood of the Lamb.

(3.) They platted a crown of thorns, and put it upon his head, [Mat
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#029.md). This was to carry on the humour
of making him a mock-king; yet, had they intended it only for a
reproach, they might have platted a crown of straw, or rushes, but they
designed it to be painful to him, and to be literally, what crowns are
said to be figuratively, lined with thorns; he that invented this abuse,
it is likely, valued himself upon the wit of it; but there was a mystery
in it. \[1.\] Thorns came in with sin, and were part of the curse that
was the product of sin, [Gen 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#018.md).
Therefore Christ, being made a curse for us, and dying to remove the
curse from us, felt the pain and smart of those thorns, nay, and binds
them as a crown to him ([Job 31:36](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#036).md);
for his sufferings for us were his glory. \[2.\] Now he answered to the
type of Abraham's ram that was caught in the thicket, and so offered up
instead of Isaac, [Gen 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#013.md). \[3.\]
Thorns signify afflictions, [Ch2
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#011.md). These Christ put into a crown;
so much did he alter the property of them to them that are his, giving
them cause to glory in tribulation, and making it to work for them a
weight of glory. \[4.\] Christ was crowned with thorns, to show that his
kingdom was not of this world, nor the glory of it worldly glory, but is
attended here with bonds and afflictions, while the glory of it is to be
revealed. \[5.\] It was the custom of some heathen nations, to bring
their sacrifices to the altars, crowned with garlands; these thorns were
the garlands with which this great Sacrifice was crowned. \[6.\] these
thorns, it is likely, fetched blood from his blessed head, which
trickled down his face, like the previous ointment (typifying the blood
of Christ with which he consecrated himself) upon the head, which ran
down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard, [Psa
133:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#002.md). Thus, when he came to espouse
to himself his love, his dove, his undefiled church, his head was filled
with dew, and his locks with the drops of the night, [Sol
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002.md).

(4.) They put a reed in his right hand; this was intended for a
mock-sceptre, another of the insignia of the majesty they jeered him
with; as if this were a sceptre good enough for such a King, as was like
a reed shaken with the wind ([Mat
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#007).md); like sceptre, like kingdom,
both weak and wavering, and withering and worthless; but they were quite
mistaken, for his throne is for ever and ever, and the sceptre of his
kingdom is a right sceptre, [Psa 45:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006.md).

(5.) They bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King
of the Jews! Having made him a sham King, they thus make a jest of doing
homage to him, thus ridiculing his pretensions to sovereignty, as
Joseph's brethren ([Gen 37:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#008).md); Shalt
thou indeed reign over us? But as they were afterward compelled to do
obeisance to him, and enrich his dreams, so these here bowed the knee,
in scorn to him who was, soon after this, exalted to the right hand of
God, that at his name every knee might bow, or break before him; it is
ill jesting with that which, sooner or later, will come in earnest.

(6.) They spit upon him; thus he had been abused in the High Priest's
hall, [Mat 26:67](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#067.md). In doing homage, the
subject kissed the sovereign, in token of his allegiance; thus Samuel
kissed Saul, and we are bid to kiss the Son: but they, in this
mock-homage, instead of kissing him, spit in his face; that blessed face
which outshines the sun, and before which the angels cover theirs, was
thus polluted. It is strange that the sons of men should ever do such a
piece of villany, and that the Son of God should ever suffer such a
piece of ignominy.

(7.) They took the reed, and smote him on the head. That which they had
made the mock-ensign of his royalty, they now make the real instrument
of their cruelty, and his pain. They smote him, it is probable, upon the
crown of thorns, and so struck them into his head, that they might wound
it the deeper, which made the more sport for them, to whom his pain was
the greatest pleasure. Thus was he despised and rejected of men; a man
of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. All this misery and shame he
underwent, that he might purchase for us everlasting life, and joy, and
glory.

III\. The conveying of him to the place of execution. After they had
mocked and abused him, as long as they thought fit, they then took the
robe off from him; to signify their divesting him of all the kingly
authority they had invested him with, by putting it on him; and they put
his own raiment on him, because that was to fall to the soldiers' share,
that were employed in the execution. They took off the robe, but no
mention is made of their taking off the crown of thorns, whence it is
commonly supposed (though there is no certainty of it) that he was
crucified with that on his head; for as he is a Priest upon his throne,
so he was a King upon his cross. Christ was led to be crucified in his
own raiment, because he himself was to bear our sins in his own body
upon the tree. And here,

1\. They led him away to be crucified; he was led as a lamb to the
slaughter, as a sacrifice to the altar. We may well imagine how they
hurried him on, and dragged him along, with all the speed possible, lest
any thing should intervene to prevent the glutting of their cruel rage
with his precious blood. It is probable that they now loaded him with
taunts and reproaches, and treated him as the off-scouring of all
things. They led him away out of the city; for Christ, that he might
sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate ([Heb
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#012).md), as if he that was the glory of
them that waited for redemption in Jerusalem was not worthy to live
among them. To this he himself had an eye, when in the parable he speaks
of his being cast out of the vineyard, [Mat
21:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#039.md).

2\. They compelled Simon of Cyrene to bear his cross, [Mat
27:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#032.md). It seems, at first he carried
the cross himself, as Isaac carried the wood for the burnt-offering,
which was to burn him. And this was intended, as other things, both for
pain and shame to him. But after a while they took the cross off from
him, either, (1.) In compassion to him, because they saw it was too
great a load for him. We can hardly think that they had any
consideration of that, yet it teaches us that God considers the frame of
his people, and will not suffer them to be tempted above what they are
able; he gives them some breathing-time, but they must expect that the
cross will return, and the lucid intervals only give them space to
prepare for the next fit. But, (2.) Perhaps it was because he could not,
with the cross on his back, go forward so fast as they would have him.
Or, (3.) They were afraid, lest he should faint away under the load of
his cross, and die, and so prevent what their malice further intended to
do against him: thus even the tender mercies of the wicked (which seem
to be so) are really cruel. Taking the cross off from him, they
compelled one Simon of Cyrene to bear it, pressing him to the service by
the authority of the governor or the priests. It was a reproach, and
none would do it but by compulsion. Some think that this Simon was a
disciple of Christ, at least a well-wisher to him, and that they knew
it, and therefore put this upon him. Note, All that will approve
themselves disciples indeed, must follow Christ, bearing his cross ([Mat
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#024).md), bearing his reproach, [Heb
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#013.md). We must know the fellowship of
his sufferings for us, and patiently submit to all the sufferings for
him we are called out to; for those only shall reign with him, that
suffer with him; shall sit with him in his kingdom, that drink of his
cup, and are baptized with his baptism.

[Matthew 27:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mat 27:33</span></span>

We have here the crucifixion of our Lord Jesus.

I. The place where our Lord Jesus was put to death.

1\. They came to a place called Golgotha, near adjoining to Jerusalem,
probably the common place of execution. If he had had a house of his own
in Jerusalem, probably, for his greater disgrace, they would have
crucified him before his own door. But now in the same place where
criminals were sacrificed to the justice of the government, was our Lord
Jesus sacrificed to the justice of God. Some think that it was called
the place of a skull, because it was the common charnel-house, where the
bones and skulls of dead men were laid together out of the way, lest
people should touch them, and be defiled thereby. Here lay the trophies
of death's victory over multitudes of the children of men; and when by
dying Christ would destroy death, he added this circumstance of honour
to his victory, that he triumphed over death upon his own dunghill.

2\. There they crucified him ([Mat
27:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#035).md), nailed his hands and feet to
the cross, and then reared it up, and him hanging on it; for so the
manner of the Romans was to crucify. Let our hearts be touched with the
feeling of that exquisite pain which our blessed Saviour now endured,
and let us look upon him who was thus pierced, and mourn. Was ever
sorrow like unto his sorrow? And when we behold what manner of death he
died, let us in that behold with what manner of love he loved us.

II\. The barbarous and abusive treatment they gave him, in which their
wit and malice vied which should excel. As if death, so great a death,
were not bad enough, they contrived to add to the bitterness and terror
of it.

1\. By the drink they provided for him before he was nailed to the
cross, [Mat 27:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#034.md). It was usual to
have a cup of spiced wine for those to drink of, that were to be put to
death, according to Solomon's direction ([Pro
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#006.md), [Pro
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#007).md), Give strong drink to him that
is ready to perish; but with that cup which Christ was to drink of, they
mingled vinegar and gall, to make it sour and bitter. This signified,
(1.) The sin of man, which is a root of bitterness, bearing gall and
wormwood, [Deu 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#018.md). The sinner
perhaps rolls it under his tongue as a sweet morsel, but to God it is
grapes of gall, [Deu 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032.md). It was so
to the Lord Jesus, when he bare our sins, and sooner or later it will be
so to the sinner himself, bitterness at the latter end, more bitter than
death, [Ecc 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026). (2..md) It signified
the wrath of God, that cup which is Father put into his hand, a bitter
cup indeed, like the bitter water which caused the curse, [Num
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#018.md). This drink they offered him, as
was literally foretold, [Psa 69:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#021.md).
And, \[1.\] He tasted thereof, and so had the worst of it, took the
bitter taste into his mouth; he let no bitter cup go by him untasted,
when he was making atonement for all our sinful tasting of forbidden
fruit; now he was tasting death in its full bitterness. \[2.\] He would
not drink it, because he would not have the best of it; would have
nothing like an opiate to lessen his sense of pain, for he would die so
as to feel himself die, because he had so much work to do, as our High
Priest, in his suffering work.

2\. By the dividing of his garments, [Mat
27:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#035.md). When they nailed him to the
cross, they stripped him of his garments, at least his upper garments;
for by sin we were made naked, to our shame, and thus he purchased for
us white raiment to cover us. If we be at any time stripped of our
comforts for Christ, let us bear it patiently; he was stripped for us.
Enemies may strip us of our clothes, but cannot strip us of our best
comforts; cannot take from us the garments of praise. The clothes of
those that are executed are the executioner's fee: four soldiers were
employed in crucifying Christ, and they must each of them have a share:
his upper garment, if it were divided, would be of no use to any of
them, and therefore they agreed to cast lots for it. (1.) Some think
that the garment was so fine and rich, that it was worth contending for;
but that agreed not with the poverty Christ appeared in. (2.) Perhaps
they had heard of those that had been cured by touching the hem of his
garment, and they thought it valuable for some magic virtue in it. Or,
(3.) They hoped to get money of his friends for such a sacred relic. Or,
(4.) Because, in derision, they would seem to put a value upon it, as
royal clothing. Or, (5.) It was for diversion; to pass away the time
while they waited for his death, they would play a game at dice for the
clothes; but, whatever they designed, the word of God is herein
accomplished. In that famous psalm, the first words of which Christ made
use of upon the cross, it was said, They parted my garments among them,
and cast lots upon my vesture, [Psa
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#018.md). This was never true of David,
but looks primarily at Christ, of whom David, in spirit, spoke. Then is
the offence of this part of the cross ceased; for it appears to have
been by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God. Christ
stripped himself of his glories, to divide them among us.

They now sat down, and watched him, [Mat
27:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#036.md). The chief priests were careful,
no doubt, in setting this guard, lest the people, whom they still stood
in awe of, should rise, and rescue him. But Providence so ordered it,
that those who were appointed to watch him, thereby became
unexceptionable witnesses for him; having the opportunity to see and
hear that which extorted from them that noble confession ([Mat
27:54](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#054).md), Truly this was the Son of God.

3\. By the title set up over his head, [Mat
27:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#037.md). It was usual for the
vindicating of public justice, and putting the greater shame upon
malefactors that were executed, not only by a crier to proclaim before
them, but by a writing also over their heads to notify what was the
crime for which they suffered; so they set up over Christ's head his
accusation written, to give public notice of the charge against him;
This is Jesus the King of the Jews. This they designed for his reproach,
but God so overruled it, that even his accusation redounded to his
honour. For, (1.) Here was no crime alleged against him. It is not said
that he was a pretended Saviour, or a usurping King, though they would
have it thought so ([Joh 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#021).md); but,
This is Jesus, a Saviour; surely that was no crime; and, This is the
King of the Jews; nor was that a crime; for they expected that the
Messiah should be so: so that, his enemies themselves being judges, he
did no evil. Nay, (2.) Here was a very glorious truth asserted
concerning him - that he is Jesus the King of the Jews, that King whom
the Jews expected and ought to have submitted to; so that his accusation
amounts to this, That he was the true Messiah and Saviour of the world;
as Balaam, when he was sent for to curse Israel, blessed them all
together, and that three times ([Num
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#010).md), so Pilate, instead of accusing
Christ as a Criminal, proclaimed him a King, and that three times, in
three inscriptions. Thus God makes men to serve his purposes, quite
beyond their own.

4\. By his companions with him in suffering, [Mat
27:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#038.md). There were two thieves
crucified with him at the same time, in the same place, under the same
guard; two highway-men, or robbers upon the road, as the word properly
signifies. It is probable that this was appointed to be execution-day;
and therefore they hurried the prosecution of Christ in the morning,
that they might have him ready to be executed with the other criminals.
Some think that Pilate ordered it thus, that this piece of necessary
justice, in executing these thieves, might atone for his injustice in
condemning Christ; others, that the Jews contrived it, to add to the
ignominy of the sufferings of our Lord Jesus; however it was, the
scripture was fulfilled in it ([Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012).md), He was numbered with the
transgressors.

(1.) It was a reproach to him, that he was crucified with them. Though,
while he lived, he was separate from sinners, yet in their deaths they
were not divided, but he was made to partake with the vilest malefactors
in their plagues, as if he had been a partaker with them in their sins;
for he was made sin for us, and took upon him the likeness of sinful
flesh. He was, at his death, numbered among the transgressors, and had
his lot with the wicked, that we, at our death, might be numbered among
the saints, and have our lot among the chosen.

(2.) It was an additional reproach, that he was crucified in the midst,
between them, as if he had been the worst of the three, the principal
malefactor; for among three the middle is the place for the chief. Every
circumstance was contrived to his dishonour, as if the great Saviour
were of all others the greatest sinner. It was also intended to ruffle
and discompose him, in his last moments, with the shrieks, and groans,
and blasphemies, of these malefactors, who, it is likely, made a hideous
outcry when they were nailed to the cross; but thus would Christ affect
himself with the miseries of sinners, when he was suffering for their
salvation. Some of Christ's apostles were afterwards crucified, as
Peter, and Andrew, but none of them were crucified with him, lest it
should have looked as if they had been joint undertakers with him, in
satisfying for man's sin, and joint purchasers of life and glory;
therefore he was crucified between two malefactors, who could not be
supposed to contribute any thing to the merit of his death; for he
himself bare our sins in his own body.

5\. By the blasphemies and revilings with which they loaded him when he
was hanging upon the cross; though we read not that they cast any
reflections on the thieves that were crucified with him. One would have
thought that, when they had nailed him to the cross, they had done their
worst, and malice itself had been exhausted: indeed if a criminal be put
into the pillory, or carted, because it is a punishment less than death,
it is usually attended with such expressions of abuse; but a dying man,
though an infamous man, should be treated with compassion. It is an
insatiable revenge indeed which will not be satisfied with death, so
great a death. But, to complete the humiliation of the Lord Jesus, and
to show that, when he was dying, he was bearing iniquity, he was then
loaded with reproach, and, for aught that appears, not one of his
friends, who the other day cried Hosanna to him, durst be seen to show
him any respect.

(1.) The common people, that passed by, reviled him. His extreme misery
and exemplary patience under it, did not mollify them, or make them to
relent; but they who by their outcries brought him to this, now think to
justify themselves in it by their reproaches, as if they did well to
condemn him. They reviled him: eblasphēmoun - they blasphemed him; and
blasphemy it was, in the strictest sense, speaking evil of him who
thought it not robbery to be equal with God. Observe here,

\[1.\] The persons that reviled him; they that passed by, the travellers
that went along the road, and it was a great road, leading from
Jerusalem to Gibeon; they were possessed with prejudices against him by
the reports and clamours of the High Priest's creatures. It is a hard
thing, and requires more application and resolution than is ordinarily
met with, to keep up a good opinion of persons and things that are every
where run down, and spoken against. Every one is apt to say as the most
say, and to throw a stone at that which is put into an ill name. Turba
Remi sequitur fortunam semper et odit damnatos - The Roman rabble
fluctuate with a man's fluctuating fortunes, and fail not to depress
those that are sinking. Juvenal.

\[2.\] The gesture they used, in contempt of him - wagging their heads;
which signifies their triumph in his fall, and their insulting over him,
[Isa 37:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#022.md).; [Jer
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#016.md); [Lam
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#015.md). The language of it was, Aha, so
would we have it, [Psa 35:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#025.md). Thus
they insulted over him that was the Saviour of their country, as the
Philistines did over Samson the destroyer of their country. This very
gesture was prophesied of ([Psa 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#007).md);
They shake the head at me. And [Psa
109:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#025.md).

\[3.\] The taunts and jeers they uttered. These are here recorded.

First, They upbraided him with his destroying of the temple. Though the
judges themselves were sensible that what he had said of that was
misrepresented (as appears [Mar
14:59](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#059).md), yet they industriously spread
it among the people, to bring an odium upon him, that he had a design to
destroy the temple; than which nothing would more incense the people
against him. And this was not the only time that the enemies of Christ
had laboured to make others believe that of religion and the people of
God, which they themselves have known to be false, and the charge unjust
"Thou that destroyest the temple, that vast and strong fabric, try thy
strength now in plucking up that cross, and drawing those nails, and so
save thyself; if thou hast the power thou hast boasted of, this is a
proper time to exert it, and give proof of it; for it is supposed that
every man will do his utmost to save himself." This made the cross of
Christ such a stumbling-block to the Jews, that they looked upon it to
be inconsistent with the power of the Messiah; he was crucified in
weakness ([Co2 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#004).md), so it seemed to
them; but indeed Christ crucified is the Power of God.

Secondly, They upbraided him with his saying that he was the Son of God;
If thou be so, say they, come down from the cross. Now they take the
devil's words out of his mouth, with which he tempted him in the
wilderness ([Mat 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#003.md), [Mat
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#006).md), and renew the same assault; If
thou be the Son of God. They think that now, or never, he must prove
himself to be the Son of God; forgetting that he had proved it by the
miracles he wrought, particularly his raising of the dead; and unwilling
to wait for the complete proof of it by his own resurrection, to which
he had so often referred himself and them; which, if they had observed
it, would have anticipated the offence of the cross. This comes of
judging things by the present aspect of them, without a due remembrance
of what is past, and a patient expectation of what may further be
produced.

(2.) The chief priests and scribes, the church rulers, and the elders,
the state rulers, they mocked him, [Mat
27:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#041.md). They did not think it enough to
invite the rabble to do it, but gave Christ the dishonour, and
themselves the diversion, or reproaching him in their own proper
persons. They should have been in the temple at their devotion, for it
was the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, when there was to be
a holy convocation ([Lev 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#007).md); but
they were here at the place of execution, spitting their venom at the
Lord Jesus. How much below the grandeur and gravity of their character
was this! Could any thing tend more to make them contemptible and base
before the people? One would have thought, that, though they neither
feared God nor regarded man, yet common prudence should have taught them
who had so great a hand in Christ's death, to keep as much as might be
behind the curtain, and to play least in sight; but nothing is so mean
as that malice may stick at it. Did they disparage themselves thus, to
do despite to Christ, and shall we be afraid of disparaging ourselves,
by joining with the multitude to do him honour, and not rather say, If
this be to be vile, I will be yet more vile?

Two things the priests and elders upbraided him with.

\[1.\] That he could not save himself, [Mat
27:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#042.md). He had been before abused in
his prophetical and kingly office, and now in his priestly office as a
Saviour. First, They take it for granted that he could not save himself,
and therefore had not the power he pretended to, when really he would
not save himself, because he would die to save us. They should have
argued, "He saved others, therefore he could save himself, and if he do
not, it is for some good reason." But, Secondly, They would insinuate,
that, because he did not now save himself, therefore all his pretence to
save others was but sham and delusion, and was never really done; though
the truth of his miracles was demonstrated beyond contradiction.
Thirdly, They upbraid him with being the King of Israel. They dreamed of
the external pomp and power of the Messiah, and therefore thought the
cross altogether disagreeable to the King of Israel, and inconsistent
with that character. Many people would like the King of Israel well
enough, if he would but come down from the cross, if they could have his
kingdom without the tribulation through which they must enter into it.
But the matter is settled; if no cross, then no Christ, no crown. Those
that would reign with him, must be willing to suffer with him, for
Christ and his cross are nailed together in this world. Fourthly, They
challenged him to come down from the cross. And what had become of us
then, and the work of our redemption and salvation? If he had been
provoked by these scoffs to come down from the cross, and so to have
left his undertaking unfinished, we had been for ever undone. But his
unchangeable love and resolution set him above, and fortified him
against, this temptation, so that he did not fail, nor was discouraged.
Fifthly, They promised that, if he would come down from the cross, they
would believe him. Let him give them that proof of his being the
Messiah, and they will own him to be so. When they had formerly demanded
a sign, he told them that the sign he would give them, should be not his
coming down from the cross, but, which was a greater instance of his
power, his coming up from the grave, which they had not patience to wait
two or three days for. If he had come down from the cross, they might
with as much reason have said that the soldiers had juggled in nailing
him to it, as they said, when he was raised from the dead, that the
disciples came by night, and stole him away. But to promise ourselves
that we would believe, if we had such and such means and motives of
faith as we ourselves would prescribe, when we do not improve what God
has appointed, is not only a gross instance of the deceitfulness of our
hearts, but the sorry refuge, or subterfuge rather, of an obstinate
destroying infidelity.

\[2.\] That God, his Father, would not save him ([Mat
27:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#043).md); He trusted in God, that is, he
pretended to do so; for he said, I am the Son of God. Those who call God
Father, and themselves his children, thereby profess to put a confidence
in him, [Psa 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#010.md). Now they suggest,
that he did but deceive himself and others, when he made himself so much
the darling of heaven; for, if he had been the Son of God (as Job's
friends argued concerning him), he would not have been abandoned to all
this misery, much less abandoned in it. This was a sword in his bones,
as David complains of the like ([Psa
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#010).md); and it was a two-edged sword,
for it was intended, First, To vilify him, and to make the standers-by
think him a deceiver and an impostor; as if his saying, that he was the
Son of God, were now effectually disproved. Secondly, To terrify him,
and drive him to distrust and despair of his Father's power and love;
which some think, was the thing he feared, religiously feared, prayed
against, and was delivered fRom. [Heb
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md). David complained more of the
endeavours of his persecutors to shake his faith, and drive him from his
hope in God, than of their attempts to shake his throne, and drive him
from his kingdom; their saying, There is no help for him in God ([Psa
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002).md), and, God has forsaken him, [Psa
71:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#011.md). In this, as in other things, he
was a type of Christ. Nay, these very words David, in that famous
prophecy of Christ, mentions, as spoken by his enemies ([Psa
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#008).md); He trusted on the Lord that he
would deliver him. Surely these priests and scribes had forgotten their
psalter, or they would not have used the same words, so exactly to
answer the type and prophecy: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.

(3.) To complete the reproach, the thieves also that were crucified with
him were not only not reviled as he was, as if they had been saints
compared with him, but, though fellow-sufferers with him, joined in with
his prosecutors, and cast the same in his teeth; that is, one of them
did, who said, If thou be the Christ, save thyself and us, [Luk
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#039.md). One would think that of all
people this thief had least cause, and should have had least mind, to
banter Christ. Partners in suffering, though for different causes,
usually commiserate one another; and few, whatever they have done
before, will breathe their last in revilings. But, it seems, the
greatest mortifications of the body, and the most humbling rebukes of
Providence, will not of themselves mortify the corruptions of the soul,
nor suppress the wickedness of the wicked, without the grace of God.

Well, thus our Lord Jesus having undertaken to satisfy the justice of
God for the wrong done him in his honour by sin, he did it by suffering
in his honour; not only by divesting himself of that which was due to
him as the Son of God, but by submitting to the utmost indignity that
could be done to the worst of men; because he was made sin for us, he
was thus made a curse for us, to make reproach easy to us, if at any
time we suffer it, and have all manner of evil said against us falsely,
for righteousness' sake.

III\. We have here the frowns of heaven, which our Lord Jesus was under,
in the midst of all these injuries and indignities from men. Concerning
which, observe,

1\. How this was signified - by an extraordinary and miraculous eclipse
of the sun, which continued for three hours, [Mat
27:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#045.md). There was darkness epi pasan
tēn gēn-over all the earth; so most interpreters understand it, though
our translation confines it to that land. Some of the ancients appealed
to the annals of the nation concerning this extraordinary eclipse at the
death of Christ, as a thing well known, and which gave notice to those
parts of the world of something great then in doing; as the sun's going
back in Hezekiah's time did. It is reported that Dionysius, at
Heliopolis in Egypt, took notice of this darkness, and said, Aut Deus
naturae patitur, aut mundi machina dissolvitur - Either the God of
nature is suffering, or the machine of the world is tumbling into ruin.
An extraordinary light gave intelligence of the birth of Christ ([Mat
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002).md), and therefore it was proper that
an extraordinary darkness should notify his death, for he is the Light
of the world. The indignities done to our Lord Jesus, made the heavens
astonished, and horribly afraid, and even put them into disorder and
confusion; such wickedness as this the sun never saw before, and
therefore withdrew, and would not see this. This surprising, amazing,
darkness was designed to stop the mouths of those blasphemers, who were
reviling Christ as he hung on the cross; and it should seem that, for
the present, it struck such a terror upon them, that though their hearts
were not changed, yet they were silent, and stood doubting what this
should mean, till after three hours the darkness scattered, and then (as
appears by [Mat 27:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#047).md), like Pharaoh
when the plague was over, they hardened their hearts. But that which was
principally intended in this darkness, was, (1.) Christ's present
conflict with the powers of darkness. Now the prince of this world, and
his forces, the rulers of the darkness of this world, were to be cast
out, to be spoiled and vanquished; and to make his victory the more
illustrious, he fights them on their own ground; gives them all the
advantage they could have against him by this darkness, lets them take
the wind and sun, and yet baffles them, and so becomes more than a
conqueror. (2.) His present want of heavenly comforts. This darkness
signified that dark cloud which the human soul of our Lord Jesus was now
under. God makes his sun to shine upon the just and upon the unjust; but
even the light of the sun was withheld from our Saviour, when he was
made sin for us. A pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun;
but because now his soul was exceeding sorrowful, and the cup of divine
displeasure was filled to him without mixture, even the light of the sun
was suspended. When earth denied him a drop of cold water, heaven denied
him a beam of light; having to deliver us from utter darkness, he did
himself, in the depth of his sufferings, walk in darkness, and had no
light, [Isa 50:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010.md). During the three
hours that this darkness continued, we do not find that he said one
word, but passed this time in a silent retirement into his own soul,
which was now in agony, wrestling with the powers of darkness, and
taking in the impressions of his Father's displeasure, not against
himself, but the sin of man, which he was now making his soul an
offering for. Never were there three such hours since the day that God
created man upon the earth, never such a dark and awful scene; the
crisis of that great affair of man's redemption and salvation.

2\. How he complained of it ([Mat
27:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#046).md); About the ninth hour, when it
began to clear up, after a long and silent conflict. Jesus cried, Eli,
Eli, lama sabachthani? The words are related in the Syriac tongue, in
which they were spoken, because worthy of double remark, and for the
sake of the perverse construction which his enemies put upon them, in
putting Elias for Eli. Now observe here,

(1.) Whence he borrowed this complaint - from [Psa
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001.md). It is not probable (as some have
thought) that he repeated the whole psalm; yet hereby he intimated that
the whole was to be applied to him, and that David, in spirit, there
spoke of his humiliation and exaltation. This, and that other word, Into
thy hands I commit my spirit, he fetched from David's psalms (though he
could have expressed himself in his own words), to teach us of what use
the word of God is to us, to direct us in prayer, and to recommend to us
the use of scripture-expressions in prayer, which will help our
infirmities.

(2.) How he uttered it - with a loud voice; which bespeaks the extremity
of his pain and anguish, the strength of nature remaining in him, and
the great earnestness of his spirit in this expostulation. Now the
scripture was fulfilled ([Joe 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#015.md),
[Joe 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#016).md); The sun and the moon shall
be darkened. The Lord shall also roar out of Zion, and utter his voice
form Jerusalem. David often speaks of his crying aloud in prayer, [Psa
55:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#017.md).

(3.) What the complaint was - My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?
A strange complaint to come from the mouth of our Lord Jesus, who, we
are sure, was God's elect, in whom his soul delighted ([Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001).md), and one in whom he was always
well pleased. The Father now loved him, nay, he knew that therefore he
loved him, because he laid down his life for the sheep; what, and yet
forsaken of him, and in the midst of his sufferings too! Surely never
sorrow was like unto that sorrow which extorted such a complaint as this
from one who, being perfectly free from sin, could never be a terror to
himself; but the heart knows its own bitterness. No wonder that such a
complaint as this made the earth to quake, and rent the rocks; for it is
enough to make both the ears of every one that hears it to tingle, and
ought to be spoken of with great reverence.

Note, \[1.\] That our Lord Jesus was, in his sufferings, for a time,
forsaken by his Father. So he saith himself, who we are sure was under
no mistake concerning his own case. Not that the union between the
divine and human nature was in the least weakened or shocked; no, he was
now by the eternal Spirit offering himself: nor as if there were any
abatement of his Father's love to him, or his to his Father; we are sure
that there was upon his mind no horror of God, or despair of his favour,
nor any thing of the torments of hell; but his Father forsook him; that
is, First, He delivered him up into the hands of his enemies, and did
not appear to deliver him out of their hands. He let loose the powers of
darkness against him, and suffered them to do their worst, worse than
against Job. Now was that scripture fulfilled ([Job
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#011).md), God hath turned me over into
the hands of the wicked; and no angel is sent from heaven to deliver
him, no friend on earth raised up to appear for him. Secondly, He
withdrew from him the present comfortable sense of his complacency in
him. When his soul was first troubled, he had a voice from heaven to
comfort him ([Joh 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#027.md), [Joh
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#028).md); when he was in his agony in
the garden, there appeared an angel from heaven strengthening him; but
now he had neither the one nor the other. God hid his face from him, and
for awhile withdrew his rod and staff in the darksome valley. God
forsook him, not as he forsook Saul, leaving him to an endless despair,
but as sometimes he forsook David, leaving him to a present despondency.
Thirdly, He let out upon his soul an afflicting sense of his wrath
against man for sin. Christ was made Sin for us, a Curse for us; and
therefore, though God loved him as a Son, he frowned upon him as a
Surety. These impressions he was pleased to admit, and to waive that
resistance of them which he could have made; because he would
accommodate himself to this part of his undertaking, as he had done to
all the rest, when it was in his power to have avoided it.

\[2.\] That Christ's being forsaken of his Father was the most grievous
of his sufferings, and that which he complained most of. Here he laid
the most doleful accents; he did not say, "Why am I scourged? And why
spit upon? And why nailed to the cross?" Nor did he say to his
disciples, when they turned their back upon him, Why have ye forsaken
me? But when his Father stood at a distance, he cried out thus; for this
as it that put wormwood and gall into the affliction and misery. This
brought the waters into the soul, [Psa
69:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001.md).

\[3.\] That our Lord Jesus, even when he was thus forsaken of his
Father, kept hold of him as his God, notwithstanding; My God, my God;
though forsaking me, yet mine. Christ was God's servant in carrying on
the work of redemption, to him he was to make satisfaction, and by him
to be carried through and crowned, and upon that account he calls him
his God; for he was now doing his will. See [Isa
49:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#005.md). This supported him, and bore
him up, that even in the depth of his sufferings God was his God, and
this he resolves to keep fast hold of.

(4.) See how his enemies impiously bantered and ridiculed this complaint
([Mat 27:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#047).md); They said, This man
calleth for Elias. Some think that this was the ignorant mistake of the
Roman soldiers, who had heard talk of Elias, and of the Jews'
expectation of the coming of Elias, but knew not the signification of
Eli, Eli, and so made this blundering comment upon these words of
Christ, perhaps not hearing the latter part of what he said, for the
noise of the people. Note, Many of the reproaches cast upon the word of
God and the people of God, take rise from gross mistakes. Divine truths
are often corrupted by ignorance of the language and style of the
scripture. Those that hear by the halves, pervert what they hear. But
others think that it was the wilful mistake of some of the Jews, who
knew very well what he said, but were disposed to abuse him, and make
themselves and their companions merry, and to misrepresent him as one
who, being forsaken of God, was driven to trust in creatures; perhaps
hinting also, that he who had pretended to be himself the Messiah, would
now be glad to be beholden to Elias, who was expected to be only the
harbinger and forerunner of the Messiah. Note, It is no new thing for
the most pious devotions of the best men to be ridiculed and abused by
profane scoffers; nor are we to think it strange if what is well said in
praying and preaching be misconstrued, and turned to our reproach;
Christ's words were so, though he spoke as never man spoke.

IV\. The cold comfort which his enemies ministered to him in this agony,
which was like all the rest.

1\. Some gave him vinegar to drink ([Mat
27:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#048).md); instead of some cordial-water
to revive and refresh him under this heavy burthen, they tantalized him
with that which did not only add to the reproach they were loading him
with, but did too sensibly represent that cup of trembling which his
Father had put into his hand. One of them ran to fetch it, seeming to be
officious to him, but really glad of an opportunity to abuse and affront
him, and afraid lest any one should take it out of his hands.

2\. Others, which the same purpose of disturbing and abusing him, refer
him to Elias ([Mat 27:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#049).md); "Let be,
let us see whether Elias will come to save him. Come, let him alone, his
case is desperate, neither heaven nor earth can help him; let us do
nothing either to hasten his death, or to retard it; he has appealed to
Elias, and to Elias let him go."

[Matthew 27:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">mat 27:50</span></span>

We have here, at length, an account of the death of Christ, and several
remarkable passages that attended it.

I. The manner how he breathed his last ([Mat
27:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#050).md); between the third and the
sixth hour, that is, between nine and twelve o'clock, as we reckon, he
was nailed to the cross, and soon after the ninth hour, that is, between
three and four o'clock in the afternoon, he died. That was the time of
the offering of the evening sacrifice, and the time when the paschal
lamb was killed; and Christ our Passover was sacrificed for us and
offered himself in the evening of the world a sacrifice to God of a
sweet-smelling savour. It was at that time of the day, that the angel
Gabriel delivered to Daniel that glorious prediction of the Messiah,
[Dan 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021.md), [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md), etc. And some think that from
that very time when the angel spoke it, to this time when Christ died,
was just seventy weeks, that is, four hundred and ninety years to a day,
to an hour; as the departure of Israel out of Egypt was at the end of
the four hundred and thirty years, even the self-same day, [Exo
12:41](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#041.md).

Two things are here noted concerning the manner of Christ's dying.

1\. That he cried with a loud voice, as before, [Mat
27:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#046.md). Now,

(1.) This was a sign, that, after all his pains and fatigues, his life
was whole in him, and nature strong. The voice of dying men is one of
the first things that fails; with a panting breath and a faltering
tongue, a few broken words are hardly spoken, and more hardly heard. But
Christ, just before he expired, spoke like a man in his full strength,
to show that his life was not forced from him, but was freely delivered
by him into his Father's hands, as his own act and deed. He that had
strength to cry thus when he died, could have got loose from the arrest
he was under, and have bid defiance to the powers of death; but to show
that by the eternal Spirit he offered himself, being the Priest as well
as the Sacrifice, he cried with a loud voice.

(2.) It was significant. This loud voice shows that he attacked our
spiritual enemies with an undaunted courage, and such a bravery of
resolution as bespeaks him hearty in the cause and daring in the
encounter. He was now spoiling principalities and powers, and in this
loud voice he did, as it were, shout for mastery, as one mighty to save,
[Isa 63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md). Compare with this, [Isa
42:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#013.md), [Isa
42:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#014.md). He now bowed himself with all
his might, as Samson did, when he said, Let me die with the Philistines,
[Jdg 16:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#030.md). Animamque in vulnere ponit
- And lays down his life. His crying with a loud voice when he died,
signified that his death should be published and proclaimed to all the
world; all mankind being concerned in it, and obliged to take notice of
it. Christ's loud cry was like a trumpet blown over the sacrifices.

2\. That then he yielded up the ghost. This is the usual periphrasis of
dying; to show that the Son of God upon the cross did truly and properly
die by the violence of the pain he was put to. His soul was separated
from his body, and so his body was left really and truly dead. It was
certain that he did die, for it was requisite that he should die; thus
it was written, both in the close rolls of the divine counsels, and in
the letters patent of the divine predictions, and therefore thus it
behoved him to suffer. Death being the penalty for the breach of the
first covenant (Thou shalt surely die), the Mediator of the new covenant
must make atonement by means of death, otherwise no remission, [Heb
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015.md). He had undertaken to make his
soul an offering for sin; and he did it, when he yielded up the ghost,
and voluntarily resigned it.

II\. The miracles that attended his death. So many miracles being
wrought by him in his life, we might well expect some to be wrought
concerning him at his death, for his name was called Wonderful. Had he
been fetched away as Elijah in a fiery chariot, that had itself been
miracle enough; but, being sent for away by an ignominious cross, it was
requisite that his humiliation should be attended with some signal
emanations of the divine glory.

1\. Behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain. This relation is
ushered in with Behold; "Turn aside, and see this great sight, and be
astonished at it." Just as our Lord Jesus expired, at the time of the
offering of the evening-sacrifice, and upon a solemn day, when the
priests were officiating in the temple, and might themselves be
eyewitnesses of it, the veil of the temple was rent by an invisible
power; that veil which parted between the holy place and the most holy.
They had condemned him for saying, I will destroy this temple,
understanding it literally; now by this specimen of his power he let
them know that, if he had pleased, he could have made his words good. In
this, as in others of Christ's miracles, there was a mystery.

(1.) It was in correspondence with the temple of Christ's body, which
was now in the dissolving. This was the true temple, in which dwelt the
fulness of the Godhead; when Christ cried with a loud voice, and gave up
the ghost, and so dissolved that temple, the literal temple did, as it
were, echo to that cry, and answer the stroke, by rending its veil.
Note, Death is the rending of the veil of flesh which interposes between
us and the holy of holies; the death of Christ was so, the death of true
Christians is so.

(2.) It signified the revealing and unfolding of the mysteries of the
Old Testament. The veil of the temple was for concealment, as was that
on the face of Moses, therefore it was called the veil of the covering;
for it was highly penal for any person to see the furniture of the most
holy place, except the High-Priest, and he but once a year, with great
ceremony and through a cloud of smoke; all which signified the darkness
of that dispensation; [Co2 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#013.md). But
now, at the death of Christ, all was laid open, the mysteries were
unveiled, so that now he that runs may read the meaning of them. Now we
see that the mercy-seat signified Christ the great Propitiation; the pot
of manna signified Christ the Break of life. Thus we all with open face
behold, as in a glass (which helps the sight, as the veil hindered it),
the glory of the Lord. Our eyes see the salvation.

(3.) It signified the uniting of Jew and Gentile, by the removing of the
partition wall between them, which was the ceremonial law, by which the
Jews were distinguished from all other people (as a garden enclosed),
were brought near to God, while others were made to keep their distance.
Christ, in his death, repealed the ceremonial law, cancelled that
hand-writing of ordinances, took it out of the way, nailed it to his
cross, and so broke down the middle wall of partition; and by abolishing
those institutions abolished the enmity, and made in himself of twain
one new man (as two rooms are made one, and that large and lightsome, by
taking down the partition), so making peace, [Eph
2:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014.md). Christ died, to rend all
dividing veils, and to make all his one, [Joh
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021.md).

(4.) It signified the consecrating and laying open of a new and living
way to God. The veil kept people off from drawing near to the most holy
place, where the Shechinah was. But the rending of it signified that
Christ by his death opened a way to God, \[1.\] For himself. This was
the great day of atonement, when our Lord Jesus, as the great
High-Priest, not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood,
entered once for all into the holy place; in token of which the veil was
rent, [Heb 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#007.md), etc. Having offered
his sacrifice in the outer court, the blood of it was now to be
sprinkled upon the mercy-seat within the veil; wherefore lift up your
heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; for the King
of glory, the Priest of glory, shall come in. Now was he caused to draw
near, and made to approach, [Jer
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#021.md). Though he did not personally
ascend into the holy place not made with hands till above forty days
after, yet he immediately acquired a right to enter, and had a virtual
admission. \[2.\] For us in him: so the apostle applies it, [Heb
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019.md), [Heb
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#020.md). We have boldness to enter into
the holiest, by that new and living way which he has consecrated for us
through the veil. He died, to bring us to God, and, in order thereunto,
to rend that veil of guilt and wrath which interposed between us and
him, to take away the cherubim and flaming sword, and to open the way to
the tree of life. We have free access through Christ to the throne of
grace, or mercy-seat, now, and to the throne of glory hereafter, [Heb
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#016.md); [Heb
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#020.md). The rending of the veil
signified (as that ancient hymn excellently expresses it), that, when
Christ had overcome the sharpness of death, he opened the kingdom of
heaven to all believers. Nothing can obstruct or discourage our access
to heaven, for the veil is rent; a door is opened in heaven, [Rev
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#001.md).

2\. The earth did quake; not only mount Calvary, where Christ was
crucified, but the whole land, and the adjacent countries. This
earthquake signified two things.

(1.) The horrible wickedness of Christ's crucifiers. The earth, by
trembling under such a load, bore its testimony to the innocency of him
that was persecuted, and against the impiety of those that persecuted
him. Never did the whole creation, before, groan under such a burthen as
the Son of God crucified, and the guilty wretches that crucified him.
The earth quaked, as if it feared to open its mouth to receive the blood
of Christ, so much more precious than that of Abel, which it had
received, and was cursed for it ([Gen
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#011.md), [Gen
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#012).md); and as if it fain would open
its mouth, to swallow up those rebels that put him to death, as it had
swallowed up Dathan and Abiram for a much less crime. When the prophet
would express God's great displeasure against the wickedness of the
wicked, he asks, Shall not the land tremble for this? [Amo
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#008.md).

(2.) The glorious achievements of Christ's cross. This earthquake
signified the mighty shock, nay, the fatal blow, now given to the
devil's kingdom. So vigorous was the assault Christ now made upon the
infernal powers, that (as of old, when he went out of Seir, when he
marched through the field of Edom) the earth trembled, [Jdg
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#004.md); [Psa
68:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#007.md), [Psa
68:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#008.md). God shakes all nations, when the
Desire of all nations is to come; and there is a yet once more, which
perhaps refers to this shaking, [Hag
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006.md), [Hag
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#021.md).

3\. The rocks rent; the hardest and firmest part of the earth was made
to feel this mighty shock. Christ had said, that if the children should
cease to cry Hosanna, the stones would immediately cry out; and now, in
effect, they did so, proclaiming the glory of the suffering Jesus, and
themselves more sensible of the wrong done him than the hard-hearted
Jews were, who yet will shortly be glad to find a hole in the rocks, and
a cleft in the ragged rocks, to hide them from the face of him that
sitteth on the throne. See [Rev 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#016.md);
[Isa 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#021.md). But when God's fury is
poured out like fire, the rocks are thrown down by him, [Nah
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#006.md). Jesus Christ is the Rock; and the
rending of these rocks, signified the rending of that rock, (1.) That in
the clefts of it was may be hid, as Moses in the cleft of the rock at
Horeb, that there we may behold the glory of the Lord, as he did, [Exo
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#022.md). Christ's dove is said to be hid
in the clefts of the rock ([Sol 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014).md),
that is, as some make the allusion, sheltered in the wounds of our Lord
Jesus, the Rock rent. (2.) That from the cleft of it rivers of living
water may flow, and follow us in this wilderness, as from the rock which
Moses smote ([Exo 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006).md), and which God
clave ([Psa 78:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#015).md); and that rock was
Christ, [Co1 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004.md). When we celebrate
the memorial of Christ's death, our hard and rocky hearts must be rent -
the heart, and not the garments. That heart is harder than a rock, that
will not yield, that will not melt, where Jesus Christ is evidently set
forth crucified.

4\. The graves were opened. This matter is not related so fully as our
curiosity would wish; for the scripture was not intended to gratify
that; it should seem, that same earthquake that rent the rocks, opened
the graves, and many bodies of saints which slept, arose. Death to the
saints is but the sleep of the body, and the grave the bed it sleeps in;
they awoke by the power of the Lord Jesus, and ([Mat
27:53](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#053).md) came out of the graves after
his resurrection, and went into Jerusalem, the holy city, and appeared
unto many. Now here,

(1.) We may raise many enquiries concerning it, which we cannot resolve:
as, \[1.\] Who these saints were, that did arise. Some think, the
ancient patriarchs, that were in such care to be buried in the land of
Canaan, perhaps in the believing foresight of the advantage of this
early resurrection. Christ had lately proved the doctrine of the
resurrection from the instance of the patriarchs ([Mat
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#032).md), and here was a speedy
confirmation of his argument. Others think, these that arose were modern
saints, such as had been Christ in the flesh, but died before him; as
his father Joseph, Zecharias, Simeon, John Baptist, and others, that had
been known to the disciples, while they lived, and therefore were the
fitter to be witnesses to them in an apparition after. What if we should
suppose that they were the martyrs, who in the Old Testament times had
sealed the truths of God with their blood, that were thus dignified and
distinguished? Christ particularly points at them as his forerunners,
[Mat 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035.md). And we find ([Rev
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004.md), [Rev
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#005).md), that those who were beheaded
for the testimony of Jesus, arose before the rest of the dead. Sufferers
with Christ shall first reign with him. \[2.\] It is uncertain whether
(as some think) they arose to life, now at the death of Christ, and
disposed of themselves elsewhere, but did not go into the city till
after his resurrection; or whether (as others think), though their
sepulchres (which the Pharisees had built and varnished, [Mat
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#029).md), and so made remarkable, were
shattered now by the earthquake (so little did God regard that
hypocritical respect), yet they did not revive and rise till after the
resurrection; only, for brevity-sake, it is mentioned here, upon the
mention of the opening of the graves, which seems more probable. \[3.\]
Some think that they arose only to bear witness of Christ's resurrection
to those to whom they appeared, and, having finished their testimony,
retired to their graves again. But it is more agreeable, both to
Christ's honour and theirs, to suppose, though we cannot prove, that
they arose as Christ did, to die no more, and therefore ascended with
him to glory. Surely on them who did partake of his first resurrection,
a second death had no power. \[4.\] To whom they appeared (not to all
the people it is certain, but to many), whether enemies or friends, in
what manner they appeared, how often, what they said and did, and how
they disappeared, are secret things which belong not to us; we must not
covet to be wise above what is written. The relating of this matter so
briefly, is a plain intimation to us, that we must not look that way for
a confirmation of our faith; we have a more sure word of prophecy. See
[Luk 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#031.md).

(2.) Yet we may learn many good lessons from it. \[1.\] That even those
who lived and died before the death and resurrection of Christ, had
saving benefit thereby, as well as those who have lived since; for he
was the same yesterday that he is today, and will be for ever, [Heb
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#008.md). \[2.\] That Jesus Christ, by
dying, conquered, disarmed, and disabled, death. These saints that
arose, were the present trophies of the victory of Christ's cross over
the powers of death, which he thus made a show of openly. Having by
death destroyed him that had the power of death, he thus led captivity
captive, and gloried in these re-taken prizes, in them fulfilling that
scripture, I will ransom them from the power of the grave. \[3.\] That,
in virtue of Christ's resurrection, the bodies of all the saints shall,
in the fulness of time, rise again. This was an earnest of the general
resurrection at the last day, when all that are in the graves shall hear
the voice of the Son of God. And perhaps Jerusalem is therefore called
here the holy city, because the saints, at the general resurrection,
shall enter into the new Jerusalem; which will be indeed what the other
was in name and type only, the holy city, [Rev
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002.md). \[4.\] That all the saints do,
by the influence of Christ's death, and in conformity to it, rise from
the death of sin to the life of righteousness. They are raised up with
him to a divine and spiritual life; they go into the holy city, become
citizens of it, have their conversation in it, and appear to many, as
persons not of this world.

III\. The conviction of his enemies that were employed in the execution
([Mat 27:54](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#054).md), which some make no less
than another miracle, all things considered. Observe,

1\. The persons convinced; the centurion, and they that were with him
watching Jesus; a captain and his company, that were set on the guard on
this occasion. (1.) They were soldiers, whose profession is commonly
hardening, and whose breasts are commonly not so susceptible as some
others of the impressions either of fear or pity. But there is no spirit
too big, too bold, for the power of Christ to break and humble. (2.)
They ware Romans, Gentiles, who knew not the scriptures which were now
fulfilled; yet they only were convinced. A sad presage of the blindness
that should happen to Israel, when the gospel should be sent to the
Gentiles, to open their eyes. Here were the Gentiles softened, and the
Jews hardened. (3.) They were the persecutors of Christ, and those that
but just before had reviled him, as appears [Luk
23:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#036.md). How soon can God, by the power
he has over men's consciences, alter their language, and fetch
confessions of his truths, to his own glory, out of the mouths of those
that have breathed nothing but threatenings, and slaughter, and
blasphemies!

2\. The means of their conviction; they perceived the earthquake, which
frightened them, and saw the other things that were done. These were
designed to assert the honour of Christ in his sufferings, and had their
end on these soldiers, whatever they had on others. Note, The dreadful
appearances of God in his providence sometimes work strangely for the
conviction and awakening of sinners.

3\. The expressions of this conviction, in two things.

(1.) The terror that was struck upon them; they feared greatly; feared
lest they should have been buried in the darkness, or swallowed up in
the earthquake. Note, God can easily frighten the most daring of his
adversaries, and make them know themselves to be but men. Guilt puts men
into fear. He that, when iniquity abounds, doth not fear always, with a
fear of caution, when judgments are abroad, cannot but fear greatly,
with a fear of amazement; whereas there are those who will not fear,
though the earth be removed, [Psa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001.md), [Psa
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#002.md).

(2.) The testimony that was extorted from them; they said, Truly this
was the Son of God; a noble confession; Peter was blessed for it, [Mat
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#016.md), [Mat
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#017.md). It was the great matter now in
dispute, the point upon which he and his enemies had joined issue, [Mat
26:63](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#063.md), [Mat
26:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064.md). His disciples believed it, but
at this time durst not confess it; our Saviour himself was tempted to
question it, when he said, Why hast thou forsaken me? The Jews, now that
he was dying upon the cross, looked upon it as plainly determined
against him, that he was not the Son of God, because he did not come
down from the cross. And yet now this centurion and the soldiers make
this voluntary confession of the Christian faith, Truly this was the Son
of God. The best of his disciples could not have said more at any time,
and at this time they had not faith and courage enough to say thus much.
Note, God can maintain and assert the honour of a truth then when it
seems to be crushed, and run down; for great is the truth, and will
prevail.

IV\. The attendance of his friends, that were witnesses of his death,
[Mat 27:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#055.md), [Mat
27:56](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#056.md). Observe,

1\. Who they were; many women who followed him from Galilee. Not his
apostles (only elsewhere we find John by the cross, [Joh
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#026).md), their hearts failed them, they
durst not appear, for fear of coming under the same condemnation. But
here were a company of women, some would have called them silly women,
that boldly stuck to Christ, when the rest of his disciples had basely
deserted him. Note, Even those of the weaker sex are often, by the grace
of God, made strong in faith, that Christ's strength may be made perfect
in weakness. There have been women martyrs, famous for courage and
resolution in Christ's cause. Now of these women it is said, (1.) That
they had followed Jesus from Galilee, out of the great love they had to
him, and a desire to hear him preach; otherwise, the males only were
obliged to come up, to worship at the feast. Now having followed him
such a long journey as from Galilee to Jerusalem, eighty or a hundred
miles, they resolved not to forsake him now. Note, Our former services
and sufferings for Christ should be an argument with us, faithfully to
persevere to the end in our attendance on him. Have we followed him so
far and so long, done so much, and laid out so much for him, and shall
we forsake him now? [Gal 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#003.md), [Gal
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#004). (2..md) That they ministered to him
of their substance, for his necessary subsistence. How gladly would they
have ministered to him now, if they might have been admitted! But, being
forbidden that, they resolved to follow him. Note, When we are
restrained from doing what we would, we must do what we can, in the
service of Christ. Now that he is in heaven, though he is out of the
reach of our ministration, he is not out of the reach of our believing
views. (3.) Some of them are particularly named; for God will honour
those that honour Christ. They were such as we have several times met
with before, and it was their praise, that we meet with them to the
last.

2\. What they did; they were beholding afar off.

(1.) They stood afar off. Whether their own fear or their enemies' fury
kept them at a distance, is not certain; however, it was an aggravation
of the sufferings of Christ, that his lovers and friends stood aloof
from his sore, [Psa 38:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#011.md); [Job
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#013.md). Perhaps they might have come
nearer, if they would; but good people, when they are in sufferings,
must not think it strange, if some of their best friends be shy of them.
When Paul's danger was imminent, no man stood by him, [Ti2
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#016.md). If we be thus looked strangely
upon, remember, our Master was so before us.

(2.) They were there beholding, in which they showed a concern and
kindness for Christ; when they were debarred from doing any other office
of love to him, they looked a look of love toward him. \[1.\] It was a
sorrowful look; they looked unto him who was now pierced, and mourned;
and no doubt, were in bitterness for him. We may well imagine how it cut
them to the heart, to see him in this torment; and what floods of tears
it fetched from their eyes. Let us with an eye of faith behold Christ
and him crucified, and be affected with that great love wherewith he
loved us. But, \[2.\] It was no more than a look; they beheld him, but
they could not help him. Note, When Christ was in his sufferings, the
best of his friends were but spectators and lookers on, even the angelic
guards stood trembling by, saith Mr. Norris, for he trod the wine-press
alone, and of the people there was none with him; so his own arm wrought
salvation.

[Matthew 27:57](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">mat 27:57</span></span>

We have here an account of Christ's burial, and the manner and
circumstances of it, concerning which observe, 1. The kindness and good
will of his friends that laid him in the grave. 2. The malice and ill
will of his enemies that were very solicitous to keep him there.

I. His friends gave him a decent burial. Observe,

1\. In general, that Jesus Christ was buried; when his precious soul was
gone to paradise, his blessed body was deposited in the chambers of the
grave, that he might answer the type of Jonas, and fulfil the prophecy
of Isaias; he made his grave with the wicked. Thus in all things he must
be made like unto his brethren, sin only excepted, and, like us, unto
dust he must return. He was buried, to make his death the more certain,
and his resurrection the more illustrious. Pilate would not deliver his
body to be buried, till he was well assured that he was really dead;
while the witnesses lay unburied, there were some hopes concerning them,
[Rev 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008.md). But Christ, the great
Witness, is as one free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the
grave. He was buried, that he might take off the terror of the grave,
and make it easy to us, might warm and perfume that cold noisome bed for
us, and that we might be buried with him.

2\. The particular circumstances of his burial here related.

(1.) The time when he was buried; when the evening was come; the same
evening that he died, before sun-set, as is usual in burying
malefactors. It was not deferred till the next day, because it was the
sabbath; for burying the dead is not proper work either for a day of
rest or for a day of rejoicing, as the sabbath is.

(2.) The person that took care of the funeral was Joseph of Arimathea.
The apostles had all fled, and none of them appeared to show this
respect to their Master, which the disciples of John showed to him after
he was beheaded, who took up his body, and buried it, [Joh
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#012.md). The women that followed him
durst not move in it; then did God stir up this good man to do it; for
what work God has to do, he will find out instruments to do it. Joseph
was a fit man, for, \[1.\] He had wherewithal to do it, being a rich
man. Most of Christ's disciples were poor men, such were most fit to go
about the country to preach the gospel; but here was one that was a rich
man, ready to be employed in a piece of service which required a man of
estate. Note, Worldly wealth, though it is to many an objection in
religion's way, yet, in some services to be done for Christ, it is an
advantage and an opportunity, and it is well for those who have it, if
withal they have a heart to use it for God's glory. \[2.\] He was well
affected to our Lord Jesus, for he was himself his disciple, believed in
him, though he did not openly profess it. Note, Christ has more secret
disciples than we are aware of; seven thousand in Israel, [Rom
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#004.md).

(3.) The grant of the dead body procured from Pilate, [Mat
27:58](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#058.md). Joseph went to Pilate, the
proper person to be applied to on this occasion, who had the disposal of
the body; for in things wherein the power of the magistrate is
concerned, due regard must be had to that power, and nothing done to
break in upon it. What we do that is good, must be done peaceably, and
not tumultuously. Pilate was willing to give the body to one that would
inter it decently, that he might do something towards atoning for the
guilt his conscience charged him with in condemning an innocent person.
In Joseph's petition, and Pilate's ready grant of it, honour was done to
Christ, and a testimony borne to his integrity.

(4.) The dressing of the body in its grave-clothes ([Mat
27:59](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#059).md); though he was an honourable
counsellor, yet he himself took the body, as it should seem, into his
own arms, from the infamous and accursed tree ([Act
13:29](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#029).md); for where there is true love
to Christ, no service will be thought too mean to stoop to for him.
Having taken it, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth; for burying in
linen was then the common usage, which Joseph complied with. Note, Care
is to be taken of the dead bodies of good men, for there is a glory
intended for them at the resurrection, which we must hereby testify our
belief of, and wind up the dead body as designed for a better place.
This common act of humanity, if done after a godly sort, may be made an
acceptable piece of Christianity.

(5.) The depositing of it in the sepulchre, [Mat
27:60](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#060.md). Here there was nothing of that
pomp and solemnity with which the grandees of the world are brought to
the grave, and laid in the tomb, [Job
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#032.md). A private funeral did best
befit him whose kingdom came not with observation.

\[1.\] He was laid in a borrowed tomb, in Joseph's burying place; as he
had not a house of his own, wherein to lay his head while he lived, so
he had not a grave of his own, wherein to lay his body when he was dead,
which was an instance of his poverty; yet in this there might be
somewhat of a mystery. The grave is the peculiar heritage of a sinner,
[Job 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#019.md). There is nothing we can
truly call our own but our sins and our graves; he returneth to his
earth, [Psa 146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004.md). When we go to the
grave, we go to our own place; but our Lord Jesus, who had no sin of his
own, had no grave of his own; dying under imputed sin, it was fit that
he should be buried in a borrowed grave; the Jews designed that he
should have made his grave with the wicked, should have been buried with
the thieves with whom he was crucified, but God over-ruled it, so as
that he should make it with the rich in his death, [Isa
53:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009.md).

\[2.\] He was laid in a new tomb, which Joseph, it is likely, designed
for himself; it would, however, be never the worse for his lying in it,
who was to rise so quickly, but a great deal the better for his lying in
it, who has altered the property of the grave, and made it anew indeed,
by turning it into a bed of rest, nay into a bed of spices, for all the
saints.

\[3.\] In a tomb that was hewn out of a rock; the ground about Jerusalem
was generally rocky. Shebna had his sepulchre hewn out thereabouts in a
rock, [Isa 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#016.md). Providence ordered
it that Christ's sepulchre should be in a solid entire rock, that no
room might be left to suspect his disciples had access to it by some
underground passage, or broke through the back wall of it, to steal the
body; for there was no access to it but by the door, which was watched.

\[4.\] A great stone was rolled to the door of his sepulchre; this also
was according to the custom of the Jews in burying their dead, as
appears by the description of the grave of Lazarus ([Joh
11:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#038).md), signifying that those who are
dead, are separated and cut off from all the living; if the grave were
his prison, now was the prison-door locked and bolted. The rolling of
the stone to the grave's mouth, was with them as filling up the grave is
with us, it completed the funeral. Having thus in silence and sorrow
deposited the previous body of our Lord Jesus in the grave, the house
appointed for all living, they departed without any further ceremony. It
is the most melancholy circumstance in the funerals of our Christian
friends, when we have laid their bodies in the dark and silent grave, to
go home, and leave them behind; but alas, it is not we that go home, and
leave them behind, no, it is they that are gone to the better home, and
have left us behind.

(6.) The company that attended the funeral; and that was very small and
mean. Here were none of the relations in mourning, to follow the corpse,
no formalities to grace the solemnity, but some good women that were
true mourners - Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, [Mat
27:56](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#056.md). These, as they had attended him
to the cross, so they followed him to the grave; as if they composed
themselves to sorrow, they sat over against the sepulchre, not so much
to fill their eyes with the sight of what was done, as to empty them in
rivers of tears. Note, True love to Christ will carry us through, to the
utmost, in following him. Death itself cannot quench that divine fire,
[Sol 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006.md), [Sol
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#007.md).

II\. His enemies did what they could to prevent his resurrection; what
they did herein was the next day that followed the day of the
preparation, [Mat 27:62](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#062.md). That was the
seventh day of the week, the Jewish sabbath, yet not expressly called
so, but described by this periphrasis, because it was now shortly to
give way to the Christian sabbath, which began the day after. Now, 1.
All that day, Christ lay dead in the grave; having for six days laboured
and done all his work, on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.
2. On that day, the chief priests and Pharisees, when they should have
been at their devotions, asking pardon for the sins of the week past,
were dealing with Pilate about securing the sepulchre, and so adding
rebellion to their sin. They that had so often quarrelled with Christ
for works of the greatest mercy on that day, were themselves busied in a
work of the greatest malice. Observe here,

(1.) Their address to Pilate; they were vexed that the body was given to
one that would bury it decently; but, since it must be so, they desire a
guard may be set on the sepulchre.

\[1.\] Their petition sets forth, that that deceiver (so they call him
who is truth itself) had said, After three days I will rise again. He
had said so, and his disciples remembered those very words for the
confirmation of their faith, but his persecutors remember them for the
provocation of their rage and malice. Thus the same word of Christ to
the one was a savour of life unto life, to the other of death unto
death. See how they compliment Pilate with the title of Sir, while they
reproach Christ with the title of Deceiver. Thus the most malicious
slanderers of good men are commonly the most sordid flatterers of great
men.

\[2.\] It further sets forth their jealousy; lest his disciples come by
night, and steal him away, and say, He is risen.

First, That which really they were afraid of, was, his resurrection;
that which is most Christ's honour and his people's joy, is most the
terror of his enemies. That which exasperated Joseph's brethren against
him, was the presage of his rise, and of his having dominion over them
([Gen 37:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#008).md); and all they aimed at, in
what they did against him, was, to prevent that. Come, say they, let us
slay him, and see what will become of his dreams. So the chief priests
and Pharisees laboured to defeat the predictions of Christ's
resurrection, saying, as David's enemies of him ([Psa
41:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#008).md), Now that he lieth, he shall
rise up no more; if he should rise, that would break all their measures.
Note, Christ's enemies, even when they have gained their point, are
still in fear of losing it again. Perhaps the priests were surprised at
the respect shown to Christ's dead body by Joseph and Nicodemus, two
honourable counsellors, and looked upon it as an ill presage; nor can
they forget his raising Lazarus from the dead, which so confounded them.

Secondly, That which they took on them to be afraid of, was, lest his
disciples should come by night, and steal him away, which was a very
improbable thing; for, 1. They had not the courage to own him while he
lived, when they might have done him and themselves real service; and it
was not likely that his death should put courage into such cowards. 2.
What could they promise themselves by stealing away his body, and making
people believe he was risen; when, if he should not rise, and so prove
himself a deceiver, his disciples, who had left all for him in this
world, in dependence upon a recompence in the other world, would of all
others suffer most by the imposture, and would have had reason to throw
the first stone at his name? What good would it do them, to carry on a
cheat upon themselves, to steal away his body, and say, He is risen;
when, if he were not risen, their faith was vain, and they were of all
men the most miserable? The chief priests apprehend that if the doctrine
of Christ's resurrection be once preached and believed, the last error
will be worse than the first; a proverbial expression, intimating no
more than this, that we shall all be routed, all undone. They think it
was their error, that they had so long connived at his preaching and
miracles, which error they thought they had rectified by putting him to
death; but if people should be persuaded of his resurrection, that would
spoil all again, his interest would revive with him, and theirs must
needs sink, who had so barbarously murdered him. Note, Those that
opposed Christ and his kingdom, will see not only their attempts
baffled, but themselves miserably plunged and embarrassed, their errors
each worse than other, and the last worst of all, [Psa
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004.md), [Psa
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005.md).

\[3.\] In consideration hereof, they humbly move to have a guard set
upon the sepulchre till the third day; Command that the sepulchre be
made sure. Pilate must still be their drudge, his civil and military
power must both be engaged to serve their malice; one would think that
death's prisoners needed no other guard, and that the grave were
security enough to itself; but what will not those fear, who are
conscious to themselves both of guilt and impotency, in opposing the
Lord and his anointed?

(2.) Pilate's answer to this address ([Mat
27:65](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#065).md); He have a watch, make it sure,
as sure as you can. He was ready to gratify Christ's friends, in
allowing them the body, and his enemies, in setting a guard upon it,
being desirous to please all sides, while perhaps he laughed in his
sleeve at both for making such ado, pro and con, about the dead body of
a man, looking upon the hopes of one side and the fears of the other to
be alike ridiculous. Ye have a watch; he means the constant guard that
was kept in the tower of Antonia, out of which the allows them to detach
as many as they pleased for that purpose, but, as if ashamed to be
himself seen in such a thing, he leaves the management of it wholly to
them. Methinks that word, Make it as sure as you can, looks like a
banter, either, \[1.\] Of their fears; "Be sure to set a strong guard
upon the dead man;" or rather, \[2.\] Of their hopes; "Do your worst,
try your wit and strength to the utmost; but if he be of God, he will
rise, in spite of you and all your guards." I am apt to think, that by
this time Pilate had had some talk with the centurion, his own officer,
of whom he would be apt to enquire how that just man died, whom he had
condemned with such reluctance; and that he gave him such an account of
those things as made him conclude that truly he was the Son of God; and
Pilate would give more credit to him than to a thousand of those
spiteful priests that called him a Deceiver; and if so, no marvel that
he tacitly derides their project, in thinking to secure the sepulchre
upon him who had so lately rent the rocks, and made the earth to quake.
Tertullion, speaking of Pilate, saith, Ipse jam pro su conscienti
Christianus - In his conscience he was a Christian; and it is possible
that he might be under such convictions at this time, upon the
centurion's report, and yet never be thoroughly persuaded, any more than
Agrippa or Felix was, to be a Christian.

(3.) The wonderful care they took, hereupon, to secure the sepulchre
([Mat 27:66](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#066).md); They sealed the stone;
probably with the great seal of their sanhedrim, whereby they interposed
their authority, for who durst break the public seal? But not trusting
too much to that, withal they set a watch, to keep his disciples from
coming to steal him away, and, if possible, to hinder him from coming
out of the grave. So they intended, but God brought this good out of it,
that they who were set to oppose his resurrection, thereby had an
opportunity to observe it, and did so, and told the chief priests what
they observed, who were thereby rendered the more inexcusable. Here was
all the power of earth and hell combined to keep Christ a prisoner, but
all in vain, when his hour was come; death, and all those sons and heirs
of death, could then no longer hold him, no longer have dominion over
him. To guard the sepulchre against the poor weak disciples, was folly,
because needless; but to think to guard it against the power of God was
folly, because fruitless and to no purpose; and yet they thought they
had dealt wisely.
