### [Isaiah Chapter 51](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 51:0</span></span>

This chapter is designed for the comfort and encouragement of those that
fear God and keep his commandments, even when they walk in darkness and
have no light. Whether it was intended primarily for the support of the
captives in Babylon is not certain, probably it was; but comforts thus
generally expressed ought not to be so confined. Whenever the church of
God is in distress her friends and well-wishers may comfort themselves
and one another with these words, I. That God, who raised his church at
first out of nothing, will take care that it shall not perish ([Isa
51:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001).md). II. That the righteousness
and salvation he designs for his church are sure and near, very near and
very sure ([Isa 51:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#004).md). III. That the
persecutors of the church are weak and dying creatures ([Isa
51:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#007.md), [Isa
51:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#008).md). IV. That the same power which
did wonders for the church formerly is now engaged and employed for her
protection and deliverance ([Isa
51:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009).md). V. That God himself, the
Maker of the world, had undertaken both to deliver his people out of
their distress and to comfort them under it, and sent his prophet to
assure them of it ([Isa 51:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#012).md). VI.
That, deplorable as the condition of the church now was ([Isa
51:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017).md), to the same woeful
circumstances her persecutors and oppressors should shortly be reduced,
and worse ([Isa 51:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#021).md). The first
three paragraphs of this chapter begin with, "Hearken unto me," and they
are God's people that are all along called to hearken; for even when
comforts are spoken to them sometimes they "hearken not, through anguish
of spirit" ([Exo 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#009).md); therefore they
are again and again called to hearken ([Isa
51:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001.md), [Isa
51:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#004.md), [Isa
51:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#007).md). The two other paragraphs of
this chapter begin with "Awake, awake;" in the former ([Isa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009).md) God's people call upon him to
awake and help them; in the latter ([Isa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017).md) God calls upon them to awake
and help themselves.

[Isaiah 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 51:1</span></span>

Observe, 1. How the people of God are here described, to whom the word
of this consolation is sent and who are called upon to hearken to it,
[Isa 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001.md). They are such as follow
after righteousness, such as are very desirous and solicitous both to be
justified and to be sanctified, are pressing hard after this, to have
the favour of God restored to them and the image of God renewed on them.
These are those that seek the Lord, for it is only in the say of
righteousness that we can seek him with any hope of finding him. 2. How
they are here directed to look back to their original, and the smallness
of their beginning: "Look unto the rock whence you were hewn" (the
idolatrous family in Ur of the Chaldees, out of which Abraham was taken,
the generation of slaves which the heads and fathers of their tribes
were in Egypt); "look unto the hole of the pit out of which you were
digged, as clay, when God formed you into a people." Note, It is good
for those that are privileged by a new birth to consider what they were
by their first birth, how they were conceived in iniquity and shapen in
sin. That which is born of the flesh is flesh. How hard was that rock
out of which we were hewn, unapt to receive impressions, and how
miserable the hole of that pit out of which we were digged! The
consideration of this should fill us with low thoughts of ourselves and
high thoughts of divine grace. Those that are now advanced would do well
to remember how low they began ([Isa
51:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#002).md): "Look unto Abraham your father,
the father of all the faithful, of all that follow after the
righteousness of faith as he did ([Rom
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#011).md), and unto Sarah that bore you,
and whose daughters you all are as long as you do well. Think how
Abraham was called alone, and yet was blessed and multiplied; and let
that encourage you to depend upon the promise of God even when a
sentence of death seems to be upon all the means that lead to the
performance of it. Particularly let it encourage the captives in
Babylon, though they are reduced to a small number, and few of them
left, to hope that yet they shall increase so as to replenish their own
land again." When Jacob is very small, yet he is not so small as Abraham
was, who yet became father of many nations. "Look unto Abraham, and see
what he got by trusting in the promise of God, and take example by him
to follow God with an implicit faith." 3. How they are here assured that
their present seedness of tears should at length end in a harvest of
joys, [Isa 51:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#003.md). The church of God on
earth, even the gospel Zion, has sometimes had her deserts and waste
places, many parts of the church, through either corruption or
persecution, made like a wilderness, unfruitful to God or uncomfortable
to the inhabitants; but God will find out a time and way to comfort
Zion, not only by speaking comfortably to her, but by acting graciously
for her. God has comforts in store even for the waste places of his
church, for those parts of it that seem not regarded or valued. (1.) He
will make them fruitful, and so give them cause to rejoice; her
wildernesses shall put on a new face, and look pleasant as Eden, and
abound in all good fruits, as the garden of the Lord. Note, It is the
greatest comfort of the church to be made serviceable to the glory of
God, and to be as his garden in which he delights. (2.) He will make
them cheerful, and so give them hearts to rejoice. With the fruits of
righteousness, joy and gladness shall be found therein; for the more
holiness men have, and the more good they do, the more gladness they
have. And where there is gladness, to their satisfaction, it is fit that
there should be thanksgiving, to God's honour; for whatever is the
matter of our rejoicing ought to be the matter of our thanksgiving; and
the returns of God's favour ought to be celebrated with the voice of
melody, which will be the more melodious when God gives songs in the
night, songs in the desert.

[Isaiah 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 51:4</span></span>

Both these proclamations, as I may call them, end alike with an
assurance of the perpetuity of God's righteousness and his salvation;
and therefore we put them together, both being designed for the comfort
of God's people. Observe,

I. Who they are to whom this comfort belongs: "My people, and my nation,
that I have set apart for myself, that own me and are owned by me."
Those are God's people and his nation who are subject to him as their
King and their God, pay allegiance to him, and put themselves under his
protection accordingly. They are a people who know righteousness, who
not only have the means of knowledge, and to whom righteousness is made
known, but who improve those means, and are able to form a right
judgment of truth and falsehood, good and evil. And, as they have good
heads, so they have good hearts, for they have the law of God in them,
written and ruling there. Those God owns for his people in whose hearts
his law is. Even those who know righteousness, and have the law of God
in their hearts, may yet be in great distress and sorrow, and loaded
with reproach and contempt; but their God will comfort them with the
righteousness they know and the law they have in their hearts.

II\. What the comfort is that belongs to God's people. 1. That the
gospel of Christ shall be preached and published to the world: A law
shall proceed from me, an evangelical law, the law of Christ, the law of
faith, [Isa 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003.md). This law is his
judgment; for it is that law of liberty by which the world shall be
governed and judged. This shall not only go forth, but shall continue
and rest, it shall take firm footing and deep root in the world. It
shall rest, not only for the benefit of the Jews, who had the first
notice of it, but for a light of the people of other nations. It is this
law, this judgment, that we are required to hearken and give ear to, at
our peril; for how shall we escape if we neglect it and turn a deaf ear
to it? When a law proceeds from God, he that has ears to hear, let him
hear. 2. That this law and judgment shall bring with them righteousness
and salvation, shall open a ready way to the children of men, that they
may be justified and saved, [Isa 51:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#005.md).
These are called God's righteousness and his salvation, because of his
contriving and bringing them about. The former is a righteousness which
he will accept for us and accept us for, and a righteousness which he
will work in us and graciously accept of. The latter is the salvation of
the Lord, for it arises from him and terminates in him. Observe, There
is no salvation without righteousness; and, wherever there is the
righteousness of God, there shall be his salvation. All those, and those
only, that are justified and sanctified shall be glorified. 3. That this
righteousness and salvation shall very shortly appear: My righteousness
is near. It is near in time; behold, all things are now ready. It is
near in place, not far to seek, but the word is nigh us, and Christ in
the word, righteousness in the word, [Rom
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#008.md). My salvation has gone forth. The
decree has gone forth concerning it; it shall as certainly be introduced
as if it had gone forth already, and the time for it is at hand. 4. That
this evangelical righteousness and salvation shall not be confined to
the Jewish nation, but shall be extended to the Gentiles; My arms shall
judge the people. Those that will not yield to the judgments of God's
mouth shall be crushed by the judgments of his hand. Some shall thus be
judged by the gospel, for for judgment Christ came into this world; but
others, and those of the isles, shall wait upon him, and bid his gospel,
and the commands as well as the comforts of it, welcome. It was a
comfort to God's people, to his nation, that multitudes should be added
to them, and the increase of their number should be the increase of
their strength and beauty. It is added, And on my arm shall they trust,
that arm of the Lord which is revealed in Christ, [Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md). Observe, God's arm shall judge
the people that are impenitent, and yet on his arm shall others trust
and be saved by it; for it is to us as we make it, a savour of life or
of death. 5. That this righteousness and salvation shall be for ever,
and shall never be abolished, [Isa
51:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#008.md). It is an everlasting
righteousness that the Messiah brings in ([Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024).md), an eternal redemption that he
is the author of, [Heb 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#009.md). As it
shall spread through all the nations of the earth, so it shall last
through all the ages of the world. We must never expect any other way of
salvation, any other covenant of peace or rule of righteousness, than
what we have in the gospel, and what we have there shall continue to the
end, [Mat 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020.md). It is for ever; for
the consequences of it shall be to eternity, and by this law of liberty
men's everlasting state will be determined. This perpetuity of the
gospel and the blessed things it brings in is illustrated by the fading
and perishing of this world and all things in it. Look up to the visible
heavens above, which have continued hitherto, and seem likely to
continue, but they shall vanish like smoke that soon spends itself and
disappears; they shall be rolled like a scroll, and their lights shall
fall like leaves in autumn. Look down to the earth beneath; that abides
too for a short ever ([Ecc 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#004).md), but
it shall wax old like a garment that will be the worse for wearing; and
those that dwell therein, all the inhabitants of the earth, even those
that seem to have the best settlement in it, shall die in like manner:
the soul shall, as to this world, vanish like smoke, and the body be
thrown by like a garment waxen old. They shall be easily crushed ([Job
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#019).md), and no loss of them. But when
heaven and earth pass away, when all flesh and the glory of it wither as
grass, the word of the Lord endures for ever, and not one iota or tittle
of that shall fall to the ground. Those whose happiness is bound up in
Christ's righteousness and salvation will have the comfort of it when
time and days shall be no more.

III\. What use they are to make of this comfort. If God's righteousness
and salvation are near to them, then let them not fear the reproach of
men, of mortal miserable men, nor be afraid of their revilings or
spiteful taunts, theirs who bid you sing them the songs of Zion, or who
ask you, in scorn, Where is now your God? Let not those who embrace the
gospel righteousness be afraid of those who will call them Beelzebub,
and will say all manner of evil against them falsely. Let them not be
afraid of them; let them not be disturbed by these opprobrious speeches,
nor made uneasy by them, as if they would be the ruin of their
reputation and honour and they must for ever lie under the load of them.
Let them not be afraid of their executing their menaces, nor be deterred
thereby from their duty, nor frightened into any sinful compliances, nor
driven to take any indirect courses for their own safety. Those can bear
but little for Christ that cannot bear a hard word for him. Let us not
fear the reproach of men; for, 1. They will be quickly silenced ([Isa
51:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#008).md): The moth shall eat them up like
a garment, [Isa 50:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#009.md). The worm shall
eat them like wool, or woollen cloth. If we have the approbation of a
living God, we may despise the censure of dying men; the matter is not
great what those say of us who must shortly be food for worms. Or it
intimates the judgments of God with which they shall be visited, with
which they shall be consumed, for their malice against the people of
God; they shall be slowly and silently, but effectually destroyed, when
God shall come to reckon with them for all their hard speeches, [Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014.md), [Jde
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#015.md). 2. The cause we suffer for
cannot be run down. The falsehood of their reproaches will be detected,
but truth shall triumph, and the righteousness of religion's injured
cause shall be for ever plain. Clouds darken the sun, but give no
obstruction to his progress.

[Isaiah 51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 51:9</span></span>

In these verses we have,

I. A prayer that God would, in his providence, appear and act for the
deliverance of his people and the mortification of his and their
enemies. Awake, awake! put on strength, O arm of the Lord! [Isa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009.md). The arm of the Lord is Christ,
or it is put for God himself, as [Psa
44:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#023.md). Awake! why sleepest thou? He
that keeps Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps; but, when we pray that he
would awake, we mean that he would make it to appear that he watches
over his people and is always awake to do them good. The arm of the Lord
is said to awake when the power of God exerts itself with more than
ordinary vigour on his people's behalf. When a hand or arm is benumbed
we say, It is asleep; when it is stretched forth for action, It awakes.
God needs not to be reminded nor excited by us, but he gives us leave
thus to be humbly earnest with him for such appearances of his power as
will be for his own praise. "Put on strength," that is, "put forth
strength: appear in thy strength, as we appear in the clothes we put
on," [Psa 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#013.md). The church sees her
case bad, her enemies many and mighty, her friends few and feeble; and
therefore she depends purely upon the strength of God's arm for her
relief. "Awake, as in the ancient days," that is, "do for us now as thou
didst for our fathers formerly, repeat the wonders they told us of,"
[Jdg 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#013.md).

II\. The pleas to enforce this prayer. 1. They plead precedents, the
experiences of their ancestors, and the great things God had done for
them. "Let the arm of the Lord be made bare on our behalf; for it has
done great things formerly in defence of the same cause, and we are sure
it is neither shortened nor weakened. It did wonders against the
Egyptians, who enslaved and oppressed God's son, his first-born; it cut
Rahab to pieces with one direful plague after another, and wounded
Pharaoh, the dragon, the Leviathan (as he is called, [Psa
74:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#013.md), [Psa
74:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#014).md); it gave him his death's wound.
It did wonders for Israel. It dried up the sea, even the waters of the
great deep, as far as was requisite to open a way through the sea for
the ransomed to pass over," [Isa
51:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#010.md). God is never at a loss for a
way to accomplish his purposes concerning his people, but will either
find one or make one. Past experiences, as they are great supports to
faith and hope, so they are good pleas in prayer. Thou hast; wilt thou
not? [Psa 85:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001.md). 2. They plead
promises ([Isa 51:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#011).md): And the
redeemed of the Lord shall return, that is (as it may be supplied), thou
hast said, They shall, referring to [Isa
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#010.md), where we find this promise,
that the redeemed of the Lord, when they are released out of their
captivity in Babylon, shall come with singing unto Zion. Sinners, when
they are brought out of the slavery of sin into the glorious liberty of
God's children, may come singing, as a bird got loose out of the cage.
The souls of believers, when they are delivered out of the prison of the
body, come to the heavenly Zion with singing. Then this promise will
have its full accomplishment, and we may plead it in the mean time. He
that designs such joy for us at last will he not work such deliverances
for us in the mean time as our case requires? When the saints come to
heaven they enter into the joy of their Lord; it crowns their heads with
immortal honour; it fills their hearts with complete satisfaction. They
shall obtain that joy and gladness which they could never obtain in this
vale of tears. In this world of changes it is a short step from joy to
sorrow, but in that world sorrow and mourning shall flee away, never to
return or come in view again.

III\. The answer immediately given to this prayer ([Isa
51:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#012).md): I, even, I, am he that
comforteth you. They prayed for the operations of his power; he answers
them with the consolations of his grace, which may well be accepted as
an equivalent. If God do not wound the dragon, and dry the sea, as
formerly, yet, if he comfort us in soul under our afflictions, we have
no reason to complain. If God do not answer immediately with the saving
strength of his right hand, we must be thankful if he answer us, as an
angel himself was answered ([Zac
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#013).md), with good words and comfortable
words. See how God resolves to comfort his people: I, even I, will do
it. He had ordered his ministers to do it ([Isa
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001).md); but, because they cannot reach
the heart, he takes the work into his own hands: I, even I, will do it.
See how he glories in it; he takes it among the titles of his honour to
be the God that comforts those that are cast down; he delights in being
so. Those whom God comforts are comforted indeed; nay, his undertaking
to comfort them is comfort enough to them.

1\. He comforts those that were in fear; and fear has torment, which
calls for comfort. The fear of man has a snare in it which we have need
of comfort to preserve us from. He comforts the timorous by chiding
them, and that is no improper way of comforting either others or
ourselves: Why art thou cast down, and why disquieted? [Isa
51:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#012.md), [Isa
51:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#013.md). God, who comforts his people,
would not have them disquiet themselves with amazing perplexing fears of
the reproach of men ([Isa 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#007).md), or of
their growing threatening power and greatness, or of any mischief they
may intend against us or our people. Observe,

(1.) The absurdity of those fears. It is a disparagement to us to give
way to them: Who art thou, that thou shouldst be afraid? In the
original, the pronoun is feminine, Who art thou, O woman! unworthy the
name of a man? Such a weak and womanish thing it is to give way to
perplexing fears. \[1.\] It is absurd to be in such dread of a dying
man. What! afraid of a man that shall die, shall certainly and shortly
die, of the son of man who shall be made as grass, shall wither and be
trodden down or eaten up? The greatest men, and the most formidable,
that are the terror of the mighty in the land of the living, are but men
([Psa 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#020).md) and shall die like men
([Psa 81:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#007).md), are but grass sprung out
of the earth, cleaving to it, and retiring again into it. Note, We ought
to look upon every man as a man that shall die. Those we admire, and
love, and trust to, are men that shall die; let us not therefore delight
too much in them nor depend too much upon them. Those we fear we must
look upon as frail and mortal, and consider what a foolish thing it is
for the servants of the living God to be afraid of dying men, that are
here today and gone tomorrow. \[2.\] It is absurd to fear continually
every day ([Isa 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#013).md), to put
ourselves upon a constant rack, so as never to be easy, nor to have any
enjoyment of ourselves. Now and then a danger may be imminent and
threatening, and it may be prudent to fear it; but to be always in a
toss, jealous of dangers at every step, and to tremble at the shaking of
every leaf, is to make ourselves all our lifetime subject to bondage
([Heb 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#015).md), and to bring upon
ourselves that sore judgment which is threatened, [Deu
28:66](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#066.md), [Deu
28:67](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#067.md). Thou shalt fear, day and night.
\[3.\] It is absurd to fear beyond what there is cause: "Thou art afraid
of the fury of the oppressor. It is true, there is an oppressor, and he
is furious, and he designs, it may be, when he has an opportunity, to do
thee a mischief, and it will be thy wisdom therefore to stand upon thy
guard; but thou art afraid of him, as if he were ready to destroy, as if
he were just now going to cut thy throat, and as if there were no
possibility of preventing it." A timorous spirit is thus apt to make the
worst of every thing, and to apprehend the danger greater and nearer
than really it is. Sometimes God is pleased at once to show us the folly
of so doing: "Where is the fury of the oppressor? It is gone in an
instant, and the danger is over ere thou art aware." His heart is
turned, or his hands are tied. Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise, and
the king of Babylon no more. What has become of all the furious
oppressors of God's Israel, that hectored them, and threatened them, and
were a terror to them? they passed away, and, lo, they were not; and so
shall these.

(2.) The impiety of those fears: "Thou art afraid of a man that shall
die, and forgettest the Lord thy Maker, who is also the Maker of all the
world, who has stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of
the earth, and therefore has all the hosts and all the powers of both at
his command and disposal." Note, Our inordinate fear of man is a tacit
forgetfulness of God. When we disquiet ourselves with the fear of man we
forget that there is a God above him, and that the greatest of men have
no power but what is given them from above; we forget the providence of
God, by which he orders and overrules all events according to the
counsel of his own will; we forget the promises he has made to protect
his people, and the experiences we have had of his care concerning us,
and his seasonable interposition for our relief many a time, when we
thought the oppressor ready to destroy; we forget our Jehovah-jirehs,
monuments of mercy in the mount of the Lord. Did we remember to make God
our fear and our dread, we should not be so much afraid as we are of the
frowns of men, [Isa 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#012.md), [Isa
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#013.md). Happy is the man that fears God
always, [Pro 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#014.md); [Luk
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#004.md), [Luk
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#005.md).

2\. He comforts those that were in bonds, [Isa
51:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#014.md), [Isa
51:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#015). See here, (1..md) What they do for
themselves: The captives exile hastens that he may be loosed and may
return to his own country, from which he is banished; his care is that
he may not die in the pit (not die a prisoner, through the
inconveniences of his confinement), and that his bread should not fail,
either the bread he should have to keep him alive in prison or that
which should bear his charges home; his stock is low, and therefore he
hastens to be loosed. Now some understand this as his fault. He is
distrustfully impatient of delays, cannot wait God's time, but thinks he
is undone and must die in the pit if he be not released immediately.
Others take it to be his praise, that when the doors are thrown open he
does not linger, but applies himself with all diligence to procure his
discharge. And then it follows, But I am the Lord thy God, which
intimates, (2.) What God will do for them, even that which they cannot
do for themselves. God has all power in his hand to help the captive
exiles; for he has divided the sea, when the roaring of its waves was
more frightful than any of the impotent menaces of proud oppressors. He
has stilled or quieted the sea, so some think it should be read, [Psa
65:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#007.md); [Psa
89:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#009.md). This is not only a proof of what
God can do, but a resemblance of what he has done, and will do, for his
people; he will find out a way to still the threatening storm, and bring
them safely into the harbour. The Lord of hosts is his name, his name
for ever, the name by which his people have long known him. And, as he
is able to help them, so he is willing and engaged to do it; for he is
thy God, O captive-exile! thine in covenant. This is a check to the
desponding captives. Let them not conclude that they must either be
loosed immediately or die in the pit; for he that is the Lord of hosts
can relieve them when they are brought ever so low. It is also an
encouragement to the diligent captives, who, when liberty is proclaimed,
are willing to lose no time; let them know that the Lord is their God,
and, while they thus strive to help themselves, they may be sure he will
help them.

3\. He comforts all his people who depended upon what the prophets said
to them in the name of the Lord, and built their hopes upon it. When the
deliverances which the prophets spoke of either did not come so soon as
they looked for them or did not come up to the height of their
expectation they began to be cast down in their own eyes; but, as to
this, they are encouraged ([Isa 51:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#016).md)
by what God says to his prophet, not to this only, but to all his
prophets, nor to this, or them, principally, but to Christ, the great
prophet. It is a great satisfaction to those to whom the message is sent
to hear the God of truth and power say to his messenger, as he does
here, I have put my words in thy mouth, that by them I may plant the
heavens. God undertook to comfort his people ([Isa
51:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#012).md); but still he does it by his
prophets, by his gospel; and, that he may do it by these, he here tells
us, (1.) That his word in them is very true. He owns what they have said
to be what he had directed and enjoined them to say: "I have put my
words in thy mouth, and therefore he that receives thee and them
receives me." This is a great stay to our faith, that Christ's doctrine
was not his, but his that sent him, and that the words of the prophets
and apostles were God's own words, which he put into their mouths. God's
Spirit not only revealed to them the things themselves they spoke of,
but dictated to them the words they should speak ([Pe2
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#021.md); [Co1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#013).md); so that these are the true
sayings of God, of a God that cannot lie. (2.) That it is very safe: I
have covered thee in the shadow of my hand (as before, [Isa
49:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#002).md), which speaks the special
protection not only of the prophets, but of their prophecies, not only
of Christ, but of Christianity, of the gospel of Christ; it is not only
the faithful word of God which the prophets deliver to us, but it shall
be carefully preserved till it have its accomplishment for the use of
the church, notwithstanding the restless endeavours of the powers of
darkness to extinguish this light. They shall prophesy again ([Rev
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#011).md), though not in their persons,
yet in their writings, which God has always covered in the shadow of his
hand, preserved by a special providence, else they would have been lost
ere this. (3.) That this word, when it comes to be accomplished, will be
very great and will not fall short of the pomp and grandeur of the
prophecy: "I have put my words in thy mouth, not that by the performance
of them I may plant a nation, or found a city, but that I may plant the
heavens and lay the foundations of the earth, may do that for my people
which will be a new creation." This must look as far forward as to the
great work done by the gospel of Christ and the setting up of his holy
religion in the world. As God by Christ made the world at first ([Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002).md), and by him formed the Old
Testament church ([Zac 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012).md), so by
him, and the words put into his mouth, he will set up, \[1.\] A new
world, will again plant the heavens and found the earth. Sin having put
the whole creation into disorder, Christ's taking away the sin of the
world put all into order again. Old things have passed away, all things
have become new; things in heaven and things on earth are reconciled,
and so put into a new posture, [Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020.md). Through him, according to the
promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth ([Pe2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013).md), and to this the prophets bear
witness. \[2.\] He will set up a new church, a New Testament church: He
will say unto Zion, Thou art my people. The gospel church is called Zion
([Heb 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022).md) and Jerusalem ([Gal
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026).md); and, when the Gentiles are
brought into it, it shall be said unto them, You are my people. When God
works great deliverances for his church, and especially when he shall
complete the salvation of it in the great day, he will thereby own that
poor despised handful to be his people, whom he has chosen and loved.

[Isaiah 51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 51:17</span></span>

God, having awoke for the comfort of his people, here calls upon them to
awake, as afterwards, [Isa 52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001.md). It is
a call to awake not so much out of the sleep of sin (though that also is
necessary in order to their being ready for deliverance) as out of the
stupor of despair. When the inhabitants of Jerusalem were in captivity
they, as well as those who remained upon the spot, were so overwhelmed
with the sense of their troubles that they had no heart or spirit to
mind any thing that tended to their comfort or relief; they were as the
disciples in the garden, sleeping for sorrow ([Luk
22:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#045).md), and therefore, when the
deliverance came, they are said to have been like those that dream, [Psa
136:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#001.md). Nay, it is a call to awake, not
only from sleep, but from death, like that to the dry bones to live,
[Eze 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#009.md). "Awake, and look about
thee, that thou mayest see the day of thy deliverance dawn, and mayest
be ready to bid it welcome. Recover thy senses; sink not under thy load,
but stand up, and bestir thyself for thy own help." This may be applied
to the Jerusalem that was in the apostle's time, which is said to have
been in bondage with her children ([Gal
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#025).md), and to have been under the
power of a spirit of slumber ([Rom
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#008).md); they are called to awake, and
mind the things that belonged to their everlasting peace, and then the
cup of trembling should be taken out of their hands, peace should be
spoken to them, and they should triumph over Satan, who had blinded
their eyes and lulled them asleep. Now,

I. It is owned that Jerusalem had long been in a very deplorable
condition, and sunk into the depths of misery.

1\. She had lain under the tokens of God's displeasure. He had put into
her hand the cup of his fury, that is, her share of his displeasure. The
dispensations of his providence concerning her had been such that she
had reason to think he was angry with her. She had provoked him to anger
most bitterly, and was made to taste the bitter fruits of it. The cup of
God's fury is, and will be, a cup of trembling to all those that have it
put into their hands: damned sinners will find it so to eternity. It is
said ([Psa 75:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008).md) that the dregs of the
cup, the loathsome sediments in the bottom of it, all the wicked of the
earth shall wring them out, and drink them; but here Jerusalem, having
made herself as the wicked of the earth, is compelled to wring them out
and drink them; for wherever there has been a cup of fornication, as
there had been in Jerusalem's hand when she was idolatrous, sooner or
later there will be a cup of fury, a cup of trembling. Therefore stand
in awe and sin not.

2\. Those that should have helped her in her distress failed her, and
were either unable or unwilling to help her, as might have been
expected, [Isa 51:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#018.md). She is
intoxicated with the cup of God's fury, and, being so, staggers, and is
very unsteady in her counsels and attempts. She knows not what she says
or does, much less knows she what to say or do; and, in this unhappy
condition, of all the sons that she has brought forth and brought up,
that she was borne and educated (and there were many famous ones, for of
Zion it was said that this and that man were born there, [Psa
87:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#005).md), there is none to guide her,
none to take her by the hand to keep her either from falling or from
shaming herself, to lend either a hand to help her out of her trouble or
a tongue to comfort her under it. Think it not strange if wise and good
men are disappointed in their children, and have not that succour from
them which they expected, but those that were arrows in their hand prove
arrows in their heart, when Jerusalem herself has none of all her sons,
prince, priest, nor prophet, that has such a sense either of duty or
gratitude as to help her when she has most need of help. Thus they
complain, [Psa 74:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#009.md). There is none to
tell us how long. Now that which aggravated this disappointment was,
(1.) That her trouble was very great, and yet there was none to pity or
help her: These two things have come unto thee ([Isa
51:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#019).md), to complete thy desolation and
destruction, even the famine and the sword, two sore judgments, and very
terrible. Or the two things were the desolation and destruction by which
the city was wasted and the famine and sword by which the citizens
perished. Or the two things were the trouble itself (made up of
desolation, destruction, famine, and sword) and her being helpless,
forlorn, and comfortless, under it. "Two sad things indeed, to be in
this woeful case, and to have none to pity thee, to sympathize with thee
in thy griefs, or to help to bear the burden of thy cares, to have none
to comfort thee, by suggesting that to thee which might help to
alleviate thy grief or doing that for thee which might help to redress
thy grievances." Or these two things that had come upon Jerusalem are
the same with the two things that were afterwards to come upon Babylon
([Isa 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#009).md), loss of children and
widowhood - piteous case, and yet, "when thou hast brought it upon
thyself by thy own sin and folly, who shall be sorry for thee? - a case
that calls for comfort, and yet, when thou art froward under thy
trouble, frettest, and makest thyself uneasy, by whom shall I comfort
thee?" Those that will not be counselled cannot be helped. (2.) That
those who should have been her comforters were their own tormentors
([Isa 51:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#020).md): They have fainted, as
quite dispirited and driven to despair; they have no patience in which
to keep possession of their own souls and the enjoyment of themselves,
nor any confidence in God's promise, by which to keep possession of the
comfort of that. They throw themselves upon the ground, in vexation at
their troubles, and there they lie at the head of all the streets,
complaining to all that pass by ([Lam
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#012).md), pining away for want of
necessary food; there they lie like a wild bull in a net, fretting and
raging, struggling and pulling, to help themselves, but entangling
themselves so much the more, and making their condition the worse by
their own passions and discontents. Those that are of a meek and quiet
spirit are, under affliction, like a dove in a net, people, as their
patron and protector, who takes what is done against them a done against
himself." The cause of God's people, and of that holy religion which
they profess, is a righteous cause, otherwise the righteous God would
not appear for it; yet it may for a time be run down, and seem as if it
were lost. But God will plead it, either by convincing the consciences
or confounding the mischievous projects of those that fight against it.
He will plead it by clearing up the equity and excellency of it to the
world and by giving success to those that act in defence of it. It is
his own cause; he has espoused it, and therefore will plead it with
jealousy. 3. That they should shortly take leave of their troubles and
bid a final farewell to them: "I will take out of thy hand the cup of
trembling, that bitter cup; it shall pass from thee." Throwing away the
cup of trembling will not do, nor saying, "We will not, we cannot, drink
it;" but, if we patiently submit, he that put it into out hands will
himself take it out of our hands. Nay, it is promised, "Thou shalt no
more drink it again. God has let fall his controversy with thee, and
will not revive the judgment." 4. That their persecutors and oppressors
should be made to drink of the same bitter cup of which they had drunk
so deeply, [Isa 51:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#023). See here, (1..md)
How insolently they had abused and trampled upon the people of God: They
have said to thy soul, to thee, to thy life, Bow down, that we may go
over. Nay, they have said it to thy conscience, taking a pride and
pleasure in forcing thee to worship idols. Herein the New Testament
Babylon treads in the steps of that old oppressor, tyrannizing over
men's consciences, giving law to them, putting them upon the rack, and
compelling them to sinful compliances. Those that set up an infallible
head and judge, requiring an implicit faith in his dictates and
obedience to his commands, do in effect say to men's souls, Bow down,
that we may go over, and they say it with delight. (2.) How meanly the
people of God (having by their sin lost much of their courage and sense
of honour) truckled to them: Thou hast laid thy body as the ground.
Observe, The oppressors required souls to be subjected to them, that
every man should believe and worship just as they would have them. But
all they could gain by their threats and violence was that people laid
their bodies on the ground; they brought them to an external and
hypocritical conformity, but conscience cannot be forced, nor is it
mentioned to their praise that they yielded thus far. But observe, (3.)
How justly God will reckon with those who have carried it so imperiously
towards his people: The cup of trembling shall be put into their hand.
Babylon's case shall be as bad as ever Jerusalem's was. Daniel's
persecutors shall be thrown into Daniel's den; let them see how they
like it. And the Lord is known by these judgments which he executes.
