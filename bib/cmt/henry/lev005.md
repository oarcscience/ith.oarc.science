### [Leviticus Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 5:0</span></span>

This chapter, and part of the next, concern the trespass-offering. The
difference between this and the sin-offering lay not so much in the
sacrifices themselves, and the management of them, as in the occasions
of the offering of them. They were both intended to make atonement for
sin; but the former was more general, this applied to some particular
instances. Observe what is here said, I. Concerning the trespass. If a
man sin, 1. In concealing his knowledge, when he is adjured ([Lev
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001).md). 2. In touching an unclean thing
([Lev 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#002.md), [Lev
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#003).md). 3. In swearing ([Lev
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#004).md). 4. In embezzling the holy things
([Lev 5:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#014).md). 5. In any sin of
infirmity ([Lev 5:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#017).md). Some other
cases there are, in which these offerings were to be offered ([Lev
6:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#002.md); [Lev
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#012.md); [Lev
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#021.md); [Num
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#012).md). II. Concerning the
trespass-offerings, 1. Of the flock ([Lev
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#005.md), [Lev
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#006).md). 2. Of fowls ([Lev
5:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#007).md). 3. Of flour ([Lev
5:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#011.md); but chiefly a ram without
blemish ([Lev 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#015), etc..md).

[Leviticus 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 5:1</span></span>

I. The offences here supposed are, 1. A man's concealing the truth when
he was sworn as a witness to speak the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth. Judges among the Jews had power to adjure not
only the witnesses, as with us, but the person suspected (contrary to a
rule of our law, that no man is bound to accuse himself), as appears by
the high priest adjuring our Saviour, who thereupon answered, though
before he stood silent, [Mat 26:63](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#063.md),
[Mat 26:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064.md). Now ([Lev
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001).md), If a soul sin (that is, a
person, for the soul is the man), if he hear the voice of swearing (that
is, if he be adjured to testify what he knows, by an oath of the Lord
upon him, [Kg1 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#031).md), if in such a
case, for fear of offending one that either has been his friend or may
be his enemy, he refuses to give evidence, or gives it but in part, he
shall bear his iniquity. And that is a heavy burden, which, if some
course be not taken to get it removed, will sink a man to the lowest
hell. He that heareth cursing (that is, that is thus adjured) and
betrayeth it not (that is, stifles his evidence, and does not utter it),
he is a partner with the sinner, and hateth his own soul; see [Pro
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#024.md). Let all that are called out at
any time to bear testimony think of this law, and be free and open in
their evidence, and take heed of prevaricating. An oath of the Lord is a
sacred thing, and not to be dallied with. 2. A man's touching any thing
that was ceremonially unclean, [Lev
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#002.md), [Lev
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#003.md). If a man, polluted by such touch,
came into the sanctuary inconsiderately, or if he neglected to wash
himself according to the law, then he was to look upon himself as under
guilt, and must bring his offering. Though his touching the unclean
thing contracted only a ceremonial defilement, yet his neglect to wash
himself according to the law was such an instance either of carelessness
or contempt as contracted a moral guilt. If at first it be hidden from
him, yet when he knows it he shall be guilty. Note, As soon as ever God
by his Spirit convinces our consciences of any sin or duty we must
immediately set in with the conviction, and prosecute it, as those that
are not ashamed to own our former mistake. 3. Rash swearing. If a man
binds himself by an oath that he will do or not do such a thing, and the
performance of his oath afterwards proves either unlawful or
impracticable, by which he is discharged from the obligation, yet he
must bring an offering to atone for his fully in swearing so rashly, as
David that he would kill Nabal. And then it was that he must say before
the angel that it was an error, [Ecc
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#006.md). He shall be guilty in one of
these ([Lev 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#004).md), guilty if he do not
perform his oath, and yet, if the matter of it were evil, guilty if he
do. Such wretched dilemmas as these do some men bring themselves into by
their own rashness and folly; go which way they will their consciences
are wounded, sin stares them in the face, so sadly are they snared in
the words of their mouth. A more sad dilemma this is than that of the
lepers, "If we sit still, we die; if we stir, we die." Wisdom and
watchfulness beforehand would prevent these straits.

II\. Now in these cases, 1. The offender must confess his sin and bring
his offering ([Lev 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#005.md), [Lev
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#006).md); and the offering was not
accepted unless it was accompanied with a penitential confession and a
humble prayer for pardon. Observe, The confession must be particular,
that he hath sinned in that thing; such was David's confession ([Psa
51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004).md), I have done this evil; and
Achan's ([Jos 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#020).md), Thus and thus
have I done. Deceit lies in generals; many will own in general they have
sinned, for that all must own, so that it is not any particular reproach
to them; but that they have sinned in this thing they stand too much
upon their honour to acknowledge: but the way to be well assured of
pardon, and to be well armed against sin for the future, is to be
particular in our penitent confessions. 2. The priest must make
atonement for him. As the atonement was not accepted without his
repentance, so his repentance would not justify him without the
atonement. Thus, in our reconciliation to God, Christ's part and ours
are both needful.

[Leviticus 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 5:7</span></span>

Provision is here made for the poor of God's people, and the pacifying
of their consciences under the sense of guilt. Those that were not able
to bring a lamb might bring for a sin-offering a pair of turtle-doves or
two young pigeons; nay, if any were so extremely poor that they were not
able to procure these so often as they would have occasion, they might
bring a pottle of fine flour, and this should be accepted. Thus the
expense of the sin-offering was brought lower than that of any other
offering, to teach us that no man's poverty shall ever be a bar in the
way of his pardon. The poorest of all may have atonement made for them,
if it be not their own fault. Thus the poor are evangelized; and no man
shall say that he had not wherewithal to bear the charges of a journey
to heaven. Now,

I. If the sinner brought two doves, one was to be offered for a
sin-offering and the other for a burnt-offering, [Lev
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#007.md). Observe, 1. Before he offered the
burnt-offering, which was for the honour and praise of God, he must
offer the sin-offering, to make atonement. We must first see to it that
our peace be made with God, and then we may expect that our services for
his glory will be accepted. The sin-offering must make way for the
burnt-offering. 2. After the sin-offering, which made atonement, came
the burnt-offering, as an acknowledgment of the great mercy of God in
appointing and accepting the atonement.

II\. If he brought fine flour, a handful of it was to be offered, but
without either oil or frankincense ([Lev
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#011).md), not only because this would
make it too costly for the poor, for whose comfort this sacrifice was
appointed, but because it was a sin-offering, and therefore, to show the
loathsomeness of the sin for which it was offered, it must not be made
grateful either to the taste by oil or to the smell by frankincense. The
unsavouriness of the offering was to intimate that the sinner must never
relish his sin again as he had done. God by these sacrifices did speak,
1. Comfort to those that had offended, that they might not despair, nor
pine away in their iniquity; but, peace being thus made for them with
God, they might have peace in him. 2. Caution likewise not to offend any
more, remembering what an expensive troublesome thing it was to make
atonement.

[Leviticus 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 5:14</span></span>

Hitherto in this chapter orders were given concerning those sacrifices
that were both sin-offerings and trespass-offerings, for they go by both
names, [Lev 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#006.md). Here we have the law
concerning those that were properly and peculiarly trespass-offerings,
which were offered to atone for trespasses done against a neighbour,
those sins we commonly call trespasses. Now injuries done to another may
be either in holy things or in common things; of the former we have the
law in these verses; of the latter in the beginning of the next chapter.
If a man did harm (as it is [Lev 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#016).md)
in the holy things of the Lord, he thereby committed a trespass against
the priests, the Lord's ministers, who were entrusted with the care of
these holy things, and had the benefit of them. Now if a man did
alienate or convert to his own use any thing that was dedicated to God,
unwittingly, he was to bring this sacrifice; as suppose he had
ignorantly made use of the tithes, or first-fruits, or first-born of his
cattle, or (which, it should seem by [Lev
22:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#014), is principally meant here.md)
had eaten any of those parts of the sacrifices which were appropriated
to the priests; this was a trespass. It is supposed to be done through
mistake, or forgetfulness, for want either of care or zeal; for if it
was done presumptuously, and in contempt of the law, the offender died
without mercy, [Heb 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#028.md). But in case
of negligence and ignorance this sacrifice was appointed; and Moses is
told, 1. What must be done in case the trespass appeared to be certain.
The trespasser must bring an offering to the Lord, which, in all those
that were purely trespass-offerings, must be a ram without blemish, "of
the second year," say the Jewish doctors. He must likewise make
restitution to the priest, according to a just estimation of the thing
which he had so alienated, adding a fifth part to it, that he might
learn to take more heed next time of embezzling what was sacred to God,
finding to his cost that there was nothing got by it, and that he paid
dearly for his oversights. 2. What must be done in case it were doubtful
whether he had trespassed or no; he had cause to suspect it, but he wist
it not ([Lev 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#017).md), that is, he was
not very certain; in this case, because it is good to be sure, he must
bring his trespass-offering, and the value of that which he feared he
had embezzled, only he was not to add the fifth part to it. Now this was
designed to show the very great evil there is in sacrilege. Achan, that
was guilty of it presumptuously, died for it; so did Ananias and
Sapphira. But this goes further to show the evil of it, that if a man
had, through mere ignorance, and unwittingly, alienated the holy things,
nay, if he did but suspect that he had done so, he must be at the
expense, not only of a full restitution with interest, but of an
offering, with the trouble of bringing it, and must take shame to
himself, by making confession of it; so bad a thing is it to invade
God's property, and so cautious should we be to abstain from all
appearances of this evil. We are also taught here to be jealous over
ourselves with a godly jealousy, to ask pardon for the sin, and make
satisfaction for the wrong, which we do but suspect ourselves guilty of.
In doubtful cases we should take and keep the safer side.
