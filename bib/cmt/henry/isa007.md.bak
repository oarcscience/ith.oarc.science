### [Isaiah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 7:0</span></span>

This chapter is an occasional sermon, in which the prophet sings both of
mercy and judgment to those that did not perceive or understand either;
he piped unto them, but they danced not, mourned unto them, but they
wept not. Here is, I. The consternation that Ahaz was in upon an attempt
of the confederate forces of Syria and Israel against Jerusalem ([Isa
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001.md), [Isa
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#002).md). II. The assurance which God, by
the prophet, sent him for his encouragement, that the attempt should be
defeated and Jerusalem should be preserved ([Isa
7:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003).md). III. The confirmation of this
by a sign which God gave to Ahaz, when he refused to ask one, referring
to Christ, and our redemption by him ([Isa
7:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#010).md). IV. A threatening of the
great desolation that God would bring upon Ahaz and his kingdom by the
Assyrians, notwithstanding their escape from this present storm, because
they went on still in their wickedness ([Isa
7:17-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#017).md). And this is written both for
our comfort and for our admonition.

[Isaiah 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 7:1</span></span>

The prophet Isaiah had his commission renewed in the year that king
Uzziah died, [Isa 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md). Jotham his son
reigned, and reigned well, sixteen years. All that time, no doubt,
Isaiah prophesied as he was commanded, and yet we have not in this book
any of his prophecies dated in the reign of Jotham; but this, which is
put first, was in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham. Many excellent
useful sermons he preached which were not published and left upon
record; for, if all that was memorable had been written, the world could
not have contained the books, [Joh
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#025.md). Perhaps in the reign of Ahaz, a
wicked king, he had not opportunity to preach so much at court as in
Jotham's time, and therefore then he wrote the more, for a testimony
against them. Here is,

I. A very formidable design laid against Jerusalem by Rezin king of
Syria and Pekah king of Israel, two neighbouring potentates, who had of
late made descents upon Judah severally. At the end of the reign of
Jotham, the Lord began to send against Judah Rezin and Pekah, [Kg2
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#037.md). But now, in the second or third
year of the reign of Ahaz, encouraged by their former successes, they
entered into an alliance against Judah. Because Ahaz, though he found
the sword over his head, began his reign with idolatry, God delivered
him into the hand of the king of Syria and of the king of Israel ([Ch2
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#005).md), and a great slaughter they made
in his kingdom, [Isa 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#006.md), [Isa
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#007.md). Flushed with this victory, they
went up towards Jerusalem, the royal city, to war against it, to besiege
it, and make themselves masters of it; but it proved in the issue that
they could not gain their point. Note, The sin of a land brings foreign
invasions upon it and betrays the most advantageous posts and passes to
the enemy; and God sometimes makes one wicked nation a scourge to
another; but judgment, ordinarily, begins at the house of God.

II\. The great distress that Ahaz and his court were in when they
received advice of this design: It was told the house of David that
Syria and Ephraim had signed a league against Judah, [Isa
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#002.md). This degenerate royal family is
called the house of David, to put us in mind of that article of God's
covenant with David ([Psa 89:30-33](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#030).md),
If his children forsake my law, I will chasten their transgression with
the rod; but my loving-kindness will I not utterly take away, which is
remarkably fulfilled in this chapter. News being brought that the two
armies of Syria and Israel were joined, and had taken the field, the
court, the city, and the country, were thrown into consternation; The
heart of Ahaz was moved with fear, and then no wonder that the heart of
his people was so, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.
They were tossed and shaken, and put into a great disorder and
confusion, were wavering and uncertain in their counsels, hurried hither
and thither, and could not fix in any steady resolution. They yielded to
the storm, and gave up all for gone, concluding it in vain to make any
resistance. Now that which caused this fright was the sense of guilt and
the weakness of their faith. They had made God their enemy, and knew not
how to make him their friend, and therefore their fears tyrannised over
them; while those whose consciences are kept void of offence, and whose
hearts are fixed, trusting in God, need not be afraid of evil tidings;
though the earth be removed, yet will not they fear; but the wicked flee
at the shaking of a leaf, [Lev 26:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#036.md).

III\. The orders and directions given to Isaiah to go and encourage Ahaz
in his distress; not for his own sake (he deserved to hear nothing from
God but words of terror, which might add affliction to his grief), but
because he was a son of David and king of Judah. God had kindness for
him for his father's sake, who must not be forgotten, and for his
people's sake, who must not be abandoned, but would be encouraged if
Ahaz were. Observe,

1\. God appointed the prophet to meet Ahaz, though he did not send to
the prophet to speak with him, nor desire him to enquire of the Lord for
him ([Isa 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003).md): Go to meet Ahaz. Note,
God is often found of those who seek him not, much more will he be found
of those who seek him diligently. He speaks comfort to many who not only
are not worthy of it, but do not so much as enquire after it.

3\. He ordered him to take his little son with him, because he carried a
sermon in his name, Shear-jashub - A remnant shall return. The prophets
sometimes recorded what they preached in the significant names of their
children (as [Hos 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#004.md), [Hos
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#006.md), [Hos
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#009).md); therefore Isaiah's children are
said to be for signs, [Isa 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#018.md). This
son was so called for the encouragement of those of God's people who
were carried captive, assuring them that they should return, at least a
remnant of them, which was more than they could pretend to merit; yet at
this time God was better than his word; for he took care not only that a
remnant should return, but the whole number of those whom the
confederate forces of Syria and Israel had taken prisoners, [Ch2
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#015.md).

3\. He directed him where he should find Ahaz. He was to meet with him
not in the temple, or the synagogue, or royal chapel, but at the end of
the conduit of the upper pool, where he was, probably with many of his
servants about him, contriving how to order the water-works, so as to
secure them to the city, or deprive the enemy of the benefits of them
([Isa 22:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#009.md); [Ch2
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#003.md), [Ch2
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#004).md), or giving some necessary
directions for the fortifying of the city as well as they could; and
perhaps finding every thing in a bad posture or defence, the conduit out
of repair, as well as other things gone to decay, his fears increased,
and he was now in greater perplexity than ever; therefore, Go, meet him
there. Note, God sometimes sends comforts to his people very seasonably,
and, what time they are most afraid, encourages them to trust in him.

4\. He put words in his mouth, else the prophet would not have known how
to bring a message of good to such a bad man, a sinner in Zion, that
ought to be afraid; but God intended it for the support of faithful
Israelites.

(1.) The prophet must rebuke their fears, and advise them by no means to
yield to them, but keep their temper, and preserve the possession of
their own souls ([Isa 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#004).md): Take heed,
and be quiet. Note, In order to comfort there is need of caution; that
we may be quiet, it is necessary that we take heed and watch against
those things that threaten to disquiet us. "Fear not with this
amazement, this fear, that weakens, and has torment; neither let thy
heart be tender, so as to melt and fail within thee; but pluck up thy
spirits, have a good heart on it, and be courageous; let not fear betray
the succours which reason and religion offer for thy support." Note,
Those who expect God should help them must help themselves, [Psa
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#014.md).

(2.) He must teach them to despise their enemies, not in pride, or
security, or incogitancy (nothing more dangerous than so to despise an
enemy), but in faith and dependence upon God. Ahaz's fear called them
two powerful politic princes, for either of whom he was an unequal
match, but, if united, he durst not look them in the face, nor make head
against them. "No," says the prophet, "they are two tails of smoking
firebrands; they are angry, they are fierce, they are furious, as
firebrands, as fireballs; and they make one another worse by being in a
confederacy, as sticks of fire put together burn the more violently. But
they are only smoking firebrands: and where there is smoke there is some
fire, but it may be not so much as was feared. Their threatenings will
vanish into smoke. Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise ([Jer
46:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#017).md), and Rezin king of Syria but a
smoke; and such are all the enemies of God's church, smoking flax, that
will soon be quenched. Nay, they are but tails of smoking firebrands, in
a manner burnt out already; their force is spent; they have consumed
themselves with the heat of their own anger; you may put your foot on
them, and tread them out." The two kingdoms of Syria and Israel were now
near expiring. Note, The more we have an eye to God as a consuming fire
the less reason we shall have to fear men, though they are ever so
furious, nay, we shall be able to despise them as smoking firebrands.

(3.) He must assure them that the present design of these high allies
(so they thought themselves) against Jerusalem should certainly be
defeated and come to nothing, [Isa
7:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#005.md). \[1.\] That very thing which
Ahaz thought most formidable is made the ground of their defeat - and
that was the depth of their designs and the height of their hopes:
"Therefore they shall be baffled and sent back with shame, because they
have taken evil counsel against thee, which is an offence to God. These
firebrands are a smoke in his nose ([Isa
65:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#005).md), and therefore must be
extinguished." First, They are very spiteful and malicious, and,
therefore they shall not prosper. Judah had done them no wrong; they had
no pretence to quarrel with Ahaz; but, without any reason, they said,
Let us go up against Judah, and vex it. Note, Those that are vexatious
cannot expect to be prosperous, those that love to do mischief cannot
expect to do well. Secondly, They are very secure, and confident of
success. They will vex Judah by going up against it; yet that is not
all: they do not doubt but to make a breach in the wall of Jerusalem
wide enough for them to march their army in at; or they count upon
dissecting or dividing the kingdom into two parts, one for the king of
Israel, the other for the king of Syria, who had agreed in one viceroy -
a king to be set in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal, some
obscure person, it is uncertain whether a Syrian or an Israelite. So
sure were they of gaining their point that they divided the prey before
they had caught it. Note, Those that are most scornful are commonly
least successful, for surely God scorns the scorners. \[2.\] God himself
gives them his word that the attempt should not take effect ([Isa
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#007).md): "Thus saith the Lord God, the
sovereign Lord of all, who brings the counsel of the heathen to naught
([Psa 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#010).md), It shall not stand,
neither shall it come to pass; their measures shall all be broken, and
they shall not be able to bring to pass their enterprise." Note,
Whatever stands against God, or thinks to stand without him, cannot
stand long. Man purposes, but God disposes; and who is he that saith and
it cometh to pass if the Lord commands it not or countermands it? [Lam
3:37](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#037.md). See [Pro
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#021.md).

(4.) He must give them a prospect of the destruction of these enemies,
at last, that were now such a terror to them. \[1.\] They should neither
of them enlarge their dominions, nor push their conquests any further;
The head city of Syria is Damascus, and the head man of Damascus is
Rezin; this he glories in, and this let him be content with, [Isa
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#008.md). The head city of Ephraim has long
been Samaria, and the head man in Samaria is now Pekah the son of
Remaliah. These shall be made to know their own, their bounds are fixed,
and they shall not pass them, to make themselves masters of the cities
of Judah, much less to make Jerusalem their prey. Note, As God has
appointed men the bounds of their habitation ([Act
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#026).md), so he has appointed princes
the bounds of their dominion, within which they ought to confine
themselves, and not encroach upon their neighbours' rights. \[2.\]
Ephraim, which perhaps was the more malicious and forward enemy of the
two, should shortly be quite rooted out, and should be so far from
seizing other people's lands that they should not be able to hold their
own. Interpreters are much at a loss how to compute the sixty-five years
within which Ephraim shall cease to be a people; for the captivity of
the ten tribes was but eleven years after this: and some make it a
mistake of the transcriber, and think it should be read within six and
five years, just eleven. But it is hard to allow that. Others make it to
be sixty-five years from the time that the prophet Amos first foretold
the ruin of the kingdom of the ten tribes; and some late interpreters
make it to look as far forward as the last desolation of that country by
Esarhaddon, which was about sixty-five years after this; then Ephraim
was so broken that it was no more a people. Now it was the greatest
folly in the world for those to be ruining their neighbours who were
themselves marked for ruin, and so near to it. See what a prophet told
them at this time, when they were triumphing over Judah, [Ch2
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#010.md). Are there not with you, even
with you, sins against the Lord your God?

(5.) He must urge them to mix faith with those assurances which he had
given them ([Isa 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#009).md): "If you will
not believe what is said to you, surely you shall not be established;
your shaken and disordered state shall not be established, your unquiet
unsettled spirit shall not; though the things told you are very
encouraging, yet they will not be so to you, unless you believe them,
and be willing to take God's word." Note, The grace of faith is
absolutely necessary to the quieting and composing of the mind in the
midst of all the tosses of this present time, [Ch2
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#020.md).

[Isaiah 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 7:10</span></span>

Here, I. God, by the prophet, makes a gracious offer to Ahaz, to confirm
the foregoing predictions, and his faith in them, by such sign or
miracle as he should choose ([Isa
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#010.md), [Isa
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#011).md): Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy
God; See here the divine faithfulness and veracity. God tells us nothing
but what he is able and ready to prove. See his wonderful condescension
to the children of men, in that he is so willing to show to the heirs of
promise the immutability of his counsel, [Heb
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#017.md). He considers our frame, and
that, living in a world of sense, we are apt to require sensible proofs,
which therefore he has favoured us with in sacramental signs and seals.
Ahaz was a bad man, yet God is called the Lord his God, because he was a
child of Abraham and David, and of the covenants made with them. See how
gracious God is even to the evil and unthankful; Ahaz is bidden to
choose his sign, as Gideon about the fleece ([Jdg
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#037).md); let him ask for a sign in the
air, or earth, or water, for God's power is the same in all.

II\. Ahaz rudely refuses this gracious offer, and (which is not mannerly
towards any superior) kicks at the courtesy, and puts a slight upon it
([Isa 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#012).md): I will not ask. The true
reason why he would not ask for a sign was because, having a dependence
upon the Assyrians, their forces, and their gods, for help, he would not
thus far be beholden to the God of Israel, or lay himself under
obligations to him. He would not ask a sign for the confirming of his
faith because he resolved to persist in his unbelief, and would indulge
his doubts and distrusts; yet he pretends a pious reason: I will not
tempt the Lord; as if it would be a tempting of God to do that which God
himself invited and directed him to do. Note, A secret disaffection to
God is often disguised with the specious colours of respect to him; and
those who are resolved that they will not trust God yet pretend that
they will not tempt him.

III\. The prophet reproves him and his court, him and the house of
David, the whole royal family, for their contempt of prophecy, and the
little value they had for divine revelation ([Isa
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#013).md) "Is it a small thing for you to
weary men by your oppression and tyranny, with which you make yourselves
burdensome and odious to all mankind? But will you weary my God also
with the affronts you put upon him?" As the unjust judge that neither
feared God nor regarded man, [Luk
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#002.md). You have wearied the Lord with
your words, [Mal 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#017.md). Nothing is more
grievous to the God of heaven than to be distrusted. "Will you weary my
God? Will you suppose him to be tired and unable to help you, or to be
weary of doing you good? Whereas the youths may faint and be weary, you
may have tired all your friends, the Creator of the ends of the earth
faints not, neither is weary." [Isa
40:28-31](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#028.md). Or this: "In affronting the
prophets, you think you put a slight only upon men like yourselves, and
consider not that you affront God himself, whose messengers they are,
and put a slight upon him, who will resent it accordingly." The prophet
here calls God his God with a great deal of pleasure: Ahaz would not
say, He is my God, though the prophet had invited him to say so ([Isa
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#011).md): The Lord thy God; but Isaiah
will say, "He is mine." Note, Whatever others do, we must avouch the
Lord for ours and abide by him.

IV\. The prophet, in God's name, gives them a sign: "You will not ask a
sign, but the unbelief of man shall not make the promise of God of no
effect: The Lord himself shall give you a sign ([Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014).md), a double sign."

1\. "A sign in general of his good-will to Israel and to the house of
David. You may conclude it that he has mercy in store for you, and that
you are not forsaken of your God, how great soever your present distress
and danger are; for of your nation, of your family, the Messiah is to be
born, and you cannot be destroyed while that blessing is in you, which
shall be introduced," (1.) "In a glorious manner; for, whereas you have
been often told that he should be born among you, I am now further to
tell you that he shall be born of a virgin, which will signify both the
divine power and the divine purity with which he shall be brought into
the world, - that he shall be a extraordinary person, for he shall not
be born by ordinary generation, - and that he shall be a holy thing, not
stained with the common pollutions of the human nature, therefore
incontestably fit to have the throne of his father David given him." Now
this, though it was to be accomplished above 500 years after, was a most
encouraging sign to the house of David (and to them, under that title,
this prophecy is directed, [Isa 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#013).md)
and an assurance that God would not cast them off. Ephraim did indeed
envy Judah ([Isa 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#013).md) and sought the
ruin of that kingdom, but could not prevail; for the sceptre should
never depart from Judah till the coming of Shiloh, [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md). Those whom God designs for the
great salvation may take that for a sign to them that they shall not be
swallowed up by any trouble they meet with in the way. (2.) The Messiah
shall be introduced on a glorious errand, wrapped up in his glorious
name: They shall call his name Immanuel - God with us, God in our
nature, God at peace with us, in covenant with us. This was fulfilled in
their calling him Jesus - a Saviour ([Mat
1:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021).md), for, if he had not been
Immanuel - God with us, he could not have been Jesus - a Saviour. Now
this was a further sign of God's favour to the house of David and the
tribe of Judah; for he that intended to work this great salvation among
them no doubt would work out for them all those other salvations which
were to be the types and figures of this, and as it were preludes to
this. "Here is a sign for you, not in the depth nor in the height, but
in the prophecy, in the promise, in the covenant made with David, which
you are no strangers to. The promised seed shall be Immanuel, God with
us; let that word comfort you ([Isa
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#010)), that God is with us, and (v. 8.md)
that your land is Immanuel's land. Let not the heart of the house of
David be moved thus ([Isa 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#002).md), nor
let Judah fear the setting up of the son of Tabeal ([Isa
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#006).md), for nothing can cut off the
entail on the Son of David that shall be Immanuel." Note, The strongest
consolations, in time of trouble, are those which are borrowed from
Christ, our relation to him, our interest in him, and our expectations
of him and from him. Of this child it is further foretold ([Isa
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#015).md) that though he shall not be born
like other children, but of a virgin, yet he shall be really and truly
man, and shall be nursed and brought up like other children: Butter and
honey shall he eat, as other children do, particularly the children of
that land which flowed with milk and honey. Though he be conceived by
the power of the Holy Ghost, yet he shall not therefore be fed with
angels' food, but, as it becomes him, shall be in all things made like
unto his brethren, [Heb 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017.md). Nor
shall he, though born thus by extraordinary generation, be a man
immediately, but, as other children, shall advance gradually through the
several states of infancy, childhood, and youth, to that of manhood, and
growing in wisdom and stature, shall at length wax strong in spirit, and
come to maturity, so as to know how to refuse the evil and choose the
good. See [Luk 2:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#040.md), [Luk
2:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#052.md). Note, Children are fed when they
are little that they may be taught and instructed when they have grown
up; they have their maintenance in order to their education.

2\. Here is another sign in particular of the speedy destruction of
these potent princes that were now a terror to Judah, [Isa
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#016.md). "Before this child (so it should
be read), this child which I have now in my arms" (he means not
Immanuel, but Shear-jashub his own son, whom he was ordered to take with
him for a sign, [Isa 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003).md), "before
this child shall know how to refuse the evil and choose the good" (and
those who saw what his present stature and forwardness were would easily
conjecture how long that would be), "before this child be three or four
years older, the land that thou abhorrest, these confederate forces of
Israelites and Syrians, which thou hast such an enmity to and standest
in such dread of, shall be forsaken of both their kings, both Pekah and
Rezin," who were in so close an alliance that they seemed as if they
were the kings of but one kingdom. This was fully accomplished; for
within two or three years after this, Hoshea conspired against Pekah,
and slew him ([Kg2 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#030).md), and, before
that, the king of Assyria took Damascus, and slew Rezin, [Kg2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009.md). Nay, there was a present event,
which happened immediately, and when this child carried the prediction
of in his name, which was a pledge and earnest of this future event.
Shear-jashub signifies The remnant shall return, which doubtless points
at the wonderful return of those 200,000 captives whom Pekah and Rezin
had carried away, who were brought back, not by might or power, but by
the Spirit of the Lord of hosts. Read the story, [Ch2
28:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#008.md). The prophetical naming of
this child having thus had its accomplishment, no doubt this, which was
further added concerning him, should have its accomplishment likewise,
that Syria and Israel should be deprived of both their kings. One mercy
from God encourages us to hope for another, if it engages us to prepare
for another.

[Isaiah 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 7:17</span></span>

After the comfortable promises made to Ahaz as a branch of the house of
David, here follow terrible threatenings against him, as a degenerate
branch of that house; for though the loving-kindness of God shall not be
utterly taken away, for the sake of David and the covenant made with
him, yet his iniquity shall be chastened with the rod, and his sin with
stripes. Let those that will not mix faith with the promises of God
expect to hear the alarms of his threatenings.

I. The judgment threatened is very great, [Isa
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#017.md). It is very great, for it is
general; it shall be brought upon the prince himself (high as he is, he
shall not be out of the reach of it), and upon the people, the whole
body of the nation, and upon the royal family, upon all thy father's
house; it shall be a judgment entailed on posterity, and shall go along
with the royal blood. It is very great, for it shall be unprecedented -
days that have not come; so dark, so gloomy, so melancholy, as never
were the like since the revolt of the ten tribes, when Ephraim departed
from Judah, which was indeed a sad time to the house of David. Note, The
longer men continue in sin the sorer punishments they have reason to
expect. It is the Lord that will bring these days upon them, for our
times are in his hand, and who can resist or escape the judgments he
brings?

II\. The enemy that should be employed as the instrument of this
judgment is the king of Assyria. Ahaz reposed great confidence in that
prince for help against the confederate powers of Israel and Syria, and
minded the less what God said to him by his prophet for his
encouragement because he built much upon his interest in the king of
Assyria, and had meanly promised to be his servant if he would send him
some succours; he had also, made him a present of gold and silver, for
which he drained the treasures both of church and state, [Kg2
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007.md), [Kg2
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#008.md). Now God threatens that that king
of Assyria whom he made his stay instead of God should become a scourge
to him. He was so speedily; for, when he came to him, he distressed him,
but strengthened him not ([Ch2 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#020).md),
the reed not only broke under him, but ran into his hand, and pierced
it, and thenceforward the kings of Assyria were, for a long time,
grieving thorns to Judah, and gave them a great deal of trouble. Note,
The creature that we make our hope commonly proves our hurt. The king of
Assyria, not long after this, made himself master of the ten tribes,
carried them captive, and laid their country waste, so as fully to
answer the prediction here; and perhaps it may refer to that, as an
explication of [Isa 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#008.md), where it is
foretold that Ephraim shall be broken, that it shall not be a people;
and it is easy to suppose that the prophet (at [Isa
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#017).md) turns his speech to the king of
Israel, denouncing God's judgments against him for invading Judah. But
the expositors universally understand it of Ahaz and his kingdom. Now
observe, 1. Summons given to the invaders ([Isa
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#018).md): The Lord shall whistle for the
fly and the bee. See [Isa 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026.md).
Enemies that seem as contemptible as a fly or a bee, and are as easily
crushed, shall yet, when God pleases, do his work as effectually as
lions and young lions. Though they are as far distant from one another
as the rivers of Egypt and the land of Assyria, yet they shall
punctually meet to join in this work when God commands their attendance;
for, when God has work to do, he will not be at a loss for instruments
to do it with. 2. Possession taken by them, [Isa
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#019.md). It should seem as if the country
were in no condition to make resistance. They find no difficulties in
forcing their way, but come and rest all of them in the desolate
valleys, which the inhabitants had deserted upon the first alarm, and
left them a cheap and easy prey to the invaders. They shall come and
rest in the low grounds like swarms of flies and bees, and shall render
themselves impregnable by taking shelter in the holes of the rocks, as
bees often do, and showing themselves formidable by appearing openly
upon all thorns and all bushes; so generally shall the land be
overspread with them. These bees shall knit upon the thorns and bushes,
and there rest undisturbed. 3. Great desolations made, and the country
generally depopulated ([Isa 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#020).md): The
Lord shall shave the hair of the head, and beard, and feet; he shall
sweep all away, as the leper, when he was cleansed, shaved off all his
hair, [Lev 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#008.md), [Lev
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#009.md). This is done with a razor which
is hired, either which God has hired (as if he had none of his own; but
what he hires, and whom he employs in any service for him, he will pay
for. See [Eze 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#018.md), [Eze
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#019).md), or which Ahaz has hired for
his assistance. God will make that to be an instrument of his
destruction which he hired into his service. Note, Many are beaten with
that arm of flesh which they trusted to rather than to the arm of the
Lord, and which they were at a great expense upon, when by faith and
prayer they might have found cheap and easy succour in God. 4. The
consequences of this general depopulation. (1.) The flocks of cattle
shall be all destroyed, so that a man who had herds and flocks in
abundance shall be stripped of them all by the enemy, and shall with
much ado save for his own use a young cow and two sheep - a poor stock
([Isa 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#021).md), yet he shall think
himself happy in having any left. (2.) The few cattle that are left
shall have such a large compass of ground to feed in that they shall
give abundance of milk, and very good milk, such as shall produce butter
enough, [Isa 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#022.md). There shall also be
such want of men that the milk of one cow and two sheep shall serve a
whole family, which used to keep abundance of servants and consume a
great deal, but is now reduced. (3.) The breed of cattle shall be
destroyed; so that those who used to eat flesh ( as the Jews commonly
did) shall be necessitated to confine themselves to butter and honey,
for there shall be no flesh for them; and the country shall be so
depopulated that there shall be butter and honey enough for the few that
are left in it. (4.) Good land, that used to be let well, shall be all
overrun with briers and thorns ([Isa
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#023).md); where there used to be a
thousand vines planted, for which the tenants used to pay a thousand
shekels, or pieces of silver, yearly rent, there shall be nothing now
but briers and thorns, no profit either for landlord or tenant, all
being laid waste by the army of the invaders. Note, God can soon turn a
fruitful land into barrenness; and it is just with him to turn vines
into briers if we, instead of bringing forth grapes to him, bring forth
wild grapes, [Isa 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#004). (5..md) The
implements of husbandry shall be turned into instruments of war, [Isa
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#024.md). The whole land having become
briers and thorns, the grounds that men used to come to with sickles and
pruning-hooks to gather in the fruits they shall now come to with arrows
and bows, to hunt for wild beasts in the thickets, or to defend
themselves from the robbers that lurk in the bushes, seeking for prey,
or to kill the serpents and venomous beasts that are hid there. This
denotes a very sad change of the face of that pleasant land. But what
melancholy change is there which sin will not make with a people? (6.)
Where briers and thorns were wont to be of use and to do good service,
even in the hedges, for the defence of the enclosed grounds, they shall
be plucked up, and all laid in common. There shall be briers and thorns
in abundance where they should not be, but none where they should be,
[Isa 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#025.md). The hills that shall be
digged with the mattock, for special use, from which the cattle used to
be kept off with the fear of briers and thorns, shall now be thrown
open, the hedges broken down for the boar out of the wood to waste it,
[Psa 80:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#012.md), [Psa
80:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#013.md). It shall be left at large for
oxen to run in and less cattle. See the effect of sin and the curse; it
has made the earth a forest of thorns and thistles, except as it is
forced into some order by the constant care and labour of man. And see
what folly it is to set our hearts upon possessions of lands, be they
every so fruitful, ever so pleasant; if they lie ever so little
neglected and uncultivated, or if they be abused by a wasteful careless
heir or tenant, or the country be laid waste by war, they will soon
become frightful deserts. Heaven is a paradise not subject to such
changes.
