### [Ezekiel Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 6:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have, I. A threatening of the destruction of Israel
for their idolatry, and the destruction of their idols with them ([Eze
6:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#001).md). II. A promise of the gracious
return of a remnant of them to God, by true repentance and reformation
([Eze 6:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#008).md). III. Directions given
to the prophet and others, the Lord's servants, to lament both the
iniquities and the calamities of Israel ([Eze
6:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#011).md).

[Ezekiel 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 6:1</span></span>

Here, I. The prophecy is directed to the mountains of Israel ([Eze
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#001.md), [Eze
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#002).md); the prophet must set his face
towards them. If he could see so far off as the land of Israel, the
mountains of that land would be first and furthest seen; towards them
therefore he must look, and look boldly and stedfastly, as the judge
looks at the prisoner, and directs his speech to him, when he passes
sentence upon him. Though the mountains of Israel be ever so high and
ever so strong, he must set his face against them, as having judgments
to denounce that should shake their foundation. The mountains of Israel
had been holy mountains, but now that they had polluted them with their
high places God set his face against them and therefore the prophet
must. Israel is here put, not, as sometimes, for the ten tribes, but for
the whole land. The mountains are called upon to hear the word of the
Lord, to shame the inhabitants that would not hear. The prophets might
as soon gain attention from the mountains as from that rebellious and
gainsaying people, to whom they all day long stretched out their hands
in vain. Hear, O mountains! the Lord's controversy ([Mic
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001.md), [Mic
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#002).md), for God's cause will have a
hearing, whether we hear it or no. But from the mountains the word of
the Lord echoes to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; for to
them also the Lord God speaks, intimating that the whole land is
concerned in what is now to be delivered and shall be witnesses against
this people that they had fair warning given them of the judgments
coming, but they would not take it; nay, they contradicted the message
and persecuted the messengers, so that God's prophets might more safely
and comfortably speak to the hills and mountains than to them.

II\. That which is threatened in this prophecy is the utter destruction
of the idols and the idolaters, and both by the sword of war. God
himself is commander-in-chief of this expedition against the mountains
of Israel. It is he that says, Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword
upon you ([Eze 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#003).md); the sword of the
Chaldeans is at God's command, goes where he sends it, comes where he
brings it, and lights as he directs it. In the desolations of that war,

1\. The idols and all their appurtenances should be destroyed. The high
places, which were on the tops of mountains ([Eze
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#003).md), shall be levelled and made
desolate ([Eze 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#006).md); they shall not be
beautified, shall not be frequented as they had been. The altars, on
which they offered sacrifice and burnt incense to strange gods, shall be
broken to pieces and laid waste; the images and idols shall be defaced,
shall be broken and cease, and be cut down, and all the fine costly
works about them shall be abolished, [Eze
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#004.md), [Eze
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#006). Observe here, (1..md) That war makes
woeful desolations, which those persons, places, and things that were
esteemed most sacred cannot escape; for the sword devours one as well as
another. (2.) That God sometimes ruins idolatries even by the hands of
idolaters, for such the Chaldeans themselves were; but, as if the deity
were a local thing, the greatest admirers of the gods of their own
country were the greatest despisers of the gods of other countries. (3.)
It is just with God to make that a desolation which we make an idol of;
for he is a jealous God and will not bear a rival. (4.) If men do not,
as they ought, destroy idolatry, God will, first or last, find out a way
to do it. When Josiah had destroyed the high places, altars, and images,
with the sword of justice, they set them up again; but God will now
destroy them with the sword of war, and let us see who dares
re-establish them.

2\. The worshippers of idols and all their adherents should be destroyed
likewise. As all their high places shall be laid waste, so shall all
their dwelling-places too, even all their cities, [Eze
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#006.md). Those that profane God's
dwelling-place as they had done can expect no other than that he should
abandon theirs, [Eze 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#011.md). If any man
defile the temple of God, him will God destroy, [Co1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#017.md). It is here threatened that their
slain shall fall in the midst of them ([Eze
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#007).md); there shall be abundance slain,
even in those places which were thought most safe; but it is added as a
remarkable circumstance that they shall fall before their idols ([Eze
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#004).md), that their dead carcases should
be laid, and their bones scattered, about their altars, [Eze
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#005). (1..md) Thus their idols should be
polluted, and those places profaned by the dead bodies which they had
had in veneration. If they will not defile the covering of their graven
images, God will, [Isa 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#022.md). The
throwing of the carcases among them, as upon the dunghill, intimates
that they were but dunghill-deities. (2.) Thus it was intimated that
they were but dead things, unfit to be rivals with the living God; for
the carcases of dead men, that, like them, have eyes and see not, ears
and hear not, were the fittest company for them. (3.) Thus the idols
were upbraided with their inability to help their worshippers, and
idolaters were upbraided with the folly of trusting in them; for, it
should seem, they fell by the sword of the enemy when they were actually
before their idols imploring their aid and putting themselves under
their protection. Sennacherib was slain by his sons when he was
worshipping in the house of his god. (4.) The sin might be read in this
circumstance of the punishment; the slain men are cast before the idols,
to show that therefore they are slain, because they worshipped those
idols; see [Jer 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#001.md), [Jer
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#002.md). let the survivors observe it, and
take warning not to worship images; let them see it, and know that God
is the Lord, that the Lord he is God and he alone.

[Ezekiel 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 6:8</span></span>

Judgment had hitherto triumphed, but in these verses mercy rejoices
against judgment. A sad end is made of this provoking people, but not a
full end. The ruin seems to be universal, and yet will I leave a
remnant, a little remnant, distinguished from the body of the people, a
few of many, such as are left when the rest perish; and it is God that
leaves them. This intimates that they deserved to be cut off with the
rest, and would have been cut off if God had not left them. See [Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009.md). And it is God who by his grace
works that in them which he has an eye to in sparing them. Now,

I. It is a preserved remnant, saved from the ruin which the body of the
nation is involved in ([Eze 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#008).md): That
you may have some who shall escape the sword. God said ([Eze
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#012).md) that he would draw a sword after
those who were scattered, that destruction should pursue them in their
dispersion; but here is mercy remembered in the midst of that wrath, and
a promise that some of the Jews of the dispersion, as they were
afterwards called, should escape the sword. None of those who were to
fall by the sword about Jerusalem shall escape; for they trust to
Jerusalem's walls for security, and shall be made ashamed of that vain
confidence. but some of them shall escape the sword among the nations,
where, being deprived of all other stays, they stay themselves upon God
only. They are said to have those who shall escape; for they shall be
the seed of another generation, out of which Jerusalem shall flourish
again.

II\. It is a penitent remnant ([Eze
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#009).md): Those who escape of you shall
remember me. Note, To those whom god designs for life he will give
repentance unto life. They are reprieved, and escape the sword, that
they may have time to return to God. Note, God's patience both leaves
room for repentance and is an encouragement to sinners to repent. Where
God designs grace to repent he allows space to repent; yet many who have
the space want the grace, many who escape the sword do not forsake the
sin, as it is promised that these shall do. This remnant, here marked
for salvation, is a type of the remnant reserved out of the body of
mankind to be monuments of mercy, who are made safe in the same way that
these were, by being brought to repentance. Now observe here,

1\. The occasion of their repentance, and that is a mixture of judgment
and mercy-judgment, that they were carried captives, but mercy, that
they escaped the sword in the land of their captivity. They were driven
out of their own land, but not out of the land of the living, not chased
out of the world, as other were and they deserved to be. Note, The
consideration of the just rebukes of Providence we are under, and yet of
the mercy mixed with them, should engage us to repent, that we may
answer God's end in both. And true repentance shall be accepted of God,
though we are brought to it by our troubles; nay, sanctified afflictions
often prove means of conversion, as to Manasseh.

2\. The root and principle of their repentance: They shall remember me
among the nations. Those who forgot God in the land of their peace and
prosperity, who waxed fat and kicked, were brought to remember him in
the land of their captivity. The prodigal son never bethought himself of
his father's house till he was ready to perish for hunger in the far
country. Their remembering God was the first step they took in returning
to him. Note, Then there begins to be some hopes of sinners when they
have sinned against, and to enquire, Where is God my Maker? Sin takes
rise in forgetting God, [Jer 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#021.md).
Repentance takes rise from the remembrance of him and of our obligations
to him. God says, They shall remember me, that is, "I will give them
grace to do so;" for otherwise they would for ever forget him. That
grace shall find them out wherever they are, and by bringing God to
their mind shall bring them to their right mind. The prodigal, when he
remembered his father, remembered how he has sinned against Heaven and
before him; so do these penitents. (1.) They remember the base affront
they had put upon God by their idolatries, and this is that which an
ingenuous repentance fastens upon and most sadly laments. They had
departed from God to idols, and given that honour to pretended deities,
the creatures of men's fancies and the work of men's hands, which they
should have given to the God of Israel. They departed from God, from his
word, which they should have made their rule, from his work, which they
should have made their business. Their hearts departed from him. The
heart, which he requires and insists upon, and without which bodily
exercise profits nothing, the heart, which should be set upon him, and
carried out towards him, when that departs from him, is as the
treacherous elopement of a wife from her husband or the rebellious
revolt of a subject from his sovereign. Their eyes also go after their
idols; they doted on them, and had great expectations from them. Their
hearts followed their eyes in the choice of their gods (they must have
gods that they could see), and then their eyes followed their hearts in
the adoration of them. Now the malignity of this sin is that it is
spiritual whoredom; it is a whorish heart that departs from God; and
they are eyes that go a whoring after their idols. Note, Idolatry is
spiritual whoredom; it is the breach of a marriage-covenant with God; it
is the setting of the affections upon that which is a rival with him,
and the indulgence of a base lust, which deceives and defiles the soul,
and is a great wrong to God in his honour, (2.) They remember what a
grief this was to him and how he resented it. They shall remember that I
am broken with their whorish heart and their eyes that are full of this
spiritual adultery, not only angry at it, but grieved, as a husband is
at the lewdness of a wife whom he dearly loved, grieved to such a degree
that he is broken with it; it breaks his heart to think that he should
be so disingenuously dealt with; he is broken as an aged father is with
the undutiful behaviour of a rebellious and disobedient son, which sinks
his spirits and makes him to stoop. Forty years long was I grieved with
this generation, [Psa 95:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#010.md). God's
measures were broken (so some); a stop was put to the current of his
favours towards them, and he was even compelled to punish them. This
they shall remember in the day of their repentance, and it shall affect
and humble them more than any thing, not so much that their peace was
broken, and their country broken, as that God was broken by their sin.
Thus they shall look on him whom they have pierced and shall mourn, [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md). Note, Nothing grieves a true
penitent so much as to think that his sin has been a grief to God and to
the Spirit of his grace.

3\. The product and evidence of their repentance: They shall loathe
themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their
abominations. Thus God will give them grace to qualify them for pardon
and deliverance. Though he had been broken by their whorish heart, yet
he would not quite cast them off. See [Isa
57:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#017.md), [Isa
57:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#018.md); [Hos
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#013.md), [Hos
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#014.md). His goodness takes occasion from
their badness to appear the more illustrious. note, (1.) True penitents
see sin to be an abominable thing, that abominable thing which the Lord
hates and which makes sinners, and even their services, odious to him,
[Jer 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#004.md); [Isa
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011.md). It defiles the sinner's own
conscience, and makes him, unless he be past feeling, an abomination to
himself. An idol is particularly called an abomination, [Isa
44:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#019.md). Those gratifications which the
hearts of sinners were set upon as delectable things the hearts of
penitents are turned against as detestable things. (2.) There are many
evils committed in these abominations, many included in them, attendant
on them, and flowing from them, many transgressions in one sin, [Lev
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#021.md). In their idolatries they were
sometimes guilty of whoredom (as in the worship of Peor), sometimes of
murder (as in the worship of Moloch); these were evils committed in
their abominations. Or it denotes the great malignity there is in sin;
it is an abomination that has abundance of evil in it. (3.) Those that
truly loathe sin cannot but loathe themselves because of sin;
self-loathing is evermore the companion of true repentance. Penitents
quarrel with themselves, and can never be reconciled to themselves till
they have some ground to hope that God is reconciled to them; nay, then
they shall lie down in their shame, when he is pacified towards them,
[Eze 16:63](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#063.md).

4\. The glory that will redound to God by their repentance ([Eze
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#010).md): "They shall know that I am the
Lord; they shall be convinced of it by experience, and shall be ready to
own it, and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto
them, finding that what I have said is made good, and made to work for
good, and to answer a good intention, and that it was not without just
provocation that they were thus threatened and thus punished." Note,
(1.) One way or other God will make sinners to know and own that he is
the lord, either by their repentance or by their ruin. (2.) All true
penitents are brought to acknowledge both the equity and the efficacy of
the word of God, particularly the threatenings of the word, and to
justify God in them and in the accomplishment of them.

[Ezekiel 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 6:11</span></span>

The same threatenings which we had before in the foregoing chapter, and
in the former part of this, are here repeated, with a direction to the
prophet to lament them, that those he prophesied to might be the more
affected with the foresight of them.

I. He must by his gestures in preaching express the dep sense he had
both of the iniquities and of the calamities of the house of Israel
([Eze 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#011).md): Smite with thy hand and
stamp with thy foot. Thus he must make it to appear that he was in
earnest in what he said to them, that he firmly believed it and laid it
to heart. Thus he must signify the just displeasure he had conceived at
their sins, and the just dread he was under of the judgments coming upon
them. Some would reject this use of these gestures, and call them antic
and ridiculous; but God bids him use them because they might help to
enforce the word upon some and give it the setting on; and those that
know the worth of souls will be content to be laughed at by the wits, so
they may but edify the weak. Two things the prophet must thus lament: -
1. National sins. Alas! for all the evil abominations of the house of
Israel. Note, The sins of sinners are the sorrows of God's faithful
servants, especially the evil abominations of the house of Israel, whose
sins are more abominable and have more evil in them than the sins of
others. Alas! What will be in the end hereof? 2. National judgments. To
punish them for these abominations they shall fall by the sword, by the
famine, and by the pestilence. Note, It is our duty to be affected not
only with our own sins and sufferings, but with the sins and sufferings
of others; and to look with compassion upon the miseries that wicked
people bring upon themselves; as Christ beheld Jerusalem and wept over
it.

II\. He must inculcate what he had said before concerning the
destruction that was coming upon them. 1. They shall be run down and
ruined by a variety of judgments which shall find them out and follow
them wherever they are ([Eze 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#012).md): He
that is far off, and thinks himself out of danger, because out of the
reach of the Chaldeans' arrows, shall find himself not out of the reach
of God's arrows, which fly day and night ([Psa
91:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#005).md): He shall die of the pestilence.
He that is near a place of strength, which he hopes will be to him a
place of safety, shall fall by the sword, before he can retreat. He that
is so cautious as not to venture out, but remains in the city, shall
there die by the famine, the saddest death of all. Thus will God
accomplish his fury, that is, do all that against them which he had
purposed to do. 2. They shall read their sin in their punishment; for
their slain men shall be among their idols, round about their altars, as
was threatened before, [Eze 6:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#005.md).
There, where they had prostrated themselves in honour of their idols,
God will lay them dead, to their own reproach and the reproach of their
idols. They lived among them and shall die among them. They had offered
sweet odours to their idols, but there shall their dead carcases send
forth an offensive smell, as it were to atone for that misplaced
incense. 3. The country shall be all laid waste, as, before, the cities
([Eze 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#006).md): I will make the land
desolate. That fruitful, pleasant, populous country, that has been as
the garden of the Lord, the glory of all lands, shall be desolate, more
desolate than the wilderness towards Diblath, [Eze
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#014.md). It is called Diblathaim ([Num
33:46](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#046.md); [Jer
48:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#022).md), that great and terrible
wilderness which is described, [Deu
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015.md), wherein were fiery serpents and
scorpions. The land of Canaan is at this day one of the most barren
desolate countries in the world. City and country are thus depopulated,
that the altars may be laid waste and made desolate, [Eze
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#006.md). Rather than their idolatrous
altars shall be left standing, both town and country shall be laid in
ruins. Sin is a desolating thing; therefore stand in awe and sin not.
