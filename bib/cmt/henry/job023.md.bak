### [Job Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 23:0</span></span>

This chapter begins Job's reply to Eliphaz. In this reply he takes no
notice of his friends, either because he saw it was to no purpose or
because he liked the good counsel Eliphaz gave him in the close of his
discourse so well that he would make no answer to the peevish
reflections he began with; but he appeals to God, begs to have his cause
heard, and doubts not but to make it good, having the testimony of his
own conscience concerning his integrity. Here seems to be a struggle
between flesh and spirit, fear and faith, throughout this chapter. I. He
complains of his calamitous condition, and especially of God's
withdrawings from him, so that he could not get his appeal heard ([Job
23:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#002).md), nor discern the meaning of
God's dealings with him ([Job 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#008.md),
[Job 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#009).md), nor gain any hope of
relief ([Job 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#013.md), [Job
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#014).md). This made deep impressions of
trouble and terror upon him ([Job
23:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#015).md). But, II. In the midst of
these complaints he comforts himself with the assurance of God's
clemency ([Job 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006.md), [Job
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#007).md), and his own integrity, which
God himself was a witness to ([Job
23:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#010).md). Thus was the light of his
day like that spoken of, [Zac 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#006.md),
[Zac 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#007.md), neither perfectly clear nor
perfectly dark, but "at evening time it was light."

[Job 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 23:1</span></span>

Job is confident that he has wrong done him by his friends, and
therefore, ill as he is, he will not give up the cause, nor let them
have the last word. Here,

I. He justifies his own resentments of his trouble ([Job
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#002).md): Even to day, I own, my
complaint is bitter; for the affliction, the cause of the complaint, is
so. There are wormwood and gall in the affliction and misery; my soul
has them still in remembrance and is embittered by them, [Lam
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#019.md), [Lam
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#020.md). Even to day is my complaint
counted rebellion (so some read it); his friends construed the innocent
expressions of his grief into reflections upon God and his providence,
and called them rebellion. "But," says he, "I do not complain more than
there is cause; for my stroke is heavier than my groaning. Even today,
after all you have said to convince and comfort me, still the pains of
my body and the wounds of my spirit are such that I have reason enough
for my complaints, if they were more bitter than they are." We wrong God
if our groaning be heavier than our stroke, like froward children, who,
when they cry for nothing, have justly something given them to cry for;
but we do not wrong ourselves though our stroke be heavier than our
groaning, for little said is soon amended.

II\. He appeals from the censures of his friends to the just judgment of
God; and this he thought was an evidence for him that he was not a
hypocrite, for then he durst not have made such an appeal as this. St
Paul comforted himself in this, that he that judged him was the Lord,
and therefore he valued not man's judgment ([Co1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#003.md), [Co1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#004).md), but he was willing to wait till
the appointed day of decision came; whereas Job is impatient, and
passionately wishes to have the judgment-day anticipated, and to have
his cause tried quickly, as it were, by a special commission. The
apostle found it necessary to press it much upon suffering Christians
patiently to expect the Judge's coming, [Jam
5:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007.md).

1\. He is so sure of the equity of God's tribunal that he longs to
appear before it ([Job 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#003).md): O that I
knew where I might find him! This may properly express the pious
breathings of a soul convinced that it has by sin lost God and is undone
for ever if it recover not its interest in his favour. "O that I knew
how I might recover his favour! How I might come into his covenant and
communion with him!" [Mic 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006.md), [Mic
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#007.md). It is the cry of a poor deserted
soul. "Saw you him whom my soul loveth? O that I knew where I might find
him! O that he who has laid open the way to himself would direct me into
it and lead me in it!" But Job here seems to complain too boldly that
his friends wronged him and he knew not which way to apply himself to
God to have justice done him, else he would go even to his seat, to
demand it. A patient waiting for death and judgment is our wisdom and
duty, and, if we duly consider things, that cannot be without a holy
fear and trembling; but a passionate wishing for death or judgment,
without any such fear and trembling, is our sin and folly, and ill
becomes us. Do we know what death and judgment are, and are we so very
ready for them, that we need not time to get readier? Woe to those that
thus, in a heat, desire the day of the Lord, [Amo
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018.md).

2\. He is so sure of the goodness of his own cause that he longs to be
opening it at God's bar ([Job 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#004).md):
"I would order my cause before him, and set it in a true light. I would
produce the evidences of my sincerity in a proper method, and would fill
my mouth with arguments to prove it." We may apply this to the duty of
prayer, in which we have boldness to enter into the holiest and to come
even to the footstool of the throne of grace. We have not only liberty
of access, but liberty of speech. We have leave, (1.) To be particular
in our requests, to order our cause before God, to speak the whole
matter, to lay before him all our grievances, in what method we think
most proper; we durst not be so free with earthly princes as a humble
holy soul may be with God. (2.) To be importunate in our requests. We
are allowed, not only to pray, but to plead, not only to ask, but to
argue; nay, to fill our mouths with arguments, not to move God (he is
perfectly apprized of the merits of the cause without our showing), but
to move ourselves, to excite our fervency and encourage our faith in
prayer.

3\. He is so sure of a sentence in favour of him that he even longed to
hear it ([Job 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#005).md): "I would know the
words which he would answer me," that is, "I would gladly hear what God
will say to this matter in dispute between you and me, and will entirely
acquiesce in his judgment." This becomes us, in all controversies; let
the word of God determine them; let us know what he answers, and
understand what he says. Job knew well enough what his friends would
answer him; they would condemn him, and run him down. "But" (says he) "I
would fain know what God would answer me; for I am sure his judgment is
according to truth, which theirs is not. I cannot understand them; they
talk so little to the purpose. But what he says I should understand and
therefore be fully satisfied in."

III\. He comforts himself with the hope that God would deal favourably
with him in this matter, [Job 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006.md),
[Job 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#007.md). Note, It is of great use to
us, in every thing wherein we have to do with God, to keep up good
thoughts of him. He believes, 1. That God would not overpower him, that
he would not deal with him either by absolute sovereignty or in strict
justice, not with a high hand, nor with a strong hand: Will he plead
against me with his great power? No. Job's friends pleaded against him
with all the power they had; but will God do so? No; his power is all
just and holy, whatever men's is. Against those that are obstinate in
their unbelief and impenitency God will plead with his great power;
their destruction will come from the glory of his power. But with his
own people, that love him and trust in him, he will deal in tender
compassion. 2. That, on the contrary, he would empower him to plead his
own cause before God: "He would put strength in me, to support me and
bear me up, in maintaining my integrity." Note, The same power that is
engaged against proud sinners is engaged for humble saints, who prevail
with God by strength derived from him, as Jacob did, [Hos
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#003.md). See [Psa
68:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#035.md). 3. That the issue would
certainly be comfortable, [Job 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#007.md).
There, in the court of heaven, when the final sentence is to be given,
the righteous might dispute with him and come off in his righteousness.
Now, even the upright are often chastened of the Lord, and they cannot
dispute against it; integrity itself is no fence either against calamity
or calumny; but in that day they shall not be condemned with the world,
though God may afflict by prerogative. Then you shall discern between
the righteous and the wicked ([Mal
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#018).md), so vast will be the difference
between them in their everlasting state; whereas now we can scarcely
distinguish them, so little is the difference between them as to their
outward condition, for all things come alike to all. Then, when the
final doom is given, "I shall be delivered for ever from my Judge," that
is, "I shall be saved from the unjust censures of my friends and from
that divine sentence which is now so much a terror to me." Those that
are delivered up to God as their owner and ruler shall be for ever
delivered from him as their judge and avenger; and there is no flying
from his justice but by flying to his mercy.

[Job 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 23:8</span></span>

Here, I. Job complains that he cannot understand the meaning of God's
providences concerning him, but is quite at a loss about them ([Job
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#008.md), [Job
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#009).md): I go forward, but he is not
there, etc. Eliphaz had bid him acquaint himself with God. "So I would,
with all my heart," says Job, "If I knew how to get acquainted with
him." He had himself a great desire to appear before God, and get a
hearing of his case, but the Judge was not to be found. Look which way
he would, he could see no sign of God's appearing for him to clear up
his innocency. Job, no doubt, believed that God is every where present;
but three things he seems to complain of here: - 1. That he could not
fix his thoughts, nor form any clear judgment of things in his own mind.
His mind was so hurried and discomposed with his troubles that he was
like a man in a fright, or at his wits' end, who runs this way and that
way, but, being in confusion, brings nothing to a head. By reason of the
disorder and tumult his spirit was in he could not fasten upon that
which he knew to be in God, and which, if he could but have mixed faith
with it and dwelt upon it in his thoughts, would have been a support to
him. It is the common complaint of those who are sick or melancholy
that, when they would think of that which is good, they can make nothing
of it. 2. That he could not find out the cause of his troubles, nor the
sin which provoked God to contend with him. He took a view of his whole
conversation, turned to every side of it, and could not perceive wherein
he had sinned more than others, for which he should thus be punished
more than others; nor could he discern what other end God should aim at
in afflicting him thus. 3. That he could not foresee what would be in
the end hereof, whether God would deliver him at all, nor, if he did,
when or which way. He saw not his signs, nor was there any to tell him
how long; as the church complains, [Psa
74:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#009.md). He was quite at a loss to know
what God designed to do with him; and, whatever conjecture he advanced,
still something or other appeared against it.

II\. He satisfies himself with this, that God himself was a witness to
his integrity, and therefore did not doubt but the issue would be good.

1\. After Job had almost lost himself in the labyrinth of the divine
counsels, how contentedly does he sit down, at length, with this
thought: "Though I know not the way that he takes (for his way is in the
sea and his path in the great waters, his thoughts and ways are
infinitely above ours and it would be presumption in us to pretend to
judge of them), yet he knows the way that I take," [Job
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#010). That is, (1..md) He is acquainted
with it. His friends judged of that which they did not know, and
therefore charged him with that which he was never guilty of; but God,
who knew every step he had taken, would not do so, [Psa
139:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#003.md). Note, It is a great comfort to
those who mean honestly that God understands their meaning, though men
do not, cannot, or will not. (2.) He approves of it: "He knows that,
however I may sometimes have taken a false step, yet I have still taken
a good way, have chosen the way of truth, and therefore he knows it,"
that is, he accepts it, and is well pleased with it, as he is said to
know the way of the righteous, [Psa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006.md). This comforted the prophet, [Jer
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#003.md). Thou hast tried my heart towards
thee. From this Job infers, When he hath tried me I shall come forth as
gold. Those that keep the way of the Lord may comfort themselves, when
they are in affliction, with these three things: - \[1.\] That they are
but tried. It is not intended for their hurt, but for their honour and
benefit; it is the trial of their faith, [Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md). \[2.\] That, when they are
sufficiently tried, they shall come forth out of the furnace, and not be
left to consume in it as dross or reprobate silver. The trial will have
an end. God will not contend for ever. \[3.\] That they shall come forth
as gold, pure in itself and precious to the refiner. They shall come
forth as gold approved and improved, found to be good and made to be
better. Afflictions are to us as we are; those that go gold into the
furnace will come out no worse.

2\. Now that which encouraged Job to hope that his present troubles
would thus end well was the testimony of his conscience for him, that he
had lived a good life in the fear of God.

(1.) That God's way was the way he walked in ([Job
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#011).md): "My foot hath held his steps,"
that is, "held to them, adhered closely to them; the steps he takes. I
have endeavoured to conform myself to his example." Good people are
followers of God. Or, "I have accommodated myself to his providence, and
endeavoured to answer all the intentions of that, to follow Providence
step by step." Or, "His steps are the steps he has appointed me to take;
the way of religion and serious godliness - that way I have kept, and
have not declined from it, not only not turned back from it by a total
apostasy, but not turned aside out of it by any wilful transgression."
His holding God's steps, and keeping his way, intimate that the tempter
had used all his arts by fraud and force to draw him aside; but, with
care and resolution, he had by the grace of God hitherto persevered, and
those that will do so must hold and keep, hold with resolution and keep
with watchfulness.

(2.) That God's word was the rule he walked by, [Job
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#012.md). He governed himself by the
commandment of God's lips, and would not go back from that, but go
forward according to it. Whatever difficulties we may meet with in the
way of God's commandments, though they lead us through a wilderness, yet
we must never think of going back, but must press on towards the mark.
Job kept closely to the law of God in his conversation, for both his
judgment and his affection led him to it: I have esteemed the words of
his mouth more than my necessary food; that is, he looked upon it as his
necessary food; he could as well have lived without his daily bread as
without the word of God. I have laid it up (so the word is), as those
that lay up provision for a siege, or as Joseph laid up corn before the
famine. Eliphaz had told him to lay up God's words in his heart, [Job
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#022.md). "I do," says he, "and always
did, that I might not sin against him, and that, like the good
householder, I might bring forth for the good of others." Note, The word
of God is to our souls what our necessary food is to our bodies; it
sustains the spiritual life and strengthens us for the actions of life;
it is that which we cannot subsist without, and which nothing else can
make up the want of: and we ought therefore so to esteem it, to take
pains for it, hunger after it, feed upon it with delight, and nourish
our souls with it; and this will be our rejoicing in the day of evil, as
it was Job's here.

[Job 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 23:13</span></span>

Some make Job to complain here that God dealt unjustly and unfairly with
him in proceeding to punish him without the least relenting or
relaxation, though he had such incontestable evidences to produce of his
innocency. I am loth to think holy Job would charge the holy God with
iniquity; but his complaint is indeed bitter and peevish, and he reasons
himself into a sort of patience per force, which he cannot do without
reflecting upon God as dealing hardly with him, but he must bear it
because he cannot help it; the worst he says is that God deals
unaccountably with him.

I. He lays down good truths, and truths which were capable of a good
improvement, [Job 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#013.md), [Job
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#014.md). 1. That God's counsels are
immutable: He is in one mind, and who can turn him? He is one (so some
read it) or in one; he has no counsellors by whose interest he might be
prevailed with to alter his purpose: he has no counsellors by whose
interest he might be prevailed with to alter his purpose: he is one with
himself, and never alters his mind, never alters his measures. Prayer
has prevailed to change God's way and his providence, but never was his
will or purpose changed; for known unto God are all his works. 2. That
his power is irresistible: What his soul desires or designs even that he
does, and nothing can stand in his way or put him upon new counsels. Men
desire many things which they may not do, or cannot do, or dare not do.
But God has an incontestable sovereignty; his will is so perfectly pure
and right that it is highly fit he should pursue all its determinations.
And he has an uncontrollable power. None can stay his hand. Whatever the
Lord pleased that did he ([Psa 135:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#006).md),
and always will, for it is always best. 3. That all he does is according
to the counsel of his will ([Job
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#014).md): He performs the thing that is
appointed for me. Whatever happens to us, it is God that performs it
([Psa 57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002).md), and an admirable
performance the whole will appear to be when the mystery of God shall be
finished. He performs all that, and that only, which was appointed, and
in the appointed time and method. This may silence us, for what is
appointed cannot be altered. But to consider that, when God was
appointing us to eternal life and glory as our end, he was appointing to
this condition, this affliction, whatever it is, in our way, this may do
more than silence us, it may satisfy us that it is all for the best;
though what he does we know not now, yet we shall know hereafter. 4.
That all he does is according to the custom of his providence: Many such
things are with him, that is, He does many things in the course of his
providence which we can give no account of, but must resolve into his
absolute sovereignty. Whatever trouble we are in others have been in the
like. Our case is not singular; the same afflictions are accomplished in
our brethren, [Pe1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#009.md). Are we sick or
sore, impoverished and stripped? Are our children removed by death or
our friends unkind? This is what God has appointed for us, and many such
things are with him. Shall the earth be forsaken for us?

II\. He makes but a bad use of these good truths. Had he duly considered
them, he might have said, "Therefore am I easy and pleased, and well
reconciled to the way of my God concerning me; therefore will I rejoice
in hope that my troubles will issue well at last." But he said,
Therefore am I troubled at his presence, [Job
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#015.md). Those are indeed of troubled
spirits who are troubled at the presence of God, as the psalmist, who
remembered God and was troubled, [Psa
77:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#003.md). See what confusion poor Job was
now in, for he contradicted himself: just now he was troubled for God's
absence ([Job 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#008.md), [Job
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#009).md); now he is troubled at his
presence. When I consider, I am afraid of him. What he now felt made him
fear worse. There is indeed that which, if we consider it, will show
that we have cause to be afraid of God - his infinite justice and
purity, compared with our own sinfulness and vileness; but if, withal,
we consider his grace in a Redeemer, and our compliance with that grace,
our fears will vanish and we shall see cause to hope in him. See what
impressions were made upon him by the wounds of his spirit. 1. He was
very fearful ([Job 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#016).md): The
Almighty troubled him, and so made his heart soft, that is, utterly
unable to bear any thing, and afraid of every thing that stirred. There
is a gracious softness, like that of Josiah, whose heart was tender, and
trembled at the word of God; but this is meant of a grievous softness
which apprehends every thing that is present to be pressing and every
thing future to be threatening. 2. He was very fretful, peevish indeed,
for he quarrels with God, (1.) Because he did not die before his
troubles, that he might never have seen them (Because I was not cut off
before the darkness, [Job 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#017).md), and
yet if, in the height of his prosperity, he had received a summons to
the grave, he would have thought it hard. This may help to reconcile us
to death, whenever it comes, that we do not know what evil we may be
taken away from. But when trouble comes it is folly to wish we had not
lived to see it and it is better to make the best of it. (2.) Because he
was left to live so long in his troubles, and the darkness was not
covered from his face by his being hidden in the grave. We should bear
the darkness better than thus if we would but remember that to the
upright there sometimes arises a marvellous light in the darkness;
however, there is reserved for them a more marvellous light after it.
