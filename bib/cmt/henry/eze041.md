### [Ezekiel Chapter 41](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 41:0</span></span>

An account was given of the porch of the house in the close of the
foregoing chapter; this brings us to the temple itself, the description
of which here given creates much difficulty to the critical expositors
and occasions differences among them. Those must consult them who are
nice in their enquiries into the meaning of the particulars of this
delineation; it shall suffice us to observe, I. The dimensions of the
house, the posts of it ([Eze 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001).md),
the door ([Eze 41:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#002).md), the wall and the
side-chambers ([Eze 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#005.md), [Eze
41:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#006).md), the foundations and wall of the
chambers, their doors ([Eze 41:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#008).md),
and the house itself ([Eze 41:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#013).md). II.
The dimensions of the oracle, or most holy place ([Eze
41:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#003.md), [Eze
41:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#004).md). III. An account of another
building over against the separate place ([Eze
41:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#012).md). IV. The manner of the
building of the house ([Eze 41:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#007.md), [Eze
41:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#016.md), [Eze
41:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#017).md). V. The ornaments of the house
([Eze 41:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#018).md). VI. The altar of
incense and the table ([Eze 41:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#022).md).
VII. The doors between the temple and the oracle ([Eze
41:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#023).md). There is so much difference
both in the terms and in the rules of architecture between one age and
another, one place and another, that it ought not to be any
stumbling-block to us that there is so much in these descriptions dark
and hard to be understood, about the meaning of which the learned are
not agreed. To one not skilled in mathematics the mathematical
description of a modern structure would be scarcely intelligible; and
yet to a common carpenter or mason among the Jews at that time we may
suppose that all this, in the literal sense of it, was easy enough.

[Ezekiel 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 41:1</span></span>

We are still attending a prophet that is under the guidance of an angel,
and therefore attend with reverence, though we are often at a loss to
know both what this is and what it is to us. Observe here, 1. After the
prophet had observed the courts he was at length brought to the temple,
[Eze 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001.md). If we diligently attend to
the instructions given us in the plainer parts of religion, and profit
by them, we shall be led further into an acquaintance with the mysteries
of the kingdom of heaven. Those that are willing to dwell in God's
courts shall at length be brought into his temple. Ezekiel was himself a
priest, but by the iniquity and calamity of the times was cut short of
his birthright privilege of ministering in the temple; but God makes up
the loss to him by introducing him into this prophetical, evangelical,
celestial temple, and employing him to transmit a description of it to
the church, in which he was dignified above all the rest of his order.
2. When our Lord Jesus spoke of the destroying of this temple, which his
hearers understood of this second temple of Jerusalem, he spoke of the
temple of his body ([Joh 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019.md), [Joh
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#021).md); and with good reason might he
speak so ambiguously when Ezekiel's vision had a joint respect to them
both together, including also his mystical body the church, which is
called the house of God ([Ti1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015).md),
and all the members of that body, which are living temples, in which the
Spirit dwells. 3. The very posts of this temple, the door-posts, were as
far one from the other, and consequently the door was as wide, as the
whole breadth of the tabernacle of Moses ([Eze
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001).md), namely, twelve cubits, [Exo
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#016.md), [Exo
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#022.md), [Exo
26:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#025.md). In comparison with what had
been under the law we may say, Wide is the gate which leads into the
church, the ceremonial law, that wall of partition which had so much
straitened the gate, being taken down. 4. The most holy place was an
exact square, twenty cubits each way, [Eze
41:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#004.md). For the new Jerusalem is exactly
square ([Rev 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#016).md), denoting its
stability; for we look for a city that cannot be moved. 5. The upper
stories were larger than the lower, [Eze
41:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#007.md). The walls of the temple were six
cubits thick at the bottom, five in the middle story, and four in the
highest, which gave room to enlarge the chambers the higher they went;
but care was taken that the timber might have fast hold (though God
builds high, he builds firmly), yet so as not to weaken one part for the
strengthening of another; they had hold, but not in the wall of the
house. By this spreading gradually, the side-chambers that were on the
height of the house (in the uppermost story of all) were six cubits,
whereas the lowest were but four; they gained a cubit every story. The
higher we build up ourselves in our most holy faith the more should our
hearts, those living temples, be enlarged.

[Ezekiel 41:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 41:12</span></span>

Here is, 1. An account of a building that was before the separate place
(that is, before the temple), at the end towards the west ([Eze
41:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#012).md), which is here measured, and
compared ([Eze 41:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#013).md) with the measure
of the house, and appears to be of equal dimensions with it. This stood
in a court by itself, which is measured ([Eze
41:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#015).md) and its galleries, or chambers
belonging to it, its posts and windows, and the ornaments of them, [Eze
41:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#015.md). But what use was to be made
of this other building we are not told; perhaps, in this vision, it
signified the setting up of a church among the Gentiles not inferior to
the Jewish temple, but of quite another nature, and which should soon
supersede it. 2. A description of the ornaments of the temple, and the
other building. The walls on the inside from top to bottom were adorned
with cherubim and palm-trees, placed alternately, as in Solomon's
temple, [Kg1 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#029.md). Each cherub is here
said to have two faces, the face of a man towards the palm tree on one
side and the face of a young lion towards the palm-tree on the other
side, [Eze 41:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#019.md). These seem to
represent the angels, who have more than the wisdom of a man and the
courage of a lion; and in both they have an eye to the palms of victory
and triumph which are set before them, and which they are sure of in all
their conflicts with the powers of darkness. And in the assemblies of
the saints angels are in a special manner present, [Co1
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#010.md). 3. A description of the posts
of the doors both of the temple and of the sanctuary; they were squared
([Eze 41:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#021).md), not round like pillars;
and the appearance of the one was as the appearance of the other. In the
tabernacle, and in Solomon's temple, the door of the sanctuary, or most
holy, was narrower than that of the temple, but here it was fully as
broad; for in gospel-times the way into the holiest of all is made more
manifest than it was under the Old Testament ([Heb
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#008).md) and therefore the door is wider.
These doors are described, [Eze 41:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#023.md),
[Eze 41:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#024.md). The temple and the
sanctuary had each of them its door, and they were two-leaved, folding
doors. 4. We have here the description of the altar of incense, here
said to be an altar of wood, [Eze
41:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#022.md). No mention is made of its being
over-laid with gold; but surely it was intended to be so, else it would
not bear the fire with which the incense was to be burned, unless we
will suppose that it served only to put the censers upon. Or else it
intimates that the incense to be offered in the gospel-temple shall be
purely spiritual, and the fire spiritual, which will not consume an
altar of wood. Therefore this altar is called a table. This is the table
that is before the Lord. Here, as before, we find the altar turned into
a table; for, the great sacrifice being now offered, that which we have
to do is to feast upon the sacrifice at the Lord's table. 5. Here is the
adorning of the doors and windows with palm-trees, that they might be of
a piece with the walls of the house, [Eze
41:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#025.md), [Eze
41:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#026.md). Thus the living temples are
adorned, not with gold, or silver, or costly array, but with the hidden
man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible.
