### [Judges Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#001.md)

[Judges](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jdg 12:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have, I. Jephthah's rencounter with the Ephraimites,
and the blood shed on that unhappy occasion ([Jdg
12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#001).md), and the conclusion of
Jephthah's life and government ([Jdg
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#007).md). II. A short account of three
other of the judges of Israel: Ibzan ([Jdg
12:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#008).md), Elon ([Jdg
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#011.md), [Jdg
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#012).md), Abdon ([Jdg
12:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#013).md).

[Judges 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 12:1</span></span>

Here Is, I. The unreasonable displeasure of the men of Ephraim against
Jephthah, because he had not called them in to his assistance against
the Ammonites, that they might share in the triumphs and spoils, [Jdg
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#001.md). Pride was at the bottom of the
quarrel. Only by that comes contention. Proud men think all the honours
lost that go beside themselves, and then who can stand before envy? The
Ephraimites had the same quarrel with Gideon ([Jdg
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#001).md), who was of Manasseh on their
side Jordan, as Jephthah was of Manasseh on the other side Jordan.
Ephraim and Manasseh were hearer akin than any other of the tribes,
being both the sons of Joseph, and yet they were more jealous one of
another than any other of the tribes. Jacob having crossed hands, and
given Ephraim the preference, looking as far forward as the kingdom of
the ten tribes, which Ephraim was the head of, after the revolt from the
house of David, that tribe, not content with that honour in the promise,
was displeased if Manasseh had any honour done it in the mean time. It
is a pity that kindred or relationship, which should be an inducement to
love and peace, should be ever an occasion (as it often proves) of
strife and discord. A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong
city, and contentions among brethren are as the bars of a castle. The
anger of the Ephraimites at Jephthah was, 1. Causeless and unjust. Why
didst thou not call us to go with thee? For a good reason. Because it
was the men of Gilead that had made him their captain, not the men of
Ephraim, so that he had no authority to call them. Had his attempt
miscarried for want of their help, they might justly have blamed him for
not desiring it. But when the work was done, and done effectually, the
Ammonites being subdued and Israel delivered, there was no harm done,
though their hands were not employed in it. 2. It was cruel and
outrageous. They get together in a tumultuous manner, pass over Jordan
as far as Mizpeh in Gilead, where Jephthah lived, and no less will
satisfy their fury but they will burn his house and him in it. Cursed be
their anger, for it was fierce. Those resentments that have the least
reason for them have commonly the most rage in them. Jephthah was now a
conqueror over the common enemies of Israel, and they should have come
to congratulate him, and return him the thanks of their tribe for the
good services he had done; but we must not think it strange if we
receive ill from those from whom we deserve well. Jephthah was now a
mourner for the calamity of his family upon his daughter's account, and
they should have come to condole with him and comfort him; but barbarous
men take a pleasure in adding affliction to the afflicted. In this
world, the end of one trouble often proves the beginning of another; nor
must we ever boast as though we had put off the harness.

II\. Jephthah's warm vindication of himself. He did not endeavour to
pacify them, as Gideon had done in the like case; the Ephraimites were
now more outrageous than they were them, and Jephthah had not so much of
a meek and quiet spirit as Gideon had. Whether they would be pacified or
no, Jephthah takes care,

1\. To justify himself, [Jdg 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#002.md),
[Jdg 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#003.md). He makes it out that they
had no cause at all to quarrel with him, for, (1.) It was not in pursuit
of glory that he had engaged in this war, but for the necessary defence
of his country, with which the children of Ammon greatly strove. (2.) He
had invited the Ephraimites to come and join with him, though he neither
needed them nor was under any obligation to pay that respect to them,
but they had declined the service: I called you, and you delivered me
not out of their hands. Had that been true which they charged him with,
yet it would not have been a just ground of quarrel; but it seems it was
false, and, as the matter of fact now appears, he had more cause to
quarrel with them for deserting the common interests of Israel in a time
of need. It is no new thing for those who are themselves most culpable
to be most clamorous in accusing the innocent. (3.) The enterprise was
very hazardous, and they had more reason to pity him than to be angry
with him: I put my life in my hands, that is, "exposed myself to the
utmost peril in what I did, having so small an army," The honour they
envied was bought dearly enough; they needed not to grudge it to him;
few of them would have ventured so far for it. (4.) He does not take the
glory of the success to himself (that would have been invidious), but
gives it all to God: "The Lord delivered them into my hands. If God was
pleased so far to make use of me for his glory, why should you be
offended at that? Have you any reason to fight against me? Is not that
in effect to fight against God, in whose hand I have been only an
unworthy instrument?"

2\. When this just answer (though not so soft an answer as Gideon's) did
not prevail to turn away their wrath, he took care both to defend
himself from their fury and to chastise their insolence with the sword,
by virtue of his authority as Israel's judge. (1.) The Ephraimites had
not only quarrelled with Jephthah, but, when his neighbours and friends
appeared to take his part, they had abused them, and given them foul
language; for I adhere to our translation, and so take it, [Jdg
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#004.md). They said in scorn, "You
Gileadites that dwell here on the other side Jordan are but fugitives of
Ephraim, the scum and dregs of the tribes of Joseph, of which Ephraim is
the chief, the refuse of the family, and are so accounted among the
Ephraimites and among the Manassites. Who cares for you? All your
neighbours know what you are, no better than fugitives and vagabonds,
separated from your brethren, and driven hither into a corner." The
Gileadites were as true Israelites as any other, and at this time had
signalized themselves, both in the choice of Jephthah and in the war
with Ammon, above all the families of Israel, and yet are most basely
and unjustly called fugitives. It is an ill thing to fasten names or
characters of reproach upon persons or countries, as is common,
especially upon those that lie under outward disadvantages: it often
occasions quarrels that prove of ill consequence, as it did here. See
likewise what a mischievous thing an abusive tongue is, that calls ill
names, and gives scurrilous language: it sets on fire the course of
nature, and is set on fire of hell ([Jam
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#006).md), and many a time cuts the throat
of him that uses it, as it did here, [Psa
64:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#008.md). If these Ephraimites could have
denied themselves the poor satisfaction of calling the Gileadites
fugitives, they might have prevented a great deal of bloodshed; for
grievous words stir up anger, and who knows how great a matter a little
of that fire may kindle? (2.) This affront raises the Gileadites' blood,
and the indignity done to themselves, as well as to their captain, must
be revenged. \[1.\] They routed them in the field, [Jdg
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#004.md). They fought with Ephraim, and,
Ephraim being but a rude unheaded rabble, smote Ephraim, and put them to
flight. \[2.\] They cut off their retreat, and so completed their
revenge, [Jdg 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#005.md), [Jdg
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#006.md). The Gileadites, who perhaps were
better acquainted with the passages of Jordan than the Ephraimites were,
secured them with strong guards, who were ordered to slay every
Ephraimite that offered to pass the river. Here was, First, Cruelty
enough in the destruction of them. Sufficient surely was the punishment
which was inflicted by many; when they were routed in the field, there
needed not this severity to cut off all that escaped. Shall the sword
devour for ever? Whether Jephthah is to be praised for this I know not;
perhaps he saw it to be a piece of necessary justice. Secondly, Cunning
enough in the discovery of them. It seems the Ephraimites, though they
spoke the same language with other Israelites, yet had got a custom in
the dialect of their country to pronounce the Hebrew letter Shin like
Samech, and they had so strangely used themselves to it that they could
not do otherwise, no, not to save their lives. We learn to speak by
imitation; those that first used s for sh, did it either because it was
shorter or because it was finer, and their children learnt to speak like
them, so that you might know an Ephraimite by it; as in England we know
a west-country man or a north-country man, nay, perhaps a Shropshire
man, and a Cheshire man, by his pronunciation. Thou art a Galilean, and
thy speech betrays thee. By this the Ephraimites were discovered. If
they took a man that they suspected to be an Ephraimite, but he denied
it, they bade him say Shibboleth; but either he could not, as our
translation reads it, or he did not heed, or frame, or direct himself,
as some read, to pronounce it aright, but said Sibboleth, and so was
known to be an Ephraimite, and was slain immediately. Shibboleth
signifies a river or stream: "Ask leave to go over Shibboleth, the
river." Those that were thus cut off made up the whole number of
slaughtered Ephraimites forty-two thousand, [Jdg
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#006.md). Thus another mutiny of that
angry tribe was prevented.

3\. Now let us observe the righteousness of God in the punishment of
these proud and passionate Ephraimites, which in several instances
answered to their sin. (1.) They were proud of the honour of their
tribe, gloried in this, that they were Ephraimites; but how soon were
they brought to be ashamed or afraid to own their country! Art thou an
Ephraimite? No, now rather of any tribe than that. (2.) They had gone in
a rage over Jordan to burn Jephthah's house with fire, but now they came
back to Jordan as sneakingly as they had passed it furiously, and were
cut off from ever returning to their own houses. (3.) They had upbraided
the Gileadites with the infelicity of their country, lying at such a
distance, and now they suffered by an infirmity peculiar to their own
country, in not being able to pronounce Shibboleth. (4.) They had called
the Gileadites, unjustly, fugitives, and now they really and in good
earnest became fugitives themselves; and in the Hebrew the same word
([Jdg 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#005).md) is used of the Ephraimites
that escaped, or that fled, which they had used in scorn of the
Gileadites, calling them fugitives. He that rolls the stone of reproach
unjustly upon another, let him expect that it will justly return upon
himself.

III\. Here is the end of Jephthah's government. He judged Israel but six
years, and then died, [Jdg 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#007.md).
Perhaps the death of his daughter sunk him so that he never looked up
afterwards, but it shortened his days, and he went to his grave
mourning.

[Judges 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 12:8</span></span>

We have here a short account of the short reigns of three more of the
judges of Israel, the first of whom governed but seven years, the second
ten, and the third eight. For the transgression of a land, many are the
princes thereof, many in a short time, successively ([Pro
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#002).md), good men being removed in the
beginning of their usefulness and by the time that they have applied
themselves to their business.

I. Ibzan of Bethlehem, most probably Bethlehem of Judah, David's city,
not that in Zebulun, which is only mentioned once, [Jos
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#015.md). He ruled but seven years, but
by the number of his children, and his disposing of them all in marriage
himself, it appears that he lived long; and probably the great increase
of his family, and the numerous alliances he made, added to his personal
merits, made him the more fit to be either chosen by the people as
Jephthah was, or called of God immediately, as Gideon was, to be
Israel's judge, to keep up and carry on the work of God among them. That
which is remarkable concerning him is, 1. That he had many children,
sixty in all, a quiver full of these arrows. Thus was Bethlehem of old
famous for increase, the very city where he was to be born whose
spiritual seed should be as the stars of heaven. 2. That he had an equal
number of each sex, thirty sons and thirty daughters, a thing which does
not often happen in the same family, yet, in the great family of
mankind, he that at first made two, male and female, by his wise
providence preserves a succession of both in some sort of equality as
far as is requisite to the keeping up of the generations of men upon
earth. 3. That he took care to marry them all. His daughters he sent
abroad, et maritis dedit, so the vulgar Latin adds - he provided
husbands for them; and, as it were in exchange, and both ways,
strengthening his interest, he took in thirty daughters from abroad for
his sons. The Jews say, Every father owes three things to his son: to
teach him to read the law, give him a trade, and get him a wife. What a
difference was there between Ibzan's family and that of his immediate
predecessor Jephthah! Ibzan has sixty children and all married, Jephthah
but one, a daughter, that dies or lives unmarried. Some are increased,
others are diminished: both are the Lord's doing.

II\. Elon of Zebulun, in the north of Canaan, was next raised up to
preside in public affairs, to administer justice, and to reform abuses.
Ten years he continued a blessing to Israel, and then died, [Jdg
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#011.md), [Jdg
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#012.md). Dr. Lightfoot computes that in
the beginning of his time the forty years' oppression by the Philistines
began (spoken of [Jdg 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#001).md), and about
that time Samson was born. Probably, his residence being in the north,
the Philistines who bordered upon the southern parts of Canaan took the
opportunity of making incursions upon them.

III\. Abdon, of the tribe of Ephraim, succeeded, and in him that
illustrious tribe begins to recover its reputation, having not afforded
any person of note since Joshua; for Abimelech the Shechemite was rather
a scandal to it. This Abdon was famous for the multitude of his
offspring (v. 14): he had forty sons and thirty grandsons, all of whom
he lived to see grown up, and they rode on seventy ass-colts either as
judges and officers or as gentlemen and persons of distinction. It was a
satisfaction to him thus to see his children's children, but it is
feared he did not see peace upon Israel, for by this time the
Philistines had begun to break in upon them. Concerning this, and the
rest of these judges that have ever so short an account given of them,
yet notice is taken where they were buried ([Jdg
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#007.md), [Jdg
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#010.md), [Jdg
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#012.md), [Jdg
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#015).md), perhaps because the
inscriptions upon their monuments (for such were anciently used, [Kg2
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#017).md) would serve for the
confirmation and enlargement of their story, and might be consulted by
such as desired further information concerning them. Peter, having
occasion to speak of David, says, His sepulchre is with us unto this
day, [Act 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#029.md). Or it is intended for
the honour of the places where they laid their bones, but may be
improved for the lessening of our esteem of all worldly glory, of which
death and the grave will stain the pride. These judges, that were as
gods to Israel, died like men, and all their honour was laid in the
dust.

It is very strange that in the history of all these judges, some of
whose actions are very particularly related, there is not so much as
once mention made of the high priest, or any other priest or Levite,
appearing either for counsel or action in any public affair, from
Phinehas ([Jdg 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#028).md) to Eli, which
may well be computed 250 years; only the names of the high priests at
that time are preserved, [Ch1 6:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#004.md);
and [Ezr 7:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#003.md). How can this strange
obscurity of that priesthood for so long a time, now in the beginning of
its days, agree with that mighty splendour with which it was introduced
and the figure which the institution of it makes in the law of Moses?
Surely it intimates that the institution was chiefly intended to be
typical, and that the great benefits that seemed to be promised by it
were to be chiefly looked for in its antitype, the everlasting
priesthood of our Lord Jesus, in comparison of the superior glory of
which that priesthood had no glory, [Co2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#010.md).
