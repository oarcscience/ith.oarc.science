### [Amos Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#001.md)

[Amos](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">amo 3:0</span></span>

A stupid, senseless, heedless people, are, in this chapter, called upon
to take notice, I. Of the judgments of God denounced against them and
the warnings he gave them of those judgments, and to be hereby awakened
out of their security ([Amo 3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#001).md).
II. Of the sins that were found among them, by which God was provoked
thus to threaten, thus to punish, that they might justify God in his
controversy with them, and, unless they repented and reformed, might
expect no other than that God should proceed in his controversy ([Amo
3:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#009).md).

[Amos 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 3:1</span></span>

The scope of these verses is to convince the people of Israel that God
had a controversy with them. That which the prophet has to say to them
is to let them know that the Lord has something to say against them,
[Amo 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#001.md). They were his peculiar
people above others, knew his name, and were called by it; nevertheless
he had something against them, and they were called to hear what it was,
that they might consider what answer they should make, as the prisoner
at the bar is told to hearken to his indictment. The children of Israel
would not regard the words of counsel and comfort that God had many a
time spoken to them, and now they shall be made to hear the word of
reproof and threatening that the Lord has spoken against them; for he
will act as he has spoken.

I. Let them know that the gracious cognizance God has taken of them, and
the favours he has bestowed upon them, should not exempt them from the
punishment due to them for their sins. Israel is a family that God
brought up out of the land of Egypt, ([Amo
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#001).md), and it was no more than a family
when it went down thither; thence God delivered it; thence he fetched it
to be a family to himself. It is not only the ten tribes, the kingdom of
Israel, that must take notice of this, but that of Judah also, for it is
spoken against the whole family that God brought up out of Egypt. It is
a family that God has bestowed distinguishing favours upon, has owned in
a peculiar manner. You only have I known of all the families of the
earth. Note, God's church in the world is a family dignified above all
the families of the earth. Those that know God are known of him. In
Judah is God known, and therefore Judah is more than any people known of
God. God has known them, that is, he has chosen them, covenanted with
them, and conversed with them as his acquaintance. Now, one would think,
it should follow, "Therefore I will spare you, will connive at your
faults, and excuse you." No: Therefore I will punish you for all your
iniquities. Note, The distinguishing favours of God to us, if they do
not serve to restrain us from sin, shall not serve to exempt us from
punishment; nay, the nearer any are to God in profession, and the kinder
notice he has taken of them, the more surely, the more quickly, and the
more severely will he reckon with them, if they by a course of wilful
sin profane their character, disgrace their relation to him, violate
their engagements, and put a slight upon the favours and honours with
which they have been distinguished. Therefore they shall be punished,
because their sins dishonour him, affront him, and grieve him, more than
the sins of others, and because it is necessary that God should
vindicate his own honour by making it appear that he hates sin and hates
it most in those that are nearest to him; if they be but as bad as
others, they shall be punished worse than others, because it is justly
expected that they should be so much better than others. Judgment begins
at the house of God, begins at the sanctuary; for God will be sanctified
either by or upon those that come nigh unto him, [Lev
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003.md).

II\. Let them know that they could not expect any comfortable communion
with God unless they first made their peace with him ([Amo
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#003).md): Can two walk together except
they be agreed? No; how should they? Where there is not friendship there
can be no fellowship; if two persons be at variance, they must first
accommodate the matters in difference between them before there can be
any interchanging of good offices. Israel has affronted God, had broken
their covenant with him, and ill-requited his favours to them; and yet
they expected that he should continue to walk with them, should take
their part, act for them, and give them assurances of his presence with
them, though they took no care by repentance and reformation to agree
with their adversary and to turn away his wrath. "But how can that be?"
says God. "While you continue to walk contrary to God you can look for
no other than that he should walk contrary to you," [Lev
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#023.md), [Lev
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#024.md). Note, We cannot expect that God
should be present with us, or act for us, unless we be reconciled to
him. God and man cannot walk together except they be agreed. Unless we
agree with God in our end, which is his glory, we cannot walk with him
by the way.

III\. Let them know that the warnings God gave them of judgments
approaching were not causeless and groundless, merely to amuse them, but
certain declarations of the wrath of God against them, which (if they
did not speedily repent) they would infallibly feel the effects of ([Amo
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#004).md): "Will a lion roar in the forest
when he has no prey in view? No: he roars upon his prey. Nor will a
young lion cry out of his den if the old lion have taken nothing to
bring home to him; nor would God thus give you warning both by the
threatenings of his word, and by less judgments, if you had not by your
sins made yourselves a prey to his wrath, nor if he were not really
about to fall upon you with desolating destroying judgments." Note, The
threatenings of the word and providence of God are not bugbears, to
frighten children and fools, but are certain inferences from the sin of
man and certain presages of the judgments of God.

IV\. Let them know that, as their own wickedness was the procuring cause
of these judgments, so they shall not be removed till they have done
their work, [Amo 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#005.md). When God has
come forth to contend with a sinful people it is necessary that they
should understand, 1. That it is their own sin that has entangled them;
for can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth where no gin is for him?
No, nature does not lay snares for the creatures, but the art of men; a
bird is not taken in a snare by chance, but with the fowler's design; so
the providence of God prepares trouble for sinners, and it is in the
work of their own hands that they are snared. Affliction does not spring
out of the dust, but it is God's justice, and our own wickedness, that
correct us. 2. It is nothing but their own repentance that can
disentangle them; for shall one take up a snare from the earth, which he
laid with design, except he have taken something as he designed? So
neither will God remove the affliction he has sent till it have done its
work and accomplished that for which he sent it. If our hearts be duly
humbled, and we are brought by our afflictions to confess and forsake
our sins, then the snare has taken something, then the point is gained,
the end is answered, and then, and not till then, the snare is broken,
is taken up from the earth, and we are delivered in love and mercy.

V. Let them know that all their troubles came from the hand of God's
providence and from the counsel of his will ([Amo
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#006).md): Shall there be evil in a city,
in a family, in a nation, and the Lord has not done it, appointed it,
and performed what he appointed? The evil of sin is from ourselves; it
is our own doing. But the evil of trouble, personal or public, is from
God, and is his doing; whoever are the instruments, God is the principal
agent. Out of his mouth both evil and good proceed. This consideration,
that, whatever evil is in the city, the Lord has done it, should engage
us patiently to bear our share in public calamities and to study to
answer God's intention in them.

VI\. Let them know that their prophets, who give them warning of
judgments approaching, deliver nothing to them but what they have
received from the Lord to be delivered to his people. 1. God makes it
known beforehand to the prophets ([Amo
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#007).md): Surely the Lord Jehovah will do
nothing, none of that evil in the city spoken of ([Amo
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#006).md), but he reveals it to his
servants the prophets, though to others it is a secret. Therefore those
know not what they do who make light of the warnings which the prophets
give them, in God's name. Observe, God's prophets are his servants, whom
he employs to go on his errands to the children of men. The secret of
God is with them; it is in some sense with all the righteous ([Pro
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#032).md), with all that fear God ([Psa
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#014).md), but in a peculiar manner with
the prophets, to whom the Spirit of prophecy is a Spirit of revelation.
It would have put honour enough upon prophets if it had been only said
that sometimes God is pleased to reveal to his prophets what he designs
to do, but it speaks something very great to say that he does nothing
but what he reveals to them, as if they were the men of his counsel.
Shall I hide from Abraham, who is a prophet, the thing which I do? [Gen
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#017.md). God will therefore be sure to
reckon with those that put contempt on the prophets, whom he puts this
honour upon. 2. The prophets cannot but make that known to the people
which God has made known to them ([Amo
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#008).md): The Lord God has spoken; who can
but prophesy? His prophets, to whom he has spoken in secret by dreams
and visions, cannot but speak in public to the people what they have
heard from God. They are so full of those things themselves, so well
assured concerning them, and so much affected with them, that they
cannot but speak of them; for out of the abundance of the heart the
mouth will speak. I believed; therefore have I spoken, [Act
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#020.md). Nay, and besides the prophetic
impulse which went along with the inspiration, and made the word like a
fire in their bones ([Jer 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#009).md), they
received a command from God to deliver what they had been charged with;
and they would have been false to their trust if they had not done it.
Necessity was laid upon them, as upon the preachers of the gospel, [Co1
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#016.md).

VII\. Let them know that they ought to tremble before God upon the fair
warning he had given them, as they would, 1. Upon the sounding of a
trumpet, to give notice of the approach of the enemy, that all may stand
upon their guard and stand to their arms: Shall a trumpet be blown in
the city, and the people be not afraid, or run together? so some read
it, [Amo 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#006.md). Will they not
immediately come together in a fright, to consider what is best to be
done for the common safety? Yet when God by his prophets gives them
notice of their danger, and summons them to come and enlist themselves
under his banner, it makes no impression; they will sooner give credit
to a watchman on their walls than to a prophet sent of God, will sooner
obey the summons of the governor of their city than the orders given
them by the Governor of the world. God says, Hearken to the voice of the
trumpet; but they will not hearken, nay, and they tell him plainly that
they will not, [Jer 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#017.md). 2. Upon the
roaring of a lion. God is sometimes as a lion, and a young lion, to the
house of Judah, [Hos 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#014.md). The lion
roars before he tears; thus God warns before he wounds. If therefore the
lion roars upon a poor traveller (as he did against Samson, [Jdg
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#005).md), he cannot but be put into great
consternation; yet the Lord roars out of Zion ([Amo
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#002).md), and none are afraid, but they go
on securely as if they were in no danger. Note, The fair warning given
to a careless world, if it be not taken, will aggravate its condemnation
another day. The lion roared, and they were not moved with fear to
prepare an ark. O the amazing stupidity of an unbelieving world, that
will not be wrought upon, no, not by the terrors of the Lord!

[Amos 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 3:9</span></span>

The Israelites are here again convicted and condemned, and particular
notice given of the crimes they are convicted of and the punishment they
are condemned to.

1\. Notice is given of it to their neighbours. The prophet is ordered to
publish it in the palaces of Ashdod, one of the chief cities of the
Philistines; nay, the summons must go further, even to the palaces in
the land of Egypt. "The great men of both those nations, that dwell in
the palaces, that are inquisitive concerning the affairs of the
neighboring nations, and are conversant with the public intelligence,
let them assemble themselves upon the mountains of Samaria," [Amo
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#009.md). There, upon a throne high and
lifted up, the judgment is set. Samaria is the criminal that is to be
tried; let them be present at the trial, for it shall be (as other
trials are) public, in the face of the country; let them make an
appointment to meet there from all parts, to judge between God and his
vineyard. God appeals to all impartial righteous men, [Eze
23:45](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#045.md). They will all subscribe to the
equity of his proceedings when they see how the case stands. Note, God's
controversies with sinners do not fear a scrutiny; even Philistines and
Egyptians will be made to see, and say, that the ways of the Lord are
equal, but our ways are unequal. They are likewise summoned to attend,
not only that they may justify God and be witness for him that he deals
fairly, but that they may themselves take warning; for, if judgment
begin at the house of God, as they see it does, what shall be the end of
those that are strangers to him? [Pe1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017.md). If this be done in a green tree,
what shall be done in a dry? Or this intimates that the sin of Israel
had been so notorious that the neighboring nations could come in
witnesses against them, and therefore it was fit that their punishment
should be so. "If it could have been concealed, we would have said, Tell
it not in Gath; publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon;" but why
should their friends consult their reputation, when they themselves do
not consult it? If they have grown impudent in sin, let them bear the
shame: "Publish it in Ashdod, in Egypt."

1\. Let them see how black the charge is, and how well proved. Let them
observe the behaviour of the inhabitants of Samaria; let them look off
from the adjacent hills, and they may see how rude and boisterous they
are, and hear how loud they cry of their sin is, as was that of Sodom.
(1.) Look into their streets and you will see nothing but riot and
disorder, great tumults in the midst thereof; reason and justice are
upon all occasions run down by the noise and fury of an outrageous mob,
the dominion of which is the sin and shame of any people, and is likely
to be their ruin. (2.) Look into their prisons, and you will see them
filled with injured innocents: The oppressed are in the midst thereof,
thrown down and crushed by their oppressors, overpowered and
overwhelmed, and they had no comforter, [Ecc
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001). (3..md) Look into their courts of
justice, and you will see that those who preside in those courts know
not to do right, because they have always been accustomed to do wrong;
they act as if they had no notion at all of the thing called justice,
are in no care to do justice themselves nor to see that others do
justice. (4.) Look into their treasures and stores, and you will see
them replenished with violence and robbery, with that which was unjustly
got and is still unjustly kept. Thus they have heaped treasures together
for the last days, but it will prove a treasure of wrath against the day
of wrath. It may well be said, Those know not to do right who think to
enrich themselves by doing wrong.

2\. Let them see how heavy the doom is, and how well executed, [Amo
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#011.md), [Amo
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#012.md).

(1.) Their country shall be invaded and ruined; and observe how the
punishment answers to the sin. \[1.\] Great tumults are in the midst of
the land, and therefore an adversary shall be even round about the land;
the Assyrian forces shall surround it and break in upon it on every
side. Note, When sin is harboured and indulged in the midst of a people
they can expect no other than that adversaries should be round about
them, so that, go which way they will, they go into the mouth of danger,
[Luk 19:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#043.md). \[2.\] They strengthened
themselves in their wickedness, but the enemy shall bring down their
strength from them, that strength which they abused in oppressing the
poor, and doing violence to all about them. Note, That power which is
made an instrument of unrighteousness will justly be brought down and
broken. \[3.\] They stored up robbery in their palaces, and therefore
their palaces shall be spoiled; for what is got and kept wrongfully will
not be kept long. Even palaces will be no protection to fraud and
oppression; but the greatest of men, if they have spoiled others, shall
themselves be spoiled, for the Lord is the avenger of all such.

(2.) Their countrymen shall not escape, [Amo
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#012.md). They shall be in the hands of
the enemy, as a lamb in the mouth of a lion, all devoured and eaten up,
and they shall be utterly unable to make an resistance; and if any do
make their escape, so as neither to fall by the sword or go into
captivity, yet they shall be very few, and those of the meanest and
least considerable, like two legs, or shanks, of a lamb, or, it may be,
a piece of an ear, which the lion drops, or the shepherd takes from him,
when he has eaten the whole body; so, perhaps, here and there one may
escape from Samaria and from Damascus, when the king of Assyria shall
fall upon them both, but none to make any account of; and those that do
escape shall do so with the utmost difficult and hazard, by hiding
themselves in the corner of a bed or under the bed's feet, which
intimates that their spirits shall sneak shamefully in the time of
danger. They shall not hide themselves in dens and caves, but in the
corner of a bed, or the piece of a bed, such as poor people must be
content with. They shall very narrowly escape, as it is foretold
concerning the last destruction of Jerusalem that there shall be two in
a bed together, one taken and the other left. Note, When God's judgments
come forth against a people with commission it will be in vain to think
of escaping them. Some make their dwelling in the corner of a bed, and
in a couch, to denote their present security and sensuality; they are at
ease, as in a bed, or on a couch, but, when God comes to contend with
them, he shall make them uneasy, shall take them away out of the bed of
their sloth and slumber. Those that stretch themselves lazily upon their
couches when God's judgments are abroad shall go captive with the first
that go captive.

II\. Notice is given of it to themselves, [Amo
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#013.md). Let this be testified, and
heard, in the house of Jacob, among all the seed of Israel, for it is
spoken by the Lord God, the God of hosts, who has authority to pass this
sentence and ability to execute it; let them know from him that the day
is at hand when God will visit the transgressions of Israel upon him,
when he will enquire into them and reckon for them: there will come a
day of visitation, a day of punishment, and in that day all those things
they are proud of, and put confidence in, shall fail them, and so they
shall smart for the sins they have been guilty of about them. 1. Woe to
their altars, for God will visit them. He will enquire into the sins
they have been guilty of at their altars, and bring into the account all
their superstition and idolatry, all their expenses on their false gods,
and all their expectations from them; and he will lay the altars
themselves under the marks of his displeasure, for the horns of the
altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground, and with them the altar
itself demolished and broken to pieces. We find the altar at Bethel
prophesied against ([Kg1 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#002).md), and
immediately rent ([Amo 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#003).md), and that
prophecy fulfilled with Josiah burnt men's bones upon it, [Kg2
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#015.md), [Kg2
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#016.md). This seconds that prophecy, and
seems to point at the same event. Note, If men will not destroy
idolatrous altars, God will, and those with them that had them in
veneration. Some make the horns of the altar to signify all those things
which they flee to for refuge, and trust in, and which they make their
sanctuary: they shall all be cut off, so that they shall have nothing to
take hold of. 2. Woe to their houses, for God will visit them too. He
will enquire into the sins they have been guilty of in their houses, the
robbery that have stored up in their houses, and the luxury in which
they lived: and I will smite the winter-house with the summer-house,
[Amo 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#015.md). Their nobility, and gentry,
and rich merchants, had their winter-houses in the city and their
summer-houses in the country, so nice were they in guarding against the
inconveniences of the winter when the country was thought too cold, and
of the summer when the city was thought too hot, though the climate of
that good land was so temperate, like that of ours, that neither the
cold nor heat was ever in extremity. They indulged a foolish affectation
of change and variety; but God will, either by war or by the earthquake,
smite both the winter-house and the summer-house; neither shall serve to
shelter them from his judgments. The houses of ivory (so called because
the ceiling, or wainscot, or some of the ornaments of them, were edged
or inlaid with ivory) shall perish, shall be burnt or pulled down; and
the great houses shall have an end; the most splendid and spacious
houses, the houses of their great men, shall no longer be, or at least
be no longer theirs. Note, The pomp or pleasantness of men's houses will
be so far from fortifying them against God's judgments that it will make
them the more grievous and vexatious, as their extravagance about them
will be put to the score of their sins and follies.
