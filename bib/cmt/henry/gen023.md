### [Genesis Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 23:0</span></span>

Here is, I. Abraham a mourner for the death of Sarah ([Gen
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#001.md), [Gen
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#002).md). II. Abraham a purchaser of a
burying-place for Sarah. 1. The purchase humbly proposed by Abraham
([Gen 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#003.md), [Gen
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#004).md). 2. Fairly treated of, and
agreed to, with a great deal of mutual civility and respect ([Gen
23:5-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#005).md). 3. The purchase-money paid
([Gen 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#016).md). 4. The premises conveyed
and secured to Abraham ([Gen 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#017.md),
[Gen 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#018.md), [Gen
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#020).md). 5. Sarah's funeral ([Gen
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#019).md).

[Genesis 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 23:1</span></span>

We have here, 1. Sarah's age, [Gen
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#001.md). Almost forty years before, she
had called herself old, [Gen 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#012.md).
Old people will die never the sooner, but may die the better, for
reckoning themselves old. 2. Her death, [Gen
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#002.md). The longest liver must die at
last. Abraham and Sarah had lived comfortably together many years; but
death parts those whom nothing else could part. The special friends and
favourites of Heaven are not exempted from the stroke of death. She died
in the land of Canaan, where she had been above sixty years a sojourner.
3. Abraham's mourning for her; and he was a true mourner. He did not
only perform the ceremonies of mourning according to the custom of those
time, as the mourners that go about the streets, but he did sincerely
lament the great loss he had of a good wife, and gave proof of the
constancy of his affection to her to the last. Two words are used: he
came both to mourn and to weep. His sorrow was not counterfeit, but
real. He came to her tent, and sat down by the corpse, there to pay the
tribute of his tears, that his eye might affect his heart, and that he
might pay the greater respect to the memory of her that was gone. Note,
It is not only lawful, but it is a duty, to lament the death of our near
relations, both in compliance with the providence of God, who thus calls
to weeping and mourning, and in honour to those to whom honour is due.
Tears are a tribute due to our deceased friends. When a body is sown, it
must be watered. But we must not sorrow as those that have no hope; for
we have a good hope through grace both concerning them and concerning
ourselves.

[Genesis 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 23:3</span></span>

Here is, I. The humble request which Abraham made to his neighbours, the
Hittites, for a burying-place among them, [Gen
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#003.md), [Gen
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#004.md). It was strange he had this to do
now; but we are to impute it rather to God's providence than to his
improvidence, as appears [Act 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#005.md),
where it is said, God gave him no inheritance in Canaan. It were well if
all those who take care to provide burying-places for their bodies after
death were as careful to provide a resting-place for their souls.
Observe here, 1. The convenient diversion which this affair gave, for
the present, to Abraham's grief: He stood up from before his dead. Those
that find themselves in danger of over-grieving for their dead
relations, and are entering into that temptation, must take heed of
poring upon their loss and sitting alone and melancholy. There must be a
time of standing up from before their dead, and ceasing to mourn. For,
thanks be to God, our happiness is not bound up in the life of any
creature. Care of the funeral may, as here, be improved to divert grief
for the death at first, when it is most in danger of tyrannizing.
Weeping must not hinder sowing. 2. The argument he used with the
children of Heth, which was this: "I am a stranger and a sojourner with
you, therefore I am unprovided, and must become a humble suitor to you
for a burying-place." This was one occasion which Abraham took to
confess that he was a stranger and a pilgrim upon earth; he was not
ashamed to own it thus publicly, [Heb
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013.md). Note, The death of our
relations should effectually remind us that we are not at home in this
world. When they are gone, say, "We are going." 3. His uneasiness till
this affair was settled, intimated in that word, that I may bury my dead
out of my sight. Note, Death will make those unpleasant to our sight who
while they lived were the desire of our eyes. The countenance that was
fresh and lively becomes pale and ghastly, and fit to be removed into
the land of darkness. While she was in his sight, it renewed his grief,
which he would prevent.

II\. The generous offer which the children of Heth made to him, [Gen
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#005.md), [Gen
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#006.md). They compliment him, 1. With a
title of respect: Thou art a prince of God among us, so the word is; not
only great, but good. He called himself a stranger and a sojourner; they
call him a great prince; for those that humble themselves shall be
exalted. God had promised to make Abraham's name great. 2. With a tender
of the best of their burying-places. Note, Even the light of nature
teaches us to be civil and respectful towards all, though they be
strangers and sojourners. The noble generosity of these Canaanites
shames and condemns the closeness, and selfishness, and ill-humour, of
many that call themselves Israelites. Observe, These Canaanites would be
glad to mingle their dust with Abraham's and to have their last end like
his.

III\. The particular proposal which Abraham made to them, [Gen
23:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#007.md). He returns them his thanks for
their kind offer with all possible decency and respect; though a great
man, an old man, and now a mourner, yet he stands up, and bows himself
humbly before them, [Gen 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#007.md). Note,
Religion teaches good manners; and those abuse it that place it in
rudeness and clownishness. He then pitches upon the place he thinks most
convenient, namely, the cave of Machpelah, which probably lay near him,
and had not yet been used for a burying-place. The present owner was
Ephron. Abraham cannot pretend to any interest in him, but he desires
that they would improve theirs with him to get the purchase of that
cave, and the field in which it was. Note, A moderate desire to obtain
that which is convenient for us, by fair and honest means, is not such a
coveting of that which is our neighbour's as is forbidden in the tenth
commandment.

IV\. The present which Ephron made to Abraham of his field: The field
give I thee, [Gen 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#010.md), [Gen
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#011.md). Abraham thought he must be
entreated to sell it; but, upon the first mention of it, without
entreaty, Ephron freely gives it. Some men have more generosity than
they are thought to have. Abraham, no doubt, had taken all occasions to
oblige his neighbours, and do them any service that lay in his power;
and now they return his kindness: for he that watereth shall be watered
also himself. Note, If those that profess religion adorn their
profession by eminent civility and serviceableness to all, they shall
find it will rebound to their own comfort and advantage, as well as to
the glory of God.

V. Abraham's modest and sincere refusal of Ephron's kind offer, [Gen
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#012.md), [Gen
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#013.md). Abundance of thanks he returns
him for it ([Gen 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#012).md), makes his
obeisance to him before the people of the land, that they might respect
Ephron the more for the respect they saw Abraham give him ([Sa1
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#030).md), but resolves to give him money
for the field, even the full value of it. It was not in pride that
Abraham refused the gift, or because he scorned to be beholden to
Ephron; but, 1. In justice. Abraham was rich in silver and gold ([Gen
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#002).md) and was able to pay for the
field, and therefore would not take advantage of Ephron's generosity.
Note, Honesty, as well as honour, forbids us to sponge upon our
neighbours and to impose upon those that are free. Job reflected upon it
with comfort, when he was poor, that he had not eaten the fruits of his
land without money, [Job 31:39](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#039.md). 2. In
prudence. He would pay for it lest Ephron, when this good humour was
over, should upbraid him with it, and say, I have made Abraham rich
([Gen 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#023).md), or lest the next heir
should question Abraham's title (because that grant was made without any
consideration), and claim back the field. Thus David afterwards refused
Araunah's offer, [Sa2 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#024.md). We know
not what affronts we may hereafter receive from those that are now most
kind and generous.

VI\. The price of the land fixed by Ephron but not insisted on: The land
is worth four hundred shekels of silver (about fifty pounds of our
money), but what is that between me and thee? [Gen
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#014.md), [Gen
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#015.md). He would rather oblige his
friend than have so much money in his pocket. Herein Ephron discovers,
1. A great contempt of worldly wealth. "What is that between me and
thee? It is a small matter, not worth speaking of." Many a one would
have said, "It is a deal of money; it will go far in a child's portion."
But Ephron says, "What is that?" Note, It is an excellent thing for
people to have low and mean thoughts of all the wealth of this world; it
is that which is not, and in the abundance of which a man's life does
not consist, [Luk 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#015.md). 2. Great
courtesy, and obligingness to his friend and neighbour. Ephron was not
jealous of Abraham as a resident foreigner, nor envious at him as a man
likely to thrive and grow rich. He bore him no ill-will for his
singularity in religion, but was much kinder to him than most people
now-a-days are to their own brothers: What is that between me and thee?
Note, No little thing should occasion demurs and differences between
true friends. When we are tempted to be hot in resenting affronts, high
in demanding our rights, or hard in denying a kindness, we should answer
the temptation with this question: "What is that between me and my
friend?"

[Genesis 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 23:16</span></span>

We have here the conclusion of the treaty between Abraham and Ephron
about the burying-place. The bargain was publicly made before all the
neighbours, in the presence and audience of the sons of Heth, [Gen
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#016.md), [Gen
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#017.md). Note, Prudence, as well as
justice, directs us to be fair, and open, and above-board, in our
dealings. Fraudulent contracts hate the light, and choose to be
clandestine; but those that design honestly in their bargains care not
who are witnesses to them. Our law countenances sales made in market -
overt, and by deed enrolled. Observe, 1. Abraham, without fraud, covin,
or further delay, pays the money, [Gen
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#016.md). He pays it readily, without
hesitation, - pays it in full, without diminution, - and pays it by
weight, current money with the merchant, without deceit. See how
anciently money was used for the help of commerce; and see how honestly
money should be paid where it is due. Observe, Though all the land of
Canaan was Abraham's by promise, yet, the time of his possessing not
having come, what he had now occasion for he bought and paid for. Note,
Dominion is not founded in grace. The saints' title to an eternal
inheritance does not entitle them to the possessions of this world, nor
justify them in doing wrong. 2. Ephron honestly and fairly makes him a
good title to the land, [Gen 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#017.md),
[Gen 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#018.md), [Gen
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#020.md). The field, with all its
appurtenances, is conveyed to Abraham and his heirs for ever, in open
court, not by writing (it does not appear that writing was then used),
but by such a public solemn declaration before witnesses as was
sufficient to pass it. Note, As that which is bought must be honestly
paid for, so that which is sold must be honestly paid for, so that which
is sold must be honestly delivered and secured. 3. Abraham, thereupon,
takes possession, and buries Sarah in the cave or vault (whether framed
by nature or art is not certain) which was in the purchased field. It is
probable that Abraham had buried servants out of his family since he
came to Canaan, but the graves of the common people ([Kg2
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#006).md) might suffice for them; now that
Sarah was dead a peculiar place must be found for her remains. It is
worth noting, (1.) That a burying-place was the first spot of ground
Abraham possessed in Canaan. Note, When we are entering into the world
it is good to think of our going out of it; for, as soon as we are born,
we begin to die. (2.) That it was the only piece of land he ever
possessed, though the country was all his own in reversion. Those that
have least of this earth find a grave in it. Abraham provided, not
cities, as Cain and Nimrod, but a sepulchre, \[1.\] To be a constant
memorandum of death to himself and his posterity, that he and they might
learn to die daily. This sepulchre is said to be at the end of the field
([Gen 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#009).md); for, whatever our
possessions are, there is a sepulchre at the end of them. \[2.\] To be a
token of his belief and expectation of the resurrection; for why should
such care be taken of the body if it be thrown away for ever, and must
not rise again? Abraham, in this, said plainly that he sought a better
country, that is, a heavenly. Abraham is content to be still flitting,
while he lives, but secures a place where, when he dies his flesh may
rest in hope.
