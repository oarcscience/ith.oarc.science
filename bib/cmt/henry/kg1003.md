### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg1 3:0</span></span>

Solomon's reign looked bloody in the foregoing chapter, but the
necessary acts of justice must not be called cruelty; in this chapter it
appears with another face. We must not think the worse of God's mercy to
his subjects for his judgments on rebels. We have here, I. Solomon's
marriage to Pharaoh's daughter ([Kg1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001).md). II. A general view of his
religion ([Kg1 3:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#002).md). III. A
particular account of his prayer to God for wisdom, and the answer to
that prayer ([Kg1 3:5-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005).md). IV. A
particular instance of his wisdom in deciding the controversy between
the two harlots ([Kg1 3:16-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#016).md). And
very great he looks here, both at the altar and on the bench, and
therefore on the bench because at the altar.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 3:1</span></span>

We are here told concerning Solomon,

I. Something that was unquestionably good, for which he is to be praised
and in which he is to be imitated. 1. He loved the Lord, [Kg1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#003.md). Particular notice was taken of
God's love to him, [Sa2 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#024.md). He had
his name from it: Jedidiah - beloved of the Lord. And here we find he
returned that love, as John, the beloved disciple, was most full of
love. Solomon was a wise man, a rich man; yet the brightest encomium of
him is that which is the character of all the saints, even the poorest,
He loved the Lord, so the Chaldee; all that love God love his worship,
love to hear from him and speak to him, and so to have communion with
him. 2. He walked in the statutes of David his father, that is, in the
statutes that David gave him, [Kg1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#002.md), [Kg1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#003.md); [Ch1
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#009.md), [Ch1
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#010.md) (his dying father's charge was
sacred, and as a law to him), or in God's statutes, which David his
father walked in before him; he kept close to God's ordinances,
carefully observed them and diligently attended them. Those that truly
love God will make conscience of walking in his statutes. 3. He was very
free and generous in what he did for the honour of God. When he offered
sacrifice he offered like a king, in some proportion to his great
wealth, a thousand burnt-offerings, [Kg1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004.md). Where God sows plentifully he
expects to reap accordingly; and those that truly love God and his
worship will not grudge the expenses of their religion. We may be
tempted to say, To what purpose is this waste? Might not these cattle
have been given to the poor? But we must never think that wasted which
is laid out in the service of God. It seems strange how so many beasts
should be burnt upon one altar in one feast, though it continued seven
days; but the fire on the altar is supposed to be more quick and
devouring than common fire, for it represented that fierce and mighty
wrath of God which fell upon the sacrifices, that the offerers might
escape. Our God is a consuming fire. Bishop Patrick quotes it as a
tradition of the Jews that the smoke of the sacrifices ascended directly
in a straight pillar, and was not scattered, otherwise it would have
choked those that attended, when so many sacrifices were offered as were
here.

II\. Here is something concerning which it may be doubted whether it was
good or no. 1. His marrying Pharaoh's daughter, [Kg1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001.md). We will suppose she was
proselyted, otherwise the marriage would not have been lawful; yet, if
so, surely it was not advisable. He that loved the Lord should, for his
sake, have fixed his love upon one of the Lord's people. Unequal matches
of the sons of God with the daughters of men have often been of
pernicious consequence; yet some think that he did this with the advice
of his friends, that she was a sincere convert (for the gods of the
Egyptians are not reckoned among the strange gods which his strange
wives drew him in to the worship of, [Kg1
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#005.md), [Kg1
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#006).md), and that the book of Canticles
and the 45th Psalm were penned on this occasion, by which these nuptials
were made typical of the mystical espousals of the church to Christ,
especially the Gentile church. 2. His worshipping in the high places,
and thereby tempting the people to do so too, [Kg1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#002.md), [Kg1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#003.md). Abraham built his altars on
mountains ([Gen 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008.md); [Gen
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#002).md), and worshipped in a grove, [Gen
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#033.md). Thence the custom was derived,
and was proper, till the divine law confined them to one place, [Deu
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005.md), [Deu
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#006.md). David kept to the ark, and did
not care for the high places, but Solomon, though in other things he
walked in the statutes of his father, in this came short of him. He
showed thereby a great zeal for sacrificing, but to obey would have been
better. This was an irregularity. Though there was as yet no house
built, there was a tent pitched, to the name of the Lord, and the ark
ought to have been the centre of their unity. It was so by divine
institution; from it the high places separated; yet while they
worshipped God only, and in other things according to the rule, he
graciously overlooked their weakness, and accepted their services; and
it is owned that Solomon loved the Lord, though he burnt incense in the
high places, and let not men be more severe than God is.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 3:5</span></span>

We have here an account of a gracious visit which God paid to Solomon,
and the communion he had with God in it, which put a greater honour upon
Solomon than all the wealth and power of his kingdom did.

I. The circumstances of this visit, [Kg1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005.md). 1. The place. It was in Gibeon;
that was the great high place, and should have been the only one,
because there the tabernacle and the brazen altar were, [Ch2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#003.md). There Solomon offered his great
sacrifices, and there God owned him more than in any other of the high
places. The nearer we come to the rule in our worship the more reason we
have to expect the tokens of God's presence. Where God records his name,
there he will meet us and bless us. 2. The time. It was by night, the
night after he had offered that generous sacrifice, [Kg1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004.md). The more we abound in God's work
the more comfort we may expect in him; if the day has been busy for him,
the night will be easy in him. Silence and retirement befriend our
communion with God. His kindest visits are often in the night, [Psa
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003.md). 3. The manner. It was in a
dream, when he was asleep, his senses locked up, that God's access to
his mind might be the more free and immediate. In this way God used to
speak to the prophets ([Num 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006).md) and
to private persons, for their own benefit, [Job
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#015.md), [Job
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#016.md). These divine dreams, no doubt,
were plainly distinguishable from those in which there are divers
vanities, [Ecc 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#007.md).

II\. The gracious offer God made him of the favour he should choose,
whatever it might be, [Kg1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005.md). He saw
the glory of God shine about him, and heard a voice saying, Ask what I
shall give thee. Not that God was indebted to him for his sacrifices,
but thus he would testify his acceptance of them, and signify to him
what great mercy he had in store for him, if he were not wanting to
himself. Thus he would try his inclinations and put an honour upon the
prayer of faith. God, in like manner, condescends to us, and puts us in
the ready way to be happy by assuring us that we shall have what we will
for the asking, [Joh 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#023.md); [Jo1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014.md). What would we more? Ask, and it
shall be given you.

III\. The pious request Solomon hereupon made to God. He readily laid
hold of this offer. Why do we neglect the like offer made to us, like
Ahaz, who said, I will not ask? [Isa
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#012.md). Solomon prayed in his sleep,
God's grace assisting him; yet it was a lively prayer. What we are most
in care about, and which makes the greatest impression upon us when we
are awake, commonly affects us when we are asleep; and by our dreams,
sometimes, we may know what our hearts are upon and how our pulse beats.
Plutarch makes virtuous dreams one evidence of increase in virtue. Yet
this must be attributed to a higher source. Solomon's making such an
intelligent choice as this when he was asleep, and the powers of reason
were least active, showed that it came purely from the grace of God,
which wrought in him these gracious desires. If his reins thus instruct
him in the night season, he must bless the Lord who gave him counsel,
[Psa 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#007.md). Now, in this prayer,

1\. He acknowledges God's great goodness to his father David, [Kg1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#006.md). He speaks honourably of his
father's piety, that he had walked before God in uprightness of heart,
drawing a veil over his faults. It is to be hoped that those who praise
their godly parents will imitate them. But he speaks more honourably of
God's goodness to his father, the mercy he had shown to him while he
lived, in giving him to be sincerely religious and then recompensing his
sincerity and the great kindness he had kept for him, to be bestowed on
the family when he was gone, in giving him a son to sit on his throne.
Children should give God thanks for his mercies to their parents, for
the sure mercies of David. God's favours are doubly sweet when we
observe them transmitted to us through the hands of those that have gone
before us. The way to get the entail perpetuated is to bless God that it
has hitherto been preserved.

2\. He owns his own insufficiency for the discharge of that great trust
to which he is called, [Kg1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#007.md), [Kg1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#008.md). And here is a double plea to
enforce his petition for wisdom: - (1.) That his place required it, as
he was successor to David ("Thou hast made me king instead of David, who
was a very wise and good man: Lord, give me wisdom, that I may keep up
what he wrought, and carry on what he began") and as he was ruler over
Israel: "Lord, give me wisdom to rule well; for they are a numerous
people, that will not be managed without much care, and they are thy
people, whom thou hast chosen, and therefore to be ruled for thee, and
the more wisely they are ruled the more glory thou wilt have from them."
(2.) That he wanted it. As one that had a humble sense of his own
deficiency, he pleads, "Lord, I am but a little child (so he calls
himself, a child in understanding, though his father called him a wise
man, [Kg1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#009).md); I know not how to go
out or come in as I should, nor to do so much as the common daily
business of the government, much less what to do in a critical
juncture." Note, Those who are employed in public stations ought to be
very sensible of the weight and importance of their work and their own
insufficiency for it, and then they are qualified for receiving divine
instruction. Paul's question (Who is sufficient for these things?) is
much like Solomon's here, Who is able to judge this thy so great a
people? [Kg1 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#009.md). Absalom, who was a
wise man, trembles at the undertaking and suspects his own fitness for
it. The more knowing and considerate men are the better acquainted they
are with their own weakness and the more jealous of themselves.

3\. He begs of God to give him wisdom ([Kg1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#009).md); Give therefore thy servant an
understanding heart. He calls himself God's servant, pleased with that
relation to God ([Psa 116:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#016).md) and
pleading it with him: "I am devoted to thee, and employed for thee; give
me that which is requisite to the services in which I am employed." Thus
his good father prayed, and thus he pleaded. [Psa
119:125](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#125.md), I am thy servant, give me
understanding. An understanding heart is God's gift, [Pro
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#006.md). We must pray for it ([Jam
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005).md), and pray for it with application
to our particular calling and the various occasions we have for it; as
Solomon, Give me an understanding, not to please my own curiosity with,
or puzzle my neighbours, but to judge thy people. That is the best
knowledge which will be serviceable to us in doing our duty; and such
that knowledge is which enables us to discern between good and bad,
right and wrong, sin and duty, truth and falsehood, so as not to be
imposed upon by false colours in judging either of others' actions or of
our own.

4\. The favourable answer God gave to his request. It was a pleasing
prayer ([Kg1 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#010).md): The speech pleased
the Lord. God is well pleased with his own work in his people, the
desires of his own kindling, the prayers of his Spirit's inditing. By
this choice Solomon made it appear that he desired to be good more than
great, and to serve God's honour more than to advance his own. Those are
accepted of God who prefer spiritual blessings to temporal, and are more
solicitous to be found in the way of their duty than in the way to
preferment. But that was not all; it was a prevailing prayer, and
prevailed for more than he asked. (1.) God gave him wisdom, [Kg1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#012.md). He fitted him for all that great
work to which he had called him, gave him such a right understanding of
the law which he was to judge by, and the cases he was to judge of, that
he was unequalled for a clear head, a solid judgment, and a piercing
eye. Such an insight, and such a foresight, never was prince so blessed
with. (2.) He gave him riches and honour over and above into the bargain
([Kg1 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#013).md), and it was promised that
in these he should as much exceed his predecessors, his successors, and
all his neighbours, as in wisdom. These also are God's gift, and, as far
as is good for them, are promised to all that seek first the kingdom of
God and the righteousness thereof, [Mat
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033.md). Let young people learn to prefer
grace to gold in all that they choose, because godliness has the promise
of the life that now is, but the life that now is has not the promise of
godliness. How completely blessed was Solomon, that had both wisdom and
wealth! He that has wealth and power without wisdom and grace is in
danger of doing hurt with them; he that has wisdom and grace without
wealth and power is not capable of doing so much good with them as he
that has both. Wisdom is good, is so much the better, with an
inheritance, [Ecc 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#011.md). But, if we
make sure of wisdom and grace, these will either bring outward
prosperity with them or sweeten the want of it. God promised Solomon
riches and honour absolutely, but long life upon condition ([Kg1
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#014).md). If thou wilt walk in my ways,
as David did, then I will lengthen thy days. He failed in the condition;
and therefore, though he had riches and honour, he did not live so long
to enjoy them as in the course of nature he might have done. Length of
days is wisdom's right-hand blessing, typical of eternal life; but it is
in her left hand that riches and honour are, [Pro
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#016.md). Let us see here, \[1.\] That the
way to obtain spiritual blessings is to be importunate for them, to
wrestle with God in prayer for them, as Solomon did for wisdom, asking
that only, as the one thing needful. \[2.\] That the way to obtain
temporal blessings is to be indifferent to them and to refer ourselves
to God concerning them. Solomon had wisdom given him because he did ask
it and wealth because he did not ask it.

5\. The grateful return Solomon made for the visit God was pleased to
pay him, [Kg1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#015.md). He awoke, we may
suppose in a transport of joy, awoke, and his sleep was sweet to him, as
the prophet speaks ([Jer 31:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#026).md); being
satisfied of God's favour, he was satisfied with it, and he began to
think what he should render to the Lord. He had made his prayer at the
high place at Gibeon, and there God had graciously met him; but he comes
to Jerusalem to give thanks before the ark of the covenant, blaming
himself, as it were, that he had not prayed there, the ark being the
token of God's presence, and wondering that God had met him any where
else. God's passing by our mistakes should persuade us to amend them.
There he, (1.) Offered a great sacrifice to God. We must give God praise
for his gifts in the promise, though not yet fully performed. David used
to praise God's word, as well as his works ([Psa
56:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#010.md), and particularly, [Sa2
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#018).md), and Solomon trod in his steps.
(2.) He made a great feast upon the sacrifice, that those about him
might rejoice with him in the grace of God.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 3:16</span></span>

An instance is here given of Solomon's wisdom, to show that the grant
lately made him had a real effect upon him. The proof is fetched, not
from the mysteries of state and the policies of the council-board,
though there no doubt he excelled, but from the trial and determination
of a cause between party and party, which princes, though they devolve
them upon their judges, must not think it below them to take cognizance
of. Observe,

I. The case opened, not by lawyers, but by the parties themselves,
though they were women, which made it the easier to such a piercing eye
as Solomon had to discern between right and wrong by their own showing.
These two women were harlots, kept a public house, and their children,
some think, were born of fornication, because here is no mention of
their husbands. It is probable the cause had been heard in the inferior
courts, before it was brought before Solomon, and had been found
special, the judges being unable to determine it, that Solomon's wisdom
in deciding it at last might be the more taken notice of. These two
women, who lived in a house together, were each of them delivered of a
son within three days of one another, [Kg1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#017.md), [Kg1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#018.md). They were so poor that they had
no servant or nurse to be with them, so slighted, because harlots, that
they had no friend or relation to accompany them. One of them overlaid
her child, and, in the night, exchanged it with the other ([Kg1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#019.md), [Kg1
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#020).md), who was soon aware of the cheat
put upon her, and appealed to public justice to be righted, [Kg1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#021.md). See, 1. What anxiety is caused
by little children, how uncertain their lives are, and to how many
dangers they are continually exposed. The age of infancy is the valley
of the shadow of death; and the lamp of life, when first lighted, is
easily blown out. It is a wonder of mercy that so few perish in the
perils of nursing. 2. How much better it was in those times with
children born in fornication than commonly it is now. harlots then loved
their children, nursed them, and were loth to part with them; whereas
now they are often sent to a distance, abandoned, or killed. But thus is
was foretold that in the last days perilous times should come, when
people should be without natural affection, [Ti2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001.md), [Ti2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#003.md).

II\. The difficulty of the case. The question was, Who was the mother of
this living child, which was brought into court, to be finally adjudged
either to the one or to the other? Both mothers were vehement in their
claim, and showed a deep concern about it. Both were peremptory in their
asseverations: "It is mine," says one. "Nay, it is mine," says the
other. Neither will own the dead child, though it would be cheaper to
bury that than to maintain the other: but it is the living one they
strive for. The living child is therefore the parent's joy because it is
their hope; and may not the dead children be so? See [Jer
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#017.md). Now the difficulty of the case
was that there was no evidence on either side. The neighbours, though it
is probable that some of them were present at the birth and circumcision
of the children, yet had not taken so much notice of them as to be able
to distinguish them. To put the parties to the rack would have been
barbarous; not she who had justice on her side, but she who was most
hardy, would have had the judgment in her favour. Little stress is to be
laid on extorted evidence. Judges and juries have need of wisdom to find
out truth when it thus lies hid.

III\. The determination of it. Solomon, having patiently heard what both
sides had to say, sums up the evidence, [Kg1
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#023.md). And now the whole court is in
expectation what course Solomon's wisdom will take to find out the
truth. One knows not what to say to it; another, perhaps, would
determine it by lot. Solomon calls for a sword, and gives orders to
divide the living child between the two contenders. Now, 1. This seemed
a ridiculous decision of the case, and a brutal cutting of the knot
which he could not untie. "Is this," think the sages of the law, "the
wisdom of Solomon?" little dreaming what he aimed at in it. The hearts
of kings, such kings, are unsearchable, [Pro
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#003.md). There was a law concerning the
dividing of a living ox and a dead one. ([Exo
21:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#035).md), but that did not reach this
case. But, 2. It proved an effectual discovery of the truth. Some think
that Solomon did himself discern it, before he made this experiment, by
the countenances of the women and their way of speaking: but by this he
gave satisfaction to all the company, and silenced the pretender. To
find out the true mother, he could not try which the child loved best,
and must therefore try which loved the child best; both pretended to a
motherly affection, but their sincerity will be tried when the child is
in danger. (1.) She that knew the child was not her own, but in
contending for it stood upon a point of honour, was well content to have
it divided. She that had overlaid her own child cared not what became of
this, so that the true mother might not have it: Let it be neither mine
nor thine, but divide it. By this it appeared that she knew her own
title to be bad, and feared Solomon would find it so, though she little
suspected she was betraying herself, but thought Solomon in good
earnest. If she had been the true mother she would not have forfeited
her interest in the child by agreeing so readily to this bloody
decision. But, (2.) She that knew the child was her own, rather than the
child should be butchered, gives it up to her adversary. How feelingly
does she cry out, O, my lord! give her the living child, [Kg1
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#026.md). "Let me see it hers, rather than
not see it at all." By this tenderness towards the child it appeared
that she was not the careless mother that had overlaid the dead child,
but was the true mother of the living one, that could not endure to see
its death, having compassion on the son of her womb. "The case is
plain," says Solomon; "what need of witnesses? Give her the living
child; for you all see, by this undissembled compassion, she is the
mother of it." Let parents show their love to their children by taking
care of them, especially by taking care of their souls, and, with a holy
violence, snatching them as brands out of the burning. Those are most
likely to have the comfort of children that do their duty to them. Satan
pretends to the heart of man, but by this it appears that he is only a
pretender, that he would be content to divide with God, whereas the
rightful sovereign of the heart will have all or none.

IV\. We are told what a great reputation Solomon got among his people by
this and other instances of his wisdom, which would have a great
influence upon the ease of his government: They feared the king ([Kg1
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#028).md), highly reverenced him, durst
not in any thing oppose him, and were afraid of doing an unjust thing;
for they knew, if ever it came before him, he would certainly discover
it, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, that is, that wisdom
with which God had promised to endue him. This made his face to shine,
[Ecc 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001.md). This strengthened him, [Ecc
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#019.md). This was better to him than
weapons of war, [Ecc 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#018.md). For this he
was both feared and loved.
