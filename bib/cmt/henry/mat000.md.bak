An Exposition, with Practical Observations, of The Gospel According to
St. Matthew

We have now before us, I. The New Testament of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ; so this second part of the holy Bible is entitled: The new
covenant; so it might as well be rendered; the word signifies both. But,
when it is (as here) spoken of as Christ's act and deed, it is most
properly rendered a testament, for he is the testator, and it becomes of
force by his death ([Heb 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016.md), [Heb
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#017).md); nor is there, as in covenants,
a previous treaty between the parties, but what is granted, though an
estate upon condition, is owing to the will, the free-will, the
good-will, of the Testator. All the grace contained in this book is
owing to Jesus Christ as our Lord and Saviour; and, unless we consent to
him as our Lord, we cannot expect any benefit by him as our Saviour.
This is called a new testament, to distinguish it from that which was
given by Moses, and was not antiquated; and to signify that it should be
always new, and should never wax old, and grow out of date. These books
contain, not only a full discovery of that grace which has appeared to
all men, bringing salvation, but a legal instrument by which it is
conveyed to, and settled upon, all believers. How carefully do we
preserve, and with what attention and pleasure do we read, the last will
and testament of a friend, who has therein left us a fair estate, and,
with it, high expressions of his love to us! How precious then should
this testament of our blessed Saviour be to us, which secures to us all
his unsearchable riches! It is his testament; for though, as is usual,
it was written by others (we have nothing upon record that was of
Christ's own writing), yet he dictated it; and the night before he died,
in the institution of his supper, he signed, sealed, and published it,
in the presence of twelve witnesses. For, though these books were not
written for some years after, for the benefit of posterity, in perpetuam
rei memoriam - as a perpetual memorial, yet the New Testament of our
Lord Jesus was settled, confirmed, and declared, from the time of his
death, as a nuncupative will, with which these records exactly agree.
The things which St. Luke wrote were things which were most surely
believed, and therefore well known, before he wrote them; but, when they
were written, the oral tradition was superseded and set aside, and these
writings were the repository of that New Testament. This is intimated by
the title which is prefixed to many Greek Copies, Tē kainēs Diathēkēs
Hapanta - The whole of the New Testament, or all the things of it. In it
is declared the whole counsel of God concerning our salvation, [Act
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#027.md). As the law of the Lord is
perfect, so is the gospel of Christ, and nothing is to be added to it.
We have it all, and are to look for no more.

II\. We have before us The Four Gospels. Gospel signifies good news, or
glad tidings; and this history of Christ's coming into the world to save
sinners is, without doubt, the best news that ever came from heaven to
earth; the angel gave it this title ([Luk
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#010).md), Euagnelizomai humin - I bring
you good tidings; I bring the gospel to you. And the prophet foretold
it, [Isa 52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007.md); [Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md). It is there foretold that in the
days of the messiah good tidings should be preached. Gospel is an old
Saxon word; it is God's spell or word; and God is so called because he
is good, Deus optimus - God most excellent, and therefore it may be a
good spell, or word. If we take spell in its more proper signification
for a charm (carmen), and take that in a good sense, for what is moving
and affecting, which is apt lenire dolorem - to calm the spirits, or to
raise them in admiration or love, as that which is very amiable we call
charming, it is applicable to the gospel; for in it the charmer charmeth
wisely, though to deaf adders, [Psa
58:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#004.md), [Psa
58:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#005). Nor (one would think.md) can any
charms be so powerful as those of the beauty and love of our Redeemer.
The whole New Testament is the gospel. St. Paul calls it his gospel,
because he was one of the preachers of it. Oh that we may each of us
make it ours by our cordial acceptance of it and subjection to it! But
the four books which contain the history of the Redeemer we commonly
call the four gospels, and the inspired penmen of them evangelists, or
gospel-writers; not, however, very properly, because that title belongs
to a particular order of ministers, that were assistants to the apostles
([Eph 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011).md): He gave some apostles,
and some evangelists. It was requisite that the doctrine of Christ
should be interwoven with, and founded upon, the narrative of his birth,
life, miracles, death, and resurrection; for then it appears in its
clearest and strongest light. As in nature, so in grace, the most happy
discoveries are those which take rise from the certain representations
of matters of fact. Natural history is the best philosophy; and so is
the sacred history, both of the Old and New Testament, the most proper
and grateful vehicle of sacred truth. These four gospels were early and
constantly received by the primitive church, and read in Christian
assemblies, as appears by the writings of Justin Martyr and Irenaeus,
who lived little more than a hundred years after the ascension of
Christ; they declared that neither more nor fewer than four were
received by the church. A Harmony of these four evangelists was compiled
by Tatian about that time, which he called, To dia tessarōn - The Gospel
out of the four. In the third and fourth centuries there were gospels
forged by divers sects, and published, one under the name of St. Peter,
another of St. Thomas, another of St. Philip, etc. But they were never
owned by the church, nor was any credit given to them, as the learned
Dr. Whitby shows. And he gives this good reason why we should adhere to
these written records, because, whatever the pretences of tradition may
be, it is not sufficient to preserve things with any certainty, as
appears by experience. For, whereas Christ said and did many memorable
things, which were not written ([Joh
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#030.md); [Joh
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#025).md), tradition has not preserved
any one of them to us, but all is lost except what was written; that
therefore is what we must abide by; and blessed by God that we have it
to abide by; it is the sure word of history.

III\. We have before us the Gospel according to St. Matthew. The penman
was by birth a Jew, by calling a publican, till Christ commanded his
attendance, and then he left the receipt of custom, to follow him, and
was one of those that accompanied him all the time that the Lord Jesus
went in and out, beginning from the baptism of John unto the day that he
was taken up, [Act 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#021.md), [Act
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022.md). He was therefore a competent
witness of what he has here recorded. He is said to have written this
history about eight years after Christ's ascension. Many of the ancients
say that he wrote it in the Hebrew or Syriac language; but the tradition
is sufficiently disproved by Dr. Whitby. Doubtless, it was written in
Greek, as the other parts of the New Testament were; not in that
language which was peculiar to the Jews, whose church and state were
near a period, but in that which was common to the world, and in which
the knowledge of Christ would be most effectually transmitted to the
nations of the earth; yet it is probable that there might be an edition
of it in Hebrew, published by St. Matthew himself, at the same time that
he wrote it in Greek; the former for the Jews, the latter for the
Gentiles, when he left Judea, to preach among the Gentiles. Let us bless
God that we have it, and have it in a language we understand.
