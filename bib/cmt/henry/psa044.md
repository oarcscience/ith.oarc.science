### [Psalms Chapter 44](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 44:0</span></span>

We are not told either who was the penmen of this psalm or when and upon
what occasion it was penned, upon a melancholy occasion, we are sure,
not so much to the penman himself (then we could have found occasions
enough for it in the history of David and his afflictions), but to the
church of God in general; and therefore, if we suppose it penned by
David, yet we must attribute it purely to the Spirit of prophecy, and
must conclude that the Spirit (whatever he himself had) had in view the
captivity of Babylon, or the sufferings of the Jewish church under
Antiochus, or rather the afflicted state of the Christian church in its
early days (to which [Psa 44:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022.md) is
applied by the apostle, [Rom 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#036).md),
and indeed in all its days on earth, for it is its determined lot that
it must enter into the kingdom of heaven through many tribulations. And,
if we have any gospel-psalms pointing at the privileges and comforts of
Christians, why should we not have one pointing at their trials and
exercises? It is a psalm calculated for a day of fasting and humiliation
upon occasion of some public calamity, either pressing or threatening.
In it the church is taught, I. To own with thankfulness, to the glory of
God, the great things God has done for their fathers ([Psa
44:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001).md). II. To exhibit a memorial of
their present calamitous estate ([Psa
44:9-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#009).md). III. To file a protestation
of their integrity and adherence to God notwithstanding ([Psa
44:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#017).md). IV. To lodge a petition at
the throne of grace for succour and relief ([Psa
44:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022).md). In singing this psalm we
ought to give God the praise of what he has formerly done for his
people, to represent our own grievances, or sympathize with those parts
of the church that are in distress, to engage ourselves, whatever
happens, to cleave to God and duty, and then cheerfully to wait the
event.

To the chief musician for the sons of Korah, Maschil.

[Psalms 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 44:1</span></span>

Some observe that most of the psalms that are entitled Maschil - psalms
of instruction, are sorrowful psalms; for afflictions give instructions,
and sorrow of spirit opens the ear to them. Blessed is the man whom thou
chastenest and teachest.

In these verses the church, though now trampled upon, calls to
remembrance the days of her triumph, of her triumph in God and over her
enemies. This is very largely mentioned here, 1. As an aggravation of
the present distress. The yoke of servitude cannot but lie very heavily
on the necks of those that used to wear the crown of victory; and the
tokens of God's displeasure must needs be most grievous to those that
have been long accustomed to the tokens of his favour. 2. As an
encouragement to hope that God would yet turn again their captivity and
return in mercy to them; accordingly he mixes prayers and comfortable
expectations with his record of former mercies. Observe,

I. Their commemoration of the great things God had formerly done for
them.

1\. In general ([Psa 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001).md): Our
fathers have told us what work thou didst in their days. Observe, (1.)
The many operations of providence are here spoken of as one work - "They
have told us the work which thou didst;" for there is a wonderful
harmony and uniformity in all that God does, and the many wheels make
but one wheel ([Eze 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#013).md), many works
make but one work. (2.) It is a debt which every age owes to posterity
to keep an account of God's works of wonder, and to transmit the
knowledge of them to the next generation. Those that went before us told
us what God did in their days, we are bound to tell those that come
after us what he has done in our days, and let them do the like justice
to those that shall succeed them; thus shall one generation praise his
works to another ([Psa 145:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#004).md), the
fathers to the children shall make known his truth, [Isa
38:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#019). (3..md) We must not only make
mention of the work God has done in our own days, but must also acquaint
ourselves and our children with what he did in the times of old, long
before our own days; and of this we have in the scripture a sure word of
history, as sure as the word of prophecy. (4.) Children must diligently
attend to what their parents tell them of the wonderful works of God,
and keep it in remembrance, as that which will be of great use to them.
(5.) Former experiences of God's power and goodness are strong supports
to faith and powerful pleas in prayer under present calamities. See how
Gideon insists upon it ([Jdg 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#013).md):
Where are all his miracles which our fathers told us of?

2\. In particular, their fathers had told them,

(1.) How wonderfully God planted Israel in Canaan at first, [Psa
44:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#002.md), [Psa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003.md). He drove out the natives, to
make room for Israel, afflicted them, and cast them out, gave them as
dust to Israel's sword and as driven stubble to their bow. The many
complete victories which Israel obtained over the Canaanites, under the
command of Joshua, were not to be attributed to themselves, nor could
they challenge the glory of them. \[1.\] They were not owing to their
own merit, but to God's favour and free grace: It was through the light
of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour to them. Not for thy
righteousness, or the uprightness of thy heart, doth God drive them out
from before thee ([Deu 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#005.md), [Deu
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#006).md), but because God would perform
the oath which he swore unto their fathers, [Deu
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#008.md). The less praise this allows us
the more comfort it administers to us, that we may see all our successes
and enlargements coming to us from the favour of God and the light of
his countenance. \[2.\] They were not owing to their own might, but to
God's power engaged for them, without which all their own efforts and
endeavours would have been fruitless. It was not by their own sword that
they got the land in possession, though they had great numbers of mighty
men; nor did their own arm save them from being driven back by the
Canaanites and put to shame; but it was God's right hand and his arm. He
fought for Israel, else they would have fought in vain; it was through
him that they did valiantly and victoriously. It was God that planted
Israel in that good land, as the careful husbandman plants a tree, from
which he promises himself fruit. See [Psa
80:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008.md). This is applicable to the
planting of the Christian church in the world, by the preaching of the
gospel. Paganism was wonderfully driven out, as the Canaanites, not all
at once, but by little and little, not by any human policy or power (for
God chose to do it by the weak and foolish things of the world), but by
the wisdom and power of God - Christ by his Spirit went forth conquering
and to conquer; and the remembrance of that is a great support and
comfort to those that groan under the yoke of antichristian tyranny, for
to the state of the church under the power of the New Testament Babylon,
some think (and particularly the learned Amyraldus), the complaints in
the latter part of this psalm may very fitly be accommodated. He that by
his power and goodness planted a church for himself in the world will
certainly support it by the same power and goodness; and the gates of
hell shall not prevail against it.

(2.) How frequently he had given them success against their enemies that
attempted to disturb them in the possession of that good land ([Psa
44:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#007).md): Thou hast, many a time, saved
us from our enemies, and hast put to flight, and so put to shame, those
that hated us, witness the successes of the judges against the nations
that oppressed Israel. Many a time have the persecutors of the Christian
church, and those that hate it, been put to shame by the power of truth,
[Act 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#010.md).

II\. The good use they make of this record, and had formerly made of it,
in consideration of the great things God had done for their fathers of
old.

1\. They had taken God for their sovereign Lord, had sworn allegiance to
him, and put themselves under his protection ([Psa
44:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#004).md): Thou art my King, O God! He
speaks in the name of the church, as ([Psa
74:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#012).md), Thou art my King of old. God,
as a king, has made laws for his church, provided for the peace and good
order of it, judged for it, pleaded its cause, fought its battles, and
protected it; it is his kingdom in the world, and ought to be subject to
him, and to pay him tribute. Or the psalmist speaks for himself here:
"Lord, Thou art my King; whither shall I go with my petitions, but to
thee? The favour I ask is not for myself, but for thy church." Note, It
is every one's duty to improve his personal interest at the throne of
grace for the public welfare and prosperity of the people of God; as
Moses, "If I have found grace in thy sight, guide thy people," [Exo
33:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#013.md).

2\. They had always applied to him by prayer for deliverance when at any
time they were in distress: Command deliverances for Jacob. Observe,
(1.) The enlargedness of their desire. They pray for deliverances, not
one, but many, as many as they had need of, how many soever they were, a
series of deliverances, a deliverance from every danger. (2.) The
strength of their faith in the power of God. They do not say, Work
deliverances, but Command them, which denotes his doing it easily and
instantly - Speak and it is done (such was the faith of the centurion,
[Mat 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#008.md), Speak the word only, and my
servant shall be healed); it denotes also his doing it effectually:
"Command it, as one having authority, whose command will be obeyed."
Where the word of a king is there is power, much more the word of the
King of kings.

3\. They had trusted and triumphed in him. As they owned it was not
their own sword and bow that had saved them ([Psa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003).md), so neither did they trust to
their own sword or bow to save them for the future ([Psa
44:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#006).md): "I will not trust in my bow,
nor in any of my military preparations, as if those would stand me in
stead without God. No; through thee will we push down our enemies ([Psa
44:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#005).md); we will attempt it in thy
strength, relying only upon that, and not upon the number or valour of
our forces; and, having thee on our side, we will not doubt of success
in the attempt. Through thy name (by virtue of thy wisdom directing us,
thy power strengthening us and working for us, and thy promise securing
success to us) we shall, we will, tread those under that rise up against
us."

4\. They had made him their joy and praise ([Psa
44:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#008).md): "In God we have boasted; in him
we do and will boast, every day, and all the day long." When their
enemies boasted of their strength and successes, as Sennacherib and
Rabshakeh hectored Hezekiah, they owned they had nothing to boast of, in
answer thereunto, but their relation to God and their interest in him;
and, if he were for them, they could set all the world at defiance. Let
him that glories glory in the Lord, and let that for ever exclude all
other boasting. Let those that trust in God make their boast in him, for
they know whom they have trusted; let them boast in him all the day
long, for it is a subject that can never be exhausted. But let them
withal praise his name for ever; if they have the comfort of his name,
let them give unto him the glory due to it.

[Psalms 44:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 44:9</span></span>

The people of God here complain to him of the low and afflicted
condition that they were now in, under the prevailing power of their
enemies and oppressors, which was the more grievous to them because they
were now trampled upon, who had always been used, in their struggles
with their neighbours, to win the day and get the upper hand, and
because those were now their oppressors whom they had many a time
triumphed over and made tributaries, and especially because they had
boasted in their God with great assurance that he would still protect
and prosper them, which made the distress they were in, and the disgrace
they were under, the more shameful. Let us see what the complaint is.

I. That they wanted the usual tokens of God's favour to them and
presence with them ([Psa 44:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#009).md): "Thou
hast cast off; thou seemest to have cast us off and our cause, and to
have cast off thy wonted care of us and concern for us, and so hast put
us to shame, for we boasted of the constancy and perpetuity of thy
favour. Our armies go forth as usual, but they are put to flight; we
gain no ground, but lose what we have gained, for thou goest not forth
with them, for, if thou didst, which way soever they turned they would
prosper; but it is quite contrary." Note, God's people, when they are
cast down, are tempted to think themselves cast off and forsaken of God;
but it is a mistake. Hath God cast away his people? God forbid, [Rom
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001.md).

II\. That they were put to the worst before their enemies in the field
of battle ([Psa 44:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#010).md): Thou makest us
to turn back from the enemy, as Joshua complained when they met with a
repulse at Ai ([Jos 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#008).md): "We are
dispirited, and have lost the ancient valour of Israelites; we flee, we
fall, before those that used to flee and fall before us; and then those
that hate us have the plunder of our camp and of our country; they spoil
for themselves, and reckon all their own that they can lay their hands
on. Attempts to shake off the Babylonish yoke have been ineffectual, and
we have rather lost ground by them."

III\. That they were doomed to the sword and to captivity ([Psa
44:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#011).md): "Thou hast given us like sheep
appointed for meat. They make no more scruple of killing an Israelite
than of killing a sheep; nay, like the butcher, they make a trade of it,
they take a pleasure in it as a hungry man in his meat; and we are led
with as much ease, and as little resistance, as a lamb to the slaughter;
many are slain, and the rest scattered among the heathen, continually
insulted by their malice or in danger of being infected by their
iniquities." They looked upon themselves as bought and sold, and charged
it upon God, Thou sellest thy people, when they should have charged it
upon their own sin. For your iniquities have you sold yourselves, [Isa
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001.md). However, thus far was right that
they looked above the instruments of their trouble and kept their eye
upon God, as well knowing that their worst enemies had no power against
them but what was given them from above; they own it was God that
delivered them into the hand of the ungodly, as that which is sold is
delivered to the buyer. Thou sellest them for nought, and dost not
increase in their price (so it may be read); "thou dost not sell them by
auction, to those that will bid most for them, but in haste, to those
that will bid first for them; any one shall have them that will." Or, as
we read it, Thou dost not increase thy wealth by their price, intimating
that they could have suffered this contentedly if they had been sure
that it would redound to the glory of God and that his interest might be
some way served by their sufferings; but it was quite contrary: Israel's
disgrace turned to God's dishonour, so that he was so far from being a
gainer in his glory by the sale of them that it should seem he was
greatly a loser by it; see [Isa 52:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#005.md);
[Eze 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#020.md).

IV\. That they were loaded with contempt, and all possible ignominy was
put upon them. In this also they acknowledge God: "Thou makest us a
reproach; thou bringest those calamities upon us which occasion the
reproach, and thou permittest their virulent tongues to smite us." They
complain, 1. That they were ridiculed and bantered, and were looked upon
as the most contemptible people under the sun; their troubles were
turned to their reproach, and upon the account of them they were
derided. 2. That their neighbours, those about them, from whom they
could not withdraw, were most abusive to them, [Psa
44:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#013.md). 3. That the heathen, the people
that were strangers to the commonwealth of Israel and aliens to the
covenants of promise, made them a by-word, and shook the head at them,
as triumphing in their fall, [Psa
44:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#014.md). 4. That the reproach was
constant and incessant ([Psa 44:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#015).md):
My confusion is continually before me. The church in general, the
psalmist in particular, were continually teased and vexed with the
insults of the enemy. Concerning those that are going down every one
cries, "Down with them." 5. That it was very grievous, and in a manner
overwhelmed him: The shame of my face has covered me. He blushed for
sin, or rather for the dishonour done to God, and then it was a holy
blushing. 6. That it reflected upon God himself; the reproach which the
enemy and the avenger cast upon them was downright blasphemy against
God, [Psa 44:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#016.md), and [Kg2
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#003.md). There was therefore strong
reason to believe that God would appear for them. As there is no trouble
more grievous to a generous and ingenuous mind than reproach and
calumny, so there is none more grievous to a holy gracious soul than
blasphemy and dishonour done to God.

[Psalms 44:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 44:17</span></span>

The people of God, being greatly afflicted and oppressed, here apply to
him; whither else should they go?

I. By way of appeal, concerning their integrity, which he only is an
infallible judge of, and which he will certainly be the rewarder of. Two
things they call God to witness to: -

1\. That, though they suffered these hard things, yet they kept close to
God and to their duty ([Psa 44:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#017).md):
"All this has come upon us, and it is as bad perhaps as bad can be, yet
have we not forgotten thee, neither cast off the thoughts of thee nor
deserted the worship of thee; for, though we cannot deny but that we
have dealt foolishly, yet we have not dealt falsely in thy covenant, so
as to cast thee off and take to other gods. Though idolaters were our
conquerors, we did not therefore entertain any more favourable thoughts
of their idols and idolatries; though thou hast seemed to forsake us and
withdraw from us, yet we have not therefore forsaken thee." The trouble
they had been long in was very great: "We have been sorely broken in the
place of dragons, among men as fierce, and furious, and cruel, as
dragons. We have been covered with the shadow of death, that is, we have
been under deep melancholy and apprehensive of nothing short of death.
We have been wrapped up in obscurity, and buried alive; and thou hast
thus broken us, thou hast thus covered us ([Psa
44:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#019).md), yet we have not harboured any
hard thoughts of thee, nor meditated a retreat from thy service. Though
thou hast slain us, we have continued to trust in thee: Our heart has
not turned back; we have not secretly withdrawn our affections from
thee, neither have our steps, either in our religious worship or in our
conversation, declined from they way ([Psa
44:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#018).md), the way which thou hast
appointed us to walk in." When the heart turns back the steps will soon
decline; for it is the evil heart of unbelief that inclines to depart
from God. Note, We may the better bear our troubles, how pressing
soever, if in them we still hold fast our integrity. While our troubles
do not drive us from our duty to God we should not suffer them to drive
us from our comfort in God; for he will not leave us if we do not leave
him. For the proof of their integrity they take God's omniscience to
witness, which is as much the comfort of the upright in heart as it is
the terror of hypocrites ([Psa 44:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#020.md),
[Psa 44:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#021).md): "If we have forgotten the
name of our God, under pretence that he had forgotten us, or in our
distress have stretched out our hands to a strange god, as more likely
to help us, shall not God search this out? Shall he not know it more
fully and distinctly than we know that which we have with the greatest
care and diligence searched out? Shall he not judge it, and call us to
an account for it?" Forgetting God was a heart-sin, and stretching our
the hand to a strange god was often a secret sin, [Eze
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#012.md). But heart-sins and secret sins
are known to God, and must be reckoned for; for he knows the secrets of
the heart, and therefore is a infallible judge of the words and actions.

2\. That they suffered these hard things because they kept close to God
and to their duty ([Psa 44:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022).md): "It is
for thy sake that we are killed all the day long, because we stand
related to thee, are called by thy name, call upon thy name, and will
not worship other gods." In this the Spirit of prophecy had reference to
those who suffered even unto death for the testimony of Christ, to whom
it is applied, [Rom 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#036.md). So many were
killed, and put to such lingering deaths, that they were in the killing
all the day long; so universally was this practised that when a man
became a Christian he reckoned himself as a sheep appointed for the
slaughter.

II\. By way of petition, with reference to their present distress, that
God would, in his own due time, work deliverance for them. 1. Their
request is very importunate: Awake, arise, [Psa
44:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#023.md). Arise for our help; redeem us
([Psa 44:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#026).md); come speedily and
powerfully to our relief, [Psa 80:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#002.md).
Stir up thy strength, and come and save us. They had complained ([Psa
44:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#012).md) that God had sold them; here
they pray ([Psa 44:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#026).md) that God would
redeem them; for there is no appealing from God, but by appealing to
him. If he sell us, it is not any one else that can redeem us; the same
hand that tears must heal, that smites must bind up, [Hos
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001.md). They had complained ([Psa
44:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#009).md), Thou hast cast us off; but here
they pray ([Psa 44:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#023).md), "Cast us not
off forever; let us not be finally forsaken of God." 2. The
expostulations are very moving: Why sleepest thou? [Psa
44:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#023.md). He that keeps Israel neither
slumbers nor sleeps; but, when he does not immediately appear for the
deliverance of his people, they are tempted to think he sleeps. The
expression is figurative (as [Psa
78:65](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#065.md), Then the Lord awaked as one out
of sleep); but it was applicable to Christ in the letter ([Mat
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#024).md); he was asleep when his
disciples were in a storm, and they awoke him, saying, Lord, save us, we
perish. "Wherefore hidest thou thy face, that we may not see thee and
the light of thy countenance?" Or, "that thou mayest not see us and our
distresses? Thou forgettest our affliction and our oppression, for it
still continues, and we see no way open for our deliverance." And, 3.
The pleas are very proper, not their own merit and righteousness, though
they had the testimony of their consciences concerning their integrity,
but they plead the poor sinner's pleas. (1.) Their own misery, which
made them the proper objects of the divine compassion ([Psa
44:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#025).md): "Our soul is bowed down to the
dust under prevailing grief and fear. We have become as creeping things,
the most despicable animals: Our belly cleaves unto the earth; we cannot
lift up ourselves, neither revive our own drooping spirits nor recover
ourselves out of our low and sad condition, and we lie exposed to be
trodden on by every insulting foe." 2. God's mercy: "O redeem us for
they mercies' sake; we depend upon the goodness of thy nature, which is
the glory of thy name ([Exo 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006).md), and
upon those sure mercies of David which are conveyed by the covenant to
all his spiritual seed."
