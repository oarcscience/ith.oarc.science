### [Isaiah Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 33:0</span></span>

This chapter relates to the same events as the foregoing chapter, the
distress of Judah and Jerusalem by Sennacherib's invasion and their
deliverance out of that distress by the destruction of the Assyrian
army. These are intermixed in the prophecy, in the way of a Pindaric.
Observe, I. The great distress that Judah and Jerusalem should then be
brought into ([Isa 33:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#007).md). II. The
particular frights which the sinners in Zion should then be in ([Isa
33:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#013.md), [Isa
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014).md). III. The prayers of good
people to God in this distress ([Isa
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#002).md). IV. The holy security which
they should enjoy in the midst of this trouble ([Isa
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#015.md), [Isa
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#016).md). V. The destruction of the army
of the Assyrians ([Isa 33:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001).md), in
which God would be greatly glorified ([Isa
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#005.md), [Isa
33:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#010).md). VI. The enriching of the
Jews with the spoil of the Assyrian camp ([Isa
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#004.md), [Isa
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#023.md), [Isa
33:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#024).md). VII. The happy settlement of
Jerusalem, and the Jewish state, upon this. Religion shall be uppermost
([Isa 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#006).md), and their civil state
shall flourish ([Isa 33:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#017).md). This
was soon fulfilled, but is written for our learning.

[Isaiah 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 33:1</span></span>

Here we have,

I. The proud and false Assyrian justly reckoned with for all his fraud
and violence, and laid under a woe, [Isa
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001.md). Observe, 1. The sin which the
enemy had been guilty of. He had spoiled the people of God, and made a
prey of them, and herein had broken his treaty of peace with them, and
dealt treacherously. Truth and mercy are two such sacred things, and
have so much of God in them, that those cannot but be under the wrath of
God that make conscience of neither, but are perfectly lost to both,
that care not what mischief they do, what spoil they make, what
dissimulations they are guilty of, nor what solemn engagements they
violate, to compass their own wicked designs. Bloody and deceitful men
are the worst of men. 2. The aggravation of this sin. He spoiled those
that had never done him any injury and that he had no pretence to
quarrel with, and dealt treacherously with those that had always dealt
faithfully with him. Note, The less provocation we have from men to do a
wrong thing the more provocation we give to God by doing it. 3. The
punishment he should fall under for this sin. He that spoiled the cities
of Judah shall have his own army destroyed by an angel and his camp
plundered by those whom he had made a prey of. The Chaldeans shall deal
treacherously with the Assyrians and revolt from them. Two of
Sennacherib's own sons shall deal treacherously with him and basely
murder him at his devotions. Note, The righteous God often pays sinners
in their own coin. He that leads into captivity shall go into captivity,
[Rev 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#010.md); [Rev
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#006.md). 4. The time when he shall be
thus dealt with. When he shall make an end to spoil, and to deal
treacherously, not by repentance and reformation, which might prevent
his ruin ([Dan 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#027).md), but when he
shall have done his worst, when he shall have gone as far as God would
permit him to go, to the utmost of his tether, then the cup of trembling
shall be put into his hand. When he shall have arrived at his full
stature in impiety, shall have filled up the measure of his iniquity,
then all shall be called over again. When he has done God will begin,
for his day is coming.

II\. The praying people of God earnest at the throne of grace for mercy
for the land now in its distress ([Isa
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#002).md): "O Lord! be merciful to us. Men
are cruel; be thou gracious. We have deserved thy wrath, but we entreat
thy favour; and, if we may find the propitious to us, we are happy; the
trouble we are in cannot hurt us, shall not ruin us. It is in vain to
expect relief from creatures; we have no confidence in the Egyptians,
but we have waited for thee only, resolving to submit to thee, whatever
the issue of the trouble be, and hoping that it shall be a comfortable
issue." Those that by faith humbly wait for God shall certainly find him
gracious to them. They prayed, 1. For those that were employed in
military services for them: "Be thou their arm every morning. Hezekiah,
and his princes, and all the men of war, need continual supplies of
strength and courage from thee; supply their need therefore, and be to
them a God all-sufficient. Every morning, when they go forth upon the
business of the day, and perhaps have new work to do and new
difficulties to encounter, let them be afresh animated and invigorated,
and, as the day, so let the strength be." In our spiritual warfare our
own hands are not sufficient for us, nor can we bring any thing to pass
unless God not only strengthen our arms ([Gen
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024).md), but be himself our arm; so
entirely do we depend upon him as our arm every morning, so constantly
do we depend upon his power, as well as his compassions, which are new
every morning, [Lam 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#023.md). If God
leaves us to ourselves any morning, we are undone; we must therefore
every morning commit ourselves to him, and go forth in his strength to
do the work of the day in its day. 2. For the body of the people: "Be
thou our salvation also in the time of trouble, ours who sit still, and
do not venture into the high places of the field." They depend upon God
not only as their Saviour, to work deliverance for them, but as their
salvation itself; for, whatever becomes of their secular interests, they
will reckon themselves safe and saved if they have him for their God. If
he undertake to be their Saviour, he will be their salvation; for as for
God his work is perfect. Some read it thus: "Thou who wast their arm
every morning, who wast the continual strength and help of our fathers
before us, be thou our salvation also in time of trouble. Help us as
thou helpedst them; they looked unto thee and were lightened ([Psa
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#005).md); let us then not walk in
darkness."

III\. The Assyrian army ruined and their camp made a rich but cheap and
easy prey to Judah and Jerusalem. No sooner is the prayer made ([Isa
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#002).md) than it is answered ([Isa
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#003).md), nay, it is outdone. They prayed
that God would save them from their enemies; but he did more than that;
he gave them victory over their enemies and abundant cause to triumph;
for, 1. The strength of the Assyrian camp was broken ([Isa
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#003).md) when the destroying angel slew
so many thousands of them: At the noise of the tumult, of the shrieks of
the dying men (who, we may suppose, did not die silently), the rest of
the people fled, and shifted every one for his own safety. When God did
thus lift up himself the several nations, or clans, of which the army
was composed, were scattered. It was time to stir when such an
unprecedented plague broke out among them. When God arises his enemies
are scattered, [Psa 68:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#001.md). 2. The spoil
of the Assyrian camp is seized, by way of reprisal, for all the
desolations of the defenced cities of Judah ([Isa
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#004).md): Your spoil shall be gathered by
the inhabitants of Jerusalem, like the gathering of the caterpillar, and
as the running to and fro of locusts, that is, the spoilers shall as
easily and as quickly make themselves masters of the riches of the
Assyrians as a host of caterpillars, or locusts, make a field, or a
tree, bare. Thus the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just and
Israel is enriched with the spoil of the Egyptians. Some make the
Assyrians to be the caterpillars and locusts, which, when they are
killed, are gathered together in heaps, as the frogs of Egypt, and are
run upon, and trodden to dirt.

IV\. God and his Israel glorified and exalted hereby. When the spoil of
the enemy is thus gathered, 1. God will have the praise of it ([Isa
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#005).md): The Lord is exalted. It is his
honour thus to abase proud men, and hide them in the dust, together;
thus he magnifies his own name, and his people give him the glory of it,
as Israel when the Egyptians were drowned, [Exo
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#001.md), [Exo
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#002.md), etc. He is exalted as one that
dwells on high, out of the reach of their blasphemies, and that has an
over-ruling power over them, and wherein they deal proudly delights to
show himself above them - that does what he will, and they cannot resist
him. 2. His people will have the blessing of it. When God lifts up
himself to scatter the nations that are in confederacy against Jerusalem
([Isa 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#003).md) then, as a preparative for
that, or as the fruit and product of it, he has filled Zion with
judgment and righteousness, not only with a sense of justice, but with a
zeal for it and a universal care that it be duly administered. It shall
again be called, The city of righteousness, [Isa
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#026.md). In this the grace of God is
exalted, as much as his providence was in the destruction of the
Assyrian army. We may conclude God has mercy in store for a people when
he fills them with judgment and righteousness, when all sorts of people,
and all their actions and affairs, are governed by them, and they are so
full of them that no other considerations can crowd in to sway them
against these. Hezekiah and his people are encouraged ([Isa
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#006).md) with an assurance that God would
stand by them in their distress. Here is, (1.) A gracious promise of God
for them to stay themselves upon: Wisdom and knowledge shall be the
stability of thy times, and strength of salvation. Here is a desirable
end proposed, and that is the stability of our times, that things be not
disturbed and unhinged at home, and the strength of salvation,
deliverance from, and success against, enemies abroad. The salvation
that God ordains for his people has strength in it; it is a horn of
salvation. And here are the way and means for obtaining this end -
wisdom and knowledge, not only piety, but prudence. That is it which, by
the blessing of God, will be the stability of our times and the strength
of salvation, that wisdom which is first pure, then peaceable, and which
sacrifices private interests to a public good; such prudence as this
will establish truth and peace, and fortify the bulwarks in defence of
them. (2.) A pious maxim of state for Hezekiah and his people to govern
themselves by: The fear of the Lord is his treasure. It is God's
treasure in the world, from which he receives his tribute; or, rather,
it is the prince's treasure. A good prince accounts it so (that wisdom
is better than gold) and he shall find it so. Note, True religion is the
true treasure of any prince or people; it denominates them rich. Those
places that have plenty of Bibles, and ministers, and serious good
people, are really rich; and it contributes to that which makes a nation
rich in this world. It is therefore the interest of a people to support
religion among them and to take heed of every thing that threatens to
hinder it.

V. The great distress that Jerusalem was brought into described, that
those who believed the prophet might know beforehand what troubles were
coming and might provide accordingly, and that when the foregoing
promise of their deliverance should have its accomplishment the
remembrance of the extremity of their case might help to magnify God in
it and make them the more thankful, [Isa
33:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#007.md). It is here foretold, 1. That
the enemy would be very insolent and abusive and there would be no
dealing with him, either by treaties of peace (for he has broken the
covenant without any hesitation, as if it were below him to be a servant
to his word), or by the preparations of war, for he has despised the
cities; he scorns to take notice either of their appeals to justice or
of their petitions for mercy. He makes himself master of them so easily
(though they are called fenced cities), and meets with so little
resistance, that he despises them, and has no relentings when he puts
all to the sword; for he regards no man, has no pity or concern, no, not
for those that he is under particular obligations to. He neither fears
God nor regards man, but is haughty and imperious to every one. There
are those that take a pride in trampling upon all mankind, and have
neither veneration for the honourable nor compassion for the miserable.
2. That therefore he would not be brought to any terms of
reconciliation: The valiant ones of Jerusalem, being unable to make
their parts good with him, must be contentedly run down with noise and
insolence, which will make them cry without, because they cannot serve
their country as they might have done against a fair adversary. The
ambassadors sent by Hezekiah to treat of peace, finding him so haughty
and unmanageable, shall weep bitterly for vexation at the disappointment
they had met with in their negotiations; they shall weep like children,
as despairing to find out any expedient to pacify him. 3. That the
country should be made quite desolate for a time by his army. (1.) No
man durst travel the roads; so that a stop was put to trade and
commerce, and (which was worse) no man could safely go up to Jerusalem,
to keep the solemn feasts: The highways lie waste. While the fields lie
waste, trodden like the highways, the highways lie waste, untrodden like
the fields, for the traveller ceases. (2.) No man had any profit from
the grounds, [Isa 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#009.md). The earth used
to rejoice in its own productions for the service of God's Israel, but
now the enemies of Israel eat them up, or tread them down: it mourns and
languishes; the country looks melancholy and the country people have
misery in their countenances, wanting necessary food for themselves and
their families; the wonted joy of harvest is turned into lamentation, so
withering and uncertain are all worldly joys. The desolation is
universal. That part of the country which belonged to the ten tribes was
already laid waste: "Lebanon famed for cedars, Sharon for roses, Bashan
for cattle, Carmel for corn, all very fruitful, have now become like
wildernesses, are ashamed to be called by their old names, they are so
unlike what they were. They shake off their fruits before their time
into the hand of the spoiler, which used to be gathered seasonably by
the hand of the owner."

VI\. God appearing, at length, in his glory against his proud invader,
[Isa 33:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#010.md). When things are brought
thus to the last extremity, 1. God will magnify himself. He had seemed
to sit by as an unconcerned spectator: "But now will I arise, saith the
Lord; now will I appear and act, and therein I will be not only
evidenced, but exalted." He will not only demonstrate that there is a
God that judges in the earth, but that he is God over all, and higher
than the highest. "Now will I lift up myself, will prepare for action,
will act vigorously, and will be glorified in it." God's time to appear
for his people is when their affairs are reduced to the lowest ebb, when
their strength is gone and there is none shut up nor left, [Deu
32:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036.md). When all other helpers fail,
then is God's time to help. 2. He will bring down the Assyrian: "You, O
Assyrians! are big with hopes that you shall have all the wealth of
Jerusalem for your own, and are in pain till it be so; but all your
hopes shall come to nothing: You shall conceive chaff, and bring forth
stubble, which is not only worthless and good for nothing, but
combustible and proper fuel for the fire, which it cannot escape, when
your own breath as fire shall devour you, that is, the breath of God's
wrath, provoked against you by the breath of your sins - your malignant
breath, the threatenings and slaughter you breathe out against the
people of God, this shall devour you, and your blasphemous breath
against God and his name." God would make their own tongues to fall upon
them, and their own breath to blow the fire that should consume them;
and then no wonder that the people are as the burnings of lime in a
lime-kiln, all on fire together, and as thorns cut up, which are dried
and withered, and therefore easily take fire and are soon burnt up. Such
was the destruction of the Assyrian army; it was like the burning up of
thorns, which can well be spared, or the burning of lime, which makes it
good for something. The burning of that army enlightened the world with
the knowledge of God's power and made his name shine brightly.

[Isaiah 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 33:13</span></span>

Here is a preface that commands attention; and it is fit that all should
attend, both near and afar off, to what God says and does ([Isa
33:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#013).md): Hear, you that are afar off,
whether in place or time. Let distant regions and future ages hear what
God has done. They do so; they will do so from the scripture, with as
much assurance as those that were near, the neighbouring nations and
those that lived at that time. But whoever hears what God has done,
whether near or afar off, let them acknowledge his might, that it is
irresistible, and that he can do every thing. Those are very stupid who
hear what God has done and yet will not acknowledge his might. Now what
is it that God has done which we must take notice of, and in which we
must acknowledge his might?

I. He has struck a terror upon the sinners in Zion ([Isa
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014).md): Fearfulness has surprised the
hypocrites. There are sinners in Zion, hypocrites, that enjoy Zion's
privileges and concur in Zion's services, but their hearts are not right
in the sight of God; they keep up secret haunts of sin under the cloak
of a visible profession, which convicts them of hypocrisy. Sinners in
Zion will have a great deal to answer for above other sinners; and their
place in Zion will be so far from being their security that it will
aggravate both their sin and their punishment. Now those sinners in
Zion, though always subject to secret frights and terrors, were struck
with a more than ordinary consternation from the convictions of their
own consciences. 1. When they saw the Assyrian army besieging Jerusalem,
and ready to set fire to it and lay it in ashes, and burn the wasps in
the nest. Finding they could not make their escape to Egypt, as some had
done, and distrusting the promises God had made by his prophets that he
would deliver them, they were at their wits' end, and ran about like men
distracted, crying, "Who among us shall dwell with devouring fire? Let
us therefore abandon the city, and shift for ourselves elsewhere; one
had as good live in everlasting burnings as live here." Who will stand
up for us against this devouring fire? so some read it. See here how the
sinners in Zion are affected when the judgments of God are abroad; while
they were only threatened they slighted them and made nothing of them;
but, when they come to be executed, they run into the other extreme,
then they magnify them, and make the worst of them; they call them
devouring fire and everlasting burnings, and despair of relief and
succour. Those that rebel against the commands of the word cannot take
the comforts of it in a time of need. Or, rather, 2. When they saw the
Assyrian army destroyed; for the destruction of that is the fire spoken
of immediately before, [Isa 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#011.md),
[Isa 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#002.md). When the sinners in Zion
saw what dreadful execution the wrath of God made they were in a great
fright, being conscious to themselves that they had provoked this God by
their secretly worshipping other gods; and therefore they cry out, Who
among us shall dwell with this devouring fire, before which so vast an
army is as thorns? Who among us shall dwell with these everlasting
burnings, which have made the Assyrians as the burnings of lime? [Isa
33:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#012.md). Thus they said, or should have
said. Note, God's judgments upon the enemies of Zion should strike a
terror upon the sinners in Zion, nay, David himself trembles at them,
[Psa 119:120](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#120.md). God himself is this
devouring fire, [Heb 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#029.md). Who is
able to stand before him? [Sa1 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#020.md).
His wrath will burn those everlastingly that have made themselves fuel
for it. It is a fire that shall never be quenched, nor will ever go out
of itself; for it is the wrath of an everlasting God preying upon the
conscience of an immortal soul. Nor can the most daring sinners bear up
against it, so as to bear either the execution of it or the fearful
expectation of it. Let this awaken us all to flee from the wrath to
come, by fleeing to Christ as our refuge.

II\. He has graciously provided for the security of his people that
trust in him: Hear this, and acknowledge his power in making those that
walk righteously, and speak uprightly, to dwell on high, [Isa
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#015.md), [Isa
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#016.md). We have here,

1\. The good man's character, which he preserves even in times of common
iniquity, in divers instances. (1.) He walks righteously. In the whole
course of his conversation he acts by rules of equity, and makes
conscience of rendering to all their due, to God his due, as well as to
men theirs. His walk is righteousness itself; he would not for a world
wilfully do an unjust thing. (2.) He speaks uprightly, uprightnesses (so
the word is); he speaks what is true and right, and with an honest
intention. He cannot think one thing and speak another, nor look one way
and row another. His word is to him as sacred as his oath, and is not
yea and nay. (3.) He is so far from coveting ill-gotten gain that he
despises it. He thinks it a mean and sordid thing, and unbecoming a man
of honour, to enrich himself by any hardship put upon his neighbour. He
scorns to do a wrong thing, nay, to do a severe thing, though he might
get by it. He does not over-value gain itself, and therefore easily
abhors the gain that is not honestly come by. (4.) If he have a bribe at
any time thrust into his hand, to pervert justice, he shakes his hands
from holding it, with the utmost detestation, taking it as an affront to
have it offered him. (5.) He stops his ears from hearing any thing that
tends to cruelty or bloodshed, or any suggestions stirring him up to
revenge, [Job 31:31](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#031.md). He turns a deaf
ear to those that delight in war and entice him to cast in his lot among
them, [Pro 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#014.md), [Pro
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#016). (6..md) He shuts his eyes from
seeing evil. He has such an abhorrence of sin that he cannot bear to see
others commit it, and does himself watch against all the occasions of
it. Those that would preserve the purity of their souls must keep a
strict guard upon the senses of their bodies, must stop their ears to
temptations, and turn away their eyes from beholding vanity.

2\. The good man's comfort, which he may preserve even in times of
common calamity, [Isa 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#016). (1..md) He
shall be safe; he shall escape the devouring fire and the everlasting
burnings; he shall have access to, and communion with, that God who is a
devouring fire, but shall be to him a rejoicing light. And, as to
present troubles, he shall dwell on high, out of the reach of them, nay,
out of the hearing of the noise of them; he shall not be really harmed
by them, nay, he shall not be greatly frightened at them: The floods of
great waters shall not come nigh him; or, if they should attack him, his
place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks, strong and
impregnable, fortified by nature as well as art. The divine power will
keep him safe, and his faith in that power will keep him easy. God, the
rock of ages, will be his high tower. (2.) He shall be supplied; he
shall want nothing that is necessary for him: Bread shall be given him,
even when the siege is straitest and provisions are cut off; and his
waters shall be sure, that is, he shall be sure of the continuance of
them, so that he shall not drink his water by measure and with
astonishment. Those that fear the Lord shall not want any thing that is
good for them.

III\. He will protect Jerusalem, and deliver it out of the hands of the
invaders. This storm that threatened them should blow over, and they
should enjoy a prosperous state again. Many instances are here given of
this prosperity.

1\. Hezekiah shall put off his sackcloth and all the sadness of his
countenance, and shall appear publicly in his beauty, in his royal robes
and with a pleasing aspect ([Isa
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#017).md), to the great joy of all his
loving subjects. Those that walk uprightly shall not only have bread
given them, and their water sure, but they shall with an eye of faith
see the King of kings in his beauty, the beauty of holiness, and that
beauty shall be upon them.

2\. The siege being raised, by which they were kept close within the
walls of Jerusalem, they shall now be at liberty to go abroad upon
business or pleasure without danger of falling into the enemies' hand:
They shall behold the land that is very far off; they shall visit the
utmost corners of the nation, and take a prospect of the adjacent
countries, which will be the more pleasant after so long a confinement.
Thus believers behold the heavenly Canaan, that land that is very far
off, and comfort themselves with the prospect of it in evil times.

3\. The remembrance of the fright they were in shall add to the pleasure
of their deliverance ([Isa 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#018).md): Thy
heart shall meditate terror, meditate it with pleasure when it is over.
Thou shalt think thou still hearest the alarm in thy ears, when all the
cry was, "Arm, arm, arm! every man to his post. Where is the scribe or
secretary of war? Let him appear to draw up the muster-roll. Where is
the receiver and pay-master of the army? Let him see what he had in
bank, to defray the charge of a defence. Where is he that counted the
towers? Let him bring in the account of them, that care may be taken to
put a competent number of men in each." Or these words may be taken as
Jerusalem's triumph over the vanquished army of the Assyrians, and the
rather because the apostle alludes to them in his triumphs over the
learning of this world, when it was baffled by the gospel of Christ,
[Co1 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#020.md). The virgin, the daughter of
Zion, despises all their military preparations. Where is the scribe or
muster-master of the Assyrian army? Where is their weigher (or
treasurer), and where are their engineers that counted the towers? They
are all either dead or fled. There is an end of them.

4\. They shall no more be terrified with the sight of the Assyrians, who
were a fierce people naturally, and were particularly fierce against the
people of the Jews, and were of a strange language, that could
understand neither their petitions nor their complaints, and therefore
had a pretence for being deaf to them, nor could themselves be
understood: "They are of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive, which
will make them the more formidable, [Isa
33:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#019.md). Thy eyes shall no more see them
thus fierce, but their countenances changed when they shall all become
dead corpses."

5\. They shall no more be under apprehensions of the danger of
Jerusalem-Zion, and the temple there ([Isa
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#020).md): "Look upon Zion, the city of
our solemnities, the city where our solemn sacred feasts are kept, where
we used to meet to worship God in religious assemblies." The good people
among them, in the time of their distress, were most in pain for Zion
upon this account, that it was the city of their solemnities, that the
conquerors would burn their temple and they should not have that to keep
their solemn feasts in any more. In times of public danger our concern
should be most about our religion, and the cities of our solemnities
should be dearer to us than either our strong cities or our
store-cities. It is with an eye to this that God will work deliverance
for Jerusalem, because it is the city of religious solemnities: let
those be conscientiously kept up, as the glory of a people, and we may
depend upon God to create a defence upon that glory. Two things are here
promised to Jerusalem: - (1.) A well-grounded security. It shall be a
quiet habitation for the people of God; they shall not be molested and
disturbed, as they have been, by the alarms of the sword either of war
or persecution, [Isa 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#020.md). It shall
be a quiet habitation, as it is the city of our solemnities. It is
desirable to be quiet in our own houses, but much more so to be quiet in
God's house and have none to make us afraid there. Thus it shall be with
Jerusalem; and the eyes shall see it, which will be a great satisfaction
to a good man, [Psa 128:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#005.md), [Psa
128:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#006.md). "Thou shalt see the good of
Jerusalem, and peace upon Israel; thou shalt live to see it and share in
it." (2.) An unmoved stability. Jerusalem, the city of our solemnities,
is indeed but a tabernacle, in comparison with the New Jerusalem. The
present manifestations of the divine glory and grace are nothing in
comparison with those that are reserved for the future state. But it is
such a tabernacle as shall not be taken down. After this trouble is over
Jerusalem shall long enjoy a confirmed peace; and her sacred privileges,
which are the stakes and cords of her tabernacle, shall not be removed
from her, nor any disturbance given to the course and circle of her
religious services. God's church on earth is a tabernacle, which, though
it may be shifted from one place to another, shall not be taken down
while the world stands; for in every age Christ will have a seed to
serve him. The promises of the covenant are its stakes, which shall
never be removed, and the ordinances and institutions of the gospel are
its cords, which shall never be broken. They are things which cannot be
shaken, though heaven and earth be, but shall remain.

6\. God himself will be their protector and Saviour, [Isa
33:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021.md), [Isa
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#022.md). This the principal ground of
their confidence: "He that is himself the glorious Lord will display his
glory for us and be a glory to us, such as shall eclipse the rival-glory
of the enemy." God, in being a gracious Lord, is a glorious Lord; for
his goodness is his glory. God will be the Saviour of Jerusalem and her
glorious Lord, (1.) As a guard against their adversaries abroad. He will
be a place of broad rivers and streams. Jerusalem had no considerable
river running by it, as most great cities have, nothing but the brook
Kidron, and so wanted one of the best natural fortifications, as well as
one of the greatest advantages for trade and commerce, and upon this
account their enemies despised them and doubted not but to make an easy
prey of them; but the presence and power of God are sufficient at any
time to make up to us the deficiencies of the creature and of its
strength and beauty. We have all in God, all we need or can desire. Many
external advantages Jerusalem has not which other places have, but in
God there is more than an equivalent. But, if there be broad rivers and
streams about Jerusalem, may not these yield an easy access to the fleet
of an invader? No; these are rivers and streams in which shall go no
galley with oars, no man of war or gallant ship. If God himself be the
river, it must needs be inaccessible to the enemy; they can neither find
nor force their way by it. (2.) As a guide to their affairs at home:
"For the Lord is our Judge, to whom we are accountable, to whose
judgment we refer ourselves, by whose judgment we abide, and who
therefore (we hope) will judge for us. He is our lawgiver; his word is a
law to us, and to him every thought within us is brought into obedience.
He is our King, to whom we pay homage and tribute, and an inviolable
allegiance, and therefore he will save us." For, as protection draws
allegiance, so allegiance may expect protection, and shall have it with
God. By faith we take Christ for our prince and Saviour, and as such
depend upon him and devote ourselves to him. Observe with what an air of
triumph, and with what an emphasis laid upon the glorious name of God,
they comfort themselves with this: Jehovah is our Judge, Jehovah is our
Lawgiver, Jehovah is our King, who, being self-existent, is
self-sufficient, and all-sufficient to us.

7\. The enemies shall be quite infatuated, and all their powers and
projects broken, like a ship at sea in stress of weather, that cannot
ride out the storm, but having her tackle torn, her masts split, and
nothing wherewith to repair them, is given up for a wreck, [Isa
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#023.md). The tacklings of the Assyrian
are loosed; they are like a ship whose tacklings are loose, or forsaken
by the ship's crew, when they give it over for lost, finding that they
cannot strengthen the mast, but it will come down. They thought
themselves sure of Jerusalem; but when they were just entering the port
as it were, and though all was their own, they were quite becalmed, and
could not spread their sail, but lay wind-bound till God poured the fury
of his wrath upon them. The enemies of God's church are often disarmed
and unrigged when they think they have almost gained their point.

8\. The wealth of their camp shall be a rich booty for the Jews: Then is
the prey of a great spoil divided. When the greater part were slain the
rest fled in confusion, and with such precipitation that (like the
Syrians) they left their tents as they were, so that all the treasure in
them fell into the hands of the besieged; and even the lame take the
prey. Those that tarried at home did divide the spoil. It was so easy to
come at that not only the strong man might make himself master of it,
but even the lame man, whose hands were lame, that he could not fight,
and his feet, that he could not pursue. As the victory shall cost them
no peril, so the prey shall cost them no toil. And there was such
abundance of it that when those who were forward, and came first, had
carried off as much as they would, even the lame, who came late, found
sufficient. Thus God brought good out of evil, and not only delivered
Jerusalem, but enriched it, and abundantly recompensed the losses they
had sustained. Thus comfortably and well do the frights and distresses
of the people of God often end.

9\. Both sickness and sin shall be taken away; and then sickness is
taken away in mercy when this is all the fruit of it, and the recovery
from it, even the taking away of sin. (1.) The inhabitant shall not say,
I am sick. As the lame shall take the prey, so shall the sick,
notwithstanding their weakness, make a shift to get to the abandoned
camp and seize something for themselves; or there shall be such a
universal transport of joy upon this occasion that even the sick shall,
for the present, forget their sickness and the sorrows of it, and join
with the public in its rejoicings; the deliverance of their city shall
be their cure. Or it intimates that, whereas infectious diseases are
commonly the effect of long sieges, it shall not be so with Jerusalem,
but the inhabitants of it with their victory and peace shall have health
also, and there shall be no complaining upon the account of sickness
within their gates. Or those that are sick shall bear their sickness
without complaining as long as they see it goes well with Jerusalem. Our
sense of private grievances should be drowned in our thanksgivings for
public mercies. (2.) The people that dwell therein shall be forgiven
their iniquity, not only the body of the nation forgiven their national
guilt in the removing of the national judgment, but particular persons,
that dwell therein, shall repent, and reform, and have their sins
pardoned. And this is promised as that which is at the bottom of all
other favours; he will do so and so for them, for he will be merciful to
their unrighteousness, [Heb 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#012.md). Sin
is the sickness of the soul. When God pardons the sin he heals the
disease; and, when the diseases of sin are healed by pardoning mercy,
the sting of bodily sickness is taken out and the cause of it removed;
so that either the inhabitant shall not be sick or at least shall not
say, I am sick. If iniquity be taken away, we have little reason to
complain of outward affliction. Son, be of good cheer; thy sins are
forgiven thee.
