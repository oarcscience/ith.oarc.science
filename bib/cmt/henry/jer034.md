### [Jeremiah Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 34:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have two messages which God sent by Jeremiah. I. One
to foretel the fate of Zedekiah king of Judah, that he should fall into
the hands of the king of Babylon, that he should live a captive, but
should at last die in peace in his captivity ([Jer
34:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001).md). II. Another to read the doom
both of prince and people for their treacherous dealings with God, in
bringing back into bondage their servants whom they had released
according to the law, and so playing fast and loose with God. They had
walked at all adventures with God ([Jer
34:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#008).md), and therefore God would walk
at all adventures with them, in bringing the Chaldean army upon them
again when they began to hope that they had got clear of them ([Jer
34:12-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#012).md).

[Jeremiah 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 34:1</span></span>

This prophecy concerning Zedekiah was delivered to Jeremiah, and by him
to the parties concerned, before he was shut up in the prison, for we
find this prediction here made the ground of his commitment, as appears
by the recital of some passages out of it, [Jer
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#004.md). Observe,

I. The time when this message was sent to Zedekiah; it was when the king
of Babylon, with all his forces, some out of all the kingdoms of the
earth that were within his jurisdiction, fought against Jerusalem and
the cities thereof ([Jer 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001).md),
designing to destroy them, having often plundered them. The cities that
now remained, and yet held out, are named ([Jer
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#007).md), Lachish and Azekah. This
intimates that things were now brought to the last extremity, and yet
Zedekiah obstinately stood it out, his heart being hardened to his
destruction.

II\. The message itself that was sent to him. 1. Here is a threatening
of wrath. He is told that again which he had been often told before,
that the city shall be taken by the Chaldeans and burnt with fire ([Jer
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#002).md), that he shall himself fall into
the enemy's hands, shall be made a prisoner, shall be brought before
that furious prince Nebuchadnezzar, and be carried away captive into
Babylon ([Jer 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#003).md); yet Ezekiel
prophesied that he should not see Babylon; nor did he, for his eyes were
put out, [Eze 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013.md). This Zedekiah
brought upon himself from God by his other sins and from Nebuchadnezzar
by breaking his faith with him. 2. Here is a mixture of mercy. He shall
die a captive, but he shall not die by the sword he shall die a natural
death ([Jer 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#004).md); he shall end his
days with some comfort, shall die in peace, [Jer
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#005.md). He never had been one of the
worst of the kings, but we are willing to hope that what evil he had
done in the sight of the Lord he repented of in his captivity, as
Manasseh had done, and it was forgiven to him; and, God being reconciled
to him, he might truly be said to die in peace, Note, A man may die in a
prison and yet die in peace. Nay, he shall end his days with some
reputation, more than one would expect, all things considered. He shall
be buried with the burnings of his fathers, that is, with the respect
usually shown to their kings, especially those that had done good in
Israel. It seems, in his captivity he had conducted himself so well
towards his own people that they were willing to do him this honour, and
towards Nebuchadnezzar that he suffered it to be done. If Zedekiah had
continued in his prosperity, perhaps he would have grown worse and would
have departed at last without being desired; but his afflictions wrought
such a change in him that his death was looked upon as a great loss. It
is better to live and die penitent in a prison than to live and die
impenitent in a palace. They will lament thee, saying, Ah lord! an
honour which his brother Jehoiakim had not, [Jer
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018.md). The Jews say that they lamented
thus over him, Alas! Zedekiah is dead, who drank the dregs of all the
ages that went before him, that is, who suffered for the sins of his
ancestors, the measure of iniquity being filled up in his days. They
shall thus lament him, saith the Lord, for I have pronounced the word;
and what God hath spoken shall without fail be made good.

III\. Jeremiah's faithfulness in delivering this message. Though he knew
it would be ungrateful to the king, and might prove, as indeed it did,
dangerous to himself (for he was imprisoned for it), yet he spoke all
these words to Zedekiah, [Jer 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#006.md). It
is a mercy to great men to have those about them that will deal
faithfully with them, and tell them the evil consequences of their evil
courses, that they may reform and live.

[Jeremiah 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 34:8</span></span>

We have here another prophecy upon a particular occasion, the history of
which we must take notice of, as necessary to give light to the
prophecy.

I. When Jerusalem was closely besieged by the Chaldean army the princes
and people agreed upon a reformation in one instance, and that was
concerning their servants.

1\. The law of God was very express, that those of their own nation
should not be held in servitude above seven years, but, after they had
served one apprenticeship, they should be discharged and have their
liberty; yea, though they had sold themselves into servitude for the
payment of their debts, or though they were sold by the judges for the
punishment of their crimes. This difference was put between their
brethren and strangers, that those of other nations taken in war, or
bought with money, might be held in perpetual slavery, they and theirs;
but their brethren must serve but for seven years at the longest. This
God calls the covenant that he had made with them when he brought them
out of the land of Egypt, [Jer 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#013.md),
[Jer 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#014.md). This was the first of the
judicial laws which God gave them ([Exo
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#002).md), and there was good reason for
this law. (1.) God had put honour upon that nation, and he would have
them thus to preserve the honour of it themselves and to put a
difference between it and other nations. (2.) God had brought them out
of slavery in Egypt, and he would have them thus to express their
grateful sense of that favour, by letting those go to whom their houses
were houses of bondage, as Egypt had been to their forefathers. That
deliverance is therefore mentioned here ([Jer
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#013).md) as the ground of that law.
Note, God's compassions towards us should engage our compassions towards
our brethren; we must release as we are released, forgive as we are
forgiven, and relieve as we are relieved. And this is called a covenant;
for our performance of the duty required is the condition of the
continuance of the favours God has bestowed.

2\. This law they and their fathers had broken. Their worldly profit
swayed more with them than God's command or covenant. When their
servants had lived seven years with them they understood their business,
and how to apply themselves to it, better than they did when they first
came to them, and therefore they would then by no means part with them,
though God himself by his law had made them free: Your fathers hearkened
not to me in this matter ([Jer 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#014).md),
so that from the days of their fathers they had been in this trespass;
and they thought they might do it because their fathers did it, and
their servants had by disuse lost the benefit of the provision God made
for them; whereas against an express law, especially against an express
law of God, no custom, usage, nor prescription, is to be admitted in
plea. For this sin of theirs, and their fathers, God now brought them
into servitude, and justly.

3\. When they were besieged, and closely shut in, by the army of the
Chaldeans, they, being told of their fault in this matter, immediately
reformed, and let go all their servants that were entitled to their
freedom by the law of God, as Pharaoh, who, when the plague was upon
him, consented to let the people go, and bound themselves in a covenant
to do so. (1.) The prophets faithfully admonished them concerning their
sin. From them they heard that they should let their Hebrew servants go
free, [Jer 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#010.md). They might have read
it themselves in the book of the law, but did not, or did not heed it,
therefore the prophets told them what the law was. See what need there
is of the preaching of the word; people must hear the word preached
because they will not make the use they ought to make of the word
written. (2.) All orders and degrees of men concurred in this
reformation. The king, and the princes, and all the people, agreed to
let go their servants, whatever loss or damage they might sustain by so
doing. When the king and princes led in this good work the people could
not for shame but follow. The example and influence of great men would
go very far towards extirpating the most inveterate corruptions. (3.)
They bound themselves by a solemn oath and covenant that they would do
this, whereby they engaged themselves to God and one another. Note, What
God has bound us to by his precept, it is good for us to bind ourselves
to by our promise. This covenant was very solemn: it was made in a
sacred place, made before me, in the house which is called by my name
([Jer 34:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#015).md), in the special presence
of God, the tokens of which, in the temple, ought to strike an awe upon
them and make them very sincere in their appeals to him. It was ratified
by a significant sign; they cut a calf in two, and passed between the
parts thereof ([Jer 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#018.md), [Jer
34:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#019).md) with this dreadful imprecation,
"Let us be in like manner cut asunder if we do not perform what we now
promise." This calf was probably offered up in sacrifice to God, who was
thereby made a party to the covenant. When God covenanted with Abraham,
for the ratification of it, a smoking furnace and a burning lamp passed
between the pieces of the sacrifice, in allusion to this federal rite,
[Gen 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#017.md). Note, In order that we may
effectually oblige ourselves to our duty, it is good to alarm ourselves
with the apprehensions of the terror of the wrath and curse to which we
expose ourselves if we live in the contempt of it, that wrath which will
cut sinners asunder ([Mat 24:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#051).md), and
sensible signs may be of use to make the impressions of it deep and
durable, as here. (4.) They conformed themselves herein to the command
of God and their covenant with him; they did let their servants go,
though at this time, when the city was besieged, they could very ill
spare them. Thus they did right in God's sight, [Jer
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#015.md). Though it was their trouble
that drove them to it, yet he was well pleased with it; and if they had
persevered in this act of mercy to the poor, to their poor servants, it
might have been a lengthening of their tranquillity, [Dan
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#027.md).

II\. When there was some hope that the siege was raised and the danger
over they repented of their repentance, undid the good they had done,
and forced the servants they had released into their respective services
again. 1. The king of Babylon's army had now gone up from them, [Jer
34:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#021.md). Pharaoh was bringing an army of
Egyptians to oppose the progress of the king of Babylon's victories,
upon the tidings of which the Chaldeans raised the siege for a time, as
we find, [Jer 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005.md). They departed from
Jerusalem. See how ready God was to put a stop to his judgments, upon
the first instance of reformation, so slow is he to anger and so swift
to show mercy. As soon as ever they let their servants go free God let
them go free. 2. When they began to think themselves safe from the
besiegers they made their servants come back into subjection to them,
[Jer 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#011.md), and again [Jer
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#016.md). This was a great abuse to their
servants, to whom servitude would be more irksome, after they had had
some taste of the pleasures of liberty. It was a great shame to
themselves that they could not keep in a good mind when they were in it.
But it was especially an affront to God; in doing this they polluted his
name, [Jer 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#016.md). It was a contempt of
the command he had given them, as if that were of no force at all, but
they might either keep it or break it as they thought fit. It was a
contempt of the covenant they had made with him, and of that wrath which
they had imprecated upon themselves in case they should break that
covenant. It was jesting with God almighty, as if he could be imposed
upon by fallacious promises, which, when they had gained their point,
they would look upon themselves no longer obliged by. it was lying to
God with their mouths and flattering him with their tongues. It was
likewise a contempt of the judgments of God and setting them at
defiance; as if, when once the course of them was stopped a little and
interrupted, they would never proceed again and the judgment would never
be revived; whereas reprieves are so far from being pardons that if they
be abused thus, and sinners take encouragement from them to return to
sin, they are but preparatives for heavier strokes of divine vengeance.

III\. For this treacherous dealing with God they are here severely
threatened. Be not deceived; God is not mocked. Those that think to put
a cheat upon God by a dissembled repentance, a fallacious covenant, and
a partial temporary reformation, will prove in the end to have put the
greatest cheat upon their own souls; for the Lord, whose name is
Jealous, is a jealous God. it is here threatened, with an observable air
of displeasure against them, 1. That, since they had not given liberty
to their servants to go where they pleased, God would give all his
judgments liberty to take their course against them without control
([Jer 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#017).md): You have not proclaimed
liberty to your servants. Though they had done it ([Jer
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#010).md), yet they might truly be said
not to have done it, because they did not stand to it, but undid it
again; and factum non dicitur quod non perseverat - that is not said to
be done which does not last. The righteousness that is forsaken and
turned away from shall be forgotten, and not mentioned any more than if
it had never been, [Eze 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#024.md).
"Therefore I will proclaim a liberty for you; I will discharge you from
my service, and put you out of my protection, which those forfeit that
withdraw from their allegiance. You shall have liberty to choose which
of these judgments you will be cut off by, sword, famine, or
pestilence;" such a liberty as was offered to David, which put him into
a great strait, [Sa2 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#014.md). Note,
Those that will not be in subjection to the law of God put themselves
into subjection to the wrath and curse of God. But this shows what
liberty to sin really - it is but a liberty to the sorest judgments. 2.
That, since they had brought their servants back into confinement in
their houses, God would make them to be removed into all the kingdoms of
the earth, where they should live in servitude, and, being strangers,
could not expect the privileges of free-born subjects. 3. That, since
they had broken the covenant which they ratified by a solemn
imprecation, God would bring on them the evil which they imprecated upon
themselves in case they should break it. out of their own mouth will he
judge them, and so shall their doom be; the penalty of their bond shall
be recovered, because they have not performed the condition; for so some
read [Jer 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#018.md), "I will make the men
which have transgressed my covenant as the calf which they cut in twain;
I will divide them asunder as they divided it asunder." 4. That, since
they would not let go their servants out of the hands, God would deliver
them into the hands of those that hated them, even the princes and
nobles both of Judah and Jerusalem (of the country and of the city), the
eunuchs (chamberlains, or great officers of the court), the priests, and
all the people, [Jer 34:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#019.md). They had
all dealt treacherously with God, and therefore shall all be involved in
the common ruin without exception. They shall all be given unto the hand
of their enemies, that seek, not their wealth only, or their service,
but their life, and they shall have what they seek; but neither shall
that content them: when they have their lives they shall leave their
dead bodies unburied, a loathsome spectacle to all mankind and an easy
prey to the fowls and beasts, a lasting mark of ignominy being hereby
fastened on them, [Jer 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#020.md). 5. That,
since they had emboldened themselves in returning to their sin, contrary
to their covenant, by the retreat of the Chaldean army from them, God
would therefore bring it upon them again: "They have now gone up from
you, and your fright is over for the present, but I will command them to
face about as they were; they shall return to this city, and take it and
burn it," [Jer 34:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#022). Note, (1..md) As
confidence in God is a hopeful presage of approaching deliverance, so
security in sin is a sad omen of approaching destruction. (2.) When
judgments are removed from a people before they have done their work,
leave them, but leave them unhumbled and unreformed, it is cum animo
revertendi - with a design to return; they do but retreat to come on
again with so much the greater force; for when God judges he will
overcome. (3.) It is just with God to disappoint those expectations of
mercy which his providence had given cause for when we disappoint those
expectations of duty which our professions, pretensions, and fair
promises, had given cause for. If we repent of the good we had purposed,
God will repent of the good he had purposed. With the froward thou will
show thyself froward.
