### [Exodus Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 35:0</span></span>

What should have been said and done upon Moses' coming down the first
time from the mount, if the golden calf had not broken the measures and
put all into disorder, now at last, when with great difficulty
reconciliation was made, begins to be said and done; and that great
affair of the setting up of God's worship is put into its former channel
again, and goes on now without interruption. I. Moses gives Israel those
instructions, received from God, which required immediate observance. 1.
Concerning the sabbath ([Exo 35:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#001).md).
2. Concerning the contribution that was to be made for the erecting of
the tabernacle ([Exo 35:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#004).md). 3.
Concerning the framing of the tabernacle and the utensils of it ([Exo
35:10-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#010).md). II. The people bring in
their contributions ([Exo 35:20-29](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#020).md).
III. The head-workmen are nominated ([Exo
35:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#030), etc..md).

[Exodus 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 35:1</span></span>

It was said in general ([Exo 34:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#032).md),
Moses gave them in commandment all that the Lord has spoken with him.
But, the erecting and furnishing of the tabernacle being the work to
which they were now immediately to apply themselves, there is particular
mention of the orders given concerning it.

I. All the congregation is summoned to attend ([Exo
35:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#001).md); that is, the heads and rulers
of the congregation, the representatives of the several tribes, who must
receive instructions from Moses as he had received them from the Lord,
and must communicate them to the people. Thus John, being commanded to
write to the seven churches what had been revealed to him, writes it to
the angels, or ministers, of the churches.

II\. Moses gave them in charge all that (and that only) which God had
commanded him; thus he approved himself faithful both to God and Israel,
between whom he was a messenger or mediator. If he had added, altered,
or diminished, he would have been false to both. But, both sides having
reposed a trust in him, he was true to the trust; yet he was faithful as
a servant only, but Christ as a Son, [Heb
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#005.md), [Heb
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006.md).

III\. He begins with the law of the sabbath, because that was much
insisted on in the instructions he had received ([Exo
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#002.md), [Exo
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#003).md): Six days shall work be done,
work for the tabernacle, the work of the day that was now to be done in
its day; and they had little else to do here in the wilderness, where
they had neither husbandry nor merchandise, neither food to get nor
clothes to make: but on the seventh day you must not strike a stroke,
no, not at the tabernacle-work; the honour of the sabbath was above that
of the sanctuary, more ancient and more lasting; that must be to you a
holy day, devoted to God, and not be spent in common business. It is a
sabbath of rest. It is a sabbath of sabbaths (so some read it), more
honourable and excellent than any of the other feasts, and should
survive them all. A sabbath of sabbatism, so others read it, being
typical of that sabbatism or rest, both spiritual and eternal, which
remains for the people of God, [Heb
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#009.md). It is a sabbath of rest, that is,
in which a rest from all worldly labour must be very carefully and
strictly observed. It is a sabbath and a little sabbath, so some of the
Jews would have it read; not only observing the whole day as a sabbath,
but an hour before the beginning of it, and an hour after the ending of
it, which they throw in over and above out of their own time, and call a
little sabbath, to show how glad they are of the approach of the sabbath
and how loth to part with it. It is a sabbath of rest, but it is rest to
the Lord, to whose honour it must be devoted. A penalty is here annexed
to the breach of it: Whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death.
Also a particular prohibition of kindling fires on the sabbath day for
any servile work, as smith's work, or plumbers, etc.

IV\. He orders preparation to be made for the setting up of the
tabernacle. Two things were to be done: -

1\. All that were able must contribute: Take you from among you an
offering, [Exo 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#005.md). The tabernacle
was to be dedicated to the honour of God, and used in his service; and
therefore what was brought for the setting up and furnishing of that was
an offering to the Lord. Our goodness extends not to God, but what is
laid out for the support of his kingdom and interest among men he is
pleased to accept as an offering to himself; and he requires such
acknowledgements of our receiving our all from him and such instances of
our dedicating our all to him. The rule is, Whosoever is of a willing
heart let him bring. It was not to be a tax imposed upon them, but a
benevolence or voluntary contribution, to intimate to us, (1.) That God
has not made our yoke heavy. He is a prince that does not burden his
subjects with taxes, nor make them to serve with an offering, but draws
with the cords of a man, and leaves it to ourselves to judge what is
right; his is a government that there is no cause to complain of, for he
does not rule with rigour. (2.) That God loves a cheerful giver, and is
best pleased with the free-will offering. Those services are acceptable
to him that come from the willing heart of a willing people, [Psa
110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md).

2\. All that were skilful must work: Every wise-hearted among you shall
come, and make, [Exo 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#010.md). See how
God dispenses his gifts variously; and, as every man hath received the
gift, so he must minister, [Pe1 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#010.md).
Those that were rich must bring in materials to work on; those that were
ingenious must serve the tabernacle with their ingenuity; as they needed
one another, so the tabernacle needed them both, [Co1
12:7-21](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#007.md). The work was likely to go on
when some helped with their purses, others with their hands, and both
with a willing heart. Moses, as he had told them what must be given
([Exo 35:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#005).md), so he gives them the
general heads of what must be made ([Exo
35:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#011).md), that, seeing how much work
was before them, they might apply themselves to it the more vigorously,
and every hand might be busy; and it gave them such an idea of the
fabric designed that they could not but long to see it finished.

[Exodus 35:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 35:20</span></span>

Moses having made known to them the will of God, they went home and
immediately put in practice what they had heard, [Exo
35:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#020.md). O that every congregation would
thus depart from the hearing of the word of God, with a full resolution
to be doers of the same! Observe here,

I. The offerings that were brought for the service of the tabernacle
([Exo 35:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#021), etc..md), concerning which
many things may be noted. 1. It is intimated that they brought their
offerings immediately; they departed to their tents immediately to fetch
their offering, and did not desire time to consider of it, lest their
zeal should be cooled by delays. What duty God convinces us of, and
calls us to, we should set about speedily. No season will be more
convenient than the present season. 2. It is said that their spirits
made them willing ([Exo 35:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#021).md), and
their hearts, [Exo 35:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#029.md). What they
did they did cheerfully, and from a good principle. They were willing,
and it was not any external inducement that made them so, but their
spirits. It was from a principle of love to God and his service, a
desire of his presence with them in his ordinances, gratitude for the
great things he had done for them, faith in his promise of what he would
further do (or, at least, from the present consideration of these
things), that they were willing to offer. What we give and do for God is
then acceptable when it comes from a good principle in the heart and
spirit. 3. When it is said that as many as were willing-hearted brought
their offerings ([Exo 35:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#022).md), it
should seem as if there were some who were not, who loved their gold
better than their God, and would not part with it, no, not for the
service of the tabernacle. Such there are, who will be called
Israelites, and yet will not be moved by the equity of the thing, God's
expectations from them, and the good examples of those about them, to
part with any thing for the interests of God's kingdom: they are for the
true religion, provided it be cheap and will cost them nothing. 4. The
offerings were of divers kinds, according as they had; those that had
gold and precious stones brought them, not thinking any thing too good
and too rich to part with for the honour of God. Those that had not
precious stones to bring brought goats' hair, and rams' skins. If we
cannot do as much as others for God, we must not therefore sit still and
do nothing: if the meaner offerings which are according to our ability
gain us not such a reputation among men, yet they shall not fail of
acceptance with God, who requires according to what a man hath, and not
according to what he hath not, [Co2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#012.md); [Kg2
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#023.md). Two mites from a pauper were
more pleasing than so many talents from a Dives. God has an eye to the
heart of the giver more than to the value of the gift. 5. Many of the
things they offered were their ornaments, bracelets and rings, and
tablets or lockets ([Exo 35:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#022).md); and
even the women parted with these. Can a maid forget her ornaments? Thus
far they forgot them that they preferred the beautifying of the
sanctuary before their own adorning. Let this teach us, in general, to
part with that for God, when he calls for it, which is very dear to us,
which we value, and value ourselves by; and particularly to lay aside
our ornaments, and deny ourselves in them, when either they occasion
offence to others or feed our own pride. If we think those gospel rules
concerning our clothing too strict ([Ti1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009.md), [Ti1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#010.md); [Pe1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#003.md), [Pe1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#004).md), I fear we should scarcely have
done as these Israelites did. If they thought their ornaments well
bestowed upon the tabernacle, shall not we think the want of ornaments
well made up by the graces of the Spirit? [Pro
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#009.md). 6. These rich things that they
offered, we may suppose, were mostly the spoils of the Egyptians; for
the Israelites in Egypt were kept poor, till they borrowed at parting.
And we may suppose the rulers had better things ([Exo
35:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#027).md), because, having more influence
among the Egyptians, they borrowed larger sums. Who would have thought
that ever the wealth of Egypt should have been so well employed? but
thus God has often made the earth to help the woman, [Rev
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#016.md). It was by a special providence
and promise of God that the Israelites got all that spoil, and therefore
it was highly fit that they should devote a part of it to the service of
that God to whom they owed it all. Let every man give according as God
hath prospered him, [Co1 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#002.md).
Extraordinary successes should be acknowledged by extraordinary
offerings. Apply it to human learning, arts and sciences, which are
borrowed, as it were, from the Egyptians. Those that are enriched with
these must devote them to the service of God and his tabernacle: they
may be used as helps to understand the scriptures, as ornaments or
handmaids to divinity. But then great care must be taken that Egypt's
gods mingle not with Egypt's gold. Moses, though learned in all the
learning of the Egyptians, did not therefore pretend, in the least
instance, to correct the pattern shown him in the mount. The furnishing
of the tabernacle with the riches of Egypt was perhaps a good omen to
the Gentiles, who, in the fulness of time, should be brought into the
gospel tabernacle, and their silver and their gold with them ([Isa
60:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#009).md), and it should be said, Blessed
be Egypt my people, [Isa 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#025.md). 7. We
may suppose that the remembrance of the offerings made for the golden
calf made them the more forward in these offerings. Those that had then
parted with their ear-rings would not testify their repentance by giving
the rest of their jewels to the service of God: godly sorrow worketh
such a revenge, [Co2 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011.md). And those
that had kept themselves pure from that idolatry yet argued with
themselves, "Were they so forward in contributing to an idol, and shall
we be backward or sneaking in our offerings to the Lord?" Thus some good
was brought even out of that evil.

II\. The work that was done for the service of the tabernacle ([Exo
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#025).md): The women did spin with their
hands. Some spun fine work, of blue and purple; others coarse work, of
goats' hair, and yet theirs also is said to be done in wisdom, [Exo
35:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#026.md). As it is not only rich gifts,
so it is not only fine work that God accepts. Notice is here taken of
the good women's work for God, as well as of Bezaleel's and Aholiab's.
The meanest hand for the honour of God, shall have an honourable
recompence. Mary's anointing of Christ's head shall be told for a
memorial ([Mat 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#013).md); and a record is
kept of the women that laboured in the gospel tabernacle ([Phi
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003).md), and were helpers to Paul in
Christ Jesus, [Rom 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003.md). It is part of
the character of the virtuous woman that she layeth her hands to the
spindle, [Pro 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#019.md). This employment
was here turned to a pious use, as it may be still (though we have no
hangings to make for the tabernacle) by the imitation of the charity of
Dorcas, who made coats and garments for poor widows, [Act
9:39](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#039.md). Even those that are not in a
capacity to give in charity may yet work in charity; and thus the poor
may relieve the poor, and those that have nothing but their limbs and
senses may be very charitable in the labour of love.

[Exodus 35:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">exo 35:30</span></span>

Here is the divine appointment of the master-workmen, that there might
be no strife for the office, and that all who were employed in the work
might take direction from, and give account to, these general
inspectors; for God is the God of order and not of confusion. Observe,
1. Those whom God called by name to this service he filled with the
Spirit of God, to qualify them for it, [Exo
35:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#030.md), [Exo
35:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#031.md). Skill in secular employments is
God's gift, and comes from above, [Jam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017.md). From him the faculty is, and the
improvement of it. To his honour therefore all knowledge must be
devoted, and we must study how to serve him with it. The work was
extraordinary which Bezaleel was designed for, and therefore he was
qualified in an extraordinary manner for it; thus when the apostles were
appointed to be master-builders in setting up the gospel tabernacle they
were filled with the Spirit of God in wisdom and understanding. 2. The
were appointed, not only to devise, but to work ([Exo
35:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#032).md), to work all manner of work,
[Exo 35:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#035.md). Those of eminent gifts,
that are capable of directing others, must not thing that these will
excuse them in idleness. Many are ingenious enough in cutting out work
for other people, and can tell what this man and that man should do, but
the burdens they ind on others they themselves will not touch with one
of their fingers. These will fall under the character of slothful
servants. 3. They were not only to devise and work themselves, but they
were to teach others, [Exo 35:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#034.md). Not
only had Bezaleel power to command, but he was to take pains to
instruct. Those that rule should teach; and those to whom God had given
knowledge should be willing to communicate it for the benefit of others,
not coveting to monopolize it.
