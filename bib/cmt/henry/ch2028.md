### [2 Chronicles Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 28:0</span></span>

This chapter is the history of the reign of Ahaz the son of Jotham; a
bad reign it was, and which helped to augment the fierce anger of the
Lord. We have here, I. His great wickedness ([Ch2
28:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001).md). II. The trouble he brought
himself into by it ([Ch2 28:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#005).md). III.
The reproof which God sent by a prophet to the army of Israel for
trampling upon their brethren of Judah, and the obedient ear they gave
to that reproof ([Ch2 28:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#009).md). IV.
The many calamities that followed to Ahaz and his people ([Ch2
28:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#016).md). V. The continuance of his
idolatry notwithstanding ([Ch2
28:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#022).md), and so his story ends ([Ch2
28:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#026.md), [Ch2
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#027).md).

[2 Chronicles 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 28:1</span></span>

Never surely had a man greater opportunity of doing well than Ahaz had,
finding things in a good posture, the kingdom rich and strong and
religion established; and yet here we have him in these few verses, 1.
Wretchedly corrupted and debauched. He had had a good education given
him and a good example set him: but parents cannot give grace to their
children. All the instructions he had were lost upon him: He did not
that which was right in the sight of the Lord ([Ch2
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001).md), nay, he did a great deal that
was wrong, a wrong to God, to his own soul, and to his people; he walked
in the way of the revolted Israelites and the devoted Canaanites, made
molten images and worshipped them, contrary to the second commandment;
nay, he made them for Baalim, contrary to the first commandment. he
forsook the temple of the Lord and sacrificed and burnt incense on the
hills, as if they would place him nearer heaven, and under every green
tree, as if they would signify the protection and influence of heaven by
their shade and dropping. To complete his wickedness, as one perfectly
divested of all natural affection as well as religion and perfectly
devoted to the service and interest of the great enemy of mankind, he
burnt his children in the fire to Moloch ([Ch2
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#003).md), not thinking it enough to
dedicate them to that infernal fiend by causing them to pass through the
fire. See what an absolute sway the prince of the power of the air bears
among the children of disobedience. 2. Wretchedly spoiled and made a
prey of. When he forsook God, and at a vast expense put himself under
the protection of false gods, God, who of right was his God, delivered
him into the hands of his enemies, [Ch2
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#005). (1..md) The Syrians insulted him
and triumphed over him, beat him in the field and carried away a great
many of his people into captivity. (2.) The king of Israel, though an
idolater too, was made a scourge to him, and smote him with a great
slaughter. The people suffered by these judgments: their blood was shed,
their country wasted, their families ruined; for when they had a good
king, though they did corruptly ([Ch2
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#002).md), yet then his goodness sheltered
them; but now that they had a bad one all the defence had departed from
them and an inundation of judgments broke in upon them. Those that knew
not their happiness in the foregoing reign were taught to value it by
the miseries of this reign.

[2 Chronicles 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 28:6</span></span>

We have here,

I. Treacherous Judah under the rebukes of God's providence, and they are
very severe. Never was such bloody work made among them since they were
a kingdom, and by Israelites too. Ahaz walked in the ways of the kings
of Israel, and the king of Israel was the instrument God made use of for
his punishment. It is just with God to make those our plagues whom we
make our patterns or make ourselves partners with in sin. A war broke
out between Judah and Israel, in which Judah was worsted. For, 1. There
was a great slaughter of men in the field of battle. Vast numbers
(120,000 men, and valiant men too at other times) were slain ([Ch2
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#006).md) and some of the first rank, the
king's son for one. He had sacrificed some of this sons to Moloch;
justly therefore is this sacrificed to the divine vengeance. Here is
another that was next the king, his friend, the prime-minister of state,
or perhaps next him in the battle, so that the king himself had a narrow
escape, [Ch2 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#007.md). The kingdom of
Israel was not strong at this time, and yet strong enough to bring this
great destruction upon Judah. But certainly so many men, great men,
stout men, could not have been cut off in one day if they had not been
strangely dispirited both by the consciousness of their own guilt and by
the righteous hand of God upon them. Even valiant men were numbered as
sheep for the slaughter, and became an easy prey to the enemy because
they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers, and he had therefore
forsaken them. 2. There was a great captivity of women and children,
[Ch2 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#008.md). When the army in the field
was routed, the cities, and towns, and country villages, were all easily
stripped, the inhabitants taken for slaves, and their wealth for a prey.

II\. Even victorious Israel under the rebuke of God's word for the bad
principle they had gone upon in making war with Judah and the bad use
they had made of their success, and the good effect of this rebuke. Here
is,

1\. The message which God sent them by a prophet, who went out to meet
them, not to applaud their valour or congratulate them on their victory,
though they returned laden with spoils and triumphs, but in God's name
to tell them of their faults and warn them of the judgments of God.

(1.) He told them how they came by this victory of which they were so
proud. It was not because God favoured them, or that they had merited it
at his hand, but because he was wroth with Judah, and made them the rod
of his indignation. Not for your righteousness, be it known to you, but
for their wickedness ([Deu 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#005).md) they
are broken off; therefore be not you high-minded, but fear lest God also
spare not you, [Rom 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#020.md), [Rom
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#021.md).

(2.) He charged them with the abuse of the power God had given them over
their brethren. Those understand not what victory is who think it gives
them authority to do what they will, and that the longest sword is the
clearest claim to lives and estates (Jusque datum sceleri - might is
right); no, as it is impolitic not to use a victory, so it is impious to
abuse it. The conquerors are here reproved, \[1.\] For the cruelty of
the slaughter they had made in the field. They had indeed shed the blood
of war in war; we suppose that to be lawful, but it turned into sin to
them, because they did it from a bad principle of enmity to their
brethren and after a bad manner, with a barbarous fury, a rage reaching
up to heaven, that is, that cried to God for vengeance against such
bloody men, that delighted in military execution. Those that serve God's
justice, if they do it with rage and a spirit of revenge, make
themselves obnoxious to it, and forfeit the honour of acting for him;
for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. \[2.\] For
the imperious treatment they gave their prisoners. "You now purpose to
keep them under, to use them or sell them as slaves, though they are
your brethren and free-born Israelites." God takes notice of what men
purpose, as well as of what they say and do.

(3.) He reminded them of their own sins, by which they also were
obnoxious to the wrath of God: Are there not with you, even with you,
sins against the Lord your God? [Ch2
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#010.md). He appeals to their own
consciences, and to the notorious evidence of the thing. "Though you are
now made the instruments of correcting Judah for sin, yet do not think
that you are therefore innocent yourselves; no, you also are guilty
before God." This is intended as a check, \[1.\] To their triumph in
their success. "You are sinners, and it ill becomes sinners to be proud;
you have carried the day now, but be not secure, the wheel may ere long
return upon yourselves, for, if judgment begin thus with those that have
the house of God among them, what shall be the end of such as worship
the calves?" \[2.\] To their severity towards their brethren. "You have
now got them under, but you ought to show mercy to them, for you
yourselves are undone if you do not find mercy with God. It ill becomes
sinners to be cruel. You have transgressions enough to answer for
already, and need not add this to the rest."

(4.) He commanded them to release the prisoners, and to send them home
again carefully ([Ch2 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#011).md); "for you
having sinned, the fierce wrath of God is upon you, and there is no
other way of escaping it than by showing mercy."

2\. The resolution of the princes thereupon not to detain the prisoners.
They stood up against those that came from the war, though flushed with
victory, and told them plainly that they should not bring their captives
into Samaria, [Ch2 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#012.md), [Ch2
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#013.md). They had sin enough already to
answer for, and would have nothing done to add to their trespass. In
this they discovered an obedient regard to the word of God by his
prophet and a tender compassion towards their brethren, which was
wrought in them by the tender mercy of God; for he regarded the
affliction of this poor people, and hears their cry, and made them to be
pitied of all those that carried them captive, [Psa
106:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#044.md), [Psa
106:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#046.md).

3\. The compliance of the soldiers with the resolutions of the princes
in this matter, and the dismission of the captives thereupon. (1.) The
armed men, though being armed they might be force have maintained their
title to what they got by the sword, acquiesced, and left their captives
and the spoil to the disposal of the princes ([Ch2
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#014).md), and herein they showed more
truly heroic bravery than they did in taking them. It is a great honour
for any man to yield to the authority of reason and religion against his
interest. (2.) The princes very generously sent home the poor captives
well accommodated, [Ch2 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#015.md). Those
that hope to find mercy with God must learn hence with what tenderness
to carry themselves towards those that lie at their mercy. It is strange
that these princes, who in this instance discovered such a deference to
the word of God, and such an influence upon the people, had not so much
grace as, in obedience to the calls of God by so many prophets, to root
idolatry out of their kingdom, which, soon after this, was the ruin of
it.

[2 Chronicles 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 28:16</span></span>

Here is, I. The great distress which the kingdom of Ahaz was reduced to
for his sin. In general, 1. The Lord brought Judah low, [Ch2
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#019.md). They had lately been very high
in wealth and power; but God found means to bring them down, and make
them as despicable as they had been formidable. Those that will not
humble themselves under the word of God will justly be humbled by his
judgments. Iniquity brings men low, [Psa
106:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#043.md). 2. Ahaz made Judah naked. As
his sin debased them, so it exposed them. It made them naked to their
shame; for it exposed them to contempt, as a man unclothed. It made them
naked to their danger; for it exposed them to assaults, as a man
unarmed, [Exo 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#025.md). Sin strips men.
In particular, the Edomites, to be revenged for Amaziah's cruel
treatment of them ([Ch2 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#012).md), smote
Judah, and carried off many captives, [Ch2
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#017.md). The Philistines also insulted
them, took and kept possession of several cities and villages that lay
near them ([Ch2 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018).md), and so they
were revenged for the incursions which Uzziah had made upon them, [Ch2
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006.md). And, to show that it was purely
the sin of Ahaz that brought the Philistines upon his country, in the
very year that he died the prophet Isaiah foretold the destruction of
the Philistines by his son, [Isa
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#028.md), [Isa
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#029.md).

II\. The addition which Ahaz made both to the national distress and the
national guilt.

1\. He added to the distress, by making court to strange kings, in hopes
they would relieve him. When the Edomites and Philistines were vexatious
to him, he sent to the kings of Assyria to help him ([Ch2
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#016).md); for he found his own kingdom
weakened and made naked, and he could not put any confidence in God, and
therefore was at a vast expense to get an interest in the king of
Assyria. He pillaged the house of God, and the king's house, and
squeezed the princes for money to hire these foreign forces into his
service, [Ch2 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#021.md). Though he had
conformed to the idolatry of the heathen nations, his neighbours, they
did not value him for that, nor love him the better, nor did his
compliance, by which he lost God, gain them, nor could he make any
interest in them, but with his money. It is often found that wicked men
themselves have no real affection for those that revolt to them, nor do
they care to do them a kindness. A degenerate branch is looked upon, on
all sides, as an abominable branch, [Isa
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#019.md). But what did Ahaz get by the
king of Assyria? Why, he came to him, but he distressed him, and
strengthened him not ([Ch2 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#020).md),
helped him not, [Ch2 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#021.md). The forces
of the Assyrian quartered upon his country, and so impoverished and
weakened it; they grew insolent and imperious, and created him a great
deal of vexation, like a broken reed, which not only fails, but pierces
the hand.

2\. He added to the guilt, by making court to strange gods, in hopes
they would relieve him. In his distress, instead of repenting of his
idolatry, which he had reason enough to see the folly of, he trespassed
yet more ([Ch2 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#022).md), was more mad
than ever upon his idols. A brand of infamy is here set upon him for it:
This is that king Ahaz, that wretched man, who was the scandal of the
house of David and the curse and plague of his generation. Note, Those
are wicked and vile indeed that are made worse by their afflictions,
instead of being made better by them, who in their distress trespass yet
more, have their corruptions exasperated by that which should mollify
them, and their hearts more fully set in them to do evil. Let us see
what his trespass was. (1.) He abused the house of God; for he cut in
pieces the vessels of it, that the priests might not perform the service
of the temple, or not as it should be performed, for want of vessels;
and, at length, he shut up the doors, that the people might not attend
it, [Ch2 28:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#024.md). This was worse than
the worst of the kings before him had done. (2.) He confronted the altar
of God, for he made himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem; so
that, as the prophet speaks, they were like heaps in the furrows of the
fields, [Hos 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011.md). And in the cities
of Judah, either by his power or by his purse, perhaps by both, he
erected high places for the people to burn incense to what idols they
pleased, as if on purpose to provoke the God of his fathers, [Ch2
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#025). (3..md) He cast off God himself;
for he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus ([Ch2
28:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#023).md), not because he loved them, for
he thought they smote him; but because he feared them, thinking that
they helped his enemies, and that, if he could bring them into his
interest, they would help him. Foolish man! It was his own God that
smote him and strengthened the Syrians against him, not the gods of
Damascus; had he sacrificed to him, and to him only, he would have
helped him. But no marvel that men's affections and devotions are
misplaced when they mistake the author of their trouble and their help.
And what comes of it? The gods of Syria befriend Ahaz no more than the
kings of Assyria did; they were the ruin of him and of all Israel. This
sin provoked God to bring judgments upon them, to cut him off in the
midst of his days, when he was but thirty-six years old; and it
debauched the people so that the reformation of the next reign could not
prevail to cure them of their inclination to idolatry, but they retained
that root of bitterness till the captivity in Babylon plucked it up.

The chapter concludes with the conclusion of the reign of Ahaz, [Ch2
28:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#026.md), [Ch2
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#027.md). For aught that appears, he died
impenitent, and therefore died inglorious; for he was not buried in the
sepulchres of the kings. Justly was he thought unworthy to be laid among
them who was so unlike them - to be buried with kings who had used his
kingly power for the destruction of the church and not for its
protection or edification.
