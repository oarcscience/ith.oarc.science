### [Jeremiah Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 38:0</span></span>

In this chapter, just as in the former, we have Jeremiah greatly debased
under the frowns of the princes, and yet greatly honoured by the favour
of the king. They used him as a criminal; he used him as a
privy-counsellor. Here, I. Jeremiah for his faithfulness is put into the
dungeon by the princes ([Jer 38:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001).md).
II. At the intercession of Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, by special order
from the king, he is taken up out of the dungeon and confined only to
the court of the prison ([Jer
38:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#007).md). III. He has a private
conference with the king upon the present conjuncture of affairs ([Jer
38:14-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#014).md). IV. Care is taken to keep
that conference private ([Jer
38:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#024).md).

[Jeremiah 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 38:1</span></span>

Here, 1. Jeremiah persists in his plain preaching; what he had many a
time said, he still says ([Jer 38:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#003).md):
This city shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon; though it
hold out long, it will taken at last. Nor would he have so often
repeated this unwelcome message but that he could put them in a certain
way, though not to save the city, yet to save themselves; so that every
man might have his own life given him for a prey if he would be advised,
[Jer 38:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#002.md). Let him not stay in the
city, in hopes to defend that, for it will be to no purpose, but let him
go forth to the Chaldeans, and throw himself upon their mercy, before
things come to extremity, and then he shall live; they will not put him
to the sword, but give him quarter (satis est prostrasse leoni - it
suffices the lion to lay his antagonist prostrate) and he shall escape
the famine and pestilence, which will be the death of multitudes within
the city. Note, Those do better for themselves who patiently submit to
the rebukes of Providence than those who contend with them. And, if we
cannot have our liberty, we must reckon it a mercy to have our lives,
and not foolishly throw them away upon a point of honour; they m ay be
reserved for better times. 2. The princes persist in their malice
against Jeremiah. He was faithful to his country and to his trust as a
prophet, though he had suffered many a time for his faithfulness; and,
though at this time he ate the king's bread, yet that did not stop his
mouth. But his persecutors were still bitter against him, and complained
that he abused the liberty he had of walking in the court of the prison;
for, though he could not go to the temple to preach, yet he vented the
same things in private conversation to those that came to visit him, and
therefore ([Jer 38:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#004).md) they represented
him to the king as a dangerous man, disaffected to his country and to
the government he lived under: He seeks not the welfare of this people,
but the hurt - an unjust insinuation, for no man had laid out himself
more for the good of Jerusalem than he had done. They represent his
preaching as having a bad tendency. The design of it was plainly to
bring men to repent and turn to God, which would have been as much as
any thing a strengthening to the hands both the soldiery and of the
burghers, and yet they represented it as weakening their hands and
discouraging them; and, if it did this, it was their own fault. Note, It
is common for wicked people to look upon God's faithful ministers as
their enemies, only because they show them what enemies they are to
themselves while they continue impenitent. 3. Jeremiah hereupon, by the
king's permission, is put into a dungeon, with a view to his destruction
there. Zedekiah, though he felt a conviction that Jeremiah was a
prophet, sent of God, had not courage to own it, but yielded to the
violence of his persecutors ([Jer
38:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#005).md): He is in your hand; and a worse
sentence he could not have passed upon him. We found in Jehoiakim's
reign that the princes were better affected to the prophet than the king
was ([Jer 36:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#025).md); but now they were
more violent against him, a sign that they were ripening apace for ruin.
Had it been in a cause that concerned his own honour or profit, he would
have let them know that the king is he who can do what he pleases,
whether they will or no; but in the cause of God and his prophet, which
he was very cool in, he basely sneaks, and truckles to them: The king is
not he that can do any thing against you. Note, Those will have a great
deal to answer for who, though they have a secret kindness for good
people, dare not own it in a time of need, nor will do what they might
do to prevent mischief designed them. The princes, having this general
warrant from the king, immediately put poor Jeremiah into the dungeon of
Malchiah, that was in the court of the prison ([Jer
38:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#006).md), a deep dungeon, for they let
him down into it with cords, and a dirty one, for there was no water in
it, but mire; and he sunk in the mire, up to the neck, says Josephus.
Those that put him here doubtless designed that he should die here, die
for hunger, die for cold, and so die miserably, die obscurely, fearing,
if they should put him to death openly, the people might be affected
with what he would say and be incensed against them. Many of God's
faithful witnesses have thus been privately made away, and starved to
death, in prisons, whose blood will be brought to account in the day of
discovery. We are not here told what Jeremiah did in this distress, but
he tells us himself ([Lam 3:55](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#055.md), [Lam
3:57](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#057).md), I called upon thy name, O Lord!
out of the low dungeon, and thou drewest near, saying, Fear not. 4.
Application is made to the king by an honest courtier, Ebed-melech, one
of the gentlemen of the bed-chamber, in behalf of the poor sufferer.
Though the princes carried on the matter as privately as they could, yet
it came to the ear of this good man, who probably sought opportunities
to do good. It may be he came to the knowledge of it by hearing
Jeremiah's moans out of the dungeon, for it was in the king's house,
[Jer 38:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#007.md). Ebed-melech was an
Ethiopian, a stranger to the commonwealth of Israel, and yet had in him
more humanity, and more divinity too, than native Israelites had. Christ
found more faith among Gentiles than among Jews. Ebed-melech lived in a
wicked court and in a very corrupt degenerate age, and yet had a great
sense both of equity and piety. God has his remnant in all places, among
all sorts. There were saints even in Caesar's household. The king was
now sitting in the gate of Benjamin, to try causes and receive appeals
and petitions, or perhaps holding a council of war there. Thither
Ebed-melech went immediately to him, for the case would not admit delay;
the prophet might have perished if he had trifled or put it off till he
had an opportunity of speaking to the king in private. Not time must be
lost when life is in danger, especially so valuable a life. He boldly
asserts the Jeremiah had a great deal of wrong done him, and is not
afraid to tell the king so, though they were princes that did it, though
they were now present in court, and though they had the king's warrant
for what they did. Whither should oppressed innocency flee for
protection but to the throne, especially when great men are its
oppressors? Ebed-melech appears truly brave in this matter. He does not
mince the matter; though he had a place at court, which he would be in
danger of losing for his plain dealing, yet he tells the king
faithfully, let him take it as he will, These men have done ill in all
that they have done to Jeremiah. They had dealt unjustly with him, for
he had not deserved any punishment at all; and they had dealt
barbarously with him, so as they used not to deal with the vilest
malefactors. And they needed not to have put him to this miserable
death; for, if they had let him alone where he was, he was likely to die
for hunger in the place where he was, in the court of the prison to
which he was confined, for there was not more bread in the city: the
stores out of which he was to have his allowance ([Jer
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#021).md) were in a manner spent. See how
God can raise up friends for his people in distress where they little
thought of them, and animate men for his service even beyond
expectation. 5. Orders are immediately given for his release, and
Ebed-melech takes care to see them executed. The king, who but now durst
do nothing against the princes, had his heart wonderfully changed on a
sudden, and will now have Jeremiah released in defiance of the princes,
for therefore he orders no less than thirty men, and those of the
lifeguard, to be employed in fetching him out of the dungeon, lest the
princes should raise a party to oppose it, [Jer
38:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#010.md). Let this encourage us to appear
boldly for God - we may succeed better that we could have thought, for
the hearts of kings are in the hand of God. Ebed-melech gained his
point, and soon brought Jeremiah the good news; and it is observable how
particularly the manner of his drawing him out of the dungeon is related
(for God is not unrighteous to forget any work or labour of love which
is shown to his people or ministers, no, nor any circumstance of it,
[Heb 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#010).md); special notice is taken of
his great tenderness in providing old soft rags for Jeremiah to put
under his arm-holes, to keep the cords wherewith he was to be drawn up
from hurting him, his arm-holes being probably galled by the cords
wherewith he was let down. Nor did he throw the rags down to him, lest
they should be lost in the mire, but carefully let them down, [Jer
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#011.md), [Jer
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#012.md). Note, Those that are in
distress should not only be relieved, but relieved with compassion and
marks of respect, all which shall be placed to account and abound to a
good account in the day of recompence. See what a good use even old
rotten rags may be put to, which therefore should not be made waste of,
any more than broken meat: even in the king's house, and under the
treasury too, these were carefully preserved for the use of the poor or
sick. Jeremiah is brought up out of the dungeon, and is now where he
was, in the court of the prison, [Jer
38:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#013.md). Perhaps Ebed-melech could have
made interest with the king to get him his discharge thence also, now
that he had the king's ear; but he though him safer and better provided
for there than he would be any where else. God can, when he pleases,
make a prison to become a refuge and hiding-place to his people in
distress and danger.

[Jeremiah 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 38:14</span></span>

In the foregoing chapter we had the king in close conference with
Jeremiah, and here again, though ([Jer
38:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#005).md) he had given him up into the
hands of his enemies; such a struggle there was in the breast of this
unhappy prince between his convictions and his corruptions. Observe,

I. The honour that Zedekiah did to the prophet. When he was newly
fetched out of the dungeon he sent for him to advise with him privately.
He met him in the third entry, or (as the margin reads it) the principal
entry, that is in, or leads towards, or adjoins to, the house of the
Lord, [Jer 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#014.md). In appointing this
place of interview with the prophet perhaps he intended to show a
respect and reverence for the house of God, which was proper enough now
that he was desiring to hear the word of God. Zedekiah would ask
Jeremiah a thing; it should rather be rendered, a word. "I am here
asking thee for a word of prediction, of counsel, of comfort, a word
from the Lord, [Jer 37:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#017.md). Whatever
word thou has for me hide it not from me; let me know the worst." He had
been told plainly what things would come to in the foregoing chapter,
but, like Balaam, he asks again, in hopes to get a more pleasing answer,
as if God, who is in one mind, were altogether such a one as himself,
who was in many minds.

II\. The bargain that Jeremiah made with him before he would give him
his advice, [Jer 38:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#015.md). He would
stipulate, 1. For his own safety. Zedekiah would have him deal
faithfully with him: "And if I do," says Jeremiah, "wilt thou not put me
to death? I am afraid thou wilt" (so some take it); "what else can I
expect when thou art led blindfold by the princes?" Not that Jeremiah
was backward to seal the doctrine he preached with his blood, when he
was called to do so; but, in doing our duty, we ought to use all lawful
means for our own preservation; even the apostles of Christ did so. 2.
He would answer for the success of his advice, being no less concerned
for Zedekiah's welfare than for his own. He is willing to give him
wholesome advice, and does not upbraid him with his unkindness in
suffering him to be put into the dungeon, nor bid him go and consult
with his princes, whose judgments he had such a value for. Ministers
must with meekness instruct even those that oppose themselves, and
render good for evil. He is desirous that he should hear counsel and
receive instruction: "Wilt thou not hearken unto me? Surely thou wilt; I
am in hopes to find thee pliable at last, and now in this thy day
willing to know the things that belong to thy peace." Note, Then, and
then only, there is hope of sinners, when they are willing to hearken to
good counsel. Some read it as spoken despairingly: "If I give thee
counsel, thou wilt not hearken unto me; I have reason to fear thou wilt
not, and then I might as well keep my counsel to myself." Note,
Ministers have little heart to speak to those who have long and often
turned a deaf ear to them. Now, as to this latter concern of Jeremiah's,
Zedekiah makes him no answer, will not promise to hearken to his advice:
though he desires to know what is the mind of God, yet he will reserve
himself a liberty, when he does know it, to do as he things fit; as if
it were the prerogative of a prince not to have his ruin prevented by
good counsel. But, as to the prophet's safety, he promises him, upon the
word of a king, and confirms his promise with an oath, that, whatever he
should say to him, no advantage should be taken against him for it: I
will neither put thee to death nor deliver thee into the hands of those
that will, [Jer 38:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#016.md). This, he
thought, was a mighty favour, and yet Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar,
when Daniel read their doom, not only protected him, but preferred and
rewarded him, [Dan 2:48](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#048.md); [Dan
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#029.md). Zedekiah's oath on this occasion
is solemn, and very observable: "As the Lord liveth, who made us this
soul, who gave me my life and thee thine, I dare not take away thy life
unjustly, knowing that then I should forfeit my own to him that is the
Lord of life." Note, God is the Father of spirits; souls are his
workmanship, and they are more fearfully and wonderfully made than
bodies are. The soul both of the greatest prince and of the poorest
prisoner is of God's making. He fashioneth their hearts alike easily. In
all our appeals to God, and in all our dealings both with ourselves and
others, we ought to consider this, that the living God made us these
souls.

III\. The good advice that Jeremiah gave him, with good reasons why he
should take it, not from any prudence or politics of his own, but in the
name of the Lord, the God of hosts and God of Israel. Not as a
statesman, but as a prophet, he advises him by all means to surrender
himself and his city to the king of Babylon's princes: "Go forth to
them, and make the best terms thou canst with them," [Jer
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#017.md). This was the advice he had
given to the people ([Jer 38:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#002.md), and
before, [Jer 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#009).md), to submit to
divine judgments, and not think of contending with them. Note, In
dealing with God, that which is good counsel to the meanest is so to the
greatest, for there is no respect of persons with him. To persuade him
to take this counsel, he sets before him good and evil, life and death.
1. If he will tamely yield, he shall save his children from the sword
and Jerusalem from the flames. The white flag is yet hung out; if he
will be acknowledge God's justice, he shall experience his mercy: The
city shall not be burnt, and thou shalt live and thy house. But, 2. If
he will obstinately stand it out, it will be the ruin both of his house
and Jerusalem ([Jer 38:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#018).md); for when
God judges he will overcome. This is the case of sinners with God; let
them humbly submit to his grace and government and they shall live; let
them take hold on his strength, that they may make peace, and they shall
make peace; but, if they harden their hearts against his proposals, it
will certainly be to their destruction: they must either bend or break.

IV\. The objection which Zedekiah made against the prophet's advice,
[Jer 38:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#019.md). Jeremiah spoke to him by
prophecy, in the name of God, and therefore if he had had a due regard
to the divine authority, wisdom, and goodness, as soon as he understood
what the mind of God was he would immediately have acquiesced in it and
resolved to observe it, without disputing; but, as if it had been the
dictate only of Jeremiah's prudence, he advances against it some
prudential considerations of his own: but human wisdom is folly when it
contradicts the divine counsel. All he suggests is, "I am afraid, not of
the Chaldeans; their princes are men of honour, but of the Jews, that
have already gone over to the Chaldeans; when they see me follow them,
and who had so much opposed their going, they will laugh at me, and say,
Hast thou also become weak as water?" [Isa
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#010.md). Now, 1. It was not at all
likely that he should be thus exposed and ridiculed, that the Chaldeans
should so far gratify the Jews, or trample upon him, as to deliver him
into their hands; nor that the Jews, who were themselves captives,
should be in such a gay humour as to make a jest of the misery of their
prince. Note, We often frighten ourselves from our duty by foolish,
causeless, groundless, fears, that are merely the creatures of our own
fancy and imagination. 2. If he should be taunted at a little by the
Jews, could he not despise it and make light of it? What harm would it
do him? Note, Those have very weak and fretful spirits indeed that
cannot bear to be laughed at for that which is both their duty and their
interest. 3. Though it had been really the greatest personal mischief
that he could imagine it to be, yet he ought to have ventured it, in
obedience to God, and for the preservation of his family and city. He
thought it would be looked upon as a piece of cowardice to surrender;
whereas it would be really an instance of true courage cheerfully to
bear a less evil, the mocking of the Jews, for the avoiding of a
greater, the ruin of his family and kingdom.

V. The pressing importunity with which Jeremiah followed the advice he
had given the king. He assures him that, if he would comply with the
will of God herein, the thing he feared should not come upon him ([Jer
38:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#020).md): They shall not deliver thee
up, but treat thee as becomes thy character. He begs of him, after all
the foolish games he had played, to manage wisely the last stake, and
now at length to do well for himself: Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of
the Lord, because it is his voice, so it shall be well unto thee. But he
tells him what would be the consequence if he would not obey. 1. He
himself would fall into the hands of the Chaldeans, as implacable
enemies, whom he might now make his friends by throwing himself into
their hands. if he must fall, he should contrive how to fall easily:
"Thou shalt not escape, as thou hopest to do," [Jer
38:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#023.md). 2. He would himself be
chargeable with the destruction of Jerusalem, which he pretended a
concern for the preservation of: "Thou shalt cause this city to be burnt
with fire, for by a little submission and self-denial thou mightest have
prevented it." Thus subjects often suffer for the pride and wilfulness
of their rulers, who should be their protectors, but prove their
destroyers. 3. Whereas he causelessly feared an unjust reproach for
surrendering, he should certainly fall under a just reproach for
standing it out, and that from women too, [Jer
38:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#022.md). The court ladies who were left
when Jehoiakim and Jeconiah were carried away will now at length fall
into the hands of the enemy, and they shall say, "The men of thy peace,
whom thou didst consult with and confide in, and who promised thee peace
if thou wouldst be ruled by them, have set thee on, have encouraged thee
to be bold and brace and hold out to the last extremity; and see what
comes of it? They, by prevailing upon thee, have prevailed against thee,
and thou findest those thy real enemies that would be thought thy only
friends. Now thy feet are sunk in the mire, thou art embarrassed, and
hast noway to help thyself; thy feet cannot get forward, but are turned
away back." Thus will Zedekiah be bantered by the women, when all his
wives and children shall be made a prey to the conquerors, [Jer
38:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#023.md). Note, What we seek to avoid by
sin will be justly brought upon us by the righteousness of God. And
those that decline the way of duty for fear of reproach will certainly
meet with much greater reproach in the way of disobedience. The fear of
the wicked, it shall come upon him, [Pro
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#024.md).

VI\. The care which Zedekiah took to keep this conference private ([Jer
38:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#024).md): Let no man know of these
words. he does not at all incline to take God's counsel, nor so much as
promise to consider of it; for so obstinate has he been to the calls of
God, and so wilful in the ways of sin, that though he has good counsel
given him he seems to be given up to walk in his own counsels. He has
nothing to object against Jeremiah's advice, and yet he will not follow
it. Many hear God's words, but will not do them. 1. Jeremiah is charged
to let no man know of what had passed between the king and him. Zedekiah
is concerned to keep it private, not so much for Jeremiah's safety (for
he knew the princes could do him no hurt without his permission), but
for his own reputation. Note, Many have really a better affection to
good men and good things than they are willing to own. God's prophets
are manifest in their consciences ([Co2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#011).md), but they care not for
manifesting that to the world; they would rather do them a kindness than
have it known that they do: such, it is to be feared, love the praise of
men more than the praise of God. 2. He is instructed what to say to the
princes if they should examine him about it. He must tell them that he
was petitioning the king not to remand him back to the house of Jonathan
the scribe ([Jer 38:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#025.md), [Jer
38:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#026).md), and he did tell them so ([Jer
38:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#027).md), and no doubt it was true: he
would not let slip so fair an opportunity of engaging the king's favour;
so that this was no lie or equivocation, but a part of the truth, which
it was lawful for him to put them off with when he was under no
obligation at all to tell them the whole truth. Note, Though we must be
harmless as doves, so as never to tell a wilful lie, yet we must be wise
as serpents, so as not needlessly to expose ourselves to danger by
telling all we know.
