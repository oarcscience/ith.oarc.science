### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 8:0</span></span>

Things went so very well with Israel, in the chapter before, under
Samuel's administration, that, methinks, it is a pity to find him so
quickly, as we do in this chapter, old, and going off, and things
working towards a revolution. But so it is; Israel's good days seldom
continue long. We have here, I. Samuel decaying ([Sa1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#001).md). II. His sons degenerating ([Sa1
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#002.md), [Sa1
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#003).md). III. Israel discontented with
the present government and anxious to see a change. For 1. They petition
Samuel to set a king over them ([Sa1
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#004.md), [Sa1
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#005).md). 2. Samuel brings the matter to
God ([Sa1 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#006).md). 3. God directs him
what answer to give them, by way of reproof ([Sa1
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#007.md), [Sa1
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#008).md), and by way of remonstrance,
setting forth the consequences of a change of the government, and how
uneasy they would soon be under it ([Sa1
8:9-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#009).md). 4. They insist upon their
petition ([Sa1 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#019.md), [Sa1
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#020).md). 5. Samuel promises them, from
God, that they shall shortly be gratified ([Sa1
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#021.md), [Sa1
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#022).md). Thus hard is it for people to
know when they are well off.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 8:1</span></span>

Two sad things we find here, but not strange things: - 1. A good and
useful man growing old and unfit for service ([Sa1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#001).md): Samuel was old, and could not
judge Israel, as he had done. He is not reckoned to be past sixty years
of age now, perhaps not so much; but he was a man betimes, was full of
thoughts and cared when he was a child, which perhaps hastened the
infirmities of age upon him. The fruits that are the first ripe keep the
worst. He had spent his strength and spirits in the fatigue of public
business, and now, if he think to shake himself as at other times, he
finds he is mistaken: old age has cut his hair. Those that are in the
prime of their time ought to be busy in doing the work of life: for, as
they go into years, they will find themselves less disposed to it and
less able for it. 2. The children of a good man turning aside, and not
treading in his steps. Samuel had given his sons so good an education,
and they had given him such good hopes of their doing well, and gained
such a reputation in Israel, that he made them judges, assistants to him
awhile, and afterwards deputies under him at Beersheeba, which lay
remote from Ramah, [Sa1 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#002.md). Probably
the southern countries petitioned for their residence there, that they
might not be necessitated to travel far with their causes. We have
reason to think that Samuel gave them their commissions, not because
they were his sons (he had no ambition to entail the government upon his
family, any more than Gideon had), but because, for aught that yet
appeared, they were men very fit for the trust; and none so proper to
ease the aged judge, and take some of the burden off him, as (coeteris
paribus - other things being equal) his own sons, who no doubt were
respected for their good father's sake, and, having such an advantage at
setting out, might soon have been great if they had but been good. But,
alas! his sons walked not in his ways ([Sa1
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#003).md), and, when their character was
the reverse of his, their relation to so good a man, which otherwise
would have been their honour, was really their disgrace. Degeneranti
genus opprobrium - A good extraction is a reproach to him that
degenerates from it. Note, Those that have the most grace themselves
cannot give grace to their children. It has often been the grief of good
men to see their posterity, instead of treading in their steps,
trampling upon them, and, as Job speaks, marring their path. Nay, many
that have begun well, promised fair, and set out in the right path, so
that their parents and friends have had great hopes of them, yet
afterwards have turned aside to by-paths, and been the grief of those of
whom they should have been the joy. When Samuel's sons were made judges,
and settled at a distance form him, then they discovered themselves.
Thus, (1.) Many that have been well educated, and have conducted
themselves well while they were under their parents' eye, when they have
gone abroad into the world and set up for themselves have proved bad.
Let none therefore be secure either of themselves or theirs, but depend
on divine grace. (2.) Many that have done well in a state of meanness
and subjection have been spoiled by preferment and power. Honours change
men's minds, and too often for the worse. It does not appear that
Samuel's sons were so profane and vicious as Eli's sons; but, whatever
they were in other respects, they were corrupt judges, they turned aside
after lucre, after the mammon of unrighteousness, so the Chaldee reads
it. Note, The love of money is the root of all evil. It is pernicious in
any, but especially in judges. Samuel had taken no bribes ([Job
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#003).md), but his sons had, though, no
doubt, he warned them against it when he made them judges; and then they
perverted judgment. In determining controversies, they had an eye to the
bribe, not to the law, and enquired who bid highest, not who had right
on his side. It is sad with a people when the public justice that should
do them right, being perverted, does them the greatest wrong.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 8:4</span></span>

We have here the starting of a matter perfectly new and surprising,
which was the setting up of kingly government in Israel. Perhaps the
thing had been often talked of among them by those that were given to
change and affected that which looked great. But we do not find that it
was ever till now publicly proposed and debated. Abimelech was little
better than a titular king, though he is said to reign over Israel ([Jdg
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#022).md), and perhaps his fall had for a
great while rendered the title of king odious in Israel, as that of
Tarquinius did among the Romans; but, if it had, by this time the odium
was worn off, and some bold steps are here taken towards so great a
revolution as that amounted to. Here is,

I. The address of the elders to Samuel in this matter ([Sa1
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#004.md), [Sa1
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#005).md): They gathered themselves
together, by common consent; and not in a riotous tumultuous manner, but
with the respect due to his character, they came to him to his house as
Ramah with their address, which contained,

1\. A remonstrance of their grievances: in short, Thou art old, and thy
sons walk not in thy ways. Many a fairer occasion that people had had to
ask a king, when they were oppressed by their neighbours or embroiled at
home for want of a king in Israel, but a small thing will serve factious
spirits for a colour to desire a change. (1.) It was true that Samuel
was old; but if that made him less able to ride the circuit, and sit
long on the bench, yet it made him the more wise and experienced, and,
upon that account, the fitter to rule. If he was old, had he not grown
old in their service? And it was very unkind, ungrateful, nay, and
unjust, to cast him off when he was old, who had spent his days in doing
them good. God had saved his youth from being despicable ([Sa1
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#020).md), yet they make his old age so,
which should have been counted worthy of double honour. If old people be
upbraided with their infirmities, and laid aside for them, let them not
think it strange; Samuel himself was so. (2.) It was true that his sons
did not walk in his ways; the more was his grief, but they could not say
it was his fault: he had not, like Eli, indulged them in their badness,
but was ready to receive complaints against them. And, if that had been
the thing desired, we may well suppose, upon the making out of the
charge of bribery against them he would have superseded their
commissions and punished them. But this would not content the elders of
Israel; they had another project in their head.

2\. A petition for the redress of these grievances, by setting a king
over them: Make us a king to judge us like all the nations. Thus far it
was well, that they did not rise up in rebellion against Samuel and set
up a king for themselves, vi et armis - by force; but they applied to
Samuel, God's prophet, and humbly begged of him to do it. But it appears
by what follows that it was an evil proposal and ill made, and was
displeasing to God. God designed them a king, a man after his own heart,
when Samuel was dead; but they would anticipate God's counsel, and would
have one now that Samuel was old. They had a prophet to judge them, that
had immediate correspondence with heaven, and therein they were great
and happy above any nation, none having God so nigh unto them as they
had, [Deu 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#007.md). But this would not
serve; they must have a king to judge them with external pomp and power,
like all the nations. A poor prophet in a mantle, though conversant in
the visions of the Almighty, looked mean in the eyes of those who judged
by outward appearance; but a king in a purple robe, with his guards and
officers of state, would look great: and such a one they must have. They
knew it was in vain to court Samuel to take upon him the title and
dignity of a king, but he must appoint them one. They do not say, "Give
us a king that is wise and good, and will judge better than thy sons
do," but, "Give us a king," any body that will but make a figure. Thus
foolishly did they forsake their own mercies, and, under pretence of
advancing the dignity of their nation to that of their neighbours, did
really thrust themselves down from their own excellency, and profane
their crown by casting it to the ground.

II\. Samuel's resentment of this address, [Sa1
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#006.md). Let us see how he took it. 1. It
cut him to the heart. Probably it was a surprise to him, and he had not
any intimation before of their design, which made it the more grievous.
The thing displeased Samuel; not when they upbraided him with his own
infirmities and his children's irregularities (he could patiently bear
what reflected on himself and his own family), but it displeased him
when they said, Give us a king to judge us, because that reflected upon
God and his honour. 2. It drove him to his knees; he gave them no answer
for the present, but took time to consider of what they proposed, and
prayed unto the Lord for direction what to do, spreading the case before
him and leaving it with him, and so making himself easy. Samuel was a
man much in prayer, and we are encouraged in every thing to make our
requests known to God, [Phi 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006.md). When
any thing disturbs us, it is our interest, as well as our duty, to show
before God our trouble, and he gives us leave to be humbly free with
him.

III\. The instruction God gave him concerning this matter. Those that in
straits seek to God shall find him nigh unto them, and ready to direct
them. He tells him,

1\. That which would be an allay to his displeasure. Samuel was much
disturbed at the proposal: it troubled him greatly to see his prophetic
office thus slighted, and all the good turns he had done to Israel thus
ungratefully returned; but God tells him he must not think it either
hard or strange. (1.) He must not think it hard that they had put this
slight upon him, for they had herein put a slight upon God himself:
"They have not rejected thee only, but they have rejected me. I share
with thee in the affront," [Sa1 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#007.md).
Note, If God interest himself in the indignities that are done us, and
the contempts that are put upon us, we may well afford to bear them
patiently; nor need we think the worse of ourselves if for his sake we
bear reproach ([Psa 69:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#007).md), but rather
rejoice and count it an honour, [Col
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024.md). Samuel must not complain that
they were weary of his government, though just and gentle, for really
they were weary of God's government; this was what they disliked: They
have rejected me, that I should not reign over them. God reigns over the
heathen ([Psa 47:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#008).md), over all the
world, but the government of Israel had hitherto been, in a more
peculiar manner than ever any government was, a Theocracy, a divine
government; their judges had their call and commission immediately from
God; the affairs of their nation were under his peculiar direction. As
the constitution, so the administration of their government, was by Thus
saith the Lord; this method they were weary of, though it was their
honour and safety, above any thing, so long as they kept in with God.
They were indeed so much the more exposed to calamities if they provoked
God to anger by sin, and found they could not transgress at so cheap a
rate as other nations could, which perhaps was the true reason why they
desired to stand upon the same terms with God that other nations did.
(2.) He must not think it strange, nor marvel at the matter, for they do
as they always have done: According to all the works which they have
done, since the day that I brought them out of Egypt, so do they unto
thee, [Sa1 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#008.md); They had at first been
so very respectful and obsequious to Samuel that he began to hope they
were cured of their old stubborn disposition; but now he found himself
deceived in them, and must not be surprised at it. They had always been
rude to their governors, witness Moses and Aaron; nay, They have
forsaken me and served other gods; the greatness of their crime, in
affecting new gods, may make this crime of affecting new governors seem
little. Samuel might expect they would deal treacherously, for they were
called transgressors from the womb, [Isa
48:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#008.md). This had been their manner from
their youth up, [Jer 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#021.md).

2\. He tells him that which would be an answer to their demand. Samuel
would not have known what to say if God had not instructed him. Should
he oppose the motion, it would bespeak a greater fondness of power and
dominion than did become a prophet, and an indulgence of his sons.
Should he yield to the motion, it would look like the betraying of his
trust, and he would become accessory to all the bad consequences of a
change. Aaron sinned in gratifying the people when they said, Make us
gods; Samuel dares not therefore comply with them when they say, Make us
a king, but he gives them, with assurance, the answer God sent them.

(1.) He must tell them that they shall have a king. Hearken to the voice
of the people, [Sa1 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#007.md), and again,
[Sa1 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#009.md). Not that God was pleased
with their request, but, as sometimes he crosses us in love, so at other
times he gratifies us in wrath; he did so here. When they said, Give us
a king and princes he gave them a king in his anger (see [Hos
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#010.md), [Hos
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#011).md), as he gave them quails, [Psa
106:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#015.md); [Psa
78:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#029.md). God bade Samuel humour them in
this matter, \[1.\] That they might be beaten with their own rod, and
might feel, to their cost, the difference between his government and the
government of a king; see [Ch2 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#008.md).
It soon appeared how much worse their condition was, in all respects,
under Saul, than it had been under Samuel. \[2.\] To prevent something
worse. If they were not gratified, they would either rise in rebellion
against Samuel or universally revolt from their religion and admit the
gods of the nations, that they might have kings like them. Rather than
so, let them have a king. \[3.\] God knows how to bring glory to himself
out of it, and to serve his own wise purposes even by their foolish
counsels.

(2.) But he must tell them, withal, that when they have a king they will
soon have enough of him, and will, when it is too late, repent of their
choice. This he must protest solemnly to them ([Sa1
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#009).md), that, if they would have a king
to rule them, as the eastern kings ruled their subjects, they would find
the yoke exceedingly heavy. They looked only at the pomp or magnificence
of a king, and thought that would make their nation great and
considerable among its neighbours, and would strike a terror upon their
enemies; but he must bid them consider how they would like to bear the
charges of that pomp, and how they would endure that arbitrary power
which the neighbouring kings assumed. Note, Those that set their hearts
inordinately upon any thing in this world ought, for the moderating of
their desires, to consider the inconveniences as well as the
conveniences that will attend it, and to set the one over against the
other in their thoughts. Those that submit to the government of the
world and the flesh are told plainly what hard masters they are, and
what a tyranny the dominion of sin is; and yet they will exchange God's
government for it.

IV\. Samuel's faithful delivery of God's mind to them, [Sa1
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#010.md). He told them all the words of
the Lord, how ill he resented it, that he construed it a rejecting of
him, and compared it with their serving other gods, - that he would
grant their request if they insisted on it, but withal had ordered him
to represent to them the certain consequences of their choice, that they
would be such that if they had any reason left them, and would allow
themselves to consult their own interest, they would withdraw their
petition, and beg to continue as they were. Accordingly he lays before
them, very particularly, what would be, not the right of a king in
general, but the manner of the king that should reign over them,
according to the pattern of the nations, [Sa1
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#011.md). Samuel does not speak (as bishop
Patrick expounds it) of a just and honest right of a king to do these
things, for his right is quite otherwise described in that part of
Moses's law which concerns the king's duty, but such a right as the
kings of the nations had then acquired. This shall be the manner of the
king, that is, "thus he must support his dignity at the expense of that
which is dearest to you, and thus he will abuse his power, as those that
have power are apt to do; and, having the militia in his hand, you will
be under a necessity of submitting to him."

1\. If they will have such a king as the nations have, let them
consider, (1.) That king must have a great retinue, abundance of
servants to wait on him, grooms to look after his chariots and horses,
gentlemen to ride about with him, and footmen to run before his
chariots. This is the chief grandeur of princes, and the imaginary glory
of great men, to have a multitude of attendants. And whence must he have
these? "Why, he will take your sons, who are free-born, have a liberal
education, and whom you now have at your own disposal, and will appoint
them for himself," [Sa1 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#011.md). They
must wait upon him, and be at his beck; those that used to work for
their parents and themselves must work for him, ear his ground, and reap
his harvest ([Sa1 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#012).md), and count it
their preferment too, [Sa1 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#016.md). This
would be a great change. (2.) He must keep a great table; he will not be
content to dine with his neighbours upon a sacrifice, as Samuel used to
do ([Sa1 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#013).md); but he must have a
variety of dainty dishes, forced meats, and sweet-meats, and delicate
sauces; and who must prepare him these? "Why, he will take your
daughters, the most ingenious and handy of them, whom you hoped to
prefer to houses and tables of their own; and, whether you be willing or
no, they must be his confectioners, and cooks, and bakers, and the
like." (3.) "He must needs have a standing army, for guards and
garrisons; and your sons, instead of being elders of your cities, and
living in quiet and honour at home, must be captains over thousands and
captains over fifties, and must be disposed of at the pleasure of the
sovereign." (4.) "You may expect that he will have great favourites,
whom, having dignified and ennobled, he must enrich, and give them
estates suitable to their honour; and which way can he do that, but out
of your inheritances? [Sa1 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#014.md). He
will take your fields and vineyards, which descended to you from your
ancestors, and which you hoped to leave to your posterity after you,
even the best of them; and will not only take them to himself (you could
bear that better), but he will give them to his servants, who will be
your masters, and bear rule over that for which you have laboured, How
will you like that?" (5.) "He must have great revenues to maintain his
grandeur and power with; and whence must he have them but from you? He
will take the tenth of the fruits of your ground ([Sa1
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#015).md), and your cattle, [Sa1
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#017.md). You think the tenths, the double
tenths, which the law of God has appointed for the support of the
church, grievous enough, and grudge the payment of them; but, if you
have a king, there must issue another tenth out of your estates, which
will be levied with more rigour, for the support of the royal dignity.
Consider the expense with the magnificence, and whether it will quit
cost."

2\. These would be their grievances, and, (1.) They would have none but
God to complain to. Once they complained to the prince himself, and were
answered, according to the manner of the king, Your yoke is heavy, and I
will add to it, [Kg1 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#011). (2..md) When
they complained to God he would not hear them, [Sa1
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#018.md). Nor could they expect that he
should, both because they had been deaf to his calls and admonitions,
and this trouble, in particular, they had brought upon themselves by
rejecting him, and would not believe when he told them what would come
of it. Note, When we bring ourselves into distress by our own irregular
desires and projects we justly forfeit the comfort of prayer and the
benefit of divine aids, and, if God be not better to us than we deserve,
must have our relief in our own hands, and then it is bad with us.

V. The people's obstinacy in their demand, [Sa1
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#019.md), [Sa1
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#020.md). One would think such a
representation of the consequences as this was, coming from God himself,
who can neither deceive by his word nor be deceived in his knowledge,
should have prevailed with them to waive their request: but their hearts
were upon it, right or wrong, good or evil: "We will have a king over
us, whatever God or Samuel say to the contrary; we will have a king,
whatever it cost us, and whatever inconvenience we bring upon ourselves
or our posterity by it." See their folly. 1. They were quite deaf to
reason and blind to their own interest. They could not answer Samuel's
arguments against it, nor deny the force of them, and yet they grow more
violent in their request, and more insolent. Before it was, "Pray, make
us a king;" now it is, "Nay, but we will have a king; yea, that we will,
because we will; nor will we bear to have any thing said against it."
See the absurdity of inordinate desires, and how they rob men of their
reason. 2. They could not stay God's time. God had intimated to them in
the law that, in due time, Israel should have a king ([Deu
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#014.md), [Deu
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#015).md), and perhaps they had some
intimation that the time was at hand; but they are all in haste: "We, in
our day, will have this king over us." Could they but have waited ten or
twelve years longer they would have had David, a king of God's giving in
mercy, and all the calamities that attended the setting up of Saul would
have been prevented. Sudden resolves and hasty desires make work for a
long and leisurely repentance. 3. That which they aimed at in desiring a
king was not only, as before, that they might be like the nations, and
levelled with the one above whom God had so far advanced them, but that
they might have one to judge them, and to go out before them when they
took the field, and to fight their battles. Foolish people and unwise!
Could they ever desire a battle better fought for them that the last
was, by Samuel's prayer and God's thunder? [Sa1
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#010.md). Was victory hereby too sure to
them? And were they fond of trying the chance of war at the same
uncertainty that others did? So sick, it seems, were they of their
privileges: and what was the issue? Their first king was slain in a
battle, which none of their judges ever were; so was Josiah, one of the
last and best.

VI\. The dismissing of them with an intimation that very shortly they
should have what they asked. 1. Samuel rehearsed all their words in the
ears of the Lord, v. 21. Not but that God perfectly knew it, without
Samuel's report; but thus he dealt faithfully between God and Israel, as
a prophet, returning the answer to him that sent him; and thus he waited
on God for further direction. God is fully acquainted with the state of
the case we are in care and doubt about, but he will know it from us.
His rehearsing it in the ears of the Lord intimates that it was done in
private; for the people were not disposed to join with him in prayer to
God for direction in this matter; also it bespeaks a holy familiarity,
to which God graciously admits his people: they speak in the ears of the
Lord, as one friend whispers with another; their communion with God is
meat they have to eat which the world knows not of, [Joh
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#032.md). 2. God gave direction that they
should have a king, since they were so inordinately set upon it ([Sa1
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#022).md): "Make them a king, and let them
make their best of him, and thank themselves if that very pomp and power
which they are so eager to see their sovereign in be their plague and
burden." So he gave them up to their own hearts' lusts. Samuel told them
this, but sent them home for the present, every man to his city; for the
designation of the person must be left to God; they had now no more to
