### [Ezekiel Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 31:0</span></span>

The prophecy of this chapter, as the two chapters before, is against
Egypt, and designed for the humbling and mortifying of Pharaoh. In
passing sentence upon great criminals it is usual to consult precedents,
and to see what has been done to others in the like case, which serves
both to direct and to justify the proceedings. Pharaoh stands indicted
at the bar of divine justice for his pride and haughtiness, and the
injuries he had done to God's people; but he thinks himself so high, so
great, as not to be accountable to any authority, so strong, and so well
guarded, as not to be conquerable by any force. The prophet is therefore
directed to make a report to him of the case of the king of Assyria,
whose head city was Nineveh. I. He must show him how great a monarch the
king of Assyria had been, what a vast empire he had, what a mighty sway
he bore; the king of Egypt, great as he was could not go beyond him
([Eze 31:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#003).md). II. He must then show
him how like he was to the king of Assyria in pride and carnal security
([Eze 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#010).md). III. He must next read
him the history of the fall and ruin of the king of Assyria, what a
noise it made among the nations and what a warning it gave to all potent
princes to take heed of pride ([Eze
31:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#011).md). IV. He must leave the king
of Egypt to apply all this to himself, to see his own face in the
looking-glass of the king of Assyria's sin, and to foresee his own fall
through the perspective glass of his ruin ([Eze
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#018).md).

[Ezekiel 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 31:1</span></span>

This prophecy bears date the month before Jerusalem was taken, as that
in the close of the foregoing chapter about four months before. When
God's people were in the depth of their distress, it would be some
comfort to them, as it would serve likewise for a check to the pride and
malice of their neighbours, that insulted over them, to be told from
heaven that the cup was going round, even the cup of trembling, that it
would shortly be taken out of the hands of God's people and put into the
hands of those that hated them, [Isa
51:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#022.md), [Isa
51:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#023.md). In this prophecy,

I. The prophet is directed to put Pharaoh upon searching the records for
a case parallel to his own ([Eze
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#002).md): Speak to Pharaoh and to his
multitude, to the multitude of his attendants, that contributed so much
to his magnificence, and the multitude of his armies, that contributed
so much to his strength. These he was proud of, these he put a
confidence in; and they were as proud of him and trusted as much in him.
Now ask him, Whom art thou like in thy greatness? We are apt to judge of
ourselves by comparison. Those that think highly of themselves fancy
themselves as great and as good as such and such, that have been
mightily celebrated. The flatterers of princes tell them whom they equal
in pomp and grandeur. "Well," says God, "let him pitch upon the most
famous potentate that ever was, and it shall be allowed that he is like
him in greatness and no way inferior to him; but, let him pitch upon
whom he will, he will find that his day came to fall; he will see there
was an end of all his perfection, and must therefore expect the end of
his own in like manner." Note, The falls of others, both into sin and
ruin, are intended as admonitions to us not to be secure or high-minded,
nor to think we stand out of danger.

II\. He is directed to show him an instance of one whom he resembles in
greatness, and that was the Assyrian ([Eze
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#003).md), whose monarchy had continued
from Nimrod. Sennacherib was one of the mighty princes of that monarchy;
but it sunk down soon after him, and the monarchy of Nebuchadnezzar was
built upon its ruins, or rather grafted upon its stock. Let us now see
what a flourishing prince the king of Assyria was. He is here compared
to a stately cedar, [Eze 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#003.md). The
glory of the house of David is illustrated by the same similitude, [Eze
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#003.md). The olive-tree, the fig-tree,
and the vine, which were all fruit-trees, had refused to be promoted
over the trees because they would not leave their fruitfulness ([Jdg
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#008), etc..md), and therefore the choice
falls upon the cedar, that is stately and strong, and casts a great
shadow, but bears no fruit. 1. The Assyrian monarch was a tall cedar,
such as the cedars in Lebanon generally were, of a high stature, and his
top among the thick boughs; he was attended by other princes that were
tributaries to him, and was surrounded by a life-guard of brave men. He
surpassed all the princes in his neighbourhood; they were all shrubs to
him ([Eze 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#005).md): His height was
exalted above all the trees of the field; they were many of them very
high, but he overtopped them all, [Eze
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#008.md). The cedars, even those in the
garden of Eden, which we may suppose were the best of the kind, would
not hide him, but his top branches outshot theirs. 2. He was a spreading
cedar; his branches did not only run up in height, but run out in
breadth, denoting that this mighty prince was not only exalted to great
dignity and honour, and had a name above the names of the great men of
the earth, but that he obtained great dominion and power; his
territories were large, and he extended his conquests far and his
influences much further. This cedar, like a vine, sent forth his
branches to the sea, to the river, [Psa
80:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#011.md). His boughs were multiplied; his
branches became long ([Eze 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#005).md); so
that he had a shadowing shroud, [Eze
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#003.md). This contributed very much to
his beauty, that he grew proportionably large as well as high. He was
fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches ([Eze
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#007).md), very comely as well as very
stately, fair by the multitude of his branches, [Eze
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#009.md). His large dominions were well
managed, like a spreading tree that is kept in shape and good order by
the skill of the gardener, so as to be very beautiful to the eye. His
government was as amiable in the eyes of wise men as it was admirable in
the eyes of all men. The fir-trees were not like his boughs, so
straight, so green, so regular; nor were the branches of the
chestnut-trees like his branches, so thick, so spreading. In short, no
tree in the garden of God, in Eden, in Babylon (for that stood where
paradise was planted), where there was every tree that was pleasant to
the sight ([Gen 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#009).md), was like to this
cedar in beauty; that is, in all the surrounding nations there was no
prince so much admired, so much courted, and whom every body was so much
in love with, as the king of Assyria. Many of them did virtuously, but
he excelled them all, outshone them all. All the trees of Eden envied
him, [Eze 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#009.md). When they found they
could not compare with him they were angry and grieved that he so far
outdid them, and secretly grudged him the praise due to him. Note, It is
the unhappiness of those who in any thing excel others that thereby they
make themselves the objects of envy; and who can stand before envy? 3.
He was serviceable, as far as a standing growing cedar could be, and
that was only by his shadow ([Eze
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#006).md): All the fowls of heaven, some
of all sorts, made their nests in his boughs, where they were sheltered
from the injuries of the weather. The beasts of the field put themselves
under the protection of his branches. There they were levant - rising
up, and couchant - lying down; there they brought forth their young; for
they had there a natural covert from the heat and from the storm. The
meaning of all is, Under his shadow dwelt all great nations; they all
fled to him for safety, and were willing to swear allegiance to him if
he would undertake to protect them, as travellers in a shower come under
thick trees for shelter. Note, Those who have power ought to use it for
the protection and comfort of those whom they have power over; for to
that end they are entrusted with power. Even the bramble, if he be
anointed king, invites the trees to come and trust in his shadow, [Jdg
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#015.md). But the utmost security that any
creature, even the king of Assyria himself, can give, is but like the
shadow of a tree, which is but a scanty and slender protection, and
leaves a man many ways exposed. Let us therefore flee to God for
protection, and he will take us under the shadow of his wings, where we
shall be warmer and safer than under the shadow of the strongest and
stateliest cedar, [Psa 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008.md); [Psa
91:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#004.md). 4. He seemed to be settled and
established in his greatness and power. For, (1.) It was God that made
him fair, [Eze 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#009.md). For by him kings
reign. He was comely with the comeliness that God put upon him. Note,
God's hand must be eyed and owned in the advancement of the great men of
the earth, and therefore we must not envy them; yet that will not secure
the continuance of their prosperity, for he that gave them their beauty,
if they be deprived of it, knows how to turn it into deformity. (2.) He
seemed to have a good bottom. This cedar was not like the heath in the
desert, made to inhabit the parched places ([Jer
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#006).md); it was not a root in a dry
ground, [Isa 53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002.md). No; he had
abundance of wealth to support his power and grandeur ([Eze
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#004).md): The waters made him great; he
had vast treasures, large stores and magazines, which were as the deep
that set him up on high, constant revenues coming in by taxes, customs,
and crown-rents, which were as rivers running round about his plants;
these enabled him to strengthen and secure his interests every where,
for he sent out his little rivers, or conduits, to all the trees of the
field, to water them; and when they had maintenance from the king's
palace ([Ezr 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#014).md), and their country
was nourished by the king's country ([Act
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#020).md), they would be serviceable and
faithful to him. Those that have wealth flowing upon them in great
rivers find themselves obliged to send it out again in little rivers;
for, as goods are increased, those are increased that eat them, and the
more men have the more occasion they have for it; yea, and still the
more they have occasion for. The branches of this cedar became long,
because of the multitude of waters which fed them ([Eze
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#005.md) and [Eze
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#007).md); his root was by great waters,
which seemed to secure it that its leaf should never wither ([Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003).md), that it should not see when heat
came, [Jer 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#008.md). Note, Worldly people
may seem to have an established prosperity, yet it only seems so, [Job
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#003.md); [Psa
37:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035.md).

[Ezekiel 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 31:10</span></span>

We have seen the king of Egypt resembling the king of Assyria in pomp,
and power, and prosperity, how like he was to him in his greatness; now
here we see,

I. How he does likewise resemble him in his pride, [Eze
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#010.md). For, as face answers to face in
a glass, so does one corrupt carnal heart to another; and the same
temptations of a prosperous state by which some are overcome are fatal
to many others too. "Thou, O king of Egypt! hast lifted up thyself in
height, hast been proud of thy wealth and power, [Eze
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003.md). And just so he (that is, the
king of Assyria); when he had shot up his top among the thick boughs his
heart was immediately lifted up in his height, and he grew insolent and
imperious, set God himself at defiance, and trampled upon his people;"
witness the messages and letter which the great king, the king of
Assyria, sent to Hezekiah, [Isa 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#004.md).
How haughtily does he speak of himself and his own achievements! how
scornfully of that great and good man! There were other sins in which
the Egyptians and the Assyrians did concur, particularly that of
oppressing God's people, which is charged upon them both together ([Isa
52:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#004).md); but here that sin is traced up
to its cause, and that was pride; for it is the contempt of the proud
that they are filled with. Note, When men's outward condition rises
their minds commonly rise with it; and it is very rare to find a humble
spirit in the midst of great advancements.

II\. How he shall therefore resemble him in his fall; and for the
opening of this part of the comparison,

1\. Here is a history of the fall of the king of Assyria. For his part,
says God ([Eze 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#011).md), I have
therefore, because he was thus lifted up, delivered him into the hand of
the mighty one of the heathen. Cyaxares, king of the Medes, in the
twenty-sixth year of his reign, in conjunction with Nebuchadnezzar king
of Babylon in the first year of his reign, destroyed Nineveh, and with
it the Assyrian empire. Nebuchadnezzar, though he was not then, yet
afterwards became, very emphatically, the mighty one of the heathen,
most mighty among them and most mighty over them, to prevail against
them.

(1.) Respecting the fall of the Assyrian three things are affirmed: -
\[1.\] It is God himself that orders his ruin: I have delivered him into
the hand of the executioner; I have driven him out. Note, God is the
Judge, who puts down one and sets up another ([Psa
75:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#007).md); and when he pleases he can
extirpate and expel those who think themselves, and seem to others, to
have taken deepest root. And the mightiest ones of the heathens could
not gain their point against those they contended with if the Almighty
did not himself deliver them into their hands. \[2.\] It is his own sin
that procures his ruin: I have driven him out for his wickedness. None
are driven out from their honour, power, and possessions, but it is for
their wickedness. None of our comforts are ever lost but what have been
a thousand times forfeited. If the wicked are driven away, it is in
their wickedness. \[3.\] It is a mighty one of the heathen that shall be
the instrument of his ruin; for God often employs one wicked man in
punishing another. He shall surely deal with him, shall know how to
manage him, great as he is. Note, Proud imperious men will, sooner or
later, meet with their match.

(2.) In this history of the fall of the Assyrian observe, \[1.\] A
continuation of the similitude of the cedar. He grew very high, and
extended his boughs very far; but his day comes to fall. First, This
stately cedar was cropped: The terrible of the nations cut him off.
Soldiers, who being both armed and commissioned to kill, and slay, and
destroy, may well be reckoned among the terrible of the nations. They
have lopped off his branches first, have seized upon some parts of his
dominion and forced them out of his hands; so that in all mountains and
valleys of the nations about, in the high-lands and low-lands, and by
all the rivers, there were cities or countries that were broken off from
the Assyrian monarchy, that had been subject to it, but had either
revolted or were recovered from it. Its feathers were borrowed; and,
when every bird had fetched back its own, it was naked like the stump of
a tree. Secondly, It was deserted: All the people of the earth, that had
fled to him for shelter, have gone down from his shadow and have left
him. When he was disabled to give them protection they thought they no
longer owed him allegiance. Let not great men be proud of the number of
those that attend them and have a dependence upon them; it is only for
what they can get. When Providence frowns upon them their retinue is
soon dispersed and scattered from them. Thirdly, It was insulted over,
and its fall triumphed in ([Eze
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#013).md): Upon his ruin shall all the
fowls of the heaven remain, to tread upon the broken branches of this
cedar. Its fall is triumphed in by the other trees, who were angry to
see themselves overtopped so much: All the trees of Eden, that were cut
down and had fallen before him, all that drank water of the rain of
heaven, as the stump of the tree that is left in the south is said to be
wet with the dew of heaven ([Dan 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#023).md)
and to bud through the scent of water ([Job
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#009).md), shall be comforted in the
nether parts of the earth when they see this proud cedar brought as low
as themselves. Solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris - To have
companions in woe is a solace to those who suffer. But, on the contrary,
the trees of Lebanon, that are yet standing in their height and
strength, mourned for him, and the trees of the field fainted for him,
because they could not but read their own destiny in his fall. Howl,
fir-trees, if the cedar be shaken, for they cannot expect to stand long,
[Zac 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#002.md). \[2.\] An explanation of
the similitude of the cedar. By the cutting down of this cedar is
signified the slaughter of this mighty monarch and all his adherents and
supporters; they are all delivered to death, to fall by the sword, as
the cedar by the axe. He and his princes, who, he said, were altogether
kings, go down to the grace, to the nether parts of the earth, in the
midst of the children of men, as common persons of no quality or
distinction. They died like men ([Psa
82:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#007).md); they were carried away with
those that go down to the pit, and their pomp did neither protect them
nor descend after them. Again ([Eze
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#016).md), He was cast down to hell with
those that descend into the pit; he went into the state of the dead, and
was buried as others are, in obscurity and oblivion. Again ([Eze
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#017).md), They all that were his arm, on
whom he stayed, by whom he acted and exerted his power, all that dwelt
under his shadow, his subjects and allies, and all that had any
dependence on him, they all went down into ruin, down into the grace
with him, unto those that were slain with the sword, to those that were
cut off by untimely deaths before them, under the load of guilt and
shame. When great men fall a great many fall with them, as a great many
in like manner have fallen before them. \[3.\] What God designed, and
aimed at, in bringing down this mighty monarch and his monarchy. He
designed thereby, First, To give an alarm to the nations about, to put
them all to a stand, to put them all to a gaze ([Eze
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#016).md): I made the nations to shake at
the sound of his fall. They were all struck with astonishment to see so
mighty a prince brought down thus. It give a shock to all their
confidences, every one thinking his turn would be next. When he went
down to the grace ([Eze 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#015).md) I
caused a mourning, a general lamentation, as the whole kingdom goes into
mourning at the death of the king. In token of this general grief, I
covered the deep for him, put that into black, gave a stop to business,
in complaisance to this universal mourning. I restrained the floods, and
the great waters were stayed, that they might run into another channel,
that of lamentation. Lebanon particularly, the kingdom of Syria, that
was sometimes in confederacy with the Assyrian, mourned for him; as the
allies of Babylon, [Rev 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#009.md).
Secondly, To give an admonition to the nations about, and to their kings
([Eze 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#014).md): To the end that none of
all the trees by the waters, though ever so advantageously situated, may
exalt themselves for their height, may be proud and conceited of
themselves and shoot up their top among the thick boughs, looking
disdainfully upon others, nor stand upon themselves for their height,
confiding in their own politics and powers, as if they could never be
brought down. Let them all take warning by the Assyrian, for he once
held up his head as high, and thought he kept his footing as firm, as
any of them; but his pride went before his destruction, and his
confidence failed him. Note, The fall of proud presumptuous men is
intended for warning to others to keep humble. It would have been well
for Nebuchadnezzar, who was himself active in bringing down the
Assyrian, if he had taken the admonition.

2\. Here is a prophecy of the fall of the king of Egypt in like manner,
[Eze 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#018.md). He thought himself like
the Assyrian in glory and greatness, over-topping all the trees of Eden,
as the cypress does the shrubs. "But thou also shalt be brought down,
with the other trees that are pleasant to the sight, as those in Eden.
Thou shalt be brought to the grave, to the nether or lower parts of the
earth; thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, that die in
their uncleanness, die ingloriously, die under a curse and at a distance
from God; then shall those whom thou hast trampled upon triumph over
thee, saying, This is Pharaoh and all his multitude. See how mean he
looks, how low he lies; see what all his pomp and pride have come to;
here is all that is left of him." Note, Great men and great multitudes,
with the great figure and great noise they make in the world, when God
comes to contend with them, will soon become little, less than nothing,
such as Pharaoh and all his multitude.
