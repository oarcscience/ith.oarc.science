### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 16:0</span></span>

This chapter is wholly taken up with the reign of Ahaz; and we have
quite enough of it, unless it were better. He had a good father, and a
better son, and yet was himself one of the worst of the kings of Judah.
I. He was a notorious idolater ([Kg2
16:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#001).md). II. With the treasures of the
temple, as well as his own, he hired the king of Assyria to invade Syria
and Israel ([Kg2 16:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#005).md). III. He took
pattern from an idol's altar which he saw at Damascus for a new altar in
God's temple ([Kg2 16:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010).md). IV. He
abused and embezzled the furniture of the temple ([Kg2
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#017.md), [Kg2
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#018).md). And so his story ends ([Kg2
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#019.md), [Kg2
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#020).md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 16:1</span></span>

We have here a general character of the reign of Ahaz. Few and evil were
his days - few, for he died at thirty-six - evil, for we are here told,
1. That he did not that which was right like David ([Kg2
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#002).md), that is, he had none of that
concern and affection for the instituted service and worship of God for
which David was celebrated. He had no love for the temple, made no
conscience of his duty to God, nor had any regard to his law. Herein he
was unlike David; it was his honour that he was of the house and lineage
of David, and it was owing to God's ancient covenant with David that he
was now upon the throne, which aggravated his wickedness; for he was a
reproach to that honourable name and family, which therefore was really
a reproach to him (Degeneranti genus opprobrium - A good extraction is a
disgrace to him who degenerates from it), and though he enjoyed the
benefit of David's piety he did not tread in the steps of it. 2. That he
walked in the way of the kings of Israel ([Kg2
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003).md), who all worshipped the calves.
He was not joined in any affinity with them, as Jehoram and Ahaziah were
with the house of Ahab, but, ex mero motu - without any instigation,
walked in their way. The kings of Israel pleaded policy and reasons of
state for their idolatry, but Ahaz had no such pretence: in him it was
the most unreasonable impolitic thing that could be. They were his
enemies, and had proved enemies to themselves too by their idolatry; yet
he walked in their way. 3. That he made his sons to pass through the
fire, to the honour of his dunghill-deities. He burnt them, so it is
expressly said of him ([Ch2 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#003).md),
burnt some of them, and perhaps made others of them (Hezekiah himself
not excepted, though afterwards he was never the worse for it) to pass
between two fires, or to be drawn through a flame, in token of their
dedication to the idol. 4. That he did according to the abominations of
the heathen whom the Lord had cast out. it was an instance of his great
folly that he would be guided in his religion by those whom he saw
fallen into the ditch before his eyes, and follow them; and it was an
instance of his great impiety that he would conform to those usages
which God had declared to be abominable to him, and set himself to write
after the copy of those whom God had cast out, thus walking directly
contrary to God. 5. That he sacrificed in the high places, [Kg2
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#004.md). If his father had but had zeal
enough to take them away, the debauching of his sons might have been
prevented; but those that connive at sin know not what dangerous snares
they lay for those that come after them. He forsook God's house, was
weary of that place where, in his father's time, he had often been
detained before the Lord, and performed his devotions on high hills,
where he had a better prospect, and under green trees, where he had a
more pleasant shade. It was a religion little worth, which was guided by
fancy, not by faith.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 16:5</span></span>

Here is, 1. The attempt of his confederate neighbours, the kings of
Syria and Israel, upon him. They thought to make themselves masters of
Jerusalem, and to set a king of their own in it, [Isa
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#006.md). In this they fell short, but the
king of Syria recovered Elath, a considerable port upon the Red Sea,
which Amaziah had taken from the Syrians, [Kg2
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#022.md). What can those keep that have
lost their religion? Let them expect, thenceforward, to be always on the
losing hand. 2. His project to get clear of them. Having forsaken God,
he had neither courage nor strength to make head against his enemies,
nor could he, with any boldness, ask help of God; but he made his court
to the king of Assyria, and got him to come in for his relief. Those
whose hearts condemn them will go any where in a day of distress rather
than to God. Was it because there was not a God in Israel that he sent
to the Assyrian for help? Was the rock of ages removed out of its place,
that he stayed himself on this broken reed? The sin itself was its own
punishment; for, though it is true that he gained his point (the king of
Assyria hearkened to him, and, to serve his own turn, made a descent
upon Damascus, whereby he gave a powerful diversion to the king of
Syria, [Kg2 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009.md), and obliged him to
let fall his design against Ahaz, carrying the Syrians captive to Kir,
as Amos had expressly foretold, [Amo
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#005).md), yet, considering all, he made
but a bad bargain; for, to compass this, (1.) He enslaved himself ([Kg2
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007).md): I am thy servant and thy son,
that is, "I will be as dutiful and obedient to thee as to a master or
father, if thou wilt but do me this good turn." Had he thus humbled
himself to God, and implored his favour, he might have been delivered
upon easier terms; he might have saved his money, and needed only to
have parted with his sins. But, if the prodigal forsake his father's
house, he soon becomes a slave to the worst of masters, [Luk
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#015). (2..md) He impoverished himself;
for he took the silver and gold that were laid up in the treasury both
of the temple and of the kingdom, and sent it to the king of Assyria,
[Kg2 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#008.md). Both church and state must
be squeezed and exhausted, to gratify this his new patron and guardian.
I know not what authority he had thus to dispose of the public stock;
but it is common for those that have brought themselves into straits by
one sin to help themselves out by another; and those that have alienated
themselves from God will make no difficulty of alienating any of his
rights.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 16:10</span></span>

Though Ahaz had himself sacrificed in high places, on hills, and under
every green tree ([Kg2 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#004).md), yet
God's altar had hitherto continued in its place and in use, and the
king's burnt-offering and his meat-offering ([Kg2
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#015).md) had been offered upon it by the
priests that attended it; but here we have it taken away by wicked Ahaz,
and another altar, an idolatrous one, put in the room of it - a bolder
stroke than the worst of the kings had yet given to religion. We have
here,

I. The model of this new altar, taken from one at Damascus, by the king
himself, [Kg2 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010.md). The king of
Assyria having taken Damascus, thither Ahaz went, to congratulate him on
his success, to return him thanks for the kindness he had done him by
this expedition, and, as his servant and son, to receive his commands.
Had he been faithful to his God, he would not have needed to crouch thus
meanly to a foreign power. At Damascus, either while viewing the
rarities of the place, or rather while joining with them in their
devotions (for, when he was there, he thought it no harm to do as they
did), he saw an altar that pleased his fancy extremely, not such a plain
old-fashioned one as that which he had been trained up in attendance
upon at Jerusalem, but curiously carved, it is likely, and adorned with
image-work; there were many pretty things about it which he thought
significant, surprising, very charming, and calculated to excite his
devotion. Solomon had but a dull fancy, he thought, compared with the
ingenious artist that made this altar. Nothing will serve him but he
must have an altar just like this: a pattern of it must be taken
immediately; he cannot stay till he returns himself, but sends it before
him in all haste, with orders to Urijah the priest to get one made
exactly according to this model and have it ready against he came home.
The pattern God showed to Moses in the mount or to David by the Spirit
was not comparable to this pattern sent from Damascus. The hearts of
idolaters walked after their eyes, which are therefore said to go a
whoring after their idols; but the true worshippers worship the true God
by faith.

II\. The making of it by Urijah the priests, [Kg2
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#011.md). This Urijah, it is likely, was
the chief priest who at this time presided in the temple-service. To him
Ahaz sent an intimation of his mind (for we read not of any express
orders he gave him), to get an altar made by this pattern. And, without
any dispute or objection, he put it in hand immediately, being perhaps
as fond of it as the king was, at least being very willing to humour the
king and desirous to curry favour with him. Perhaps he might have this
excuse for gratifying the king herein, that, by this means, he might
keep him to the temple at Jerusalem and prevent his totally deserting it
for the high places and the groves. "Let us oblige him in this," thinks
Urijah, "and then he will bring all his sacrifices to us; for by this
craft we get our living." But, whatever pretence he had, it was a most
base wicked thing for him that was a priest, a chief priest, to make
this altar, in compliance with an idolatrous prince, for hereby, 1. He
prostituted his authority and profaned the crown of his priesthood,
making himself a servant to the lusts of men. There is not a greater
disgrace to the ministry than obsequiousness to such wicked commands as
this was. 2. He betrayed his trust. As priest, he was bound to maintain
and defend God's institutions, and to oppose and witness against all
innovations; and, for him to assist and serve the king in setting up an
altar to confront the altar which by divine appointment he was
consecrated to minister at, was such a piece of treachery and
perfidiousness as may justly render him infamous to all posterity. Had
he only connived at the doing of it, - had he been frightened into it by
menaces, - had he endeavoured to dissuade the king from it, or but
delayed the doing of it till he came home, that he might first talk with
him about it, - it would not have been so bad; but so willingly to walk
after his commandment, as if he were glad of the opportunity to oblige
him, was such an affront to the God he served as was utterly
inexcusable.

III\. The dedicating of it. Urijah, perceiving that the king's heart was
much upon it, took care to have it ready against he came down, and set
it near the brazen altar, but somewhat lower and further from the door
of the temple. The king was exceedingly pleased with it, approached it
with all possible veneration, and offered thereon his burnt-offering,
etc., [Kg2 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#012.md), [Kg2
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#013.md). His sacrifices were not offered
to the God of Israel, but to the gods of Damascus (as we find [Ch2
28:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#023).md), and, when he borrowed the
Syrians' altar, no marvel that he borrowed their gods. Naaman, the
Syrian, embraced the God of Israel when he got earth from the land of
Israel to make an altar of.

IV\. The removal of God's altar, to make room for it. Urijah was so
modest that he put this altar at the lower end of the court, and left
God's altar in its place, between this and the house of the Lord, [Kg2
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#014.md). But that would not satisfy
Ahaz; he removed God's altar to an obscure corner in the north side of
the court, and put his own before the sanctuary, in the place of it. He
thinks his new altar is much more stately, and much more sightly, and
disgraces that; and therefore "let that be laid aside as a vessel in
which there is no pleasure." His superstitious invention, at first,
jostled with God's sacred institution, but at length jostled it out.
Note, Those will soon come to make nothing of God that will not be
content to make him their all. Ahaz durst not (perhaps for fear of the
people) quite demolish the brazen altar and knock it to pieces; but,
while he ordered all the sacrifices to be offered upon this new altar
([Kg2 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#015).md), The brazen altar (says
he) shall be for me to enquire by. Having thrust it out from the use for
which it was instituted, which was to sanctify the gifts offered upon
it, he pretends to advance it above its institution, which it is common
for superstitious people to do. The altar was never designed for an
oracle, yet Ahaz will have it for that use. The Romish church seemingly
magnifies Christ's sacraments, yet wretchedly corrupts them. But some
give another sense of Ahaz's purpose: "As for the brazen altar, I will
consider what to do with it, and give order about it." The Jews say
that, afterwards, of the brass of it he made that famous dial which was
called the dial of Ahaz, [Kg2 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#011.md).
The base compliance of the poor-spirited priest with the presumptuous
usurpations of an ill-spirited king is again taken notice of ([Kg2
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#016).md): Urijah the priest did
according to all that king Ahaz commanded. Miserable is the case of
great men when those that should reprove them for their sins strengthen
and serve them in their sins.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 16:17</span></span>

Here is, I. Ahaz abusing the temple, not the building itself, but some
of the furniture of it. 1. He defaced the bases on which the lavers were
set ([Kg1 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#028.md), [Kg1
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#029).md) and took down the molten sea,
[Kg2 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#017.md). These the priests used for
washing; against them therefore he seems to have had a particular spite.
It is one of the greatest prejudices that can be done to religion to
obstruct the purifying of the priests, the Lord's ministers. 2. He
removed the covert for the sabbath, erected either in honour of the
sabbath or for the conveniency of the priests, when, on the sabbath,
they officiated in greater numbers than on other days. Whatever it was,
it should seem that in removing it he intended to put a contempt upon
the sabbath, and so to open as wide an inlet as any to all manner of
impiety. 3. The king's entry, which led to the house of the Lord, for
the convenience of the royal family (perhaps that ascent which Solomon
had made, and which the queen of Sheba admired, [Kg1
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#005).md), he turned another way, to show
that he did not intend to frequent the house of the Lord any more. This
he did for the king of Assyria, to oblige him, who perhaps returned his
visit, and found fault with this entry, as an inconvenience and
disparagement to his palace. When those that have had a ready passage to
the house of the Lord, to please their neighbours, turn it another way,
they are going down the hill apace towards their ruin.

II\. Ahaz resigning his life in the midst of his days, at thirty-six
years of age ([Kg2 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#019).md) and leaving
his kingdom to a better man, Hezekiah his son ([Kg2
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#020).md), who proved as much a friend to
the temple as he had been an enemy to it. Perhaps this very son he had
made to pass through the fire, and thereby dedicated him to Moloch; but
God, by his grace, snatched him as a brand out of the burning.
