### [Mark Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#001.md)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 13:0</span></span>

We have here the substance of that prophetical sermon which our Lord
Jesus preached, pointing at the destruction of Jerusalem, and the
consummation of all things; it was one of the last of his sermons, and
not ad populum - to the people, but ad clerum - to the clergy; it was
private, preached only to four of his disciples, with whom his secret
was. Here is, I. The occasion of his prediction - his disciples'
admiring the building of the temple ([Mar
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#001.md), [Mar
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#002).md), and their enquiry concerning
the time of the desolation of them ([Mar
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#003.md), [Mar
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#004).md). II. The predictions themselves,
1. Of the rise of deceivers ([Mar
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#005.md), [Mar
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#006.md), [Mar
13:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#021).md). 2. Of the wars of the
nations ([Mar 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#007.md), [Mar
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#008).md). 3. Of the persecution of
Christians ([Mar 13:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#009).md). 4. Of the
destruction of Jerusalem ([Mar
13:14-20](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#014).md). 5. Of the end of the world
([Mar 13:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#024).md). III. Some general
intimations concerning the time of them ([Mar
13:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#028).md). IV. Some practical
inferences from all ([Mar 13:33-37](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#033).md).

[Mark 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 13:1</span></span>

We may here see,

I. How apt many of Christ's own disciples are to idolize things that
look great, and have been long looked upon as sacred. They had heard
Christ complain of those who had made the temple a den of thieves; and
yet, when he quitted it, for the wickedness that remained in it, they
court him to be as much in love as they were with the stately structure
and adorning of it. One of them said to him, "Look, Master, what manner
of stones, and what buildings are here, [Mar
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#001.md). We never saw the like in
Galilee; O do not leave this fine place."

II\. How little Christ values external pomp, where there is not real
purity; "Seest thou these great buildings" (saith Christ), "and admirest
thou them? I tell thee, the time is at hand when there shall not be left
one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down," [Mar
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#002.md). And the sumptuousness of the
fabric shall be no security to it, no nor move any compassion in the
Lord Jesus towards it. He looks with pity upon the ruin of precious
souls, and weeps over them, for on them he has put great value; but we
do not find him look with any pity upon the ruin of a magnificent house,
when he is driven out of it by sin, for that is of small value with him.
With what little concern doth he say, Not one stone shall be left on
another! Much of the strength of the temple lay in the largeness of the
stones, and if these be thrown down, no footstep, no remembrance, of it
will remain. While any part remained standing, there might be some hopes
of the repair of it; but what hope is there, when not one stone is left
upon another?

III\. How natural it is to us to desire to know things to come, and the
times of them; more inquisitive we are apt to be about that than about
our duty. His disciples knew not how to digest this doctrine of the ruin
of the temple, which they thought must be their Master's royal palace,
and in which they expected their preferment, and to have the posts of
honour; and therefore they were in pain till they got him alone, and got
more out of him concerning this matter. As he was returning to Bethany
therefore, he sat upon the mount of Olives, over against the temple,
where he had a full view of it; and there four of them agreed to ask him
privately, what he meant by the destroying of the temple, which they
understood no more than they did the predictions of his own death, so
inconsistent was it with their scheme. Probably, though these four
proposed the question, yet Christ's discourse, in answer to it, was in
the hearing of the rest of the disciples, yet privately, that is, apart
from the multitude. Their enquiry is, When shall these things be? They
will not question, at least not seem to question, whether they shall be
or no (for their Master has said that they shall), but are willing to
hope it is a great way off. Yet they ask not precisely the day and year
(therein they were modest), but say, "Tell us what shall be the sign,
when all these things shall be fulfilled? What presages shall there be
of them, and how may we prognosticate their approach?"

[Mark 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 13:5</span></span>

Our Lord Jesus, in reply to their question, sets himself, not so much to
satisfy their curiosity as to direct their consciences; leaves them
still in the dark concerning the times and seasons, which the father has
kept in his own power, and which it was not for them to know; but gives
them the cautions which were needful, with reference to the events that
should now shortly come to pass.

I. They must take heed that they be not deceived by the seducers and
imposters that should now shortly arise ([Mar
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#005.md), [Mar
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#006).md); "Take heed lest any man deceive
you, lest, having found the true Messiah, you lose him again in the
crowd of pretenders, or be inveigled to embrace others in rivalship with
him. Many shall come in my name (not in the name of Jesus), but saying,
I am the Christ, and so claiming the dignities which I only an entitled
to." After the Jews had rejected the true Christ, they were imposed
upon, and so exposed by many false Christs, but never before; those
false Christs deceived many; Therefore take heed lest they deceive you.
Note, When many are deceived, we should thereby be awakened to look to
ourselves.

II\. They must take heed that they be not disturbed at the noise of
wars, which they should be alarmed with, [Mar
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#007.md), [Mar
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#008.md). Sin introduced wars, and they
come from men's lusts. But at some times the nations are more distracted
and wasted with wars than at other times; so it shall be now; Christ was
born into the world when there was a general peace, but soon after he
went out of the world there were general wars; Nation shall rise against
nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And what will become of them then
who are to preach the gospel to every nation? Inter arma silent leges -
Amidst the clash of arms, the voice of law is not heard. "But be not
troubled at it." 1. "Let it be no surprise to you; you are bid to expect
it, and such things must needs be, for God has appointed them, in order
to further accomplishment of his purposes, and by the wars of the Jews"
(which Josephus has given us a large account of) "God will punish the
wickedness of the Jews." 2. "Let it be no terror to you, as if your
interest were in danger of being overthrown, or your work obstructed by
these wars; you have no concern in them, and therefore need not be
apprehensive of any damage by them." Note, Those that despise the smiles
of the world, and do not court and covet them, may despise the frowns of
the world, and need not fear them. If we seek not to rise with them that
rise in the world, why should we dread falling with them that fall in
the world? 3. "Let it not be looked upon as an omen of the approaching
period of the world, for the end is not yet, [Mar
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#007.md). Think not that these wars will
bring the world to a period; no, there are other intermediate counsels
to be fulfilled betwixt that end and the end of all things, which are
designed to prepare you for the end, but not to hasten it out of due
time." 4. "Let it not be looked upon as if in them God has done his
worst; no, he has more arrows in his quiver, and they are ordained
against the persecutors; be not troubled at the wars you shall hear of,
for they are but the beginnings of sorrows, and therefore, instead of
being disturbed at them, you ought to prepare for worse; for there shall
also be earthquakes in divers places, which shall bury multitudes in the
ruins of their own houses, and there shall be famines, by which many of
the poor shall perish for want of bread, and troubles and commotions; so
that there shall be no peace to him that goes out or comes in. The world
shall be full of troubles, but be not ye troubled; without are
fightings, within are fears, but fear not ye their fear." Note, The
disciples of Christ, if it be not their own fault, may enjoy a holy
security and serenity of mind, when all about them is in the greatest
disorder.

III\. They must take heed that they be not drawn away from Christ, and
from their duty to him, by the sufferings they should meet with for
Christ's sake. Again, he saith, "Take heed to yourselves, [Mar
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#009.md). Though you may escape the sword
of war, better than some of your neighbours, because you interest not
yourselves in the public quarrels, yet be not secure; you will be
exposed to the sword of justice more than others, and the parties that
contend with one another, will unite against you. Take heed therefore
lest you deceive yourselves with the hopes of outward prosperity, and
such a temporal kingdom as you have been dreaming of, when it is through
many tribulations that you must enter into the kingdom of God. Take heed
lest you needlessly expose yourselves to trouble, and pull it upon your
own head. Take heed what you say and do, for you will have many eyes
upon you." Observe,

1\. What the trouble is which they must expect.

(1.) They shall be hated of all men; trouble enough! The thoughts of
being hated are grievous to a tender spirit, and the fruits of that
hatred must needs be a constant vexation; those that are malicious, will
be mischievous. It was not for any thing amiss in them, or done amiss by
them, that they were hated, but for Christ's name sake, because they
were called by his name, called upon his name, preached his name, and
wrought miracles in his name. The world hated them because he loved
them.

(2.) Their own relations shall betray them, those to whom they were most
nearly allied, and on whom therefore they depended for protection; "They
shall betray you, shall inform against you, and be your prosecutors." If
a father has a child that is a Christian, he shall become void of
natural affection, it shall be swallowed up in bigotry, and he shall
betray his own child to the persecutors, as if he were a worshipper of
other gods, [Deu 13:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006.md).

(3.) Their church-rulers shall inflict their censures upon them; "You
shall be delivered up to the great Sanhedrim at Jerusalem, and to the
inferior courts and consistories in other cities, and shall be beaten in
the synagogues with forty stripes at a time, as offenders against the
law which was read in the synagogue." It is no new thing for the
church's artillery, through the treachery of its officers, to be turned
against some of its best friends.

(4.) Governors and kings shall use their power against them. Because the
Jews have not power to put them to death, they shall incense the Roman
powers against them, as they did Herod against James and Peter; and they
shall cause you to be put to death, as enemies to the empire. They must
resist unto blood, and still resist.

2\. What they shall have to comfort themselves with, in the midst of
these great and sore troubles.

(1.) That the work they were called to should be carried on and prosper,
notwithstanding all this opposition which they should meet with in it
([Mar 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#010).md); "The gospel shall, for
all this, be published among all nations, and before the destruction of
Jerusalem the sound of it shall go forth into all the earth; not only
through all the nation of the Jews, but to all the nations of the
earth." It is comfort to those who suffer for the gospel, that, though
they may be crushed and borne down, the gospel cannot; it shall keep its
ground, and carry the day.

(2.) That their sufferings, instead of obstructing their work, should
forward it; "Your being brought before governors and kings shall be for
a testimony of them (so some read it, [Mar
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#009).md); it shall give you an
opportunity of preaching the gospel to those before whom you are brought
as criminals, to whom otherwise you could not have access." Thus St.
Paul's being brought before Felix, and Festus, and Agrippa, and Nero,
was a testimony to them concerning Christ and his gospel. Or, as we read
it, It shall be for a testimony against them, against both the judges
and the prosecutors, who pursue those with the utmost rage that appear,
upon examination, to be not only innocent but excellent persons. The
gospel is a testimony to us concerning Christ and heaven. If we receive
it, it will be a testimony for us: it will justify and save us; if not,
it will be a testimony against us in the great day.

(3.) That, when they were brought before kings and governors for
Christ's sake, they should have special assistance from heaven, to plead
Christ's cause and their own ([Mar
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#011).md); "Take no thought before-hand
what he shall speak, be not solicitous how to address yourselves to
great men, so as to obtain their favour; your cause is just and
glorious, and needs not be supported by premeditated speeches and
harangues; but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, whatsoever
shall be suggested to you, and put into your minds, and into your
mouths" (pro re nat - on the spur of the occasion), "that speak ye, and
fear not the success of it, because it is off-hand, for it is not ye
that speak, purely by the strength of your own wisdom, consideration,
and resolution, but it is the Holy Ghost." Note, Those whom Christ calls
out to be advocates for him, shall be furnished with full instructions:
and when we are engaged in the service of Christ, we may depend upon the
aids of the Spirit of Christ.

(4.) That heaven at last would make amends for all; "You will meet with
a great deal of hardship in your way, but have a good heart on it, your
warfare will be accomplished, and your testimony finished, and he that
shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved," [Mar
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#013.md). Perseverance gains the crown.
The salvation here promised is more than a deliverance from evil, it is
an everlasting blessedness, which shall be an abundant recompence for
all their services and sufferings. All this we have, [Mat
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#017.md), etc.

[Mark 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 13:14</span></span>

The Jews, in rebelling against the Romans, and in persecuting the
Christians, were hastening to their own ruin apace, both efficiently and
meritoriously, were setting both God and man against them; see [Th1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#015.md). Now here we have a prediction of
that ruin which came upon them within less than forty years after this:
we had it before, [Mat 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015.md), etc.
Observe,

I. What is here foretold concerning it.

1\. That the Roman armies should make a descent upon Judea, and invest
Jerusalem, the holy city. These were the abomination of desolation,
which the Jews did abominate, and by which they should be made desolate.
The country of thine enemy is called the land which thou abhorrest, [Isa
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#016.md). Therefore it was an abomination,
because it brought with it nothing but desolation. They had rejected
Christ as an abomination, who would have been their salvation; and now
God brought upon them an abomination that would be their desolation,
thus spoken of by Daniel the prophet ([Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027).md), as that by which this sacrifice
and offering should be made to cease. This army stood where it ought
not, in and about the holy city, which the heathen ought not to have
approached, nor would have been suffered to approach, if Jerusalem had
not first profaned the crown of their holiness. This the church
complains of, [Lam 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#010.md), The heathen
entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command that they should not
enter into the congregation; but sin made the breach, at which the glory
went out, and the abomination of desolation broke in, and stood where it
ought not. Now, let him that readeth this, understand it, and endeavor
to take it right. Prophecies should not be too plain, and yet
intelligible to those that search them; and they are best understood by
comparing them first with one another, and at last with the event.

2\. That when the Roman army should come into the country, there would
be no safety any where but by quitting the country, and that with all
possible expedition. It will be in vain to fight, the enemies will be
too hard for them; in vain to abscond, the enemies will find them out;
and in vain to capitulate, the enemies will give them no quarter; a man
cannot have so much as his life given him for a prey, but by fleeing to
the mountains out of Judea; and let him take the first alarm, and make
the best of his way. If he be on the house-top, trying from thence to
discover the motions of the enemy, and spies them coming, let him not go
down, to take any thing out of the house, for it will occasion his
losing of time, which is more precious than his best goods, and will but
encumber him, and embarrass his flight. If he be in the field, and there
discover the approach of the enemy, let him get away as he is, and not
turn back again, to take up his garment, [Mar
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#016.md). If he can save his life, let
him reckon it is a good bargain, though he can save nothing else, and be
thankful to God, that, though he is cut short, he is not cut off.

3\. That it would go very hard at that time with poor mothers and nurses
([Mar 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#017).md); "Woe to them that are
with child, that dare not go into strange places, that cannot shift for
themselves, nor make haste as others can. And woe to them that give
suck, that know not how either to leave the tender infants behind them,
or to carry them along with them." Such is the vanity of the creature,
that the time may often be, when the greatest comforts may prove the
greatest burthens. It would likewise be very uncomfortable, if they
should be forced to flee in the winter ([Mar
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#018).md), when the weather and ways were
bad, when the roads would be scarcely passable, especially in the
mountains to which they must flee. If there be no remedy but that
trouble must come, yet we may desire and pray that, if it be God's will,
the circumstances of it may be so ordered as to be a mitigation of the
trouble; and when things are bad, we ought to consider they might have
been worse. It is bad to be forced to flee, but it would have been worse
if it had been in the winter.

4\. That throughout all the country of the Jews, there should be such
destruction and desolation made, as could not be paralleled in any
history ([Mar 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#019).md); In those days
shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of time; that
is, of the creation which God created, for time and the creation are of
equal date, unto this day, neither shall be to the end of time; such a
complication of miseries, and of such continuance. The destruction of
Jerusalem by the Chaldeans was very terrible, but this exceeded it. It
threatened a universal slaughter of all the people of the Jews; so
barbarously did they devour one another, and the Romans devour them all,
that, if their wars had continued a little longer, no flesh could have
been saved, not one Jew could have been left alive; but in the midst of
wrath God remembered mercy; and, (1.) He shortened the days; he let fall
his controversy before he had made a full end. As a church and nation
the ruin was complete, but many particular persons had their lives given
them for a prey, by the storm's subsiding when it did. 2. It was for the
elects' sake that those days were shortened; many among them fared the
better for the sake of the few among them that believed in Christ, and
were faithful to him. There was a promise, that a remnant should be
saved ([Isa 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022).md), and that God would
not, for his servants' sakes, destroy them all ([Isa
65:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#008).md); and these promises must be
fulfilled. God's own elect cry day and night to him, and their prayers
must be answered, [Luk 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#007.md).

II\. What directions are given to the disciples with reference to it.

1\. They must shift for the safety of their lives; "When you see the
country invaded, and the city invested, flatter not yourselves with
thoughts that the enemy will retire, or that you may be able to make
your part good with them; but, without further deliberation or delay,
let them that are in Judea, flee to the mountains, [Mar
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#014.md). Meddle not with the strife that
belongs not to you; let the potsherds strive with the potsherds of the
earth, but do you go out of the ship when you see it sinking, that you
die not the death of the uncircumcised in heart."

2\. They must provide for the safety of their souls; "Seducers will be
busy at that time, for they love to fish in troubled waters, and
therefore then you must double your guard; then, if any man shall say
unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or, Lo, he is there, you know he is in
heaven, and will come again at the end of time, to judge the world, and
therefore believe them not; having received Christ, be not drawn into
the snares of any antichrist; for false Christs, and false prophets,
shall arise," [Mar 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#022.md). When the
gospel kingdom was in the setting up, Satan mustered all his force, to
oppose it, and made use of all his wiles; and God permitted it, for the
trial of sincerity of some, and the discovery of the hypocrisy of
others, and the confusion of those who rejected Christ, when he was
offered to them. False Christs shall rise, and false prophets that shall
preach them up; or such, as, though they pretend not to be Christs, set
up for prophets, and undertake to foretel things to come, and they shall
show signs and lying wonders; so early did the mystery of iniquity begin
to work, [Th2 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#007.md). They shall seduce,
if it were possible, the very elect; so plausible shall their pretences
be, and so industrious shall they be to impose upon people, that they
shall drawn away many that were forward and zealous professors of
religion, many that were very likely to have persevered; for nothing
will be effectual to secure men but that foundation of God which stands
immovably sure, The Lord knoweth them that are his, who shall be
preserved when the faith of some is overthrown, [Ti2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018.md), [Ti2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019.md). They shall seduce, if it were
possible, the very elect; but it is not possible to seduce them; the
election shall obtain, whoever are blinded, [Rom
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#007.md). But, in consideration hereof,
let the disciples be cautious whom they give credit to ([Mar
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#023).md); But take ye heed. Christ knew
that they were of the elect, who could not possibly be seduced, and yet
he said to them, Take heed. An assurance of persevering, and cautions
against apostasy, will very well consist with each other. Though Christ
said to them, Take heed, it doth not therefore follow, that their
perseverance was doubtful, for they were kept by the power of God; and
though their perseverance was secured, yet it doth not therefore follow,
that this caution was needless, because they must be kept in the use of
proper means. God will keep them, but they must keep themselves. "I have
foretold you all things; have foretold you of this danger, that, being
fore-warned, you may be fore-armed; I have foretold all things which you
needed to have foretold to you, and therefore take heed of hearkening to
such as pretend to be prophets, and to foretel more than I have
foretold." The sufficiency of the scripture is good argument against
listening to such as pretend to inspiration.

[Mark 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 13:24</span></span>

These verses seem to point at Christ's second coming, to judge the
world; the disciples, in their question, had confounded the destruction
of Jerusalem and the end of the world ([Mat
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#003).md), which was built upon a mistake,
as if the temple must needs stand as long as the world stands; this
mistake Christ rectifies, and shows that the end of the world in those
days, those other days you enquire about, the day of Christ's coming,
and the day of judgment, shall be after that tribulation, and not
coincident with it. Let those who live to see the Jewish nation
destroyed, take heed of thinking that, because the Son of man doth not
visibly come in the clouds then, he will never so come; no, he will come
after that. And here he foretels,

1\. The final dissolution of the present frame and fabric of the world;
even of that part of it which seems least liable to change, the upper
part, the pure and more refined part; The sun shall be darkened, and the
moon shall no more give her light; for they shall be quite outshone by
the glory of the Son of man, [Isa
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023.md). The stars of heaven, that from
the beginning had kept their place and regular motion, shall fall as
leaves in autumn; and the powers that are in heaven, the heavenly
bodies, the fixed stars, shall be shaken.

2\. The visible appearance of the Lord Jesus, to whom the judgment of
that day shall be committed ([Mar
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#026).md); Then shall they see the Son of
man coming in the clouds. Probably he will come over that very place
where he sat when he said this; for the clouds are in the lower region
of the air. He shall come with great power and glory, such as will be
suited to the errand on which he comes. Every eye shall then see him.

3\. The gathering together of all the elect to him ([Mar
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#027).md); He shall send his angels, and
gather together his elect to him, to meet him in the air, [Th1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017.md). They shall be fetched from one
end of the world to the other, so that none shall be missing from that
general assembly; they shall be fetched from the uttermost part of the
earth, most remote from the places where Christ's tribunal shall be set,
and shall be brought to the uttermost part of heaven; so sure, so swift,
so easy, shall their conveyance be, that there shall none of them
miscarry, though they were to be brought from the uttermost part of the
earth one way, to the uttermost part of the heaven another way. A
faithful Israelite shall be carried safely, though it were from the
utmost border of the land of bondage to the utmost border of the land of
promise.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 13:28</span></span>

We have here the application of this prophetical sermon; now learn to
look forward in a right manner.

I. "As to the destruction of Jerusalem, expect it to come very shortly;
as when the branch of the fig-tree becomes soft, and the leaves sprout
forth, ye expect that summer will come shortly, [Mar
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#028.md). When second causes begin to
work, ye expect their effects in their proper order and time. So when ye
see these things come to pass, when ye see the Jewish nation embroiled
in wars, distracted by false Christs and prophets, and drawing upon them
the displeasure of the Romans, especially when ye see them persecuting
you for your Master's sake, and thereby standing to what they did when
they put him to death, and repeating it, and so filling up the measure
of their iniquity, then say that their ruin is nigh, even at the door,
and provide for yourselves accordingly." The disciples themselves were
indeed all of them, except John, taken away from the evil to come, but
the next generation whom they were to train up, would live to see it;
and by these instructions which Christ left behind him would be kept
from sharing in it; "This generation that is now rising up, shall not
all be worn off before all these things come to pass, which I have told
you of, relating to Jerusalem, and they shall begin to take effect now
shortly. And as this destruction is near and within ken, so it is sure.
The decree is gone forth, it is a consummation determined," [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md). Christ doth not speak these
things, merely to frighten them; no, they are declarations of God's
fixed purpose; "Heaven and earth shall pass away, at the end of time;
but my words shall not pass away ([Mar
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#031).md), not one of these predictions
shall fail of a punctual accomplishment."

II\. "As to the end of the world, do not enquire when it will come, for
it is not a question fit to be asked, for of that day, and that hour,
knoweth no man; it is a thing at a great distance; the exact time is
fixed in the counsel of God, but is not revealed by any word of God,
either to men on earth, or to angels in heaven; the angels shall have
timely notice to prepare to attend in that day, and it shall be
published, when it comes to the children of men, with sound of trumpet;
but, at present, men and angels are kept in the dark concerning the
precise time of it, that they may both attend to their proper services
in the present day." But it follows, neither the Son; but is there any
thing which the Son is ignorant of? We read indeed of a book which was
sealed, till the Lamb opened the seals; but did not he know what was in
it, before the seals were opened? Was not he privy to the writing of it?
There were those in the primitive times, who taught from this text, that
there were some things that Christ, as man, was ignorant of; and from
these were called Agnoetae; they said, "It was no more absurd to say so,
than to say that his human soul suffered grief and fear;" and many of
the orthodox fathers approved of this. Some would evade it, by saying
that Christ spoke this in a way of prudential economy, to divert the
disciples from further enquiry: but to this one of the ancients answers,
It is not fit to speak too nicely in this matter - ou dei panu
akribologein, so Leontius in Dr. Hammond, "It is certain (says
Archbishop Tillotson) that Christ, as God, could not be ignorant of any
thing; but the divine wisdom which dwelt in our Saviour, did communicate
itself to his human soul, according to the divine pleasure, so that his
human nature might sometimes not know some things; therefore Christ is
said to grow in wisdom ([Luk 2:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#052).md),
which he could not be said to do, if the human nature of Christ did
necessarily know all things by virtue of its union with the divinity."
Dr. Lightfoot explains it thus; Christ calls himself the Son, as
Messiah. Now the Messiah, as such, was the father's servant ([Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001).md), sent and deputed by him, and as
such a one he refers himself often to his Father's will and command, and
owns he did nothing of himself ([Joh
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019).md); in like manner he might be said
to know nothing of himself. The revelation of Jesus Christ was what God
gave unto him, [Rev 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001.md). He thinks,
therefore, that we are to distinguish between those excellencies and
perfections of his, which resulted from the personal union between the
divine and human nature, and those which flowed from the anointing of
the Spirit; from the former flowed the infinite dignity of his perfect
freedom from all sin; but from the latter flowed his power of working
miracles, and his foreknowledge of things to come. What therefore (saith
he) was to be revealed by him to his church, he was pleased to take, not
from the union of the human nature with the divine, but from the
revelation of the Spirit, by which he yet knew not this, but the Father
only knows it; that is, God only, the Deity; for (as Archbishop
Tillotson explains it) it is not used here personally, in distinction
from the Son and the Holy Ghost, but as the Father is, Fons et
Principium Deitatis - The Fountain of Deity.

III\. "As to both, your duty is to watch and pray. Therefore the time is
kept a secret, that you may be engaged to stand always upon your guard
([Mar 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#033).md); Take ye heed of every
thing that would indispose you for your Master's coming, and would
render your accounts perplexed, and your spirits so too; watch for his
coming, that it may not at any time be a surprise to you, and pray for
that grace which is necessary to qualify you for it, for ye know not
when the time is; and you are concerned to be ready for that every day,
which may come any day." This he illustrates, in the close, by a
parable.

1\. Our Master is gone away, and left us something in trust, in charge,
which we must give account of, [Mar
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#034.md). He is as a man taking a far
journey; for he is gone to be away a great while, he has left his house
on earth, and left his servants in their offices, given authority to
some, who are to be overseers, and work to others, who are to be
labourers. They that have authority given them, in that had work
assigned them, for those that have the greatest power have the most
business; and to them to whom he gave work, he gave some sort of
authority, to do that work. And when he took his last leave, he
appointed the porter to watch, to be sure to be ready to open to him at
his return; and in the mean time to take care to whom he opened his
gates, not to thieves and robbers, but only to his Master's friends and
servants. Thus our Lord Jesus, when he ascended on high, left something
for all his servants to do, expecting they should all do him service in
his absence, and be ready to receive him at his return. All are
appointed to work, and some authorized to rule.

2\. We ought to be always upon our watch, in expectation of his return,
[Mar 13:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#035). (1..md) Our Lord will
come, and will come as the Master of the house, to take account of his
servants, of their work, and of the improvement they have made. (2.) We
know not when he will come; and he has very wisely kept us at
uncertainty, that we might all be always ready. We know not when he will
come, just at what precise time; the Master of the house perhaps will
come at even, at nine at night; or it may be at midnight, or a
cock-crowing, at three in the morning, or perhaps not until six. This is
applicable to his coming to us in particular, at our death, as well as
to the general judgment. Our present life is a night, a dark night,
compared with the other life; we know not in which watch of the night
our Master will come, whether in the days of youth, or middle age, or
old age; but, as soon as we are born, we begin to die, and therefore, as
soon as we are capable of expecting any thing, we must expect death.
(3.) Our great care must be, that, whenever our Lord comes, he do not
find us sleeping, secure in ourselves, off our guard, indulging
ourselves in ease and sloth, mindless of our work and duty, and
thoughtless of our Lord's coming; ready to say, He will not come, and
unready to meet him. (4.) His coming will indeed be coming suddenly; it
will be a great surprise and terror to those that are careless, and
asleep, it will come upon them as a thief in the night. (5.) It is
therefore the indispensable duty of all Christ's disciples, to watch, to
be awake, and keep awake; "What I say unto you four ([Mar
13:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#037).md), I say unto all the twelve, or
rather to you twelve, I say unto all my disciples and followers; what I
say to you of this generation, I say to all that shall believe in men,
through your word, in every age, Watch, watch, expect my second coming,
prepare for it, that you may be found in peace, without spot, and
blameless."
