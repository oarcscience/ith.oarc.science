### [Exodus Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 4:0</span></span>

This chapter, I. Continues and concludes God's discourse with Moses at
the bush concerning this great affair of bringing Israel out of Egypt.
1. Moses objects the people's unbelief ([Exo
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#001).md), and God answers that objection
by giving him a power to work miracles, (1.) To turn his rod into a
serpent, and then into a rod again ([Exo
4:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#002)). (2..md) To make his hand leprous,
and then whole again ([Exo 4:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#006).md).
(3.) To turn the water into blood ([Exo
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#009).md). 2. Moses objects his own
slowness of speech ([Exo 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#010).md), and
begs to be excused ([Exo 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#013).md); but
God answers this objection, (1.) By promising him his presence ([Exo
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#011.md), [Exo
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#012)). (2..md) By joining Aaron in
commission with him ([Exo 4:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#014).md).
(3.) By putting an honour upon the very staff in his hand ([Exo
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#017).md). II. It begins Moses's execution
of his commission. 1. He obtains leave of his father-in-law to return
into Egypt ([Exo 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#018).md). 2. He receives
further instructions and encouragements from God ([Exo
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#019.md), [Exo
4:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021).md). 3. He hastens his departure,
and takes his family with him ([Exo
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#020).md). 4. He meets with some
difficulty in the way about the circumcising of his son ([Exo
4:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#024).md). 5. He has the satisfaction
of meeting his brother Aaron ([Exo
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#027.md), [Exo
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#028).md). 6. He produces his commission
before the elders of Israel, to their great joy ([Exo
4:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#029).md). And thus the wheels were set
a going towards that great deliverance.

[Exodus 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 4:1</span></span>

It was a very great honour that Moses was called to when God
commissioned him to bring Israel out of Egypt; yet he is with difficulty
persuaded to accept the commission, and does it at last with great
reluctance, which we should rather impute to a humble diffidence of
himself and his own sufficiency than to any unbelieving distrust of God
and his word and power. Note, Those whom God designs for preferment he
clothes with humility; the most fit for service are the least forward.

I. Moses objects that in all probability the people would not hearken to
his voice ([Exo 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#001).md), that is, they
would not take his bare word, unless he showed them some sign, which he
had not been yet instructed to do. This objection cannot be justified,
because it contradicts what God had said ([Exo
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#018).md), They shall hearken to thy
voice. If God says, They will, does it become Moses to say, They will
not? Surely he means, "Perhaps they will not at first, or some of them
will not." If there should be some gainsayers among them who would
question his commission, how should he deal with them? And what course
should he take to convince them? He remembered how they had once
rejected him, and feared it would be so again. Note, 1. Present
discouragements often arise from former disappointments. 2. Wise and
good men have sometimes a worse opinion of people than they deserve.
Moses sad ([Exo 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#001).md), They will not
believe me; and yet he was happily mistaken, for it is said ([Exo
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#031).md), The people believed; but then
the signs which God appointed in answer to this objection were first
wrought in their sight.

II\. God empowers him to work miracles, directs him to three
particularly, two of which were now immediately wrought for his own
satisfaction. Note, True miracles are the most convincing external
proofs of a divine mission attested by them. Therefore our Saviour often
appealed to his works (as [Joh 5:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#036).md),
and Nicodemus owns himself convinced by them, [Joh
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#002.md). And here Moses, having a special
commission given him as a judge and lawgiver to Israel, has this seal
affixed to his commission, and comes supported by these credentials.

1\. The rod in his hand is made the subject of a miracle, a double
miracle: it is but thrown out of his hand and it becomes a serpent; he
resumes it and it becomes a rod again, [Exo
4:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#002). Now, (1..md) Here was a divine
power manifested in the change itself, that a dry stick should be turned
into a living serpent, a lively one, so formidable a one that Moses
himself, on whom, it should seem, it turned in some threatening manner,
fled from before it, though we may suppose, in that desert, serpents
were no strange things to him; but what was produced miraculously was
always the best and strongest of the kind, as the water turned to wine:
and, then, that this living serpent should be turned into a dry stick
again, this was the Lord's doing. (2.) Here was an honour put upon
Moses, that this change was wrought upon his throwing it down and taking
it up, without any spell, or charm, or incantation: his being empowered
thus to act under God, out of the common course of nature and
providence, was a demonstration of his authority, under God, to settle a
new dispensation of the kingdom of grace. We cannot imagine that the God
of truth would delegate such a power as this to an impostor. (3.) There
was a significancy in the miracle itself. Pharaoh had turned the rod of
Israel into a serpent, representing them as dangerous ([Exo
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#010).md), causing their belly to cleave
to the dust, and seeking their ruin; but now they should be turned into
a rod again: or, thus Pharaoh had turned the rod of government into the
serpent of oppression, from which Moses had himself fled into Midian;
but by the agency of Moses the scene was altered again. (4.) There was a
direct tendency in it to convince the children of Israel that Moses was
indeed sent of God to do what he did, [Exo
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#005.md). Miracles were for signs to those
that believed not, [Co1 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#022.md).

2\. His hand itself is next made the subject of a miracle. He puts it
once into his bosom, and takes it out leprous; he puts it again into the
same place, and takes it out well, [Exo
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#006.md), [Exo
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#007). This signified, (1..md) That Moses,
by the power of God, should bring sore diseases upon Egypt, and that, at
his prayer, they should be removed. (2.) That whereas the Israelites in
Egypt had become leprous, polluted by sin, and almost consumed by
oppression (a leper is as one dead, [Num
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#012).md), by being taken into the bosom
of Moses they should be cleansed and cured, and have all their
grievances redressed. (3.) That Moses was not to work miracles by his
own power, nor for his own praise, but by the power of God and for his
glory; the leprous hand of Moses does for ever exclude boasting. Now it
was supposed that, if the former sign did not convince, this latter
would. Note, God is willing more abundantly to show the truth of his
word, and is not sparing in his proofs; the multitude and variety of the
miracles corroborate the evidence.

3\. He is directed, when he shall come to Egypt, to turn some of the
water of the river into blood, [Exo
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#009.md). This was done, at first, as a
sign, but, not gaining due credit with Pharaoh, the whole river was
afterwards turned into blood, and then it became a plague. He is ordered
to work this miracle in case they would not be convinced by the other
two. Note, Unbelief shall be left inexcusable, and convicted of a wilful
obstinacy. As to the people of Israel, God had said ([Exo
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#018).md), They shall hearken; yet he
appoints these miracles to be wrought for their conviction, for he that
has ordained the end has ordained the means.

[Exodus 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 4:10</span></span>

Moses still continues backward to the service for which God had designed
him, even to a fault; for now we can no longer impute it to his humility
and modesty, but must own that here was too much of cowardice,
slothfulness, and unbelief in it. Observe here,

I. How Moses endeavours to excuse himself from the work.

1\. He pleads that he was no good spokesman: O my Lord! I am not
eloquent, [Exo 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#010.md). He was a great
philosopher, statesman, and divine, and yet no orator; a man of a clear
head, great thought, and solid judgment, but had not a voluble tongue,
or ready utterance, and therefore he thought himself unfit to speak
before great men about great affairs, and in danger of being run down by
the Egyptians. Observe, (1.) We must not judge of men by the readiness
and fluency of their discourse. Moses was mighty in word ([Act
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#022).md), and yet not eloquent: what he
said was strong and nervous, and to the purpose, and distilled as the
dew ([Deu 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002).md), though he did not
deliver himself with that readiness, ease, and elegance, that some do,
who have not the tenth part of his sense. St. Paul's speech was
contemptible, [Co2 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010.md). A great deal
of wisdom and true worth is concealed by a slow tongue. (2.) God is
pleased sometimes to make choice of those as his messengers who have
fewest of the advantages of art or nature, that his grace in them may
appear the more glorious. Christ's disciples were no orators, till the
Spirit made them such.

2\. When this plea was overruled, and all his excuses were answered, he
begged that God would send somebody else on this errand and leave him to
keep sheep in Midian ([Exo 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#013).md):
"Send by any hand but mine; thou canst certainly find one much more
fit." Note, An unwilling mind will take up with a sorry excuse rather
than none, and is willing to devolve those services upon others that
have any thing of difficulty or danger in them.

II\. How God condescends to answer all his excuses. Though the anger of
the Lord was kindled against him ([Exo
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#014).md), yet he continued to reason with
him, till he had overcome him. Note, Even self-diffidence, when it grows
into an extreme - when it either hinders us from duty or clogs us in
duty, or when it discourages our dependence upon the grace of God - is
very displeasing to him. God justly resents our backwardness to serve
him, and has reason to take it ill; for he is such a benefactor as is
before-hand with us, and such a rewarder as will not be behind-hand with
us. Note further, God is justly displeased with those whom yet he does
not reject: he vouchsafes to reason the case even with his froward
children, and overcomes them, as he did Moses here, with grace and
kindness.

1\. To balance the weakness of Moses, he here reminds him of his own
power, [Exo 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#011). (1..md) His power in
that concerning which Moses made the objection: Who has made man's
mouth? Have not I the Lord? Moses knew that God made man, but he must be
reminded now that God made man's mouth. An eye to God as Creator would
help us over a great many of the difficulties which lie in the way of
our duty, [Psa 124:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#008.md). God, as the
author of nature, has given us the power and faculty of speaking; and
from him, as the fountain of gifts and graces, comes the faculty of
speaking well, the mouth and wisdom ([Luk
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#015).md), the tongue of the learned
([Isa 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004).md); he pours grace into the
lips, [Psa 45:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#002). (2..md) His power in
general over the other faculties. Who but God makes the dumb and the
deaf, the seeing and the blind? \[1.\] The perfections of our faculties
are his work, he makes the seeing; he formed the eye ([Psa
94:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#009).md); he opens the understanding, the
eye of the mind, [Luk 24:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#045.md). \[2.\]
Their imperfections are from him too; he make the dumb, and deaf, and
blind. Is there any evil of this kind, and the Lord has not done it? No
doubt he has, and always in wisdom and righteousness, and for his own
glory, [Joh 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#003.md). Pharaoh and the
Egyptians were made deaf and blind spiritually, as [Isa
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009.md), [Isa
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010.md). But God knew how to manage them,
and get himself honour upon them.

2\. To encourage him in this great undertaking, he repeats the promise
of his presence, not only in general, I will be with thee ([Isa
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#012).md), but in particular, "I will be
with thy mouth, so that the imperfection in thy speech shall be no
prejudice to thy message." It does not appear that God did immediately
remove the infirmity, whatever it was; but he did that which was
equivalent, he taught him what to say, and then let the matter recommend
itself: if others spoke more gracefully, none spoke more powerfully.
Note, Those whom God employs to speak for him ought to depend upon him
for instructions, and it shall be given them what they shall speak, [Mat
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#019.md).

3\. He joins Aaron in commission with him. He promises that Aaron shall
meet him opportunely, and that he will be glad to see him, they having
not seen one another (it is likely) for many years, [Exo
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#014.md). He directs him to make use of
Aaron as his spokesman, [Exo 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#016.md). God
might have laid Moses wholly aside, for his backwardness to be employed;
but he considered his frame, and ordered him an assistant. Observe, (1.)
Two are better than one, [Ecc 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#009.md). God
will have his two witnesses ([Rev
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#003).md), that out of their mouths every
word may be established. (2.) Aaron was the brother of Moses, divine
wisdom so ordering it, that their natural affection one to another might
strengthen their union in the joint execution of their commission.
Christ sent his disciples two and two, and some of the couples were
brothers. (3.) Aaron was the elder brother, and yet he was willing to be
employed under Moses in this affair, because God would have it so. (4.)
Aaron could speak well, and yet was far inferior to Moses in wisdom. God
dispenses his gifts variously to the children of men, that we may see
our need one of another, and each may contribute something to the good
of the body, [Co1 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#021.md). The tongue of
Aaron, with the head and heart of Moses, would make one completely fit
for this embassy. (5.) God promises, I will be with thy mouth, and with
his mouth. Even Aaron, that could speak well, yet could not speak to
purpose unless God was with his mouth; without the constant aids of
divine grace the best gifts will fail.

4\. He bids him take the rod with him in his hand ([Exo
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#017).md), to intimate that he must bring
about his undertaking rather by acting than by speaking; the signs he
should work with this rod might abundantly supply the want of eloquence;
one miracle would do him better service than all the rhetoric in the
world. Take this rod, the rod he carried as a shepherd, that he might
not be ashamed of that mean condition out of which God called him. This
rod must be his staff of authority, and must be to him instead both of
sword and sceptre.

[Exodus 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 4:18</span></span>

Here, I. Moses obtains leave of his father-in-law to return into Egypt,
[Exo 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#018.md). His father-in-law had been
kind to him when he was a stranger, and therefore he would not be so
uncivil as to leave his family, nor so unjust as to leave his service,
without giving him notice. Note, The honour of being admitted into
communion with God, and of being employed for him, does not exempt us
from the duties of our relations and callings in this world. Moses said
nothing to his father-in-law (for aught that appears) of the glorious
manifestation of God to him; such favours we are to be thankful for to
God, but not to boast of before men.

II\. He receives from God further encouragements and directions in his
work. After God had appeared to him in the bush to settle a
correspondence, it should seem, he often spoke to him, as there was
occasion, with less overwhelming solemnity. And, 1. He assures Moses
that the coasts were clear. Whatever new enemies he might make by his
undertaking, his old enemies were all dead, all that sought his life,
[Exo 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#019.md). Perhaps some secret fear of
falling into their hands was at the bottom of Moses's backwardness to go
to Egypt, though he was not willing to own it, but pleaded unworthiness,
insufficiency, want of elocution, etc. Note, God knows all the
temptations his people lie under, and how to arm them against their
secret fears, [Psa 142:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#003.md). 2. He orders
him to do the miracles, not only before the elders of Israel, but before
Pharaoh, [Exo 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021.md). There were some
alive perhaps in the court of Pharaoh who remembered Moses when he was
the son of Pharaoh's daughter, and had many a time called him a fool for
deserting the honours of that relation; but he is now sent back to
court, clad with greater powers than Pharaoh's daughter could have
advanced him to, so that it might appear he was no loser by his choice:
this wonder-working rod did more adorn the hand of Moses than the
sceptre of Egypt could have done. Note, Those that look with contempt
upon worldly honours shall be recompensed with the honour that cometh
from God, which is the true honour. 3. That Pharaoh's obstinacy might be
no surprise nor discouragement to him, God tells him before that he
would harden his heart. Pharaoh had hardened his own heart against the
groans and cries of the oppressed Israelites, and shut up the bowels of
his compassion from them; and now God, in a way of righteous judgment,
hardens his heart against the conviction of the miracles, and the terror
of the plagues. Note, Ministers must expect with many to labour in vain:
we must not think it strange if we meet with those who will not be
wrought upon by the strongest arguments and fairest reasonings; yet our
judgment is with the Lord. 4. Words are put into his mouth with which to
address Pharaoh, [Exo 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022.md), [Exo
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#023.md). God had promised him ([Exo
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#012).md), I will teach thee what thou
shalt say; and here he does teach him. (1.) He must deliver his message
in the name of the great Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord; this is the first
time that preface is used by any man which afterwards is used so
frequently by all the prophets: whether Pharaoh will hear, or whether he
will forbear, Moses must tell him, Thus saith the Lord. (2.) He must let
Pharaoh know Israel's relation to God, and God's concern for Israel. Is
Israel a servant? is he a home-born slave? [Jer
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#014.md). "No, Israel is my son, my
firstborn, precious in my sight, honourable, and dear to me, not to be
thus insulted and abused." (3.) He must demand a discharge for them:
"Let my son go; not only my servant whom thou hast no right to detain,
but my son whose liberty and honour I am very jealous for. It is my son,
my son that serves me, and therefore must be spared, must be pleaded
for," [Mal 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#017). (4..md) He must threaten
Pharaoh with the death of the first-born of Egypt, in case of a refusal:
I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn. As men deal with God's people,
let them expect to be themselves dealt with; with the froward he will
wrestle.

III\. Moses addresses himself to this expedition. When God had assured
him ([Exo 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#019).md) that the men were dead
who sought his life, immediately it follows ([Exo
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#020).md), he took his wife, and his sons,
and set out for Egypt. Note, Though corruption may object much against
the services God calls us to, yet grace will get the upper hand, and
will be obedient to the heavenly vision.

[Exodus 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">exo 4:24</span></span>

Moses is here going to Egypt, and we are told,

I. How God met him in anger, [Exo
4:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#024.md). This is a very difficult
passage of story; much has been written, and excellently written, to
make it intelligible; we will try to make it improving. Here is,

1\. The sin of Moses, which was neglecting to circumcise his son. This
was probably the effect of his being unequally yoked with a Midianite,
who was too indulgent of her child, while Moses was too indulgent of
her. Note, (1.) We have need to watch carefully over our own hearts,
lest fondness for any relation prevail above our love to God, and take
us off from our duty to him. It is charged upon Eli that he honoured his
sons more than God ([Sa1 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#029).md); and
see [Mat 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#037). (2..md) Even good men are
apt to cool in their zeal for God and duty when they have long been
deprived of the society of the faithful: solitude has its advantages,
but they seldom counterbalance the loss of Christian communion.

2\. God's displeasure against him. He met him, and, probably by a sword
in an angel's hand, sought to kill him. This was a great change; very
lately God was conversing with him, and lodging a trust in him, as a
friend; and now he is coming forth against him as an enemy. Note, (1.)
Omissions are sins, and must come into judgment, and particularly the
contempt and neglect of the seals of the covenant; for it is a sign that
we undervalue the promises of the covenant, and are displeased with the
conditions of it. He that has made a bargain, and is not willing to seal
and ratify it, one may justly suspect, neither likes it nor designs to
stand to it. (2.) God takes notice of, and is much displeased with, the
sins of his own people. If they neglect their duty, let them expect to
hear of it by their consciences, and perhaps to feel from it by cross
providences: for this cause many are sick and weak, as some think Moses
was here.

3\. The speedy performance of the duty for the neglect of which God had
now a controversy with him. His son must be circumcised; Moses is unable
to circumcise him; therefore, in this case of necessity, Zipporah does
it, whether with passionate words (expressing her dislike of the
ordinance itself, or at least the administration of it to so young a
child, and in a journey), as to me it seems, or with proper words -
solemnly expressing the espousal of the child to God by the covenant of
circumcision (as some read it) or her thankfulness to God for sparing
her husband, giving him a new life, and thereby giving her, as it were,
a new marriage to him, upon her circumcising her son (as others read it)
- I cannot determine: but we learn, (1.) That when God discovers to us
what is amiss in our lives we must give all diligence to amend it
speedily, and particularly return to the duties we have neglected. (2.)
The putting away of our sins is indispensably necessary to the removal
of God's judgements. This is the voice of every rod, it calls to us to
return to him that smites us.

4\. The release of Moses thereupon: So he let him go; the distemper went
off, the destroying angel withdrew, and all was well: only Zipporah
cannot forget the fright she was in, but will unreasonably call Moses a
bloody husband, because he obliged her to circumcise the child; and,
upon this occasion (it is probable), he sent them back to his
father-in-law, that they might not create him any further uneasiness.
Note, (1.) When we return to God in a way of duty he will return to us
in a way of mercy; take away the cause, and the effect will cease. (2.)
We must resolve to bear it patiently, if our zeal for God and his
institutions be misinterpreted and discouraged by some that should
understand themselves, and us, and their duty, better, as David's zeal
was misinterpreted by Michal; but if this be to be vile, if this be to
be bloody, we must be yet more so. (3.) When we have any special service
to do for God we should remove as far from us as we can that which is
likely to be our hindrance. Let the dead bury their dead, but follow
thou me.

II\. How Aaron met him in love, [Exo
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#027.md), [Exo
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#028.md). 1. God sent Aaron to meet him,
and directed him where to find him, in the wilderness that lay towards
Midian. Note, The providence of God is to be acknowledged in the
comfortable meeting of relations and friends. 2. Aaron made so much
haste, in obedience to his God, and in love to his brother, that he met
him in the mount of God, the place where God had met with him. 3. They
embraced one another with mutual endearments. The more they saw of God's
immediate direction in bringing them together the more pleasant their
interview was: they kissed, not only in token of brotherly affection,
and in remembrance of ancient acquaintance, but as a pledge of their
hearty concurrence in the work to which they were jointly called. 4.
Moses informed his brother of the commission he had received, with all
the instructions and credentials affixed to it, [Exo
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#028.md). Note, What we know of God we
should communicate for the benefit of others; and those that are
fellow-servants to God in the same work should use a mutual freedom, and
endeavour rightly and fully to understand one another.

III\. How the elders of Israel met him in faith and obedience. When
Moses and Aaron first opened their commission in Egypt, said what they
were ordered to say, and, to confirm it, did what they were ordered to
do, they met with a better reception than they promised themselves, [Exo
4:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#029.md). 1. The Israelites gave credit
to them: The people believed, as God had foretold ([Exo
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#018).md), knowing that no man could do
those works that they did, unless God were with him. They gave glory to
God: They bowed their heads and worshipped, therein expressing not only
their humble thankfulness to God, who had raised them up and sent them a
deliverer, but also their cheerful readiness to observe orders, and
pursue the methods of their deliverance.
