### [Deuteronomy Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 26:0</span></span>

With this chapter Moses concludes the particular statutes which he
thought fit to give Israel in charge at his parting with them; what
follows is by way of sanction and ratification. In this chapter, I.
Moses gives them a form of confession to be made by him that offered the
basket of his first-fruits ([Deu
26:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#001).md). II. The protestation and
prayer to be made after the disposal of the third year's tithe ([Deu
26:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012).md). III. He binds on all the
precepts he had given them, 1. By the divine authority: "Not I, but the
Lord thy God has commanded thee to do these statutes" ([Deu
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#016).md). 2. By the mutual covenant
between God and them ([Deu 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#017.md),
etc.).

[Deuteronomy 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 26:1</span></span>

Here is, I. A good work ordered to be done, and that is the presenting
of a basket of their first-fruits to God every year, [Deu
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#001.md), [Deu
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#002.md). Besides the sheaf of
first-fruits, which was offered for the whole land, on the morrow after
the passover ([Lev 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#010).md), every man
was to bring for himself a basket of first-fruits at the feast of
pentecost, when the harvest was ended, which is therefore called the
feast of first-fruits ([Exo 34:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#022).md),
and is said to be kept with a tribute of free-will-offering, [Deu
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#010.md). But the Jews say, "The
first-fruits, if not brought then, might be brought any time after,
between that and winter." When a man went into the field or vineyard at
the time when the fruits were ripening, he was to mark that which he
observed most forward, and to lay it by for first-fruits, wheat, barley,
grapes, figs, pomegranates, olives, and dates, some of each sort must be
put in the same basket, with leaves between them, and presented to God
in the place which he should choose. Now from this law we may learn, 1.
To acknowledge God as the giver of all those good things which are the
support and comfort of our natural life, and therefore to serve and
honour him with them. 2. To deny ourselves. What is first ripe we are
most fond of; those that are nice and curious expect to be served with
each fruit at its first coming in. My soul desired the first ripe
fruits, [Mic 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#001.md). When therefore God
appointed them to lay those by for him he taught them to prefer the
glorifying of his name before the gratifying of their own appetites and
desires. 3. To give to God the first and best we have, as those that
believe him to be the first and best of beings. Those that consecrate
the days of their youth, and the prime of their time, to the service and
honour of God, bring him their first-fruits, and with such offerings he
is well pleased. I remember the kindness of thy youth.

II\. Good words put into their mouths to be said in the doing of this
good work, as an explication of the meaning of this ceremony, that it
might be a reasonable service. The offerer must begin his acknowledgment
before he delivered his basket to the priest, and then must go on with
it, when the priest had set down the basket before the altar, as a
present to God their great landlord, [Deu
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#003.md), [Deu
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#004.md).

1\. He must begin with a receipt in full for the good land which God had
given them ([Deu 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#003).md): I profess that
I have come now at last, after forty years' wandering, unto the country
which the Lord swore to give us. This was most proper to be said when
they came first into Canaan; probably when they had been long settled
there they varied from this form. Note, When God has made good his
promises to us he expects that we should own it, to the honour of his
faithfulness; this is like giving up the bond, as Solomon does, [Kg1
8:56](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#056.md), There has not failed one word of
all his good promise. And our creature-comforts are doubly sweet to us
when we see them flowing from the fountain of the promise.

2\. He must remember and own the mean origin of that nation of which he
was a member. How great soever they were now, and he himself with them,
their beginning was very small, which ought thus to be kept in mind
throughout all the ages of their church by this public confession, that
they might not be proud of their privileges and advantages, but might
for ever be thankful to that God whose grace chose them when they were
so low and raised them so high. Two things they must own for this
purpose: - (1.) The meanness of their common ancestor: A Syrian ready to
perish was my father, [Deu 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#005.md). Jacob
is here called an Aramite, or Syrian, because he lived twenty years in
Padan-Aram; his wives were of that country, and his children were all
born there, except Benjamin; and perhaps the confessor means not Jacob
himself, but that son of Jacob who was the father of his tribe. However
it be, both father and sons were more than once ready to perish, by
Laban's severity, Esau's cruelty, and the famine in the land, which last
was the occasion of their going down into Egypt. Laban the Syrian sought
to destroy my father (so the Chaldee), had almost destroyed him, so the
Arabic. (2.) The miserable condition of their nation in its infancy.
They sojourned in Egypt as strangers, they served there as slaves ([Deu
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#006).md), and that a great while: as
their father was called a Syrian, they might be called Egyptians; so
that their possession of Canaan being so long discontinued they could
not pretend any tenant-right to it. A poor, despised, oppressed people
they were in Egypt, and therefore, though now rich and great, had no
reason to be proud, or secure, or forgetful of God.

3\. He must thankfully acknowledge God's great goodness, not only to
himself in particular, but to Israel in general. (1.) In bringing them
out of Egypt, [Deu 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#007.md), [Deu
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#008.md). It is spoken of here as an act
of pity - he looked on our affliction; and an act of power - he brought
us forth with a mighty hand. This was a great salvation, fit to be
remembered upon all occasions, and particularly upon this; they need not
grudge to bring a basket of first-fruits to God, for to him they owed it
that they were not now bringing in the tale of bricks to their cruel
task-masters. (2.) In settling them in Canaan: He hath given us this
land, [Deu 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#009.md). Observe, He must not
only give thanks for his own lot, but for the land in general which was
given to Israel; not only for this year's profits, but for the ground
itself which produced them, which God had graciously granted to his
ancestors and entailed upon his posterity. Note, The comfort we have in
particular enjoyments should lead us to be thankful for our share in
public peace and plenty; and with present mercies we should bless God
for the former mercies we remember and the further mercies we expect and
hope for.

4\. He must offer to God his basket of first-fruits ([Deu
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#010).md): "I have brought the
first-fruits of the land (like a pepper-corn) as a quit-rent for the
land which thou hast given me." Note, Whatever we give to God, it is but
of his own that we give him, [Ch1
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#014.md). And it becomes us, who receive
so much from him, to study what we shall render to him. The basket he
set before God; and the priests, as God's receivers, had the
first-fruits, as perquisites of their place and fees for attending, [Num
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#012.md).

III\. The offerer is here appointed, when he has finished the service,
1. To give glory to God: Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God. His
first-fruits were not accepted without further acts of adoration. A
humble, reverent, thankful heart is that which God looks at and
requires, and, without this, all we can put in a basket will not avail.
If a man would give all the substance of his house to be excused from
this, or in lieu of it, it would utterly be contemned. 2. To take the
comfort of it to himself and family: Thou shalt rejoice in every good
thing, [Deu 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#011.md). It is the will of
God that we should be cheerful, not only in our attendance upon his holy
ordinances, but in our enjoyments of the gifts of his providence.
Whatever good thing God gives us, it is his will that we should make the
most comfortable use we can of it, yet still tracing the streams to the
fountain of all comfort and consolation.

[Deuteronomy 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 26:12</span></span>

Concerning the disposal of their tithe the third year we had the law
before, [Deu 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#028.md), [Deu
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#029.md). The second tithe, which in the
other two years was to be spent in extraordinaries at the feasts, was to
be spent the third year at home, in entertaining the poor. Now because
this was done from under the eye of the priests, and a great confidence
was put in the people's honesty, that they would dispose of it according
to the law, to the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless ([Deu
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012).md), it is therefore required that
when at the next feast after they appeared before the Lord they should
there testify (as it were) upon oath, in a religious manner, that they
had fully administered, and been true to their trust.

I. They must make a solemn protestation to this purport, [Deu
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#013.md), [Deu
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#014.md). 1. That no hallowed things were
hoarded up: "I have brought them away out of my house, nothing now
remains there but my own part." 2. That the poor, and particularly poor
ministers, poor strangers, and poor widows, had had their part according
to the commandment. It is fit that God, who by his providence gives us
all we have, should by his law direct the using of it, and, though we
are not now under such particular appropriations of our revenue as they
then were, yet, in general, we are commanded to give alms of such things
as we have; and then, and not otherwise, all things are clean to us.
Then we may take the comfort of our enjoyments, when God has thus had
his dues out of them. This is a commandment which must not be
transgressed, no, not with an excuse of its being forgotten, [Deu
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#013.md). 3. That none of this tithe had
been misapplied to any common use, much less to any ill use. This seems
to refer to the tithe of the other two years, which was to be eaten by
the owners themselves; they must profess, (1.) That they had not eaten
of it in their mourning, when, by their mourning for the dead, they were
commonly unclean; or they had not eaten of it grudgingly, as those that
all their days eat in darkness. (2.) That they had not sacrilegiously
alienated it to any common use, for it was not their own. And, (3.) That
they had not given it for the dead, for the honour of their dead gods,
or in hope of making it beneficial to their dead friends. Now the
obliging of them to make this solemn protestation at the three years'
end would be an obligation upon them to deal faithfully, knowing that
they must be called upon thus to purge themselves. It is our wisdom to
keep conscience clear at all times, that when we come to give up our
account we may lift up our face without spot. The Jews say that this
protestation of their integrity was to be made with a low voice, because
it looked like a self-commendation, but that the foregoing confession of
God's goodness was to be made with a loud voice to his glory. He that
durst not make this protestation must bring his trespass-offering, [Lev
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#015.md).

II\. To this solemn protestation they must add a solemn prayer ([Deu
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#015).md), not particularly for
themselves, but for God's people Israel; for in the common peace and
prosperity every particular person prospers and has peace. We must learn
hence to be public-spirited in prayer, and to wrestle with God for
blessings for the land and nation, our English Israel, and for the
universal church, which we are directed to have an eye to in our
prayers, as the Israel of God, [Gal
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016.md). In this prayer we are taught, 1.
To look up to God as in a holy habitation, and thence to infer that
holiness becomes his house, and that he will be sanctified in those that
are about him. 2. To depend upon the favour of God, and his gracious
cognizance, as sufficient to make us and our people happy. 3. To reckon
it wonderful condescension in God to case an eye even upon so great and
honourable a body as Israel was. It is looking down. 4. To be earnest
with God for a blessing upon his people Israel, and upon the land which
he has given us. For how should the earth yield its increase, or, if it
does, what comfort can we take in it, unless therewith God, even our own
God, gives us his blessing? [Psa 67:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#006.md).

[Deuteronomy 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 26:16</span></span>

Two things Moses here urges to enforce all these precepts: - 1. That
they were the commands of God, [Deu
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#016.md). They were not the dictates of
his own wisdom, nor were they enacted by any authority of his own, but
infinite wisdom framed them, and the power of the King of kings made
them binding to them: "The Lord thy God commands thee, therefore thou
art bound in duty and gratitude to obey him, and it is at thy peril if
thou disobey. They are his laws, therefore thou shalt do them, for to
that end were they given thee: do them and not dispute them, do them and
not draw back from them; do them not carelessly and hypocritically, but
with thy heart and soul, thy whole heart and thy whole soul." 2. That
their covenant with God obliged them to keep these commands. He insists
not only upon God's sovereignty over them, but his propriety in them,
and the relation wherein they stood to him. The covenant is mutual, and
it binds to obedience both ways. (1.) That we may perform our part of
the covenant, and answer the intentions of that ([Deu
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#017).md): "Thou hast avouched and
solemnly owned and confessed the Lord Jehovah to be thy God, thy Prince
and Ruler. As he is so by an incontestable right, so he is by thy own
consent." They did this implicitly by their attendance on his word, had
done it expressly (Ex. 24), and were now to do it again before they
parted, [Deu 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#001.md). Now this obliges
us, in fidelity to our word, as well as in duty to our Sovereign, to
keep his statutes and his commandments. We really forswear ourselves,
and perfidiously violate the most sacred engagements, if, when we have
taken the Lord to be our God, we do not make conscience of obeying his
commands. (2.) That God's part of the covenant also may be made good,
and the intentions of that answered ([Deu
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#018.md), [Deu
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#019).md): The Lord has avouched, not
only taken, but publicly owned thee to be his segullah, his peculiar
people, as he has promised thee, that is, according to the true intent
and meaning of the promise. Now their obedience was not only the
condition of this favour, and of the continuance of it (if they were not
obedient, God would disown them, and cast them off), but it was also the
principal design of this favour. "He has avouched thee on purpose that
thou shouldest keep his commandments, that thou mightest have both the
best directions and the best encouragements in religion." Thus we are
elected to obedience ([Pe1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002).md),
chosen that we should be holy ([Eph
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004).md), purified, a peculiar people,
that we might not only do good works, but be zealous in them, [Tit
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014.md). Two things God is here said to
design in avouching them to be his peculiar people ([Deu
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#019).md), to make them high, and, in
order to that, to make them holy; for holiness is true honour, and the
only way to everlasting honour. \[1.\] To make them high above all
nations. The greatest honour we are capable of in this world is to be
taken into covenant with God, and to live in his service. They should
be, First, High in praise; for God would accept them, which is true
praise, [Rom 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029.md). Their friends would
admire them, [Zep 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#019.md), [Zep
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#020.md). Secondly, High in name, which,
some think, denotes the continuance and perpetuity of that praise, a
name that shall not be cut off. Thirdly, High in honour, that is, in all
the advantages of wealth and power, which would make them great above
their neighbours. See [Jer 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#011.md).
\[2.\] That they might be a holy people, separated for God, devoted to
him, and employed continually in his service. This God aimed at in
taking them to be his people; so that, if they did not keep his
commandments, they received all this grace in vain.
