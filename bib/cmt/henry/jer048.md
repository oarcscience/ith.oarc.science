### [Jeremiah Chapter 48](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 48:0</span></span>

Moab is next set to the bar before Jeremiah the prophet, whom God has
constituted judge over nations and kingdoms, from his mouth to receive
its doom. Isaiah's predictions concerning Moab had had their
accomplishment (we had the predictions [Isa
15:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001.md) and [Isa
16:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001.md) and the like [Amo
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#001).md), and they were fulfilled when the
Assyrians, under Salmanassar, invaded and distressed Moab. But this is a
prophecy of the desolations of Moab by the Chaldeans, which were
accomplished under Nebuzaradan, about five years after he had destroyed
Jerusalem. Here is, I. The destruction foretold, that it should be great
and general, should extend itself to all parts of the country ([Jer
48:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#001.md), [Jer
48:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#008.md), and again [Jer
48:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#021.md), [Jer
48:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#034).md), that spoilers should come upon
them and force some to flee ([Jer
48:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#009).md), should carry many into
captivity ([Jer 48:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#012.md), [Jer
48:46](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#046).md), that the enemy should come
shortly ([Jer 48:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#016).md), come swiftly and
surprise them ([Jer 48:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#040.md), [Jer
48:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#041).md), that he should make thorough
work ([Jer 48:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#010).md) and lay the country
quite waste, though it was very strong ([Jer
48:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#014.md), [Jer
48:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#015).md), that there should be no
escaping ([Jer 48:42](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#042.md), [Jer
48:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#045).md), that this should force them to
quit their idols ([Jer 48:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#013.md), [Jer
48:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#035).md) and put an end to all their joy
([Jer 48:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#033.md), [Jer
48:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#034).md), that their neighbours shall
lament them ([Jer 48:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#017).md) and the
prophet himself does ([Jer 48:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#031.md), [Jer
48:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#036), etc..md). II. The causes of this
destruction assigned; it was sin that brought this ruin upon them, their
pride, and security, and carnal confidence ([Jer
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#007.md), [Jer
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#011.md), [Jer
48:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#014.md), [Jer
48:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#029).md), and their contempt of and
enmity to God and his people ([Jer
48:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#026.md), [Jer
48:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#027.md), [Jer
48:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#030).md). III. A promise of the
restoration of Moab (v. 48).

[Jeremiah 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 48:1</span></span>

We may observe in these verses,

I. The author of Moab's destruction; it is the Lord of hosts, that has
armies, all armies, at his command, and the God of Israel ([Jer
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#001).md), who will herein plead the cause
of his Israel against a people that have always been vexatious to them,
and will punish them now for the injuries done to Israel of old, though
Israel was forbidden to meddle with them ([Deu
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009).md), therefore the destruction of
Moab is called the work of the Lord ([Jer
48:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#010).md), for it is he that pleads for
Israel; and his work will exactly agree with his word, [Jer
48:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#008.md).

II\. The instruments of it: Spoilers shall come ([Jer
48:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#008).md), shall come with a sword, a
sword that shall pursue them, [Jer
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#002.md). "I will send unto him wanderers,
such as come from afar, as if they were vagrants, or had missed their
way, but they shall cause him to wander; they seem as wanderers
themselves, but they shall make the Moabites to be really wanderers,
some to flee and others to be carried into captivity." These destroyers
stir up themselves to do execution; they have devised evil against
Heshbon, one of the principal cities of Moab, and they aim at no less
than the ruin of the kingdom: Come, and let us cut it off from being a
nation ([Jer 48:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#002).md); nothing less will
serve the turn of the invaders; they come, not to plunder it, but to
ruin it. The prophet, in God's name, engages them to make thorough work
of it ([Jer 48:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#010).md): Cursed be he that
does the work of the Lord deceitfully, this bloody work, this destroying
work; though it goes against the grain with men of compassion, yet it is
the work of the Lord, and must not be done by the halves. The Chaldeans
have it in charge, by a secret instinct (says Mr. Gataker), to destroy
the Moabites, and therefore they must not spare, must not, out of
foolish pity, keep back their sword from blood; they would thereby bring
a sword, and a curse with it, upon themselves, as Saul did by sparing
the Amalekites and Ahab by letting Benhadad go. Thy life shall go for
his life. To this work is applied that general rule given to all that
are employed in any service for God, Cursed by he that does the work of
the Lord deceitfully or negligently, that pretends to do it, but does it
not to purpose, makes a show of serving God's glory, but is really
serving his own ends and carries on the work of the Lord no further than
will suit his own purposes, or that is slothful in business for God and
takes neither care nor pains to do it as it should be done, [Mal
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#014.md). Let not such deceive themselves,
for God will not thus be mocked.

III\. The woeful instances and effects of this destruction. The cities
shall be laid in ruins; they shall be spoiled ([Jer
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#001).md) and cut down ([Jer
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#002).md); they shall be desolate ([Jer
48:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#009).md), without any to dwell therein;
there shall be no houses to dwell in, or no people to dwell in them, or
no safety and ease to those that would dwell in them. Every city shall
be spoiled and no city shall escape. The strongest city shall not be
able to secure itself against the enemies' power, nor shall the finest
city be able to recommend itself to the enemies' pity and favour. The
country also shall be wasted, the valley shall perish, and the plain be
destroyed, [Jer 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#008.md). The corn and the
flocks, which used to cover the plains and make the valleys rejoice,
shall all be destroyed, eaten up, trodden down, or carried off. The most
sacred persons shall not escape: The priests and princes shall go
together into captivity. Nay, Chemosh, the god they worship, who, they
hope, will protect them, shall share with them in the ruin; his temples
shall be laid in ashes and his image carried away with the rest of the
spoil. Now the consequence of all this will be, 1. Great shame and
confusion: Kirjathaim is confounded, and Misgah is so. They shall be
ashamed of the mighty boasts they have sometimes made of their cities:
There shall be no more vaunting in Moab concerning Heshbon (so it might
be read, [Jer 48:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#002).md); they shall no
more boast of the strength of that city when the evil which is designed
against it is brought upon it. Nor shall they any more boast of their
gods ([Jer 48:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#013).md); they shall be
ashamed of Chemosh (ashamed of all the prayers they have made to and all
the confidence they put in that dunghill deity), as Israel was ashamed
of Beth-el, of the golden calf they had at Beth-el, which they confided
in as their protector, but were deceived in, for it was not able to save
them from the Assyrians; nor shall Chemosh be able to save the Moabites
from the Chaldeans. Note, Those that will not be convinced and made
ashamed of the folly of their idolatry by the word of God shall be
convinced and made ashamed of it by the judgments of God, when they
shall find by woeful experience the utter inability of the gods they
have served to do them any service. 2. There will be great sorrow; there
is a voice of crying heard ([Jer 48:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#003).md)
and the cry is nothing but spoiling and great destruction. Alas! alas!
Moab is destroyed, [Jer 48:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#004.md). The
great ones having quitted the cities to shift for their own safety, even
the little ones have caused a cry to be heard, the meaner sort of
people, or the little children, the innocent harmless ones, whose cries
at such a time are the most piteous. Go up to the hills, go down to the
valleys, and you meet with continual weeping (weeping with weeping); all
are in tears; you meet none with dry eyes. Even the enemies have heard
the cry, from whom it would have been policy to conceal it, for they
will be animated and encouraged by it; but it is so great that it cannot
be hid, 3. There will be great hurry; they will cry to one another,
"Away, away! flee; save your lives ([Jer
48:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#006).md); shift for your own safety with
all imaginable speed, though you escape as bare and naked as the heath,
or grig, or dry shrub, in the wilderness; think not of carrying away any
thing you have, for it may cost you your life to attempt it, [Mat
24:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#016.md). Take shelter, though it be
in a barren wilderness, that you may have your lives for a prey. The
danger will come suddenly and swiftly; and therefore give wings unto
Moab ([Jer 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#009).md); that would be the
greatest kindness you could do them; that is what they will call for, O
that we had wings like a dove! for unless they have wings, and can fly,
there will be no escaping."

IV\. The sins for which God will now reckon with Moab, and which justify
God in these severe proceedings against them. 1. It is because they have
been secure, and have trusted in their wealth and strength, in their
works and in their treasures, [Jer
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#007.md). They had taken a great deal of
pains to fortify their cities and make large works about them, and to
fill their exchequer and private coffers, so that they thought
themselves in as good a posture for war as any people could be and that
none durst invade them, and therefore set danger at defiance. They
trusted in the abundance of their riches and strengthened themselves in
their wickedness, [Psa 52:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#007.md). Now, for
this reason, that they may have a sensible conviction of the vanity and
folly of their carnal confidences, God will send an enemy that will
master their works and rifle their treasures. Note, We forfeit the
comfort of that creature which we repose that confidence in which should
be reposed in God only. The reed will break that is leaned upon. 2. It
is because they have not made a right improvement of the days of the
peace and prosperity, [Jer 48:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#011). (1..md)
They had been long undisturbed: Moab has been at ease from his youth. It
was an ancient kingdom before Israel was, and had enjoyed great
tranquillity, though a small country and surrounded with potent
neighbours. God's Israel were afflicted from their youth ([Psa
129:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001.md), [Psa
129:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#002).md), but Moab at ease from his
youth. He has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, has not known any
troublesome weakening changes, but is as wine kept on the lees, and not
racked or drawn off, by which it retains its strength and body. He has
not been unsettled, nor any way made uneasy; he has not gone into
captivity, as Israel have often done, and yet Moab is a wicked
idolatrous nation, and one of the confederates against God's hidden
ones, [Psa 83:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#003.md), [Psa
83:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#006.md). Note, There are many that
persist in unrepented iniquity and yet enjoy uninterrupted prosperity.
(2.) They had been as long corrupt and unreformed: He has settled on his
lees; he has been secure and sensual in his prosperity, has rested in
it, and fetched all the strength and life of the soul from it, as the
wine from the lees. His taste remained in him, and his scent is not
changed; he is still the same, as bad as ever he was. Note, While bad
people are as happy as they used to be in the world it is no marvel if
they are bad as they used to be. They have no changes of their peace and
prosperity, therefore fear not God, their hearts and lives are
unchanged, [Psa 55:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019.md).

[Jeremiah 48:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 48:14</span></span>

The destruction is here further prophesied of very largely and with a
great copiousness and variety of expression, and very pathetically and
in moving language, designed not only to awaken them by a national
repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal
repentance and reformation to prepare for it, but to affect us with the
calamitous state of human life, which is liable to such lamentable
occurrences, and with the power of God's anger and the terror of his
judgments, when he comes forth to contend with a provoking people. In
reading this long roll of threatenings, and meditating on the terror of
them, it will be of more use to us to keep this in our eye, and to get
our hearts thereby possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath,
than to enquire critically into all the lively figures and metaphors
here used.

I. It is a surprising destruction, and very sudden, that is here
threatened. They were very secure, thought themselves strong for war and
able to deal with the most powerful enemy ([Jer
48:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#014).md), and yet the calamity is near,
and he is not able to keep it off, nor so much as to keep the enemy long
in parley, for the affliction hastens fast ([Jer
48:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#016).md) and will soon come to a crisis.
The enemy shall fly as an eagle, so swiftly, so strongly shall he come
([Jer 48:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#040).md), as an eagle flies upon
his prey, and he shall spread his wings, the wings of his army, over
Moab; he shall surround it, that none may escape. The strong-holds of
Moab are taken by surprise ([Jer
48:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#041).md), so that all their strength
stood them in no stead; and this made the hearts even of their mighty
men to fail, for they had not time to recollect the considerations that
might have animated them. It requires a more than ordinary degree of
courage not to be afraid of sudden fear.

II\. It is an utter destruction, and such as lays Moab all in ruins:
Moab is spoiled ([Jer 48:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#015).md), quite
spoiled, is confounded and broken down ([Jer
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#020).md); their cities are laid in
ashes, or seized by the enemy so that they are forced to quit them, [Jer
48:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#015.md). Divers cities are here named,
upon which judgment has come, and the list concludes with an et cetera -
and such like. What occasion was there for him to mention more
particulars when it comes upon all the cities of Moab in general, far
and near? [Jer 48:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#021.md). Note, When
iniquity is universal we have reason to expect that calamity should be
so too. The kingdom is deprived of its dignity and authority: The horn
of Moab is cut off, the horn of its strength and power, both offensive
and defensive; his arm is broken, that he can neither give a blow nor
prevent a blow, [Jer 48:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#025.md). Is the
youth of the kingdom the strength and beauty of it? His chosen young men
have gone down to the slaughter, [Jer
48:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#015.md). They went down to the battle
promising themselves that they should return victorious; but God told
them that they went down to the slaughter; so sure are those to fall
against whom God fights. In a word, Moab shall be destroyed from being a
people, [Jer 48:42](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#042.md). Those that are
enemies to God's people will soon be made no people.

III\. It is a lamentable destruction; it will be just matter of mourning
and will turn joy into heaviness. 1. The prophet that foretels it does
himself lament it, and mourns at the very foresight of it, from a
principle of compassion to his fellow-creatures and concern for human
nature. The prophet will himself howl for Moab; his very heart shall
mourn for them ([Jer 48:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#031).md); he will
weep for the vine of Sibmah ([Jer
48:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#032).md); his heart shall sound like
pipes for Moab, [Jer 48:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#036.md). Though the
destruction of Moab would prove him a true prophet, yet he could not
think of it without trouble. The ruin of sinners is no pleasure to God,
and therefore should be a pain to us; even those that give warning of it
should lay it to heart. These passages, and many others in this chapter,
are much the same with what Isaiah had used in his prophecies against
Moab ([Isa 15:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001.md), [Isa
16:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001).md); for, though there was a long
distance of time between that prophecy and this, yet they were both
dictated by one and the same Spirit, and it becomes God's prophets to
speak the language of those that went before them. It is no plagiarism
sometimes to make use of old expressions, provided it be with new
affections and applications. 2. The Moabites themselves shall lament it;
it will be the greatest mortification and grief imaginable to them.
Those that sat in glory, in the midst of wealth, and mirth, and all
manner of pleasure, shall sit in thirst, in a dry and thirsty land,
where no water, no comfort is, [Jer
48:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#018.md). It is time for them to sit in
thirst, and inure themselves to hardship, when the spoiler has come, who
will strip them of all, and empty them. The Moabites in the remote
corners of the country, that are furthest from the danger, will be
inquisitive to know how the matter goes, what news from the army, will
ask every one that escapes, What is done? [Jer
48:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#019.md). And when they are told that all
is gone, that the invader is the conqueror, they will howl and cry, in
bitterness and anguish of spirit ([Jer
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#020).md); they will abandon themselves
to solitude, to lament the desolations of their country; they will leave
the cities that used to be full of mirth, and dwell in the rock where
they may have their full of melancholy; they shall no more be singing
birds, but mourning birds, like the dove ([Jer
48:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#028).md); the doves of the valley, [Eze
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#016.md). Let those that give themselves
up to mirth know that God can soon change their note. Their sorrow shall
be so very extreme that they shall make themselves bald and cut
themselves ([Jer 48:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#037).md), which were
expressions of a desperate grief, such as tempted men to be even their
own destroyers. Job indeed rent his mantle and shaved his head, but he
did not cut himself. When the flood of passion rises ever so high wisdom
and grace must set bounds to it, set banks to it, to restrain it from
such barbarities. The sorrow shall be universal ([Jer
48:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#038).md): There shall be a general
lamentation upon all the house-tops of Moab, where they worshipped their
idols, to whom they shall in vain bemoan themselves, and in all the
streets, where they conversed with one another, for they shall be free
in communicating their grief and fears and in propagating them; for they
see all lost: "I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure,
which shall not be regarded and cannot be pieced again." That which Moab
used to rejoice in was their pleasant fruits and the abundance of their
rich wines. The delights of sense were all the matter of their joy. Take
away these, destroy their gardens and vineyards, and you make all their
mirth to cease, [Hos 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#011.md), [Hos
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#012.md). There is great weeping when
their plants are transplanted, have gone over the sea ([Jer
48:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#032).md), are carried into other
countries, to be planted there. The spoiler has fallen upon thy
summer-fruits and upon thy vintage, and it is this that makes the cry of
Heshbon to reach even to Elealeh, [Jer
48:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#034.md). Take joy and gladness from the
plentiful field, and you take it from the land of Moab, [Jer
48:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#033.md). If the wine fail from the
wine-presses, that used to be trodden with acclamations of joy, all
their gladness is cut off. Take away that shouting, and there shall be
no shouting. Note, Those who make the delights of sense their chief joy,
their exceeding joy, since these are things they may easily be deprived
of in a little time subject themselves to the tyranny of the greatest
grief; whereas those who rejoice in God may do that even when the
fig-tree does not blossom and there is no fruit in the vine. These
Moabites lost not only their wine, but their water too: Even the waters
of Nimrim shall be desolate ([Jer
48:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#034).md), and therefore their grief grew
extravagantly loud and noisy, and their lamentations were heard in all
placed like the lowing of a heifer of three years old. The expressions
here are borrowed from [Isa 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005.md), [Isa
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#006.md). 3. All their neighbours are
called to mourn with them, and to condole with them on their ruin ([Jer
48:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#017).md): All you that are about him
bemoan him, Let him have that allay to his grief, let him see himself
pities by the adjoining countries. Nay, let those at a distance, who do
but know his name and have heard of his reputation, take notice of his
fall, and say, How is the strong staff broken, whose strength was the
terror of its enemies, and the beautiful rod, whose beauty was the pride
of its friends! Let the nations take notice of this and receive
instruction. Let none be puffed up with or put confidence in their
strength or beauty, for neither will be a security against the judgments
of God.

IV\. It is a shameful destruction and such as shall expose them to
contempt: Moab is made drunk ([Jer
48:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#026).md), and he that is made drunk is
made vile; he shall wallow in his vomit, and become an odious spectacle,
and shalljustly be in derision. Let the Moabites be intoxicated with the
cup of God's wrath till they stagger and fall, and be brought to their
wits' end, and make themselves ridiculous by the wildness not only of
their passions but of their counsels. And again ([Jer
48:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#039).md): Moab shall be a derision and a
dismaying to all about him; they shall laugh at the fall of the pomp and
power he was so proud of. Note, Those that are haughty are preparing
reproach and ignominy for themselves.

V. It is the destruction of that which is dear to them, not only of
their summer fruits and their vintage, but of their wealth ([Jer
48:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#036).md): The riches that he has gotten
have perished, though he thought he had laid them up very safely, and
promised himself a long enjoyment of them, yet they are gone. Note, The
money that is hoarded in the chest is as liable to perishing as the
summer-fruits that lie exposed in the open field. Riches are shedding
things, and, like dust as they are, slip through our fingers even when
we are in most care to hold them fast and gripe them hard. Yet this is
not the worst; even those whose religion was false and foolish were fond
of it above any thing, and, such as it was, would not part with it; and
therefore, though it was really a promise, yet to them it was a
threatening ([Jer 48:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#035).md), that God
will cause to cease him that offers in the high places, for the high
places shall be destroyed, and the fields of offerings shall be laid
waste, and the priests themselves, who burnt incense to their gods,
shall be slain or carried into captivity, [Jer
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#007.md). Note, It is only the true
religion, and the worship and service of the true God, that will stand
us in stead in a day of trouble.

VI\. It is a just and righteous destruction, and that which they have
deserved and brought upon themselves by sin.

1\. The sin which they had been most notoriously guilty of, and for
which God now reckoned with them, was pride. It is mentioned six times,
[Jer 48:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#029.md). We have all heard of the
pride of Moab; his neighbours took notice of it; it has testified to his
face, as Israel's did; he is exceedingly proud, and grows worse and
worse. Observe his loftiness, his arrogancy, his pride, his haughtiness;
the multiplying of words to the same purport intimates in how many
instances he discovered his pride, and how offensive it was both to God
and man. It was charged upon them Isa, [Jer
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#006.md), but here it is expressed more
largely that there. Since then they had been under humbling providences,
and yet were unhumbled; nay, they grew more arrogant and haughty, which
plainly marked them for that utter destruction of which pride is the
forerunner. Two instances are here given of the pride of Moab: - (1.) He
had conducted himself insolently towards God. He must be brought down
with shame ([Jer 48:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#026).md), for he has
magnified himself against the Lord; and again ([Jer
48:42](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#042).md), he shall be destroyed from
being a people, for this very reason. The Moabites preferred Chemosh
before Jehovah, and thought themselves a match for the God of Israel,
whom they set at defiance. (2.) He had conducted himself scornfully
towards Israel, particularly in their late troubles; therefore Moab
shall fall into the same troubles; into the same hands, and be a
derision, for Israel was a derision to him, [Jer
48:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#026.md), [Jer
48:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#027.md). The generality of the Moabites,
when they heard of the calamities and desolations of their neighbours
the Jews, instead of lamenting them, rejoiced in them, they skipped for
joy. Many, in such a case, entertain in their minds a secret pleasure at
the fall of those they had a dislike to, who yet have so much discretion
as to conceal it; it is so invidious a thing. But the Moabites
industriously proclaimed their joy, and avowed the enmity they had to
Israel, triumphing over every Israelite they met with in distress and
laughing at him, which was as inhuman as it was impious and an impudent
affront both to man, whose nature they were of, and to God, whose name
they were called by. Note, Those that deride others in distress will
justly and certainly, sooner or later, come into distress themselves,
and be had in derision. Those that are glad at calamities, especially
the calamities of God's church, shall not long go unpunished.

2\. Besides this they had been guilty of malice against God's people,
and treachery in their dealings with them, [Jer
48:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#030.md). They made a jest of the
desolations of Judah and Jerusalem, and pretended, when they laughed at
them, that it was but in sport and to make themselves merry; but, says
God, "I know his wrath; I know it comes from the old enmity he has to
the seed of Abraham and the worshippers of the true God. I know he
thinks these calamities of the Jewish nation will end in their utter
extirpation. He now tells the Chaldeans what bad people the Jews are,
and irritates them against them; but it shall not be so as he expects;
his lies shall not so effect it. The nation, whose fall they triumph in,
shall recover itself." Some read it, I know his rage. Is it not so? Is
he not very furious against the people of God? And his lies I know also.
Do they not do so? Do they not belie them? Note, All the fury and all
the falsehood of the church's enemies are perfectly known to God,
whatever the pretenses are with which they think to cover them, [Isa
37:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#028.md).

VII\. It is a complicated destruction, and by one instance after another
will at length be completed; for those that make their escape from one
judgment shall perish by another: Fear, and the pit, and the snare,
shall be upon them, [Jer 48:43](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#043.md). There
shall be fear to drive them into the pit, and a snare to hold them fast
in it when they are in it; so that they shall neither escape from the
destruction nor escape out of it. What was said of sinners in general
([Isa 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#017.md), [Isa
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#018).md), that those who flee from the
fear shall fall into the pit and those who come up out of the pit shall
be taken in the snare, is here particularly foretold concerning the
sinners of Moab ([Jer 48:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#044).md); for it
is the year of their visitation, when God comes to reckon with them, and
will be known by the judgments which he executes, for he is the King
whose name is the Lord of hosts ([Jer
48:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#015).md); he is not only the King who
has authority to give judgment, but he is the Lord of hosts, who is able
to do what he has determined. The figurative expressions used [Jer
48:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#044.md) are explained in one instance
([Jer 48:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#045).md): Those that fled out of
the villages for fear of the enemy's forces put themselves under the
shadow of Heshbon, stood there, and supposed they stood safely, as now
armies sometimes retire under the cannon of a fortified city, and it is
their protection; but here they should be disappointed, for, when they
flee out of the pit, they fall into the snare; Heshbon, which they
thought would shelter them, devours them as Moses had foretold long
since ([Num 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#028).md): A fire has gone
out of Heshbon, and a flame from the city of Sihon, and devours those
that come from all the corners of Moab, and fastens upon the crown of
the head of the tumultuous noisy ones, or of the revellers, or children
of noise, not meant of the rude clamorous multitude, but of the great
men, who bluster, and hector, and make a noise; the judgments of God
shall light on them. Shall we hear the conclusion of this whole matter?
We have it ([Jer 48:46](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#046).md): "Woe be to
thee, O Moab! thou art undone; the people that worship Chemosh perish,
and are gone; farewell, Moab. Thy sons and daughters, the hopes of the
next generation, have gone into captivity after the Jews, whose
calamities they rejoiced in."

VIII\. Yet it is not a perpetual destruction. The chapter concludes with
a short promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days.
God, who brings them into captivity, will bring again their captivity,
[Jer 48:47](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#047.md). Thus tenderly does God
deal with Moabites, much more with his own people! Even with Moabites he
will not contend for ever, nor be always wrath. When Israel returned,
Moab did; and perhaps the prophecy was intended chiefly for the
encouragement of God's people to hope for that salvation which even
Moabites shall share in. Yet it looks further, to gospel times; the Jews
themselves refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captivity of
the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by
divine grace, which shall make them free, free indeed. This prophecy
concerning Moab is long, but here it ends; it ends comfortably: Thus far
is the judgment of Moab.
