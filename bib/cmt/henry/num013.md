### [Numbers Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 13:0</span></span>

It is a memorable and very melancholy story which is related in this and
the following chapter, of the turning back of Israel from the borders of
Canaan, when they were just ready to set foot in it, and the sentencing
of them to wander and perish in the wilderness for their unbelief and
murmuring. It is referred to [Psa
95:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007.md), etc., and improved for warning
to Christians, [Heb 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#007.md), etc. In this
chapter we have, I. The sending of twelve spies before them into Canaan
(v. 1-16). II. The instructions given to these spies ([Num
13:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#017).md). III. Their executing their
commission according to their instructions, and their return from the
search ([Num 13:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021).md). IV. The report
they brought back to the camp of Israel ([Num
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#026), etc..md).

[Numbers 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 13:1</span></span>

Here we have, I. Orders given to send spies to search out the land of
Canaan. It is here said, God directed Moses to send them ([Num
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#001.md), [Num
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#002).md), but it appears by the
repetition of the story afterwards ([Deu
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#022).md) that the motion came originally
from the people; they came to Moses, and said, We will send men before
us; and it was the fruit of their unbelief. They would not take God's
word that it was a good land, and that he would, without fail, put them
in possession of it. They could not trust the pillar of cloud and fire
to show them the way to it, but had a better opinion of their own
politics than of God's wisdom. How absurd was it for them to send to spy
out a land which God himself had spied out for them, to enquire the way
into it when God himself had undertaken to show them the way! But thus
we ruin ourselves by giving more credit to the reports and
representations of sense than to divine revelation; we walk by sight,
not by faith; whereas, if we will receive the witness of men, without
doubt the witness of God is greater. The people making this motion to
Moses, he (perhaps not aware of the unbelief at the bottom of it)
consulted God in the case, who bade him gratify the people in this
matter, and send spies before them: "Let them walk in their own
counsels." Yet God was no way accessory to the sin that followed, for
the sending of these spies was so far from being the cause of the sin
that if the spies had done their duty, and the people theirs, it might
have been the confirmation of their faith, and of good service to them.

II\. The persons nominated that were to be employed in this service
([Num 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#004), etc..md), one of each tribe,
that it might appear to be the act of the people in general; and rulers,
person of figure in their respective tribes, some of the rulers of
thousands or hundreds, to put the greater credit upon their embassy.
This was designed for the best, but it proved to have this ill effect
that the quality of the persons occasioned the evil report they brought
up to be the more credited and the people to be the more influenced by
it. Some think that they are all named for the sake of two good ones
that were among them, Caleb and Joshua. Notice is taken of the change of
Joshua's name upon this occasion, [Num
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#016.md). He was Moses's minister, but
had been employed, though of the tribe of Ephraim, as general of the
forces that were sent out against Amalek. The name by which he was
generally called and known in his own tribe was Oshea, but Moses called
him Joshua, in token of his affection to him and power over him; and
now, it should seem, he ordered others to call him so, and fixed that to
be his name henceforward. Oshea signifies a prayer for salvation, Save
thou; Joshua signifies a promise of salvation, He will save, in answer
to that prayer: so near is the relation between prayers and promises.
Prayers prevail for promises, and promises direct and encourage prayers.
Some think that Moses designed, by taking the first syllable of the name
Jehovah and prefixing it to his name, which turned Hoshea into Jehoshua,
to put an honour upon him, and to encourage him in this and all his
future services with the assurances of God's presence. Yet after this he
is called Hoshea, [Deu 32:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#044.md). Jesus is
the same name with Joshua, and it is the name of our Lord Christ, of
whom Joshua was a type as successor to Moses, Israel's captain, and
conqueror of Canaan. There was another of the same name, who was also a
type of Christ, [Zac 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#011.md). Joshua was
the saviour of God's people from the powers of Canaan, but Christ is
their Saviour from the powers of hell.

III\. The instructions given to those spies. They were sent into the
land of Canaan the nearest way, to traverse the country, and to take
account of its present state, [Num
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#017.md). Two heads of enquiry were given
them in charge, 1. Concerning the land itself: See what that is ([Num
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#018.md), and again, [Num
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#019).md), see whether it be good or bad,
and ([Num 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#020).md) whether it be fat or
lean. All parts of the earth do not share alike in the blessing of
fruitfulness; some countries are blessed with a richer soil than others.
Moses himself was well satisfied that Canaan was a very good land, but
he sent these spies to bring an account of it for the satisfaction of
the people; as John Baptist sent to Jesus, to ask whether he was the
Christ, not to inform himself, but to inform those he sent. They must
take notice whether the air was healthful or no, what the soil was, and
what the productions; and, for the better satisfaction of the people,
they must bring with them some of the fruits. 2. Concerning the
inhabitants - their number, few or many - their size and stature,
whether strong able-bodied men or weak, - their habitations, whether
they lived in tents or houses, whether in open villages or in walled
towns, - whether the woods were standing as in those countries that are
uncultivated, through the unskillfulness and slothfulness of the
inhabitants, or whether the woods were cut down, and the country made
champaign, for the convenience of tillage. These were the things they
were to enquire about. Perhaps there had not been of late years such
commerce between Egypt and Canaan as there was in Jacob's time, else
they might have informed themselves of these things without sending men
on purpose to search. See the advantage we may derive from books and
learning, which acquaint those that are curious and inquisitive with the
state of foreign countries, at a much greater distance than Canaan was
now from Israel, without this trouble and expense.

IV\. Moses dismisses the spies with this charge, Be of good courage,
intimating, not only that they should be themselves encouraged against
the difficulties of this expedition, but that they should bring an
encouraging account to the people and make the best of every thing. It
was not only a great undertaking they were put upon, which required good
management and resolution, but it was a great trust that was reposed in
them, which required that they should be faithful.

[Numbers 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 13:21</span></span>

We have here a short account of the survey which the spies made of the
promised land. 1. They went quite through it, from Zin in the south, to
Rehob, near Hamath, in the north, [Num
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021.md). See [Num
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#003.md), [Num
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#008.md). It is probable that they did not
go altogether in a body, lest they should be suspected and taken up,
which there would be the more danger of if the Canaanites knew (and one
would think they could not but know) how near the Israelites were to
them; but they divided themselves into several companies, and so passed
unsuspected, as way-faring men. 2. They took particular notice of Hebron
([Num 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022).md), probably because near
there was the field of Machpelah, where the patriarchs were buried ([Gen
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#002).md), whose dead bodies did, as it
were, keep possession of that land for their posterity. To this
sepulchre they made a particular visit, and found the adjoining city in
the possession of the sons of Anak, who are here named. In that place
where they expected the greatest encouragements they met with the
greatest discouragements. Where the bodies of their ancestors kept
possession for them the giants kept possession against them. They
ascended by the south, and came to Hebron, that is, "Caleb," say the
Jews, "in particular," for to his being there we find express reference,
[Jos 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#009.md), [Jos
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#012.md), [Jos
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#013.md). But that others of the spies
were there too appears by their description of the Anakim, v. 33. 3.
They brought a bunch of grapes with them, and some other of the fruits
of the land, as a proof of the extraordinary goodness of the country.
Probably they furnished themselves with these fruits when they were
leaving the country and returning. The cluster of grapes was so large
and so heavy that they hung it upon a bar, and carried it between two of
them, [Num 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#023.md), [Num
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#024.md). The place whence they took it
was, from this circumstance, called the valley of the cluster, that
famous cluster which was to Israel both the earnest and the specimen of
all the fruits of Canaan. Such are the present comforts which we have in
communion with God, foretastes of the fulness of joy we expect in the
heavenly Canaan. We may see by them what heaven is.

[Numbers 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">num 13:26</span></span>

It is a wonder how the people of Israel had patience to stay forty days
for the return of their spies, when they were just ready to enter
Canaan, under all the assurances of success they could have from the
divine power, and a constant series of miracles that had hitherto
attended them; but they distrusted God's power and promise, and were
willing to be held in suspense by their own counsels, rather than be
brought to a certainty by God's covenant. How much do we stand in our
own light by our unbelief! Well, at length the messengers return, but
they agree not in their report.

I. The major part discourage the people from going forward to Canaan;
and justly are the Israelites left to this temptation, for putting so
much confidence in the judgment of men, when they had the word of God to
trust to. It is a righteous thing with God to give those up to strong
delusions who will not receive his truth in the love of it.

1\. Observe their report. (1.) They could not deny but that the land of
Canaan was a very fruitful land; the bunch of grapes they brought with
them was an ocular demonstration of it, [Num
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#027.md). God had promised them a land
flowing with milk and honey, and the evil spies themselves own that it
is such a land. Thus even out of the mouth of adversaries will God be
glorified and the truth of his promise attested. And yet afterwards they
contradict themselves, when they say ([Num
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#032).md), It is a land that eateth up
the inhabitants thereof; as if, though it had milk, and honey, and
grapes, yet it wanted other necessary provision; some think that there
was a great plague in the country at the time they surveyed it, which
they ought to have imputed to the wisdom of the divine Providence, which
thus lessened the numbers of their enemies, to facilitate their
conquests; but they invidiously imputed it to the unwholesomeness of the
air, and thence took occasion to disparage the country. For this
unreasonable fear of a plague in Canaan, they were justly cut off
immediately by a plague in the wilderness, [Num
14:37](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#037). But, (2..md) They represented the
conquest of it as altogether impracticable, and that it was to no
purpose to attempt it. The people are strong ([Num
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#028).md), men of a great stature ([Num
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#032).md), stronger than we, [Num
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#031.md). The cities are represented as
impregnable fortresses: they are walled and very great, [Num
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#028.md). But nothing served their ill
purpose more than a description of the giants, on whom they lay a great
stress: We saw the children of Anak there ([Num
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#028).md), and again, we saw the giants,
those men of a prodigious size, the sons of Anak, who come of the
giants, [Num 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#033.md). They spoke as if
they were ready to tremble at the mention of them, as they had done at
the sight of them. "O these tremendous giants! when we were near them,
we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, not only little and weak, but
trembling and daunted." Compare [Job
39:20](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#020.md), Canst thou make him afraid as a
grasshopper? "Nay, and so we were in their sight; they looked upon us
with as much scorn and disdain as we did upon them with fear and
trembling." So that upon the whole matter they gave it in as their
judgment, We are not able to go up against them ([Num
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#031).md), and therefore must think of
taking some other course.

2\. Now, even if they had been to judge only by human probabilities,
they could not have been excused from the imputation of cowardice. Were
not the hosts of Israel very numerous? 600,000 effective men, well
marshalled and modelled, closely embodied, and entirely united in
interest and affection, constituted as formidable an army as perhaps was
ever brought into the field; many a less has done more than perhaps the
conquering of Canaan was, witness Alexander's army. Moses, their
commander-in-chief, was wise and brave; and if the people had put on
resolution, and behaved themselves valiantly, what could have stood
before them? It is true the Canaanites were strong, but they were
dispersed ([Num 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#029).md): Some dwell in
the south and others in the mountains; so that by reason of their
distance they could not soon get together, and by reason of their
divided interests they could not long keep together, to oppose Israel.
The country being plentiful would subsist an army, and, though the
cities were walled, if they could beat them in the field the
strong-holds would fall of course into their hands. And, lastly, as for
the giants, their overgrown stature would but make them the better mark,
and the bulkiest men have not always the best mettle.

3\. But, though they deserved to be posted for cowards, this was not the
worst, the scripture brands them for unbelievers. It was not any human
probabilities they were required to depend upon, but, (1.) They had the
manifest and sensible tokens of God's presence with them, and the
engagement of his power for them. The Canaanites were stronger than
Israel; suppose they were, but were they stronger than the God of
Israel? We are not able to deal with them, but is not God Almighty able?
Have we not him in the midst of us? Does not he go before us? And is any
thing too hard for him? Were we as grasshoppers before the giants, and
are not they less than grasshoppers before God? Their cities are walled
against us, but can they be walled against heaven? Besides this, (2.)
They had had very great experience of the length and strength of God's
arm, lifted up and made bare on their behalf. Were not the Egyptians as
much stronger than they as the Canaanites were? And yet, without a sword
drawn by Israel or a stroke struck, the chariots and horsemen of Egypt
were quite routed and ruined; the Amalekites took them at great
disadvantages, and yet they were discomfited. Miracles were at this time
their daily bread; were there nothing else, an army so well victualled
as theirs was, so constantly, so plentifully, and all on free cost,
would have a might advantage against any other force. Nay, (3.) They had
particular promises made them of victory and success in their wars
against the Canaanites. God had given Abraham all possible assurances
that he would put his seed into possession of that land, [Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md); [Gen
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#008.md). He had expressly promised them
by Moses that he would drive out the Canaanites from before them ([Exo
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#002).md), and that he would do it by
little and little, [Exo 23:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#030.md). And,
after all this, for them to say, We are not able to go up against them,
was in effect to say, "God himself is not able to make his words good."
It was in effect to give him the lie, and to tell him he had undertaken
more than he could perform. We have a short account of their sin, with
which they infected the whole congregation, [Psa
106:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#024.md). They despised the land, they
believed not his word. Though, upon search, they had found it as good as
he had said, a land flowing with milk and honey, yet they would not
believe it as sure as he had said, but despaired of having it, though
eternal truth itself had engaged it to them. And now this is the
representation of the evil spies.

II\. Caleb encouraged them to go forward, though he was seconded by
Joshua only ([Num 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#030).md): Caleb
stilled the people, whom he saw already put into a ferment even before
Moses himself, whose shining face could not daunt them, when they began
to grow unruly. Caleb signifies all heart, and he answered his name, was
hearty himself, and would have made the people so if they would have
hearkened to him. If Joshua had begun to stem the tide, he would have
been suspected of partiality to Moses, whose minister he was; and
therefore he prudently left it to Caleb's management at first, who was
of the tribe of Judah, the leading tribe, and therefore the fittest to
be heard. Caleb had seen and observed the strength of the inhabitants as
much as his fellows, and upon the whole matter, 1. He speaks very
confidently of success: We are well able to overcome them, as strong as
they are. 2. He animates the people to go on, and, his lot lying in the
van, he speaks as one resolved to lead them on with bravery: "Let us go
up at once, one bold step, one bold stroke more, will do our business;
it is all our own if we have but courage to make it so: Let us go up and
possess it." He does not say, "Let us go up and conquer it;" he looks
upon that to be as good as done already; but, "Let us go up and possess
it; there is nothing to be done but to enter, and take the possession
which God our great Lord is ready to give us." Note, The righteous are
bold as a lion. Difficulties that lie in the way of salvation dwindle
and vanish before a lively active faith in the power and promise of God.
All things are possible, if they be but promised, to him that believes.
