### [Exodus Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 30:0</span></span>

Moses is, in this chapter, further instructed, I. Concerning the altar
of incense ([Exo 30:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001).md). II.
Concerning the ransom-money which the Israelites were to pay, when they
were numbered ([Exo 30:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#011).md). III.
Concerning the laver of brass, which was set for the priests to wash in
([Exo 30:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#017).md). IV. Concerning the
making up of the anointing oil, and the use of it ([Exo
30:22-33](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#022).md). V. Concerning the incense
and perfume which were to be burned on the golden altar ([Exo
30:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#034), etc..md).

[Exodus 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 30:1</span></span>

I. The orders given concerning the altar of incense are, 1. That it was
to be made of wood, and covered with gold, pure gold, about a yard high
and half a yard square, with horns at the corners, a golden cornice
round it, with rings and staves of gold, for the convenience of carrying
it, [Exo 30:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001.md). It does not appear
that there was any grate to this altar for the ashes to fall into, that
they might be taken away; but, when they burnt incense, a golden censer
was brought with coals in it, and placed upon the altar, and in that
censer the incense was burnt, and with it all the coals were taken away,
so that no coals nor ashes fell upon the altar. The measure of the altar
of incense in Ezekiel's temple is double to what it is here ([Eze
41:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#022).md), and it is there called an
altar of wood, and there is no mention of gold, to signify that the
incense, in gospel times, should be spiritual, the worship plain, and
the service of God enlarged, for in every place incense should be
offered, [Mal 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011.md). 2. That it was to
be placed before the veil, on the outside of that partition, but before
the mercy-seat, which was within the veil, [Exo
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#006.md). For though he that ministered at
the altar could not see the mercy-seat, the veil interposing, yet he
must look towards it, and direct his incense that way, to teach us that
though we cannot with our bodily eyes see the throne of grace, that
blessed mercy-seat (for it is such a throne of glory that God, in
compassion to us, holds back the face of it, and spreads a cloud upon
it), yet we must in prayer by faith set ourselves before it, direct our
prayer, and look up. 3. That Aaron was to burn sweet incense upon this
altar, every morning and every evening, about half a pound at a time,
which was intended, not only to take away the ill smell of the flesh
that was burnt daily on the brazen altar, but for the honour of God, and
to show the acceptableness of his people's services to him, and the
pleasure which they should take in ministering to him, [Exo
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#007.md), [Exo
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#008.md). As by the offerings on the
brazen altar satisfaction was made for what had been done displeasing to
God, so, by the offering on this, what they did well was, as it were,
recommended to the divine acceptance; for our two great concerns with
God are to be acquitted from guilt and accepted as righteous in his
sight. 4. That nothing was to be offered upon it but incense, nor any
incense but that which was appointed, [Exo
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#009.md). God will have his own service
done according to his own appointment, and not otherwise. 5. That this
altar should be purified with the blood of the sin-offering put upon the
horns of it, every year, upon the day of atonement, [Exo
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#010.md). See [Lev
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#018.md), [Lev
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#019.md). The high priest was to take
this in his way, as he came out from the holy of holies. This was to
intimate to them that the sins of the priests who ministered at this
altar, and of the people for whom they ministered, put a ceremonial
impurity upon it, from which it must be cleansed by the blood of
atonement.

II\. This incense-altar typified, 1. The mediation of Christ. The brazen
altar in the court was a type of Christ dying on earth; the golden altar
in the sanctuary was a type of Christ interceding in heaven, in virtue
of his satisfaction. This altar was before the mercy-seat; for Christ
always appears in the presence of God for us; he is our advocate with
the father ([Jo1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001).md), and his
intercession is unto God of a sweet-smelling savour. This altar had a
crown fixed to it; for Christ intercedes as king. Father, I will, [Joh
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024.md). 2. The devotions of the saints,
whose prayers are said to be set forth before God as incense, [Psa
141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002.md). As the smoke of the incense
ascended, so much our desires towards God rise in prayer, being kindled
with the fire of holy love and other pious affections. When the priest
was burning incense the people were praying ([Luk
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#010).md), to signify that prayer is the
true incense. This incense was offered daily, it was a perpetual incense
([Exo 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#008).md); for we must pray always,
that is, we must keep up stated times for prayer every day, morning and
evening, at least, and never omit it, but thus pray without ceasing. The
lamps were dressed or lighted at the same time that the incense was
burnt, to teach us that the reading of the scriptures (which are our
light and lamp) is a part of our daily work, and should ordinarily
accompany our prayers and praises. When we speak to God we must hear
what God says to us, and thus the communion is complete. The devotions
of sanctified souls are well-pleasing to God, of a sweet-smelling
savour; the prayers of saints are compared to sweet odours ([Rev
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008).md), but it is the incense which
Christ adds to them that makes them acceptable ([Rev
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003).md), and his blood that atones for
the guilt which cleaves to our best services. And, if the heart and life
be not holy, even incense is an abomination ([Isa
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#013).md), and he that offers it is as if
he blessed an idol, [Isa 66:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#003.md).

[Exodus 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 30:11</span></span>

Some observe that the repetition of those words, The Lord spoke unto
Moses, here and afterwards ([Exo
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#017.md), [Exo
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#022.md), [Exo
30:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#034).md), intimates that God did not
deliver these precepts to Moses in the mount, in a continued discourse,
but with many intermissions, giving him time either to write what was
said to him or at least to charge his memory with it. Christ gave
instructions to his disciples as they were able to hear them. Moses is
here ordered to levy money upon the people by way of poll, so much a
head, for the service of the tabernacle. This he must do when he
numbered the people. Some think that it refers only to the first
numbering of them, now when the tabernacle was set up; and that this tax
was to make up what was deficient in the voluntary contributions for the
finishing of the work, or rather for the beginning of the service in the
tabernacle. Others think that it was afterwards repeated upon any
emergency and always when the people were numbered, and that David
offended in not demanding it when he numbered the people. But many of
the Jewish writers, and others from them, are of opinion that it was to
be an annual tribute, only it was begun when Moses first numbered the
people. This was that tribute-money which Christ paid, for fear of
offending his adversaries ([Mat
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#027).md), when yet he showed good reason
why he should have been excused. Men were appointed in every city to
receive this payment yearly. Now, 1. The tribute to be paid was half a
shekel, about fifteen pence of our money. The rich were not to give
more, nor the poor less ([Exo 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#015).md),
to intimate that the souls of the rich and poor are alike precious, and
that God is no respecter of persons, [Act
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034.md); [Job
34:19](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#019.md). In other offerings men were to
give according to their ability; but this, which was the ransom of the
soul, must be alike for all; for the rich have as much need of Christ as
the poor, and the poor are as welcome to him as the rich. They both
alike contributed to the maintenance of the temple-service, because both
were to have a like interest in it and benefit by it. In Christ and his
ordinances rich and poor meet together; the Lord is the Maker, the Lord
Christ is the Redeemer of them both, [Pro
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#002.md). The Jews say, "If a man refused
to pay this tribute, he was not comprehended in the expiation." 2. this
tribute was to be paid as a ransom of the soul, that there might be no
plague among them. Hereby they acknowledged that they received their
lives from God, that they had forfeited their lives to him, and that
they depended upon his power and patience for the continuance of them;
and thus they did homage to the God of their lives, and deprecated those
plagues which their sins had deserved. 3. This money that was raised was
to be employed in the service of the tabernacle ([Exo
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#016).md); with it they bought
sacrifices, flour, incense, wine, oil, fuel, salt, priests' garments,
and all other things which the whole congregation was interested in.
Note, Those that have the benefit of God's tabernacle among them must be
willing to defray the expenses of it, and not grudge the necessary
charges of God's public worship. Thus we must honour the Lord with our
substance, and reckon that best laid out which is laid out in the
service of God. Money indeed cannot make an atonement for the soul, but
it may be used for the honour of him who has made the atonement, and for
the maintenance of the gospel by which the atonement is applied.

[Exodus 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 30:17</span></span>

Orders are here given, 1. For the making of a laver, or font, of brass,
a large vessel, that would contain a good quantity of water, which was
to be set near the door of the tabernacle, [Exo
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#018.md). The foot of brass, it is
supposed, was so contrived as to receive the water, which was let into
it out of the laver by spouts or cocks. They then had a laver for the
priests only to wash in, but to us now there is a fountain open for
Judah and Jerusalem to wash in ([Zac
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001).md), an inexhaustible fountain of
living water, so that it is our own fault if we remain in our pollution.
2. For the using of this laver. Aaron and his sons must wash their hands
and feet at this laver every time they went in to minister, every
morning, at least, [Exo 30:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#019.md). For
this purpose clean water was put into the laver fresh every day. Though
they washed themselves ever so clean at their own houses, that would not
serve; they must wash at the laver, because that was appointed for
washing, [Kg2 5:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#012.md). This was
designed, (1.) To teach them purity in all their ministrations, and to
possess them with a reverence of God's holiness and a dread of the
pollutions of sin. They must not only wash and be made clean when they
were first consecrated, but they must wash and be kept clean whenever
they went in to minister. He only shall stand in God's holy place that
has clean hands and a pure heart, [Psa
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#003.md), [Psa
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004). And, (2..md) It was to teach us,
who are daily to attend upon God, daily to renew our repentance for sin
and our believing application of the blood of Christ to our souls for
remission; for in many things we daily offend and contract pollution,
[Joh 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#008.md), [Joh
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#010.md); [Jam
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#002.md). This is the preparation we are to
make for solemn ordinances. Cleanse your hands and purify your hearts,
and then draw nigh to God, [Jam 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008.md).
To this law David alludes in [Psa
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#006.md), I will wash my hands in
innocency, so will I compass thine altar, O Lord.

[Exodus 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 30:22</span></span>

Directions are here given for the composition of the holy anointing oil
and the incense that were to be used in the service of the tabernacle;
with these God was to be honoured, and therefore he would appoint the
making of them; for nothing comes to God but what comes from him. 1. The
holy anointing oil is here ordered to be made up the ingredients, and
their quantities, are prescribed, [Exo
30:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#023.md). Interpreters are not agreed
concerning them; we are sure, in general, they were the best and fittest
for the purpose; they must needs be so when the divine wisdom appointed
them for the divine honour. It was to be compounded secundum artem -
after the art of the apothecary ([Exo
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#025).md); the spices, which were in all
nearly half a hundred weight, were to be infused in the oil, which was
to be about five or six quarts, and then strained out, leaving an
admirable sweet smell in the oil. With this oil God's tent and all the
furniture of it were to be anointed; it was to be used also in the
consecration of the priests, [Exo
30:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#026.md). It was to be continued
throughout their generations, [Exo
30:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#031.md). The tradition of the Jews is
that this very oil which was prepared by Moses himself lasted till near
the captivity. But bishop Patrick shows the great improbability of the
tradition, and supposes that it was repeated according to the
prescription here, for Solomon was anointed with it ([Kg1
1:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#039).md), and some other of the kings;
and all the high priests with such a quantity of it that it ran down to
the skirts of the garments; and we read of the making up of this
ointment ([Ch1 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#030).md): yet all agree
that in the second temple there was none of this holy oil, which he
supposes was owing to a notion they had that it was not lawful to make
it up, Providence overruling that want as a presage of the better
unction of the Holy Ghost in gospel times, the variety of whose gifts
was typified by these several sweet ingredients. To show the excellency
of holiness, there was that in the tabernacle which was in the highest
degree grateful both to the sight and to the smell. Christ's name is
said to be as ointment poured forth ([Sol
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003).md), and the good name of Christians
better than precious ointment, [Ecc
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001.md). 2. The incense which was burned
upon the golden altar was prepared of sweet spices likewise, though not
so rare and rich as those of which the anointing oil was compounded,
[Exo 30:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#034.md), [Exo
30:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#035.md). This was prepared once a year
(the Jews say), a pound for each day of the year, and three pounds over
for the day of atonement. When it was used, it was to be beaten very
small: thus it pleased the Lord to bruise the Redeemer when he offered
himself for a sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savour. 3. Concerning both
these preparations the same law is here given ([Exo
30:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#032.md), [Exo
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#033.md), [Exo
30:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#037.md), [Exo
30:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#038).md), that the like should not be
made for any common use. Thus God would preserve in the people's minds a
reverence for his own institutions, and teach us not to profane nor
abuse any thing whereby God makes himself known, as those did who
invented to themselves (for their common entertainments) instruments of
music like David, [Amo 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#005.md). It is a
great affront to God to jest with sacred things, particularly to make
sport with the word and ordinances of God, or to treat them with
lightness, [Mat 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#005.md). That which is
God's peculiar must not be used as a common thing.
