### [Matthew Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001.md)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 21:0</span></span>

The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ are the two main hinges upon
which the door of salvation turns. He came into the world on purpose to
give his life a ransom; so he had lately said, ch. 20, 28. And therefore
the history of his sufferings, even unto death, and his rising again, is
more particularly recorded by all the evangelists than any other part of
his story; and to that this evangelist now hastens apace. For at this
chapter begins that which is called the passion-week. He had said to his
disciples more than once, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and there the
Son of man must be betrayed. A great deal of good work he did by the
way, and now at length he is come up to Jerusalem; and here we have, I.
The public entry which he made into Jerusalem, upon the first day of the
passion-week ([Mat 21:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001).md). II. The
authority he exercised there, in cleansing the temple, and driving out
of it the buyers and sellers ([Mat
21:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012).md). III. The barren fig-tree,
and his discourse with his disciples thereupon ([Mat
21:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#017).md). IV. His justifying his own
authority, by appealing to the baptism of John ([Mat
21:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#023).md). V. His shaming the
infidelity and obstinacy of the chief priests and elders, with the
repentance of the publicans, illustrated by the parable of the two sons
([Mat 21:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#029).md). VI. His reading the
doom of the Jewish church for its unfruitfulness, in the parable of the
vineyard let out to unthankful husbandmen ([Mat
21:33-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033).md).

[Matthew 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 21:1</span></span>

All the four evangelists take notice of this passage of Christ's riding
in triumph into Jerusalem, five days before his death. The passover was
on the fourteenth day of the month, and this was the tenth; on which day
the law appointed that the paschal lamb should be taken up ([Exo
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#003).md), and set apart for that service;
on that day therefore Christ our Passover, who was to be sacrificed for
us, was publicly showed. So that this was the prelude to his passion. He
had lodged at Bethany, a village not far from Jerusalem, for some time;
at a supper there the night before Mary had anointed his feet, [Joh
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#003.md). But, as usual with ambassadors,
he deferred his public entry till some time after his arrival. Our Lord
Jesus travelled much, and his custom was to travel on foot from Galilee
to Jerusalem, some scores of miles, which was both humbling and
toilsome; many a dirty weary step he had when he went about doing good.
How ill does it become Christians to be inordinately solicitous about
their own ease and state, when their Master had so little of either! Yet
once in his life he rode in triumph; and it was now when he went into
Jerusalem, to suffer and die, as if that were the pleasure and
preferment he courted; and then he thought himself begin to look great.

Now here we have,

I. The provision that was made for this solemnity; and it was very poor
and ordinary, and such as bespoke his kingdom to be not of this world.
Here were no heralds at arms provided, no trumpet sounded before him, no
chariots of state, no liveries; such things as these were not agreeable
to his present state of humiliation, but will be far outdone at his
second coming, to which his magnificent appearance is reserved, when the
last trumpet shall sound, the glorious angels shall be his heralds and
attendants, and the clouds his chariots. But in this public appearance,

1\. The preparation was sudden and offhand. for his glory in the other
world, and ours with him, preparation was made before the foundation of
the world, for that was the glory his heart was upon; his glory in this
world he was dead to, and therefore, though he had it in prospect, did
not forecast for it, but took what came next. They were come to
Bethphage, which was the suburb of Jerusalem, and was accounted (say the
Jewish doctors) in all things, as Jerusalem, a long scattering street
that lay toward the mount of Olives; when he entered upon that, he sent
two of his disciples, some think Peter and John, to fetch him an ass,
for he had none ready for him.

2\. It was very mean. He sent only for an ass and her colt, [Mat
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#002.md). Asses were much used in that
country for travel; horses were kept only by great men, and for war.
Christ could have summoned a cherub to carry him ([Psa
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010).md); but though by his name Jah,
which speaks him God, he rides upon the heavens, yet now by his name
Jesus, Immanuel, God with us, in his state of humiliation, he rides upon
an ass. Yet some think that he had herein an eye to the custom in Israel
for the judges to ride upon white asses ([Jdg
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#010).md), and their sons on ass-colts,
[Jdg 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#014.md). And Christ would thus
enter, not as a Conqueror, but as the Judge of Israel, who for judgment
came into this world.

3\. It was not his own, but borrowed. Though he had not a house of his
own, yet, one would think, like some wayfaring men that live upon their
friends, he might have had an ass of his own, to carry him about; but
for our sakes he became in all respects poor, [Co2
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009.md). It is commonly said, "They that
live on borrowing, live on sorrowing;" in this therefore, as in other
things, Christ was a man of sorrows - that he had nothing of this
world's goods but what was given him or lent him.

The disciples who were sent to borrow this ass are directed to say, The
Lord has need of him. Those that are in need, must not be ashamed to own
their need, nor say, as the unjust steward, To beg I am ashamed, [Luk
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#003.md). On the other hand, none ought to
impose upon the kindness of their friends, by going to beg or borrow
when they have not need. In the borrowing of this ass,

(1.) We have an instance of Christ's knowledge. Though the thing was
altogether contingent, yet Christ could tell his disciples where they
should find an ass tied, and a colt with her. His omniscience extends
itself to the meanest of his creatures; asses and their colts, and their
being bound or loosed. Doth God take care for oxen? ([Co1
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009)..md) No doubt he doth, and would not
see Balaam's ass abused. He knows all the creatures, so as to make them
serve his own purpose.

(2.) We have an instance of his power over the spirits of men. The
hearts of the meanest subjects, as well as of kings, are in the hand of
the Lord. Christ asserts his right to use the ass, in bidding them bring
it to him; the fulness of the earth is the Lord Christ's; but he
foresees some hindrance which disciples might meet with in this service;
they must not take them clam et secreto - privily, but in the sight of
the owner, much less vi et armis - with force and arms, but with the
consent of the owner, which he undertakes they shall have; If any man
say aught to you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of him. Note, What
Christ sets us to do, he will bear us out in the doing of, and furnish
us with answers tot he objections we may be assaulted with, and make
them prevalent; as here, Straightway he will send them. Christ, in
commanding the ass into his service, showed that he is Lord of hosts;
and, in inclining the owner to send him without further security, showed
that he is the God of the spirits of all flesh, and can bow men's
hearts.

(3.) We have an example of justice and honesty, in not using the ass,
though for so small a piece of service as riding the length of a street
or two, without the owner's consent. As some read the latter clause, it
gives us a further rule of justice; "You shall say the Lord hath need of
them, and he" (that is, the Lord) "will presently send them back, and
take care that they be safely delivered to the owner, as soon as he has
done with them." Note, What we borrow we must restore in due time and in
good order; for the wicked borrows and pays not again. Care must be
taken of borrowed goods, that they be not damaged. Alas, Master, for it
was borrowed!

II\. The prediction that was fulfilled in this, [Mat
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#004.md), [Mat
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#005.md). Our Lord Jesus, in all that he
did and suffered, had very much his eye upon this, That the scriptures
might be fulfilled. As the prophets looked forward to him (to him they
all bare witness), so he looked upon them, that all things which were
written of the Messiah, might be punctually accomplished in him. This
particularly which was written of him, [Zac
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009.md), where it ushers in a large
prediction of the kingdom of the Messiah, Tell ye the daughter of Sion,
Behold, thy King cometh, must be accomplished. Now observe here,

1\. How the coming of Christ is foretold; Tell ye the daughter of Sion,
the church, the holy mountain, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee. Note,
(1.) Jesus Christ is the church's King, one of our brethren like unto
us, according to the law of the kingdom, [Deu
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#015.md). He is appointed King over the
church, [Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md). He is accepted King
by the church; the daughter of Sion swears allegiance to him, [Hos
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#011). (2..md) Christ, the King of his
church, came to his church, even in this lower world; he comes to thee,
to rule thee, to rule in thee, to rule for thee; he is Head over all
things to the church. He came to Sion ([Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026).md), that out of Sion the law might
go forth; for the church and its interests were all in all with the
Redeemer. (3.) Notice was given to the church beforehand of the coming
of her King; Tell the daughter of Sion. Note, Christ will have his
coming looked for, and waited for, and his subjects big with expectation
of it; Tell the daughters of Sion, that they may go forth, and behold
King Solomon, [Sol 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#011.md). Notices of
Christ's coming are usually ushered in with a Behold! A note commanding
both attention and admiration; Behold thy King cometh; behold, and
wonder at him, behold, and welcome him. Here is a royal progress truly
admirable. Pilate, like Caiaphas, said he knew not what, in that great
word ([Joh 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#014).md), Behold your King.

2\. How his coming is described. When a king comes, something great and
magnificent is expected, especially when he comes to take possession of
his kingdom. The King, the Lord of hosts, was seen upon a throne, high
and lifted up ([Isa 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001).md); but there is
nothing of that here; Behold, he cometh to thee, meek, and sitting upon
an ass. When Christ would appear in his glory, it is in his meekness,
not in his majesty.

(1.) His temper is very mild. He comes not in wrath to take vengeance,
but in mercy to work salvation. He is meek to suffer the greatest
injuries and indignities for Sion's cause, meek to bear with the follies
and unkindness of Sion's own children. He is easy of access, easy to be
entreated. He is meek not only as a Teacher, but as a Ruler; he rules by
love. His government is mild and gentle, and his laws not written in the
blood of his subjects, but in his own. His yoke is easy.

(2.) As an evidence of this, his appearance is very mean, sitting upon
an ass, as creature made not for state, but service, not for battles,
but for burthens; slow in its motions, but sure, and safe, and constant.
The foretelling of this so long before, and the care taken that it
should be exactly fulfilled, intimate it to have a peculiar
significancy, for the encouragement of poor souls to apply themselves to
Christ. Sion's King comes riding, not on a prancing horse, which the
timorous petitioner dares not come near, or a running horse, which the
slow-footed petitioner cannot keep pace with, but on a quiet ass, that
the poorest of his subjects may not be discouraged in their access to
him. Mention is made in the prophecy of a colt, the foal of an ass; and
therefore Christ sent for the colt with the ass, that the scripture
might be fulfilled.

III\. The procession itself, which was answerable to the preparation,
both being destitute of worldly pomp, and yet both accompanied with a
spiritual power.

Observe, 1. His equipage; The disciples did as Jesus commanded them
([Mat 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#006).md); they went to fetch the
ass and the colt, not doubting but to find them, and to find the owner
willing to lend them. Note, Christ's commands must not be disputed, but
obeyed; and those that sincerely obey them, shall not be balked or
baffled in it; They brought the ass and the colt. The meanness and
contemptibleness of the beast Christ rode on, might have been made up
with the richness of the trappings; but those were, like all the rest,
such as came next to hand; they had not so much as a saddle for the ass,
but the disciples threw some of their clothes upon it, and that must
serve for want of better accommodations. Note, We ought not to be nice
or curious, or to affect exactness, in outward conveniences. A holy
indifference or neglect well becomes us in these things: it will
evidence that our heart is not upon them, and that we have learned the
apostle's rule ([Rom 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#016), margin.md),
to be content with mean things. Any thing will serve travellers; and
there is a beauty in some sort of carelessness, a noble negligence; yet
the disciples furnished him with the best they had, and did not object
the spoiling of their clothes when the Lord had need of them. Note, We
must not think the clothes on our backs too der to part with for the
service of Christ, for the clothing of his poor destitute and afflicted
members. I was naked, and you clothed me, [Mat
25:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#036.md). Christ stripped himself for us.

2\. His retinue; there was nothing in this stately or magnificent.
Sion's King comes to Sion, and the daughter of Sion was told of his
coming long before; yet he is not attended by the gentlemen of the
country, nor met by the magistrates of the city in their formalities as
one might have expected; he should have had the keys of the city
presented to him, and should have been conducted with all possible
convenience to the thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of
David; but here is nothing of all this; yet he has his attendants, a
very great multitude; they were only the common people, the mob (the
rabble we should have been apt to call them), that graced the solemnity
of Christ's triumph, and none but such. The chief priests and the elders
afterward herded themselves with the multitude that abused him upon the
cross; but we find none of them here joining with the multitude that did
him honour. Ye see here your calling, brethren, not many mighty, or
noble, attend on Christ, but the foolish things of this world and base
things, which are despised, [Co1 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026.md),
[Co1 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#028.md). Note, Christ is honoured by
the multitude, more than by the magnificence, of his followers; for he
values men by their souls, not by their preferments, names, or titles of
honour.

Now, concerning this great multitude, we are here told,

(1.) What they did; according to the best of their capacity, they
studied to do honour to Christ. \[1.\] They spread their garments in the
way, that he might ride upon them. When Jehu was proclaimed king, the
captains put their garments under him, in token of their subjection to
him. Note, Those that take Christ for their King must lay their all
under his feet; the clothes, in token of the heart; for when Christ
comes, though not when any one else comes, it must be said to the soul,
Bow down, that he may go over. Some think that these garments were
spread, not upon the ground, but on the hedges or walls, to adorn the
roads; as, to beautify a cavalcade, the balconies are hung with
tapestry. This was but a poor piece of state, yet Christ accepted their
good-will; and we are hereby taught to contrive how to make Christ
welcome, Christ and his grace, Christ and his gospel, into our hearts
and houses. How shall we express our respects to Christ? What honour and
what dignity shall be done to him? \[2.\] Others cut down branches from
the trees, and strewed them in the way, as they used to do at the feast
of tabernacles, in token of liberty, victory, and joy; for the mystery
of that feast is particularly spoken of as belonging to gospel times,
[Zac 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016.md).

(2.) What they said; They that went before, and they that followed, were
in the same tune; both those that gave notice of his coming, and those
that attended him with their applauses, cried, saying, Hosanna to the
Son of David, [Mat 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md). When they
carried branches about at the feast of tabernacles, they were wont to
cry Hosanna, and from thence to call their bundles of branches their
hosannas. Hosanna signifies, Save now, we beseech thee; referring to
[Psa 118:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025.md), [Psa
118:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#026.md), where the Messiah is
prophesied of as the Head-stone of the corner, though the builders
refused him; and all his loyal subjects are brought in triumphing with
him, and attending him with hearty good wishes to the prosperity of all
his enterprises. Hosanna to the Son of David is, "This we do in honour
of the Son of David."

The hosannas with which Christ was attended bespeak two things:

\[1.\] Their welcoming his kingdom. Hosanna bespeaks the same with,
Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. It was foretold
concerning this Son of David, that all nations shall call him blessed
([Psa 72:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017).md); these here began, and
all true believers in all ages concur in it, and call him blessed; it is
the genuine language of faith. Note, First, Jesus Christ comes in the
name of the Lord; he is sanctified, and sent into the world, as
Mediator; him hath God the Father sealed. Secondly, The coming of Christ
in the name of the Lord, is worthy of all acceptation; and we all ought
to say, Blessed is he that cometh; to praise him, and be pleased in him.
Let his coming in the name of the Lord be mentioned with strong
affections, to our comfort, and joyful acclamations, to his glory. Well
may we say, Blessed is he; for it is in him that we are blessed. Well
may we follow him with our blessings, who meets us with his.

\[2.\] Their wishing well to his kingdom; intimated in their Hosanna;
earnestly desiring that prosperity and success may attend it, and that
it may be a victorious kingdom; "Send now prosperity to that kingdom."
If they understood it of a temporal kingdom, and had their hearts
carried out thus toward that, it was their mistake, which a little time
would rectify; however, their good-will was accepted. Note, It is our
duty earnestly to desire and pray for the prosperity and success of
Christ's kingdom in the world. Thus prayer must be made for him
continually ([Psa 72:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015).md), that all
happiness may attend his interest in the world, and that, though he may
ride on an ass, yet in his majesty he may ride prosperously, because of
that meekness, [Psa 45:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#004.md). This we mean
when we pray, Thy kingdom come. They add, Hosanna in the highest: Let
prosperity in the highest degree attend him, let him have a name above
every name, a throne above every throne; or, Let us praise him in the
best manner for his church ascend to heaven, to the highest heavens, and
fetch in peace and salvation from thence. See [Psa
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#006.md). The Lord saveth his Anointed,
and will hear from his high, his holy heaven.

3\. We have here his entertainment in Jerusalem ([Mat
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#010).md); When he was come into
Jerusalem, all the city was moved; every one took notice of him, some
were moved with wonder at the novelty of the thing, others with laughter
at the meanness of it; some perhaps were moved with joy, who waited for
the Consolation of Israel; others, of the Pharisaical class, were moved
with envy and indignation. So various are the motions in the minds of
men upon the approach of Christ's kingdom!

Upon this commotion we are further told,

(1.) What the citizens said; Who is this? \[1.\] They were, it seems,
ignorant concerning Christ. Though he was the Glory of his people
Israel, yet Israel knew him not; though he had distinguished himself by
the many miracles he wrought among them, yet the daughters of Jerusalem
knew him not from another beloved, [Sol
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#009.md). The Holy One unknown in the holy
city! In places where the clearest light shines, and the greatest
profession of religion is made, there is more ignorance than we are.
\[2.\] Yet they were inquisitive concerning him. Who is this that is
thus cried, and comes with so much observation? Who is this King of
glory, that demands admission into our hearts? [Psa
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#008.md); [Isa
63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md).

(2.) How the multitude answered them; This is Jesus, [Mat
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#011.md). The multitude were better
acquainted with Christ than the great ones. Vox populi - The voice of
the people, is sometimes Vox Dei - the voice of God. Now, in the account
they give of him, \[1.\] They were right in calling him the Prophet,
that great Prophet. Hitherto he had been known as a Prophet, teaching
and working miracles; now they attend him as a King; Christ's priestly
office was, of all the three, last discovered. \[2.\] Yet they missed
it, in saying he was of Nazareth; and it helped to confirm some in their
prejudices against him. Note, Some that are willing to honour Christ,
and bear their testimony to him, yet labour under mistakes concerning
him, which would be rectified if they would take pains to inform
themselves.

[Matthew 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 21:12</span></span>

When Christ came into Jerusalem, he did not go up to the court or the
palace, though he came in as a King, but into the temple; for his
kingdom is spiritual, and not of this world; it is in holy things that
he rules, in the temple of God that he exercises authority. Now, what
did he do there?

I. Thence he drove the buyers and sellers. Abuses must first be purged
out, and the plants not of God's planting be plucked up, before that
which is right can be established. The great Redeemer appear as a great
Reformer, that turns away ungodliness, [Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026.md). Here we are told,

1\. What he did ([Mat 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012).md); He cast
out all them that sold and bought; he had done this once before ([Joh
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#014.md), [Joh
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#015).md), but there was occasion to do it
again. Note, Buyers and sellers driven out of the temple, will return
and nestle there again, if there be not a continual care and oversight
to prevent it, and if the blow be not followed, and often repeated.

(1.) The abuse was, buying and selling, and changing money, in the
temple. Note, Lawful things, ill timed and ill placed, may become sinful
things. That which was decent enough in another place, and not only
lawful, but laudable, on another day, defiles the sanctuary, and
profanes the sabbath. This buying and selling, and changing money,
though secular employments, yet had the pretence of being in ordine ad
spiritualia - for spiritual purposes. They sold beasts for sacrifice,
for the convenience of those that could more easily bring their money
with them than their beast; and they changed money for those that wanted
the half shekel, which was their yearly poll, or redemption-money; or,
upon the bills of return; so that this might pass for the outward
business of the house of God; and yet Christ will not allow of it. Note,
Great corruptions and abuses come into the church by the practices of
those whose gain is godliness, that is, who make worldly gain the end of
their godliness, and counterfeit godliness their way to worldly gain
([Ti1 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#005).md); from such withdraw
thyself.

(2.) The purging out of this abuse. Christ cast them out that sold. He
did it before with a scourge of small cords ([Joh
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#015).md); now he did it with a look, with
a frown, with a word of command. Some reckon this none of the least of
Christ's miracles, that he should himself thus clear the temple, and not
be opposed in it by them who by this craft got their living, and were
backed in it by the priests and elders. It is an instance of his power
over the spirits of men, and the hold he has of them by their own
consciences. This was the only act of regal authority and coercive power
that Christ did in the days of his flesh; he began with it, Jn. 2 and
here ended with it. Tradition says, that his face shone, and beams of
light darted from his blessed eyes, which astonished these
market-people, and compelled them to yield to his command; if so, the
scripture was fulfilled, [Pro 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#008.md), A
King that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil
with his eyes. He overthrew the tables of the money-changers; he did not
take the money to himself, but scattered it, threw it to the ground, the
fittest place for it. The Jews, in Esther's time, on the spoil laid not
their hand, [Est 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#010.md).

2\. What he said, to justify himself, and to convict them ([Mat
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#013).md); It is written. Note, In the
reformation of the church, the eye must be upon the scripture, and that
must be adhered to as the rule, the pattern in the mount; and we must go
no further than we can justify ourselves with, It is written.
Reformation is then right, when corrupted ordinances are reduced to
their primitive institution.

(1.) He shows, from a scripture prophecy, what the temple should be, and
was designed to be; My house shall be called the house of prayer; which
is quoted from [Isa 56:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#007.md). Note, All
the ceremonial institutions were intended to be subservient to moral
duties; the house of sacrifices was to be a house of prayer, for that
was the substance and soul of all those services; the temple was in a
special manner sanctified to be a house of prayer, for it was not only
the place of that worship, but the medium of it, so that the prayers
made in or toward that house had a particular promise of acceptance
([Ch2 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#021).md), as it was a type of
Christ; therefore Daniel looked that way in prayer; and in this sense no
house or place is now, or can be, a house of prayer, for Christ is our
Temple; yet in some sense the appointed places of our religious
assemblies may be so called, as places where prayer is wont to be made,
[Act 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#013.md).

(2.) He shows, from a scripture reproof, how they had abused the temple,
and perverted the intention of it; Ye have made it a den of thieves.
This is quoted from [Jer 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#011.md), Is this
house become a den of robbers in your eyes? When dissembled piety is
made the cloak and cover of iniquity, it may be said that the house of
prayer is become a den of thieves, in which they lurk, and shelter
themselves. Markets are too often dens of thieves, so many are the
corrupt and cheating practices in buying and selling; but markets in the
temple are certainly so, for they rob God of his honour, the worst of
thieves, [Mal 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#008.md). The priests lived,
and lived plentifully, upon the altar; but, not content with that, they
found other ways and means to squeeze money out of the people; and
therefore Christ here calls them thieves, for they exacted that which
did not belong to them.

II\. There, in the temple, he healed the blind and the lame, [Mat
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#014.md). When he had driven the buyers
and sellers out of the temple, he invited the blind and lame into it;
for he fills the hungry with good things, but the rich he sends empty
away. Christ, in the temple, by his word there preached, and in answer
to the prayers there made, heals those that are spiritually blind and
lame. It is good coming to the temple, when Christ is there, who, as he
shows himself jealous for the honour of his temple, in expelling those
who profane it, so he shows himself gracious to those who humbly seek
him. The blind and the lame were debarred David's palace ([Sa2
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#008).md), but were admitted into God's
house; for the state and honour of his temple lie not in those things
wherein the magnificence of princes' palaces is supposed to consist;
from them blind and lame must keep their distance, but from God's temple
only the wicked and profane. The temple was profane and abused when it
was made a market-place, but it was graced and honoured when it was made
an hospital; to be doing good in God's, is more honourable, and better
becomes it, than to be getting money there. Christ's healing was a real
answer to that question, Who is this? His works testified of him more
than the hosannas; and his healing in the temple was the fulfilling of
the promise, that the glory of the latter house should be greater than
the glory of the former.

There also he silenced the offence which the chief priests and scribes
took at the acclamations with which he was attended, [Mat
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#015.md), [Mat
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#016.md). They that should have been most
forward to give him honour, were his worst enemies.

1\. They were inwardly vexed at the wonderful things that he did; they
could not deny them to be true miracles, and therefore were cut to the
heart with indignation at them, as [Act
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#016.md); [Act
5:33](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#033.md). The works that Christ did,
recommended themselves to every man's conscience. If they had any sense,
they could not but own the miracle of them; and if any good nature,
could not but be in love with the mercy of them: yet, because they were
resolved to oppose him, for these they envied him, and bore him a
grudge.

2\. They openly quarrelled at the children's hosannas; they thought that
hereby an honour was given him, which did not belong to him, and that it
looked like ostentation. Proud men cannot bear that honour should be
done to any but to themselves, and are uneasy at nothing more than at
the just praises of deserving men. Thus Saul envied David the women's
songs; and "Who can stand before envy?" When Christ is most honoured,
his enemies are most displeased.

Just now we had Christ preferring the blind and the lame before the
buyers and sellers; now here we have him ([Mat
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#016).md), taking part with the children
against priests and scribes.

Observe, (1.) The children were in the temple, perhaps playing there; no
wonder, when the rulers make it a market-place, that the children make
it a place of pastime; but we are willing to hope that many of them were
worshipping there. Note, It is good to bring children betimes to the
house of prayer, for of such is the kingdom of heaven. Let children be
taught to keep up the form of godliness, it will help to lead them to
the power of it. Christ has a tenderness for the lambs of his flock.

(2.) They were there crying Hosanna to the Son of David. This they
learned from those that were grown up. Little children say and do as
they hear others say, and see others do; so easily do they imitate; and
therefore great care must be taken to set them good examples, and no bad
ones. Maxima debetur puero reverentia - Our intercourse with the young
should be conducted with the most scrupulous care. Children will learn
of those that are with them, either to curse and swear, or to pray and
praise. The Jews did betimes teach their children to carry branches at
the feast of tabernacles, and to cry Hosanna; but God taught them here
to apply it to Christ. Note, Hosanna to the Son of David well becomes
the mouths of little children, who should learn young the language of
Canaan.

(3.) Our Lord Jesus not only allowed it, but was very well pleased with
it, and quoted a scripture which was fulfilled in it ([Psa
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#002).md), or, at least, may be
accommodated to it; Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast
perfected praise; which, some think, refers to the children's joining in
the acclamations of the people, and the women's songs with which David
was honoured when he returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, and
therefore is very fitly applied here to the hosannas with which the Son
of David was saluted, now that he was entering upon his conflict with
Satan, that Goliath. Note, \[1.\] Christ is so far from being ashamed of
the services of little children, that he takes particular notice of them
(and children love to be taken notice of), and is well pleased with
them. If God may be honoured by babes and sucklings, who are made to
hope at the best, much more by children who are grown up to maturity and
some capacity. \[2.\] Praise is perfected out of the mouth of such; it
has a peculiar tendency to the honour and glory of God for little
children to join in his praises; the praise would be accounted defective
and imperfect, if they had not their share in it; which is an
encouragement for children to be good betimes, and to parents to teach
them to be so; the labour neither of the one nor of the other shall be
in vain. In the psalm it is, Thou hast ordained strength. Note, God
perfecteth praise, by ordaining strength out of the mouths of babes and
sucklings. When great things are brought about by weak and unlikely
instruments, God is thereby much honoured, for his strength is perfected
in weakness, and the infirmities of the babes and sucklings serve for a
foil to the divine power. That which follows in the psalm, That thou
mightest still the enemy and the avenger, was very applicable to the
priests and scribes; but Christ did not apply it to them, but left it to
them to apply it.

Lastly, Christ, having thus silenced them, forsook them, [Mat
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#017.md). He left them, in prudence, lest
they should now have seized him before his hour was come; in justice,
because they had forfeited the favour of his presence. By repining at
Christ's praises we drive him from us. He left them as incorrigible, and
he went out of the city to Bethany, which was a more quiet retired
place; not so much that he might sleep undisturbed as that he might pray
undisturbed. Bethany was but two little miles from Jerusalem; thither he
went on foot, to show that, when he rode, it was only to fulfil the
scripture. He was not lifted up with the hosannas of the people; but, as
having forgot them, soon returned to his mean and toilsome way of
travelling.

[Matthew 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 21:18</span></span>

Observe,

I. Christ returned in the morning to Jerusalem, [Mat
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#018.md). Some think that he went out of
the city over-night, because none of his friends there durst entertain
him, for fear of the great men; yet, having work to do there, he
returned. Note, We must never be driven off from our duty either by the
malice of our foes, or the unkindness of our friends. Though he knew
that in this city bonds and afflictions did abide him, yet none of these
things moved him. Paul followed him when he went bound in the spirit to
Jerusalem, [Act 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#022.md).

II\. As he went, he hungered. He was a Man, and submitted to the
infirmities of nature; he was an active Man, and was so intent upon his
work, that he neglected his food, and came out, fasting; for the zeal of
God's house did even eat him up, and his meat and drink was to do his
Father's will. He was a poor Man, and had no present supply; he was a
Man that pleased not himself, for he would willingly have taken up with
green raw figs for his breakfast, when it was fit that he should have
had something warm.

Christ therefore hungered, that he might have occasion to work this
miracle, in cursing and so withering the barren fig-tree, and therein
might give us an instance of his justice and his power, and both
instructive.

1\. See his justice, [Mat 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#019.md). He
went to it, expecting fruit, because it had leaves; but, finding none,
he sentenced it to a perpetual barrenness. The miracle had its
significance, as well as others of his miracles. All Christ's miracles
hitherto were wrought for the good of men, and proved the power of his
grace and blessing (the sending the devils into the herd of swine was
but a permission); all he did was for the benefit and comfort of his
friends, none for the terror or punishment of his enemies; but now, at
last, to show that all judgment is committed to him, and that he is able
not only to save, but to destroy, he would give a specimen of the power
of his wrath and curse; yet this not on any man, woman, or child,
because the great day of his wrath is not yet come, but on an inanimate
tree; that is set forth for an example; Come, learn a parable of the
fig-tree, [Mat 24:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#032.md). The scope of it
is the same with the parable of the fig-tree, [Luk
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#006.md).

(1.) This cursing of the barren fig-tree, represents the state of
hypocrites in general; and so it teaches us, \[1.\] That the fruit of
fig-trees may justly be expected from those that have the leaves. Christ
looks for the power of religion from those that make profession of it;
the favour of it from those that have the show of it; grapes from the
vineyard that is planted in a fruitful hill: he hungers after it, his
soul desires the first ripe fruits. \[2.\] Christ's just expectations
from flourishing professors are often frustrated and disappointed; he
comes to many, seeking fruit, and finds leaves only, and he discovers
it. Many have a name to live, and are not alive indeed; dote on the form
of godliness, and yet deny the power of it. \[3.\] The sin of barrenness
is justly punished with the curse and plague of barrenness; Let no fruit
grow on thee henceforward for ever. As one of the chiefest blessings,
and which was the first, is, Be fruitful; so one of the saddest curses
is, Be no more fruitful. Thus the sin of hypocrites is made their
punishment; they would not do good, and therefore they shall do none; he
that is fruitless, let him be fruitless still, and lose his honour and
comfort. \[4.\] A false and hypocritical profession commonly withers in
this world, and it is the effect of Christ's curse; the fig-tree that
had no fruit, soon lost its leaves. Hypocrites may look plausible for a
time, but, having no principle, no root in themselves, their profession
will soon come to nothing; the gifts wither, common graces decay, the
credit of the profession declines and sinks, and the falseness and folly
of the pretender are manifested to all men.

(2.) It represents the state of the nation and people of the Jews in
particular; they were a fig-tree planted in Christ's way, as a church.
Now observe, \[1.\] The disappointment they gave to our Lord Jesus. He
came among them, expecting to find some fruit, something that would be
pleasing to him; he hungered after it; not that he desired a gift, he
needed it not, but fruit that might abound to a good account. But his
expectations were frustrated; he found nothing but leaves; they called
Abraham their father, but did not do the works of Abraham; they
professed themselves expectants of the promised Messiah, but, when he
came, they did not receive and entertain him. \[2.\] The doom he passed
upon them, that never any fruit should grow upon them or be gathered
from them, as a church or as a people, from henceforward for ever. Never
any good came from them (except the particular persons among them that
believe), after they rejected Christ; they became worse and worse;
blindness and hardness happened to them, and grew upon them, till they
were unchurched, unpeopled, and undone, and their place and nation
rooted up; their beauty was defaced, their privileges and ornaments,
their temple, and priesthood, and sacrifices, and festivals, and all the
glories of their church and state, fell like leaves in autumn. How soon
did their fig-tree wither away, after they said, His blood be on us, and
our children! And the Lord was righteous in it.

2\. See the power of Christ; the former is wrapped up in the figure, but
this more fully discoursed of; Christ intending thereby to direct his
disciples in the use of their powers.

(1.) The disciples admired the effect of Christ's curse ([Mat
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#020).md); They marvelled; no power could
do it but his, who spake, and it was done. They marvelled at the
suddenness of the thing; How soon is the fig-tree withered away! There
was no visible cause of the fig-tree's withering, but it was a secret
blast, a worm at the root; it was not only the leaves of it that
withered, but the body of the tree; it withered away in an instant and
became like a dry stick. Gospel curses are, upon this account, the most
dreadful - that they work insensibly and silently, by a fire not blown,
but effectually.

(2.) Christ empowered them by faith to do the like ([Mat
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#021.md), [Mat
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#022).md); as he said ([Joh
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#012).md), Greater works than these shall
ye do.

Observe, \[1.\] The description of this wonder-working faith; If ye have
faith, and doubt not. Note, Doubting of the power and promise of God is
the great thing that spoils the efficacy and success of faith. "If you
have faith, and dispute not" (so some read it), "dispute not with
yourselves, dispute not with the promise of God; if you stagger not at
the promise" ([Rom 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#020).md); for, as far
as we do so, our faith is deficient; as certain as the promise is, so
confident our faith should be.

\[2.\] The power and prevalence of it expressed figuratively; If ye
shall say to this mountain, meaning the mount of Olives, Be thou
removed, it shall be done. There might be a particular reason for his
saying so of this mountain, for there was a prophecy, that the mount of
Olives, which is before Jerusalem, should cleave in the midst, and then
remove, [Zac 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#004.md). Whatever was the
intent of that word, the same must be the expectation of faith, how
impossible soever it might appear to sense. But this is a proverbial
expression; intimating that we are to believe that nothing is impossible
with God, and therefore that what he has promised shall certainly be
performed, though to us it seem impossible. It was among the Jews a
usual commendation of their learned Rabbin, that they were removers of
mountains, that is, could solve the greatest difficulties; now this may
be done by faith acted on the word of God, which will bring great and
strange things to pass.

\[3.\] The way and means of exercising this faith, and of doing that
which is to be done by it; All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer,
believing, ye shall receive. Faith is the soul, prayer is the body; both
together make a complete man for any service. Faith, if it be right,
will excite prayer; and prayer is not right, if it do not spring from
faith. This is the condition of our receiving - we must ask in prayer,
believing. The requests of prayer shall not be denied; the expectations
of faith shall not be frustrated. We have many promises to this purport
from the mouth of our Lord Jesus, and all to encourage faith, the
principal grace, and prayer, the principal duty, of a Christian. It is
but ask and have, believe and receive; and what would we more? Observe,
How comprehensive the promise is - all things whatsoever ye shall ask;
this is like all and every the premises in a conveyance. All things, in
general; whatsoever, brings it to particulars; though generals include
particulars, yet such is the folly of our unbelief, that, though we
think we assent to promises in the general, yet we fly off when it comes
to particulars, and therefore, that we might have strong consolation, it
is thus copiously expressed, All things whatsoever.

[Matthew 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 21:23</span></span>

Our Lord Jesus (like St. Paul after him) preached his gospel with much
contention; his first appearance was in a dispute with the doctors in
the temple, when he was twelve years old; and here, just before he died,
we have him engaged in controversy. In this sense, he was like Jeremiah,
a man of contention; not striving, but striven with. The great
contenders with him, were, the chief priests and the elders, the judges
of two distinct courts: the chief priests presided in the ecclesiastical
court, in all matters of the Lord, as they are called; the elders of the
people were judges of the civil courts, in temporal matters. See an idea
of both, [Ch2 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#005.md), [Ch2
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#008.md), [Ch2
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#011.md). These joined to attack Christ
thinking they should find or make him obnoxious either to the one or to
the other. See how woefully degenerate that generation was, when the
governors both in church and state, who should have been the great
promoters of the Messiah's kingdom, were the great opposers of it! Here
we have them disturbing him when he was preaching, [Mat
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#023.md). They would neither receive his
instructions themselves, nor let others receive them. Observe,

I. As soon as he came into Jerusalem, he went to the temple, though he
had been affronted there the day before, was there in the midst of
enemies and in the mouth of danger; yet thither he went, for there he
had a fairer opportunity of doing good to souls than any where else in
Jerusalem. Though he came hungry to the city, and was disappointed of a
breakfast at the barren fig-tree, yet, for aught that appears, he went
straight to the temple, as one that esteemed the words of God's mouth,
the preaching of them, more than his necessary food.

II\. In the temple he was teaching; he had called it a house of prayer
([Mat 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#013).md), and here we have him
preaching there. Note, In the solemn assemblies of Christians, praying
and preaching must go together, and neither must encroach upon, or
jostle out, the other. To make up communion with God, we must not only
speak to him in prayer, but hear what he has to say to us by his word;
ministers must give themselves both to the word and to prayer, [Act
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#004.md). Now that Christ taught in the
temple, that scripture was fulfilled ([Isa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003).md), Let us go up to the house of the
Lord, and he will teach us his ways. The priests of old often taught
there the good knowledge of the Lord; but they never had such a teacher
as this.

III\. When Christ was teaching the people, the priests and elders came
upon him, and challenged him to produce his orders; the hand of Satan
was in this, to hinder him in his work. Note, It cannot but be a trouble
to a faithful minister, to be taken off, or diverted fRom. plain and
practical preaching, by an unavoidable necessity of engaging in
controversies, yet good was brought out of this evil, for hereby
occasion was given to Christ to dispel the objections that were advanced
against him, to the greater satisfaction of his followers; and, while
his adversaries thought by their power to have silenced him, he by his
wisdom silenced them.

Now, in this dispute with them, we may observe,

1\. How he was assaulted by their insolent demand; By what authority
doest thou these things, and who gave thee this authority? Had they duly
considered his miracles, and the power by which he wrought them, they
needed not to have asked this question; but they must have something to
say for the shelter of an obstinate infidelity. "Thou ridest in triumph
into Jerusalem, receivest the hosannas of the people, controllest in the
temple, drivest out such as had license to be there, from the rulers of
the temple, and paid them rent; thou are here preaching a new doctrine;
whence hadst thou a commission to do all this? Was it from Caesar, or
from the high priest, or from God? Produce thy warrant, thy credentials.
Dost not thou take too much upon thee?" Note, It is good for all that
take upon them to act with authority, to put this question to
themselves, "Who gave us that authority?" For, unless a man be clear in
his own conscience concerning that, he cannot act with any comfort or
hope of success. They who run before their warrant, run without their
blessing, [Jer 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#021.md), [Jer
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#022.md).

Christ had often said it, and proved it beyond contradiction, and
Nicodemus, a master in Israel, had owned it, that he was a teacher sent
of God ([Joh 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#002).md); yet, at this time
of day, when that point had been so fully cleared and settled, they come
to him with this question. (1.) In the ostentation of their own power,
as chief priests and elders, which they thought authorized them to call
him to an account in this manner. How haughtily do they ask, Who gave
thee this authority? Intimating that he could have no authority, because
he had none from them, [Kg1 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#024.md);
[Jer 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001.md). Note, It is common for the
greatest abusers of their power to be the most rigorous assertors of it,
and to take a pride and pleasure in any thing that looks like the
exercise of it. (2.) It was to ensnare and entangle him. Should he
refuse to answer this question, they would enter judgment against him
upon Nihil dicit - He says nothing; would condemn him as standing mute;
and would insinuate to the people, that his silence was a tacit
confessing of himself to be a usurper: should he plead an authority from
God, they would, as formerly, demand a sign from heaven, or make his
defence his offence, and accuse him of blasphemy for it.

2\. How he answered this demand with another, which would help them to
answer it themselves ([Mat 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#024.md), [Mat
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#025).md); I also will ask you one thing.
He declined giving them a direct answer, lest they should take advantage
against him; but answers them with a question. Those that are as sheep
in the midst of wolves, have need to be wise as serpents: the heart of
the wise studieth to answer. We must give a reason of the hope that is
in us, not only with meekness, but with fear ([Pe1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#015).md), with prudent caution, lest
truth be damaged, or ourselves endangered.

Now this question is concerning John's baptism, here put for his whole
ministry, preaching as well as baptizing; "Was this from heaven, or of
men? One of the two it must be; either what he did was of his own head,
or he was sent of God to do it." Gamaliel's argument turned upon this
hinge ([Act 5:38](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#038.md), [Act
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#039).md); either this counsel is of men
or of God. Though that which is manifestly bad cannot be of God, yet
that which is seemingly good may be of men, nay of Satan, when he
transforms himself into an angel of light. This question was not at all
shuffling, to evade theirs; but,

(1.) If they answered this question, it would answer theirs: should they
say, against their consciences, that John's baptism was of men, yet it
would be easy to answer, John did no miracle ([Joh
10:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#041).md), Christ did many; but should
they say, as they could not but own, that John's baptism was from heaven
(which was supposed in the questions sent him, [Joh
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#021.md), Art thou Elias, or that
prophet?) then their demand was answered, for he bare testimony to
Christ. Note, Truths appear in the clearest light when they are taken in
their due order; the resolving of the previous questions will be a key
to the main question.

(2.) If they refused to answer it, that would be a good reason why he
should not offer proofs of his authority to men that were obstinately
prejudiced against the strongest conviction; it was but to cast pearls
before swine. Thus he taketh the wise in their own craftiness ([Co1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#019).md); and those that would not be
convinced of the plainest truths, shall be convicted of the vilest
malice, against John first, then against Christ, and in both against
God.

3\. How they were hereby baffled and run aground; they knew the truth,
but would not own it, and so were taken in the snare they laid for our
Lord Jesus. Observe,

(1.) How they reasoned with themselves, not concerning the merits of the
cause, what proofs there were of the divine original of John's baptism;
no, their care was, how to make their part good against Christ. Two
things they considered and consulted, in this reasoning with themselves
- their credit, and their safety; the same things which they principally
aim at, who seek their own things.

\[1.\] They consider their own credit, which they would endanger if they
should own John's baptism to be of God; for then Christ would ask them,
before all the people. Why did ye not believe him? And to acknowledge
that a doctrine is from God, and yet not to receive and entertain it, is
the greatest absurdity and iniquity that a man can be charged with. Many
that will not be kept by the fear of sin from neglecting and opposing
that which they know to be true and good are kept by the fear of shame
from owning that to be true and good which they neglect and oppose. Thus
they reject the counsel of God against themselves, in not submitting to
John's baptism, and are left without excuse.

\[2.\] They consider their own safety, that they would expose themselves
to the resentments of the people, if they should say that John's baptism
was of men; We fear the people, for all hold John as a prophet. It
seems, then, First, That the people had truer sentiments of John than
the chief priests and the elders had, or, at least, were more free and
faithful in declaring their sentiments. This people, of whom they said
in their pride that they knew not the law, and were cursed ([Joh
7:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#049).md), it seems, knew the gospel, and
were blessed. Secondly, That the chief priests and elders stood in awe
of the common people, which is an evidence that things were in disorder
among them, and that mutual jealousies were at a great height; that the
government was become obnoxious to the hatred and scorn of the people,
and the scripture was fulfilled, I have made you contemptible and base,
[Mal 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#008.md), [Mal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#009.md). If they had kept their integrity,
and done their duty, they had kept up their authority, and needed not to
fear the people. We find sometimes that the people feared them, and it
served them for a reason why they did not confess Christ, [Joh
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#022.md), [Joh
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#042.md). Note, Those could not but fear
the people, who studied only how to make the people fear them. Thirdly,
That it is usually the temper even of common people to be zealous for
the honour of that which they account sacred and divine. If they account
John as a prophet, they will not endure that it should be said, His
baptism was of men; hence the hottest contests have been about holy
things. Fourthly, That the chief priests and elders were kept from an
open denial of the truth, even against the conviction of their own
minds, not by the fear of God, but purely by the fear of the people; as
the fear of man may bring good people into a snare ([Pro
29:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#025).md), so sometimes it may keep bad
people from being overmuch wicked, lest they should die before their
time, [Ecc 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#017.md). Many bad people would
be much worse than they are, if they durst.

(2.) How they replied to our Saviour, and so dropped the question. They
fairly confessed We cannot tell; that is, "We will not;" ouk oi damen -
We never knew. The more shame for them, while they pretended to be
leaders of the people, and by their office were obliged to take
cognizance of such things; when they would not confess their knowledge,
they were constrained to confess their ignorance. And observe, by the
way, when they said, We cannot tell, they told a lie, for they knew that
John's baptism was of God. Note, There are many who are more afraid of
the shame of lying than of the sin, and therefore scruple not to speak
that which they know to be false concerning their own thoughts and
apprehensions, their affections and intentions, or their remembering or
forgetting of things, because in those things they know nobody can
disprove them.

Thus Christ avoided the snare they laid for him, and justified himself
in refusing to gratify them; Neither tell I you by what authority I do
these things. If they be so wicked and base as either not to believe, or
not to confess, that the baptism of John was from heaven (though it
obliged to repentance, that great duty, and sealed the kingdom of God at
hand, that great promise), they were not fit to be discoursed with
concerning Christ's authority; for men of such a disposition could not
be convinced of the truth, nay, they could not but be provoked by it,
and therefore he that is thus ignorant, let him be ignorant still. Note,
Those that imprison the truths they know, in unrighteousness (either by
not professing them, or by not practising according to them), are justly
denied the further truths they enquire after, [Rom
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018.md), [Rom
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#019.md). Take away the talent from him
that buried it; those that will not see, shall not see.

[Matthew 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 21:28</span></span>

As Christ instructed his disciples by parables, which made the
instructions the more easy, so sometimes he convinced his adversaries by
parables, which bring reproofs more close, and make men, or ever they
are aware, to reprove themselves. Thus Nathan convinced David by a
parable ([Sa2 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#001).md), and the woman of
Tekoa surprised him in like manner, [Sa2
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#002.md) : Reproving parables are appeals
to the offenders themselves, and judge them out of their own mouths.
This Christ designs here, as appears by the first words ([Mat
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#028).md), But what think you?

In these verses we have the parable of the two sons sent to work in the
vineyard, the scope of which is to show that they who knew not John's
baptism to be of God, were shamed even by the publicans and harlots, who
knew it, and owned it. Here is,

I. The parable itself, which represents two sorts of persons; some that
prove better than they promise, represented by the first of those sons;
others that promise better than they prove represented by the second.

1\. They had both one and the same father, which signifies that God is a
common Father to all mankind. There are favours which all alike receive
from him, and obligations which all alike lie under to him; Have we not
all one Father? Yes, and yet there is a vast difference between men's
characters.

2\. They had both the same command given them; Son, go work today in my
vineyard. Parents should not breed up their children in idleness;
nothing is more pleasing, and yet nothing more pernicious, to youth than
that. [Lam 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#027.md). God sets his children
to work, though they are all heirs. This command is given to every one
of us. Note, (1.) The work of religion, which we are called to engage
in, is vineyard work, creditable, profitable, and pleasant. By the sin
of Adam we were turned out to work upon the common, and to eat the herb
of the field; but by the grace of our Lord Jesus we are called to work
again in the vineyard. (2.) The gospel call to work in the vineyard,
requires present obedience; Son, go work today, while it is called
today, because the night comes when no man can work. We were not sent
into the world to be idle, nor had we daylight given us to play by; and
therefore, if ever we mean to do any thing for God and our souls, why
not now? Why not today? (3.) The exhortation to go work today in the
vineyard, speaketh unto us as unto children ([Heb
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#005).md); Son, go work. It is the command
of a Father, which carries with it both authority and affection, a
Father that pities his children, and considers their frame, and will not
overtask them ([Psa 103:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#013.md), [Psa
103:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#014).md), a Father that is very tender
of his Son that serves him, [Mal 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#017.md).
If we work in our Father's vineyard, we work for ourselves.

3\. Their conduct was very different.

(1.) One of the sons did better than he said, proved better than he
promised. His answer was bad, but his actions were good.

\[1.\] Here is the untoward answer that he gave to his father; he said,
flat and plain I will not. See to what a degree of impudence the corrupt
nature of man rises, to say, I will not, to the command of a Father;
such a command of such a Father; they are impudent children, and
stiff-hearted. Those that will not bend, surely they cannot blush; if
they had any degree of modesty left them, they could not say, We will
not. [Jer 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#025.md). Excuses are bad, but
downright denials are worse; yet such peremptory refusals do the calls
of the gospel often meet with. First, Some love their ease, and will not
work; they would live in the world as leviathan in the waters, to play
therein ([Psa 104:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#026).md); they do not
love working. Secondly, Their hearts are so much upon their own fields,
that they are not for working in God's vineyard. They love the business
of the world better than the business of their religion. Thus some by
the delights of sense, and others by the employments of the world, are
kept from doing that great work which they were sent into the world
about, and so stand all the day idle.

\[2.\] Here is the happy change of his mind, and of his way, upon second
thought; Afterward he repented, and went. Note, There are many who in
the beginning are wicked and wilful, and very unpromising, who afterward
repent and mend, and come to something. Some that God hath chosen, are
suffered for a great while to run to a great excess of riot; Such were
some of you, [Co1 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011.md). These are set
forth for patterns of long-suffering, [Ti1
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#016.md). Afterward he repented.
Repentance is metanoia - an after-wit: and metameleia - an after-care.
Better late than never. Observe, When he repented he went; that was the
fruit meet for repentance. The only evidence of our repentance for our
former resistance, is, immediately to comply, and set to work; and then
what is past, shall be pardoned, and all shall be well. See what a kind
Father God is; he resents not the affront of our refusals, as justly he
might. He that told his father to his face, that he would not do as he
bid him, deserved to be turned out of doors, and disinherited; but our
God waits to be gracious, and, not withstanding our former follies, if
we repent and mend, will favourably accept of us; blessed be God, we are
under a covenant that leaves room for such a repentance.

(2.) The other son said better than he did, promised better than he
proved; his answer was good but his actions bad. To him the father said
likewise, [Mat 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#030.md). The gospel call,
though very different, is, in effect, the same to all, and is carried on
with an even tenour. We have all the same commands, engagements,
encouragements, though to some they are a savour of life unto life, to
others of death unto death. Observe,

\[1.\] How fairly this other son promised; He said, I go, sir. He gives
his father a title of respect, sir. Note, It becomes children to speak
respectfully to their parents. It is one branch of that honour which the
fifth commandment requires. He professes a ready obedience, I go; not,
"I will go by and by," but, "Ready, sir, you may depend upon it, I go
just now." This answer we should give from the heart heartily to all the
calls and commands of the word of God. See [Jer
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#022.md); [Psa
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#008.md).

\[2.\] How he failed in the performance; He went not. Note, There are
many that give good words, and make fair promises, in religion, and
those from some good motions for the present, that rest there, and go no
further, and so come to nothing. Saying and doing are two things; and
many there are that say, and do not; it is particularly charged upon the
Pharisees, [Mat 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#003.md). Many with their
mouth show much love, but their heart goes another way. They had a good
mind to be religious, but they met with something to be done, that was
too hard, or something to be parted with, that was too dear, and so
their purposes are to no purpose. Buds and blossoms are not fruit.

II\. A general appeal upon the parable; Whether of them twain did the
will of his father? [Mat 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#031.md). They
both had their faults, one was rude and the other was false, such
variety of exercises parents sometimes have in the different humours of
their children, and they have need of a great deal of wisdom and grace
to know what is the best way of managing them. But the question is,
Which was the better of the two, and the less faulty? And it was soon
resolved; the first, because his actions were better than his words, and
his latter end than his beginning. This they had learned from the common
sense of mankind, who would much rather deal with one that will be
better than his word, than with one that will be false to his word. And,
in the intention of it, they had learned from the account God gives of
the rule of his judgment ([Eze
18:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#021).md), that if the sinner turn
from his wickedness, he shall be pardoned; and if the righteous man turn
from his righteousness, he shall be rejected. The tenour of the whole
scripture gives us to understand that those are accepted as doing their
Father's will, who, wherein they have missed it, are sorry for it, and
do better.

III\. A particular application of it to the matter in hand, [Mat
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#031.md), [Mat
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#032.md). The primary scope of the
parable is, to show how the publicans and harlots, who never talked of
the Messiah and his kingdom, yet entertained the doctrine, and submitted
to the discipline, of John the Baptist, his forerunner, when the priests
and elders, who were big with expectations of the Messiah, and seemed
very ready to go into his measures, slighted John the Baptist, and ran
counter to the designs of his mission. But it has a further reach; the
Gentiles were sometimes disobedient, had been long so, children of
disobedience, like the elder son ([Tit
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#003.md), [Tit
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#004).md); yet, when the gospel was
preached to them, they became obedient to the faith; whereas the Jews
who said, I go, sir, promised fair ([Exo
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#007.md); [Jos
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#024).md); yet went not; they did but
flatter God with their mouth. [Psa
78:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#036.md).

In Christ's application of this parable, observe.

1\. How he proves that John's baptism was from heaven, and not of men.
"If you cannot tell," saith Christ, "you might tell,"

(1.) By the scope of his ministry; John came unto you in the way of
righteousness. Would you know whether John had his commission from
heaven, remember the rule of trial, By their fruits ye shall know them;
the fruits of their doctrines, the fruits of their doings. Observe but
their way, and you may trace out both their rise and their tendency. Now
it was evident that John came in the way of righteousness. In his
ministry, he taught people to repent, and to work the works of
righteousness. In his conversation, he was a great example of
strictness, and seriousness, and contempt of the world, denying himself,
and doing good to every body else. Christ therefore submitted to the
baptism of John, because it became him to fulfil all righteousness. Now,
if John thus came in the way of righteousness, could they be ignorant
that his baptism was from heaven, or make any doubt of it?

(2.) By the success of his ministry; The publicans and the harlots
believed him; he did abundance of good among the worst sort of people.
St. Paul proves his apostleship by the seals of his ministry, [Co1
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#002.md). If God had not sent John the
Baptist, he would not have crowned his labours with such wonderful
success, nor have made him so instrumental as he was for the conversion
f souls. If publicans and harlots believe his report, surely the arm of
the Lord is with him. The people's profiting is the minister's best
testimonial.

2\. How he reproves them for their contempt of John's baptism, which
yet, for fear of the people, they were not willing to own. To shame them
for it, he sets before them the faith, repentance, and obedience, of the
publicans and harlots, which aggravated their unbelief and impenitence.
As he shows, [Mat 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#021.md), that the less
likely would have repented, so here that the less likely did repent.

(1.) The publicans and harlots were like the first son in the parable,
from whom little of religion was expected. They promised little good,
and those that knew them promised themselves little good from them.
Their disposition was generally rude, and their conversation profligate
and debauched; and yet many of them were wrought upon the by the
ministry of John, who came in the spirit and power of Elias. See [Luk
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#029.md). These fitly represented the
Gentile world; for, as Dr. Whitby observes, the Jews generally ranked
the publicans with the heathen; nay, and the heathen were represented by
the Jews as harlots, and born of harlots, [Joh
8:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#041.md).

(2.) The scribes and Pharisees, the chief priests and elders, and indeed
the Jewish nation in general, were like the other son that gave good
words; they made a specious profession of religion, and yet, when the
kingdom of the Messiah was brought among them by the baptism of John,
they slighted it, they turned their back upon it, nay they lifted up the
heel against it. A hypocrite is more hardly convinced and converted than
a gross sinner; the form of godliness, if that be rested in, becomes one
of Satan's strongholds, by which he opposes the power of godliness. It
was an aggravation of their unbelief, \[1.\] That John was such an
excellent person, that he came, and came to them, in the way of
righteousness. The better the means are, the greater will the account
be, if not improved. \[2.\] That, when they saw the publicans and
harlots go before them into the kingdom of heaven, they did not
afterward repent and believe; were not thereby provoked to a holy
emulation, [Rom 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#014.md). Shall publicans
and harlots go away with grace and glory; and shall not we put in for a
share? Shall our inferiors be more holy and more happy than we? They had
not the wit and grace that Esau had, who was moved to take other
measures than he had done, by the example of his younger brother, [Gen
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#006.md). These proud priests, that set up
for leaders, scorned to follow, though it were into the kingdom of
heaven, especially to follow publicans; through the pride of their
countenance, they would not seek after God, after Christ, [Psa
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#004.md).

[Matthew 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mat 21:33</span></span>

This parable plainly sets forth the sin and ruin of the Jewish nation;
they and their leaders are the husbandmen here; and what is spoken for
conviction to them, is spoken for caution to all that enjoy the
privileges of the visible church, not to be high-minded, but fear.

I. We have here the privileges of the Jewish church, represented by the
letting out of a vineyard to the husbandmen; they were as tenants
holding by, fRom. and under, God the great Householder. Observe,

1\. How God established a church for himself in the world. The kingdom
of God upon earth is here compared to a vineyard, furnished with all
things requisite to an advantageous management and improvement of it.
(1.) He planted this vineyard. The church is the planting of the Lord,
[Isa 61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003.md). The forming of a church is
a work by itself, like the planting of a vineyard, which requires a
great deal of cost and care. It is the vineyard which his right hand has
planted ([Psa 80:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#015).md), planted with the
choicest vine ([Isa 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002).md), a noble
vine, [Jer 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021.md). The earth of itself
produces thorns and briars; but vines must be planted. The being of a
church is owing to God's distinguishing favour, and his manifesting
himself to some, and not to others. (2.) He hedged it round about. Note,
God's church in the world is taken under his special protection. It is a
hedge round about, like that about Job on every side ([Job
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#010).md), a wall of fire, [Zac
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005.md). Wherever God has a church, it is,
and will always be, his peculiar care. The covenant of circumcision and
the ceremonial law were a hedge or a wall of partition about the Jewish
church, which is taken down by Christ; who yet has appointed a gospel
order and discipline to be the hedge of his church. He will not have his
vineyard to lie in common, that those who are without, may thrust in at
pleasure; not to lie at large, that those who are within, may lash out
at pleasure; but care is taken to set bounds about this holy mountain.
(3.) He digged a wine-press and built a tower. The altar of
burnt-offerings was the wine-press, to which all the offerings were
brought. God instituted ordinances in his church, for the due oversight
of it, and for the promoting of its fruitfulness. What could have been
done more to make it every way convenient?

2\. How he entrusted these visible church-privileges with the nation and
people of the Jews, especially their chief priests and elders; he let it
out to them as husbandmen, not because he had need of them as landlords
have of their tenants, but because he would try them, and be honoured by
them. When in Judah God was known, and his name was great, when they
were taken to be to God for a people, and for a name, and for a praise
([Jer 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#011).md), when he revealed his
word unto Jacob ([Psa 147:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#019).md), when
the covenant of life and peace was made with Levi ([Mal
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#004.md), [Mal
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#005).md), then this vineyard was let out.
See an abstract of the lease, [Sol
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#011.md), [Sol
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#012.md). The Lord of the vineyard was to
have a thousand pieces of silver (compare [Isa
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#013).md); the main profit was to be his,
but the keepers were to have two hundred, a competent and comfortable
encouragement. And then he went into a far country. When God had in a
visible appearance settled the Jewish church at mount Sinai, he did in a
manner withdraw; they had no more such open vision, but were left to the
written word. Or, they imagined that he was gone into a far country, as
Israel, when they made the calf, fancied that Moses was gone. They put
far from them the evil day.

II\. God's expectation of rent from these husbandmen, [Mat
21:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#034.md). It was a reasonable
expectation; for who plants a vineyard, and eats not of the fruit
thereof? Note, From those that enjoy church-privileges, both ministers
and people, God looks for fruit accordingly. 1. His expectations were
not hasty; he did not demand a fore-rent, though he had been at such
expense upon it; but staid till the time of the fruit drew near, as it
did now that John preached the kingdom of heaven is at hand. God waits
to be gracious, that he may give us time. 2. They were not high; he did
not require them to come at their peril, upon penalty of forfeiting
their lease if they ran behind-hand; but he sent his servants to them,
to remind them of their duty, and of the rent-day, and to help them in
gathering in the fruit, and making return of it. These servants were the
prophets of the Old Testament, who were sent, and sometimes directly, to
the people of the Jews, to reprove and instruct them. 3. They were not
hard; it was only to receive the fruits. He did not demand more than
they could make of it, but some fruit of that which he himself planted -
an observance of the laws and statutes he gave them. What could have
been done more reasonable? Israel was an empty vine, nay it was become
the degenerate plant of a strange vine, and brought forth wild grapes.

III\. The husbandmen's baseness in abusing the messengers that were sent
to them.

1\. When he sent them his servants, they abused them, though they
represented the master himself, and spoke in his name. Note, The calls
and reproofs of the word, if they do not engage, will but exasperate.
See here what hath all along been the lot of God's faithful messengers,
more or less; (1.) To suffer; so persecuted they the prophets, who were
hated with a cruel hatred. They not only despised and reproached them,
but treated them as the worst of malefactors - they beat them, and
killed them, and stoned them. They beat Jeremiah, killed Isaiah, stoned
Zechariah the son of Jehoiada in the temple. If they that live godly in
Christ Jesus themselves shall suffer persecution, much more they that
press others to it. This was God's old quarrel with the Jews, misusing
his prophets, [Ch2 36:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#016). (2..md) It has
been their lot to suffer from their Master's own tenants; they were the
husbandmen that treated them thus, the chief priests and elders that sat
in Moses's chair, that professed religion and relation to God; these
were the most bitter enemies of the Lord's prophets, that cast them out,
and killed them, and said, Let the Lord be glorified, [Isa
66:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005.md) See [Jer
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001.md), [Jer
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#002.md); [Jer
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#011.md).

Now see, \[1.\] How God persevered in his goodness to them. He sent
other servants, more than the first; though the first sped not, but were
abused. He had sent them John the Baptist, and him they had beheaded;
and yet he sent them his disciples, to prepare his way. O the riches of
the patience and forbearance of God, in keeping up in his church a
despised, persecuted ministry! \[2.\] How they persisted in their
wickedness. They did unto them likewise. One sin makes way for another
of the same kind. They that are drunk with the blood of the saints, add
drunkenness to thirst, and still cry, Give, give.

2\. At length, he sent them his Son; we have seen God's goodness in
sending, and their badness in abusing, the servants; but in the latter
instance both these exceed themselves.

(1.) Never did grace appear more gracious than in sending the Son. This
was done last of all. Note, All the prophets were harbingers and
forerunners to Christ. He was sent last; for if nothing else would work
upon them, surely this would; it was therefore served for the ratio
ultima - the last expedient. Surely they will reverence my Son, and
therefore I will send him. Note, It might reasonably be expected that
the Son of God, when he came to his own, should be reverenced; and
reverence to Christ would be a powerful and effectual principle of
fruitfulness and obedience, to the glory of God; if they will but
reverence the Son, the point is gained. Surely they will reverence my
Son, for he comes with more authority than the servants could; judgment
is committed to him, that all men should honour him. There is greater
danger in refusing him than in despising Moses's law.

(2.) Never did sin appear more sinful than in the abusing of him, which
was now to be done in two or three days. Observe,

\[1.\] How it was plotted ([Mat
21:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#038).md); When they saw the Son: when he
came, whom the people owned and followed as the Messiah, who would
either have the rent paid, or distrain for it; this touched their
copyhold, and they were resolved to make one bold push for it, and to
preserve their wealth and grandeur by taking him out of the way, who was
the only hindrance to it, and rival with them. This is the heir, come,
let us kill him. Pilate and Herod, the princes of this world, knew not;
for if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory,
[Co1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008.md). But the chief priests and
elders knew that this was the heir, at least some of them; and therefore
Come, let us kill him. Many are killed for what they have. The chief
thing they envied him, and for which they hated and feared him, was his
interest in the people, and their hosannas, which, if he was taken off,
they hope to engross securely to themselves. They pretended that he must
die, to save the people from the Romans ([Joh
11:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#050).md); but really he must die, to
save their hypocrisy and tyranny from that reformation which the
expected kingdom of the Messiah would certainly bring along with it. He
drives the buyers and sellers out of the temple; and therefore let us
kill him; and then, as if the premises must of course go to the
occupant, let us seize on his inheritance. They thought, if they could
but get rid of this Jesus, they should carry all before them in the
church without control, might impose what traditions, and force the
people to what submissions, they pleased. Thus they take counsel against
the Lord and his Anointed; but he that sits in heaven, laughs to see
them outshot in their own bow; for, while they thought to kill him, and
so to seize on his inheritance, he went by his cross to his crown, and
they were broken pieces with a rod of iron, and their inheritance
seized. [Psa 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#002.md), [Psa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#003.md), [Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md), [Psa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009.md).

\[2.\] How this plot was executed, [Mat
21:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#039.md). While they were so set upon
killing him, in pursuance of their design to secure their own pomp and
power, and while he was so set upon dying, in pursuance of his design to
subdue Satan, and save his chosen, no wonder if they soon caught him,
and slew him, when his hour was come. Though the Roman power condemned
him, yet it is still charged upon the chief priests and elders; for they
were not only the prosecutors, but the principal agents, and had the
greater sin. Ye have taken, [Act 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#023.md).
Nay looking upon him to be as unworthy to live, as they were unwilling
he should, they cast him out of the vineyard, out of the holy church,
which they supposed themselves to have the key of, and out of the holy
city for he was crucified without the gate, [Heb
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#012.md). As if He had been the shame and
reproach, who was the greatest glory of his people Israel. Thus they who
persecuted the servants, persecuted the Son; as men treat God's
ministers, they would treat Christ himself, if he were with them.

IV\. Here is their doom read out of their own mouths, [Mat
21:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#040.md), [Mat
21:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#041.md). He puts it to them, When the
Lord of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto these husbandmen? He
puts it to themselves, for their stronger conviction, that knowing the
judgment of God against them which do such things, they might be the
more inexcusable. Note, God's proceedings are so unexceptionable, that
there needs but an appeal to sinners themselves concerning the equity of
them. God will be justified when he speaks. They could readily answer,
He will miserably destroy those wicked men. Note, Many can easily
prognosticate the dismal consequences of other people's sins, that see
not what will be the end of their own.

1\. Our Saviour, in his question, supposes that the lord of the vineyard
will come, and reckon with them. God is the Lord of the vineyard; the
property is his, and he will make them know it, who now lord it over his
heritage, as if it were all their own. The Lord of the vineyard will
come. Persecutors say in their hearts, He delays his coming, he doth not
see, he will not require; but they shall find, though he bear long with
them, he will not bear always. It is comfort to abused saints and
ministers, that the Lord is at hand, the Judge stands before the door.
When he comes, what will he do to carnal professors? What will he do to
cruel persecutors? They must be called to account, they have their day
now; but he sees that his day is coming.

2\. They, in their answer, suppose that it will be a terrible reckoning;
the crime appearing so very black, you may be sure,

(1.) That he will miserably destroy those wicked men; it is destruction
that is their doom. Kakous kakōs apolesei - Malos male perdet. Let men
never expect to do ill, and fare well. This was fulfilled upon the Jews,
in that miserable destruction which was brought upon them by the Romans,
and was completed about forty years after this; and unparalleled ruin,
attended with all the most dismal aggravating circumstances. It will be
fulfilled upon all that tread in the steps of their wickedness; hell is
everlasting destruction, and it will be the most miserable destruction
to them of all others, that have enjoyed the greatest share of church
privileges, and have not improved them. The hottest place in hell will
be the portion of hypocrites and persecutors.

(2.) That he will let out his vineyard to other husbandmen. Note, God
will have a church in the world, notwithstanding the unworthiness and
opposition of many that abuse the privileges of it. The unbelief and
frowardness of man shall not make the word of God of no effect. If one
will not, another will. The Jews' leavings were the Gentiles' feast.
Persecutors may destroy the ministers, but cannot destroy the church.
The Jews imagined that no doubt they were the people, and wisdom and
holiness must die with them; and if they were cut off, what would God do
for a church in the world? But when God makes use of any to bear up his
name, it is not because he needs them, nor is he at all beholden to
them. If we were made a desolation and an astonishment, God could build
a flourishing church upon our ruins; for he is never at a loss what to
do for his great name, whatever becomes of us, and of our place and
nation.

V. The further illustration and application of this by Christ himself,
telling them, in effect, that they had rightly judged.

1\. He illustrates it by referring to a scripture fulfilled in this
([Mat 21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042).md); Did ye never read in the
scriptures? Yes, no doubt, they had often read and sung it, but had not
considered it. We lose the benefit of what we read for want of
meditation. The scripture he quotes is [Psa
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md), [Psa
118:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#023.md), the same context out of which
the children fetched their hosannas. The same word yields matter of
praise and comfort to Christ's friends and followers, which speaks
conviction and terror to his enemies. Such a two-edged sword is the word
of God. That scripture, the Stone which the builders refused is become
the headstone of the corner, illustrates the preceding parable,
especially that part of it which refers to Christ.

(1.) The builders' rejecting of the stone is the same with the
husbandmen's abusing of the son that was sent to them. The chief priests
and the elders were the builders, had the oversight of the Jewish
church, which was God's building: and they would not allow Christ a
place in their building, would not admit his doctrine or laws into their
constitution; they threw him aside as a despised broken vessel, a stone
that would serve only for a stepping-stone, to be trampled upon.

(2.) The advancing of this stone to be the head of the corner is the
same with letting out the vineyard to other husbandmen. He who was
rejected by the Jews was embraced by the Gentiles; and to that church
where there is no difference of circumcision or uncircumcision, Christ
is all, and in all. His authority over the gospel church, and influence
upon it, his ruling it as the Head, and uniting it as the Corner-stone,
are the great tokens of his exhaltation. Thus, in spite of the malice of
the priests and elders, he divided a portion with the great, and
received his kingdom, though they would not have him to reign over them.

(3.) The hand of God was in all this; This is the Lord's doing. Even the
rejecting of him by the Jewish builders was by the determinate counsel
and foreknowledge of God; he permitted and overruled it; much more was
his advancement to the Head of the corner; his right hand and his holy
arm brought it about; it was God himself that highly exalted him, and
gave him a name above every name; and it is marvellous in our eyes. The
wickedness of the Jews that rejected him is marvellous,; that men should
be so prejudiced against their own interest! See [Isa
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#009.md), [Isa
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#010.md), [Isa
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#014.md). The honour done him by the
Gentile world, notwithstanding the abuses done him by his own people, is
marvellous; that he whom men despised and abhorred, should be adored by
kings! [Isa 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007.md). But it is the Lord's
doing.

2\. He applies it to them, and application is the life of preaching.

(1.) He applies the sentence which they had passed ([Mat
21:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#041).md), and turns it upon themselves;
not the former part of it, concerning the miserable destruction of the
husbandmen (he could not bear to speak of that), but the latter part, of
letting out the vineyard to others; because though it looked black upon
the Jews, it spoke good to the Gentiles. Know then,

\[1.\] That the Jews shall be unchurched; The kingdom of God shall be
taken from you. This turning out of the husbandmen speaks the same doom
with that of dismantling the vineyard, and laying it common. [Isa
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#005.md). To the Jews had long pertained
the adoption and the glory ([Rom 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004).md);
to them were committed the oracles of God ([Rom
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#002).md), and the sacred trust of revealed
religion, and bearing up of God's name in the world ([Psa
76:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md), [Psa
76:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#002).md); but now it shall be so no
longer. They were not only unfruitful in the use of their privileges,
but, under pretence of them, opposed the gospel of Christ, and so
forfeited them, and it was not long ere the forfeiture was taken. Note,
It is a righteous thing with God to remove church privileges from those
that not only sin against them, but sin with them, [Rev
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#004.md), [Rev
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#005.md). The kingdom of God was taken from
the Jews, not only by the temporal judgments that befell them, but by
the spiritual judgments they lay under, their blindness of mind,
hardness of heart, and indignation at the gospel, [Rom
11:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#008.md); [Th1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#015.md).

\[2.\] That the Gentiles shall be taken in. God needs not ask us leave
whether he shall have a church in the world; though his vine be plucked
up in one place, he will find another to plant it in. He will give it
ethnei - to the Gentile world, that will bring forth the fruit of it.
They who had been not a people, and had not obtained mercy, became
favourites of Heaven. This is the mystery which blessed Paul was so much
affected with ([Rom 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#030.md), [Rom
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033).md), and which the Jews were so
much affronted by, [Act 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#021.md), [Act
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#022.md). At the first planting of Israel
in Canaan, the fall of the Gentiles was the riches of Israel ([Psa
135:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#010.md), [Psa
135:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#011).md), so, at their extirpation, the
fall of Israel was the riches of the Gentiles, [Rom
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012.md). It shall go to a nation
bringing forth the fruits thereof. Note, Christ knows beforehand who
will bring forth gospel fruits in the use of gospel means; because our
fruitfulness is all the work of his own hands, and known unto God are
all his works. They shall bring forth the fruits better than the Jews
had done; God has had more glory from the New Testament church than from
that of the Old Testament; for, when he changes, it shall not be to his
loss.

(2.) He applies the scripture which he had quoted ([Mat
21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042).md), to their terror, [Mat
21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044.md). This Stone, which the builders
refused, is set for the fall of many in Israel; and we have here the
doom of two sorts of people, for whose fall it proves that Christ is
set.

\[1.\] Some, through ignorance, stumble at Christ in his estate of
humiliation; when this Stone lies on the earth, where the builders threw
it, they, through their blindness and carelessness, fall on it, fall
over it, and they shall be broken. The offence they take at Christ, will
not hurt him, any more than he that stumbles, hurts the stone he
stumbles at; but it will hurt themselves; they will fall, and be broken,
and snared, [Isa 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md); [Pe1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007.md), [Pe1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#008.md). The unbelief of sinners will be
their ruin.

\[2.\] Others, through malice, oppose Christ, and bid defiance to him in
his estate of exaltation, when this Stone is advanced to the head of the
corner; and on them it shall fall, for they pull it on their own heads,
as the Jews did by that challenge, His blood be upon us and upon our
children, and it will grind them to powder. The former seems to bespeak
the sin and ruin of all unbelievers; this is the greater sin, and sorer
ruin, of persecutors, that kick against the pricks, and persist in it.
Christ's kingdom will be a burthensome stone to all those that attempt
to overthrow it, or heave it out of its place; see [Zac
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#003.md). This Stone cut out of the
mountain without hands, will break in pieces all opposing power, [Dan
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034.md), [Dan
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#035.md). Some make this an allusion to
the manner of stoning to death among the Jews. The malefactors were
first thrown down violently from a high scaffold upon a great stone,
which would much bruise them; but then they threw another great stone
upon them, which would crush them to pieces: one way or other, Christ
will utterly destroy all those that fight against him. If they be so
stout-hearted, that they are not destroyed by falling on this stone, yet
it shall fall on them, and so destroy them. He will strike through
kings, he will fill the places with dead bodies, [Psa
110:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#005.md), [Psa
110:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#006.md). None ever hardened his heart
against God and prospered.

Lastly, The entertainment which this discourse of Christ met with among
the chief priests and elders, that heard his parables.

1\. They perceived that he spake of them ([Mat
21:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#045).md), and that in what they said
([Mat 21:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#041).md) they had but read their
own doom. Note, A guilty conscience needs no accuser, and sometimes will
save a minister the labour of saying, Thou art the man. Mutato nomine,
de te fabula narratur - Change but the name, the tale is told of the. So
quick and powerful is the word of God, and such a discerner of the
thoughts and intents of the heart, that it is easy for bad men (if
conscience be not quite seared) to perceive that it speaks of them.

2\. They sought to lay hands on him. Note, When those who hear the
reproofs of the word, perceive that it speaks of them, if it do not do
them a great deal of good, it will certainly do them a great deal of
hurt. If they be not pricked to the heart with conviction and
contrition, as they were [Act 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#037.md),
they will be cut to the heart with rage and indignation, as they were
[Act 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#033.md).

3\. They durst not do it, for fear of the multitude, who took him for a
prophet, though not for the Messiah; this served to keep the Pharisees
in awe. The fear of the people restrained them from speaking ill of John
([Mat 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#026).md), and here from doing ill
to Christ. Note, God has many ways of restraining the remainders of
wrath, as he has of making that which breaks out redound to his praise,
[Psa 76:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#010.md).
