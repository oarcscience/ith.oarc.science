### [Job Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 34:0</span></span>

Elihu, it is likely, paused awhile, to see if Job had any thing to say
against his discourse in the foregoing chapter; but he sitting silent,
and it is likely intimating his desire that he would go on, he here
proceeds. And, I. He bespeaks not only the audience, but the assistance
of the company ([Job 34:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#002).md). II. He
charges Job with some more indecent expressions that had dropped from
him ([Job 34:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#005).md). III. He undertakes
to convince him that he had spoken amiss, by showing very fully, 1.
God's incontestable justice ([Job
34:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#010.md), [Job
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#017.md), [Job
34:19](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#019.md), [Job
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#023).md). 2. His sovereign dominion
([Job 34:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#013).md). 3. His almighty power
([Job 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#020.md), [Job
34:24](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#024).md). 4. His omniscience ([Job
34:21](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#021.md), [Job
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#022.md), [Job
34:25](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#025).md). 5. His severity against
sinners ([Job 34:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#026).md). 6. His
overruling providence ([Job 34:29](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#029.md),
[Job 34:30](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#030).md). IV. He teaches him what
he should say ([Job 34:31](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#031.md), [Job
34:32](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#032).md). And then, lastly, he leaves
the matter to Job's own conscience, and concludes with a sharp reproof
of him for his peevishness and discontent ([Job
34:33-37](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#033).md). All this Job not only bore
patiently, but took kindly, because he saw that Elihu meant well; and,
whereas his other friends had accused him of that from which his own
conscience acquitted him, Elihu charged him with that only for which, it
is probable, his own heart, now upon the reflection, began to smite him.

[Job 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 34:1</span></span>

Here, I. Elihu humbly addresses himself to the auditors, and endeavours,
like an orator, to gain their good-will and their favourable attention.
1. He calls them wise men, and men that had knowledge, [Job
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#002.md). It is comfortable dealing with
such as understand sense. I speak as to wise men, who can judge what I
say, [Co1 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#015.md). Elihu differed in
opinion from them, and yet he calls them wise and knowing men. Peevish
disputants think all fools that are not of their mind; but it is a piece
of justice which we owe to those who are wise to acknowledge it, though
our sentiments do not agree with theirs. 2. He appeals to their
judgment, and therefore submits to their trial, [Job
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#003.md). The ear of the judicious tries
words, whether what is said be true or false, right or wrong, and he
that speaks must stand the test of the intelligent. As we must prove all
things we hear, so we must be willing that what we speak should be
proved. 3. He takes them into partnership with him in the examination
and discussion of this matter, [Job
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#004.md). He does not pretend to be sole
dictator, nor undertake to say what is just and good and what is not,
but he is willing to join with them in searching it out, and desires a
consultation: "Let us agree to lay aside all animosities and feuds, all
prejudices and affectation of contradiction, and all stiffness in
adhering to the opinion we have once espoused, and let us choose to
ourselves judgment; let us fix right principles on which to proceed, and
then take right methods for finding out truth; and let us know among
ourselves, by comparing notes and communicating our reasons, what is
good and what is otherwise." Note, We are then likely to discern what is
right when we agree to assist one another in searching it out.

II\. He warmly accuses Job for some passionate words which he had
spoken, that reflected on the divine government, appealing to the house
whether he ought not to be called to the bar and checked for them.

1\. He recites the words which Job had spoken, as nearly as he can
remember. (1.) He had insisted upon his own innocency. Job hath said, I
am righteous ([Job 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#005).md), and, when
urged to confess his guilt, had stiffly maintained his plea of, Not
guilty: Should I lie against my right? [Job
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#006.md). Job had spoken to this purport,
My righteousness I hold fast, [Job
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#006). (2..md) He had charged God with
injustice in his dealings with him, that he had wronged him in
afflicting him and had not righted him: God has taken away my judgment;
so Job had said, [Job 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#002). (3..md) He
had despaired of relief and concluded that God could not, or would not,
help him: My wound is incurable, and likely to be mortal, and yet
without transgression; not for any injustice in my hand, [Job
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#016.md), [Job
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#017). (4..md) He had, in effect, said
that there is nothing to be got in the service of God and that no man
will be the better at last for his ([Job
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#009).md): He hath said that which gives
occasion to suspect that he thinks it profiteth a man nothing that he
should delight himself with God. It is granted that there is a present
pleasure in religion; for what is it but to delight ourselves with God,
in communion with him, in concurrence with him, in walking with him as
Enoch did? this is a true notion of religion, and bespeaks its ways to
be pleasantness. Yet the advantage of it is denied, as if it were vain
to serve God, [Mal 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#014.md). This Elihu
gathers as Job's opinion, by an innuendo from what he said ([Job
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#022).md), He destroys the perfect and the
wicked, which has a truth in it (for all things come alike to all), but
it was ill expressed, and gave too much occasion for this imputation,
and therefore Job sat down silently under it and attempted not his own
vindication, whence Mr. Caryl well observes that good men sometimes
speak worse than they mean, and that a good man will rather bear more
blame than he deserves than to stand to excuse himself when he has
deserved any blame.

2\. He charges Job very high upon it. In general, What man is like Job?
[Job 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#007.md). "Did you ever know such a
man as Job, or ever hear a man talk at such an extravagant rate?" He
represents him, (1.) As sitting in the seat of the scornful: "He
drinketh up scorning like water," that is, "he takes a great deal of
liberty to reproach both God and his friends, takes a pleasure in so
doing, and is very liberal in his reflections." Or, "He is very greedy
in receiving and hearkening to the scorns and contempts which others
cast upon their brethren, is well pleased with them and extols them."
Or, as some explain it, "By these foolish expressions of his he makes
himself the object of scorn, lays himself very open to reproach, and
gives occasion to others to laugh at him; while his religion suffers by
them, and the reputation of that is wounded through his side." We have
need to pray that God will never leave us to ourselves to say or do any
thing which may make us a reproach to the foolish, [Psa
39:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#008). (2..md) As walking in the course of
the ungodly, and standing in the way of sinners: He goes in company with
the workers of iniquity ([Job 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#008).md),
not that in his conversation he did associate with them, but in his
opinion he did favour and countenance them, and strengthen their hands.
If (as it follows, [Job 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#009.md), for the
proof of this) it profits a man nothing to delight himself in God, why
should he not lay the reins on the neck of his lusts and herd with the
workers of iniquity? He that says, I have cleansed my hands in vain,
does not only offend against the generation of God's children ([Psa
72:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#013.md), [Psa
72:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#014).md), but gratifies his enemies, and
says as they say.

[Job 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 34:10</span></span>

The scope of Elihu's discourse to reconcile Job to his afflictions and
to pacify his spirit under them. In order to this he had shown, in the
foregoing chapter, that God meant him no hurt in afflicting him, but
intended it for his spiritual benefit. In this chapter he shows that he
did him no wrong in afflicting him, nor punished him more than he
deserved. If the former could not prevail to satisfy him, yet this ought
to silence him. In these verses he directs his discourse to all the
company: "Hearken to me, you men of understanding ([Job
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#010).md), and show yourselves to be
intelligent by assenting to this which I say." And this is that which he
says, That the righteous God never did, nor ever will do, any wrong to
any of his creatures, but his ways are equal, ours are unequal. The
truth here maintained respects the justice of equity of all God's
proceedings. Now observe in these verses,

I. How plainly this truth is laid down, both negatively and positively.
1. He does wrong to none: God cannot do wickedness, nor the Almighty
commit iniquity, [Job 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#010.md). It is
inconsistent with the perfection of his nature, and so it is also with
the purity of his will ([Job 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#012).md):
God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment. He
neither can nor will do a wrong thing, nor deal hardly with any man. He
will never inflict the evil of punishment but where he finds the evil of
sin, nor in any undue proportion, for that would be to commit iniquity
and do wickedly. If appeals be made to him, or he be to give a
definitive sentence, he will have an eye to the merits of the cause and
not respect the person, for that were to pervert judgment. He will never
either do any man wrong or deny any man right, but the heavens will
shortly declare his righteousness. Because he is God, and therefore is
infinitely perfect and holy, he can neither do wrong himself nor
countenance it in others, nay more than he can die, or lie, or deny
himself. Though he be Almighty, yet he never uses his power, as mighty
men often do, for the support of injustice. He is Shaddai - God
all-sufficient, and therefore he cannot be tempted with evil ([Jam
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013).md), to do an unrighteous thing. 2.
He ministers justice to all ([Job
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#011).md): The work of a man shall he
render unto him. Good works shall be rewarded and evil works either
punished or satisfied for; so that sooner or later, in this world or in
that to come, he will cause every man to find according to his ways.
This is the standing rule of distributive justice, to give to every man
according to his work. Say to the righteous, it shall be well with them;
woe to the wicked, it shall be ill with them. If services persevered in
now go unrewarded, and sins persisted in now go unpunished, yet there is
a day coming when God will fully render to every man according to his
works, with interest for the delay.

II\. How warmly it is asserted, 1. With an assurance of the truth of it:
Yea, surely, [Job 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#012.md). It is a truth
which none can deny or call in question; it is what we may take for
granted and are all agreed in, That God will not do wickedly. 2. With an
abhorrence of the very thought of the contrary ([Job
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#010).md): Far be it from God that he
should do wickedness, and from us that we should entertain the least
suspicion of it or say any thing that looks like charging him with it.

III\. How evidently it is proved by two arguments:

1\. His independent absolute sovereignty and dominion ([Job
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#013).md): Who has given him a charge
over the earth and deputed him to manage the affairs of men upon the
earth? Or, Who besides has disposed the whole world of mankind? He has
the sole administration of the kingdoms of men, and has it of himself,
nor is he entrusted with it by or for any other. (1.) It is certain that
the government is his, and he does according to his will in all the
hosts both of heaven and earth; and therefore he is not to be charged
with injustice; for shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? [Gen
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#025.md). How shall God either rule or
judge the world if there be, or could be, any unrighteousness with him?
[Rom 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005.md), [Rom
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#006.md). He that is entitled to such
unlimited power most certainly have in himself unspotted purity. This is
also a good reason why we should acquiesce in all God's dealings with
us. Shall not he that disposes of the whole world dispose of us and our
concerns? (2.) It is as certain that he does not derive his power from
any, nor is it a dispensation that is committed to him, but his power is
original, and, like his being, of himself; and therefore, if he were not
perfectly just, all the world and the affairs of it would soon be in the
utmost confusion. The highest powers on earth have a God above them, to
whom they are accountable, because it is not far from them to do
iniquity. But therefore God has none above him, because it is not
possible that he should do any thing (such is the perfection of his
nature) that should need to be controlled. And, if he be an absolute
sovereign, we are bound to submit to him, for there is no higher power
to which we may appeal, so that the virtue is a necessity.

2\. His irresistible power ([Job
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#014).md): If he set his heart upon man,
to contend with him, much more if (as some read it) he set his heart
against man, to ruin him, if he should deal with man either by summa
potestas - mere sovereignty, or by summum jus - strict justice, there
were no standing before him; man's spirit and breath would soon be gone
and all flesh would perish together, [Job
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#015.md). Many men's honesty is owing
purely to their impotency; they do not do wrong because they cannot
support it when it is done, or it is not in their power to do it. But
God is able to crush any man easily and suddenly, and yet does not by
arbitrary power crush any man, which therefore must be attributed to the
infinite perfection of his nature, and that is immutable. See here, (1.)
What God can do with us. He can soon bring us to dust; there needs not
any positive act of his omnipotence to do it; if he do but withdraw that
concurrence of his providence by which we live, if he gather unto
himself that spirit and breath which was from his hand at first and is
still in his hand, we expire immediately, like an animal in an air-pump
when the air is exhausted. (2.) What he may do with us without doing us
wrong. He may recall the being he gave, of which we are but tenants at
will, and which also we have forfeited; and therefore, as long as that
is continued of his mere favour, we have no reason to cry out of wrong,
whatever other comforts are removed.

[Job 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 34:16</span></span>

Elihu here addresses himself more directly to Job. He had spoken to the
rest ([Job 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#010).md) as men of
understanding; now, speaking to Job; he puts an if upon his
understanding: If thou hast understanding, hear this and observe it,
[Job 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#016.md).

I. Hear this, That God is not to be quarrelled with for any thing that
he does. It is daring presumption to arraign and condemn God's
proceedings, as Job had done by his discontents. It was, 1. As absurd as
it would be to advance one to power that is a professed enemy to
justice: Shall even he that hates right govern? [Job
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#017.md). The righteous Lord so loves
righteousness that, in comparison with him, even Job himself, though a
perfect and upright man, might be said to hate right; and shall he
govern? Shall he pretend to direct God or correct what he does? Shall
such unrighteous creatures as we are give law to the righteous God? or
must he take his measures from us? When we consider the corruption of
our nature, and the contrariety there is in us to the eternal rule of
equity, we cannot but see it to be an impudent impious thing for us to
prescribe to God. 2. It was as absurd as it would be to call a most
righteous innocent person to the bar, and to give judgment against him,
though it appeared ever so plainly, upon the trial, that he was most
just: Wilt thou condemn him that is righteous in all his ways, and
cannot but be so? 3. It is more absurd and unbecoming than it would be
to say to a sovereign prince, Thou art wicked, and to judges upon the
bench, You are ungodly, [Job 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#018.md).
This would be looked upon as an insufferable affront to majesty and to
magistracy; no king, no prince, would bear it. In favour of government,
we presume it is a right sentence that is passed, unless the contrary be
very evident; but, whatever we think, it is not fit to tell a king to
his face that he is wicked. Nathan reproved David by a parable. But,
whatever a high priest or a prophet might do, it is not for an ordinary
subject to make so bold with the powers that are. How absurd is then to
say so to God - to impute iniquity to him, who, having no respect of
persons, is in no temptation to do an unjust thing! He regardeth not the
rich more than the poor, and therefore it is fit he should rule, and it
is not fit we should find fault with him, [Job
34:19](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#019.md). Note, Rich and poor stand upon
the same level before God. A great man shall fare never the better, nor
find any favour, for his wealth and greatness; nor shall a poor man fare
ever the worse for his poverty, nor an honest cause be starved. Job, now
that he was poor, should have as much favour with God, and be as much
regarded by him, as when he was rich; for they are all the work of his
hands. Their persons are so: the poor are made by the same hand, and of
the same mould, as the rich. Their conditions are so: the poor were made
poor by the divine providence, as well as the rich made rich; and
therefore the poor shall fare never the worse for that which is their
lot, not their fault.

II\. Hear this, That God is to be acknowledged and submitted to in all
that he does. Divers considerations Elihu here suggests to Job, to beget
in him great and high thoughts of God, and so to persuade him to submit
and proceed no further in his quarrel with him.

1\. God is almighty, and able to deal with the strongest of men when he
enters into judgment with them ([Job
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#020).md); even the people, the body of a
nation, though ever so numerous, shall be troubled, unhinged, and put
into disorder, when God pleases; even the mighty man, the prince, though
ever so honourable, ever so formidable among men, shall, if God speak
the word, be taken away out of his throne, nay, out of the land of the
living; they shall die; they shall pass away. What cannot he do that has
all the powers of death at his command? Observe the suddenness of this
destruction: In a moment shall they die. It is not a work of time, with
God, to bring down his proud enemies, but, when he pleases, it is soon
done; nor is he bound to give them warning, no, not an hour's warning.
This night thy soul shall be required. Observe the season of it: They
shall be troubled at midnight, when they are secure and careless, and
unable to help themselves; as the Egyptians when their first-born were
slain. This is the immediate work of God: they are taken away, without
hand, insensibly, by secret judgments. God can himself humble the
greatest tyrant, without the assistance or agency of any man. Whatever
hand he sometimes uses in the accomplishing of his purposes, he needs
none, but can do it without hand. Nor is it one single mighty man only
that he can thus overpower, but even hosts of them ([Job
34:24](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#024).md): He shall break in pieces
mighty men without number; for no combined power can stand it out
against Omnipotence. Yet, when God destroys tyranny, he does not design
anarchy; if those are brought down that ruled ill, it does not therefore
follow that people must have no rulers; for, when he breaks mighty men,
he sets others in their stead, that will rule better, or, if they do
not, he overturns them also in the night, or in a night, so that they
are destroyed, [Job 34:25](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#025.md). Witness
Belshazzar. Or, if he designs them space to repent, he does not
presently destroy them, but he strikes them as wicked men, [Job
34:26](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#026.md). Some humbling mortifying
judgments are brought upon them; these wicked rulers are stricken as
other wicked men, as surely, as sorely, stricken in their bodies,
estates, or families, and this for warning to their neighbours; the
stroke is given in terrorem - as an alarm to others, and therefore is
given in the open sight of others, that they also may see and fear, and
tremble before the justice of God. If kings stand not before him, how
shall we stand!

2\. God is omniscient, and can discover that which is most secret. As
the strongest cannot oppose his arm, so the most subtle cannot escape
his eye; and therefore, if some are punished either more or less than we
think they should be, instead of quarrelling with God, it becomes us to
ascribe it to some secret cause known to God only. For, (1.) Every thing
is open before him ([Job 34:21](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#021).md): His
eyes are upon the ways of man; not only they are within reach of his
eye, so that he can see them, but his eye is upon them, so that he
actually observes and inspects them. He sees us all, and sees all our
goings; go where we will, we are under his eye; all our actions, good
and evil, are regarded and recorded and reserved to be brought into
judgment when the books shall be opened. (2.) Nothing is or can be
concealed from him ([Job 34:22](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#022).md): There
is no darkness nor shadow of death so close, so thick, so solitary, so
remote from light or sight as that in it the workers of iniquity may
hide themselves from the discovering eye and avenging hand of the
righteous God. Observe here, \[1.\] The workers of iniquity would hide
themselves if they could from the eye of the world for shame (and that
perhaps they may do), and from the eye of God for fear, as Adam among
the trees of the garden. The day is coming when mighty men, and chief
captains, will call to the rocks and mountains to hide them. \[2.\] They
would gladly be hid even by the shadow of death, be hid in the grave,
and lie for ever there, rather than appear before the judgment-seat of
Christ. (3.) It is in vain to think of flying from God's justice, or
absconding when his wrath is in pursuit of us. The workers of iniquity
may find ways and means to hide themselves from men, but not from God:
He knows their works ([Job 34:25](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#025).md),
both what they do and what they design.

3\. God is righteous, and, in all his proceedings, goes according to the
rules of equity. Even when he is overturning mighty men, and breaking
them in pieces, yet he will not lay upon man more than right, [Job
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#023.md). As he will not punish the
innocent, so he will not exact of those that are guilty more than their
iniquities deserve; and of the proportion between the sin and the
punishment Infinite Wisdom shall be the judge. He will not give any man
cause to complain that he deals hardly with him, nor shall any man enter
into judgment with God, or bring an action against him. If he do, God
will be justified when he speaks and clear when he judges. Therefore Job
was very much to be blamed for his complaints of God, and is here
well-advised to let fall his action, for he would certainly be cast or
non-suited. It is not for man ever to purpose to enter into judgment
with the Omnipotent; so some read the whole verse. Job had often wished
to plead his cause before God. Elihu asks, "To what purpose? The
judgment already given concerning thee will certainly be affirmed; no
errors can be found in it, nor any exceptions taken to it, but, after
all, it must rest as it is." All is well that God does, and will be
found so. To prove that when God destroys the mighty men, and strikes
them as wicked men, he does not lay upon them more than right, he shows
what their wickedness was (v. 27, 28); and let any compare that with
their punishment, and then judge whether they did not deserve it. In
short, these unjust judges, whom God will justly judge, neither feared
God nor regarded man, [Luk 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#002). (1..md)
They were rebels to God: They turned back from him, cast off the fear of
him, and abandoned the very thoughts of him; for they would not consider
any of his ways, took no heed either to his precepts or to his
providences, but lived without God in the world. This is at the bottom
of all the wickedness of the wicked, they turn back from God; and it is
because they do not consider, not because they cannot, but because they
will not. From inconsideration comes impiety, and thence all immorality.
(2.) They were tyrants to all mankind, [Job
34:28](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#028.md). They will not call upon God for
themselves; but they cause the cry of the poor to come to him, and that
cry is against them. They are injurious and oppressive to the poor,
wrong them, crush them, impoverish them yet more, and add affliction to
the afflicted, who cry unto God, make their complaint to him, and he
hears them and pleads their cause. Their case is bad who have the
prayers and tears of the poor against them; for the cry of the oppressed
will, sooner or later, draw down vengeance on the heads of the
oppressors, and no one can say that this is more than right, [Exo
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#023.md).

4\. God has an uncontrollable dominion in all the affairs of the
children of men, and so guides and governs whatever concerns both
communities and particular persons, that, as what he designs cannot be
defeated, so what he does cannot be changed, [Job
34:29](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#029). Observe, (1..md) The frowns of all
the world cannot trouble those whom God quiets with his smiles. When he
gives quietness who then can make trouble? [Job
34:29](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#029.md). This is a challenge to all the
powers of hell and earth to disquiet those to whom God speaks peace, and
for whom he creates it. If God give outward peace to a nation, he can
secure what he gives, and disable the enemies of it to give it any
disturbance. If God give inward peace to a man only, the quietness and
everlasting assurance which are the effect of righteousness, neither the
accusations of Satan nor the afflictions of this present time, no, nor
the arrests of death itself, can give trouble. What can make those
uneasy whose souls dwell at ease in God? See [Phi
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007). (2..md) The smiles of all the world
cannot quiet those whom God troubles with his frowns; for if he, in
displeasure, hide his face, and withhold the comfort of his favour, who
then can behold him? that is, Who can behold a displeased God, so as to
bear up under his wrath or turn it away? Who can make him show his face
when he resolves to hide it, or see through the clouds and darkness
which are round about him? Or, Who can behold a disquieted sinner, so as
to give him effectual relief? Who can stand a friend to him to whom God
is an enemy? None can relieve the distresses of the outward condition
without God. If the Lord do not help thee, whence shall I? [Kg2
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#027.md). Nor can any relieve the
distresses of the mind against God and his terrors. If he impress the
sense of his wrath upon a guilty conscience, all the comforts the
creature can administer are ineffectual. As vinegar upon nitre, so are
songs to a heavy heart. The irresistibleness of God's operations must be
acknowledged in his dealings both with communities and with particular
persons: what he does cannot be controlled, whether it be done against a
nation in its public capacity or against a man only in his private
affairs. The same Providence that governs mighty kingdoms presides in
the concerns of the meanest individual; and neither the strength of a
whole nation can resist his power nor the smallness of a single person
evade his cognizance; but what he does shall be done effectually and
victoriously.

5\. God is wise, and careful of the public welfare, and therefore
provides that the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared, [Job
34:30](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#030). See here, (1..md) The pride of
hypocrites. They aim to reign; the praise of men, and power in the
world, are their reward, what they aim at. (2.) The policy of tyrants.
When they aim to set up themselves they sometimes make use of religion
as a cloak and cover for their ambition and by their hypocrisy come to
the throne. (3.) The danger the people are in when hypocrites reign.
They are likely to be ensnared in sin, or trouble, or both. Power, in
the hands of dissemblers, is often destructive to the rights and
liberties of a people, which they are more easily wheedled out of than
forced out of. Much mischief has been done likewise to the power of
godliness under the pretence of a form of godliness. (4.) The care which
divine Providence takes of the people, to prevent this danger, that the
hypocrite reign not, either that he do not reign at all or that he do
not reign long. If God has mercy in store for a people, he will either
prevent the rise or hasten the ruin of hypocritical rulers.

[Job 34:31](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">job 34:31</span></span>

In these verses,

I. Elihu instructs Job what he should say under his affliction, [Job
34:31](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#031.md), [Job
34:32](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#032.md). Having reproved him for his
peevish passionate words, he here puts better words into his mouth. When
we reprove for what is amiss we must direct to what is good, that our
reproofs may be the reproofs of instruction, [Pro
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#023.md). He does not impose it upon Job
to use these words, but recommends it to him, as that which was meet to
be said. In general, he would have him repent of his misconduct, and
indecent expressions, under his affliction. Job's other friends would
have had him own himself a wicked man, and by overdoing they undid.
Elihu will oblige him only to own that he had, in the management of this
controversy, spoken unadvisedly with his lips. Let us remember this, in
giving reproofs, and not make the matter worse than it is; for the
stretching of the crime may defeat the prosecution. Elihu drives the
right nail, and speeds accordingly. He directs Job, 1. To humble himself
before God for his sins, and to accept the punishment of them: "I have
borne chastisement. What I suffer comes justly upon me, and therefore I
will bear it, and not only justify God in it, but acknowledge his
goodness." Many are chastised that do not bear chastisement, do not bear
it well, and so, in effect, do not bear it at all. Penitents, if
sincere, will take all well that God does, and will bear chastisement as
a medicinal operation intended for good. 2. To pray to God to discover
his sins to him ([Job 34:32](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#032).md): "That
which I see not teach thou me. Lord, upon the review, I find much amiss
in me and much done amiss by me, but I have reason to fear there is much
more that I am not aware of, greater abominations, which through
ignorance, mistake, and partiality to myself, I do not yet see; Lord,
give me to see it, awaken by conscience to do its office faithfully." A
good man is willing to know the worst of himself, and particularly,
under affliction, desires to be told wherefore God contends with him and
what God designs in correcting him. 3. To promise reformation ([Job
34:31](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#031).md): I will not offend any more.
"If I have done iniquity (or seeing that I have), I will do so no more;
whatever thou shalt discover to me to have been amiss, by thy grace I
will amend it for the future." This implies a confession that we have
offended, true remorse and godly sorrow for the offence, and a humble
compliance with God's design in afflicting us, which is to separate
between us and our sins. The penitent here completes his repentance; for
it is not enough to be sorry for our sins, but we must go and sin no
more, and, as here, bind ourselves with the bond of a fixed resolution
never more to return to folly. This is meet to be said in a stedfast
purpose, and meet to be said to God in a solemn promise and vow.

II\. He reasons with him concerning his discontent and uneasiness under
his affliction, [Job 34:23](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#023.md). We are
ready to think every thing that concerns us should be just as we would
have it; but Elihu here shows, 1. That it is absurd and unreasonable to
expect this: "Should it be according to thy mind? No, what reason for
that?" Elihu here speaks with a great deference to the divine will and
wisdom, and a satisfaction therein: it is highly fit that every thing
should be according to God's mind. He speaks also with a just disdain of
the pretensions of those that are proud, and would be their own carvers:
Should it be according to thy mind? Should we always have the good we
have a mind to enjoy? We should then wrongfully encroach upon others and
foolishly ensnare ourselves. Must we never be afflicted, because we have
no mind to it? Is it fit that sinners should feel no smart, that
scholars should be under no discipline? Or, if we must be afflicted, is
it fit that we should choose what rod we will be beaten with? No; it is
fit that every thing should be according to God's mind, and not ours;
for he is the Creator, and we are creatures. He is infinitely wise and
knowing; we are foolish and short-sighted. He is in one mind; we are in
many. 2. That it is in vain, and to no purpose, to expect it: "He will
recompense it whether thou refuse or whether thou choose. God will take
his own way, fulfil his own counsel, and recompense according to the
sentence of his own justice, whether thou art pleased or displeased; he
will neither ask thy leave nor ask thy advice, but, what he pleases,
that will he do. It is therefore thy wisdom to be easy, and make a
virtue of necessity; make the best of that which is, because it is out
of thy power to make it otherwise. If thou pretend to choose and
refuse," that is, "to prescribe to God and except against what he does,
so will not I - I will acquiesce in all he does; and therefore speak
what thou knowest; say what thou wilt do, whether thou wilt oppose or
submit. The matter lies plainly before thee; be at a point; thou art in
God's hand, not in mine."

III\. He appeals to all intelligent indifferent persons whether there
was not a great deal of sin and folly in that which Job said. 1. He
would have the matter thoroughly examined, and brought to an issue ([Job
34:36](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#036).md): "My desire is that Job may be
tried unto the end. If any will undertake to justify what he has said,
let them do it; if not, let us all agree to bear our testimony against
it." Many understand it of his trial by afflictions: "Let his troubles
be continued till he be thoroughly humbled, and his proud spirit brought
down, till he be made to see his error and to retract what he has so
presumptuously said against God and his providence. Let the trial be
continued till the end be obtained." 2. He appeals both to God and man,
and desires the judgment of both upon it. (1.) Some read v. 36 as an
appeal to God: O, my Father! let Job be tried. So the margin of our
Bibles, for the same word signifies my desire and my father; and some
suppose that he lifted up his eyes when he said this, meaning, "O my
Father who art in heaven! let Job be tried till he be subdued." When we
are praying for the benefit of afflictions either to ourselves or others
we must eye God as a Father, because they are fatherly corrections and a
part of our filial education, [Heb
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#007). (2..md) He appeals to the
by-standers ([Job 34:34](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#034).md): "Let men of
understanding tell me whether they can put any more favourable
construction upon Job's words than I have put, and whether he has not
spoken very ill and ought not to cry, Peccavi - I have done wrong." In
what Job had said he thought it appeared, \[1.\] That he did not rightly
understand himself, but had talked foolishly, [Job
34:35](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#035.md). He cannot say that Job is
without knowledge and wisdom; but, in this matter, he has spoken without
knowledge, and, whatever his heart is, his words were without prudence.
What he said to his wife may be retorted upon himself (He speaks as one
of the foolish men speak) and for the same reason, Shall we not receive
evil as well as good at God's hand? [Job
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#010.md). Sometimes we need and deserve
those reproofs ourselves which we have given to others. Those that
reproach God's wisdom really reproach their own. \[2.\] That he had not
a due regard to God, but had talked wickedly. If what he had said be
tried to the end, that is, if one put it to the utmost stretch and make
the worst of it, it will be found, First, That he has taken part with
God's enemies: His answers have been for wicked men; that is, what he
had said tended to strengthen the hands and harden the hearts of wicked
people in their wickedness, he having carried the matter of their
prosperity much further than he needed. Let wicked men, like Baal, plead
for themselves if they will, but far be it from us that we should answer
for them, or say any thing in favour of them. Secondly, That he has
insulted God's friends, and hectored over them: "He clappeth his hands
among us; and, if he be not thoroughly tried and humbled, will grow yet
more insolent and imperious, as if he had gotten the day and silenced us
all." To speak ill is bad enough, but to clap our hands and triumph in
it when we have done, as if error and passion had won the victory, is
much worse. Thirdly, That he has spoken against God himself, and, by
standing to what he had said, added rebellion to his sin. To speak,
though but one word, against God, by whom we speak and for whom we ought
to speak, is a great sin; what is it then to multiply words against him,
as if we would out-talk him? What is it to repeat them, instead of
unsaying them? Those that have sinned, and, when they are called to
repent, thus go on frowardly, add rebellion to their sin and make it
exceedingly sinful. Errare possum, Haereticus esse nolo - I may fall
into error, but I will not plunge into heresy.
