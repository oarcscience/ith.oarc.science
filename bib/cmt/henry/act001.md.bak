### [Acts Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

The inspired historian begins his narrative of the Acts of the Apostles,
I. With a reference to, and a brief recapitulation of, his gospel, or
history of the life of Christ, inscribing this, as he had done that, to
his friend Theophilus ([Act 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md), [Act
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#002).md). II. With a summary of the proofs
of Christ's resurrection, his conference with his disciples, and the
instructions he gave them during the forty days, of his continuance on
earth ([Act 1:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#003).md). III. With a
particular narrative of Christ's ascension into heaven, his disciples'
discourse with him before he ascended, and the angels' discourse with
them after he ascended ([Act 1:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#006).md).
IV. With a general idea of the embryo of the Christian church, and its
state from Christ's ascension to the pouring out of the Spirit ([Act
1:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#012).md). V. With a particular account
of the filling up of the vacancy that was made in the sacred college by
the death of Judas, by the electing of Matthias in his room ([Act
1:15-26](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015).md).

[Acts 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 1:1</span></span>

In these verses, I. Theophilus is put in mind, and we in him, of St.
Luke's gospel, which it will be of use for us to cast an eye upon before
we enter upon the study of this book, that we may not only see how this
begins where that breaks off, but that, as in water face answers to
face, so do the acts of the apostles to the acts of their Master, the
acts of his grace.

1\. His patron, to whom he dedicates this book (I should rather say his
pupil, for he designs, in dedicating it to him, to instruct and direct
him, and not to crave his countenance or protection), is Theophilus,
[Act 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md). In the epistle dedicatory
before his gospel, he had called him most excellent Theophilus; here he
calls him no more than O Theophilus; not that he had lost his
excellency, nor that it was diminished and become less illustrious; but
perhaps he had now quitted his place, whatever it was, for the sake of
which that title was given him, - or he was now grown into years, and
despised such titles of respect more than he had done, - or Luke was
grown more intimate with him, and therefore could address him with the
more freedom. It was usual with the ancients, both Christian and heathen
writers, thus to inscribe their writings to some particular persons. But
the directing some of the books of the scripture so is an intimation to
each of us to receive them as if directed to us in particular, to us by
name; for whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our
learning.

2\. His gospel is here called the former treatise which he had made,
which he had an eye to in writing this, intending this for a
continuation and confirmation of that, ton prōton logon - the former
word. What is written of the gospel is the word as truly as what was
spoken; nay, we now know no unwritten word that we are to give credit
to, but as it agrees with that which is written. He made the former
treatise, and now is divinely inspired to make this, for Christ's
scholars must go on towards perfection, [Heb
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001.md). And therefore their guides must
help them on, must still teach the people knowledge ([Ecc
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#009).md), and not think that their former
labours, though ever so good, will excuse them from further labours; but
they should rather be quickened and encouraged by them, as St. Luke
here, who, because he had laid the foundation in a former treatise, will
build upon it in this. Let not this therefore drive out that; let not
new sermons and new books make us forget old ones, but put us in mind of
them, and help us to improve them.

3\. The contents of his gospel were that, all that, which Jesus began
both to do and teach; and the same is the subject of the writings of the
other three evangelists. Observe, (1.) Christ both did and taught. The
doctrine he taught was confirmed by the miraculous works he did, which
proved him a teacher come from God ([Joh
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#002).md); and the duties he taught were
copied out in the holy gracious works he did, for he hath left us an
example, and that such as proves him a teacher come from God too, for by
their fruits you shall know them. Those are the best ministers that both
do and teach, whose lives are a constant sermon. (2.) He began both to
do and teach; he laid the foundation of all that was to be taught and
done in the Christian church. His apostles were to carry on and continue
what he began, and to do and teach the same things. Christ set them in,
and then left them to go on, but sent his Spirit to empower them both to
do and teach. It is a comfort to those who are endeavouring to carry on
the work of the gospel that Christ himself began it. The great salvation
at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, [Heb
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#003). (3..md) The four evangelists, and
Luke particularly, have handed down to us all that Jesus began both to
do and to teach; not all the particulars - the world could not have
contained them; but all the heads, samples of all, so many, and in such
variety, that by them we may judge of the rest. We have the beginnings
of his doctrine ([Mat 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#017).md), and the
beginnings of his miracles, [Joh 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#011.md).
Luke had spoken, had treated, of all Christ's sayings and doings, had
given us a general idea of them, though he had not recorded each in
particular.

4\. The period of the evangelical story is fixed to the day in which he
was taken up, [Act 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#002.md). Then it was
that he left this world, and his bodily presence was no more in it. St.
Mark's gospel concludes with the Lord's being received up into heaven
([Mar 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#019).md), and so does St. Luke's,
[Luk 24:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#051.md). Christ continued doing and
teaching to the last, till he was taken up to the other work he had to
do within the veil.

II\. The truth of Christ's resurrection is maintained and evidenced,
[Act 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#003.md). That part of what was
related in the former treatise was so material that it was necessary to
be upon all occasions repeated. The great evidence of his resurrection
was that he showed himself alive to his apostles; being alive, he showed
himself so, and he was seen of them. They were honest men, and one may
depend upon their testimony; but the question is whether they were not
imposed upon, as many a well-meaning man is. No, they were not; for, 1.
The proofs were infallible, tekmēria - plain indications, both that he
was alive (he walked and talked with them, he ate and drank with them)
and that it was he himself, and not another; for he showed them again
and again the marks of the wounds in his hands, and feet, and side,
which was the utmost proof the thing was capable of or required. 2. They
were many, and often repeated: He was seen by them forty days, not
constantly residing with them, but frequently appearing to them, and
bringing them by degrees to be fully satisfied concerning it, so that
all their sorrow for his departure was done away by it. Christ's staying
upon earth so long after he had entered upon his state of exaltation and
glory, to confirm the faith of his disciples and comfort their hearts,
was such an instance of condescension and compassion to believers as may
fully assure us that we have a high priest that is touched with the
feeling of our infirmities.

III\. A general hint given of the instructions he furnished his
disciples with, now that he was about to leave them, and they, since he
breathed on them and opened their understandings, were better able to
receive them. 1. He instructed them concerning the work they were to do:
He gave commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen. Note, Christ's
choice is always attended with his charge. Those whom he elected into
the apostleship expected he should give them preferments, instead of
which he gave them commandments. When he took his journey, and gave
authority to his servants, and to every one his work ([Mar
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#034).md), he gave them commandments
through the Holy Ghost, which he was himself filled with as Mediator,
and which he had breathed into them. In giving them the Holy Ghost, he
gave them his commandments; for the Comforter will be a commander; and
his office was to bring to their remembrance what Christ had said. He
charged those that were apostles by the Holy Ghost; so the words are
placed. It was their receiving the Holy Ghost that sealed their
commission, [Joh 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#022.md). He was not
taken up till after he had given them their charge, and so finished his
work. 2. He instructed them concerning the doctrine they were to preach:
He spoke to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God. He had
given them a general idea of that kingdom, and the certain time it
should be set up in the world (in his parable, Mk. 13), but here he
instructed them more in the nature of it, as a kingdom of grace in this
world and of glory in the other, and opened to them that covenant which
is the great charter by which it is incorporated. Now this was intended,
(1.) To prepare them to receive the Holy Ghost, and to go through that
which they were designed for. He tells them in secret what they must
tell the world; and they shall find that the Spirit of truth, when he
comes, will say the same. (2.) To be one of the proofs of Christ's
resurrection; so it comes in here; the disciples, to whom he showed
himself alive, knew that it was he, not only by what he showed them, but
by what he said to them. None but he could speak thus clearly, thus
fully, of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God. He did not
entertain them with discourses of politics or the kingdoms of men, of
philosophy or the kingdom of nature, but pure divinity and the kingdom
of grace, the things which most nearly concerned them, and those to whom
they were sent.

IV\. A particular assurance given them that they should now shortly
receive the Holy Ghost, with orders given them to expect it ([Act
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#004.md), [Act
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#005).md), he being assembled together with
them, probably in the interview at the mountain in Galilee which he had
appointed before his death; for there is mention of their coming
together again ([Act 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#006).md), to attend
his ascension. Though he had now ordered them to Galilee, yet they must
not think to continue there; no, they must return to Jerusalem, and not
depart thence. Observe,

1\. The command he gives them to wait. This was to raise their
expectations of something great; and something very great they had
reason to expect from their exalted Redeemer. (1.) They must wait till
the time appointed, which is now not many days hence. Those that by
faith hope promised mercies will come must with patience wait till they
do come, according to the time, the set time. And when the time draws
nigh, as now it did, we must, as Daniel, look earnestly for it, [Dan
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#003). (2..md) They must wait in the place
appointed, in Jerusalem, for there the Spirit must be first poured out,
because Christ was to be as king upon the holy hill of Zion; and because
the word of the Lord must go forth from Jerusalem; this must be the
mother-church. There Christ was put to shame, and therefore there he
will have this honour done him, and this favour is done to Jerusalem to
teach us to forgive our enemies and persecutors. The apostles were more
exposed to danger at Jerusalem than they would have been in Galilee; but
we may cheerfully trust God with our safety, when we keep in the way of
our duty. The apostles were now to put on a public character, and
therefore must venture in a public station. Jerusalem was the fittest
candlestick for those lights to be set up in.

2\. The assurance he gives them that they shall not wait in vain.

(1.) The blessing designed them shall come, and they shall find it was
worth waiting for; You shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost; that is,
\[1.\] "The Holy Ghost shall be poured out upon you more plentifully
than ever." They had already been breathed upon with the Holy Ghost
([Joh 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#022).md), and they had found the
benefit of it; but now they shall have larger measures of his gifts,
graces, and comforts, and be baptized with them, in which there seems to
be an allusion to those Old Testament promises of the pouring out of the
Spirit, [Joe 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028.md); [Isa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003.md); [Isa
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#015.md). \[2.\] "You shall be cleansed
and purified by the Holy Ghost," as the priests were baptized and washed
with water, when they were consecrated to the sacred function: "They had
the sign; you shall have the thing signified. You shall be sanctified by
the truth, as the Spirit shall lead you more and more into it, and have
your consciences purged by the witness of the Spirit, that you may serve
the living God in the apostleship." \[3.\] "You shall hereby be more
effectually than ever engaged to your Master, and to his guidance, as
Israel was baptized unto Moses in the cloud, and in the sea; you shall
be tied so fast to Christ that you shall never, for fear of any
sufferings, forsake him again, as once you did."

(2.) Now this gift of the Holy Ghost he speaks of,

\[1.\] As the promise of the Father, which they had heard of him, and
might therefore depend upon. First, The Spirit was given by promise, and
it was at this time the great promise, as that of the Messiah was before
([Luk 1:72](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#072).md), and that of eternal life
is now, [Jo1 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#025.md). Temporal good
things are given by Providence, but the Spirit and spiritual blessings
are given by promise, [Gal 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#018.md). The
Spirit of God is not given as the spirit of men is given us, and formed
within us, by a course of nature ([Zac
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001).md), but by the word of God. 1. That
the gift may be the more valuable, Christ thought the promise of the
Spirit a legacy worth leaving to his church. 2. That it may be the more
sure, and that the heirs of promise may be confident of the immutability
of God's counsel herein. 3. That it may be of grace, peculiar grace, and
may be received by faith, laying hold on the promise, and depending upon
it. As Christ, so the Spirit, is received by faith. Secondly, It was the
promise of the Father, 1. Of Christ's Father. Christ, as Mediator, had
an eye to God as his Father, fathering his design, and owning it all
along. 2. Of our Father, who, if he give us the adoption of sons, will
certainly give us the Spirit of adoption, [Gal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#005.md), [Gal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006.md). He will give the Spirit, as the
Father of lights, as the Father of spirits, and as the Father of
mercies; it is the promise of the Father. Thirdly, This promise of the
Father they had heard from Christ many a time, especially in the
farewell sermon he preached to them a little before he died, wherein he
assured them, again and again, that the Comforter should come. This
confirms the promise of God, and encourages us to depend upon it, that
we have heard it from Jesus Christ; for in him all the promises of God
are yea, and amen. "You have heard it from me; and I will make it good."

\[2.\] As the prediction of John Baptist; for so far back Christ here
directs them to look ([Act 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#005).md): "You
have not only heard it from me, but you had it from John; when he turned
you over to me, he said ([Mat 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011).md), I
indeed baptize you with water, but he that comes after me shall baptize
you with the Holy Ghost." It is a great honour that Christ now does to
John, not only to quote his words, but to make this great gift of the
Spirit, now at hand, to be the accomplishment of them. Thus he
confirmeth the word of his servants, his messengers, [Isa
44:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#026.md). But Christ can do more than any
of his ministers. It is an honour to them to be employed in dispensing
the means of grace, but it his prerogative to give the Spirit of grace.
He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, shall teach you by his Spirit,
and give his Spirit to make intercession in you, which is more than the
best ministers preaching with us.

(3.) Now this gift of the Holy Ghost thus promised, thus prophesied of,
thus waited for, is that which we find the apostles received in the next
chapter, for in that this promise had its full accomplishment; this was
it that should come, and we look for no other; for it is here promised
to be given not many days hence. He does not tell them how many, because
they must keep every day in a frame fit to receive it. Other scriptures
speak of the gift of the Holy Ghost to ordinary believers; this speaks
of that particular power which, by the Holy Ghost, the first preachers
of the gospel, and planters of the church, were endued with, enabling
them infallibly to relate to that age, and record to posterity, the
doctrine of Christ, and the proofs of it; so that by virtue of this
promise, and the performance of it, we receive the New Testament as of
divine inspiration, and venture our souls upon it.

[Acts 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 1:6</span></span>

In Jerusalem Christ, by his angel, had appointed his disciples to meet
him in Galilee; there he appointed them to meet him in Jerusalem again,
such a day. Thus he would try their obedience, and it was found ready
and cheerful; they came together, as he appointed them, to be the
witnesses of his ascension, of which we have here an account. Observe,

I. The question they asked him at this interview. They came together to
him, as those that had consulted one another about it, and concurred in
the question nemine contradicente - unanimously; they came in a body,
and put it to him as the sense of the house, Lord, wilt thou at this
time restore again the kingdom to Israel? Two ways this may be taken: -

1\. "Surely thou wilt not at all restore it to the present rulers of
Israel, the chief priests and the elders, that put thee to death, and,
to compass that design, tamely gave up the kingdom to Caesar, and owned
themselves his subjects. What! Shall those that hate and persecute thee
and us be trusted with power? This be far from thee." Or rather,

2\. "Surely thou wilt now restore it to the Jewish nation, as far as it
will submit to thee as their king." Now two things were amiss in this
question: -

(1.) Their expectation of the thing itself. They thought Christ would
restore the kingdom to Israel, that is, that he would make the nation of
the Jews as great and considerable among the nations as it was in the
days of David and Solomon, of Asa and Jehoshaphat; that, as Shiloh, he
would restore the sceptre to Judah, and the lawgiver; whereas Christ
came to set up his own kingdom, and that a kingdom of heaven, not to
restore the kingdom to Israel, an earthly kingdom. See here, \[1.\] How
apt even good men are to place the happiness of the church too much in
external pomp and power; as if Israel could not be glorious unless the
kingdom were restored to it, nor Christ's disciples honoured unless they
were peers of the realm; whereas we are told to expect the cross in this
world, and to wait for the kingdom in the other world. \[2.\] How apt we
are to retain what we have imbibed, and how hard it is to get over the
prejudices of education. The disciples, having sucked in this notion
with their milk that the Messiah was to be a temporal prince, were long
before they could be brought to have any idea of his kingdom as
spiritual. \[3.\] How naturally we are biassed in favour of our own
people. They thought God would have no kingdom in the world unless it
were restored to Israel; whereas the kingdoms of this world were to
become his, in whom he would be glorified, whether Israel should sink or
swim. \[4.\] How apt we are to misunderstand scripture - to understand
that literally which is spoken figuratively, and to expound scripture by
our schemes, whereas we ought to form our schemes by the scriptures.
But, when the Spirit shall be poured out from on high, our mistakes will
be rectified, as the apostles' soon after were.

(2.) Their enquiry concerning the time of it: "Lord, wilt thou do it at
this time? Now that thou hast called us together is it for this purpose,
that proper measures may be concerted for the restoring of the kingdom
to Israel? Surely there cannot be a more favourable juncture than this."
Now herein they missed their mark, \[1.\] That they were inquisitive
into that which their Master had never directed nor encouraged them to
enquire into. \[2.\] That they were impatient for the setting up of that
kingdom in which they promised themselves so great a share, and would
anticipate the divine counsels. Christ had told them that they should
sit on thrones ([Luk 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#030).md), and now
nothing will serve them but they must be in the throne immediately, and
cannot stay the time; whereas he that believeth doth not make haste, but
is satisfied that God's time is the best time.

II\. The check which Christ gave to this question, like that which he
had a little before given to Peter's enquiry concerning John, What is
that to thee? [Act 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007.md), It is not for
you to know the times and seasons. He does not contradict their
expectation that the kingdom would be restored to Israel, because that
mistake would soon be rectified by the pouring out of the Spirit, after
which they never had any more thoughts of the temporal kingdom; and also
because there is a sense of the expectation which is true, the setting
up of the gospel kingdom in the world; and their mistake of the promise
shall not make it of no effect; but he checks their enquiry after the
time.

1\. The knowledge of this is not allowed to them: It is not for you to
know, and therefore it is not for you to ask. (1.) Christ is now parting
from them, and parts in love; and yet he gives them this rebuke, which
is intended for a caution to his church in all ages, to take heed of
splitting upon the rock which was fatal to our first parents - an
inordinate desire of forbidden knowledge, and intruding into things
which we have not seen because God has not shown them. Nescire velle
quae magister maximus docere non vult, erudita inscitia est - It is
folly to covet to be wise above what is written, and wisdom to be
content to be no wiser. (2.) Christ had given his disciples a great deal
of knowledge above others (to you it is given to know the mysteries of
the kingdom of God), and had promised them his Spirit, to teach them
more; now, lest they should be puffed up with the abundance of the
revelations, he here lets them understand that there were some things
which it was not for them to know. We shall see how little reason we
have to be proud of our knowledge when we consider how many things we
are ignorant of. (3.) Christ had given his disciples instructions
sufficient for the discharge of their duty, both before his death and
since his resurrection, and in this knowledge he will have them to be
satisfied; for it is enough for a Christian, in whom vain curiosity is a
corrupt humour, to be mortified, and not gratified. (4.) Christ had
himself told his disciples the things pertaining to the kingdom of God,
and had promised that the Spirit should show them things to come
concerning it, [Joh 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013.md). He had
likewise given them signs of the times, which it was their duty to
observe, and a sin to overlook, [Mat
24:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#033.md); [Mat
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#003.md). But they must not expect nor
desire to know either all the particulars of future events or the exact
times of them. It is good for us to be kept in the dark, and left at
uncertainty concerning the times and moments (as Dr. Hammond reads it)
of future events concerning the church, as well as concerning ourselves,
- concerning all the periods of time and the final period of it, as well
as concerning the period of our own time.

Prudens futuri temporis exitum

Caliginosa nocte premit Deus -

But Jove, in goodness ever wise,

Hath hid, in clouds of thickest night,

All that in future prospect lies

Beyond the ken of mortal sight.

\- Hor.

As to the times and seasons of the year, we know, in general, there will
be summer and winter counterchanged, but we know not particularly which
day will be fair or which foul, either in summer or in winter; so, as to
our affairs in this world, when it is a summer-time of prosperity, that
we may not be secure, we are told there will come a wintertime of
trouble; and in that winter, that we may not despond and despair, we are
assured that summer will return; but what this or that particular day
will bring forth we cannot tell, but must accommodate ourselves to it,
whatever it is, and make the best of it.

2\. The knowledge of it is reserved to God as his prerogative; it is
what the Father hath put in his own power; it is hid with him. None
besides can reveal the times and seasons to come. Known unto God are all
his works, but not to us, [Act 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#018.md).
It is in his power, and in his only, to declare the end from the
beginning; and by this he proves himself to be God, [Isa
46:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#010.md). "And though he did think fit
sometimes to let the Old Testament prophets know the times and the
seasons (as of the Israelites' bondage in Egypt four hundred years, and
in Babylon seventy years), yet he has not fit to let you know the times
and seasons, no not just how long it shall be before Jerusalem be
destroyed, though you be so well assured of the thing itself. He hath
not said that he will not give you to know something more than you do of
the times and seasons;" he did so afterwards to his servant John; "but
he has put it in his own power to do it or not, as he thinks fit;" and
what is in that New Testament prophecy discovered concerning the times
and the seasons is so dark, and hard to be understood, that, when we
come to apply it, it concerns us to remember this work, that it is not
for us to be positive in determining the times and the seasons. Buxtorf
mentions a saying of the rabbin concerning the coming of the Messiah:
Rumpatur spiritus eorum qui supputant tempora - Perish the men who
calculate the time.

III\. He appoints them their work, and with authority assures them of an
ability to go on with it, and of success in it. "It is not for you to
know the times and the seasons - this would do you no good; but know
this ([Act 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008).md) that you shall receive
a spiritual power, by the descent of the Holy Ghost upon you, and shall
not receive it in vain, for you shall be witnesses unto me and my glory;
and your testimony shall not be in vain, for it shall be received here
in Jerusalem, in the country about, and all the world over," [Act
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008.md). If Christ make us serviceable to
his honour in our own day and generation, let this be enough for us, and
let not us perplex ourselves about times and seasons to come. Christ
here tells them,

1\. That their work should be honourable and glorious: You shall be
witnesses unto me. (1.) They shall proclaim him king, and publish those
truths to the world by which his kingdom should be set up, and he would
rule. They must openly and solemnly preach his gospel to the world. (2.)
They shall prove this, shall confirm their testimony, not as witnesses
do, with an oath, but with the divine seal of miracles and supernatural
gifts: You shall be martyrs to me, or my martyrs, as some copies read
it; for they attested the truth of the gospel with their sufferings,
even unto death.

2\. That their power for this work should be sufficient. They had not
strength of their own for it, nor wisdom nor courage enough; they were
naturally of the weak and foolish things of the world; they durst not
appear as witnesses for Christ upon his trial, neither as yet were they
able. "But you shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost coming upon
you" (so it may be read), "shall be animated and actuated by a better
spirit than your own; you shall have power to preach the gospel, and to
prove it out of the scriptures of the Old Testament" (which, when they
were filled with the Holy Ghost, they did to admiration, [Act
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#028).md), "and to confirm it both by
miracles and by sufferings." Note, Christ's witnesses shall receive
power for that work to which he calls them; those whom he employs in his
service he will qualify for it, and will bear them out in it.

3\. That their influence should be great and very extensive: "You shall
be witnesses for Christ, and shall carry his cause," (1.) "In Jerusalem;
there you must begin, and many there will receive your testimony; and
those that do not will be left inexcusable." (2.) "Your light shall
thence shine throughout all Judea, where before you have laboured in
vain." (3.) "Thence you shall proceed to Samaria, though at your first
mission you were forbidden to preach in any of the cities of the
Samaritans." (4.) "Your usefulness shall reach to the uttermost part of
the earth, and you shall be blessings to the whole world."

IV\. Having left these instructions with them, he leaves them ([Act
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#009).md): When he had spoken these things,
and had said all that he had to say, he blessed them (so we were told,
[Luk 24:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#050).md); and while they beheld
him, and had their eye fixed upon him, receiving his blessing, he was
gradually taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight. We have
here Christ's ascending on high; not fetched away, as Elijah was, with a
chariot of fire and horses of fire, but rising to heaven, as he rose
from the grave, purely by his own power, his body being now, as the
bodies of the saints will be at the resurrection, a spiritual body, and
raised in power and incorruption. Observe, 1. He began his ascension in
the sight of his disciples, even while they beheld. They did not see him
come up out of the grave, because they might see him after he had risen,
which would be satisfaction enough; but they saw him go up towards
heaven, and had actually their eye upon him with so much care and
earnestness of mind that they could not be deceived. It is probable that
he did not fly swiftly up, but moved upwards gently, for the further
satisfaction of his disciples. 2. He vanished out of their sight, in a
cloud, either a thick cloud, for God said that he would dwell in the
thick darkness; or a bright cloud, to signify the splendour of his
glorious body. It was a bright cloud that overshadowed him in his
transfiguration, and most probably this was so, [Mat
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#005.md). This cloud received him, it is
probable, when he had gone about as far from the earth as the clouds
generally are; yet it was not such a spreading cloud as we commonly see,
but such as just served to enclose him. Now he made the clouds his
chariot, [Psa 104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003.md). God had often
come down in a cloud; now he went up in one. Dr. Hammond thinks that the
clouds receiving him here were the angels receiving him; for the
appearance of angels is ordinarily described by a cloud, comparing [Exo
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022.md) with [Lev
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#002.md). By the clouds there is a sort of
communication kept up between the upper and lower world; in them the
vapours are sent up from the earth, and the dews sent down from heaven.
Fitly therefore does he ascend in a cloud who is the Mediator between
God and man, by whom God's mercies come down upon us and our prayers
come up to him. This was the last that was seen of him. The eyes of a
great many witnesses followed him into the cloud; and, if we would know
what became of him then, we may find ([Dan
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013).md), That one like the Son of man
came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and
they brought him in the clouds as he came near before him.

V. The disciples, when he had gone out of their sight, yet still
continued looking up stedfastly to heaven ([Act
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#010).md), and this longer than it was fit
they should; and why so? 1. Perhaps they hoped that Christ would
presently come back to them again, to restore the kingdom to Israel, and
were loth to believe they should now part with him for good and all; so
much did they still dote upon his bodily presence, though he had told
them that it was expedient for them that he should go away. or, they
looked after him, as doubting whether he might not be dropped, as the
sons of the prophets thought concerning Elijah ([Kg2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#016).md), and so they might have him
again. 2. Perhaps they expected to see some change in the visible
heavens now upon Christ's ascension, that either the sun should be
ashamed or the moon confounded ([Isa
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023).md), as being out-shone by his
lustre; or, rather, that they should show some sign of joy and triumph;
or perhaps they promised themselves a sight of the glory of the
invisible heavens, upon their opening to receive him. Christ had told
them that hereafter they should see heaven opened ([Joh
1:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#051).md), and why should not they expect
it now?

VI\. Two angels appeared to them, and delivered them a seasonable
message from God. There was a world of angels ready to receive our
Redeemer, now that he made his public entry into the Jerusalem above: we
may suppose these two loth to be absent then; yet, to show how much
Christ had at heart the concerns of his church on earth, he sent back to
his disciples two of those that came to meet him, who appear as two men
in white apparel, bright and glittering; for they know, according to the
duty of their place, that they are really serving Christ when they are
ministering to his servants on earth. Now we are told what the angels
said to them, 1. To check their curiosity: You men of Galilee, why stand
you gazing up into heaven? He calls them men of Galilee, to put them in
mind of the rock out of which they were hewn. Christ had put a great
honour upon them, in making them his ambassadors; but they must remember
that they are men, earthen vessels, and men of Galilee, illiterate men,
looked upon with disdain. Now, say they, "Why stand you here, like
Galileans, rude and unpolished men, gazing up into heaven? What would
you see? You have seen all that you were called together to see, and why
do you look any further? Why stand you gazing, as men frightened and
perplexed, as men astonished and at their wits' end?" Christ's disciples
should never stand at a gaze, because they have a sure rule to go by,
and a sure foundation to build upon. 2. To confirm their faith
concerning Christ's second coming. Their Master had often told them of
this, and the angels are sent at this time seasonably to put them in
mind of it: "This same Jesus, who is taken up from you into heaven, and
whom you are looking thus long after, wishing you had him with you
again, is not gone for ever; for there is a day appointed in which he
will come in like manner thence, as you have seen him go thither, and
you must not expect him back till that appointed day." (1.) "This same
Jesus shall come again in his own person, clothed with a glorious body;
this same Jesus, who came once to put away sin by the sacrifice of
himself, will appear a second time without sin ([Heb
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026.md), [Heb
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028).md), who came once in disgrace to be
judged, will come again in glory to judge. The same Jesus who has given
you your charge will come again to call you to an account how you have
performed your trust; he, and not another," [Job
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#027). (2..md) "He shall come in like
manner. He is gone away in a cloud, and attended with angels; and,
behold, he comes in the clouds, and with him an innumerable company of
angels! He is gone up with a shout and with the sound of a trumpet ([Psa
47:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#005).md), and he will descend from heaven
with a shout and with the trump of God, [Th1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016.md). You have now lost the sight of
him in the clouds and in the air; and whither he is gone you cannot
follow him now, but shall then, when you shall be caught up in the
clouds, to meet the Lord in the air." When we stand gazing and trifling,
the consideration of our Master's second coming should quicken and
awaken us; and, when we stand gazing and trembling, the consideration of
it should comfort and encourage us.

[Acts 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 1:12</span></span>

We are here told, I. Whence Christ ascended - from the mount of Olives
([Act 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#012).md), from that part of it
where the town of Bethany stood, [Luk
24:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#050.md). There he began his sufferings
([Luk 22:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#039).md), and therefore there he
rolled away the reproach of them by his glorious ascension, and thus
showed that his passion and his ascension had the same reference and
tendency. Thus would he enter upon his kingdom in the sight of
Jerusalem, and of those undutiful ungrateful citizens of his that would
not have him to reign over them. It was prophesied of him ([Zac
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#004).md), That his feet should stand upon
the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem, should stand last there;
and presently it follows, The mount of Olives shall cleave in two. From
the mount of Olives he ascended who is the good olive-tree, whence we
receive the unction, [Zac 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#012.md); [Rom
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#024.md). This mount is here said to be
near Jerusalem, a sabbath day's journey from it, that is, a little way;
no further than devout people used to walk out on a sabbath evening,
after the public worship was over, for meditation. Some reckon it a
thousand paces, others two thousand cubits; some seven furlongs, others
eight. Bethany indeed was fifteen furlongs from Jerusalem ([Joh
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#018).md), but that part of the mount of
Olives which was next to Jerusalem, whence Christ began to ride in
triumph, was but seven or eight furlongs off. The Chaldee paraphrast on
Ruth 1 says, We are commanded to keep the sabbaths and the holy days, so
as not to go above two thousand cubits, which they build upon [Jos
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#004.md), where, in their march through
Jordan, the space between them and the ark was to be two thousand
cubits. God had not then thus limited them, but they limited themselves;
and thus far it is a rule to us, not to journey on the sabbath any more
than in order to the sabbath work; and as far as is necessary to this we
are not only allowed, but enjoined, [Kg2
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#023.md).

II\. Whither the disciples returned: They came to Jerusalem, according
to their Master's appointment, though there they were in the midst of
enemies; but it should seem that though immediately after Christ's
resurrection they were watched, and were in fear of the Jews, yet after
it was known that they were gone into Galilee no notice was taken of
their return to Jerusalem, nor any further search made for them. God can
find out hiding-places for his people in the midst of their enemies, and
so influence Saul that he shall not seek for David any more. At
Jerusalem they went up into an upper room, and there abode; not that
they all lodged and dieted together in one room, but there they
assembled every day, and spent time together in religious exercises, in
expectation of the descent of the Spirit. Divers conjectures the learned
have about this upper room. Some think it was one of the upper rooms in
the temple; but it cannot be thought that the chief priests, who had the
letting of these rooms, would suffer Christ's disciples constantly to
reside in any of them. It was said indeed, by the same historian, that
they were continually in the temple ([Luk
24:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#053).md), but that was in the courts of
the temple, at the hours of prayer, where they could not be hindered
from attending; but, it should seem, this upper room was in a private
house. Mr. Gregory, of Oxford, is of this opinion, and quotes a Syriac
scholiast upon this place, who says that it was the same upper room in
which they had eaten the passover; and though that was called anōgeon,
this huperōon, both may signify the same. "Whether," says he, "it was in
the house of St. John the evangelist, as Euodius delivered, or that of
Mary the mother of John Mark, as others have collected, cannot be
certain." Notes, ch. 12.

III\. Who the disciples were, that kept together. The eleven apostles
are here named ([Act 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013).md), so is Mary
the mother of our Lord ([Act 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#014).md),
and it is the last time that ever any mention is made of her in the
scriptures. There were others that are here said to be the brethren of
our Lord, his kinsmen according to the flesh; and, to make up the
hundred and twenty spoken of ([Act
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015).md), we may suppose that all or most
of the seventy disciples were with them, that were associates with the
apostles, and were employed as evangelists.

IV\. How they spent their time: They all continued with one accord in
prayer and supplication. Observe, 1. They prayed, and made supplication.
All God's people are praying people, and give themselves to prayer. It
was now a time of trouble and danger with the disciples of Christ; they
were as sheep in the midst of wolves; and, Is any afflicted? Let him
pray; this will silence cares and fears. They had new work before them,
great work, and, before they entered upon it, they were instant in
prayer to God for his presence with them in it. Before they were first
sent forth Christ spent time in prayer for them, and now they spent time
in prayer for themselves. They were waiting for the descent of the
Spirit upon them, and therefore abounded thus in prayer. The Spirit
descended upon our Saviour when he was praying, [Luk
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#021.md). Those are in the best frame to
receive spiritual blessings that are in a praying frame. Christ had
promised now shortly to send the Holy Ghost; now this promise was not to
supersede prayer, but to quicken and encourage it. God will be enquired
of for promised mercies, and the nearer the performance seems to be the
more earnest we should be in prayer for it. 2. They continued in prayer,
spent much time in it, more than ordinary, prayed frequently, and were
long in prayer. They never missed an hour of prayer; they resolved to
persevere herein till the Holy Ghost came, according to the promise, to
pray, and not to faint. It is said ([Luk
24:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#053).md), They were praising and
blessing God; here, They continued in prayer and supplication; for as
praise for the promise is a decent way of begging for the performance,
and praise for former mercy of begging further mercy, so, in seeking to
God, we give him the glory of the mercy and grace which we have found in
him. 3. They did this with one accord. This intimates that they were
together in holy love, and that there was no quarrel nor discord among
them; and those who so keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace
are best prepared to receive the comforts of the Holy Ghost. It also
intimates their worthy concurrence in the supplications that were made;
though but one spoke, they all prayed, and if, when two agree to ask, it
shall be done for them, much more when many agree in the same petition.
See [Mat 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#019.md).

[Acts 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 1:15</span></span>

The sin of Judas was not only his shame and ruin, but it made a vacancy
in the college of the apostles. They were ordained twelve, with an eye
to the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from the twelve patriarchs;
they were the twelve stars that make up the church's crown ([Rev
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#001).md), and for them twelve thrones
were designated, [Mat 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028.md). Now being
twelve when they were learners, if they were but eleven when they were
to be teachers, it would occasion every one to enquire what had become
of the twelfth, and so revive the remembrance of the scandal of their
society; and therefore care was taken, before the descent of the Spirit,
to fill up the vacancy, of the doing of which we now have an account,
our Lord Jesus, probably, having given directions about it, among other
things which he spoke pertaining to the kingdom of God. Observe,

I. The persons concerned in this affair. 1. The house consisted of about
a hundred and twenty. This was the number of the names, that is, the
persons; some think the men only, distinguished from the women. Dr.
Lightfoot reckons that the eleven apostles, the seventy disciples, and
about thirty-nine more, all of Christ's own kindred, country, and
concourse, made up this one hundred and twenty, and that these were a
sort of synod, or congregation of ministers, a standing presbytery ([Act
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#023).md), to whom none of the rest durst
join themselves ([Act 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#013).md), and that
they continued together till the persecution at Stephen's death
dispersed them all but the apostles ([Act
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001).md); but he thinks that besides these
there were many hundreds in Jersualem, if not thousands, at this time,
that believed; and we have indeed read of many that believed on him
there, but durst not confess him, and therefore I cannot think, as he
does, that they were now formed into distinct congregations, for the
preaching of the word and other acts of worship; nor that there was any
thing of this till after the pouring out of the Spirit, and the
conversions recorded in the following chapter. Here was the beginning of
the Christian church: this hundred and twenty was the grain of
mustard-seed that grew into a tree, the leaven that leavened the whole
lump. 2. The speaker was Peter, who had been, and still was, the most
forward man; and therefore notice is taken of his forwardness and zeal,
to show that he had perfectly recovered the ground he lost by his
denying his Master, and, Peter being designed to be the apostle of the
circumcision, while the sacred story stays among the Jews, he is still
brought in, as afterwards, when it comes to speak of the Gentiles, it
keeps to the story of Paul.

II\. The proposal which Peter made for the choice of another apostle. He
stood up in the midst of the disciples, [Act
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015.md). He did not sit down, as one that
gave laws, or had any supremacy over the rest, but stood up, as one that
had only a motion to make, in which he paid a deference to his brethren,
standing up when he spoke to them. Now in his speech we may observe,

1\. The account he gives of the vacancy made by the death of Judas, in
which he is very particular, and, as became one that Christ had breathed
upon, takes notice of the fulfilling of the scriptures in it. Here is,

(1.) The power to which Judas had been advanced ([Act
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#017).md): He was numbered with us, and
had obtained part of this ministry which we are invested with. Note,
Many are numbered with the saints in this world that will not be found
among them in the day of separation between the precious and the vile.
What will it avail us to be added to the number of Christians, if we
partake not of the spirit and nature of Christians? Judas's having
obtained part of this ministry was but an aggravation of his sin and
ruin, as it will be of theirs who prophesied in Christ's name, and yet
were workers of iniquity.

(2.) The sin of Judas, notwithstanding his advancement to this honour.
He was guide to those that took Jesus, not only informed Christ's
persecutors where they might find him (which they might have done
effectually though he had kept out of sight), but he had the impudence
to appear openly at the head of the party that seized him. He went
before them to the place, and, as if he had been proud of the honour,
gave the word of command: That same is he, hold him fast. Note,
Ringleaders in sin are the worst of sinners, especially if those that by
their office should have been guides to the friends of Christ are guides
to his enemies.

(3.) The ruin of Judas by this sin. Perceiving the chief priests to seek
the life of Christ and his disciples, he thought to save his by going
over to them, and not only so, but to get an estate under them, of which
his wages for his service, he hoped, would be but an earnest; but see
what came of it. \[1.\] He lost his money shamefully enough ([Act
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#018).md): He purchased a field with the
thirty pieces of silver, which were the reward of his iniquity. He did
not purchase the field, but the wages of his unrighteousness did, and it
is very elegantly expressed thus, in derision of his projects to enrich
himself by this bargain. He thought to have purchased a field for
himself, as Gehazi did with what he got from Naaman by a lie (see [Kg2
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#026).md), but it proved the purchase of a
field to bury strangers in; and what was he or any of his the better for
this? It was to him an unrighteous mammon, it deceived him; and the
reward of his iniquity was the stumbling-block of his iniquity. \[2.\]
He lost his life m ore shamefully. We were told ([Mat
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#005).md) that he went away in despair,
and was suffocated (so the word signifies there, and no more); here it
is added (as latter historians add to those who went before) that, being
strangled, or choked with grief and horror, he fell headlong, fell on
his face (so Dr. Hammond), and partly with the swelling of his own
breast, and partly with the violence of the fall, he burst asunder in
the midst, so that all his bowels tumbled out. If, when the devil was
cast out of a child, he tore him, threw him down, and rent him, and
almost killed him (as we find [Mar
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#026.md); [Luk
9:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#042).md), no wonder if, when he had full
possession of Judas, he threw him headlong, and burst him. The
suffocation of him, which Matthew relates, would make him swell till he
burst, which Peter relates. he burst asunder with a great noise (so Dr.
Edwards), which was heard by the neighbours, and so, as it follows, it
came to be known ([Act 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#019).md): His
bowels gushed out; Luke writes like a physician, understanding all the
entrails of the middle and lower ventricle. Bowelling is part of the
punishment of traitors. Justly do those bowels gush out that were shut
up against the Lord Jesus. And perhaps Christ had an eye to the fate of
Judas, when he said of the wicked servant that he would cut him in
sunder, [Mat 24:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#051.md).

(4.) The public notice that was taken of this: It was known to all the
dwellers in Jerusalem. It was, as it were, put into the newspapers, and
was all the talk of the town, as a remarkable judgment of God upon him
that betrayed his Master, [Act 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#019.md).
It was not only discoursed of among the disciples, but it was in every
body's mouth, and nobody disputed the truth of the fact. It was known,
that is, it was known to be true, incontestably so. Now one would think
this should have awakened those to repentance that had had any hand in
the death of Christ when they saw him that had the first hand thus made
an example. But their hearts were hardened, and, as to those of them
that were to be softened, it must be done by the word, and the Spirit
working with it. Here is one proof of the notoriety of the thing
mentioned, that the field which was purchased with Judas's money was
called Aceldama - the field of blood, because it was bought with the
price of blood, which perpetuated the infamy not only of him that sold
that innocent precious blood, but of those that bought it too. Look how
they will answer it, when God shall make inquisition for blood.

(5.) The fulfilling of the scriptures in this, which had spoken so
plainly of it, that it must needs be fulfilled, [Act
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#016.md). Let none be surprised nor
stumble at it, that this should be the exit of one of the twelve, for
David had not only foretold his sin (which Christ had taken notice of,
[Joh 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#018.md), from [Psa
41:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#009.md), He that eateth bread with me
hath lifted up the heel against me), but had also foretold, \[1.\] His
punishment ([Psa 69:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#025).md): Let his
habitation be desolate. This Psalm refers to the Messiah. Mention is
made but two or three verses before of their giving him gall and
vinegar, and therefore the following predictions of the destruction of
David's enemies must be applied to the enemies of Christ, and
particularly to Judas. Perhaps he had some habitation of his own at
Jerusalem, which, upon this, every body was afraid to live in, and so it
became desolate. This prediction signifies the same with that of Bildad
concerning the wicked man, that his confidence shall be rooted out of
his tabernacle, and shall bring him to the king of terrors: it shall
dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his; brimstone shall be
scattered upon his habitation, [Job
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#014.md), [Job
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#015.md). \[2.\] The substitution of
another in his room. His bishopric, or his office (for so the word
signifies in general) shall another take, which is quoted from [Psa
109:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#008.md). With this quotation Peter very
aptly introduces the following proposal. Note, We are not to think the
worse of any office that God has instituted (whether magistracy or
ministry) either for the wickedness of any that are in that office or
for the ignominious punishment of that wickedness; nor will God suffer
any purpose of his to be frustrated, any commission of his to be
vacated, or any work of his to be undone, for the miscarriages of those
that are entrusted therewith. The unbelief of man shall not make the
promise of God of no effect. Judas is hanged, but his bishopric is not
lost. It is said of his habitation, that no man shall dwell therein,
there he shall have no heir; but it is not said so of his bishopric,
there he shall not want a successor. It is with the officers of the
church as with the members of it, if the natural branches be broken off,
others shall be grafted in, [Rom
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017.md). Christ's cause shall never be
lost for want of witnesses.

2\. The motion he makes for the choice of another apostle, [Act
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#021.md), [Act
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022). Here observe, (1..md) How the
person must be qualified that must fill the vacancy. It must be one of
these men, these seventy disciples, that have companied with us, that
have constantly attended us, all the time that the Lord Jesus went in
and out among us, preaching and working miracles for three years and a
half, beginning from the baptism of John, from which the gospel of
Christ commenced, unto that same day that he was taken up from us. Those
that have been diligent, faithful, and constant, in the discharge of
their duty in a lower station, are fittest to be preferred to a higher;
those that have been faithful in a little shall be entrusted with more.
And none should be employed as ministers of Christ, preachers of his
gospel, and rulers in his church, but those that are well acquainted
with his doctrine and doings, from first to last. None shall be an
apostle but one that has companied with the apostles, and that
continually; not that has visited them now and then, but been intimately
conversant with them. (2.) To what work he is called that must fill up
the vacancy: He must be a witness with us of his resurrection. By this
it appears that others of the disciples were with the eleven when Christ
appeared to them, else they could not have been witnesses with them, as
competent witnesses as they, of his resurrection. The great thing which
the apostles were to attest to the world was Christ's resurrection, for
this was the great proof of his being the Messiah, and the foundation of
our hope in him. See what the apostles were ordained to, not to a
secular dignity and dominion, but to preach Christ, and the power of his
resurrection.

III\. The nomination of the person that was to succeed Judas in his
office as an apostle.

1\. Two, who were known to have been Christ's constant attendants, and
men of great integrity, were set up as candidates for the place ([Act
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#023).md): They appointed two; not the
eleven, they did not take upon them to determine who should be put up,
but the hundred and twenty, for to them Peter spoke, and not to the
eleven. The two they nominated were Joseph and Matthias, of neither of
whom do we read elsewhere, except this Joseph be the same with that
Jesus who is called Justus, of whom Paul speaks ([Col
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#011).md), and who is said to be of the
circumcision, a native Jew, as this was, and who was a fellow-worker
with Paul in the kingdom of God and a comfort to him; and then it is
observable that, though he came short of being an apostle, he did not
therefore quit the ministry, but was very useful in a lower station;
for, Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Some think this Joseph is he
that is called Joses ([Mar 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#003).md), the
brother of James the less ([Mar
15:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#040).md), and was called Joses the just,
as he was called James the just. Some confound this with that Joses
mentioned [Act 4:36](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#036.md). But that was of
Cyprus, this of Galilee; and, it should seem, to distinguish them, that
was called Barnabas - a son of consolation; this Barsabas - a son of the
oath. These two were both of them such worthy men, and so well qualified
for the office, that they could not tell which of them was the fitter,
but all agreed it must be one of these two. They did not propose
themselves nor strive for the place, but humbly sat still, and were
appointed to it.

2\. They applied to God by prayer for direction, not which of the
seventy, for none of the rest could stand in competition with these in
the opinion of all present, but which of these two? [Act
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#024.md), [Act
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#025). (1..md) They appeal to God as the
searcher of hearts: "Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men,
which we do not, and better than they know their own." Observe, When an
apostle was to be chosen, he must be chosen by his heart, and the temper
and disposition of that. Yet Jesus, who knew all men's hearts, for wise
and holy ends chose Judas to be one of the twelve. It is comfortable to
us, in our prayers for the welfare of the church and its ministers, that
the God to whom we pray knows the hearts of all men, and has them not
only under his eye, but in his hand, and turns them which way soever he
will, can make them fit for his purpose, if he do not find them so, by
giving them another spirit. (2.) They desire to know which of these God
had chosen: Lord, show us this, and we are satisfied. It is fit that God
should choose his own servants; and so far as he in any way by the
disposals of his providence or the gifts of his Spirit, shows whom he
hath chosen, or what he hath chosen, for us, we ought to comply with
him. (3.) They are ready to receive him as a brother whom God hath
chosen; for they are not contriving to have so much the more dignity
themselves, by keeping out another, but desire to have one to take part
of this ministry and apostleship, to join with them in the work and
share with them in the honour, from which Judas by transgression fell,
threw himself, by deserting and betraying his Master, from the place of
an apostle, of which he was unworthy, that he might go to his own place,
the place of a traitor, the fittest place for him, not only to the
gibbet, but to hell - this was his own place. Note, Those that betray
Christ, as they fall from the dignity of relation to him, so they fall
into all misery. It is said of Balaam ([Num
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#025).md) that he went to his own place,
that is, says one of the rabbin, he went to hell. Dr. Whitby quotes
Ignatius saying, There is appointed to every man idios topos - a proper
place, which imports the same with that of God's rendering to every man
according to his works. And our Saviour had said that Judas's own place
should be such that it had been better for him that he had never been
born ([Mat 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#024).md) - his misery such as
to be worse than not being. Judas had been a hypocrite, and hell is the
proper place of such; other sinners, as inmates, have their portion with
them, [Mat 24:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#051). (4..md) The doubt was
determined by lot ([Act 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#026).md), which
is an appeal to God, and lawful to be used for determining matters not
otherwise determinable, provided it be done in a solemn religious
manner, and with prayer, the prayer of faith; for the lot is cast into
the lap, but the whole disposal thereof is of the Lord, [Pro
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#033.md). Matthias was not ordained by
the imposition of hands, as presbyters were, for he was chosen by lot,
which was the act of God; and therefore, as he must be baptized, so he
must be ordained, by the Holy Ghost, as they all were not many days
after. Thus the number of the apostles was made up, as afterwards, when
James, another of the twelve, was martyred, Paul was made an apostle.
