<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg1 10:0</span></span>

Still Solomon looks great, and every thing in this chapter adds to his
magnificence. We read nothing indeed of his charity, of no hospitals he
built, or alms-houses; he made his kingdom so rich that it did not need
them; yet, no question, many poor were relieved from the abundance of
his table. A church he had built, never to be equalled; schools or
colleges he need not build any, his own palace is an academy, and his
court a rendezvous of wise and learned men, as well as the centre of all
the circulating riches of that part of the world. I. What abundance of
wisdom there was there appears from the application the queen of Sheba
made to him, and the great satisfaction she had in her entertainment
there ([Kg1 10:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001).md), and others
likewise ([Kg1 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#024).md). II. What
abundance of wealth there was there appears here by the gold imported,
with other things, yearly ([Kg1 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#014.md),
[Kg1 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#015).md), and in a triennial return
([Kg1 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022).md). Gold presented ([Kg1
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#025).md), and gold used in targets and
shields ([Kg1 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#016.md), [Kg1
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#017).md), and vessels ([Kg1
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#021).md). A stately throne made ([Kg1
10:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#018).md). His chariots and horsemen
([Kg1 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026).md). His trade with Egypt
([Kg1 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028.md), [Kg1
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029).md). And the great plenty of silver
and cedars among his people ([Kg1
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#027).md). So that, putting all together,
it must be owned, as it is here said ([Kg1
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#023).md), that "king Solomon exceeded
all the kings of the earth for riches, and for wisdom." Yet what was he
to the King of kings? Where Christ is, by his word and Spirit, "Behold,
a greater than Solomon is there."

We have here an account of the visit which the queen of Sheba made to
Solomon, no doubt when he was in the height of his piety and prosperity.
Our Saviour calls her the queen of the south, for Sheba lay south of
Canaan. The common opinion is that it was in Africa; and the Christians
in Ethiopia, to this day, are confident that she came from their
country, and that Candace was her successor, who is mentioned [Act
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#027.md). But it is more probable that she
came from the south part of Arabia the happy. It should seem she was a
queen regent, sovereign of her country. Many a kingdom would have been
deprived of its greatest blessings if a Salique law had been admitted
into its constitution. Observe,

I. On what errand the queen of Sheba came - not to treat of trade or
commerce, to adjust the limits of their dominions, to court his alliance
for their mutual strength or his assistance against some common enemy,
which are the common occasions of the congress of crowned heads and
their interviews, but she came, 1. To satisfy her curiosity; for she had
heard of his fame, especially for wisdom, and she came to prove him,
whether he was so great a man as he was reported to be, [Kg1
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001.md). Solomon's fleet sailed near the
coast of her country, and probably might put in there for fresh water;
perhaps it was thus that she heard of the fame of Solomon, that he
excelled in wisdom all the children of the east, and nothing would serve
her but she would go herself and know the truth of the report. 2. To
receive instruction from him. She came to hear his wisdom, and thereby
to improve her own ([Mat 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042).md), that
she might be the better able to govern her own kingdom by his maxims of
policy. Those whom God has called to any public employment, particularly
in the magistracy and ministry, should, by all means possible, be still
improving themselves in that knowledge which will more and more qualify
them for it, and enable them to discharge their trust well. But, it
should seem, that which she chiefly aimed at was to be instructed in the
things of God. She was religiously inclined, and had heard not only of
the fame of Solomon, but concerning the name of the Lord ([Kg1
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001).md), the great name of that God whom
Solomon worshipped and from whom he received his wisdom, and with this
God she desired to be better acquainted. Therefore does our Saviour
mention her enquiries after God, by Solomon, as an aggravation of the
stupidity of those who enquire not after God by our Lord Jesus Christ,
though he, having lain in his bosom, was much better able to instruct
them.

II\. With what equipage she came, with a very great retinue, agreeable
to her rank, intending to try Solomon's wealth and generosity, as well
as his wisdom, what entertainment he could and would give to a royal
visitant, [Kg1 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#002.md). Yet she came not
as one begging, but brought enough to bear her charges, and abundantly
to recompense Solomon for his attention to her, nothing mean or common,
but gold, and precious stones, and spices, because she came to trade for
wisdom, which she would purchase at any rate.

III\. What entertainment Solomon gave her. He despised not the weakness
of her sex, blamed her not for leaving her own business at home to come
so long a journey, and put herself and him to so much trouble and
expense merely to satisfy her curiosity; but he made her welcome and all
her train, gave her liberty to put all her questions, though some
perhaps were frivolous, some captious, and some over-curious; he allowed
her to commune with him of all that was in her heart ([Kg1
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#002).md) and gave her a satisfactory
answer to all her questions ([Kg1
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#003).md), whether natural, moral,
political, or divine. Were they designed to try him? he gave them such
turns as abundantly satisfied her of his uncommon knowledge. Were they
designed for her own instruction? (as we suppose most of them were), she
received abundant instruction from him, and he made things surprisingly
easy which she apprehended insuperably difficult, and satisfied her that
there was a divine sentence in the lips of this king. But he informed
her no doubt, with particular care, concerning God, and his law and
instituted worship. He had taken it for granted ([Kg1
8:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#042).md) that strangers would hear of his
great name, and would come thither to enquire after him; and now that so
great a stranger came we may be sure he was not wanting to assist and
encourage her enquiries, and give her a description of the temple, and
the officers and services of it, that she might be persuaded to serve
the Lord whom she now sought.

IV\. How she was affected with what she saw and heard in Solomon's
court. Divers things are here mentioned which she admired, the buildings
and furniture of his palace, the provision that was made very day for
his table (when she saw that perhaps she wondered where there were
mouths for all that meat, but when she saw the multitude of his
attendants and guests she was as ready to wonder where was the meat for
all those mouths), the orderly sitting of his servants, every one in his
place, and the ready attendance of his ministers, without any confusion,
their rich liveries, and the propriety with which his cup-bearers waited
at his table. These things she admired, as adding much to his
magnificence. But, above all these, the first thing mentioned (which
contained all) is his wisdom ([Kg1
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#004).md), of the transcendency of which
she now had incontestable proofs: and the last thing mentioned, which
crowned all, is his piety, the ascent by which he went up to the house
of the Lord, with what gravity and seriousness, and an air of devotion
in his countenance, he appeared, when he went to the temple to worship
God, with as much humility then as majesty at other times. Many of the
ancient versions read it, The burnt-offerings which he offered in the
house of the Lord; she observed with what a generous bounty he brought
his sacrifices, and with what a pious fervour he attended the offering
of them; never did she see so much goodness with so much greatness.
Every thing was so surprising that there was no more spirit in her, but
she stood amazed; she had never seen the like.

V. How she expressed herself upon this occasion. 1. She owned her
expectation far out-done, though it was highly raised by the report she
heard, [Kg1 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#006.md), [Kg1
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#007.md). She is far from repenting her
journey or calling herself a fool for undertaking it, but acknowledges
it was well worth her while to come so far for the sight of that which
she could not believe the report of. Usually things are represented to
us, both by common fame and by our own imagination, much greater than we
find them when we come to examine them; but here the truth exceeded both
fame and fancy. Those who, through grace, are brought to experience the
delights of communion with God will say that the one-half was not told
them of the pleasures of Wisdom's ways and the advantages of her gates.
Glorified saints, much more, will say that it was a true report which
they heard of the happiness of heaven, but that the thousandth part was
not told them, [Co1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009.md). 2. She
pronounced those happy that constantly attended him, and waited on him
at table: "Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants ([Kg1
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#008).md); they may improve their own
wisdom by hearing thine." She was tempted to envy them and to which
herself one of them. Note, It is a great advantage to be in good
families, and to have opportunity of frequent converse with those that
are wise, and good, and communicative. Many have this happiness who know
not how to value it. With much more reason may we say this of Christ's
servants, Blessed are those that dwell in his house, they will be still
praising him. 3. She blessed God, the giver of Solomon's wisdom and
wealth, and the author of his advancement, who had made him king, (1.)
In kindness to him, that he might have the larger opportunity of doing
good with his wisdom: He delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of
Israel, [Kg1 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#009.md). Solomon's
preferment began in the prophet's calling him Jedidiah, because the Lord
loved him, [Sa2 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#025.md). It more than
doubles our comforts if we have reason to hope they come from God's
delight in us. It was his pleasure concerning thee (so it may be read)
to set thee on the throne, not for thy merit's sake, but because it so
seemed good unto him. (2.) In kindness to the people, because the Lord
loved Israel for ever, designed them a lasting bliss, long to survive
him that laid the foundations of it. "He has made thee king, not that
thou mayest live in pomp and pleasure, and do what thou wilt, but to do
judgment and justice." This she kindly reminded Solomon of, and no doubt
he took it kindly. Both magistrates and ministers must be more
solicitous to do the duty of their places than to secure the honours and
profits of them. To this she attributes his prosperity, not to his
wisdom, for bread is not always to the wise ([Ecc
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#011).md), but whoso doeth judgment and
justice, it shall be well with him, [Jer
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#015.md). Thus giving of thanks must be
made for kings, for good kings, for such kings; they are what God makes
them to be.

VI\. How they parted. 1. She made a noble present to Solomon of gold and
spices, [Kg1 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#010.md). David had foretold
concerning Solomon that to him should be given of the gold of Sheba,
[Psa 72:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015.md). The present of gold and
spices which the wise men of the east brought to Christ was signified by
this, [Mat 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#011.md). Thus she paid for the
wisdom she had learned and did not think she bought it dearly. Let those
that are taught of God give him their hearts, and the present will be
more acceptable than this of gold and spices. Mention is made of the
great abundance Solomon had of his own, notwithstanding she presented
and he accepted this gold. What we present to Christ he needs not, but
will have us so to express our gratitude. The almug-trees are here
spoken of ([Kg1 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#011.md), [Kg1
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#012).md) as extraordinary, because
perhaps much admired by the queen of Sheba. 2. Solomon was not
behind-hand with her: He gave her whatsoever, she asked, patterns, we
may suppose, of those things that were curious, by which she might make
the like; or perhaps he gave her his precepts of wisdom and piety in
writing, besides that which he gave her of his royal bounty, [Kg1
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#013.md). Thus those who apply to our
Lord Jesus will find him not only greater than Solomon, and wiser, but
more kind; whatsoever we ask, it shall be done for us; nay, he will, out
of his divine bounty, which infinitely exceeds royal bounty, even
Solomon's, do for us more than we are able to ask or think.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 10:14</span></span>

We have here a further account of Solomon's prosperity.

I. How he increased his wealth. Though he had much, he still coveted to
have more, being willing to try the utmost the things of this world
could do to make men happy. 1. Besides the gold that came from Ophir
([Kg1 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#028).md), he brought so much into
his country from other places that the whole amounted, every year, to
666 talents ([Kg1 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#014).md), an ominous
number, compare [Rev 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#018.md), and [Ezr
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#013.md). 2. He received a great deal in
customs from the merchants, and in land-taxes from the countries his
father had conquered and made tributaries to Israel, [Kg1
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#015.md). 3. He was Hiram's partner in a
Tharshish fleet, of and for Tyre, which imported once in three years,
not only gold, and silver, and ivory, substantial goods and serviceable,
but apes to play with and peacocks to please the eye with their
feathers, [Kg1 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022.md). I wish this may
not be an evidence that Solomon and his people, being overcharged with
prosperity, by this time grew childish and wanton. 4. He had presents
made him, every year, from the neighbouring princes and great men, to
engage the continuance of his friendship, not so much because they
feared him or were jealous of him as because they loved him and admired
his wisdom, had often occasion to consult him as an oracle, and sent him
these presents by way of recompence for his advice in politics, and
(whether it became his grandeur and generosity or no we will not
enquire) he took all that came, even garments and spices, horses and
mules, [Kg1 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#024.md), [Kg1
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#025.md). 5. He traded to Egypt for
horses and linen-yarn (or, as some read it, linen-cloth), the staple
commodities of that country, and had his own merchants or factors whom
he employed in this traffic and who were accountable to him, [Kg1
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028.md), [Kg1
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028.md). The custom to be paid to the
king of Egypt for exported chariots and horses out of Egypt was very
high, but (as bishop Patrick understands it) Solomon, having married his
daughter, got him to compound for the customs, so that he could bring
them up cheaper than his neighbours, which obliged them to buy them of
him, which he was wise enough no doubt to make his advantage of. This
puts an honour upon the trading part of a nation, and sets a tradesman
not so much below a gentleman as some place him, that Solomon, one of
the greatest men that ever was, thought it no disparagement to him to
deal in trade. In all labour there is profit.

II\. What use he made of his wealth. He did not hoard it up in his
coffers, that he might have it to look upon and leave behind him. He
has, in his Ecclesiastes, so much exposed the folly of hoarding that we
cannot suppose he would himself be guilty of it. No, God that had given
him riches, and wealth, and honour, gave him also power to eat thereof,
and to take his portion, [Ecc 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#019.md).

1\. He laid out his gold in fine things for himself, which he might the
better be allowed to do when he had before laid out so much in fine
things for the house of God. (1.) He made 200 targets, and 300 shields,
of beaten gold ([Kg1 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#016.md), [Kg1
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#017).md), not for service, but for
state, to be carried before him when he appeared in pomp. With us,
magistrates have swords and maces carried before them, as the Romans had
their rods and axes, in token of their power to correct and punish the
bad, to whom they are to be a terror. But Solomon had shields and
targets carried before him, to signify that he took more pleasure in
using his power for the defence and protection of the good, to whom he
would be a praise. Magistrates are shields of the earth. (2.) He made a
stately throne, on which he sat, to give laws to his subjects, audience
to ambassadors, and judgment upon appeals, [Kg1
10:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#018.md). It was made of ivory, or
elephants' teeth, which was very rich; and yet, as if he had so much
gold that he knew not what to do with it, he overlaid that with gold,
the best gold. Yet some think he did not cover the ivory all over, but
here and there. He rolled it, flowered it, or inlaid it, with gold. The
stays or arms of this stately chair were supported by the images of
lions in gold; so were the steps and paces by which he went up to it, to
be a memorandum to him of that courage and resolution wherewith he ought
to execute judgment, not fearing the face of man. The righteous, in that
post, is bold as a lion. (3.) He made all his drinking vessels, and all
the furniture of his table, even at his country seat, of pure gold, [Kg1
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#021.md). He did not grudge himself what
he had, but took the credit and comfort of it, such as it was. That is
good that does us good.

2\. He made it circulate among his subjects, so that the kingdom was as
rich as the king; for he had no separate interests of his own to
consult, but sought the welfare of his people. Those princes are not
governed by Solomon's maxims who think it policy to keep their subjects
poor. Solomon was herein a type of Christ, who is not only rich himself,
but enriches all that are his. Solomon was instrumental to bring so much
gold into the country, and disperse it, that silver was nothing
accounted of, [Kg1 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#021.md). There was
such plenty of it in Jerusalem that it was as the stones; and cedars,
that used to be great rarities, were as common as sycamore trees, [Kg1
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#027.md). Such is the nature of worldly
wealth, plenty of it makes it the less valuable; much more should the
enjoyment of spiritual riches lessen our esteem of all earthly
possessions. If gold in abundance would make silver to seem so
despicable, shall not wisdom, and grace, and the foretastes of heaven,
which are far better than gold, make earthly wealth seem much more
despicable?

Lastly, Well, thus rich, thus great, was Solomon, and thus did he exceed
all the kings of the earth, [Kg1
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#023.md). Now let us remember, 1. That
this was he who, when he was setting out in the world, did not ask for
the wealth and honour of it, but asked for a wise and understanding
heart. The more moderate our desires are towards earthly things the
better qualified we are for the enjoyment of them and the more likely to
have them. See, in Solomon's greatness, the performance of God's promise
([Kg1 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#013).md), and let it encourage us
to seek first the righteousness of God's kingdom. 2. That this was he
who, having tasted all these enjoyments, wrote a whole book to show the
vanity of all worldly things and the vexation of spirit that attends
them, their insufficiency to make us happy and the folly of setting our
hearts upon them, and to recommend to us the practice of serious
godliness, as that which is the whole of man, and will do infinitely
more towards the making of us easy and happy than all the wealth and
power that he was master of, and which, through the grace of God, is
within our reach, when the thousandth part of Solomon's greatness is a
thousand times more than we can ever be so vain as to promise ourselves
in this world.
