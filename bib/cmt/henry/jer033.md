### [Jeremiah Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 33:0</span></span>

The scope of this chapter is much the same with that of the foregoing
chapter - to confirm the promise of the restoration of the Jews,
notwithstanding the present desolations of their country and dispersions
of their people. And these promises have, both in type and tendency, a
reference as far forward as to the gospel church, to which this second
edition of the Jewish church was at length to resign its dignities and
privileges. It is here promised, I. That the city shall be rebuilt and
re-established "in statu quo - in its former state" ([Jer
33:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001).md). II. That the captives, having
their sins pardoned, shall be restored ([Jer
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#007.md), [Jer
33:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#008).md). III. That this shall redound
very much to the glory of God ([Jer
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#009).md). IV. That the country shall have
both joy and plenty ([Jer 33:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#010).md).
V. That way shall be made for the coming of the Messiah ([Jer
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015.md), [Jer
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#016).md). VI. That the house of David,
the house of Levi, and the house of Israel, shall flourish again, and be
established, and all three in the kingdom of Christ; a gospel ministry
and the gospel church shall continue while the world stands ([Jer
33:17-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#017).md).

[Jeremiah 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 33:1</span></span>

Observe here, I. The date of this comfortable prophecy which God
entrusted Jeremiah with. It is not exact in the time, only that it was
after that in the foregoing chapter, when things were still growing
worse and worse; it was the second time. God speaketh once, yea, twice,
for the encouragement of his people. We are not only so disobedient that
we have need of precept upon precept to bring us to our duty, but so
distrustful that we have need of promise upon promise to bring us to our
comfort. This word, as the former, came to Jeremiah when he was in
prison. Note, No confinement can deprive God's people of his presence;
no locks nor bars can shut out his gracious visits; nay, oftentimes as
their afflictions abound their consolations much more abound, and they
have the most reviving communications of his favour when the world
frowns upon them. Paul's sweetest epistles were those that bore date out
of a prison.

II\. The prophecy itself. A great deal of comfort is wrapped up in it
for the relief of the captives, to keep them from sinking into despair.
Observe,

1\. Who it is that secures this comfort to them ([Jer
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#002).md): It is the Lord, the maker
thereof, the Lord that framed it, He is the maker and former of heaven
and earth, and therefore has all power in his hands; so it refers to
Jeremiah's prayer, [Jer 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#017.md). He is
the maker and former of Jerusalem, of Zion, built them at first, and
therefore can rebuild them - built them for his own praise, and
therefore will. He formed it, to establish it, and therefore it shall be
established till those things be introduced which cannot be shaken, but
shall remain for ever. He is the maker and former of this promise; he
has laid the scheme for Jerusalem's restoration, and he that has formed
it will establish it, he that has made the promise will make it good;
for Jehovah is his name, a God giving being to his promises by the
performance of them, and when he does this he is known by that name
([Exo 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003).md), a perfecting God. When the
heavens and the earth were finished, then, and not till then, the
creator is called Jehovah, [Gen 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#004.md).

2\. How this comfort must be obtained and fetched in - by prayer ([Jer
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#003).md): Call upon me, and I will answer
them. The prophet, having received some intimations of this kind, must
be humbly earnest with God for further discoveries of his kind
intentions. He had prayed ([Jer
32:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#016).md), but he must pray again. Note,
Those that expect to receive comforts from God must continue instant in
prayer. We must call upon him, and then he will answer us. Christ
himself must ask, and it shall be given him, [Psa
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008.md). I will show thee great and mighty
things (give thee a clear and full prospect of them), hidden things,
which, though in part discovered already, yet thou knowest not, thou
canst not understand or give credit to. Or this may refer not only to
the prediction of these things which Jeremiah, if he desire it, shall be
favoured with, but to the performance of the things themselves which the
people of God, encouraged by this prediction, must pray for. Note,
Promises are given, not to supersede, but to quicken and encourage
prayer. See [Eze 36:37](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#037.md).

3\. How deplorable the condition of Jerusalem was which made it
necessary that such comforts as these should be provided for it, and
notwithstanding which its restoration should be brought about in due
time ([Jer 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#004.md), [Jer
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#005).md): The houses of this city, not
excepting those of the kings of Judah, are thrown down by the mounts, or
engines of battery, and by the sword, or axes, or hammers. It is the
same word that is used [Eze 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#009.md), With
his axes he shall break down thy towers. The strongest stateliest
houses, and those that were best furnished, were levelled with the
ground. The fifth verse comes in in a parenthesis, giving a further
instance of the present calamitous state of Jerusalem. Those that came
to fight with the Chaldeans, to beat them off from the siege, did more
hurt than good, provoked the enemy to be more fierce and furious in
their assaults, so that the houses in Jerusalem were filled with the
dead bodies of men, who died of the wounds they received in sallying out
upon the besiegers. God says that they were such as he had slain in his
anger, for the enemies' sword was his sword and their anger his anger.
But, it seems, the men that were slain were generally such as had
distinguished themselves by their wickedness, for they were the very men
for whose wickedness God did now hide himself from this city, so that he
was just in all he brought upon them.

4\. What the blessings are which God has in store for Judah and
Jerusalem, such as will redress all their grievances.

(1.) Is their state diseased? Is it wounded? God will provide
effectually for the healing of it, though the disease was thought mortal
and incurable, [Eze 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#022.md). "The whole
head is sick, and the whole heart faint ([Isa
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#005).md); but ([Jer
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#006).md) I will bring it health and cure;
I will prevent the death, remove the sickness, and set all to rights
again," [Jer 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#017.md). Note, Be the case
ever so desperate, if God undertake the cure, he will effect it. The sin
of Jerusalem was the sickness of it ([Isa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006).md); its reformation therefore will
be its recovery. And the following words tell us how that is wrought: "I
will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth; I will give it
to them in due time, and give them an encouraging prospect of it in the
mean time." Peace stands here for all good; peace and truth are peace
according to the promise and in pursuance of that: or peace and truth
are peace and the true religion, peace and the true worship of God, in
opposition to the many falsehoods and deceits by which they had been led
away from God. We may apply it more generally, and observe, \[1.\] That
peace and truth are the great subject-matter of divine revelation. These
promises here lead us to the gospel of Christ, and in that God has
revealed to us peace and truth, the method of true peace - truth to
direct us, peace to make us easy. Grace and truth, and abundance of
both, come by Jesus Christ. Peace and truth are the life of the soul,
and Christ came that we might have that life, and might have it more
abundantly. Christ rules by the power of truth ([Joh
18:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#037).md) and by it he gives abundance of
peace, [Psa 72:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#007.md); [Psa
85:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#010.md). \[2.\] That the divine
revelation of peace and truth brings health and cure to all those that
by faith receive it: it heals the soul of the diseases it has
contracted, as it is a means of sanctification, [Joh
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017.md). He sent his word and healed
them, [Psa 107:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#020.md). And it puts the
soul into good order, and keeps it in a good frame and fit for the
employments and enjoyments of the spiritual and divine life.

(2.) Are they scattered and enslaved, and is their nation laid in ruins?
"I will cause their captivity to return ([Jer
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#007).md), both that of Israel and that of
Judah" (for though those who returned under Zerubbabel were chiefly of
Judah, and Benjamin, and Levi, yet afterwards many of all the other
tribes returned), "and I will rebuild them, as I built them at first."
When they by repentance do their first works God will by their
restoration do his first works.

(3.) Is sin the procuring cause of all their troubles? That shall be
pardoned and subdued, and so the root of the judgments shall be killed,
[Jer 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#008.md). \[1.\] By sin they have
become filthy, and odious to God's holiness, but God will cleanse them,
and purify them from their iniquity. As those that were ceremonially
unclean, and were therefore shut out from the tabernacle, when they were
sprinkled with the water of purification had liberty of access to it
again, so had they to their own land, and the privileges of it, when God
had cleansed them from their iniquities. In allusion to that sprinkling,
David prays, Purge me with hyssop. \[2.\] By sin they have become
guilty, and obnoxious to his justice; but he will pardon all their
iniquities, will remove the punishment to which for sin they were bound
over. All who by sanctifying grace are cleansed from the filth of sin,
by pardoning mercy are freed from the guilt of it.

(4.) Have both their sins and their sufferings turned to the dishonour
of God? Their reformation and restoration shall redound as much to his
praise, [Jer 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#009.md). Jerusalem thus
rebuilt, Judah thus repeopled, shall be to me a name of joy, as pleasing
to God as ever they have been provoking, and a praise and an honour
before all the nations. They, being thus restored, shall glorify God by
their obedience to him, and he shall glorify himself by his favours to
them. This renewed nation shall be as much a reputation to religion as
formerly it has been a reproach to it. The nations shall hear of all the
good that God has wrought in them by his grace and of all the good he
has wrought for them by his providence. The wonders of their return out
of Babylon shall make as great a noise in the world as ever the wonders
of their deliverance out of Egypt did. and they shall fear and tremble
for all this goodness. \[1.\] The people of God themselves shall fear
and tremble; they shall be much surprised at it, shall be afraid of
offending so good a God and of forfeiting his favour. [Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005.md), They shall fear the Lord and his
goodness. \[2.\] The neighbouring nations shall fear because of the
prosperity of Jerusalem, shall look upon the growing greatness of the
Jewish nation as really formidable, and shall be afraid of making them
their enemies. When the church is fair as the moon, and clear as the
sun, she is terrible as an army with banners.

[Jeremiah 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 33:10</span></span>

Here is a further prediction of the happy state of Judah and Jerusalem
after their glorious return out of captivity, issuing gloriously at
length in the kingdom of the Messiah.

I. It is promised that the people who were long in sorrow shall again be
filled with joy. Every one concluded now that the country would lie for
ever desolate, that no beasts would be found in the land of Judah, no
inhabitant in the streets of Jerusalem, and consequently there would be
nothing but universal and perpetual melancholy ([Jer
33:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#010).md); but, though weeping may endure
for a time, joy will return. It was threatened ([Jer
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#034.md) and [Jer
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#009).md) that the voice of joy and
gladness should cease there; but here it is promised that they shall
revive again, that the voice of joy and gladness shall be heard there,
because the captivity shall be returned; for then was their mouth filled
with laughter, [Psa 126:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001.md), [Psa
126:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#002.md). 1. There shall be common joy
there, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; marriages
shall again be celebrated, as formerly, with songs, which in Babylon
they had laid aside, for their harps were hung on the willow-trees. 2.
There shall be religious joy there; temple-songs shall be revived, the
Lord's songs, which they could not sing in a strange land. There shall
be heard in their private houses, and in the cities of Judah, as well as
in the temple, the voice of those that shall say, Praise the Lord of
hosts. Note, Nothing is more the praise and honour of a people than to
have God the glory of it, the glory both of the power and of the
goodness by which it is effected; they shall prise him both as the Lord
of hosts and as the God who is good and whose mercy endures for ever.
This, though a song of old, yet, being sung upon this fresh occasion,
will be a new song. We find this literally fulfilled at their return out
of Babylon, [Ezr 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#011.md). They sang
together in praising the Lord, because he is good, for his mercy endures
for ever. The public worship of God shall be diligently and constantly
attended upon: They shall bring the sacrifice of praise to the house of
the Lord. All the sacrifices were intended for the praise of God, but
this seems to be meant of the spiritual sacrifices of humble adorations
and joyful thanksgivings, the calves of our lips ([Hos
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002).md), which shall please the Lord
better than an ox of bullock. The Jews say that in the days of the
Messiah all sacrifices shall cease but the sacrifice of praise, and to
those days this promise has a further reference.

II\. It is promised that the country, which had lain long depopulated,
shall be replenished and stocked again. It was now desolate, without man
and without beast; but, after their return, the pastures shall again be
clothed with flocks, [Psa 65:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#013.md). In
all the cities of Judah and Benjamin there shall be a habitation of
shepherds, [Jer 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#012.md), [Jer
33:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#013.md). This intimates, 1. The wealth
of the country, after their return. It shall not be a habitation of
beggars, who have nothing, but of shepherds and husbandmen, men of
substance, with good stocks upon the ground they have returned to. 2.
The peace of the country. It shall not be a habitation of soldiers, not
shall there be tents and barracks set up to lodge them, but there shall
be shepherds; tents; for they shall hear no more the alarms of war, nor
shall there be any to make even the shepherds afraid. See [Psa
144:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#013.md), [Psa
144:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#014.md). 3. The industry of the
country, and their return to their original plainness and simplicity,
from which, in the corrupt ages, they had sadly degenerated. The seed of
Jacob, in their beginning, gloried in this, that they were shepherds
([Gen 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#003).md), and so they shall now be
again, giving themselves wholly to that innocent employment, causing
their flocks to lie down ([Jer 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#012).md)
and to pass under the hands of him that telleth them ([Jer
33:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#013).md); for, though their flocks are
numerous, they are not numberless, nor shall they omit to number them,
that they may know if any be missing and may seek after it. Note, It is
the prudence of those who have ever so much of the world to keep an
account of what they have. Some think that they pass under the hand of
him that telleth them that they may be tithed, [Lev
27:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#032.md). Then we may take the comfort of
what we have when God has had his dues out of it. Now because it seemed
incredible that a people, reduced as now they were, should ever recover
such a degree of peace and plenty as this, here is subjoined a general
ratification of these promises ([Jer
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014).md): I will perform that good thing
which I have promised. Though the promise may sometimes work slowly
towards an accomplishment, it works surely. The days will come, though
they are long in coming.

III\. To crown all these blessings which God has in store for them, here
is a promise of the Messiah, and of that everlasting righteousness which
he should bring in ([Jer 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015.md), [Jer
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#016).md), and probably this is that good
thing, that great good thing, which in the latter days, days that were
yet to come, God would perform, as he had promised to Judah and Israel,
and to which their return out of captivity and their settlement again in
their own land was preparatory. From the captivity to Christ is one of
the famous periods, [Mat 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#017.md). This
promise of the Messiah we had before ([Jer
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md), [Jer
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006).md), and there it came in as a
confirmation of the promise of the shepherds whom God would set over
them, which would make one think that the promise here concerning the
shepherds and their flocks, which introduces it, is to be understood
figuratively. Christ is here prophesied of, 1. As a rightful King. He is
a branch of righteousness, not a usurper, for he grows up unto David,
descends from his loins, with whom the covenant of royalty was made, and
is that seed with whom that covenant should be established, so that his
title is unexceptionable. 2. As a righteous king, righteous in enacting
laws, waging wars, and giving judgment, righteous in vindicating those
that suffer wrong and punishing those that do wrong: He shall execute
judgment and righteousness in the land. This may point at Zerubbabel, in
the type, who governed with equity, not as Jehoiakim had done ([Jer
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#017).md); but it has a further reference
to him to whom all judgment is committed and who shall judge the world
in righteousness. 3. As a king that shall protect his subjects from all
injury. By him Judah shall be saved from wrath and the curse, and, being
so saved, Jerusalem shall dwell safely, quiet from the fear of evil, and
enjoying a holy security and serenity of mind, in a dependence upon the
conduct of this prince of peace, this prince of their peace. 4. As a
king that shall be praised by his subjects: "This is the name whereby
they shall call him" (so the Chaldee reads it, the Syriac, and vulgar
Latin); "this name of his they shall celebrate and triumph in, and by
this name they shall call upon him." It may be read, more agreeably to
the original, This is he who shall call her, The Lord our righteousness.
As Moses's altar is called Jehovah-nissi ([Exo
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#015).md), and Jerusalem Jehovah-shammah
([Eze 48:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#035).md), intimating that they
glory in Jehovah as present with them and their banner, so here the city
is called The Lord our righteousness, because they glory in Jehovah as
their righteousness. That which was before said to be the name of Christ
(says Mr. Gataker) is here made the name of Jerusalem, the city of the
Messiah, the church of Christ. He it is that imparts righteousness to
her, for he is made of God to us righteousness, and she, by bearing that
name, professes to have her whole righteousness, not from herself, but
from him. In the Lord have I righteousness and strength, [Isa
45:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024.md). And we are made the
righteousness of God in him. The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall have
this name of the Messiah so much in their mouths that they shall
themselves be called by it.

[Jeremiah 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 33:17</span></span>

Three of God's covenants, that of royalty with David and his seed, that
of the priesthood with Aaron and his seed, and that of Peculiarity with
Abraham and his seed, seemed to be all broken and lost while the
captivity lasted; but it is here promised that, notwithstanding that
interruption and discontinuance for a time, they shall all three take
place again, and the true intents and meaning of them all shall be
abundantly answered in the New Testament blessings, typified by those
conferred on the Jews after their return out of captivity.

I. The covenant of royalty shall be secured and the promises of it shall
have their full accomplishment in the kingdom of Christ, the Son of
David, [Jer 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#017.md). The throne of
Israel was overturned in the captivity; the crown had fallen from their
head; there was not a man to sit on the throne of Israel; Jeconiah was
written childless. After their return the house of David made a figure
again; but it in the Messiah that this promise is performed that David
shall never want a man to sit on the throne of Israel, and that David
shall have always a son to reign upon his throne. For as long as the man
Christ Jesus sits on the right hand of the throne of God, rules the
world, and rules it for the good of the church, to which he is a
quickening head, and glorified head over all things, as long as he is
King upon the holy hill of Zion, David does not want a successor, nor is
the covenant with him broken. When the first-begotten was brought into
the world it was declared concerning him, The Lord God shall give him
the throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of
Jacob for ever, [Luk 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032.md), [Luk
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#033.md). For the confirmation of this it
is promised, 1. That the covenant with David shall be as firm as the
ordinances of heaven, to the stability of which that of God's promise is
compared, [Jer 31:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#035.md), [Jer
31:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#036.md). There is a covenant of nature,
by which the common course of providence is settled and on which it is
founded, here called a covenant of the day and the night ([Jer
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#020.md), [Jer
33:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#025).md), because this is one of the
articles of it, That there shall be day and night in their season,
according to the distinction put between them in the creation, when God
divided between the light and the darkness, and established their mutual
succession, and a government to each, that the sun should rule by day
and the moon and stars by night ([Gen
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#004.md), [Gen
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#005.md), [Gen
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#016).md), which establishment was renewed
after the flood ([Gen 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#022).md), and has
continued ever since, [Psa 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#002.md). The
morning and the evening have both of them their regular outgoings ([Psa
65:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#008).md); the day-spring knows its place,
knows its time, and keeps both, so do the shadows of the evening; and,
while the world stands, this course shall not be altered, this covenant
shall not be broken. The ordinances of heaven and earth (of this
communication between heaven and earth, the dominion of these ordinances
of heaven upon the earth), which God has appointed ([Jer
33:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#025.md); compare [Job
38:33](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#033).md), shall never be disappointed.
Thus firm shall the covenant of redemption be with the Redeemer - God's
servant, but David our King, [Jer
33:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#021.md). This intimates that Christ
shall have a church on earth to the world's end; he shall see a seed in
which he shall prolong his days till time and day shall be no more.
Christ's kingdom is an everlasting kingdom; and when the end cometh, and
not till then, it shall be delivered up to God, even the Father. But it
intimates that the condition of it in this world shall be intermixed and
counterchanged, prosperity and adversity succeeding each other, as light
and darkness, day and night. But this is plainly taught us, that, as
sure as we may be that, though the sun will set tonight, it will rise
again tomorrow morning, whether we live to see it or no, so sure we may
be that, though the kingdom of the Redeemer in the world may for a time
be clouded and eclipsed by corruptions and persecutions, yet it will
shine forth again, and recover its lustre, in the time appointed. 2.
That the seed of David shall be as numerous as the host of heaven, that
is, the spiritual seed of the Messiah, that shall be born to him by the
efficacy of his gospel and his Spirit working with it. From the womb of
the morning he shall have the dew of their youth, to be his willing
people, [Psa 110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md). Christ's seed are
not, as David's were, his successors, but his subjects; yet the day is
coming when they also shall reign with him ([Jer
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#022).md): As the host of heaven cannot
be numbered, so will I multiply the seed of David, so that there shall
be no danger of the kingdom's being extinct, or extirpated, for want of
heirs. The children are numerous; and, if children, then heirs.

II\. The covenant of priesthood shall be secured, and the promises of
that also shall have their full accomplishment. This seemed likewise to
be forgotten during the captivity, when there was no altar, no temple
service, for the priests to attend upon; but this also shall revive. It
did so; immediately upon their coming back to Jerusalem there were
priests and Levites ready to offer burnt-offerings and to do sacrifice
continually ([Ezr 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#002.md), [Ezr
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#003).md), as is here promised, [Jer
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#018.md). But that priesthood soon grew
corrupt; the covenant of Levi was profaned (as appears [Mal
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#008).md), and in the destruction of
Jerusalem by the Romans it came to a final period. We must therefore
look elsewhere for the performance of this word, that the covenant with
the Levites, the priests, God's ministers, shall be as firm, and last as
long, as the covenant with the day and the night. And we find it
abundantly performed, 1. In the priesthood of Christ, which supersedes
that of Aaron, and is the substance of that shadow. While that great
high priest of our profession is always appearing in the presence of God
for us, presenting the virtue of his blood by which he made atonement in
the incense of his intercession, it may truly be said that the Levites
do not want a man before God to offer continually, [Heb
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#003.md), [Heb
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#017.md). He is a priest for ever. The
covenant of the priesthood is called a covenant of peace ([Num
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#012).md), of life and peace, [Mal
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#005.md). Now we are sure that this
covenant is not broken, nor in the least weakened, while Jesus Christ is
himself our life and our peace. This covenant of priesthood is here
again and again joined with that of royalty, for Christ is a priest upon
his throne, as Melchizedek. 2. In a settled gospel ministry. While there
are faithful ministers to preside in religious assemblies, and to offer
up the spiritual sacrifices of prayer and praise, the priests, the
Levites, do not want successors, and such as have obtained a more
excellent ministry. The apostle makes those that preach the gospel to
come in the room of those that served at the altar, [Co1
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#013.md), [Co1
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#014.md). 3. In all true believers, who
are a holy priesthood, a royal priesthood ([Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md), [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009).md), who are made to our God kings
and priests ([Rev 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006).md); they offer up
spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God, and themselves, in the first
place, living sacrifices. Of these Levites this promise must be
understood ([Jer 33:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#022).md), that they
shall be as numerous as the sand of the sea, the same that is promised
concerning Israel in general ([Gen
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017).md); for all God's spiritual Israel
are spiritual priests, [Rev 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009.md), [Rev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010.md); [Rev
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md), [Rev
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#015.md).

III\. The covenant of peculiarity likewise shall be secured and the
promises of that covenant shall have their full accomplishment in the
gospel Israel. Observe, 1. How this covenant was looked upon as broken
during the captivity, [Jer 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#024.md). God
asks the prophet, "Hast though not heard, and dost thou not consider,
what this people have spoken?" either the enemies of Israel, who
triumphed in the extirpation of a people that had made such a noise in
the world, or the unbelieving Israelites themselves, "this people among
whom thou dwellest;" they have broken covenant with God, and then
quarrel with him as if he had not dealt faithfully with them. The two
families which the Lord hath chosen, Israel and Judah, whereas they were
but one when he chose them, he hath even cast them off. "Thus have they
despised my people, that is, despised the privilege of being my people
as if it were a privilege of no value at all." The neighbouring nations
despised them as now no more a nation, but the ruins of a nation, and
looked upon all their honour as laid in the dust; but, 2. See how firm
the covenant stands notwithstanding, as firm as that with day and night;
sooner will God suffer day and night to cease then he will cast away the
seed of Jacob. This cannot refer to the seed of Jacob according to the
flesh, for they are cast away, but to the Christian church, in which all
these promises were to be lodged, as appears by the apostle's discourse,
[Rom 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001.md), etc. Christ is that seed of
David that is to be perpetual dictator to the seed of Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob; and, as this people shall never want such a king, so this
king shall never want such a people. Christianity shall continue in the
dominion of Christ, and the subjection of Christians to him, till day
and night come to an end. And, as a pledge of this, that promise is
again repeated, I will cause their captivity to return; and, having
brought them back, I will have mercy on them. To whom this promise
refers appears [Gal 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016.md), where all
that walk according to the gospel rule are made to be the Israel of God,
on whom peace and mercy shall be.
