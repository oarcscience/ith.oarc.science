### [1 Chronicles Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 28:0</span></span>

The account we have of David's exit, in the beginning of the first book
of Kings, does not make his sun nearly so bright as that given in this
and the following chapter, where we have his solemn farewell both to his
son and his subjects, and must own that he finished well. In this
chapter we have, I. A general convention of the states summoned to meet
([Ch1 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001).md). II. A solemn declaration
of the divine entail both of the crown and of the honour of building the
temple upon Solomon ([Ch1 28:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002).md).
III. An exhortation both to the people and to Solomon to make religion
their business ([Ch1 28:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#008).md). IV. The
model and materials delivered to Solomon for the building of the temple
([Ch1 28:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011).md). V. Encouragement
given him to undertake it and proceed in it ([Ch1
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#020.md), [Ch1
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#021).md).

[1 Chronicles 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 28:1</span></span>

A great deal of service David had done in his day, had served his
generation according to the will of God, [Act
13:36](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#036.md). But now the time draws night
that he must die, and, as a type of the Son of David, the nearer he
comes to his end the more busy he is, and does his work with all his
might. He is now a little recovered from the indisposition mentioned
[Kg1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md), when they covered him with
clothes, and he got no heat: but was cure is there for old age? He
therefore improves his recovery, as giving him an opportunity of doing
God and his country a little more service.

I. He summoned all the great men to attend him, that he might take leave
of them all together, [Ch1 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001.md). Thus
Moses did ([Deu 31:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#028).md), and Joshua,
[Jos 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#002.md); [Jos
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#001.md). David would not declare the
settlement of the crown but in the presence, and to the satisfaction, of
those that were the representatives of the people.

II\. He addressed them with a great deal of respect and tenderness. He
not only exerted himself to rise from his bed, to give them the meeting
(the occasion putting new spirits into him), but he rose out of his
chair, and stood up upon his feet ([Ch1
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002).md), in reverence to God whose will
he was to declare, and in reverence to this solemn assembly of the
Israel of God, as if he looked upon himself, though major singulis -
greater than any individual among them, yet minor universis - less than
the whole of them together. His age and infirmities, as well as his
dignity, might well have allowed him to keep his seat; but he would show
that he was indeed humbled for the pride of his heart both in the
numbers of his people and his dominion over them. It had been too much
his pleasure that they were all his servants ([Ch1
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#003).md), but now he calls them his
brethren, whom he loved, his people, whom he took care of, not his
servants, whom he had command of: Hear me, my brethren, and my people.
It becomes superiors thus to speak with affection and condescension even
to their inferiors; they will not be the less honoured for it, but the
more beloved. Thus he engages their attention to what he was about to
say.

III\. He declared the purpose he had formed to build a temple for God,
and God's disallowing that purpose, [Ch1
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002.md), [Ch1
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#003.md). This he had signified to Solomon
before, [Ch1 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#007.md), [Ch1
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#008.md). A house of rest for the ark is
here said to be a house of rest for the footstool of our God; for heaven
is his throne of glory; the earth, and the most magnificent temples that
can be built upon it, are but his footstool: so much difference is there
between the manifestations of the divine glory in the upper and lower
world. Angels surround his throne, [Isa
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md). We poor worms do but worship at
his footstool [Psa 99:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#005.md); [Psa
132:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#007.md). As an evidence of the sincerity
of his purpose to build the temple, he tells them that he had made ready
for it, but that God would not suffer him to proceed because he had
appointed other work for him to do, which was enough for one man,
namely, the managing of the wars of Israel. He must serve the public
with the sword; another must do it with the line and plummet. Times of
rest are building times, [Act 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031.md).

IV\. He produced his own title first, and then Solomon's, to the crown;
both were undoubtedly jure divino - divine. They could make out such a
title as no monarch on earth can; the Lord God of Israel chose them both
immediately, by prophecy, not providence, [Ch1
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#004.md), [Ch1
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#005.md). No right of primogeniture is
pretended. Detur digniori, non seniori - It went by worth, not by age.
1. Judah was not the eldest son of Jacob, yet God chose that tribe to be
the ruling tribe; Jacob entailed the sceptre upon it, [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md). 2. It does not appear that the
family of Jesse was the senior house of that tribe; from Judah it is
certain that it was not, for Shelah was before Pharez; whether from
Nahshon and Salmon is not certain. Ram, the father of Nahshon, had a
elder brother, [Ch1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#009.md). Perhaps so
had Boaz, Obed, and Jesse. Yet "God chose the house of my father." 3.
David was the youngest son of Jesse, yet God liked him to make him king;
so it seemed good unto him. God takes whom he likes, and likes whom he
makes like himself, as he did David, a man after his own heart. 4.
Solomon was one of the youngest sons of David, and yet God chose him to
sit upon the throne, because he was the likeliest of them all to build
the temple, the wisest and best inclined.

V. He opened to them God's gracious purposes concerning Solomon ([Ch1
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#006.md), [Ch1
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#007).md): I have chosen him to be my son.
Thus he declares the decree, that the Lord had said to Solomon, as a
type of Christ, Thou art my son ([Psa
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007).md), the son of my love; for he was
called Jedidiah, because the Lord loved him, and Christ is his beloved
Son. Of him God said, as a figure of him that was to come, 1. He shall
build my house. Christ is both the founder and the foundation of the
gospel temple. 2. I will establish his kingdom for ever. This must have
its accomplishment in the kingdom of the Messiah, which shall continue
in his hands through all the ages of time ([Isa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007.md); [Luk
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#033).md) and shall then be delivered up
to God, even the Father, yet perhaps to be delivered back to the
Redeemer for ever. As to Solomon, this promise of the establishment of
his kingdom is here made conditional: If he be constant to do my
commandments, as at this day. Solomon was now very towardly and good:
"If he continue so, his kingdom shall continue, otherwise not." Note, If
we be constant to our duty, then, and not otherwise, we may expect the
continuance of God's favour. Let those that are well taught, and begin
well, take notice of this - if they be constant, they are happy;
perseverance wears the crown, though it wins it not.

VI\. He charged them to adhere stedfastly to God and their duty, [Ch1
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#008.md). Observe, 1. The matter for this
charge: Keep, and seek for all the commandments of the Lord your God.
The Lord was their God; his commandments must be their rule; they must
have respect to them all, must make conscience of keeping them, and, in
order thereunto, must seek for them, that is, must be inquisitive
concerning their duty, search the scriptures, take advice, seek the law
at the mouth of those whose lips were to keep this knowledge, and pray
to God to teach and direct them. God's commandments will not be kept
without great care. 2. The solemnity of it. He charged them in the sight
of all Israel, who would all have notice of this public charge, and in
the audience of their God. "God is witness, and this congregation is
witness, that they have good counsel given them, and fair warning; if
they do not take it, it is their fault, and God and man will be
witnesses against them." See [Ti1
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#021.md); [Ti2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#001.md). Those that profess religion, as
they tender the favour of God and their reputation with men, must be
faithful to their profession. 3. The motive to observe this charge. It
was the way to be happy, to have the peaceable possession of this good
land themselves and to preserve the entail of it upon their children.

VII\. He concluded with a charge to Solomon himself, [Ch1
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#009.md), [Ch1
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#010.md). He was much concerned that
Solomon should be religious. He was to be a great man, but he must not
think religion below him - a wise man, and this would be his wisdom.
Observe,

1\. The charge he gives him. He must look upon God and the God of his
father, his good father, who had devoted him to God and educated him for
God. He was born in God's house and therefore bound in duty to be his,
brought up in his house and therefore bound in gratitude. Thy own
friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not. He must know God and serve
him. We cannot serve God aright if we do not know him; and in vain do we
know him if we do not serve him, serve him with heart and mind. We make
nothing of religion if we do not mind it, and make heart-work of it.
Serve him with a perfect, that is, an upright heart (for sincerity is
our gospel perfection), and with a willing mind, from a principle of
love, and as a willing people, cheerfully and with pleasure.

2\. The arguments to enforce this charge.

(1.) Two arguments of general inducement: - \[1.\] That the secrets of
our souls are open before God; he searches all hearts, even the hearts
of kings, which to men are unsearchable, [Pro
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#003.md). We must therefore be sincere,
because, if we deal deceitfully, God sees it, and cannot be imposed
upon; we must therefore employ our thoughts, and engage them in God's
service, because he fully understands all the imaginations of them, both
good and bad. \[2.\] That we are happy or miserable here, and for ever,
according as we do, or do not, serve God. If we seek him diligently, he
will be found of us, and that is enough to make us happy, [Heb
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006.md). If we forsake him, desert his
service and turn from following him, he will cast us off for ever, and
that is enough to make us miserable. Note, God never casts any off till
they have first cast him off. Here is,

(2.) One argument peculiar to Solomon ([Ch1
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#010).md): "Thou art to build a house for
the sanctuary; therefore seek and serve God, that that work may be done
from a good principle, in a right manner, and may be accepted."

3\. The means prescribed in order hereunto, and they are prescribed to
us all. (1.) Caution: Take heed; beware of every thing that looks like,
or leads to, that which is evil. (2.) Courage: Be strong, and do it. We
cannot do our work as we should unless we put on resolution, and fetch
in strength from divine grace.

[1 Chronicles 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 28:11</span></span>

As for the general charge that David gave his son to seek God and serve
him, the book of the law was, in that, his only rule, and there needed
no other; but, in building the temple, David was now to give him three
things: - 1. A model of the building, because it was to be such a
building as neither he nor his architects ever saw. Moses had a pattern
of the tabernacle shown him in the mount ([Heb
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005).md), so had David of the temple, by
the immediate hand of God upon him, [Ch1
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#019.md). It was given him in writing,
probably by the ministry of an angel, or as clearly and exactly
represented to his mind as if it had been in writing. But it is said
([Ch1 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#012).md), He had this pattern by
the Spirit. The contrivance either of David's devotion or of Solomon's
wisdom must not be trusted to in an affair of this nature. The temple
must be a sacred thing and a type of Christ; there must be in it not
only convenience and decency, but significancy: it was a kind of
sacrament, and therefore it must not be left to man's art or invention
to contrive it, but must be framed by divine institution. Christ the
true temple, the church the gospel temple, and heaven the everlasting
temple, are all framed according to the divine councils, and the plan
laid in the divine wisdom, ordained before the world for God's glory and
ours. This pattern David gave to Solomon, that he might know what to
provide and might go by a certain rule. When Christ left with his
disciples a charge to build his gospel church he gave them an exact
model of it, ordering them to observe that, and that only, which he
commanded. The particular models are here mentioned, of the porch, which
was higher than the rest, like a steeple, - then the houses, both the
holy place and the most holy, with the rooms adjoining, which were for
treasuries, chambers, and parlours, - especially the place of the
mercy-seat ([Ch1 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011).md), - of the
courts likewise, and the chambers about them, in which the dedicated
things were laid up. Bishop Patrick supposes that, among other things,
the tabernacle which Moses reared and all the utensils of it, which
there was now no further occasion for, were laid up here, signifying
that in the fulness of time all the Mosaic economy, all the rites and
ceremonies of that dispensation, should be respectfully laid aside, and
something better come in their room. He gave him a table of the courses
of the priests, patterns of the vessels of service ([Ch1
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#013).md), and a pattern of the chariot
of the cherubim, [Ch1 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#018.md). Besides
the two cherubim over the mercy-seat, there were two much larger, whose
wings reached from wall to wall ([Kg1
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#023), etc..md), and of these David here
gave Solomon the pattern, called a chariot; for the angels are the
chariots of God, [Psa 68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017.md). 2.
Materials for the most costly of the utensils of the temple. That they
might not be made any less than the patterns, he weighed out the exact
quantity for each vessel both of gold and silver, [Ch1
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#014.md). In the tabernacle there was but
one golden candlestick; in the temple there were ten ([Kg1
7:49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#049).md), besides silver ones, which, it
is supposed, were hand-candlesticks, [Ch1
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#015.md). In the tabernacle there was but
one table; but in the temple, besides that on which the show-bread was
set, there were ten others for other uses ([Ch2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#008).md), besides silver tables; for, this
house being much larger than that, it would look bare if it had not
furniture proportionable. The gold for the altar of incense is
particularly said to be refined gold ([Ch1
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#018).md), purer than any of the rest;
for that was typical of the intercession of Christ, than which nothing
is more pure and perfect. 3. Directions which way to look for help in
this great undertaking. "Fear not opposition; fear not the charge, care,
and trouble; fear not miscarrying in it, as in the case of Uzza; fear
not the reproach of the foolish builder, that began to build and was not
able to finish. Be not dismayed. (1.) God will help thee, and thou must
look up to him in the first place ([Ch1
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#020).md): The Lord God, even my God,
whom I have chosen and served, who has all along been present with me
and prospered me, and to whom, from my own experience of his power and
goodness, I recommend thee, he will be with thee, to direct, strengthen,
and prosper thee; he will not fail thee nor forsake thee." Note, We may
be sure that God, who owned our fathers and carried them through the
services of their day, will, in like manner, if we be faithful to him,
go along with us in our day, and will never leave us, while he has any
work to do in us or by us. The same that was Joshua's encouragement
([Jos 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005).md), and Solomon's, is given to
all believers, [Heb 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#005.md). He will
never leave thee, nor forsake thee. God never leaves any unless they
first leave him. (2.) "Good men will help thee, [Ch1
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#021.md). The priests and Levites will
advise thee, and thou mayest consult them. Thou hast good workmen, who
are both willing and skilful;" and these are two very good properties in
a workman, especially in those that work at the temple. And, lastly,
"The princes and the people will be so far from opposing or retarding
the work that they will be wholly at thy command, every one in his place
ready to further it." Then good work is likely to go on when all parties
concerned are hearty in it, and none secretly clog it, but all drive on
heartily in it.
