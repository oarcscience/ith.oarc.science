### [Psalms Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 36:0</span></span>

It is uncertain when, and upon what occasion, David penned this psalm,
probably when he was struck at either by Saul or by Absalom; for in it
he complains of the malice of his enemies against him, but triumphs in
the goodness of God to him. We are here led to consider, and it will do
us good to consider seriously, I. The sinfulness of sin, and how
mischievous it is ([Psa 36:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001).md). II.
The goodness of God, and how gracious he is, 1. To all his creatures in
general ([Psa 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#005.md), [Psa
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#006).md). 2. To his own people in a
special manner ([Psa 36:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#007).md). By this
the psalmist is encouraged to pray for all the saints ([Psa
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#010).md), for himself in particular and
his own preservation ([Psa 36:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#011).md), and
to triumph in the certain fall of his enemies ([Psa
36:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#012).md). If, in singing this psalm, our
hearts be duly affected with the hatred of sin and satisfaction in God's
lovingkindness, we sing it with grace and understanding.

To the chief Musician. A psalm of David the servant of the Lord.

[Psalms 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 36:1</span></span>

David, in the title of this psalm, is styled the servant of the Lord;
why in this, and not in any other, except in Ps. 18 (title), no reason
can be given; but so he was, not only as every good man is God's
servant, but as a king, as a prophet, as one employed in serving the
interests of God's kingdom among men more immediately and more eminently
than any other in his day. He glories in it, [Psa
116:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#016.md). It is no disparagement, but an
honour, to the greatest of men, to be the servants of the great God; it
is the highest preferment a man is capable of in this world.

David, in these verses, describes the wickedness of the wicked; whether
he means his persecutors in particular, or all notorious gross sinners
in general, is not certain. But we have here sin in its causes and sin
in its colours, in its root and in its branches.

I. Here is the root of bitterness, from which all the wickedness of the
wicked comes. It takes rise, 1. From their contempt of God and the want
of a due regard to him ([Psa 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001).md):
"The transgression of the wicked (as it is described afterwards, [Psa
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#003.md), [Psa
36:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#004).md) saith within my heart (makes me
to conclude within myself) that there is no fear of God before his eyes;
for, if there were, he would not talk and act so extravagantly as he
does; he would not, he durst not, break the laws of God, and violate his
covenants with him, if he had any awe of his majesty or dread of his
wrath." Fitly therefore is it brought into the form of indictments by
our law that the criminal, not having the fear of God before his eyes,
did so and so. The wicked did not openly renounce the fear of God, but
their transgression whispered it secretly into the minds of all those
that knew any thing of the nature of piety and impiety. David concluded
concerning those who lived at large that they lived without God in the
world. 2. From their conceit of themselves and a cheat they wilfully put
upon their own souls ([Psa 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#002).md): He
flattereth himself in his own eyes; that is, while he goes on in sin, he
thinks he does wisely and well for himself, and either does not see or
will not own the evil and danger of his wicked practices; he calls evil
good and good evil; his licentiousness he pretends to be but his just
liberty, his fraud passes for his prudence and policy, and his
persecuting the people of God, he suggests to himself, is a piece of
necessary justice. If his own conscience threaten him for what he does,
he says, God will not require it; I shall have peace though I go on.
Note, Sinners are self-destroyers by being self-flatterers. Satan could
not deceive them if they did not deceive themselves. Buy will the cheat
last always? No; the day is coming when the sinner will be undeceived,
when his iniquity shall be found to be hateful. Iniquity is a hateful
thing; it is that abominable thing which the Lord hates, and which his
pure and jealous eye cannot endure to look upon. It is hurtful to the
sinner himself, and therefore ought to be hateful to him; but it is not
so; he rolls it under his tongue as a sweet morsel, because of the
secular profit and sensual pleasure which may attend it; yet the meat in
his bowels will be turned, it will be the gall of asps, [Job
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#013.md), [Job
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#014.md). When their consciences are
convinced, and sin appears in its true colours and makes them a terror
to themselves - when the cup of trembling is put into their hands and
they are made to drink the dregs of it - then their iniquity will be
found hateful, and their self-flattery their unspeakable folly, and an
aggravation of their condemnation.

II\. Here are the cursed branches which spring from this root of
bitterness. The sinner defies God, and even deifies himself, and then
what can be expected but that he should go all to naught? These two were
the first inlets of sin. Men do not fear God, and therefore they flatter
themselves, and then, 1. They make no conscience of what they say, true
of false, right or wrong ([Psa 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#003).md):
The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit, contrived to do wrong,
and yet to cover it with specious and plausible pretences. It is no
marvel if those that deceive themselves contrive how to deceive all
mankind; for to whom will those be true who are false to their own
souls? 2. What little good there has been in them is gone; the sparks of
virtue are extinguished, their convictions baffled, their good
beginnings come to nothing: They have left off to be wise and to do
good. They seemed to be under the direction of wisdom and the government
of religion, but they have broken these bonds asunder; they have shaken
off their religion, and therewith their wisdom. Note, Those that leave
off to do good leave off to be wise. 3. Having left off to do good, they
contrive to do hurt and to be vexatious to those about them that are
good and do good ([Psa 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#004).md): He
devises mischief upon his bed. Note, (1.) Omissions make way for
commissions. When men leave off doing good, leave off praying, leave off
their attendance on God's ordinances and their duty to him, the devil
easily makes them his agents, his instruments to draw those that will be
drawn into sin, and, with respect to those that will not, to draw them
into trouble. Those that leave off to do good begin to do evil; the
devil, being an apostate from his innocency, soon became a tempter to
Eve and a persecutor of righteous Abel. (2.) It is bad to do mischief,
but it is worse to devise it, to do it deliberately and with resolution,
to set the wits on work to contrive to do it most effectually, to do it
with plot and management, with the subtlety, as well as the malice, of
the old serpent, to devise it upon the bed, where we should be
meditating upon God and his word, [Mic
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md). This argues the sinner's heart
fully set in him to do evil. 4. Having entered into the way of sin, that
way that is not good, that has good neither in it nor at the end of it,
they persist and resolve to persevere in that way. He sets himself to
execute the mischief he has devised, and nothing shall be withholden
from him which he has purposed to do, though it be ever to contrary both
to his duty and to his true interest. If sinners did not steel their
hearts and brazen their faces with obstinacy and impudence, they could
not go on in their evil ways, in such a direct opposition to all that is
just and good. 5. Doing evil themselves, they have no dislike at all of
it in others: He abhors not evil, but on the contrary, takes pleasure in
it, and is glad to see others as bad as himself. Or this may denote his
impenitency in sin. Those that have done evil, if God give them
repentance, abhor the evil they have done and themselves because of it;
it is bitter in the reflection, however sweet it was in the commission.
But these hardened sinners have such seared stupefied consciences that
they never reflect upon their sings afterwards with any regret or
remorse, but stand to what they have done, as if they could justify it
before God himself.

Some think that David, in all this, particularly means Saul, who had
cast off the fear of God and left off all goodness, who pretended
kindness to him when he gave him his daughter to wife, but at the same
time was devising mischief against him. But we are under no necessity of
limiting ourselves so in the exposition of it; there are too many among
us to whom the description agrees, which is to be greatly lamented.

[Psalms 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 36:5</span></span>

David, having looked round with grief upon the wickedness of the wicked,
here looks up with comfort upon the goodness of God, a subject as
delightful as the former was distasteful and very proper to be set in
the balance against it. Observe,

I. His meditations upon the grace of God. He sees the world polluted,
himself endangered, and God dishonoured, by the transgressions of the
wicked; but, of a sudden, he turns his eye, and heart, and speech, to
God "However it be, yet thou art good." He here acknowledges,

1\. The transcendent perfections of the divine nature. Among men we have
often reason to complain, There is no truth nor mercy, ([Hos
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001).md), no judgment nor justice, [Isa
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#007.md). But all these may be found in God
without the least alloy. Whatever is missing, or amiss, in the world, we
are sure there is nothing missing, nothing amiss, in him that governs
it. (1.) He is a God of inexhaustible goodness: Thy mercy, O Lord! is in
the heavens. If men shut up the bowels of their compassion, yet with
God, at the throne of his grace, we shall find mercy. When men are
devising mischief against us God's thoughts concerning us, if we cleave
closely to him, are thoughts of good. On earth we meet with little
content and a great deal of disquiet and disappointment; but in the
heavens, where the mercy of God reigns in perfection and to eternity,
there is all satisfaction; there therefore, if we would be easy, let us
have our conversation, and there let us long to be. How bad soever the
world is, let us never think the worse of God nor of his government;
but, from the abundance of wickedness that is among men, let us take
occasion, instead of reflecting upon God's purity, as if he countenanced
sin, to admire his patience, that he bears so much with those that so
impudently provoke him, nay, and causes his sun to shine and his rain to
fall upon them. If God's mercy were not in the heavens (that is,
infinitely above the mercies of any creature), he would, long ere this,
have drowned the world again. See [Isa
55:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#008.md), [Isa
55:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#009.md); [Hos
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009). (2..md) He is a God of inviolable
truth: Thy faithfulness reaches unto the clouds. Though God suffers
wicked people to do a great deal of mischief, yet he is and will be
faithful to his threatenings against sin, and there will come a day when
he will reckon with them; he is faithful also to his covenant with his
people, which cannot be broken, nor one jot or tittle of the promises of
it defeated by all the malice of earth and hell. This is matter of great
comfort to all good people, that, though men are false, God is faithful;
men speak vanity, but the words of the Lord are pure words. God's
faithfulness reaches so high that it does not change with the weather,
as men's does, for it reaches to the skies (so it should be read, as
some think), above the clouds, and all the changes of the lower region.
(3.) He is a God of incontestable justice and equity: Thy righteousness
is like the great mountains, so immovable and inflexible itself and so
conspicuous and evident to all the world; for no truth is more certain
nor more plain than this, That the Lord is righteous in all his ways,
and that he never did, nor ever will do, any wrong to any of his
creatures. Even when clouds and darkness are round about him, yet
judgment and justice are the habitation of his throne, [Psa
97:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#002). (4..md) He is a God of unsearchable
wisdom and design: "Thy judgments are a great deep, not to be fathomed
with the line and plummet of any finite understanding." As his power is
sovereign, which he owes not any account of to us, so his method is
singular and mysterious, which cannot be accounted for by us: His way is
in the sea and his path in the great waters. We know that he does all
wisely and well; but what he does we know not now; it will be time
enough to know hereafter.

2\. The extensive care and beneficence of the divine Providence: "Thou
preservest man and beast, not only protectest them from mischief, but
suppliest them with that which is needful for the support of life." The
beasts, though not capable of knowing and praising God, are yet
graciously provided for; their eyes wait on him, and he gives them their
meat in due season. Let us not wonder that God gives food to bad men,
for he feeds the brute-creatures; and let us not fear but that he will
provide well for good men; he that feeds the young lions will not starve
his own children.

3\. The peculiar favour of God to the saints. Observe,

(1.) Their character, [Psa 36:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#007.md). They
are such as are allured by the excellency of God's loving-kindness to
put their trust under the shadow of his wings. \[1.\] God's
loving-kindness is precious to them. They relish it; they taste a
transcendent sweetness in it; they admire God's beauty and benignity
above any thing in this world, nothing so amiable, so desirable. Those
know not God that do not admire his loving-kindness; and those know not
themselves that do not earnestly covet it. \[2.\] They therefore repose
an entire confidence in him. They have recourse to him, put themselves
under his protection, and then think themselves safe and find themselves
easy, as the chickens under the wings of the hen, [Mat
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md). It was the character of
proselytes that they came to trust under the wings of the God of Israel
([Rut 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#012).md); and what more proper to
gather proselytes than the excellency of his loving-kindness? What more
powerful to engage our complacency to him and on him? Those that are
thus drawn by love will cleave to him.

(2.) Their privilege. Happy, thrice happy, the people whose God is the
Lord, for in him they have, or may have, or shall have, a complete
happiness. \[1.\] Their desires shall be answered, ([Psa
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008).md): They shall be abundantly
satisfied with the fatness of thy house, their wants supplied; their
cravings gratified, and their capacities filled. In God all-sufficient
they shall have enough, all that which an enlightened enlarged soul can
desire or receive. The gains of the world and the delights of sense will
surfeit, but never satisfy, [Isa 55:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#002.md).
But the communications of divine favour and grace will satisfy, but
never surfeit. A gracious soul, though still desiring more of God, never
desires more than God. The gifts of Providence so far satisfy them that
they are content with such things as they have. I have all, and abound,
[Phi 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018.md). The benefit of holy
ordinances is the fatness of God's house, sweet to a sanctified soul and
strengthening to the spiritual and divine life. With this they are
abundantly satisfied; they desire nothing more in this world than to
live a life of communion with God and to have the comfort of the
promises. But the full, the abundant satisfaction is reserved for the
future state, the house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
Every vessel will be full there. \[2.\] Their joys shall be constant:
Thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. First, There
are pleasures that are truly divine. "They are thy pleasures, not only
which come from thee as the giver of them, but which terminate in thee
as the matter and centre of them." Being purely spiritual, they are of
the same nature with those of the glorious inhabitants of the upper
world, and bear some analogy even to the delights of the Eternal Mind.
Secondly, There is a river of these pleasures, always full, always
fresh, always flowing. There is enough for all, enough for each; see
[Psa 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#004.md). The pleasures of sense are
putrid puddle-water; those of faith are pure and pleasant, clear as
crystal, [Rev 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001.md). Thirdly, God has
not only provided this river of pleasures for his people, but he makes
them to drink of it, works in them a gracious appetite to these
pleasures, and by his Spirit fills their souls with joy and peace in
believing. In heaven they shall be for ever drinking of those pleasures
that are at God's right hand, satiated with a fulness of joy, [Psa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011.md). \[3.\] Life and light shall be
their everlasting bliss and portion, [Psa
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#009.md). Having God himself for their
felicity, First, In him they have a fountain of life, from which those
rivers of pleasure flow, [Psa 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008.md).
The God of nature is the fountain of natural life. In him we live, and
move, and have our being. The God of grace is the fountain of spiritual
life. All the strength and comfort of a sanctified soul, all its
gracious principles, powers, and performances, are from God. He is the
spring and author of all its sensations of divine things, and all its
motions towards them: he quickens whom he will; and whosoever will may
come, and take from him of the waters of life freely. He is the fountain
of eternal life. The happiness of glorified saints consists in the
vision and fruition of him, and in the immediate communications of his
love, without interruption or fear of cessation. Secondly, In him they
have light in perfection, wisdom, knowledge, and joy, all included in
this light: In thy light we shall see light, that is, 1. "In the
knowledge of thee in grace, and the vision of thee in glory, we shall
have that which will abundantly suit and satisfy our understandings."
That divine light which shines in the scripture, and especially in the
face of Christ, the light of the world, has all truth in it. When we
come to see God face to face, within the veil, we shall see light in
perfection, we shall know enough then, [Co1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012.md); [Jo1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002.md). 2. "In communion with thee now;
by the communications of thy grace to us and the return of our devout
affections to thee, and in the fruition of thee shortly in heaven, we
shall have a complete felicity and satisfaction. In thy favour we have
all the good we can desire." This is a dark world; we see little comfort
in it; but in the heavenly light there is true light, and no false
light, light that is lasting and never wastes. In this world we see God,
and enjoy him by creatures and means; but in heaven God himself shall be
with us ([Rev 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003).md) and we shall see
and enjoy him immediately.

II\. We have here David's prayers, intercessions, and holy triumphs,
grounded upon these meditations.

1\. He intercedes for all saints, begging that they may always
experience the benefit and comfort of God's favour and grace, [Psa
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#010). (1..md) The persons he prays for
are those that know God, that are acquainted with him, acknowledge him,
and avouch him for theirs - the upright in heart, that are sincere in
their profession of religion, and faithful both to God and man. Those
that are not upright with God do not know him as they should. (2.) The
blessing he begs for them is God's loving-kindness (that is, the tokens
of his favour towards them) and his righteousness (that is, the workings
of his grace in them); or his loving-kindness and righteousness are his
goodness according to promise; they are mercy and truth. (3.) The manner
in which he desires this blessing may be conveyed: O continue it, draw
it out, as the mother draws out her breasts to the child, and then the
child draws out the milk from the breasts. Let it be drawn out to a
length equal to the line of eternity itself. The happiness of the saints
in heaven will be in perfection, and yet in continual progression (as
some thing); for the fountain there will be always full and the streams
always flowing. In these is continuance, [Isa
64:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#005.md).

2\. He prays for himself, that he might be preserved in his integrity
and comfort ([Psa 36:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#011).md): "Let not the
foot of pride come against me, to trip up my heels, or trample upon me;
and let not the hand of the wicked, which is stretched out against me,
prevail to remove me, either from my purity and integrity, by any
temptation, or from my peace and comfort, by any trouble." Let not those
who fight against God triumph over those who desire to cleave to him.
Those that have experienced the pleasure of communion with God cannot
but desire that nothing may ever remove them from him.

3\. He rejoices in hope of the downfall of all his enemies in due time
([Psa 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#012).md): "There, where they
thought to gain the point against me, they have themselves fallen, been
taken in that snare which they laid for me." There, in the other world
(so some), where the saints stand in the judgment, and have a place in
God's house, the workers of iniquity are cast in the judgment, are cast
down into hell, into the bottomless pit, out of which they shall
assuredly never be able to rise from under the insupportable weight of
God's wrath and curse. It is true we are not to rejoice when any
particular enemy of ours falls; but the final overthrow of all the
workers of iniquity will be the everlasting triumph of glorified saints.
