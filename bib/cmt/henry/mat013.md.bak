### [Matthew Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#001.md)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 13:0</span></span>

In this chapter, we have, I. The favour which Christ did to his
countrymen in preaching the kingdom of heaven to them ([Mat
13:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#001).md). He preached to them in
parables, and here gives the reason why he chose that way of instructing
([Mat 13:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#010).md). And the evangelist
gives another reason ([Mat 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#034.md), [Mat
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#035).md). There are eight parables
recorded in this chapter, which are designed to represent the kingdom of
heaven, the method of planting the gospel kingdom in the world, and of
its growth and success. The great truths and laws of that kingdom are in
other scriptures laid down plainly, and without parables: but some
circumstances of its beginning and progress are here laid open in
parables. 1. Here is one parable to show what are the great hindrances
of people's profiting by the word of the gospel, and in how many it
comes short of its end, through their own folly, and that is the parable
of the four sorts of ground, delivered ([Mat
13:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#003).md). and expounded ([Mat
13:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#018).md). 2. Here are two parables
intended to show that there would be a mixture of good and bad in the
gospel church, which would continue till the great separation between
them in the judgment day: the parable of the tares put forth ([Mat
13:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#024).md), and expounded at the
request of the disciples ([Mat
13:36-43](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#036).md); and that of the net cast
into the sea ([Mat 13:47-50](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#047).md). 3. Here
are two parables intended to show that the gospel church should be very
small at first, but that in process of time it should become a
considerable body: that of the grain of mustard-seed ([Mat
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#031.md), [Mat
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#032).md), and that of the leaven ([Mat
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#033).md). 4. Here are two parables
intended to show that those who expect salvation by the gospel must be
willing to venture all, and quit all, in the prospect of it, and that
they shall be no losers by the bargain; that of the treasure hid in the
field ([Mat 13:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#044).md), and that of the
pearl of great price ([Mat 13:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#045.md), [Mat
13:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#046).md). 5. Here is one parable
intended for direction to the disciples, to make use of the instructions
he had given them for the benefit of others; and that is the parable of
the good householder ([Mat 13:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#051.md), [Mat
13:52](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#052).md). II. The contempt which his
countrymen put upon him on account of the meanness of his parentage
([Mat 13:53-58](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#053).md).

[Matthew 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 13:1</span></span>

We have here Christ preaching, and may observe,

1\. When Christ preached this sermon; it was the same day that he
preached the sermon in the foregoing chapter: so unwearied was he in
doing good, and working the works of him that sent him. Note, Christ was
for preaching both ends of the day, and has by his example recommended
that practice to his church; we must in the morning sow our seed, and in
the evening not withhold our hand, [Ecc
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#006.md). An afternoon sermon well heard,
will be so far from driving out the morning sermon, that it will rather
clench it, and fasten the nail in a sure place. Though Christ had been
in the morning opposed and cavilled at by his enemies, disturbed and
interrupted by his friends, yet he went on with his work; and in the
latter part of the day, we do not find that he met with such
discouragements. Those who with courage and zeal break through
difficulties in God's service, will perhaps find them not so apt to
recur as they fear. Resist them, and they will flee.

2\. To whom he preached; there were great multitudes gathered together
to him, and they were the auditors; we do not find that any of the
scribes or Pharisees were present. They were willing to hear him when he
preached in the synagogue ([Mat 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#009.md),
[Mat 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#014).md), but they thought it below
them to hear a sermon by the sea-side, though Christ himself was the
preacher: and truly he had better have their room than their company,
for now they were absent, he went on quietly and without contradiction.
Note, Sometimes there is most of the power of religion where there is
least of the pomp of it: the poor receive the gospel. When Christ went
to the sea-side, multitudes were presently gathered together to him.
Where the king is, there is the court; where Christ is, there is the
church, though it be by the sea-side. Note, Those who would get good by
the word, must be willing to follow it in all its removes; when the ark
shifts, shift after it. The Pharisees had been labouring, by base
calumnies and suggestions, to drive the people off from following
Christ, but they still flocked after him as much as ever. Note, Christ
will be glorified in spite of all opposition; he will be followed.

3\. Where he preached this sermon.

(1.) His meeting-place was the sea-side. He went out of the house
(because there was no room for the auditory) into the open air. It was
pity but such a Preacher should have had the most spacious, sumptuous,
and convenient place to preach in, that could be devised, like one of
the Roman theatres; but he was now in his state of humiliation, and in
this, as in other things, he denied himself the honours due to him; as
he had not a house of his own to live in, so he had not a chapel of his
own to preach in. By this he teaches us in the external circumstances of
worship not to covet that which is stately, but to make the best of the
conveniences which God in his providence allots to us. When Christ was
born, he was crowded into the stable, and now to the sea-side, upon the
strand, where all persons might come to him with freedom. He that was
truth itself sought no corners (no adyta), as the pagan mysteries did.
Wisdom crieth without, [Pro 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020.md); [Joh
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#020.md).

(2.) His pulpit was a ship; not like Ezra's pulpit, that was made for
the purpose ([Neh 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#004).md); but converted
to this use for want of a better. No place amiss for such a Preacher,
whose presence dignified and consecrated any place: let not those who
preach Christ be ashamed, though they have mean and inconvenient places
to preach in. Some observe, that the people stood upon dry ground and
firm ground, while the Preacher was upon the water in more hazard.
Ministers are most exposed to trouble. Here was a true rostrum, a ship
pulpit.

4\. What and how he preached. (1.) He spake many things unto them. Many
more it is likely than are here recorded, but all excellent and
necessary things, things that belong to our peace, things pertaining to
the kingdom of heaven: they were not trifles, but things of everlasting
consequence, that Christ spoke of. It concerns us to give a more earnest
heed, when Christ has so many things to say to us, that we miss not any
of them. (2.) What he spake was in parables. A parable sometimes
signifies any wise, weighty saying that is instructive; but here in the
gospels it generally signifies a continued similitude or comparison, by
which spiritual or heavenly things were described in language borrowed
from the things of this life. It was a way of teaching used very much,
not only by the Jewish rabbin, but by the Arabians, and the other wise
men of the east; and it was found very profitable, and the more so from
its being pleasant. Our Saviour used it much, and in it condescended to
the capacities of people, and lisped to them in their own language. God
had long used similitudes by his servants the prophets ([Hos
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#010).md), and to little purpose; now he
uses similitudes by his Son; surely they will reverence him who speaks
from heaven, and of heavenly things, and yet clothes them with
expressions borrowed from things earthly. See [Joh
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#012.md). So descending in a cloud. Now,

I. We have here the general reason why Christ taught in parables. The
disciples were a little surprised at it, for hitherto, in his preaching,
he had not much used them, and therefore they ask, Why speakest thou to
them in parables? Because they were truly desirous that the people might
hear with understanding. They do not say, Why speakest thou to us? (they
knew how to get the parables explained) but to them. Note, We ought to
be concerned for the edification of others, as well as for our own, by
the word preached; and if ourselves be strong, yet to bear the
infirmities of the weak.

To this question Christ answers largely, [Mat
13:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011.md), where he tells them, that
therefore he preached by parables, because thereby the things of God
were made more plain and easy to them who were willingly ignorant; and
thus the gospel would be a savour of life to some, and of death to
others. A parable, like the pillar of cloud and fire, turns a dark side
towards Egyptians, which confounds them, but a light side towards
Israelites, which comforts them, and so answers a double intention. The
same light directs the eyes of some, but dazzles the eyes of others.
Now,

1\. This reason is laid down ([Mat
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011).md): Because it is given unto you
to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not
given. That is, (1.) The disciples had knowledge, but the people had
not. You know already something of these mysteries, and need not in this
familiar way to be instructed; but the people are ignorant, are yet but
babes, and must be taught as such by plain similitudes, being yet
incapable of receiving instruction in any other way: for though they
have eyes, they know not how to use them; so some. Or, (2.) The
disciples were well inclined to the knowledge of gospel mysteries, and
would search into the parables, and by them would be led into a more
intimate acquaintance with those mysteries; but the carnal hearers that
rested in bare hearing, and would not be at the pains to look further,
nor to ask the meaning of the parables, would be never the wiser, and so
would justly suffer for their remissions. A parable is a shell that
keeps good fruit for the diligent, but keeps it from the slothful. Note,
There are mysteries in the kingdom of heaven, and without controversy,
great is the mystery of godliness: Christ's incarnation, satisfaction,
intercession, our justification and sanctification by union with Christ,
and indeed the whole work of redemption, from first to last, are
mysteries, which could never have been discovered but by divine
revelation ([Co1 15:51](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#051).md), were at this
time discovered but in part to the disciples, and will never be fully
discovered till the veil shall be rent; but the mysteriousness of gospel
truth should not discourage us fRom. but quicken us in, our enquiries
after it and searches into it. \[1.\] It is graciously given to the
disciples of Christ to be acquainted with these mysteries. Knowledge is
the first gift of God, and it is a distinguishing gift ([Pro
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#006).md); it was given to the apostles,
because they were Christ's constant followers and attendants. Note, The
nearer we draw to Christ, and the more we converse with him, the better
acquainted we shall be with gospel mysteries. \[2.\] It is given to all
true believers, who have an experimental knowledge of the gospel
mysteries, and that is without doubt the best knowledge: a principle of
grace in the heart, is that which makes men of quick understanding in
the fear of the Lord, and in the faith of Christ, and so in the meaning
of parables; and for want of that, Nicodemus, a master in Israel, talked
of the new birth as a blind man of colours. \[3.\] There are those to
whom this knowledge is not given, and a man can receive nothing unless
it be given him from above ([Joh
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#027).md); and be it remembered that God
is debtor to no man; his grace is his own; he gives or withholds it at
pleasure ([Rom 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#035).md); the difference
must be resolved into God's sovereignty, as before, [Mat
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025.md), [Mat
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#026.md).

2\. This reason is further illustrated by the rule God observes in
dispensing his gifts; he bestows them on those who improve them, but
takes them away from those who bury them. It is a rule among men, that
they will rather entrust their money with those who have increased their
estates by their industry, than with those who have diminished them by
their slothfulness.

(1.) Here is a promise to him that has, that has true grace, pursuant to
the election of grace, that has, and uses what he has; he shall have
more abundance: God's favours are earnests of further favours; where he
lays the foundation, he will build upon it. Christ's disciples used the
knowledge they now had, and they had more abundance at the pouring out
of the Spirit, Acts 2. They who have the truth of grace, shall have the
increase of grace, even to an abundance in glory, [Pro
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018.md). Joseph - He will add, [Gen
30:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#024.md).

(2.) Here is a threatening to him that has not, that has no desire of
grace, that makes no right use of the gifts and graces he has: has not
root, no solid principle; that has, but uses not what he has; from him
shall be taken away that which he has or seems to have. His leaves shall
wither, his gifts decay; the means of grace he has, and makes no use of,
shall be taken from him; God will call in his talents out of their hands
that are likely to become bankrupts quickly.

3\. This reason is particularly explained, with reference to the two
sorts of people Christ had to do with.

(1.) Some were willingly ignorant; and such were amused by the parables
([Mat 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#013).md); because they seeing, see
not. They had shut their eyes against the clear light of Christ's
plainer preaching, and therefore were now left in the dark. Seeing
Christ's person, they see not his glory, see no difference between him
and another man; seeing his miracles, and hearing his preaching, they
see not, they hear not with any concern or application; they understand
neither. Note, \[1.\] There are many that see the gospel light, and hear
the gospel sound, but it never reaches their hearts, nor has it any
place in them. \[2.\] It is just with God to take away the light from
those who shut their eyes against it; that such as will be ignorant, may
be so; and God's dealing thus with them magnifies his distinguishing
grace to his disciples.

Now in this the scripture would be fulfilled, [Mat
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#014.md), [Mat
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#015.md). It is quoted from [Isa
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009.md), [Isa
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010.md). The evangelical prophet that
spoke most plainly of gospel grace, foretold the contempt of it, and the
consequences of that contempt. It is referred to no less than six times
in the New Testament, which intimates, that in gospel times spiritual
judgments would be most common, which make least noise, but are most
dreadful. That which was spoken of the sinners in Isaiah's time was
fulfilled in those in Christ's time, and it is still fulfilling every
day; for while the wicked heart of man keeps up the same sin, the
righteous hand of God inflicts the same punishment. Here is,

First. A description of sinners' wilful blindness and hardness, which is
their sin. This people's heart is waxed gross; it is fattened, so the
word is; which denotes both sensuality and senselessness ([Psa
119:70](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#070).md); secure under the word and rod
of God, and scornful as Jeshurun, that waxed fat and kicked, [Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015.md). And when the heart is thus
heavy, no wonder that the ears are dull of hearing; the whispers of the
Spirit they hear not at all; the loud calls of the word, though the word
be nigh them, they regard not, nor are at all affected by them: they
stop their ears, [Psa 58:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#004.md), [Psa
58:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#005.md). And because they are resolved to
be ignorant, they shut both the learning senses; for their eyes also
they have closed, resolved that they would not see light come into the
world, when the Son of Righteousness arose, but they shut their windows,
because they loved darkness rather than light, [Joh
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019.md); [Pe2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#005.md).

Secondly, A description of that judicial blindness, which is the just
punishment of this. "By hearing, ye shall hear, and shall not
understand; what means of grace you have, shall be to no purpose to you;
though, in mercy to others, they are continued, yet in judgment to you,
the blessing upon them is denied." The saddest condition a man can be in
on this side hell, is to sit under the most lively ordinances with a
dead, stupid, untouched heart. To hear God's word, and see his
providences, and yet not to understand and perceive his will, either in
the one or in the other, is the greatest sin and the greatest judgment
that can be. Observe, It is God's work to give an understanding heart,
and he often, in a way of righteous judgment, denies it to those to whom
he has given the hearing ear, and the seeing eye, in vain. Thus does God
choose sinners' delusions ([Isa
66:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#004).md),. and bind them over to the
greatest ruin, by giving them up to their own hearts' lusts ([Psa
81:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#011.md), [Psa
81:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#012).md); let them alone ([Hos
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#017).md); my Spirit shall not always
strive, [Gen 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003.md).

Thirdly, The woeful effect and consequence of this; Lest at any time
they should see. They will not see because they will not turn; and God
says that they shall not see, because they shall not turn: lest they
should be converted, and I should heal them.

Note, 1. That seeing, hearing, and understanding, are necessary to
conversion; for God, in working grace, deals with men as men, as
rational agents; he draws with the cords of a man, changes the heart by
opening the eyes, and turns from the power of Satan unto God, by turning
first from darkness to light, ([Act
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#018).md). 2. All those who are truly
converted to God, shall certainly be healed by him. "If they be
converted I shall heal them, I shall save them:" so that if sinners
perish, it is not to be imputed to God, but to themselves; they
foolishly expected to be healed, without being converted. 3. It is just
with God to deny his grace to those who have long and often refused the
proposals of it, and resisted the power of it. Pharaoh, for a good
while, hardened his own heart ([Exo
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#015.md), [Exo
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#032).md), and afterwards God hardened it,
[Mat 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#012.md); [Mat
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#020.md). Let us therefore fear, lest by
sinning against the divine grace, we sin it away.

(2.) Others were effectually called to be the disciples of Christ, and
were truly desirous to be taught of him; and they were instructed, and
made to improve greatly in knowledge, by these parables, especially when
they were expounded; and by them the things of God were made more plain
and easy, more intelligible and familiar, and more apt to be remembered
([Mat 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#016.md), [Mat
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#017).md). Your eyes see, your ears hear.
They saw the glory of God in Christ's person; they heard the mind of God
in Christ's doctrine; they saw much, and were desirous to see more, and
thereby were prepared to receive further instruction; they had
opportunity for it, by being constant attendants on Christ, and they
should have it from day to day, and grace with it. Now this Christ
speaks of,

\[1.\] As a blessing; "Blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears
for they hear; it is your happiness, and it is a happiness for which you
are indebted to the peculiar favour and blessing of God." It is a
promised blessing, that in the days of the Messiah the eyes of them that
see shall not be dim, [Isa 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#003.md). The
eyes of the meanest believer that knows experimentally the grace of
Christ, are more blessed than those of the greatest scholars, the
greatest masters in experimental philosophy, that are strangers to God;
who, like the other gods they serve, have eyes, and see not. Blessed are
your eyes. Note, True blessedness is entailed upon the right
understanding and due improvement of the mysteries of the kingdom of
God. The hearing ear and the seeing eye are God's work in those who are
sanctified; they are the work of his grace ([Pro
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#012).md), and they are a blessed work,
which shall be fulfilled with power, when those who now see through a
glass darkly, shall see face to face. It was to illustrate this
blessedness that Christ said so much of the misery of those who are left
in ignorance; they have eyes and see not; but blessed are your eyes.
Note, The knowledge of Christ is a distinguishing favour to those who
have it, and upon that account it lays under the greater obligations;
see [Joh 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#022.md). The apostles were to
teach others, and therefore were themselves blessed with the clearest
discoveries of divine truth. The watchmen shall see eye to eye, [Isa
52:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#008.md).

\[2.\] As a transcendent blessing, desired by, but not granted to, many
prophets and righteous men, [Mat
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#017.md). The Old Testament saints, who
had some glimpses, some glimmerings of gospel light, coveted earnestly
further discoveries. They had the types, shadows, and prophecies, of
those things but longed to see the Substance, that glorious end of those
things which they could not steadfastly look unto; that glorious inside
of those things which they could not look into. They desired to see the
great Salvation, the Consolation of Israel, but did not see it, because
the fulness of time was not yet come. Note, First, Those who know
something of Christ, cannot but covet to know more. Secondly, The
discoveries of divine grace are made, even to prophets and righteous
men, but according to the dispensation they are under. Though they were
the favourites of heaven, with whom God's secret was, yet they have not
seen the things which they desired to see, because God had determined
not to bring them to light yet; and his favours shall not anticipate his
counsels. There was then, as there is still, a glory to be revealed;
something in reserve, that they without us should not be made perfect,
[Heb 11:40](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#040.md). Thirdly, For the exciting
of our thankfulness, and the quickening of our diligence, it is good for
us to consider what means we enjoy, and what discoveries are made to us,
now under the gospel, above what they had, and enjoyed, who lived under
the Old Testament dispensation, especially in the revelation of the
atonement for sin; see what are the advantages of the New Testament
above the Old ([Co2 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007.md), etc. [Heb
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#018).md); and see that our improvements
be proportionable to our advantages.

II\. We have, in these verses, one of the parables which our Saviour put
forth; it is that of the sower and the seed; both the parable itself,
and the explanation of it. Christ's parables are borrowed from common,
ordinary things, not from any philosophical notions or speculations, or
the unusual phenomena of nature, though applicable enough to the matter
in hand, but from the most obvious things, that are of every day's
observation, and come within the reach of the meanest capacity; many of
them are fetched from the husbandman's calling, as this of the sower,
and that of the tares. Christ chose to do thus, 1. That spiritual things
might hereby be made more plain, and, by familiar similitudes, might be
made the more easy to slide into our understandings. 2. That common
actions might hereby be spiritualized, and we might take occasion from
those things which fall so often under our view, to meditate with
delight on the things of God; and thus, when our hands are busiest about
the world, we may not only notwithstanding that, but even with the help
of that, be led to have our hearts in heaven. Thus the word of God shall
talk with us, talk familiarly with us, [Pro
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#022.md).

The parable of the sower is plain enough, [Mat
13:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#003.md). The exposition of it we have
from Christ himself, who knew best what was his own meaning. The
disciples, when they asked, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?
([Mat 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#010).md), intimated a desire to
have the parable explained for the sake of the people; nor was it any
disparagement to their own knowledge to desire it for themselves. Our
Lord Jesus kindly took the hint, and gave the sense, and caused them to
understand the parable, directing his discourse to the disciples, but in
the hearing of the multitude, for we have not the account of his
dismissing them till [Mat 13:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#036.md). "Hear
ye therefore the parable of the sower ([Mat
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#018).md); you have heard it, but let us
go over it again." Note, It is of good use, and would contribute much to
our understanding the word and profiting by it, to hear over again what
we have heard ([Phi 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#001).md); "You have
heard it, but hear the interpretation of it." Note, Then only we hear
the word aright, and to good purpose, when we understand what we hear;
it is no hearing at all, if it be not with understanding, [Neh
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#002.md). It is God's grace indeed that
gives the understanding, but it is our duty to give our minds to
understand.

Let us therefore compare the parable and the exposition.

(1.) The seed sown is the word of God, here called the word of the
kingdom ([Mat 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#019).md): the kingdom of
heaven, that is the kingdom; the kingdoms of the world, compared with
that, are not to be called kingdoms. The gospel comes from that kingdom,
and conducts to that kingdom; the word of the gospel is the word of the
kingdom; it is the word of the King, and where that is, there is power;
it is a law, by which we must be ruled and governed. This word is the
seed sown, which seems a dead, dry thing, but all the product is
virtually in it. It is incorruptible seed ([Pe1
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023).md); it is the gospel that brings
forth fruit in souls, [Col 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005.md), [Col
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006.md).

(2.) The sower that scatters the seed is our Lord Jesus Christ, either
by himself, or by his ministers; see [Mat
13:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#037.md). The people are God's husbandry,
his tillage, so the word is; and ministers are labourers together with
God, [Co1 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#009.md). Preaching to a
multitude is sowing the corn; we know not where it must light; only see
that it be good, that it be clean, and be sure to give it seed enough.
The sowing of the word is the sowing of a people for God's field, the
corn of his floor, [Isa 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#010.md).

(3.) The ground in which this seed is sown is the hearts of the children
of men, which are differently qualified and disposed, and accordingly
the success of the word is different. Note, Man's heart is like soil,
capable of improvement, of bearing good fruit; it is pity it should lie
fallow, or be like the field of the slothful, [Pro
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#030.md). The soul is the proper place
for the word of God to dwell, and work, and rule in; its operation is
upon conscience, it is to light that candle of the Lord. Now according
as we are, so the word is to us: Recipitur ad modum recipientis - The
reception depends upon the receiver. As it is with the earth; some sort
of ground, take ever so much pains with it, and throw ever so good seed
into it, yet it brings forth no fruit to any purpose; while the good
soil brings forth plentifully: so it is with the hearts of men, whose
different characters are here represented by four sorts of ground, of
which three are bad, and but one good. Note, The number of fruitless
hearers is very great, even of those who heard Christ himself. Who has
believed our report? It is a melancholy prospect which this parable
gives us of the congregations of those who hear the gospel preached,
that scarcely one in four brings forth fruit to perfection. Many are
called with the common call, but in few is the eternal choice evidenced
by the efficacy of that call, [Mat
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#016.md).

Now observe the characters of these four sorts of ground.

\[1.\] The highway ground, [Mat
13:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#004.md). They had pathways through
their corn-fields ([Mat 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001).md), and the
seed that fell on them never entered, and so the birds picked it up. The
place where Christ's hearers now stood represented the characters of
most of them, the sand on the sea-shore, which was to the seed like the
highway ground.

Observe First, What kind of hearers are compared to the highway ground;
such as hear the word and understand it not; and it is their own fault
that they do not. They take no heed to it, take no hold of it; they do
not come with any design to get good, as the highway was never intended
to be sown. They come before God as his people come, and sit before his
as his people sit; but it is merely for fashion-sake, to see and be
seen; they mind not what is said, it comes in at one ear and goes out at
the other, and makes no impression.

Secondly, How they come to be unprofitable hearers. The wicked one, that
is, the devil, cometh and catcheth away that which was sown. - Such
mindless, careless, trifling hearers are an easy prey to Satan; who, as
he is the great murderer of souls, so he is the great thief of sermons,
and will be sure to rob us of the word, if we take not care to keep it:
as the birds pick up the seed that falls on the ground that is neither
ploughed before nor harrowed after. If we break not up the fallow
ground, by preparing our hearts for the word, and humbling them to it,
and engaging our own attention; and if we cover not the seed afterwards,
by meditation and prayer; if we give not a more earnest heed to the
things which we have heard, we are as the highway ground. Note, The
devil is a sworn enemy to our profiting by the word of God; and none do
more befriend his design than heedless hearers, who are thinking of
something else, when they should be thinking of the things that belong
to their peace.

\[2.\] The stony ground. Some fell upon stony places ([Mat
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#005.md), [Mat
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#006).md), which represents the case of
hearers that go further than the former, who receive some good
impressions of the word, but they are not lasting, [Mat
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#020.md), [Mat
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#021.md). Note, It is possible we may be
a great deal better than some others, and yet not be so good as we
should be; may go beyond our neighbours, and yet come short of heaven.
Now observe, concerning these hearers that are represented by the stony
ground,

First, How far they went. 1. They hear the word; they turn neither their
backs upon it, nor a deaf ear to it. Note, hearing the word, though ever
so frequently, ever so gravely, if we rest in that, will never bring us
to heaven. 2. They are quick in hearing, swift to hear, he anon
receiveth it, euthus, he is ready to receive it, forthwith it sprung up
([Mat 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#005).md), it sooner appeared above
ground than that which was sown in the good soil. Note, Hypocrites often
get the start of true Christians in the shows of profession, and are
often too hot to hold. He receiveth it straightway, without trying it;
swallows it without chewing, and then there can never be a good
digestion. Those are most likely to hold fast that which is good, that
prove all things, [Th1 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#021.md). 3. They
receive it with joy. Note, There are many that are very glad to hear a
good sermon, that yet do not profit by it; they may be pleased with the
word, and yet not changed and ruled by it; the heart may melt under the
word, and yet not be melted down by the word, much less into it, as into
a mould. Many taste the good word of God ([Heb
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#005).md), and say they find sweetness in
it, but some beloved lust is rolled under the tongue, which it would not
agree with, and so they spit it out again. 4. They endure for awhile,
like a violent motion, which continues as long as the impression of the
force remains, but ceases when that has spent itself. Note, Many endure
for awhile, that do not endure to the end, and so come short of the
happiness which is promised to them only that persevere ([Mat
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#022).md); they did run well, but
something hindered them, [Gal 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#007.md).

Secondly, How they fell away, so that no fruit was brought to
perfection; no more than the corn, that having no depth of earth from
which to draw moisture, is scorched and withered by the heat of the sun.
And the reason is,

1\. They have no root in themselves, no settled, fixed principles in
their judgments, no firm resolution in their wills, nor any rooted
habits in their affections: nothing firm that will be either the sap or
the strength of their profession. Note, (1.) It is possible there may be
the green blade of a profession, where yet there is not the root of
grace; hardness prevails in the heart, and what there is of soil and
softness is only in the surface; inwardly they are no more affected than
a stone; they have no root, they are not by faith united to Christ who
is our Root; they derive not from him, they depend not on him. (2.)
Where there is not a principle, though there be a profession, we cannot
expect perseverance. Those who have no root will endure but awhile. A
ship without ballast, though she may at first out-sail the laden vessel,
yet will certainly fail in stress of weather, and never make her port.

2\. Times of trial come, and then they come to nothing. When tribulation
and persecution arise because of the word, he is offended; it is a
stumbling-block in his way which he cannot get over, and so he flies
off, and this is all his profession comes to. Note, (1.) After a fair
gale of opportunity usually follows a storm of persecution, to try who
have received the word in sincerity, and who have not. When the word of
Christ's kingdom comes to be the word of Christ's patience ([Rev
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#010).md), then is the trial, who keeps
it, and who does not, [Rev 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#009.md). It is
wisdom to prepare for such a day. (2.) When trying times come, those who
have no root are soon offended; they first quarrel with their
profession, and then quit it; first find fault with it, and then throw
it off. Hence we read of the offence of the cross, [Gal
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#011.md). Observe, Persecution is
represented in the parable by the scorching sun, ([Mat
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#006).md); the same sun which warms and
cherishes that which was well rooted, withers and burns up that which
wanted root. As the word of Christ, so the cross of Christ, is to some a
savour of life unto life, to others a savour of death unto death: the
same tribulation which drives some to apostasy and ruin, works for
others a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Trials which
shake some, confirm others, [Phi 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#012.md).
Observe how soon they fall away, by and by; as soon rotten as they were
ripe; a profession taken up without consideration is commonly let fall
without it: "Lightly come, lightly go."

\[3.\] The thorny ground, Some fell among thorns (which are a good guard
to the corn when they are in the hedge, but a bad inmate when they are
in the field); and the thorns sprung up, which intimates that they did
not appear, or but little, when the corn was sown, but afterwards they
proved choking to it, [Mat 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#007.md). This
went further than the former, for it had root; and it represents the
condition of those who do not quite cast off their profession, and yet
come short of any saving benefit by it; the good they gain by the word,
being insensibly overcome and overborne by the things of the world.
Prosperity destroys the word in the heart, as much as persecution does;
and more dangerously, because more silently: the stones spoiled the
root, the thorns spoil the fruit.

Now what are these choking thorns?

First, The cares of this world. Care for another world would quicken the
springing of this seed, but care for this world chokes it. Worldly cares
are fitly compared to thorns, for they came in with sin, and are a fruit
of the curse; they are good in their place to stop a gap, but a man must
be well armed that deals much in them ([Sa2
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#006.md), [Sa2
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#007).md); they are entangling, vexing,
scratching, and their end is to be burned, [Heb
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#008.md). These thorns choke the good seed.
Note, Worldly cares are great hindrances to our profiting by the word of
God, and our proficiency in religion. They eat up that vigour of soul
which should be spent in divine things; divert us from duty, distract us
in duty, and do us most mischief of all afterwards; quenching the sparks
of good affections, and bursting the cords of good resolutions; those
who are careful and cumbered about many things, commonly neglect the one
thing needful.

Secondly, The deceitfulness of riches. Those who, by their care and
industry, have raised estates, and so the danger that arises from care
seems to be over, and they continue hearers of the word, yet are still
in a snare ([Jer 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#004.md), [Jer
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#005).md); it is hard for them to enter
into the kingdom of heaven: they are apt to promise themselves that in
riches which is not in them; to rely upon them, and to take an
inordinate complacency in them; and this chokes the word as much as care
did. Observe, It is not so much riches, as the deceitfulness of riches,
that does the mischief: now they cannot be said to be deceitful to us
unless we put our confidence in them, and raise our expectations from
them, and then it is that they choke the good seed.

\[4.\] The good ground ([Mat 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#018).md);
Others fell into good ground, and it is pity but that good seed should
always meet with good soil, and then there is no loss; such are good
hearers of the word, [Mat 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#023.md). Note,
Though there are many that receive the grace of God, and the word of his
grace, in vain, yet God has a remnant by whom it is received to good
purpose; for God's word shall not return empty, [Isa
55:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#010.md), [Isa
55:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#011.md).

Now that which distinguished this good ground from the rest, was, in one
word, fruitfulness. By this true Christians are distinguished from
hypocrites, that they bring forth the fruits of righteousness; so shall
ye be my disciples, [Joh 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#008.md). He does
not say that this good ground has no stones in it, or no thorns; but
there were none that prevailed to hinder its fruitfulness. Saints, in
this world, are not perfectly free from the remains of sin; but happily
freed from the reign of it.

The hearers represented by the good ground are,

First, Intelligent hearers; they hear the word and understand it; they
understand not only the sense and meaning of the word, but their own
concern in it; they understand it as a man of business understands his
business. God in his word deals with men as men, in a rational way, and
gains possession of the will and affections by opening the
understanding: whereas Satan, who is a thief and a robber, comes not in
by that door, but climbeth up another way.

Secondly, Fruitful hearers, which is an evidence of their good
understanding: which also beareth fruit. Fruit is to every seed its own
body, a substantial product in the heart and life, agreeable to the seed
of the word received. We then bear fruit, when we practise according to
the word; when the temper of our minds and the tenour of our lives are
conformable to the gospel we have received, and we do as we are taught.

Thirdly, Not all alike fruitful; some a hundred-fold, some sixty, some
thirty. Note, Among fruitful Christians, some are more fruitful than
others: where there is true grace, yet there are degrees of it; some are
of greater attainments in knowledge and holiness than others; all
Christ's scholars are not in the same form. We should aim at the highest
degree, to bring forth a hundred-fold, as Isaac's ground did ([Gen
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#012).md), abounding in the work of the
Lord, [Joh 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#008.md). But if the ground be
good, and the fruit right, the heart honest, and the life of a piece
with it, those who bring forth but thirty-fold shall be graciously
accepted of God, and it will be fruit abounding to their account, for we
are under grace, and not under the law.

[Matthew 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 13:24</span></span>

In these verses, we have, I. Another reason given why Christ preached by
parables, [Mat 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#034.md), [Mat
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#035.md). All these things he spoke in
parables, because the time was not yet come for the more clear and plain
discoveries of the mysteries of the kingdom. Christ, to keep the people
attending and expecting, preached in parables, and without a parable
spake he not unto them; namely, at this time and in this sermon. Note,
Christ tries all ways and methods to do good to the souls of men, and to
make impressions upon them; if men will not be instructed and influenced
by plain preaching, he will try them with parables; and the reason here
given is, That the scripture might be fulfilled. The passage here quoted
for it, is part of the preface to that historical [Psa
78:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#002.md), I will open my mouth in a
parable. What the Psalmist David, or Asaph, says there of his narrative,
is accommodated to Christ's sermons; and that great precedent would
serve to vindicate this way of preaching from the offence which some
took at it. Here is, 1. The matter of Christ's preaching; he preached
things which had been kept secret from the foundation of the world. The
mystery of the gospel had been hid in God, in his councils and decrees,
from the beginning of the world. [Eph
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009.md). Compare [Rom
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025.md); [Co1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007.md); [Col
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026.md). If we delight in the records of
ancient things, and in the revelation of secret things, how welcome
should the gospel be to us, which has in it such antiquity and such
mystery! It was from the foundation of the world wrapt up in types and
shadows, which are now done away; and those secret things are now become
such things revealed as belong to us and to our children, [Deu
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#029.md). 2. The manner of Christ's
preaching; he preached by parables; wise sayings, but figurative, and
which help to engage attention and a diligent search. Solomon's
sententious dictates, which are full of similitudes, are called
proverbs, or parables; it is the same word; but in this, as in other
things, Behold a greater than Solomon is here, in whom are hid treasures
of wisdom.

II\. The parable of the tares, and the exposition of it; they must be
taken together, for the exposition explains the parable and the parable
illustrates the exposition.

Observe, 1. The disciples' request to their Master to have this parable
expounded to them ([Mat 13:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#036).md); Jesus
sent the multitude away; and it is to be feared many of them went away
no wiser than they came; they had heard a sound of words, and that was
all. It is sad to think how many go away from sermons without the word
of grace in their hearts. Christ went into the house, not so much for
his own repose, as for particular converse with his disciples, whose
instruction he chiefly intended in all his preaching. He was ready to do
good in all places; the disciples laid hold on the opportunity, and they
came to him. Note, Those who would be wise for every thing else, must be
wise to discern and improve their opportunities, especially of converse
with Christ, of converse with him alone, in secret meditation and
prayer. It is very good, when we return from the solemn assembly, to
talk over what we have heard there, and by familiar discourse to help
one another to understand and remember it, and to be affected with it;
for we lose the benefit of many a sermon by vain and unprofitable
discourse after it. See [Luk 24:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#032.md);
[Deu 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#006.md), [Deu
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#007.md). It is especially good, if it may
be, to ask of the ministers of the word the meaning of the word, for
their lips should keep knowledge, [Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007.md). Private conference would
contribute much to our profiting by public preaching. Nathan's Thou art
the man, was that which touched David to the heart.

The disciples' request to their Master was, Declare unto us the parable
of the tares. This implied an acknowledgement of their ignorance, which
they were not ashamed to make. It is probable they apprehended the
general scope of the parable, but they desired to understand it more
particularly, and to be assured that they took it right. Note, Those are
rightly disposed for Christ's teaching, that are sensible of their
ignorance, and sincerely desirous to be taught. He will teach the humble
([Psa 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#008.md), [Psa
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#009).md), but will for this be enquired
of. If any man lack instruction, let him ask it of God. Christ had
expounded the foregoing parable unasked, but for the exposition of this
they ask him. Note, The mercies we have received must be improved, both
for direction what to pray for, and for our encouragement in prayer. The
first light and the first grace are given in a preventing way, further
degrees of both which must be daily prayed for.

2\. The exposition Christ gave of the parable, in answer to their
request; so ready is Christ to answer such desires of his disciples. Now
the drift of the parable is, to represent to us the present and future
state of the kingdom of heaven, the gospel church: Christ's care of it,
the devil's enmity against it, the mixture that there is in it of good
and bad in the other world. Note, The visible church is the kingdom of
heaven; though there be many hypocrites in it, Christ rules in it as a
King; and there is a remnant in it, that are the subjects and heirs of
heaven, from whom, as the better part, it is denominated: the church is
the kingdom of heaven upon earth.

Let us go over the particulars of the exposition of the parable.

(1.) He that sows the good seed is the Son of man. Jesus Christ is the
Lord of the field, the Lord of the harvest, the Sower of good seed. When
he ascended on high, he gave gifts to the world; not only good
ministers, but other good men. Note, Whatever good seed there is in the
world, it all comes from the hand of Christ, and is of his sowing:
truths preached, graces planted, souls sanctified, are good seed, and
all owing to Christ. Ministers are instruments in Christ's hand to sow
good seed; are employed by him and under him, and the success of their
labours depends purely upon his blessing; so that it may well be said,
It is Christ, and no other, that sows the good seed; he is the Son of
man, one of us, that his terror might not make us afraid; the Son of
man, the Mediator, and that has authority.

(2.) The field is the world; the world of mankind, a large field,
capable of bringing forth good fruit; the more is it to be lamented that
it brings forth so much bad fruit: the world here is the visible church,
scattered all the world over, not confined to one nation. Observe, In
the parable it is called his field; the world is Christ's field, for all
things are delivered unto him of the Father: whatever power and interest
the devil has in the world, it is usurped and unjust; when Christ comes
to take possession, he comes whose right it is; it is his field, and
because it is his he took care to sow it with good seed.

(3.) The good seed are the children of the kingdom, true saints. They
are, \[1.\] The children of the kingdom; not in profession only, as the
Jews were ([Mat 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#012).md), but in
sincerity; Jews inwardly, Israelites indeed, incorporated in faith and
obedience to Jesus Christ the great King of the church. \[2.\] They are
the good seed, precious as seed, [Psa
126:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#006.md). The seed is the substance of
the field; so the holy seed, [Isa
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#013.md). The seed is scattered, so are
the saints; dispersed, here one and there another, though in some places
thicker sown than in others. The seed is that from which fruit is
expected; what fruit of honour and service God has from this world he
has from the saints, whom he has sown unto himself in the earth, [Hos
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023.md).

(4.) The tares are the children of the wicked one. Here is the character
of sinners, hypocrites, and all profane and wicked people. \[1.\] They
are the children of the devil, as a wicked one. Though they do not own
his name, yet they bear his image, do his lusts, and from him they have
their education; he rules over them, he works in them, [Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002.md); [Joh
8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044.md). \[2.\] They are tares in the
field of this world; they do no good, they do hurt; unprofitable in
themselves, and hurtful to the good seed, both by temptation and
persecution: they are weeds in the garden, have the same rain, and
sunshine, and soil, with the good plants, but are good for nothing: the
tares are among the wheat. Note, God has so ordered it, that good and
bad should be mixed together in this world, that the good may be
exercised, the bad left inexcusable, and a difference made between earth
and heaven.

(5.) The enemy that sowed the tares is the devil; a sworn enemy to
Christ and all that is good, to the glory of the good God, and the
comfort and happiness of all good men. He is an enemy to the field of
the world, which he endeavours to make his own, by sowing his tares in
it. Ever since he became a wicked spirit himself, he has been
industrious to promote wickedness, and has made it his business, aiming
therein to counterwork Christ.

Now concerning the sowing of the tares, observe in the parable,

\[1.\] That they were sown while men slept. Magistrates slept, who by
their power, ministers slept, who by their preaching, should have
prevented this mischief. Note, Satan watches all opportunities, and lays
hold of all advantages, to propagate vice and profaneness. The prejudice
he does to particular persons is when reason and conscience sleep, when
they are off their guard; we have therefore need to be sober, and
vigilant. It was in the night, for that is the sleeping time. Note,
Satan rules in the darkness of this world; that gives him an opportunity
to sow tares, [Psa 104:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#020.md). It was
while men slept; and there is no remedy but men must have some sleeping
time. Note, It is as impossible for us to prevent hypocrites being in
the church, as it is for the husbandman, when he is asleep, to hinder an
enemy from spoiling his field.

\[2.\] The enemy, when he had sown the tares, went his way ([Mat
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#025).md), that it might not be known who
did it. Note, When Satan is doing the greatest mischief, he studies most
to conceal himself; for his design is in danger of being spoiled if he
be seen in it; and therefore, when he comes to sow tares, he transforms
himself into an angel of light, [Co2
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#013.md), [Co2
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#014.md). He went his way, as if he had
done no harm; such is the way of the adulterous woman, [Pro
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#020.md). Observe, Such is the proneness
of fallen man to sin, that if the enemy sow the tares, he may even go
his way, they will spring up of themselves and do hurt; whereas, when
good seed is sown, it must be tended, watered, and fenced, or it will
come to nothing.

\[3.\] The tares appeared not till the blade sprung up, and brought
forth fruit, [Mat 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#026.md). There is a
great deal of secret wickedness in the hearts of men, which is long hid
under the cloak of a plausible profession, but breaks out at last. As
the good seed, so the tares, lie a great while under the clods, and at
first springing up, it is hard to distinguish them; but when a trying
time comes, when fruit is to be brought forth, when good is to be done
that has difficulty and hazard attending it, then you will return and
discern between the sincere and the hypocrite: then you may say, This is
wheat, and that is tares.

\[4.\] The servants, when they were aware of it, complained to their
master ([Mat 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#027).md); Sir, didst thou
not sow good seed in thy field? No doubt he did; whatever is amiss in
the church, we are sure it is not of Christ: considering the seed which
Christ sows, we may well ask, with wonder, Whence should these tares
come? Note, The rise of errors, the breaking out of scandals, and the
growth of profaneness, are matter of great grief to all the servants of
Christ; especially to his faithful ministers, who are directed to
complain of it to him whose the field is. It is sad to see such tares,
such weeds, in the garden of the Lord; to see the good soil wasted, the
good seed choked, and such a reflection cast on the name and honour of
Christ, as if his field were no better than the field of the slothful,
all grown over with thorns.

\[5.\] The Master was soon aware whence it was ([Mat
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#028).md); An enemy has done this. He
does not lay the blame upon the servants; they could not help it, but
had done what was in their power to prevent it. Note, The ministers of
Christ, that are faithful and diligent, shall not be judged of Christ,
and therefore should not be reproached by men, for the mixtures of bad
with good, hypocrites with the sincere, in the field of the church. It
must needs be that such offences will come; and they shall not be laid
to our charge, if we do our duty, though it have not the desired
success. Though they sleep, if they do not love sleep; though tares be
sown, if they do not sow them nor water them, nor allow of them, the
blame shall not lie at their door.

\[6.\] The servants were very forward to have these tares rooted up.
"Wilt thou that we go and do it presently?" Note, The over-hasty and
inconsiderate zeal of Christ's servants, before they have consulted with
their Master, is sometimes ready, with the hazard of the church, to root
out all that they presume to be tares: Lord, wilt thou that we call for
fire from heaven?

\[7.\] The Master very wisely prevented this ([Mat
13:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#029).md); Nay, lest while ye gather up
the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. Note, It is not possible
for any man infallibly to distinguish between tares and wheat, but he
may be mistaken; and therefore such is the wisdom and grace of Christ,
that he will rather permit the tares, than any way endanger the wheat.
It is certain, scandalous offenders are to be censured, and we are to
withdraw from them; those who are openly the children of the wicked one,
are not to be admitted to special ordinances; yet it is possible there
may be a discipline, either so mistaken in its rules, or so over-nice in
the application of them, as may prove vexatious to many that are truly
godly and conscientious. Great caution and moderation must be used in
inflicting and continuing church censures, lest the wheat be trodden
down, if not plucked up. The wisdom from above, as it is pure, so it is
peaceable, and those who oppose themselves must not be cut off, but
instructed, and with meekness, [Ti2
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#025.md). The tares, if continued under
the means of grace, may become good corn; therefore have patience with
them.

(6.) The harvest is the end of the world, [Mat
13:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#039.md). This world will have an end;
though it continue long, it will not continue always; time will shortly
be swallowed up in eternity. At the end of the world, there will be a
great harvest-day, a day of judgment; at harvest all is ripe and ready
to be cut down: both good and bad are ripe at the great-day, [Rev
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#011.md). It is the harvest of the earth,
[Rev 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#015.md). At harvest the reapers cut
down all before them; not a field, not a corner, is left behind; so at
the great day all must be judged ([Rev
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#012.md), [Rev
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#013).md); God has set a harvest ([Hos
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011).md), and it shall not fail, [Gen
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#022.md). At harvest every man reaps as he
sowed; every man's ground, and seed, and skill, and industry, will be
manifested: see [Gal 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007.md), [Gal
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#008.md). Then they who sowed precious
seed, will come again with rejoicing ([Psa
126:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#005.md), [Psa
126:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#006).md), with the joy of harvest ([Isa
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#003).md); when the sluggard, who would not
plough by reason of cold, shall beg, and have nothing ([Pro
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#004).md); shall cry, Lord, Lord, but in
vain; when the harvest of those who sowed to the flesh, shall be a day
of grief, and of desperate sorrow, [Isa
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#011.md).

(7.) The reapers are the angels: they shall be employed, in the great
day, in executing Christ's righteous sentences, both of approbation and
condemnation, as ministers of his justice, [Mat
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031.md). The angels are skilful, strong,
and swift, obedient servants to Christ, holy enemies to the wicked, and
faithful friends to all the saints, and therefore fit to be thus
employed. He that reapeth receiveth wages, and the angels will not be
unpaid for their attendance; for he that soweth, and he that reapeth,
shall rejoice together ([Joh 4:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#036).md);
that is joy in heaven in the presence of the angels of God.

(8.) Hell-torments are the fire, into which the tares shall then be
cast, and in which they shall be burned. At the great day a distinction
will be made, and with it a vast difference; it will be a notable day
indeed.

\[1.\] The tares will then be gathered out: The reapers (whose primary
work it is to gather in the corn) shall be charged first to gather out
the tares. Note, Though good and bad are together in this world
undistinguished, yet at the great day they shall be parted; no tares
shall then be among the wheat; no sinners among the saints: then you
shall plainly discern between the righteous and the wicked, which here
sometimes it is hard to do, [Mal 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#018.md);
[Mal 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001.md). Christ will not bear always,
[Psa 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001.md), etc. They shall gather out
of his kingdom all wicked things that offend, and all wicked persons
that do iniquity: when he begins, he will make a full end. All those
corrupt doctrines, worships, and practices, which have offended, have
been scandals to the church, and stumbling-blocks to men's consciences,
shall be condemned by the righteous Judge in that day, and consumed by
the brightness of his coming; all the wood, hay, and stubble ([Co1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#012).md); and then woe to them that do
iniquity, that make a trade of it, and persist in it; not only those in
the last age of Christ's kingdom upon earth, but those in every age.
Perhaps here is an allusion to [Zep
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#003.md), I will consume the
stumbling-blocks with the wicked.

\[2.\] They will then be bound in bundles, [Mat
13:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#030.md). Sinners of the same sort will
be bundled together in the great day: a bundle of atheists, a bundle of
epicures, a bundle of persecutors, and a great bundle of hypocrites.
Those who have been associates in sin, will be so in shame and sorrow;
and it will be an aggravation of their misery, as the society of
glorified saints will add to their bliss. Let us pray, as David, Lord,
gather not my soul with sinners ([Psa
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#009).md), but let it be bound in the
bundle of life, with the Lord our God, [Sa1
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#029.md). \[3.\] They will be cast into a
furnace of fire; such will be the end of wicked, mischievous people,
that are in the church as tares in the field; they are fit for nothing
but fire; to it they shall go, it is the fittest place for them. Note,
Hell is a furnace of fire, kindled by the wrath of God, and kept burning
by the bundles of tares cast into it, who will be ever in the consuming,
but never consumed. But he slides out of the metaphor into a description
of those torments that are designed to be set forth by it: There shall
be weeping, and gnashing of teeth; comfortless sorrow, and an incurable
indignation at God, themselves, and one another, will be the endless
torture of damned souls. Let us therefore, knowing these terrors of the
Lord, be persuaded not to do iniquity.

(9.) Heaven is the barn into which all God's wheat shall be gathered in
that harvest-day. But gather the wheat into my barn: so it is in the
parable, [Mat 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#030.md). Note, \[1.\] In
the field of this world good people are the wheat, the most precious
grain, and the valuable part of the field. \[2.\] This wheat shall
shortly be gathered, gathered from among the tares and weeds: all
gathered together in a general assembly, all the Old Testament saints,
all the New Testament saints, not one missing. Gather my saints together
unto me, [Psa 50:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#005.md). \[3.\] All God's
wheat shall be lodged together in God's barn: particular souls are
housed at death as a shock of corn ([Job
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#026).md), but the general in-gathering
will be at the end of time: God's wheat will then be put together, and
no longer scattered; there will be sheaves of corn, as well as bundles
of tares: they will then be secured, and no longer exposed to wind and
weather, sin and sorrow: no longer afar off, and at a great distance, in
the field, but near, in the barn. Nay, heaven is a garner ([Mat
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012).md), in which the wheat will not
only be separated from the tares of ill companions, but sifted from the
chaff of their own corruptions.

In the explanation of the parable, this is gloriously represented ([Mat
13:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#043).md); Then shall the righteous shine
forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. First, It is their
present honour, that God is their Father. Now are we the sons of God
([Jo1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002).md); our Father in heaven is
King there. Christ, when he went to heaven, went to his Father, and our
Father, [Joh 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017.md). It is our Father's
house, nay, it is our Father's palace, his throne, [Rev
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021.md). Secondly, The honour in reserve
for them is, that they shall shine forth as the sun in that kingdom.
Here they are obscure and hidden ([Col
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003).md), their beauty is eclipsed by
their poverty, and the meanness of their outward condition; their own
weaknesses and infirmities, and the reproach and disgrace cast upon
them, cloud them; but then they shall shine forth as the sun from behind
a dark cloud; at death they shall shine forth to themselves; at the
great day they will shine forth publicly before all the world, their
bodies will be made like Christ's glorious body: they shall shine by
reflection, with a light borrowed from the Fountain of light; their
sanctification will be perfected, and their justification published; God
will own them for his children, and will produce the record of all their
services and sufferings for his name: they shall shine as the sun, the
most glorious of all visible beings. The glory of the saints is in the
Old Testament compared to that of the firmament and the stars, but here
to that of the sun; for life and immortality are brought to a much
clearer light by the gospel, than under the law. Those who shine as
lights in this world, that God may be glorified, shall shine as the sun
in the other world, that they may be glorified. Our Saviour concludes,
as before, with a demand of attention; Who hath ears to hear, let him
hear. These are things which it is our happiness to hear of, and our
duty to hearken to.

III\. Here is the parable of the grain of mustard-seed, [Mat
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#031.md), [Mat
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#032.md). The scope of this parable is to
show, that the beginnings of the gospel would be small, but that its
latter end would greatly increase. In this way the gospel church, the
kingdom of God among us, would be set up in the world; in this way the
work of grace in the heart, the kingdom of God within us, would be
carried on in particular persons.

Now concerning the work of the gospel, observe,

1\. That it is commonly very weak and small at first, like a grain of
mustard-seed, which is one of the least of all seeds. The kingdom of the
Messiah, which was now in the setting up, made but a small figure;
Christ and the apostles, compared with the grandees of the world,
appeared like a grain of mustard-seed, the weak things of the world. In
particular places, the first breaking out of the gospel light is but as
the dawning of the day; and in particular souls, it is at first the day
of small things, like a bruised reed. Young converts are like lambs that
must be carried in his arms, [Isa
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011.md). There is a little faith, but
there is much lacking in it ([Th1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#010).md), and the groanings such as
cannot be uttered, they are so small; a principle of spiritual life, and
some motion, but scarcely discernible.

2\. That yet it is growing and coming on. Christ's kingdom strangely got
ground; great accessions were made to it; nations were born at once, in
spite of all the oppositions it met with from hell and earth. In the
soul where grace is true it will grow really, though perhaps insensibly.
A grain of mustard-seed is small, but however it is seed, and has in it
a disposition to grow. Grace will be getting ground, shining more and
more, [Pro 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018.md). Gracious habits
confirmed, actings quickened, and knowledge more clear, faith more
confirmed, love more inflamed; here is the seed growing.

3\. That it will at last come to a great degree of strength and
usefulness; when it is grown to some maturity, it becomes a tree, much
larger in those countries than in ours. The church, like the vine
brought out of Egypt, has taken root, and filled the earth, [Psa
80:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#009.md). The church is like a great
tree, in which the fowls of the air do lodge; God's people have recourse
to it for food and rest, shade and shelter. In particular persons, the
principle of grace, if true, will persevere and be perfected at last:
growing grace will be strong grace, and will bring much to pass. Grown
Christians must covet to be useful to others, as the mustard-seed when
grown is to the birds; that those who dwell near or under their shadow
may be the better for them, [Hos 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#007.md).

IV\. Here is the parable of the leaven, [Mat
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#033.md). The scope of this is much the
same with that of the foregoing parable, to show that the gospel should
prevail and be successful by degrees, but silently and insensibly; the
preaching of the gospel is like leaven, and works like leaven in the
hearts of those who receive it.

1\. A woman took this leaven; it was her work. Ministers are employed in
leavening places, in leavening souls, with the gospel. The woman is the
weaker vessel, and we have this treasure in such vessels.

2\. The leaven was hid in three measures of meal. The heart is, as the
meal, soft and pliable; it is the tender heart that is likely to profit
by the word: leaven among corn unground does not work, nor does the
gospel in souls unhumbled and unbroken for sin: the law grinds the
heart, and then the gospel leavens it. It is three measures of meal, a
great quantity, for a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. The meal
must be kneaded, before it receive the leaven; our hearts, as they must
be broken, so they must be moistened, and pains taken with them to
prepare them for the word, that they may receive the impressions of it.
The leaven must be hid in the heart ([Psa
119:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#011).md), not so much for secrecy (for
it will show itself) as for safety; our inward thought must be upon it,
we must lay it up, as Mary laid up the sayings of Christ, [Luk
2:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#051.md). When the woman hides the leaven
in the meal, it is with an intention that it should communicate its
taste and relish to it; so we must treasure up the word in our souls,
that we may be sanctified by it, [Joh
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017.md).

3\. The leaven thus hid in the dough, works there, it ferments; the word
is quick and powerful, [Heb 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012.md). The
leaven works speedily, so does the word, and yet gradually. What a
sudden change did Elijah's mantle make upon Elisha! [Kg1
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#020.md). It works silently and
insensibly ([Mar 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#026).md), yet strongly
and irresistibly: it does its work without noise, for so is the way of
the Spirit, but does it without fail. Hide but the leaven in the dough,
and all the world cannot hinder it from communicating its taste and
relish to it, and yet none sees how it is done, but by degrees the whole
is leavened.

(1.) Thus it was in the world. The apostles, by their preaching, hid a
handful of leaven in the great mass of mankind, and it had a strange
effect; it put the world into a ferment, and in a sense turned it upside
down ([Act 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#006).md), and by degrees made
a wonderful change in the taste and relish of it: the savour of the
gospel was manifested in every place, [Co2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#014.md); [Rom
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#019.md). It was thus effectual, not by
outward force, and therefore not by any such force resistible and
conquerable, but by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts, who works, and none
can hinder.

(2.) Thus it is in the heart. When the gospel comes into the soul,
\[1.\] It works a change, not in the substance; the dough is the same,
but in the quality; it makes us to savour otherwise than we have done,
and other things to savour with us otherwise than they used to do, [Rom
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#005.md). \[2.\] It works a universal
change; it diffuses itself into all the powers and faculties of the
soul, and alters the property even of the members of the body, [Rom
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#013.md). \[3.\] This change is such as
makes the soul to partake of the nature of the word, as the dough does
of the leaven. We are delivered into it as into a mould ([Rom
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#017).md), changed into the same image
([Co2 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018).md), like the impression of
the seal upon the wax. The gospel savours of God, and Christ, and free
grace, and another world, and these things now relish with the soul. It
is a word of faith and repentance, holiness and love, and these are
wrought in the soul by it. This savour is communicated insensibly, for
our life is hid; but inseparably, for grace is a good part that shall
never be taken away from those who have it. When the dough is leavened,
then to the oven with it; trials and afflictions commonly attend this
change; but thus saints are fitted to be bread for our Master's table.

[Matthew 13:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mat 13:44</span></span>

We have four short parables in these verses.

I. That of the treasure hid in the field. Hitherto he had compared the
kingdom of heaven to small things, because its beginning was small; but,
lest any should thence take occasion to think meanly of it, in this
parable and the next he represents it as of great value in itself, and
of great advantage to those who embrace it, and are willing to come up
to its terms; it is here likened to a treasure hid in the field, which,
if we will, we may make our own.

1\. Jesus Christ is the true Treasure; in him there is an abundance of
all that which is rich and useful, and will be a portion for us: all
fulness ([Col 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019.md); [Joh
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016).md): treasures of wisdom and
knowledge ([Col 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003).md), of
righteousness, grace, and peace; these are laid up for us in Christ;
and, if we have an interest in him, it is all our own.

2\. The gospel is the field in which this treasure is hid: it is hid in
the word of the gospel, both the Old Testament and the New Testament
gospel. In gospel ordinances it is hid as the milk in the breast, the
marrow in the bone, the manna in the dew, the water in the well ([Isa
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#003).md), the honey in the honey-comb. It
is hid, not in a garden enclosed, or a spring shut up, but in a field,
an open field; whoever will, let him come, and search the scriptures;
let him dig in this field ([Pro 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#004).md);
and whatever royal mines we find, they are all our own, if we take the
right course.

3\. It is a great thing to discover the treasure hid in this field, and
the unspeakable value of it. The reason why so many slight the gospel,
and will not be at the expense, and run the hazard, of entertaining it,
is because they look only upon the surface of the field, and judge by
that, and so see no excellency in the Christian institutes above those
of the philosophers; nay, the richest mines are often in grounds that
appear most barren; and therefore they will not so much as bid for the
field, much less come up to the price. What is thy beloved more than
another beloved? What is the Bible more than other good books? The
gospel of Christ more than Plato's philosophy, or Confucius's morals:
but those who have searched the scriptures, so as in them to find Christ
and eternal life ([Joh 5:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#039).md), have
discovered such a treasure in this field as makes it infinitely more
valuable.

4\. Those who discern this treasure in the field, and value it aright,
will never be easy till they have made it their own upon any terms. He
that has found this treasure, hides it, which denotes a holy jealousy,
lest we come short ([Heb 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#001).md), looking
diligently ([Heb 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015).md), lest Satan
come between us and it. He rejoices in it, though as yet the bargain be
not made; he is glad there is such a bargain to be had, and that he is
in a fair way to have an interest in Christ; that the matter is in
treaty: their hearts may rejoice, who are yet but seeking the Lord, [Psa
105:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#003.md). He resolves to buy this field:
they who embrace gospel offers, upon gospel terms, buy this field; they
make it their own, for the sake of the unseen treasure in it. It is
Christ in the gospel that we are to have an eye to; we need not go up to
heaven, but Christ in the word is nigh us. And so intent he is upon it,
that he sells all to buy this field: they who would have saving benefit
by Christ, must be willing to part with all, that they may make it sure
to themselves; must count every thing but loss, that they may win
Christ, and be found in him.

II\. That of the pearl of price ([Mat
13:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#045.md), [Mat
13:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#046).md), which is to the same purport
with the former, of the treasure. The dream is thus doubled, for the
thing is certain.

Note, 1. All the children of men are busy, seeking goodly pearls: one
would be rich, another would be honourable, another would be learned;
but the most are imposed upon, and take up with counterfeits for pearls.

2\. Jesus Christ is a Pearl of great price, a Jewel of inestimable
value, which will make those who have it rich, truly rich, rich toward
God; in having him, we have enough to make us happy here and for ever.

3\. A true Christian is a spiritual merchant, that seeks and finds this
pearl of price; that does not take up with any thing short of an
interest in Christ, and, as one that is resolved to be spiritually rich,
trades high: He went and bought that pearl; did not only bid for it, but
purchased it. What will it avail us to know Christ, if we do not know
him as ours, made to us wisdom? [Co1
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030.md).

4\. Those who would have a saving interest in Christ, must be willing to
part with all for him, leave all to follow him. Whatever stands in
opposition to Christ, or in competition with him for our love and
service, we must cheerfully quit it, though ever so dear to us. A man
may buy gold too dear, but not this pearl of price.

III\. That of the net cast into the sea, [Mat
13:47-49](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#047.md).

1\. Here is the parable itself. Where note, (1.) The world is a vast
sea, and the children of men are things creeping innumerable, both small
and great, in that sea, [Psa 104:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#025.md).
Men in their natural state are like the fishes of the sea that have no
ruler over them, [Hab 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#014). (2..md) The
preaching of the gospel is the casting of a net into this sea, to catch
something out of it, for his glory who has the sovereignty of the sea.
Ministers are fishers of men, employed in casting and drawing this net;
and then they speed, when at Christ's word they let down the net;
otherwise, they toil and catch nothing. (3.) This net gathers of every
kind, as large dragnets do. In the visible church there is a deal of
trash and rubbish, dirt and weeds and vermin, as well as fish. (4.)
There is a time coming when this net will be full, and drawn to the
shore; a set time when the gospel shall have fulfilled that for which it
was sent, and we are sure it shall not return void, [Isa
55:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#010.md), [Isa
55:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#011.md). The net is now filling;
sometimes it fills faster than at other times, but still it fills, and
will be drawn to shore, when the mystery of God shall be finished. (5.)
When the net is full and drawn to the shore, there shall be a separation
between the good and bad that were gathered in it. Hypocrites and true
Christians shall then be parted; the good shall be gathered into
vessels, as valuable, and therefore to be carefully kept, but the bad
shall be cast away, as vile and unprofitable; and miserable is the
condition of those who are cast away in that day. While the net is in
the sea, it is not known what is in it, the fishermen themselves cannot
distinguish; but they carefully draw it, and all that is in it, to the
shore, for the sake of the good that is in it. Such is God's care for
the visible church, and such should ministers' concern be for those
under their charge, though they are mixed.

2\. Here is the explanation of the latter part of the parable, the
former is obvious and plain enough: we see gathered in the visible
church, some of every kind: but the latter part refers to that which is
yet to come, and is therefore more particularly explained, [Mat
13:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#049.md), [Mat
13:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#050.md). So shall it be at the end of
the world; then, and not till then, will the dividing, discovering day
be. We must not look for the net full of all good fish; the vessels will
be so, but in the net they are mixed. See here, (1.) The distinguishing
of the wicked from the righteous. The angels of heaven shall come forth
to do that which the angels of the churches could never do; they shall
sever the wicked from among the just; and we need not ask how they will
distinguish them when they have both their commission and their
instructions from him that knows all men, and particularly knows them
that are his, and them that are not, and we may be sure there shall be
no mistake or blunder either way. (2.) The doom of the wicked when they
are thus severed. They shall be cast into the furnace, Note, Everlasting
misery and sorrow will certainly be the portion of those who live among
sanctified ones, but themselves die unsanctified. This is the same with
what we had before, [Mat 13:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#042.md). Note,
Christ himself preached often of hell-torments, as the everlasting
punishment of hypocrites; and it is good for us to be often reminded of
this awakening, quickening truth.

IV\. Here is the parable of the good householder, which is intended to
rivet all the rest.

1\. The occasion of it was the good proficiency which the disciples had
made in learning, and their profiting by this sermon in particular. (1.)
He asked them, Have ye understood all these things? Intimating, that if
they had not, he was ready to explain what they did not understand.
Note, It is the will of Christ, that all those who read and hear the
word should understand it; for otherwise how should they get good by it?
It is therefore good for us, when we have read or heard the word, to
examine ourselves, or to be examined, whether we have understood it or
not. It is no disparagement to the disciples of Christ to be catechised.
Christ invites us to seek to him for instruction, and ministers should
proffer their service to those who have any good question to ask
concerning what they have heard. (2.) They answered him, Yea, Lord: and
we have reason to believe they said true, because, when they did not
understand, they asked for an explication, [Mat
13:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#036.md). And the exposition of that
parable was a key to the rest. Note, The right understanding of one good
sermon, will very much help us to understand another; for good truths
mutually explain and illustrate one another; and knowledge is easy to
him that understandeth.

2\. The scope of the parable itself was to give his approbation and
commendation of their proficiency. Note, Christ is ready to encourage
willing learners in his school, though they are but weak; and to say,
Well done, well said.

(1.) He commends them as scribes instructed unto the kingdom of heaven.
They were now learning that they might teach, and the teachers among the
Jews were the scribes. Ezra, who prepared his heart to teach in Israel,
is called a ready scribe, [Ezr 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#006.md),
[Ezr 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#010.md). Now a skilful, faithful
minister of the gospel is a scribe too; but for distinction, he is
called a scribe instructed unto the kingdom of heaven, well versed in
the things of the gospel, and well able to teach those things. Note,
\[1.\] Those who are to instruct others, have need to be well instructed
themselves. If the priest's lips must keep knowledge, his head must
first have knowledge. \[2.\] The instruction of a gospel minister must
be in the kingdom of heaven, that is it about which his business lies. A
man may be a great philosopher and politician, and yet if not instructed
to the kingdom of heaven, he will make but a bad minister.

(2.) He compares them to a good householder, who brings forth out of his
treasure things new and old; fruits of last year's growth and this
year's gathering, abundance and variety, for the entertainment of his
friends, [Sol 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#013.md). See here, \[1.\]
What should be a minister's furniture, a treasure of things new and old.
Those who have so many and various occasions, have need to stock
themselves well in their gathering days with truths new and old, out of
the Old Testament and out of the new; with ancient and modern
improvements, that the man of God may be thoroughly furnished, [Ti2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016.md), [Ti2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#017.md). Old experiences, and new
observations, all have their use; and we must not content ourselves with
old discoveries, but must be adding new. Live and learn. \[2.\] What use
he should make of this furniture; he should bring forth: laying up is in
order to laying out, for the benefit of others. Sic vox non vobis - You
are to lay up, but not for yourselves. Many are full, but they have no
vent ([Job 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#019).md); have a talent, but
they bury it; such are unprofitable servants; Christ himself received
that he might give; so must we, and we shall have more. In bringing
forth, things new and old do best together; old truths, but new methods
and expressions, especially new affections.

[Matthew 13:53](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">mat 13:53</span></span>

We have here Christ in his own country. He went about doing good, yet
left not any place till he had finished his testimony there at that
time. His own countrymen had rejected him once, yet he came to them
again. Note, Christ does not take refusers at their first word, but
repeats his offers to those who have often repulsed them. In this, as in
other things, Christ was like his brethren; he had a natural affection
to his own country; Patriam quisque amat, non quia pulchram, sed quia
suam - Every one loves his country, not because it is beautiful, but
because it is his own. Seneca. His treatment this time was much the same
as before, scornful and spiteful. Observe,

I. How they expressed their contempt of him. When he taught them in
their synagogue, they were astonished; not that they were taken with his
preaching, or admired his doctrine in itself, but only that it should be
his; looking upon him as unlikely to be such a teacher. Two things they
upbraided him with.

1\. His want of academical education. They owned that he had wisdom, and
did mighty works; but the question was, Whence he had them: for they
knew that he was not brought up at the feet of the rabbin: he had never
been at the university, nor taken his degree, nor was called of men,
Rabbi, Rabbi. Note, Mean and prejudiced spirits are apt to judge of men
by their education, and to enquire more into their rise than into their
reasons. "Whence has this man these mighty works? Did he come honestly
by them? Has he not been studying the black art?" Thus they turned that
against him which was really for him; for if they had not been wilfully
blind, they must have concluded him to be divinely assisted and
commissioned, who without the help of education gave such proofs of
extraordinary wisdom and power.

2\. The meanness and poverty of his relations, [Mat
13:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#055.md), [Mat
13:56](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#056.md).

(1.) They upbraid him with his father. Is not this the carpenter's son?
Yes, it is true he was reputed so: and what harm in that? No
disparagement to him to be the son of an honest tradesman. They remember
not (though they might have known it) that this carpenter was of the
house of David ([Luk 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#027).md), a son of
David ([Mat 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020).md); though a carpenter,
yet a person of honour. Those who are willing to pick quarrels will
overlook that which is worthy and deserving, and fasten upon that only
which seems mean. Some sordid spirits regard no branch, no not the
Branch from the stem of Jesse ([Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001).md), if it be not the top branch.

(2.) They upbraid him with his mother; and what quarrel have they with
her? Why, truly, his mother is called Mary, and that was a very common
name, and they all knew her, and knew her to be an ordinary person; she
was called Mary, not Queen Mary, nor Lady Mary, nor so much as Mistress
Mary, but plain Mary; and this is turned to his reproach, as if men had
nothing to be valued by but foreign extraction, noble birth, or splendid
titles; poor things to measure worth by.

(3.) They upbraid him with his brethren, whose names they knew, and had
them ready enough to serve this turn; James, and Joses, and Simon, and
Judas, good men but poor men, and therefore despised; and Christ for
their sakes. These brethren, it is probable, were Joseph's children by a
former wife; or whatever their relation was to him, they seem to have
been brought up with him in the same family. And therefore of the
calling of three of these, who were of the twelve, to that honour
(James, Simon, and Jude, the same with Thaddeus), we read not
particularly, because they needed not such an express call into
acquaintance with Christ who had been the companions of his youth.

(4.) His sisters too are all with us; they should therefore have loved
him and respected him the more, because he was one of themselves, but
therefore they despised him. They were offended in him: they stumbled at
these stumbling-stones, for he was set for a sign that should be spoken
against, [Luk 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#034.md); [Isa
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md).

II\. See how he resented this contempt, [Mat
13:57](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#057.md), [Mat
13:58](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#058.md).

1\. It did not trouble his heart. It appears he was not much concerned
at it; he despised the shame, [Heb
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002.md). Instead of aggravating the
affront, or expressing an offence at it, or returning such an answer to
their foolish suggestions as they deserved, he mildly imputes it to the
common humour of the children of men, to undervalue excellences that are
cheap, and common, and home-bred. It is usually so. A prophet is not
without honour, save in his own country. Note, (1.) Prophets should have
honour paid them, and commonly have; men of God are great men, and men
of honour, and challenge respect. It is strange indeed if prophets have
not honour. (2.) Notwithstanding this, they are commonly least regarded
and reverenced in their own country, nay, and sometimes are most envied.
Familiarity breeds contempt.

2\. It did for the present (to speak with reverence), in effect, tie his
hands: He did not many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.
Note, Unbelief is the great obstruction to Christ's favours. All things
are in general possible to God ([Mat
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#026).md), but then it is to him that
believes as to the particulars, [Mar
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#023.md). The gospel is the power of God
unto salvation, but then it is to every one that believes, [Rom
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016.md). So that if mighty works be not
wrought in us, it is not for want of power or grace in Christ, but for
want of faith in us. By grace ye are saved, and that is a mighty work,
but it is through faith, [Eph 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008.md).
