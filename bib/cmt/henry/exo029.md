### [Exodus Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 29:0</span></span>

Particular orders are given in this chapter, I. Concerning the
consecration of the priests, and the sanctification of the altar (v.
1-37). II. Concerning the daily sacrifice ([Exo
29:38-41](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038).md). To which gracious promises
are annexed that God would own and bless them in all their services
([Exo 29:42](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#042), etc..md).

[Exodus 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 29:1</span></span>

Here is, I. The law concerning the consecration of Aaron and his sons to
the priest's office, which was to be done with a great deal of ceremony
and solemnity, that they themselves might be duly affected with the
greatness of the work to which they were called, and that the people
also might learn to magnify the office and none might dare to invade it.

1\. The ceremonies wherewith it was to be done were very fully and
particularly appointed, because nothing of this kind had been done
before, and because it was to be a statute for ever that the high priest
should be thus inaugurated. Now,

(1.) The work to be done was the consecrating of the persons whom God
had chosen to be priests, by which they devoted and gave up themselves
to the service of God and God declared his acceptance of them; and the
people were made to know that they glorified not themselves to be made
priests, but were called of God, [Heb
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#004.md), [Heb
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#005.md). They were thus distinguished from
common men, sequestered from common services, and set apart for God and
an immediate attendance on him. Note, All that are to be employed for
God are to be sanctified to him. The person must first be accepted, and
then the performance. The Hebrew phrase for consecrating is filling the
hand ([Exo 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#009).md): Thou shalt fill the
hand of Aaron and his sons, and the ram of consecration is the ram of
fillings, [Exo 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#022.md), [Exo
29:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#026.md). The consecrating of them was
the perfecting of them; Christ is said to be perfect or consecrated for
evermore, [Heb 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#028.md). Probably the
phrase here is borrowed from the putting of the sacrifice into their
hand, to be waved before the Lord, [Exo
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#024.md). But it intimates, \[1.\] That
ministers have their hands full; they have no time to trifle, so great,
so copious, so constant is their work. \[2.\] That they must have their
hands filled. Of necessity they must have something to offer, and they
cannot find it in themselves, it must be given them from above. They
cannot fill the people's hearts unless God fill their hands; to him
therefore they must go, and receive from his fulness.

(2.) The person to do it was Moses, by God's appointment. Though he was
ordained for men, yet the people were not to consecrate him; Moses the
servant of the Lord, and his agent herein, must do it. By God's special
appointment he now did the priest's work, and therefore that which was
the priest's part of the sacrifice was here ordered to be his, [Exo
29:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#026.md).

(3.) The place was at the door of the tabernacle of meeting, [Exo
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#004.md). God was pleased to dwell in the
tabernacle, the people attending in the courts, so that the door between
the court and the tabernacle was the fittest place for those to be
consecrated in who were to mediate between God and man, and to stand
between both, and lay their hands (as it were) upon both. They were
consecrated at the door, for they were to be door-keepers.

(4.) It was done with many ceremonies.

\[1.\] They were to be washed ([Exo
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#004).md), signifying that those must be
clean who bear the vessels of the Lord, [Isa
52:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#011.md). Those that would perfect
holiness must cleanse themselves from all filthiness of flesh and
spirit, [Co2 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001.md); [Isa
1:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#016.md). They were now washed all
over; but afterwards, when they went in to minister, they washed only
their hands and feet ([Exo 30:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#019).md); for
he that is washed needs no more, [Joh
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#010.md).

\[2.\] They were to be clothed with the holy garments ([Exo
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#005.md), [Exo
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#006.md), [Exo
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#008.md), [Exo
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#009).md), to signify that it was not
sufficient for them to put away the pollutions of sin, but they must put
on the graces of the Spirit, be clothed with righteousness, [Psa
132:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#009.md). They must be girded, as men
prepared and strengthened for their work; and they must be robed and
crowned, as men that counted their work and office their true honour.

\[3.\] The high priest was to be anointed with the holy anointing oil
([Exo 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#007).md), that the church might be
filled and delighted with the sweet savour of his administrations (for
ointment and perfume rejoice the heart), and in token of the pouring out
of the Spirit upon him, to qualify him for his work. Brotherly love is
compared to this oil with which Aaron was anointed, [Psa
133:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#002.md). The inferior priests are said
to be anointed ([Exo 30:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#030).md), not on
their heads, as the high priest ([Lev
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#010).md), the oil was only mingled with
the blood that was sprinkled upon their garments.

\[4.\] Sacrifices were to be offered for them. The covenant of
priesthood, as all other covenants, must be made by sacrifice.

First, There must be a sin-offering, to make atonement for them, [Exo
29:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#010.md). The law made those priests
that had infirmity, and therefore they must first offer for their own
sin, before they could make atonement for the people, [Heb
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#027.md), [Heb
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#028.md). They were to put their hand on
the head of their sacrifice ([Exo
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#010).md), confessing that they deserved
to die for their own sin, and desiring that the killing of the beast
might expiate their guilt, and be accepted as a vicarious satisfaction.
It was used as other sin-offerings were; only, whereas the flesh of
other sin-offerings was eaten by the priests ([Lev
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#018).md), in token of the priest's
taking away the sin of the people, this was appointed to be all burnt
without the camp ([Exo 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#014).md), to
signify the imperfection of the legal dispensation (as the learned
bishop Patrick notes); for the sins of the priests themselves could not
be taken away by those sacrifices, but they must expect a better high
priest and a better sacrifice.

Secondly, There must be a burnt-offering, a ram wholly burnt, to the
honour of God, in token of the dedication of themselves wholly to God
and to his service, as living sacrifices, kindled with the fire and
ascending in the flame of holy love, [Exo
29:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#015.md). The sin-offering must first
be offered and then the burnt-offering; for, till guilt be removed, no
acceptable service can be performed, [Isa
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#007.md).

Thirdly, There must be a peace-offering; it is called the ram of
consecration, because there was more in this peculiar to the occasion
than in the other two. In the burnt-offering God had the glory of their
priesthood, in this they had the comfort of it; and, in token of a
mutual covenant between God and them, 1. The blood of the sacrifice was
divided between God and them ([Exo
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#020.md), [Exo
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#021).md); part of the blood was
sprinkled upon the altar round about, and part put upon them, upon their
bodies ([Exo 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#020).md), and upon their
garments, [Exo 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#021.md). Thus the benefit
of the expiation made by the sacrifice was applied and assured to them,
and their whole selves from head to foot sanctified to the service of
God. The blood was put upon the extreme parts of the body, to signify
that it was all, as it were, enclosed and taken in for God, the tip of
the ear and the great toe not excepted. We reckon that the blood and oil
sprinkled upon garments spot and stain them; yet the holy oil, and the
blood of the sacrifice, sprinkled upon their garments, must be looked
upon as the greatest adorning imaginable to them, for they signified the
blood of Christ, and the graces of the Spirit, which constitute and
complete the beauty of holiness, and recommend us to God; we read of
robes made white with the blood of the Lamb. 2. The flesh of the
sacrifice, with the meat-offering annexed to it, was likewise divided
between God and them, that (to speak with reverence) God and they might
feast together, in token of friendship and fellowship. (1.) Part of it
was to be first waved before the Lord, and then burnt upon the altar;
part of the flesh ([Exo 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#022).md), part
of the bread, for bread and flesh must go together ([Exo
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#023).md); these were first put into the
hands of Aaron to be waved to and fro, in token of their being offered
to God (who, though unseen, yet compasses us round on every side), and
then they were to be burnt upon the altar ([Exo
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#024.md), [Exo
29:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#025).md), for the altar was to devour
God's part of the sacrifice. Thus God admitted Aaron and his sons to be
his servants, and wait at his table, taking the mat of his altar from
their hands. Here, in a parenthesis, as it were, comes in the law
concerning the priests' part of the peace-offerings afterwards, the
breast and shoulder, which were now divided; Moses had the breast, and
the shoulder was burnt on the altar with God's part, [Exo
29:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#026). (2..md) The other part, both of
the flesh of the ram and of the bread, Aaron and his sons were to eat at
the door of the tabernacle ([Exo
29:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#031).md), to signify that he called
them not only servants but friends, [Joh
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015.md). He supped with them, and they
with him. Their eating of the things wherewith the atonement was made
signified their receiving the atonement, as the expression is ([Rom
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#011).md), their thankful acceptance of
the benefit of it, and their joyful communion with God thereupon, which
was the true intent and meaning of a feast upon a sacrifice. If any of
it was left, it must be burnt, that it might not be in any danger of
putrefying, and to show that it was an extraordinary peace-offering.

2\. The time that was to be spent in this consecration: Seven days shalt
thou consecrate them, [Exo 29:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#035.md).
Though all the ceremonies were performed on the first day, yet, (1.)
They were not to look upon their consecration as completed till the
seven days' end, which put a solemnity upon their admission, and a
distance between this and their former state, and obliged them to enter
upon their work with a pause, giving them time to consider the weight
and seriousness of it. This was to be observed in after-ages, [Exo
29:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#030.md). He that was to succeed Aaron in
the high-priesthood must put on the holy garments seven days together,
in token of a deliberate and gradual advance into his office, and that
one sabbath might pass over him in his consecration. (2.) Every day of
the seven, in this first consecration, a bullock was to be offered for a
sin-offering ([Exo 29:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#036).md), which was
to intimate to them, \[1.\] That it was of very great concern to them to
get their sins pardoned, and that though atonement was made, and they
had the comfort of it, yet they must still keep up a penitent sense of
sin and often repeat the confession of it. \[2.\] That those sacrifices
which were thus offered day by day to make atonement could not make the
comers thereunto perfect, for then they would have ceased to be offered,
as the apostle argues, [Heb 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md), [Heb
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#002.md). They must therefore expect the
bringing in of a better hope.

3\. This consecration of the priests was a shadow of good things to
come. (1.) Our Lord Jesus is the great high-priest of our profession,
called of God to be so, consecrated for evermore, anointed with the
Spirit above his fellows (whence he is called Messiah, the Christ),
clothed with the holy garments, even with glory and beauty, sanctified
by his own blood, not that of bullocks and rams ([Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012).md), made perfect, or consecrated,
through sufferings, [Heb 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010.md). Thus in
him this was a perpetual statute, [Exo
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#009). (2..md) All believers are spiritual
priests, to offer spiritual sacrifices ([Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005).md), washed in the blood of Christ,
and so made to our God priests, [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md), [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006.md). They also are clothed with the
beauty of holiness, and have received the anointing, [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027.md). Their hands are filled with
work, to which they must continually attend; and it is through Christ,
the great sacrifice, that they are dedicated to this service. His blood
sprinkled upon the conscience purges it from dead works, that they may,
as priests, serve the living God. The Spirit of God (as Ainsworth notes)
is called the finger of God ([Luk
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#020.md), compared with [Mat
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#028).md), and by him the merit of Christ
is effectually applied to our souls, as here Moses with his finger was
to put the blood upon Aaron. It is likewise intimated that gospel
ministers are to be solemnly set apart to the work of the ministry with
great deliberation and seriousness both in the ordainers and in the
ordained, as those that are to be employed in a great work and entrusted
with a great charge.

II\. The consecration of the altar, which seems to have been coincident
with that of the priests, and the sin-offerings which were offered every
day for seven days together had reference to the altar as well as the
priests, [Exo 29:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#036.md), [Exo
29:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#037.md). An atonement was made for the
altar. Though that was not a subject capable of sin, nor, having never
yet been used, could it be said to be polluted with the sins of the
people, yet, since the fall, there can be no sanctification to God but
there must first be an atonement for sin, which renders us both unworthy
and unfit to be employed for God. The altar was also sanctified, not
only set apart itself to a sacred use, but made so holy as to sanctify
the gifts that were offered upon it, [Mat
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#019.md). Christ is our altar; for our
sakes he sanctified himself, that we and our performances might be
sanctified and recommended to God, [Joh
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#019.md).

[Exodus 29:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">exo 29:38</span></span>

In this paragraph we have,

I. The daily service appointed. A lamb was to be offered upon the altar
every morning, and a lamb every evening, each with a meat-offering, both
made by fire, as a continual burnt-offering throughout their
generations, [Exo 29:38-41](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038.md). Whether
there were any other sacrifices to be offered or not, these were sure to
be offered, at the public charge, for the benefit and comfort of all
Israel, to make atonement for their daily sins, and to be an
acknowledgement to God of their daily mercies. This was that which the
duty of every day required. The taking away of this daily sacrifice by
Antiochus, for so many evenings and mornings, was that great calamity of
the church which was foretold, [Dan
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#011.md). Note, 1. This typified the
continual intercession which Christ ever lives to make, in virtue of his
satisfaction, for the continual sanctification of his church: though he
offered himself once for all, yet that one offering thus becomes a
continual offering. 2. This teaches us to offer up to God the spiritual
sacrifices of prayer and praise every day, morning and evening, in
humble acknowledgement of our dependence upon him and our obligations to
him. Our daily devotions must be looked upon as the most needful of our
daily works and the most pleasant of our daily comforts. Whatever
business we have, this must never be omitted, either morning or evening;
prayer-time must be kept up as duly as meat-time. The daily sacrifices
were as the daily meals in God's house, and therefore they were always
attended with bread and wine. Those starve their own souls that keep not
up a constant attendance on the throne of grace.

II\. Great and precious promises made of God's favour to Israel, and the
tokens of his special presence with them, while they thus kept up his
institutions among them. He speaks as one well pleased with the
appointment of the daily sacrifice; for, before he proceeds to the other
appointments that follow, he interposes these promises. It is constancy
in religion that brings in the comfort of it. He promises, 1. That he
would keep up communion with them; that he would not only meet Moses,
and speak to him, but that he would meet the children of Israel, ([Exo
29:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#043).md), to accept the daily sacrifices
offered up on their behalf. Note, God will not fail to give those the
meeting who diligently and conscientiously attend upon him in the
ordinances of his own appointment. 2. That he would own his own
institutions, the tabernacle, the altar, the priesthood ([Exo
29:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#043.md), [Exo
29:44](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#044).md); he would take possession of
that which was consecrated to him. Note, What is sanctified to the glory
of God shall be sanctified by his glory. If we do our part, God will do
his, and will mark and fit that for himself which is in sincerity given
up to him. 3. That he would reside among them as God in covenant with
them, and would give them sure and comfortable tokens of his peculiar
favour to them, and his special presence with them ([Exo
29:45](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#045.md), [Exo
29:46](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#046).md): I will dwell among the
children of Israel. Note, Where God sets up the tabernacle of his
ordinances he will himself dwell. Lo, I am with you always, [Mat
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020.md). Those that abide in God's house
shall have God to abide with them. I will be their God, and they shall
know that I am so. Note, Those are truly happy that have a
covenant-interest in God as theirs and the comfortable evidence of that
interest. If we have this, we have enough, and need no more to make us
happy.
