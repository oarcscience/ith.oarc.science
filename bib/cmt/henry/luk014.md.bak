### [Luke Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#001.md)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 14:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have, I. The cure which our Lord Jesus wrought upon a
man that had the dropsy, on the sabbath day, and his justifying himself
therein against those who were offended at his doing it on that day
([Luk 14:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#001).md). II. A lesson of
humility gives to those who were ambitious of the highest rooms ([Luk
14:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#007).md). III. A lesson of charity to
those who feasted the rich, and did not feed the poor ([Luk
14:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#012).md). IV. The success of the
gospel not foretold in the parable of the guests invited to a feast,
signifying the rejection of the Jews and all others that set their
hearts upon this world, and the entertainment of the Gentiles and all
others that come to be filled with Christ ([Luk
14:15-24](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#015).md). V. The great law of
discipleship laid down, with a caution to all that will be Christ's
disciples to undertake it deliberately and with consideration, and
particularly to ministers, to retain their savour ([Luk
14:25-35](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#025).md).

[Luke 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 14:1</span></span>

In this passage of story we find,

I. That the Son of man came eating and drinking, conversing familiarly
with all sorts of people; not declining the society of publicans, though
they were of ill fame, nor of Pharisees, though they bore him ill will,
but accepting the friendly invitations both of the one and the other,
that, if possible, he might do good to both. Here he went into the house
of one of the chief Pharisees, a ruler, it may be, and a magistrate in
his country, to eat bread on the sabbath day, [Luk
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#001.md). See how favourable God is to us,
that he allows us time, even on his own day, for bodily refreshments;
and how careful we should be not to abuse that liberty, or turn it into
licentiousness. Christ went only to eat bread, to take such refreshment
as was necessary on the sabbath day. Our sabbath meals must, with a
particular care, be guarded against all manner of excess. On sabbath
days we must do as Moses and Jethro did, eat bread before God ([Exo
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#012).md), and, as is said of the
primitive Christians, on the Lord's day, must eat and drink as those
that must pray again before we go to rest, that we may not be unfit for
that.

II\. That he went about doing good. Wherever he came he sought
opportunities to do good, and not only improved those that fell in his
way. Here was a certain man before him who had the dropsy, [Luk
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#002.md). We do not find that he offered
himself, or that his friends offered him to be Christ's patient, but
Christ prevented him with the blessings of his goodness, and before he
called he answered him. Note, It is a happy thing to be where Christ is,
to be present before him, though we be not presented to him. This man
had the dropsy, it is probable, in a high degree, and appeared much
swoln with it; probably he was some relation of the Pharisee's, that now
lodged in his house, which is more likely than that he should be an
invited guest at the table.

III\. That he endured the contradiction of sinners against himself: They
watched him, [Luk 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#001.md). The Pharisee
that invited him, it should seem, did it with a design to pick some
quarrel with him; if it were so, Christ knew it, and yet went, for he
knew himself a match for the most subtle of them, and knew how to order
his steps with an eye to his observers. Those that are watched had need
to be wary. It is, as Dr. Hammond observes, contrary to all laws of
hospitality to seek advantage against one that you invited to be your
guest, for such a one you have taken under your protection. These
lawyers and Pharisees, like the fowler that lies in wait to ensnare the
birds, held their peace, and acted very silently. When Christ asked them
whether they thought it lawful to heal on the sabbath day (and herein he
is said to answer them, for it was an answer to their thoughts, and
thoughts are words to Jesus Christ), they would say neither yea nor nay,
for their design was to inform against him, not to be informed by him.
They would not say it was lawful to heal, for then they would preclude
themselves from imputing it to him as a crime; and yet the thing was so
plain and self-evident that they could not for shame say it was not
lawful. Note, Good men have often been persecuted for doing that which
even their persecutors, if they would but give their consciences leave
to speak out, could not but own to be lawful and good. Many a good work
Christ did, for which they cast stones at him and his name.

IV\. That Christ would not be hindered from doing good by the opposition
and contradiction of sinners. He took him, and healed him, and let him
go, [Luk 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#004.md). Perhaps he took him
aside into another room, and healed him there, because he would neither
proclaim himself, such was his humility, nor provoke his adversaries,
such was his wisdom, his meekness of wisdom. Note, Though we must not be
driven off from our duty by the malice of our enemies, yet we should
order the circumstances of it so as to make it the least offensive. Or,
He took him, that is, he laid hands on him, to cure him; epilabomenos,
complexus - he embraced him, took him in his arms, big and unwieldy as
he was (for so dropsical people generally are), and reduced him to
shape. The cure of a dropsy, as much as any disease, one would think,
should be gradual; yet Christ cured even that disease, perfectly cured
it, in a moment. He then let him go, lest the Pharisees should fall upon
him for being healed, though he was purely passive; for what absurdities
would not such men as they were be guilty of?

V. That our Lord Jesus did nothing but what he could justify, to the
conviction and confusion of those that quarrelled with him, [Luk
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#005.md), [Luk
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#006.md). He still answered their
thoughts, and made them hold their peace for shame who before held their
peace for subtlety, by an appeal to their own practice, as he had been
used to do upon such occasions, that he might show them how in
condemning him they condemned themselves: which of you shall have an ass
or an ox fallen into a pit, by accident, and will not pull him out on
the sabbath day, and that straightway, not deferring it till the sabbath
be over, lest it perish? Observe, It is not so much out of compassion to
the poor creature that they do it as a concern for their own interest.
It is their own ox, and their own ass, that is worth money, and they
will dispense with the law of the sabbath for the saving of. Now this
was an evidence of their hypocrisy, and that it was not out of any real
regard to the sabbath that they found fault with Christ for healing on
the sabbath day (that was only the pretence), but really because they
were angry at the miraculous good works which Christ wrought, and the
proof he thereby gave of his divine mission, and the interest he thereby
gained among the people. Many can easily dispense with that, for their
own interest, which they cannot dispense with for God's glory and the
good of their brethren. This question silenced them: They could not
answer him again to these things, [Luk
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#006.md). Christ will be justified when he
speaks, and every mouth must be stopped before him.

[Luke 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 14:7</span></span>

Our Lord Jesus here sets us an example of profitable edifying discourse
at our tables, when we are in company with our friends. We find that
when he had none but his disciples, who were his own family, with him at
his table, his discourse with them was good, and to the use of edifying;
and not only so, but when he was in company with strangers, nay, with
enemies that watched him, he took occasion to reprove what he saw amiss
in them, and to instruct them. Though the wicked were before him, he did
not keep silence from good (as David did, [Psa
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001.md), [Psa
39:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#002).md), for, notwithstanding the
provocation given him, he had not his heart hot within him, nor was his
spirit stirred. We must not only not allow any corrupt communication at
our tables, such as that of the hypocritical mockers at feasts, but we
must go beyond common harmless talk, and should take occasion from God's
goodness to us at our tables to speak well of him, and learn to
spiritualize common things. The lips of the righteous should then feed
many. Our Lord Jesus was among persons of quality, yet, as one that had
not respect of persons,

I. He takes occasion to reprove the guests for striving to sit
uppermost, and thence gives us a lesson of humility.

1\. He observed how these lawyers and Pharisees affected the highest
seats, towards the head-end of the table, [Luk
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#007.md). He had charged that sort of men
with this in general, [Luk 11:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#043.md). Here
he brings home the charge to particular persons; for Christ will give
every man his own. He marked how they chose out the chief rooms; every
man, as he came in, got as near the best seat as he could. Note, Even in
the common actions of life, Christ's eye is upon us, and he marks what
we do, not only in our religious assemblies, but at our tables, and
makes remarks upon it.

2\. He observed how those who were thus aspiring often exposed
themselves, and came off with a slur; whereas, those who were modest,
and seated themselves in the lowest seats, often gained respect by it.
(1.) Those who, when they come in, assume the highest seats, may perhaps
be degraded, and forced to come down to give place to one more
honourable, [Luk 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#008.md), [Luk
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#009.md). Note, It ought to check our high
thoughts of ourselves to think how many there are that are more
honourable than we, not only in respect of worldly dignities, but of
personal merits and accomplishments. Instead of being proud that so many
give place to us, it should be humbling to us that there are so many
that we must give place to. The master of the feast will marshal his
guests, and will not see the more honourable kept out of the seat that
is his due, and therefore will make bold to take him lower that usurped
it; Give this man place; and this will be a disgrace before all the
company to him that would be thought more deserving than he really was.
Note, Pride will have shame, and will at last have a fall. (2.) Those
who, when they come in, content themselves with the lowest seats, are
likely to be preferred ([Luk 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#010).md):
"Go, and seat thyself in the lowest room, as taking it for granted that
thy friend, who invited thee, has guests to come that are of better rank
and quality than thou are; but perhaps it may not prove so, and then it
will be said to thee, Friend, go up higher. The master of the feast will
be so just to thee as not to keep thee at the lower end of the table
because thou wert so modest as to seat thyself there." Note, The way to
rise high is to begin low, and this recommends a man to those about him:
"Thou shalt have honour and respect before those that sit with thee.
They will see thee to be an honourable man, beyond what at first they
thought; and honour appears the brighter for shining out of obscurity.
They will likewise see thee to be a humble man, which is the greatest
honour of all. Our Saviour here refers to that advice of Solomon ([Pro
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#006.md), [Pro
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#007).md), Stand not in the place of great
men, for better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither, than
that thou shouldest be put lower." And Dr. Lightfoot quotes a parable
out of one of the rabbin somewhat like this. "Three men," said he, "were
bidden to a feast; one sat highest, For, said he, I am a prince; the
other next, For, said he, I am a wise man; the other lowest, For, said
he, I am a humble man. The king seated the humble man highest, and put
the prince lowest."

3\. He applied this generally, and would have us all learn not to mind
high things, but to content ourselves with mean things, as for other
reasons, so for this, because pride and ambition are disgraceful before
men: for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; but humility and
self-denial are really honourable: he that humbleth himself shall be
exalted, [Luk 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#011.md). We see in other
instances that a man's pride will bring him low, but honour shall uphold
the humble in spirit, and before honour is humility.

II\. He takes occasion to reprove the master of the feast for inviting
so many rich people, who had wherewithal to dine very well at home, when
he should rather have invited the poor, or, which was all one, have sent
portions to them for whom nothing was prepared, and who could not afford
themselves a good meal's meat. See [Neh
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#010.md). Our Saviour here teaches us that
the using of what we have in works of charity is better, and will turn
to a better account, than using it in works of generosity and in
magnificent house-keeping.

1\. "Covet not to treat the rich; invite not thy friends, and brethren,
and neighbours, that are rich," [Luk
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#012.md). This does not prohibit the
entertaining of such; there may be occasion for it, for the cultivating
of friendship among relations and neighbours. But, (1.) "Do not make a
common custom of it; spend as little as thou canst that way, that thou
mayest not disable thyself to lay out in a much better way, in
almsgiving. Thou wilt find it very expensive and troublesome; one feast
for the rich will make a great many meals for the poor." Solomon saith,
He that giveth to the rich shall surely come to want, [Pro
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#016). "Give" (saith Pliny, Epist..md)
"to thy friends, but let it be to thy poor friends, not to those that
need thee not." (2.) "Be not proud of it." Many make feasts only to make
a show, as Ahasuerus did ([Est 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#003.md),
[Est 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#004).md), and it is no reputation to
them, they think, if they have not persons of quality to dine with them,
and thus rob their families, to please their fancies. (3.) "Aim not at
being paid again in your own coin." This is that which our Saviour
blames in making such entertainments: "You commonly do it in hopes that
you will be invited by them, and so a recompence will be made you; you
will be gratified with such dainties and varieties as you treat your
friends with, and this will feed your sensuality and luxury, and you
will be no real gainer at last."

2\. "Be forward to relieve the poor ([Luk
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#013.md), [Luk
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#014).md): When thou makest a feast,
instead of furnishing thyself with what is rare and nice, get thy table
spread with a competency of plain and wholesome meat, which will not be
so costly, and invite the poor and maimed, such as have nothing to live
upon, nor are able to work for their living. These are objects of
charity; they want necessaries; furnish them, and they will recompense
thee with their prayers; they will commend thy provisions, which the
rich, it may be, will despise. They will go away, and thank God for
thee, when the rich will go away and reproach thee. Say not that thou
art a loser, because they cannot recompense thee, thou art so much out
of pocket; no, it is so much set out to the best interest, on the best
security, for thou shall be recompensed at the resurrection of the
just." There will be a resurrection of the just, a future state of the
just. There is a state of happiness reserved for them in the other
world; and we may be sure that the charitable will be remembered in the
resurrection of the just, for alms are righteousness. Works of charity
perhaps may not be rewarded in this world, for the things of this world
are not the best things, and therefore God does not pay the best men in
those things; but they shall in no wise lose their reward; they shall be
recompensed in the resurrection. It will be found that the longest
voyages make the richest returns, and that the charitable will be no
losers, but unspeakable gainers, by having their recompense adjourned
till the resurrection.

[Luke 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 14:15</span></span>

Here is another discourse of our Saviour's, in which he spiritualizes
the feast he was invited to, which is another way of keeping up good
discourse in the midst of common actions.

I. The occasion of the discourse was given by one of the guests, who,
when Christ was giving rules about feasting, said to him, Blessed is he
that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God ([Luk
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#015).md), which, some tell us, was a
saying commonly used among the rabbin.

1\. But with what design does this man bring it in here? (1.) Perhaps
this man, observing that Christ reproved first the guests and then the
master of the house, fearing he should put the company out of humour,
started this, to divert the discourse to something else. Or, (2.)
Admiring the good rules of humility and charity which Christ had now
given, but despairing to see them lived up to in the present degenerate
state of things, he longs for the kingdom of God, when these and other
good laws shall prevail, and pronounces them blessed who shall have a
place in that kingdom. Or, (3.) Christ having mentioned the resurrection
of the just, as a recompence for acts of charity to the poor, he here
confirms what he said, "Yea, Lord, they that shall be recompensed in the
resurrection of the just, shall eat bread in the kingdom, and that is a
greater recompence than being reinvited to the table of the greatest man
on earth." Or, (4.) Observing Christ to be silent, after he had given
the foregoing lessons, he was willing to draw him in again to further
discourse, so wonderfully well-pleased was he with what he said; and he
knew nothing more likely to engage him than to mention the kingdom of
God. Note, Even those that are not of ability to carry on good discourse
themselves ought to put in a word now and then, to countenance it, and
help it forward.

2\. Now what this man said was a plain and acknowledged truth, and it
was quoted very appositely now that they were sitting at meat; for we
should take occasion from common things to think and speak of those
heavenly and spiritual things which in scripture are compared to them,
for that is one end of borrowing similitudes from them. And it will be
good for us, when we are receiving the gifts of God's providence, to
pass through them to the consideration of the gifts of his grace, those
better things. This thought will be very seasonable when we are
partaking of bodily refreshments: Blessed are they that shall eat bread
in the kingdom of God. (1.) In the kingdom of grace, in the kingdom of
the Messiah, which was expected now shortly to be set up. Christ
promised his disciples that they should eat and drink with him in his
kingdom. They that partake of the Lord's supper eat bread in the kingdom
of God. (2.) In the kingdom of glory, at the resurrection. The happiness
of heaven is an everlasting feast; blessed are they that shall sit down
at that table, whence they shall rise no more.

II\. The parable which our Lord Jesus put forth upon this occasion, [Luk
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#016.md), etc. Christ joins with the good
man in what he said: "It is very true, Blessed are they that shall
partake of the privileges of the Messiah's kingdom. But who are they
that shall enjoy that privilege? You Jews, who think to have the
monopoly of it, will generally reject it, and the Gentiles will be the
greatest sharers in it." This he shows by a parable, for, if he had
spoken it plainly, the Pharisees would not have borne it. Now in the
parable we may observe,

1\. The free grace and mercy of God, shining in the gospel of Christ; it
appears,

(1.) In the rich provision he has made for poor souls, for their
nourishment, refreshment, and entertainment ([Luk
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#016).md): A certain man made a great
supper. There is that in Christ and the grace of the gospel which will
be food and a feast for the soul of man that knows its own capacities,
for the soul of a sinner that knows its own necessities and miseries. It
is called a supper, because in those countries supper time was the chief
feasting time, when the business of the day was over. The manifestation
of gospel grace to the world was the evening of the world's day; and the
fruition of the fulness of that grace in heaven is reserved for the
evening of our day.

(2.) In gracious invitation given us to come and partake of this
provision. Here is, \[1.\] A general invitation given: He bade many.
Christ invited the whole nation and people of the Jews to partake of the
benefits of his gospel. There is provision enough for as many as come;
it was prophesied of as a feast for all people, [Isa
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006.md). Christ in the gospel, as he
keeps a good house, so he keeps an open house. \[2.\] A particular
memorandum given, when the supper time was at hand; the servant was sent
round to put them in mind of it: Come, for all things are now ready.
When the Spirit was poured out, and the gospel church planted, those who
before were invited were more closely pressed to come in presently: Now
all things are ready, the full discovery of the gospel mystery is now
made, all the ordinances of the gospel are now instituted, the society
of Christians is now incorporated, and, which crowns all, the Holy Ghost
is now given. This is the call now given to us: "All things are now
ready, now is the accepted time; it is now, and has not been long; it is
now, and will not be long; it is a season of grace that will be soon
over, and therefore come now; do not delay; accept the invitation;
believe yourselves welcome; eat, O friends; drink, yea drink abundantly,
O beloved."

2\. The cold entertainment which the grace of the gospel meets with. The
invited guests declined coming. They did not say flatly and plainly that
they would not come, but they all with one consent began to make excuse,
[Luk 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#018.md). One would have expected
that they should all with one consent have come to a good supper, when
they were so kindly invited to it: who would have refused such an
invitation? Yet, on the contrary, they all found out some pretence or
other to shift off their attendance. This bespeaks the general neglect
of the Jewish nation to close with Christ, and accept of the offers of
his grace, and the contempt they put upon the invitation. It also
intimates the backwardness there is in most people to close with the
gospel call. They cannot for shame avow their refusal, but they desire
to be excused: they all apo mias, some supply hōras, all straightway,
they could give an answer extempore, and needed not to study for it, had
not to seek for an excuse. Others supply gnōmēs, they were unanimous in
it; with one voice. (1.) Here were two that were purchasers, who were in
such haste to go and see their purchases that they could not find time
to go to this supper. One had purchased land; he had bought a piece of
ground, which was represented to him to be a good bargain, and he must
needs to and see whether it was so or no; and therefore I pray thee have
me excused. His heart was so much upon the enlarging of his estate that
he could neither be civil to his friend nor kind to himself. Note, Those
that have their hearts full of the world, and fond of laying house to
house and field to field, have their ears deaf to the gospel invitation.
But what a frivolous excuse was this! He might have deferred going to
see his piece of ground till the next day, and have found it in the same
place and plight it was now in, if he had so pleased. Another had
purchased stock for his land. "I have bought five yoke of oxen for the
plough, and I must just now go and prove them, must go and try whether
they be fit for my purpose; and therefore excuse me for this time." The
former intimates that inordinate complacency in the world, this the
inordinate care and concern about the world, which keep people from
Christ and his grace; both intimate a preference given to the body above
the soul, and to the things of time above those of eternity. Note, It is
very criminal, when we are called to any duty, to make excuses for our
neglect of it: it is a sign that there are convictions that it is duty,
but no inclination to it. These things here, that were the matter of the
excuses, were, \[1.\] Little things, and of small concern. It had better
become them to have said, "I am invited to eat bread in the kingdom of
God, and therefore must be excused from going to see the ground or the
oxen." \[2.\] Lawful things. Note, Things lawful in themselves, when the
heart is too much set upon them, prove fatal hindrances in religion -
Licitus perimus omnes. It is a hard matter so to manage our worldly
affairs that they may not divert us from spiritual pursuits; and this
ought to be our great care. (2.) Here was one that was newly married,
and could not leave his wife to go out to supper, no, not for once ([Luk
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#030).md): I have married a wife, and
therefore, in short, I cannot come. He pretends that he cannot, when the
truth is he will not. Thus many pretend inability for the duties of
religion when really they have an aversion to them. He has married a
wife. It is true, he that married was excused by the law from going to
war for the first year ([Deu 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#005).md),
but would that excuse him from going up to the feasts of the Lord, which
all the males were yearly to attend? Much less will it excuse from the
gospel feast, of which the other were but types. Note, Our affection to
our relations often proves a hindrance to us in our duty to God. Adam's
excuse was, The woman that thou gavest me persuaded me to eat; this here
was, The woman persuaded me not to eat. He might have gone and taken his
wife along with him; they would both have been welcome.

3\. The account which was brought to the master of the feast of the
affront put upon him by his friends whom he had invited, who now showed
how little they valued him ([Luk
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#021).md): That servant came, and showed
his lord these things, told him with surprise that he was likely to sup
alone, for the guests that were invited, though they had had timely
notice a good while before, that they might order their affairs
accordingly, yet were now engaged in some other business. He made the
matter neither better nor worse, but related it just as it was. Note,
Ministers must give account of the success of their ministry. They must
do it now at the throne of grace. If they see of the travail of their
soul, they must go to God with their thanks; if they labour in vain,
they must go to God with their complaints. They will do it hereafter at
the judgment-seat of Christ: they shall be produced as witnesses against
those who persist and perish in their unbelief, to prove that they were
fairly invited; and for those who accepted the call, Behold, I and the
children thou hast given me. The apostle urges this as a reason why
people should give ear to the word of God sent them by his ministers;
for they watch for your souls, as those that must give account, [Heb
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017.md).

4\. The master's just resentment of this affront: He was angry, [Luk
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#021.md). Note, The ingratitude of those
that slight gospel offers, and the contempt they put upon the God of
heaven thereby, are a very great provocation to him, and justly so.
Abused mercy turns into the greatest wrath. The doom he passed upon them
was, None of the men that were bidden shall taste of my supper. This was
like the doom passed upon the ungrateful Israel, when they despised the
pleasant land: God swore in his wrath that they should not enter into
his rest. Note, Grace despised is grace forfeited, like Esau's
birthright. They that will not have Christ when they may shall not have
him when they would. Even those that were bidden, if they slight the
invitation, shall be forbidden; when the door is shut, the foolish
virgins will be denied entrance.

5\. The care that was taken to furnish the table with guests, as well as
meat. "Go" (saith he to the servants), "go first into the streets and
lanes of the city, and invite, not the merchants that are going from the
custom-house, nor the tradesmen that are shutting up their shops; they
will desire to be excused (one is going to his counting-house to cast up
his books, another to the tavern to drink a bottle with his friend);
but, that you may invite those that will be glad to come, bring in
hither the poor and the maimed, the halt and the blind; pick up the
common beggars." The servants object not that it will be a disparagement
to the master and his house to have such guests at his table; for they
know his mind, and they soon gather an abundance of such guests: Lord,
it is done as thou hast commanded. Many of the Jews are brought in, not
of the scribes and Pharisees, such as Christ was now at dinner with, who
thought themselves most likely to be guests at the Messiah's table, but
the publicans and sinners; these are the poor and the maimed. But yet
there is room for more guests, and provision enough for them all. "Go,
then, secondly, into the highways and hedges. Go out into the country,
and pick up the vagrants, or those that are returning now in the evening
from their work in the field, from hedging and ditching there, and
compel them to come in, not by force of arms, but by force of arguments.
Be earnest with them; for in this case it will be necessary to convince
them that the invitation is sincere and not a banter; they will be shy
and modest, and will hardly believe that they shall be welcome, and
therefore be importunate with them and do not leave them till you have
prevailed with them." This refers to the calling of the Gentiles, to
whom the apostles were to turn when the Jews refused the offer, and with
them the church was filled. Now observe here, (1.) The provision made
for precious souls in the gospel of Christ shall appear not to have been
made in vain; for, if some reject it, yet others will thankfully accept
the offer of it. Christ comforts himself with this, that, though Israel
be not gathered, yet he shall be glorious, as a light to the Gentiles,
[Isa 49:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#005.md), [Isa
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006.md). God will have a church in the
world, though there are those that are unchurched; for the unbelief of
man shall not make the promise of God of no effect. (2.) Those that are
very poor and low in the world shall be as welcome to Christ as the rich
and great; nay, and many times the gospel has greatest success among
those that labour under worldly disadvantages, as the poor, and bodily
infirmities, as the maimed, and the halt, and the blind. Christ here
plainly refers to what he had said just before, in direction to us, to
invite to our tables the poor and maimed, the lame and blind, [Luk
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#013.md). For consideration for the
countenance which Christ's gospel gives to the poor should engage us to
be charitable to them. His condescensions and compassions towards them
should engage ours. (3.) Many times the gospel has the greatest success
among those that are least likely to have the benefit of it, and whose
submission to it was least expected. The publicans and harlots went into
the kingdom of God before the scribes and Pharisees; so the last shall
be first, and the first last. Let us not be confident concerning those
that are most forward, nor despair of those that are least promising.
(4.) Christ's ministers must be both very expeditious and very
importunate in inviting to the gospel feast: "Go out quickly ([Luk
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#021).md); lose not time, because all
things are now ready. Call to them to come today, while it is called
today; and compel them to come in, by accosting them kindly, and drawing
them with the cords of a man and the bands of love." Nothing can be more
absurd than fetching an argument hence for compelling men's consciences,
nay, for compelling men against their consciences, in matters of
religion: "You shall receive the Lord's supper, or you shall be fined
and imprisoned, and ruined in your estate." Certainly nothing like this
was the compulsion here meant, but only that of reason and love; for the
weapons of our warfare are not carnal. (5.) Though many have been
brought in to partake of the benefits of the gospel, yet still there is
room for more; for the riches of Christ are unsearchable and
inexhaustible; there is in him enough for all, and enough for each; and
the gospel excludes none that do not exclude themselves. (6.) Christ's
house, though it be large, shall at last be filled; it will be so when
the number of the elect is completed, and as many as were given him are
brought to him.

[Luke 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 14:25</span></span>

See how Christ in his doctrine suited himself to those to whom he spoke,
and gave every one his portion of meat. To Pharisees he preached
humility and charity. He is in these verses directing his discourse to
the multitudes that crowded after him, and seemed zealous in following
him; and his exhortation to them is to understand the terms of
discipleship, before they undertook the profession of it, and to
consider what they did. See here,

I. How zealous people were in their attendance on Christ ([Luk
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#025).md): There went great multitudes
with him, many for love and more for company, for where there are many
there will be more. Here was a mixed multitude, like that which went
with Israel out of Egypt; such we must expect there will always be in
the church, and it will therefore be necessary that ministers should
carefully separate between the precious and the vile.

II\. How considerate he would have them to be in their zeal. Those that
undertake to follow Christ must count upon the worst, and prepare
accordingly.

1\. He tells them what the worst is that they must count upon, much the
same with what he had gone through before them and for them. He takes it
for granted that they had a mind to be his disciples, that they might be
qualified for preferment in his kingdom. They expected that he should
say, "If any man come to me, and be my disciple, he shall have wealth
and honour in abundance; let me alone to make him a great man." But he
tells them quite the contrary.

(1.) They must be willing to quit that which was very dear, and
therefore must come to him thoroughly weaned from all their
creature-comforts, and dead to them, so as cheerfully to part with them
rather than quit their interest in Christ, [Luk
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026.md). A man cannot be Christ's
disciple but he must hate father, and mother, and his own life. He is
not sincere, he will be constant and persevering, unless he love Christ
better than any thing in this world, and be willing to part with that
which he may and must leave, either as a sacrifice, when Christ may be
glorified by our parting with it (so the martyrs, who loved not their
lives to death), or as a temptation, when by our parting with it we are
put into a better capacity of serving Christ. Thus Abraham parted with
his own country, and Moses with Pharaoh's court. Mention is not made
here of houses and lands; philosophy will teach a man to look upon these
with contempt; but Christianity carries it higher. \[1.\] Every good man
loves his relations; and yet, if he be a disciple of Christ, he must
comparatively hate them, must love them less than Christ, as Leah is
said to be hated when Rachel was better loved. Not that their persons
must be in any degree hated, but our comfort and satisfaction in them
must be lost and swallowed up in our love to Christ, as Levi's was, when
he said to his father, I have not seen him, [Deu
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#009.md). When our duty to our parents
comes in competition with our evident duty to Christ, we must give
Christ the preference. If we must either deny Christ or be banished from
our families and relations (as many of the primitive Christians were),
we must rather lose their society than his favour. \[2.\] Every man
loves his own life, no man ever yet hated it; and we cannot be Christ's
disciples if we do not love him better than our own lives, so as rather
to have our lives embittered by cruel bondage, nay, and taken away by
cruel deaths, than to dishonour Christ, or depart from any of his truths
and ways. The experience of the pleasures of the spiritual life, and the
believing hopes and prospects of eternal life, will make this hard
saying easy. When tribulation and persecution arise because of the word,
then chiefly the trial is, whether we love better, Christ or our
relations and lives; yet even in the days of peace this matter is
sometimes brought to the trial. Those that decline the service of
Christ, and opportunities of converse with him, and are ashamed to
confess him, for fear of disobliging a relation or friend, or losing a
customer, give cause to suspect that they love him better than Christ.

(2.) That they must be willing to bear that which was very heavy ([Luk
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#027).md): Whosoever doth not bear his
cross, as those did that were condemned to be crucified, in submission
to the sentence and in expectation of the execution of it, and so come
after me whithersoever I shall lead him, he cannot be my disciple; that
is (says Dr. Hammond), he is not for my turn; and my service, being so
sure to bring persecution along with it, will not be for his. Though the
disciples of Christ are not all crucified, yet they all bear their
cross, as if they counted upon being crucified. They must be content to
be put into an ill name, and to be loaded with infamy and disgrace; for
no name is more ignominious than Furcifer - the bearer of the gibbet. He
must bear his cross, and come after Christ; that is, he must bear it in
the way of his duty, whenever it lies in that way. He must bear it when
Christ calls him to it, and in bearing it he must have an eye to Christ,
and fetch encouragements from him, and live in hope of a recompence with
him.

2\. He bids them count upon it, and then consider of it. Since he has
been so just to us as to tell us plainly what difficulties we shall meet
with in following him, let us be so just to ourselves as to weigh the
matter seriously before we take upon us a profession of religion. Joshua
obliged the people to consider what they did when they promised to serve
the Lord, [Jos 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#019.md). It is better
never to begin than not to proceed; and therefore before we begin we
must consider what it is to proceed. This is to act rationally, and as
becomes men, and as we do in other cases. The cause of Christ will bear
a scrutiny. Satan shows the best, but hides the worst, because his best
will not counter-vail his worst; but Christ's will abundantly. This
considering of the case is necessary to perseverance, especially in
suffering times. Our Saviour here illustrates the necessity of it by two
similitudes, the former showing that we must consider the expenses of
our religion, the latter that we must consider the perils of it.

(1.) When we take upon us a profession of religion we are like a man
that undertakes to build a tower, and therefore must consider the
expense of it ([Luk 14:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#028).md): Which
of you, intending to build a tower or stately house for himself, sitteth
not down first, and counteth the cost? and he must be sure to count upon
a great deal more than his workmen will tell him it will cost. Let him
compare the charge with his purse, lest he make himself to be laughed
at, by beginning to build what he is not able to finish. Note, \[1.\]
All that take upon them a profession of religion undertake to build a
tower, not as the tower of Babel, in opposition to Heaven, which
therefore was left unfinished, but in obedience to Heaven, which
therefore shall have its top-stone brought forth. Begin low, and lay the
foundation deep, lay it on the rock, and make sure work, and then aim as
high as heaven. \[2.\] Those that intend to build this tower must sit
down and count the cost. Let them consider that it will cost them the
mortifying of their sins, even the most beloved lusts; it will cost them
a life of self-denial and watchfulness, and a constant course of holy
duties; it may, perhaps, cost them their reputation among men, their
estates and liberties, and all that is dear to them in this world, even
life itself. And if it should cost us all this, what is it in comparison
with what it cost Christ to purchase the advantages of religion for us,
which come to us without money and without price? \[3.\] Many that begin
to build this tower do not go on with it, nor persevere in it, and it is
their folly; they have not courage and resolution, have not a rooted
fixed principle, and so bring nothing to pass. It is true, we have none
of us in ourselves sufficient to finish this tower, but Christ hath
said, My grace is sufficient for thee, and that grace shall not be
wanting to any of us, if we seek for it and make use of it. \[4.\]
Nothing is more shameful than for those that have begun well in religion
to break off; every one will justly mock him, as having lost all his
labour hitherto for want of perseverance. We lose the things we have
wrought ([Jo2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#008).md), and all we have
done and suffered is in vain, [Gal
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#004.md).

(2.) When we undertake to be Christ's disciples we are like a man that
goes to war, and therefore must consider the hazard of it, and the
difficulties that are to be encountered, [Luk
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#031.md), [Luk
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#032.md). A king that declares war
against a neighbouring prince considers whether he has strength
wherewith to make his part good, and, if not, he will lay aside his
thoughts of war. Note, \[1.\] The state of a Christian in this world is
a military state. Is not the Christian life a warfare? We have many
passes in our way, that must be disputed with dint of sword; nay, we
must fight every step we go, so restless are our spiritual enemies in
their opposition. \[2.\] We ought to consider whether we can endure the
hardness which a good soldier of Jesus Christ must expect and count
upon, before we enlist ourselves under Christ's banner; whether we are
able to encounter the forces of hell and earth, which come against us
twenty thousand strong. \[3.\] Of the two it is better to make the best
terms we can with the world than pretend to renounce it and afterwards,
when tribulation and persecution arise because of the word, to return to
it. That young man that could not find in his heart to part with his
possessions for Christ did better to go away from Christ sorrowing than
to have staid with him dissembling.

This parable is another way applicable, and may be taken as designed to
teach us to begin speedily to be religious, rather than to begin
cautiously; and may mean the same with [Mat
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#025.md), Agree with thine adversary
quickly. Note, First, Those that persist in sin make war against God,
the most unnatural, unjustifiable war; they rebel against their lawful
sovereign, whose government is perfectly just and good. Secondly, The
proudest and most daring sinner is no equal match for God; the
disproportion of strength is much greater than that here supposed
between ten thousand and twenty thousand. Do we provoke the Lord to
jealousy? Are we stronger than he? No, surely; who knows the power of
his anger? In consideration of this, it is our interest to make peace
with him. We need not send to desire conditions of peace; they are
offered to us, and are unexceptionable, and highly to our advantage. Let
us acquaint ourselves with them, and be at peace; do this in time, while
the other is yet a great way off; for delays in such a case are highly
dangerous, and make after-applications difficult.

But the application of this parable here ([Luk
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#033).md) is to the consideration that
ought to be exercised when we take upon us a profession of religion.
Solomon saith, With good advice make war ([Pro
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#018).md); for he that draws the sword
throws away the scabbard; so with good advice enter upon a profession of
religion, as those that know that except you forsake all you have you
cannot be Christ's disciples; that is, except you count upon forsaking
all and consent to it, for all that will live godly in Christ Jesus must
suffer persecution, and yet continue to live godly.

3\. He warns them against apostasy and a degeneracy of mind from the
truly Christian spirit and temper, for that would make them utterly
useless, [Luk 14:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#034.md), [Luk
14:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#035). (1..md) Good Christians are the
salt of the earth, and good ministers especially ([Mat
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013).md); and this salt is good and of
great use; by their instructions and examples they season all they
converse with, to keep them from putrefying, and to quicken them, and
make them savoury. (2.) Degenerate Christians, who, rather than part
with what they have in the world, will throw up their profession, and
then of course become carnal, and worldly, and wholly destitute of a
Christian spirit, are like salt that has lost its savour, like that
which the chemists call the caput mortuum, that has all its salts drawn
from it, that is the most useless worthless thing in the world; it has
no manner of virtue or good property in it. \[1.\] It can never be
recovered: Wherewith shall it be seasoned? You cannot salt it. This
intimates that it is extremely difficult, and next to impossible, to
recover an apostate, [Heb 6:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004.md). If
Christianity will not prevail to cure men of their worldliness and
sensuality, if that remedy has been tried in vain, their ease must even
be concluded desperate. \[2.\] It is of no use. It is not fit, as dung
is, for the land, to manure that, nor will it be the better if it be
laid in the dunghill to rot; there is nothing to be got out of it. A
professor of religion whose mind and manners are depraved is the most
insipid animal that can be. If he speaks of the things of God, of which
he has had some knowledge, it is so awkwardly that none are the better
for it: it is a parable in the mouth of a fool. \[3.\] It is abandoned:
Men cast it out, as that which they will have no more to do with. Such
scandalous professors ought to be cast out of the church, not only
because they have forfeited all the honours and privileges of their
church-membership, but because there is danger that others will be
infected by them. Our Saviour concludes this with a call to all to take
notice of it, and to take warning: He that hath ears to hear, let him
hear. Now can the faculty of hearing be better employed than in
attending to the word of Christ, and particularly to the alarms he has
given us of the danger we are in of apostasy, and the danger we run
ourselves into by apostasy?
