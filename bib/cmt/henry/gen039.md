### [Genesis Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 39:0</span></span>

At this chapter we return to the story of Joseph. We have him here, I. A
servant, a slave in Potiphar's house ([Gen
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#001).md), and yet there greatly honoured
and favoured, I. By the providence of God, which made him, in effect, a
master ([Gen 39:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#002).md). 2. By the grace
of God, which made him more than a conqueror over a strong temptation to
uncleanness ([Gen 39:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#007).md). II. We
have him here a sufferer, falsely accused ([Gen
39:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#013).md), imprisoned ([Gen
39:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#019.md), [Gen
39:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#020).md), and yet his imprisonment made
both honourable and comfortable by the tokens of God's special presence
with him ([Gen 39:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#021).md). And herein
Joseph was a type of Christ, "who took upon him the form of a servant,"
and yet then did that which made it evident that "God was with him," who
was tempted by Satan, but overcame the temptation, who was falsely
accused and bound, and yet had all things committed to his hand.

[Genesis 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 39:1</span></span>

Here is, I. Joseph bought ([Gen 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#001).md),
and he that bought him, whatever he gave for him, had a good bargain of
him; it was better than the merchandise of silver. The Jews have a
proverb, "If the world did not know the worth of good men, they would
hedge them about with pearls." He was sold to an officer of Pharaoh,
with whom he might get acquainted with public persons and public
business, and so be fitted for the preferment for which he was designed.
Note, 1. What God intends men for he will be sure, some way or other, to
qualify them for. 2. Providence is to be acknowledged in the disposal
even of poor servants and in their settlements, and therein may perhaps
be working towards something great and important.

II\. Joseph blessed, wonderfully blessed, even in the house of his
servitude.

1\. God prospered him, [Gen 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#002.md), [Gen
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#003.md). Perhaps the affairs of
Potiphar's family had remarkably gone backward before; but, upon
Joseph's coming into it, a discernible turn was given to them, and the
face and posture of them altered on a sudden. Though, at first, we may
suppose that his hand was put to the meanest services, even in those
appeared his ingenuity and industry; a particular blessing of Heaven
attended him, which, as he rose in his employment, became more and more
discernible. Note, (1.) Those that have wisdom and grace have that which
cannot be taken away from them, whatever else they are robbed of.
Joseph's brethren had stripped him of his coat of many colours, but they
could not strip him of his virtue and prudence. (2.) Those that can
separate us from all our friends, yet cannot deprive us of the gracious
presence of our God. When Joseph had none of all his relations with him,
he had his God with him, even in the house of the Egyptian. Joseph was
separated from his brethren, but not from his God; banished from his
father's house, but the Lord was with him, and this comforted him. (3.)
It is God's presence with us that makes all we do prosperous. Those that
would prosper must therefore make God their friend; and those that do
prosper must therefore give God the praise.

2\. His master preferred him, by degrees made him steward of his
household, [Gen 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#004). Note, (1..md)
Industry and honesty are the surest and safest way both of rising and
thriving: Seest thou a man prudent, and faithful, and diligent in his
business? He shall stand before kings at length, and not always before
mean men. (2.) It is the wisdom of those that are in any sort of
authority to countenance and employ those with whom it appears that the
presence of God is, [Psa 101:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#006.md).
Potiphar knew what he did when he put all into the hands of Joseph; for
he knew it would prosper better there than in his own hand. (3.) He that
is faithful in a few things stand fair for being made ruler over many
things, [Mat 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#021.md). Christ goes by
this rule with his servants. (4.) It is a great ease to a master to have
those employed under him that are trusty. Potiphar was so well satisfied
with Joseph's conduct that he knew not aught he had, save the bread
which he did eat, [Gen 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#006.md). The
servant had all the care and trouble of the estate; the master had only
the enjoyment of it: an example not to be imitated by any master, unless
he could be sure that he had one in all respects like Joseph for a
servant.

3\. God favoured his master for his sake ([Gen
39:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#005).md): He blessed the Egyptian's
house, though he was an Egyptian, a stranger to the true God, for
Joseph's sake; and he himself, like Laban, soon learned it by
experience, [Gen 30:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#027). Note, (1..md)
Good men are the blessings of the places where they live; even good
servants may be so, though mean, and lightly esteemed. (2.) The
prosperity of the wicked is, one way or other, for the sake of the
godly. Here was a wicked family blessed for the sake of one good servant
in it.

[Genesis 39:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 39:7</span></span>

Here is, I. A most shameful instance of impudence and immodesty in
Joseph's mistress, the shame and scandal of her sex, perfectly lost to
all virtue and honour, and not to be mentioned, nor thought of, without
the utmost indignation. It was well that she was an Egyptian; for we
must have shared in the confusion if such folly had been found in
Israel. Observe,

I. Her sin began in the eye: She cast her eyes upon Joseph ([Gen
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#007).md), who was a goodly person, and
well-favoured, [Gen 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#006). Note, (1..md)
Remarkable beauty, either of men or women, often proves a dangerous
snare both to themselves and others, which forbids pride in it and
commands constant watchfulness against the temptation that attends it;
favour is deceitful - deceiving. (2.) We have great need to make a
covenant with our eyes ([Job 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#001).md),
lest the eye infect the heart. Joseph's mistress had a husband that
ought to have been to her for a covering of the eyes from all others,
[Gen 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#016.md).

2\. She was daring and shameless in the sin. With an impudent face, and
a harlot's forehead, she said, Lie with me, having already, by her
wanton looks and unchaste desires, committed adultery with him in her
heart. Note, Where the unclean spirit gets possession and dominion in a
soul, it is as with the possessed of the devils ([Luk
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#027.md), [Luk
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#029).md), the clothes of modesty are
thrown off and the bands and fetters of shame are broken in pieces. When
lust has got head, it will stick at nothing, blush at nothing; decency,
and reputation, and conscience, are all sacrificed to that Baal-peor. 3.
She was urgent and violent in the temptation. Often she had been denied
with the strongest reasons, and yet as often renewed her vile
solicitations. She spoke to him day by day, [Gen
39:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#010). Now this was, (1..md) Great
wickedness in her, and showed her heart fully set to do evil. (2.) A
great temptation to Joseph. The hand of Satan, no doubt, was in it, who,
when he found he could not overcome him with troubles and the frowns of
the world (for in them he still held fast his integrity), assaulted him
with soft and charming pleasures, which have ruined more than the
former, and have slain their ten-thousands.

II\. Here is a most illustrious instance of virtue and resolved chastity
in Joseph, who, by the grace of God, was enabled to resist and overcome
this temptation; and, all things considered, his escape was, for aught I
know, as great an instance of the divine power as the deliverance of the
three children out of the fiery furnace.

1\. The temptation he was assaulted with was very strong. Never was a
more violent onset made upon the fort of chastity than this recorded
here. (1.) The sin he was tempted to was uncleanness, which considering
his youth, his beauty, his single state, and his plentiful living at the
table of a ruler, was a sin which, one would think, might most easily
beset him and betray him. (2.) The tempter was his mistress, a person of
quality, whom it was his place to obey and his interest to oblige, whose
favour would contribute more than any thing to his preferment, and by
whose means he might arrive at the highest honours of the court. On the
other hand, it was at his utmost peril if he slighted her, and made her
his enemy. (3.) Opportunity makes a thief, makes an adulterer, and that
favoured the temptation. The tempter was in the house with him; his
business led him to be, without any suspicion, where she was; none of
the family were within ([Gen 39:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#011).md);
there appeared no danger of its being ever discovered, or, if it should
be suspected, his mistress would protect him. (4.) To all this was added
importunity, frequent constant importunity, to such a degree that, at
last, she laid violent hands on him.

2\. His resistance of the temptation was very brave, and the victory
truly honourable. The almighty grace of God enabled him to overcome this
assault of the enemy,

(1.) By strength of reason; and wherever right reason may be heard,
religion no doubt will carry the day. He argues from the respect he owed
both to God and his master, [Gen 39:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#008.md),
[Gen 39:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#009.md). \[1.\] He would not wrong
his master, nor do such an irreparable injury to his honour. He
considers, and urges, how kind his master had been to him, what a
confidence he had reposed in him, in how many instances he had
befriended him, for which he abhorred the thought of making such an
ungrateful return. Note, We are bound in honour, as well as justice and
gratitude, not in any thing to injure those that have a good opinion of
us and place a trust in us, how secretly soever it may be done. See how
he argues ([Gen 39:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#009).md): "There is none
greater in this house than I, therefore I will not do it." Note, Those
that are great, instead of being proud of their greatness, should use it
as an argument against sin. "Is none greater than I? Then I will scorn
to do a wicked thing; it is below me to serve a base lust; I will not
disparage myself so much." \[2.\] He would not offend his God. This is
the chief argument with which he strengthens his aversion to the sin.
How can I do this? not only, How shall I? or, How dare I? but, How can
I? Id possumus, quod jure possumus - We can do that which we can do
lawfully. It is good to shut out sin with the strongest bar, even that
of an impossibility. He that is born of God cannot sin, [Jo1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#009.md). Three arguments Joseph urges upon
himself. First, He considers who he was that was tempted. "I; others may
perhaps take their liberty, but I cannot. I that am an Israelite in
covenant with God, that profess religion, and relation to him: it is
next to impossible for me to do so." Secondly, What the sin was to which
he was tempted: This great wickedness. Others might look upon it as a
small matter, a peccadillo, a trick of youth; but Joseph had another
idea of it. In general, when at any time we are tempted to sin, we must
consider the great wickedness there is in it, let sin appear sin ([Rom
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#013).md), call it by its own name, and
never go about to lessen it. Particularly let the sin of uncleanness
always be looked upon as great wickedness, as an exceedingly sinful sin,
that wars against the soul as much as any other. Thirdly, Against whom
he was tempted to sin - against God; not only, "How shall I do it, and
sin against my master, my mistress, myself, my own body and soul; but
against God?" Note, Gracious souls look upon this as the worst thing in
sin that it is against God, against his nature and his dominion, against
his love and his design. Those that love God do for this reason hate
sin.

(2.) By stedfastness of resolution. The grace of God enabled him to
overcome the temptation by avoiding the tempter. \[1.\] He hearkened not
to her, so much as to be with her, [Gen
39:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#010.md). Note, Those that would be kept
from harm must keep themselves out of harm's way. Avoid it, pass not by
it. Nay, \[2.\] When she laid hold of him, he left his garment in her
hand, [Gen 39:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#012.md). He would not stay so
much as to parley with the temptation, but flew out from it with the
utmost abhorrence; he left his garment, as one escaping for his life.
Note, It is better to lose a good coat than a good conscience.

[Genesis 39:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 39:13</span></span>

Joseph's mistress, having tried in vain to make him a criminal, now
endeavours to represent him as one; so to be revenged on him for his
virtue. Now was her love turned into the utmost rage and malice, and she
pretends she cannot endure the sight of him whom awhile ago she could
not endure out of her sight. Chaste and holy love will continue, though
slighted; but sinful love, like Amnon's to Tamar, is easily changed into
sinful hatred. 1. She accused him to his fellow servants ([Gen
39:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#013).md) and gave him a bad name
among them. Probably they envied him his interest in their master's
favour, and his authority in the house; and perhaps found themselves
aggrieved sometimes by his fidelity, which prevented their purloining;
and therefore they were glad to hear any thing that might tend to his
disgrace, and, if there was room for it, incensed their mistress yet
more against him. Observe, When she speaks of her husband, she does not
call him her husband, or her lord, but only he; for she had forgotten
the covenant of her God, that was between them. Thus the adulteress
([Pro 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#019).md) calls her husband the good
man. Note, Innocence itself cannot secure a man's reputation. Not every
one that keeps a good conscience can keep a good name. 2. She accused
him to his master, who had power in his hand to punish him, which his
fellow servants had not, [Gen 39:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#017.md),
[Gen 39:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#018). Observe, (1..md) What an
improbable story she tells, producing his garment as an evidence that he
had offered violence to her, which was a plain indication that she had
offered violence to him. Note, Those that have broken the bonds of
modesty will never be held by the bonds of truth. No marvel that she who
had impudence enough to say, Lie with me, had front enough to say, "He
would have lien with me." Had the lie been told to conceal her own crime
it would have been bad enough, yet, in some degree, excusable; but it
was told to be revenged upon his virtue, a most malicious lie. And yet,
(2.) She manages it so as to incense her husband against him, reflecting
upon him for bringing this Hebrew servant among them, perhaps at first
against her mind, because he was a Hebrew. Note, It is no new thing for
the best of men to be falsely accused of the worst of crimes by those
who themselves are the worst of criminals. As this matter was
represented, one would have thought chaste Joseph a very bad man and his
wanton mistress a virtuous woman; it is well that there is a day of
discovery coming, in which all shall appear in their true characters.
This was not the first time that Joseph's coat was made use of as a
false witness concerning him; his father had been deceived by it before,
now his master.

[Genesis 39:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 39:19</span></span>

Here is, 1. Joseph wronged by his master. He believed the accusation,
and either Joseph durst not make his defence by telling the truth, as it
would reflect too much upon his mistress, or his master would not hear
it, or would not believe it, and there is no remedy, he is condemned to
perpetual imprisonment, [Gen 39:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#019.md),
[Gen 39:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#020.md). God restrained his wrath,
else he had put him to death; and that wrath which imprisoned him God
made to turn to his praise, in order to which Providence so disposed
that he should be shut up among the king's prisoners, the
state-prisoners. Potiphar, it is likely, chose that prison because it
was the worst; for there the iron entered into the soul ([Psa
105:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#018).md), but God designed to pave the
way to his enlargement. He was committed to the king's prison, that he
might thence be preferred to the king's person. Note, Many an action of
false imprisonment will, in the great day, be found to lie against the
enemies and persecutors of God's people. Our Lord Jesus, like Joseph
here, was bound, and numbered with the transgressors. 2. Joseph owned
and righted by his God, who is, and will be, the just and powerful
patron of oppressed innocence. Joseph was at a distance from all his
friends and relations, had not them with him to comfort him, or to
minister to him, or to mediate for him; but the Lord was with Joseph,
and showed him mercy, [Gen 39:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#021.md).
Note, (1.) God despises not his prisoners, [Psa
69:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#033.md). No gates nor bars can shut out
his gracious presence from his people; for he has promised that he will
never leave them. (2.) Those that have a good conscience in a prison
have a good God there. Integrity and uprightness qualify us for the
divine favour, wherever we are. Joseph is not long a prisoner before he
becomes a little ruler even in the prison, which is to be attributed,
under God, \[1.\] To the keeper's favour. God gave him favour in the
sight of the keeper of the prison. Note, God can raise up friends for
his people even where they little expect to find them, and can make them
to be pitied even of those that carry them captive, [Psa
106:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#046.md). \[2.\] To Joseph's fitness for
business. The keeper saw that God was with him, and that every thing
prospered under his hand; and therefore entrusted him with the
management of the affairs of the prison, [Gen
39:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#022.md), [Gen
39:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#023.md). Note, Wisdom and virtue will
shine in the narrowest spheres. A good man will do good wherever he is,
and will be a blessing even in bonds and banishment; for the Spirit of
the Lord is not bound nor banished, witness St. Paul, [Phi
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#012.md), [Phi
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#013.md).
