### [Numbers Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 33:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have, I. A particular account of the removals and
encampments of the children of Israel, from their escape out of Egypt to
their entrance into Canaan, forty-two in all, with some remarkable
events that happened at some of those places (v. 1-49). II. A strict
command given them to drive out all the inhabitants of the land of
Canaan, which they were not going to conquer and take possession of
([Num 33:50-56](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#050).md). So that the former
part of the chapter looks back upon their march through the wilderness,
the latter looks forward to their settlement in Canaan.

[Numbers 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 33:1</span></span>

This is a review and brief rehearsal of the travels of the children of
Israel through the wilderness. It was a memorable history and well
worthy to be thus abridged, and the abridgment thus preserved, to the
honour of God that led them and for the encouragement of the generations
that followed. Observe here,

I. How the account was kept: Moses wrote their goings out, [Num
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#002.md). When they began this tedious
march, God ordered him to keep a journal or diary, and to insert in it
all the remarkable occurrences of their way, that it might be a
satisfaction to himself in the review and an instruction to others when
it should be published. It may be of good use to private Christians, but
especially to those in public stations, to preserve in writing an
account of the providences of God concerning them, the constant series
of mercies they have experienced, especially those turns and changes
which have made some days of their lives more remarkable. Our memories
are deceitful and need this help, that we may remember all the way which
the Lord our God has led us in this wilderness, [Deu
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#002.md).

II\. What the account itself was. It began with their departure out of
Egypt, continued with their march through the wilderness, and ended in
the plains of Moab, where they now lay encamped.

1\. Some things are observed here concerning their departure out of
Egypt, which they are reminded of upon all occasions, as a work of
wonder never to be forgotten. (1.) That they went forth with their
armies ([Num 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#001).md), rank and file, as
an army with banners. (2.) Under the hand of Moses and Aaron, their
guides, overseers, and rulers, under God. (3.) With a high hand, because
God's hand was high that wrought for them, and in the sight of all the
Egyptians, [Num 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#003.md). They did not
steal away clandestinely ([Isa 52:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#012).md),
but in defiance of their enemies, to whom God had made them such a
burdensome stone that they neither could, nor would, nor durst, oppose
them. (4.) They went forth while the Egyptians were burying, or at least
preparing to bury, their first-born, [Num
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#004.md). They had a mind good enough, or
rather bad enough, still to have detained the Israelites their
prisoners, but God found them other work to do. They would have God's
first-born buried alive, but God set them a burying their own
first-born. (5.) To all the plagues of Egypt it is added here that on
their gods also the Lord executed judgments. Their idols which they
worshipped, it is probable, were broken down, as Dagon afterwards before
the ark, so that they could not consult them about this great affair. To
this perhaps there is reference, [Isa
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001.md), The idols of Egypt shall be
moved at his presence.

2\. Concerning their travels towards Canaan. Observe, (1.) They were
continually upon the remove. When they had pitched a little while in one
place they departed from that to another. Such is our state in this
world; we have here no continuing city. (2.) Most of their way lay
through a wilderness, uninhabited, untracked, unfurnished even with the
necessaries of human life, which magnifies the wisdom and power of God,
by whose wonderful conduct and bounty the thousands of Israel not only
subsisted for forty years in that desolate place, but came out at least
as numerous and vigorous as they went in. At first they pitched in the
edge of the wilderness ([Num 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#006).md),
but afterwards in the heart of it; by less difficulties God prepares his
people for greater. We find them in the wilderness of Etham ([Num
33:8](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#008).md), of Sin ([Num
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#011).md), of Sinai, [Num
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#015.md). Our removals in this world are
but from one wilderness to another. (3.) They were led to and fro,
forward and backward, as in a maze or labyrinth, and yet were all the
while under the direction of the pillar of cloud and fire. He led them
about ([Deu 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#010).md), and yet led them
the right way, [Psa 107:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#007.md). The way
which God takes in bringing his people to himself is always the best
way, though it does not always seem to us the nearest way. (4.) Some
events are mentioned in this journal, as their want of water at Rephidim
([Num 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#014).md), the death of Aaron ([Num
33:38](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#038.md), [Num
33:39](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#039).md), the insult of Arad ([Num
33:40](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#040).md); and the very name of
Kibroth-hattaavah - the graves of lusts ([Num
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#016).md), has a story depending upon it.
Thus we ought to keep in mind the providences of God concerning us and
our families, us and our land, and the many instances of that divine
care which has led us, and fed us, and kept us, all our days hitherto.
Shittim, the place where the people sinned in the matter of Peor ([Num
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001).md), is here called Abel-shittim.
Abel signifies mourning (as [Gen
50:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#011).md), and probably this place was so
called from the mourning of the good people of Israel on account of that
sin and of God's wrath against them for it. It was so great a mourning
that it gave a name to the place.

[Numbers 33:50](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">num 33:50</span></span>

While the children of Israel were in the wilderness their total
separation from all other people kept them out of the way of temptation
to idolatry, and perhaps this was one thing intended by their long
confinement in the wilderness, that thereby the idols of Egypt might be
forgotten, and the people aired (as it were) and purified from that
infection, and the generation that entered Canaan might be such as never
knew those depths of Satan. But now that they were to pass over Jordan
they were entering again into that temptation, and therefore, 1. They
are here strictly charged utterly to destroy all remnants of idolatry.
They must not only drive out the inhabitants of the land, that they may
possess their country, but they must deface all their idolatrous
pictures and images, and pull down all their high places, [Num
33:52](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#052.md). They must not preserve any of
them, no, not as monuments of antiquity to gratify the curious, nor as
ornaments of their houses, nor toys for their children to play with, but
they must destroy all, both in token of their abhorrence and detestation
of idolatry and to prevent their being tempted to worship those images,
and the false gods represented by them, or to worship the God of Israel
by such images or representations. 2. They were assured that, if they
did so, God would by degrees put them in full possession of the land of
promise, [Num 33:53](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#053.md), [Num
33:54](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#054.md). If they would keep themselves
pure from the idols of Canaan, God would enrich them with the wealth of
Canaan. Learn not their way, and then fear not their power. 3. They were
threatened that, if they spared either the idols or the idolaters, they
should be beaten with their own rod and their sin would certainly be
their punishment. (1.) They would foster snakes in their own bosoms,
[Num 33:55](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#055.md). The remnant of the
Canaanites, if they made any league with them, though it were but a
cessation of arms, would be pricks in their eyes and thorns in their
sides, that is, they would be upon all occasions vexatious to them,
insulting them, robbing them, and, to the utmost of their power, making
mischief among them. We must expect trouble and affliction from that,
whatever it is, which we sinfully indulge; that which we are willing
should tempt us we shall find will vex us. (2.) The righteous God would
turn that wheel upon the Israelites which was to have crushed the
Canaanites: I shall do to you as I thought to do unto them, [Num
33:56](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#056.md). It was intended that the
Canaanites should be dispossessed; but if the Israelites fell in with
them, and learned their way, they should be dispossessed, for God's
displeasure would justly be greater against them than against the
Canaanites themselves. Let us hear this, and fear. If we do not drive
sin out, sin will drive us out; if we be not the death of our lusts, our
lusts will be the death of our souls.
