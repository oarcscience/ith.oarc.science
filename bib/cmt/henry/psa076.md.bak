### [Psalms Chapter 76](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 76:0</span></span>

This psalm seems to have been penned upon occasion of some great victory
obtained by the church over some threatening enemy or other, and
designed to grace the triumph. The Septuagint calls it, "A song upon the
Assyrians," whence many good interpreters conjecture that it was penned
when Sennacherib's army, then besieging Jerusalem, was entirely cut off
by a destroying angel in Hezekiah's time; and several passages in the
psalm are very applicable to that work of wonder: but there was a
religious triumph upon occasion of another victory, in Jehoshaphat's
time, which might as well be the subject of this psalm ([Ch2
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#028).md), and it might be called "a song
of Asaph" because always sung by the sons of Asaph. Or it might be
penned by Asaph who lived in David's time, upon occasion of the many
triumphs with which God delighted to honour that reign. Upon occasion of
this glorious victory, whatever it was, I. The psalmist congratulates
the happiness of the church in having God so nigh ([Psa
76:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001).md). II. He celebrates the glory
of God's power, which this was an illustrious instance of ([Psa
76:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#004).md). III. He infers hence what
reason all have to fear before him ([Psa
76:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#007).md). And, IV. What reason his
people have to trust in him and to pay their vows to him ([Psa
76:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#010).md). It is a psalm proper for a
thanksgiving day, upon the account of public successes, and not improper
at other times, because it is never out of season to glorify God for the
great things he has done for his church formerly, especially for the
victories of the Redeemer over the powers of darkness, which all those
Old Testament victories were types of, at least those that are
celebrated in the psalms.

To the chief musician on Neginoth. A psalm or song of Asaph.

[Psalms 76:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 76:1</span></span>

The church is here triumphant even in the midst of its militant state.
The psalmist, in the church's name, triumphs here in God, the centre of
all our triumphs.

I. In the revelation God had made of himself to them, [Psa
76:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md). It is the honour and privilege
of Judah and Israel that among them God is known, and where he is known
his name will be great. God is known as he is pleased to make himself
known; and those are happy to whom he discovers himself - happy people
that have their land filled with the knowledge of God, happy persons
that have their hearts filled with that knowledge. In Judah God was
known as he was not known in other nations, which made the favour the
greater, inasmuch as it was distinguishing, [Psa
147:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#019.md), [Psa
147:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#020.md).

II\. In the tokens of God's special presence with them in his
ordinances, [Psa 76:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#002.md). In the whole
land of Judah and Israel God was known and his name was great; but in
Salem, in Zion, were his tabernacle and his dwelling-place. There he
kept court; there he received the homage of his people by their
sacrifices and entertained them by the feasts upon the sacrifices;
thither they came to address themselves to him, and thence by his
oracles he issued out his orders; there he recorded his name, and of
that place he said, Her will I dwell, for I have desired it. It is the
glory and happiness of a people to have God among them by his
ordinances; but his dwelling-place is a tabernacle, a movable dwelling.
Yet a little while is that light with us.

III\. In the victories they had obtained over their enemies ([Psa
76:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#003).md): There broke he the arrows of
the bow. Observe how threatening the danger was. Though Judah and
Israel, Salem and Zion, were thus privileged, yet war is raised against
them, and the weapons of war are furbished.

1\. Here are bow and arrows, shield and sword, and all for battle; but
all are broken and rendered useless. And it was done there, (1.) In
Judah and in Israel, in favour of that people near to God. While the
weapons of war were used against other nations they answered their end,
but, when turned against that holy nation, they were immediately broken.
The Chaldee paraphrases it thus: When the house of Israel did his will
he placed his majesty among them, and there he broke the arrows of the
bow; while they kept closely to his service they were great and safe,
and every thing went well with them. Or, (2.) In the tabernacle and
dwelling-place in Zion, there he broke the arrows of the bow; it was
done in the field of battle, and yet it is said to be done in the
sanctuary, because done in answer to the prayers which God's people
there made to him and in the performance of the promises which he there
made to them, of both which see that instance, [Ch2
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#005.md), [Ch2
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#014.md). Public successes are owing as
much to what is done in the church as to what is done in the camp. Now,

2\. This victory redounded very much, (1.) To the immortal honour of
Israel's God ([Psa 76:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#004).md): Thou art,
and hast manifested thyself to be, more glorious and excellent than the
mountains of prey. \[1.\] "Than the great and mighty ones of the earth
in general, who are high, and think themselves firmly fixed like
mountains, but are really mountains of prey, oppressive to all about
them. It is their glory to destroy; it is thine to deliver." \[2.\]
"Than our invaders in particular. When they besieged the cities of
Judah, they cast up mounts against them, and raised batteries; but thou
art more able to protect us than they are to annoy us." Wherein the
enemies of the church deal proudly it will appear that God is above
them. (2.) To the perpetual disgrace of the enemies of Israel, [Psa
76:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#005.md), [Psa
76:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#006.md). They were stouthearted, men of
great courage and resolution, flushed with their former victories,
enraged against Israel, confident of success; they were men of might,
robust and fit for service; they had chariots and horses, which were
then greatly valued and trusted to in war, [Psa
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007.md). But all this force was of no
avail when it was levelled against Jerusalem. \[1.\] The stouthearted
have despoiled and disarmed themselves (so some read it); when God
pleases he can make his enemies to weaken and destroy themselves. They
have slept, not the sleep of the righteous, who sleep in Jesus, but
their sleep, the sleep of sinners, that shall awake to everlasting shame
and contempt. \[2.\] The men of might can no more find their hands than
the stout-hearted can their spirit. As the bold men are cowed, so the
strong men are lamed, and cannot so much as find their hands, to save
their own heads, much less to hurt their enemies. \[3.\] The chariots
and horses may be truly said to be cast into a dead sleep when their
drivers and their riders were so. God did but speak the word, as the God
of Jacob that commands deliverances for Jacob, and, at his rebuke, the
chariot and horse were both cast into a dead sleep. When the men were
laid dead upon the spot by the destroying angel the chariot and horse
were not at all formidable. See the power and efficacy of God's rebukes.
With what pleasure may we Christians apply all this to the advantages we
enjoy by the Redeemer! It is through him that God is known; it is in him
that God's name is great; to him it is owing that God has a tabernacle
and a dwelling-place in his church. He it was that vanquished the strong
man armed, spoiled principalities and powers, and made a show of them
openly.

[Psalms 76:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 76:7</span></span>

This glorious victory with which God had graced and blessed his church
is here made to speak three things: -

I. Terror to God's enemies ([Psa
76:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#007).md): "Thou, even thou, art to be
feared; thy majesty is to be reverenced, thy sovereignty to be submitted
to, and thy justice to be dreaded by those that have offended thee." Let
all the world learn by this event to stand in awe of the great God. 1.
Let all be afraid of his wrath against the daring impiety of sinners:
Who may stand in thy sight from the minute that thou art angry? If God
be a consuming fire, how can chaff and stubble stand before him, though
his anger be kindled but a little? [Psa
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012.md). 2. Let all be afraid of his
jealousy for oppressed innocency and the injured cause of his own
people: "Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven, then when
thou didst arise to save all the meek of the earth ([Psa
76:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#008.md), [Psa
76:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#009).md); and then the earth feared and
was still, waiting what would be the issue of those glorious appearances
of thine." Note, (1.) God's people are the meek of the earth ([Zac
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#003).md), the quiet in the land ([Psa
35:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#020).md), that can bear any wrong, but
do none. (2.) Though the meek of the earth are by their meekness exposed
to injury, yet God will, sooner or later, appear for their salvation,
and plead their cause. (3.) When God comes to save all the meek of the
earth, he will cause judgment to be heard from heaven; he will make the
world know that he is angry at the oppressors of his people, and takes
what is done against them as done against himself. The righteous God
long seems to keep silence, yet, sooner or later, he will make judgment
to be heard. (4.) When God is speaking judgment from heaven it is time
for the earth to compose itself into an awful and reverent silence: The
earth feared and was still, as silence is made by proclamation when the
court sits. Be still and know that I am God, [Psa
46:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#010.md). Be silent, O all flesh! before
the Lord, for he is raised up to judgment, [Zac
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#013.md). Those that suppose this psalm to
have been penned upon the occasion of the routing of Sennacherib's army
take it for granted that the descent of the destroying angel, who did
the execution, was accompanied with thunder, by which God caused
judgment to be heard from heaven, and that the earth feared (that is,
there was an earthquake), but it was soon over. But this is altogether
uncertain.

II\. Comfort to God's people, [Psa
76:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#010.md). We live in a very angry
provoking world; we often feel much, and are apt to fear more, from the
wrath of man, which seems boundless. But this is a great comfort to us,
1. That as far as God permits the wrath of man to break forth at any
time he will make it turn to his praise, will bring honour to himself
and serve his own purposes by it: Surely the wrath of man shall praise
thee, not only by the checks given to it, when it shall be forced to
confess its own impotency, but even by the liberty given to it for a
time. The hardships which God's people suffer by the wrath of their
enemies are made to redound to the glory of God and his grace; and the
more the heathen rage and plot against the Lord and his anointed the
more will God be praised for setting his King upon his holy hill of Zion
in spite of them, [Psa 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md), [Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md). When the heavenly hosts make this
the matter of their thanksgiving-song that God has taken to himself his
great power and has reigned, though the nations were angry ([Rev
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#017.md), [Rev
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#018).md), then the wrath of man adds
lustre to the praises of God. 2. That what will not turn to his praise
shall not be suffered to break out: The remainder of wrath shalt thou
restrain. Men must never permit sin, because they cannot check it when
they will; but God can. He can set bounds to the wrath of man, as he
does to the raging sea. Hitherto it shall come and no further; here
shall its proud waves be stayed. God restrained the remainder of
Sennacherib's rage, for he put a hook in his nose and a bridle in his
jaws ([Isa 37:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#029).md); and, though he
permitted him to talk big, he restrained him from doing what he
designed.

III\. Duty to all, [Psa 76:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#011.md), [Psa
76:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#012.md). Let all submit themselves to
this great God and become his loyal subjects. Observe, 1. The duty
required of us all, all that are about him, that have any dependence
upon him or any occasion to approach to him; and who is there that has
not? We are therefore every one of us commanded to do our homage to the
King of kings: Vow and pay; that is, take an oath of allegiance to him
and make conscience of keeping it. Vow to be his, and pay what you vow.
Bind your souls with a bond to him (for that is the nature of a vow),
and then live up to the obligations you have laid upon yourselves; for
better it is not to vow than to vow and not to pay. And, having taken
him for our King, let us bring presents to him, as subjects to their
sovereign, [Sa1 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#027.md). Send you the
lamb to the ruler of the land, [Isa
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001.md). Not that God needs any present
we can bring, or can be benefited by it; but thus we must give him
honour and own that we have our all from him. Our prayers and praises,
and especially our hearts, are the presents we should bring to the Lord
our God. 2. The reasons to enforce this duty: Render to all their due,
fear to whom fear is due; and is it not due to God? Yes; (1.) He ought
to be feared: He is the fear (so the word is); his name is glorious and
fearful,; and he is the proper object of our fear; with him is terrible
majesty. The God of Abraham is called the fear of Isaac ([Gen
31:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#042).md), and we are commanded to make
him our fear, [Isa 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#013.md). When we bring
presents to him we must have an eye to him as greatly to be feared; for
he is terrible in his holy places. (2.) He will be feared, even by those
who think it their own sole prerogative to be feared ([Psa
76:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#012).md): He shall cut off the spirit of
princes; he shall slip it off as easily as we slip off a flower from the
stalk or a bunch of grapes from the vine; so the word signifies. He can
dispirit those that are most daring and make them heartless; for he is,
or will be, terrible to the kings of the earth; and sooner or later, if
they be not so wise as to submit themselves to him, he will force them
to call in vain to rocks and mountains to fall on them and hide them
from his wrath, [Rev 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#016.md). Since there
is no contending with God, it is as much our wisdom as it is our duty to
submit to him.
