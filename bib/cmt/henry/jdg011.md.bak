### [Judges Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#001.md)

[Judges](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jdg 11:0</span></span>

This chapter gives as the history of Jephthah, another of Israel's
judges, and numbered among the worthies of the Old Testament, that by
faith did great things ([Heb 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#032).md),
though he had not such an extraordinary call as the rest there mentioned
had. Here we have, I. The disadvantages of his origin ([Jdg
11:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#001).md). II. The Gileadites' choice of
him to be commander-in-chief against the Ammonites, and the terms he
made with them ([Jdg 11:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#004).md). III.
His treaty with the king of Ammon about the rights of the two nations,
that the matter might be determined, if possible, without bloodshed (v.
12-28). IV. His war with the Ammonites, which he enters upon with a
solemn vow ([Jdg 11:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#029).md), prosecutes
with bravery ([Jdg 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#032).md), and ends
with a glorious victory ([Jdg 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#033).md).
V. The straits he was brought into at his return to his own house by the
vow he had made ([Jdg 11:34-40](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#034).md).

[Judges 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 11:1</span></span>

The princes and people of Gilead we left, in the close of the foregoing
chapter, consulting about the choice of a general, having come to this
resolve, that whoever would undertake to lead their forces against the
children of Ammon should by common consent be head over all the
inhabitants of Gilead. The enterprise was difficult, and it was fit that
so great an encouragement as this should be proposed to him that would
undertake it. Now all agreed that Jephthah, the Gileadite, was a mighty
man of valour, and very fit for that purpose, none so fit as he, but he
lay under three disadvantages: - 1. He was the son of a harlot ([Jdg
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#001).md), of a strange woman ([Jdg
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#002).md), one that was neither a wife nor
a concubine; some think his mother was a Gentile; so Josephus, who calls
him a stranger by the mother's side. An Ishmaelite, say the Jews. If his
mother was a harlot, that was not his fault, however it was his
disgrace. Men ought not to be reproached with any of the infelicities of
their parentage or extraction, so long as they are endeavouring by their
personal merits to roll away the reproach. The son of a harlot, if born
again, born from above, shall be accepted of God, and be as welcome as
any other to the glorious liberties of his children. Jephthah could not
read in the law the brand there put on the Ammonites, the enemies he was
to grapple with, that they should not enter into the congregation of the
Lord, but in the same paragraph he met with that which looked black upon
himself, that a bastard should be in like manner excluded, [Deu
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#002.md), [Deu
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003.md). But if that law means, as most
probably it does, only those that are born of incest, not of
fornication, he was not within the reach of it. 2. He had been driven
from his country by his brethren. His father's legitimate children,
insisting upon the rigour of the law, thrust him out from having any
inheritance with them, without any consideration of his extraordinary
qualifications, which merited a dispensation, and would have made him a
mighty strength and ornament of their family, if they had overlooked his
being illegitimate and admitted him to a child's part, [Jdg
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#002.md). One would not have thought this
abandoned youth was intended to be Israel's deliverer and judge, but God
often humbles those whom he designs to exalt, and makes that stone the
head of the corner which the builders refused; so Joseph, Moses, and
David, the three most eminent of the shepherds of Israel, were all
thrust out by men, before they were called of God to their great
offices. 3. He had, in his exile, headed a rabble, [Jdg
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#003.md). Being driven out by his
brethren, his great soul would not suffer him either to dig or beg, but
by his sword he must live; and, being soon noted for his bravery, those
that were reduced to such straits, and animated by such a spirit,
enlisted themselves under him. Vain men they are here called, that is,
men that had run through their estates and had to seek for a livelihood.
These went out with him, not to rob or plunder, but to hunt wild beasts,
and perhaps to make incursions upon those countries which Israel was
entitled to, but had not as yet come to the possession of, or were some
way or other injured by. This is the man that must save Israel. That
people had by their idolatry made themselves children of whoredoms, and
aliens from God and his covenant, and therefore, though God upon their
repentance will deliver them, yet, to mortify them and remind them of
their sin, he chooses to do it by a bastard and an exile.

[Judges 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 11:4</span></span>

Here is, I. The distress which the children of Israel were in upon the
Ammonites' invasion of their country, [Jdg
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#004.md). Probably this was the same
invasion with that mentioned, [Jdg
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#017.md), when the children of Ammon were
gathered together and encamped in or against Gilead. And those words, in
process of time, refer to what goes immediately before of the expulsion
of Jephthah; many days after he had been thus thrust out in disgrace was
he fetched back again with honour.

II\. The court which the elders made to Jephthah hereupon to come and
help them. They did not write or send a messenger to him, but went
themselves to fetch him, resolving to have no denial, and the exigence
of the case was such as would admit no delay. Their errand to him was,
Come, and be our captain, [Jdg 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#006.md).
They knew none among themselves that was able to undertake that great
trust, but in effect confessed themselves unfit for it; they know him to
be a bold man, and inured to the sword, and therefore he must be the
man. See how God prepared men for the service he designs them for, and
makes their troubles work for their advancement. If Jephthah had not
been put to his shifts by his brethren's unkindness, he would not have
had such occasion as this gave him to exercise and improve his martial
genius, and so to signalize himself and become famous. Out of the eater
comes forth meat. The children of Israel were assembled and encamped,
[Jdg 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#017.md). But an army without a
general is like a body without a head; therefore Come, say they, and be
our captain, that we may fight. See the necessity of government; though
they were hearty enough in the cause, yet they owned they could not
fight without a captain to command them. So necessary is it to all
societies that there be a pars imperans and a pars subdita, some to rule
and others to obey, that any community would humbly beg the favour of
being commanded rather than that every man should be his own master.
Blessed be God for government, for a good government.

III\. The objections Jephthah makes against accepting their offer: Did
you not hate me, and expel me? [Jdg
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#007.md). It should seem that his brethren
were some of these elders, or these elders by suffering his brethren to
abuse him, and not righting him as they ought to have done (for their
business is to defend the poor and fatherless, [Psa
82:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#003.md), [Psa
82:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#004).md), had made themselves guilty of
his expulsion, and he might justly charge them with it. Magistrates,
that have power to protect those that are injured, if they neglect to
redress their grievances are really guilty of inflicting them. "You
hated me and expelled me, and therefore how can I believe that you are
sincere in this proposal, and how can you expect that I should do you
any service?" Not but that Jephthah was very willing to serve his
country, but he thought fit to give them a hint of their former
unkindness to him, that they might repent of their sin in using him so
ill, and might for the future be the more sensible of their obligations.
Thus Joseph humbled his brethren before he made himself known to them.
The particular case between the Gileadites and Jephthah was a
resemblance of the general state of the case between Israel and God at
this time. They had thrust God out by their idolatries, yet in their
distress begged his help; he told them how justly he might have rejected
them, and yet graciously delivered them. So did Jephthah. Many slight
God and good men till they come to be in distress, and then they are
desirous of God's mercy and good men's prayers.

IV\. Their urgency with him to accept the government they offer him,
[Jdg 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#008.md). "Therefore because we
formerly did thee that wrong, and to show thee that we repent of it and
would gladly atone for it, we turn again to thee now, to put such an
honour upon thee as shall balance that indignity." Let this instance be,
1. A caution to us not to despise or trample upon any because they are
mean, nor to be injurious to any that we have advantage against,
because, whatever we think of them now, the time may come when we may
have need of them, and may be glad to be beholden to them. It is our
wisdom to make no man our enemy, because we know not how soon our
distresses may be such as that we may be highly concerned to make him
our friend. 2. An encouragement to men of worth that are slighted or
ill-treated. Let them bear it with meekness and cheerfulness, and leave
it to God to make their light shine out of obscurity. Fuller's remark on
this story, in his "Pisgah Sight," is this: "Virtue once in an age will
work her own advancement, and, when such as hate it chance to need it,
they will be forced to prefer it," and then the honour will appear the
brighter.

V. The bargain he makes with them. He had mentioned the injuries they
had formerly done him, but, perceiving their repentance, his spirit was
too great and generous to mention them any more. God had forgiven Israel
the affronts they had put upon him ([Jdg
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#016).md), and therefore Jephthah will
forgive. Only he thinks it prudent to make his bargain wisely for the
future, since he deals with men that he had reason to distrust. 1. He
puts to them a fair question, [Jdg
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#009.md). He speaks not with too much
confidence of his success, knowing how justly God might suffer the
Ammonites to prevail for the further punishment of Israel; but puts an
if upon it. Nor does he speak with any confidence at all in himself; if
he do succeed, it is the Lord that delivers them into his hand,
intending hereby to remind his countrymen to look up to God, as
arbitrator of the controversy and the giver of victory, for so he did.
"Now if, by the blessing of God, I come home a conqueror, tell me
plainly shall I be your head? If I deliver you, under God, shall I,
under him, reform you?" The same question is put to those who desire
salvation by Christ. "If he save you, will you be willing that he shall
rule you? for on no other terms will he save you. If he make you happy,
shall he make you holy? If he be your helper, shall he be your head?" 2.
They immediately give him a positive answer ([Jdg
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#010).md): "We will do according to thy
words; command us in war, and thou shalt command us in peace." They do
not take time to consider of it. The case was too plain to need a
debate, and the necessity too pressing to admit a delay. They knew they
had power to conclude a treaty for those whom they represented, and
therefore bound it with an oath, The Lord be witness between us. They
appeal to God's omniscience as the judge of their present sincerity, and
to his justice as an avenger if afterwards they should prove false. The
Lord be a hearer, so the word is. Whatever we speak, it concerns us to
remember that God is a hearer, and to speak accordingly. Thus was the
original contract ratified between Jephthah and the Gileadites, which
all Israel, it should seem, agreed to afterwards, for it is said ([Jdg
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#007).md), he judged Israel. He hereupon
went with them ([Jdg 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#011).md) to the
place where they were all assembled ([Jdg
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#017).md), and there by common consent
they made him head and captain, and so ratified the bargain their
representatives had made with him, that he should be not only captain
now, but head for life. Jephthah, to obtain this little honour, was
willing to expose his life for them ([Jdg
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#003).md), and shall we be discouraged in
our Christian warfare by any of the difficulties we may meet with in it,
when Christ himself has promised a crown of life to him that overcometh?

VI\. Jephthah's pious acknowledgment of God in this great affair ([Jdg
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#011).md): He uttered all his words
before the Lord in Mizpeh, that is, upon his elevation, he immediately
retired to his devotions, and in prayer spread the whole matter before
God, both his choice to the office and his execution of the office, as
one that had his eye ever towards the Lord, and would do nothing without
him, that leaned not to his own understanding or courage, but depended
on God and his favour. He utters before God all his thoughts and cares
in this matter; for God gives us leave to be free with him. 1. "Lord,
the people have made me their head; wilt thou confirm the choice, and
own me as thy people's head under thee and for thee?" God justly
complains of Israel ([Hos 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004).md), they
have set up kings, but not by me. "Lord," said Jephthah, "I will be no
head of their making without thee. I will not accept the government
unless thou give me leave." Had Abimelech done this, he might have
prospered. 2. "Lord, they have made me their captain, to go before them
in this war with the Ammonites; shall I have thy presence? Wilt thou go
before me? If not, carry me not up hence. Lord, satisfy me in the
justice of the cause. Assure me of success in the enterprise." This is a
rare example, to be imitated by all, particularly by great ones; in all
our ways let us acknowledge God, seek his favour, ask counsel at his
mouth, and take him along with us; so shall we make our way prosperous.
Thus Jephthah opened the campaign with prayer. That was likely to end
gloriously which began thus piously.

[Judges 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 11:12</span></span>

We have here the treaty between Jephthah, now judge of Israel, and the
king of the Ammonites (who is not named), that the controversy between
the two nations might, if possible, be accommodated without the effusion
of blood.

I. Jephthah, as one having authority, sent to the king of Ammon, who in
this war was the aggressor, to demand his reasons for invading the land
of Israel: "Why hast thou come to fight against me in my land? [Jdg
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#012.md). Had I come first into thy land
to disturb thee in thy possession, this would have been reason enough
for fighting against me, for how must force be repelled but by force?
but what hast thou to do to come thus in a hostile manner into my land?"
so he calls it, in the name both of God and Israel. Now this fair demand
shows, 1. That Jephthah did not delight in war, though he was a mighty
man of valour, but was willing to prevent it by a peaceable
accommodation. If he could by reason persuade the invaders to retire, he
would not compel them to do it by the sword. War should be the last
remedy, not to be used till all other methods of ending matters in
variance have been tried in vain, ratio ultima regum - the last resource
of kings. This rule should be observed in going to law. The sword of
justice, as well as the sword of war, must not be appealed to till the
contending parties have first endeavoured by gentler means to understand
one another, and to accommodate matters in variance, [Co1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#001.md). 2. That Jephthah did delight in
equity, and designed no other than to do justice. If the children of
Ammon could convince him that Israel had done them wrong, he was ready
to restore the rights of the Ammonites. If not, it was plain by their
invasion that they did Israel wrong, and he was ready to maintain the
rights of the Israelites. A sense of justice should guide and govern us
in all our undertakings.

II\. The king of the Ammonites now gives in his demand, which he should
have published before he had invaded Israel, [Jdg
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#013.md). His pretence is, "Israel took
away my lands long since; now therefore restore those lands." We have
reason to think the Ammonites, when they made this descent upon Israel,
meant no other than to spoil and plunder the country, and enrich
themselves with the prey, as they had done formerly under Eglon ([Jdg
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#013).md) when no such demand as this was
made, though the matter was then fresh; but when Jephthah demanded the
cause of their quarrel, and they could not for shame own what was their
true intent and meaning, some old musty records were searched, or some
ancient traditions enquired into, and from them this reason was drawn to
serve the present turn, for a colourable pretence of equity in the
invasion. Even those that do the greatest wrong yet have such a
conviction in their consciences of justice that they would seem to do
right. Restore those lands. See upon what uncertain terms we hold our
worldly possessions; what we think we have the surest hold of may be
challenged from us, and wrested out of our hands. Those that have got to
the heavenly Canaan need not fear having their titles questioned.

III\. Jephthah gives in a very full and satisfactory answer to this
demand, showing it to be altogether unjust and unreasonable, and that
the Ammonites had no title to this country that lay between the rivers
Arnon and Jabbok, now in the possession of the tribes of Reuben and Gad.
As one very well versed in the history of his country, he shows,

1\. That Israel never took any land away either from the Moabites or
Ammonites. He puts them together because they were brethren, the
children of Lot, near neighbours, and of united interests, having the
same god, Chemosh, and perhaps sometimes the same king. The lands in
question Israel took away, not from the Moabites or Ammonites (they had
particular orders from God not to meddle with them nor any thing they
had, [Deu 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009.md), [Deu
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#019.md), and religiously observed their
orders), but they found them in the possession of Sihon king of the
Amorites, and out of his hand they took them justly and honourably, as
he will show afterwards. If the Amorites, before Israel came into that
country, had taken these lands from the Moabites or Ammonites, as it
should seem they had ([Num 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#026.md); [Jos
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#025).md), Israel was not concerned to
enquire into that or answer for it. If the Ammonites had lost these
lands and their title to them, the children of Israel were under no
obligation to recover the possession for them. Their business was to
conquer for themselves, not for other people. This is his first plea,
"Not guilty of the trespass."

2\. That they were so far from invading the property of any other
nations than the devoted posterity of cursed Canaan (one of the branches
of which the Amorites were, [Gen
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#016).md) that they would not so much as
force a passage through the country either of the Edomites, the seed of
Esau, or of the Moabites, the seed of Lot; but even after a very tedious
march through the wilderness, with which they were sadly tired ([Jdg
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#016).md), when the king of Edom first,
and afterwards the king of Moab, denied them the courtesy of a way
through their country ([Jdg 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#017).md),
rather than give them any offence or annoyance, weary as they were, they
put themselves to the further fatigue of compassing both the land of
Edom and that of Moab, and came not within the border of either, [Jdg
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#018.md). Note, Those that behave
themselves inoffensively may take the comfort of it, and plead it
against those that charge them with injustice and wrong doing. Our
righteousness will answer for us in time to come ([Gen
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#033).md) and will put to silence the
ignorance of foolish men, [Pe1 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#015.md).

3\. That in that war in which they took this land out of the hands of
Sihon king of the Amorites he was the aggressor, and not they, [Jdg
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#019.md), [Jdg
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#020.md). They sent a humble petition to
him for leave to go through his land, willing to give him any security
for their good behaviour in their march. "Let us pass (say they) unto
our place, that is, to the land of Canaan, which is the only place we
call ours, and to which we are pressing forward, not designing a
settlement here." But Sihon not only denied them this courtesy, as Edom
and Moab had done (had he only done so, who knows but Israel might have
gone about some other way?) but he mustered all his forces, and fought
against Israel ([Jdg 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#020).md), not only
shut them out of his own land, but would have cut them off from the face
of the earth ([Num 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#023.md), [Num
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#024).md), aimed at nothing less than
their ruin, [Jdg 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#020.md). Israel
therefore, in their war with him, stood in their own just and necessary
defence, and therefore, having routed his army, might justly, in further
revenge of the injury, seize his country as forfeited. Thus Israel came
to the possession of this country, and doubted not to make good their
title to it; and it is very unreasonable for the Ammonites to question
their title, for the Amorites were the inhabitants of that country, and
it was purely their land and their coasts that the Israelites then made
themselves masters of, [Jdg 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#021.md),
[Jdg 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#022.md).

4\. He pleads a grant from the crown, and claims under that, [Jdg
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#023.md), [Jdg
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#024.md). It was not Israel (they were
fatigued with their long march, and were not fit for action so soon),
but it was the Lord God of Israel, who is King of nations, whose the
earth is and the fulness thereof, he it was that dispossessed the
Amorites and planted Israel in their room. God gave them the land by an
express and particular conveyance, such as vested the title in them,
which they might make good against all the world. [Deu
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#024.md), I have given into thy hand Sihon
and his land; he gave it to them, by giving them a complete victory over
the present occupants, notwithstanding the great disadvantages they were
under. "Can you think that God gave it to us in such an extraordinary
manner with design that we should return it to the Moabites or Ammonites
again? No, we put a higher value upon God's favours than to part with
them so easily." To corroborate this plea, he urges an argument ad
hominem - directed to the man: Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh
thy god giveth thee? He not only appeals to the common resolutions of
men to hold their own against all the world, but to the common religion
of the nations, which, they thought, obliged them to make much of that
which their gods gave them. Not that Jephthah thought Chemosh a god,
only he is thy god, and the worshippers even of those dunghill deities
that could do neither good nor evil yet thought themselves beholden to
them for all they had ([Hos 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#012.md),
These are my rewards which my lovers have given me; and see [Jdg
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#024).md) and made this a reason why they
would hold it fast, that their gods gave it to them. "This thou thinkest
a good title, and shall not we?" The Ammonites had dispossessed those
that dwelt in their land before them; they thought they did it by the
help of Chemosh their god, but really it was Jehovah the God of Israel
that did it for them, as is expressly said, [Deu
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#019.md), [Deu
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#021.md). "Now," says Jephthah, "we have
as good a title to our country as you have to yours." Note, One instance
of the honour and respect we owe to God, as our God, is rightly to
possess that which he gives us to possess, receive it from him, use it
for him, keep it for his sake, and part with it when he calls for it. He
has given it to us to possess, not to enjoy. He himself only must be
enjoyed.

5\. He pleads prescription. (1.) Their title had not been disputed when
they first entered upon it, [Jdg
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#025.md). "Balak who was then king of
Moab, from whom the greatest part of these lands had been taken by the
Amorites, and who was most concerned and best able to oppose us, if he
had had any thing to object against our settlement there, yet sat still,
and never offered to strive against Israel." He knew that for his own
part he had fairly lost it to the Amorites and was not able to recover
it, and could not but acknowledge that Israel had fairly won it of the
Amorites, and therefore all his care was to secure what was left: he
never pretended a title to what was lost. See [Num
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#002.md), [Num
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#003.md). "He then acquiesced in God's way
of disposing of kingdoms, and wilt not thou now?" (2.) Their possession
had never yet been disturbed, [Jdg
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#026.md). He pleads that they had kept
this country as their own now about 300 years, and the Ammonites in all
that time had never attempted to take it from them, no, not when they
had it in their power to oppress them, [Jdg
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#013.md), [Jdg
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#014.md). So that, supposing their title
had not been clear at the first (which yet he had proved it was), yet,
no claim having been made for so many generations, the entry of the
children of Ammon, without doubt, was barred for ever. A title so long
unquestioned shall be presumed unquestionable.

6\. By these arguments Jephthah justifies himself and his own cause ("I
have not sinned against thee in taking or keeping what I have no right
to; if I had, I would instantly make restitution"), and condemns the
Ammonites: "Thou doest me wrong to war against me, and must expect to
speed accordingly," [Jdg 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#027.md). It
seems to me an evidence that the children of Israel, in the days of
their prosperity and power (for some such days they had in the times of
the judges) had conducted themselves very inoffensively to all their
neighbours and had not been vexatious or oppressing to them (either by
way of reprisal or under colour of propagating their religion), that the
king of the Ammonites, when he would seek an occasion of quarrelling
with them, was forced to look 300 years back for a pretence. It becomes
the people of God thus to be blameless and harmless, and without rebuke.

7\. For the deciding of the controversy, he puts himself upon God and
his sword, and the king of Ammon joins issue with him ([Jdg
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#027.md), [Jdg
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#028).md): The Lord the Judge be judge
this day. With this solemn reference of the matter to the Judge of
heaven and earth he designs either to deter the Ammonites from
proceeding and oblige them to retire, when they saw the right of the
cause was against them, or to justify himself in subduing them if they
should go on. Note, War is an appeal to heaven, to God the Judge of all,
to whom the issues of it belong. If doubtful rights be disputed, he is
hereby requested to determine them. If manifest rights be invaded or
denied, he is hereby applied to for the vindicating of what is just and
the punishing of wrong. As the sword of justice was made for lawless and
disobedient persons ([Ti1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009).md), so was
the sword of war made for lawless and disobedient princes and nations.
In war therefore the eye must be ever up to God, and it must always be
thought a dangerous thing to desire or expect that God should patronise
unrighteousness.

Neither Jephthah's apology, nor his appeal, wrought upon the king of the
children of Ammon; they had found the sweets of the spoil of Israel, in
the eighteen years wherein they had oppressed them ([Jdg
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#008).md), and hoped now to make
themselves masters of the tree with the fruit of which they had so often
enriched themselves. He hearkened not to the words of Jephthah, his
heart being hardened to his destruction.

[Judges 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jdg 11:29</span></span>

We have here Jephthah triumphing in a glorious victory, but, as an alloy
to his joy, troubled and distressed by an unadvised vow.

I. Jephthah's victory was clear, and shines very brightly, both to his
honour and to the honour of God, his in pleading and God's in owning a
righteous cause. 1. God gave him an excellent spirit, and he improved it
bravely, [Jdg 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#029.md). When it appeared
by the people's unanimous choice of him for their leader that he had so
clear a call to engage, and by the obstinate deafness of the king of
Ammon to the proposals of accommodation that he had so just a cause to
engage in, then the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and very much
advanced his natural faculties, enduing him with power from on high, and
making him more bold and more wise than ever he had been, and more fired
with a holy zeal against the enemies of his people. Hereby God confirmed
him in his office, and assured him of success in his undertaking. Thus
animated, he loses no time, but with an undaunted resolution takes the
field. Particular notice is taken of the way by which he advanced
towards the enemy's camp, probably because the choice of it was an
instance of that extraordinary discretion with which the Spirit of the
Lord had furnished him; for those who sincerely walk after the Spirit
shall be led forth the right way. 2. God gave him eminent success, and
he bravely improved that too ([Jdg
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#032).md): The Lord delivered the
Ammonites into his hand, and so gave judgment upon the appeal in favour
of the righteous cause, and made those feel the force of war that would
not yield to the force of reason; for he sits in the throne, judging
right. Jephthah lost not the advantages given him, but pursued and
completed his victory. Having routed their forces in the field, he
pursued them to their cities, where he put to the sword all he found in
arms, so as utterly to disable them from giving Israel any molestation,
[Jdg 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#033.md). But it does not appear
that he utterly destroyed the people, as Joshua had destroyed the
devoted nations, nor that he offered to make himself master of the
country, though their pretensions to the land of Israel might have given
him colour to do so: only he took care that they should be effectually
subdued. Though others' attempting wrong to us will justify us in the
defence of our own right, yet it will not authorize us to do them wrong.

II\. Jephthah's vow is dark, and much in the clouds. When he was going
out from his own house upon this hazardous undertaking, in prayer to God
for his presence with him he makes a secret but solemn vow or religious
promise to God, that, if God would graciously bring him back a
conqueror, whosoever or whatsoever should first come out of his house to
meet him it should be devoted to God, and offered up for a
burnt-offering. At his return, tidings of his victory coming home before
him, his own and only daughter meets him with the seasonable expressions
of joy. This puts him into a great confusion; but there was no remedy:
after she had taken some time to lament her own infelicity, she
cheerfully submitted to the performance of his vow. Now,

1\. There are several good lessons to be learnt out of this story. (1.)
That there may be remainders of distrust and doubting even in the hearts
of true and great believers. Jephthah had reason enough to be confident
of success, especially when he found the Spirit of the Lord come upon
him, and yet, now that it comes to the settling, he seems to hesitate
(v. 30): If thou wilt without fail deliver them into my hand, then I
will do so and so. And perhaps the snare into which his vow brought him
was designed to correct the weakness of his faith, and a fond conceit he
had that he could not promise himself a victory unless he proffered
something considerable to be given to God in lieu of it. (2.) That yet
it is very good, when we are in the pursuit or expectation of any mercy,
to make vows to God of some instance of acceptable service to him, not
as a purchase of the favour we desire, but as an expression of our
gratitude to him and the deep sense we have of our obligations to render
according to the benefit done to us. The matter of such a singular vow
([Lev 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#002).md) must be something that has
a plain and direct tendency either to the advancement of God's glory,
and the interests of his kingdom among men, or to the furtherance of
ourselves in his service, and in that which is antecedently our duty.
(3.) That we have great need to be very cautious and well advised in the
making of such vows, lest, by indulging a present emotion even of pious
zeal, we entangle our own consciences, involve ourselves in
perplexities, and are forced at last to say before the angel that it was
an error, [Ecc 5:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#002.md). It is a snare to
a man hastily to devour that which is holy, without due consideration
quid valeant humeri, quid ferre recusent - what we are able or unable to
effect, and without inserting the needful provisos and limitations which
might prevent the entanglement, and then after vows to make the enquiry
which should have been made before, [Pro
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#025.md). Let Jephthah's harm be our
warning in this matter. See [Deu
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#022). (4..md) That what we have solemnly
vowed to God we must conscientiously perform, if it be possible and
lawful, though it be ever so difficult and grievous to us. Jephthah's
sense of the powerful obligation of his vow must always be ours ([Jdg
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#035).md): "I have opened my mouth unto
the Lord in a solemn vow, and I cannot go back," that is, "I cannot
recall the vow myself, it is too late, nor can any power on earth
dispense with it, or give me up my bond." The thing was my own, and in
my own power ([Act 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#004).md), but now it is
not. Vow and pay, [Psa 76:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#011.md). We
deceive ourselves if we think to mock God. If we apply this to the
consent we have solemnly given, in our sacramental vows, to the covenant
of grace made with poor sinners in Christ, what a powerful argument will
it be against the sins we have by those vows bound ourselves out from,
what a strong inducement to the duties we have hereby bound ourselves up
to, and what a ready answer to every temptation! "I have opened my mouth
to the Lord, and I cannot go back; I must therefore go forward. I have
sworn, and I must, I will, perform it. Let me not dare to play fast and
loose with God." (5.) That it well becomes children obediently and
cheerfully to submit to their parents in the Lord, and particularly to
comply with their pious resolutions for the honour of God and the
keeping up of religion in their families, though they be harsh and
severe, as the Rechabites, who for many generations religiously observed
the commands of Jonadab their father in forbearing wine, and Jephthah's
daughter here, who, for the satisfying of her father's conscience, and
for the honour of God and her country, yielded herself as one devoted
([Jdg 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#036).md): "Do to me according to
that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; I know I am dear to thee,
but am well content that God should be dearer." The father might
disallow any vow made by the daughter ([Num
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#005).md), but the daughter could not
disallow or disannul, no, not such a vow as this, made by the father.
This magnifies the law of the fifth commandment. (6.) That our friends'
grievances should be our griefs. Where she went to bewail her hard fate
the virgins, her companions, joined with her in her lamentations, [Jdg
11:38](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#038.md). With those of her own sex and
age she used to associate, who no doubt, now that her father had on a
sudden grown so great, expected, shortly after his return, to dance at
her wedding, but were heavily disappointed when they were called to
retire to the mountains with her and share in her griefs. Those are
unworthy the name of friends that will only rejoice with us, and not
weep with us. (7.) That heroic zeal for the honour of God and Israel,
though alloyed with infirmity and indiscretion, is worthy to be had in
perpetual remembrance. It well became the daughters of Israel by an
annual solemnity to preserve the honourable memory of Jephthah's
daughter, who made light even of her own life like a noble heroine, when
God had taken vengeance on Israel's enemies, [Jdg
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#036.md). Such a rare instance of one
that preferred the public interest before life itself was never to be
forgotten. Her sex forbade her to follow to the war, and so to expose
her life in battle, in lieu of which she hazards it much more (and
perhaps apprehended that she did so, having some intimation of his vow,
and did it designedly; for he tells her, [Jdg
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#035), Thou hast brought me very low.md)
to grace his triumphs. So transported was she with the victory as a
common benefit that she was willing to be herself offered up as a
thank-offering for it, and would think her life well bestowed when laid
down on so great an occasion. She thinks it an honour to die, not as a
sacrifice of atonement for the people's sins (that honour was reserved
for Christ only), but as a sacrifice of acknowledgment for the people's
mercies. (8.) From Jephthah's concern on this occasion, we must learn
not to think it strange if the day of our triumphs in this world prove
upon some account or other the day of our griefs, and therefore must
always rejoice with trembling; we hope for a day of triumph hereafter
which will have no alloy.

2\. Yet there are some difficult questions that do arise upon this story
which have very much employed the pens of learned men. I will say but
little respecting them, because Mr. Poole has discussed them very fully
in his English annotations.

(1.) It is hard to say what Jephthah did to his daughter in performance
of his vow. \[1.\] Some think he only shut her up for a nun, and that it
being unlawful, according to one part of his vow (for they make it
disjunctive), to offer her up for a burnt-offering, he thus, according
to the other part, engaged her to be the Lord's, that is, totally to
sequester herself from all the affairs of this life, and consequently
from marriage, and to employ herself wholly in the acts of devotion all
her days. That which countenances this opinion is that she is said to
bewail her virginity ([Jdg 11:37](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#037.md), [Jdg
11:38](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#038).md) and that she knew no man, [Jdg
11:39](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#039.md). But, if he sacrificed her, it
was proper enough for her to bewail, not her death, because that was
intended to be for the honour of God, and she would undergo it
cheerfully, but that unhappy circumstance of it which made it more
grievous to her than any other, because she was her father's only child,
in whom he hoped his name and family would be built up, that she was
unmarried, and so left no issue to inherit her father's honour and
estate; therefore it is particularly taken notice of ([Jdg
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#034).md) that besides her he had neither
son nor daughter. But that which makes me think Jephthah did not go
about thus to satisfy his vow, or evade it rather, is that we do not
find any law, usage, or custom, in all the Old Testament, which does in
the least intimate that a single life was any branch or article of
religion, or that any person, man or woman, was looked upon as the more
holy, more the Lord's, or devoted to him, for living unmarried: it was
no part of the law either of the priests or of the Nazarites. Deborah
and Huldah, both prophetesses, are both of them particularly recorded to
have been married women. Besides, had she only been confined to a single
life, she needed not to have desired these two months to bewail it in:
she had her whole life before her to do that, if she saw cause. Nor
needed she to take such a sad leave of her companions; for those that
are of that opinion understand what is said in [Jdg
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#040.md) of their coming to talk with
her, as our margin reads it, four days in a year. Therefore, \[2.\] It
seems more probable that he offered her up for a sacrifice, according to
the letter of his vow, misunderstanding that law which spoke of persons
devoted by the curse of God as if it were to be applied to such as were
devoted by men's vows ([Lev 27:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#029.md),
None devoted shall be redeemed, but shall surely be put to death), and
wanting to be better informed of the power the law gave him in this case
to redeem her. Abraham's attempt to offer up Isaac perhaps encouraged
him, and made him think, if God would not accept this sacrifice which he
had vowed, he would send an angel to stay his hand, as he did Abraham's.
If she came out designedly to be made a sacrifice, as who knows but she
might? perhaps he thought that would make the case the plainer. Volenti
non sit injuria - No injury is done to a person by that to which he
himself consents. He imagined, it may be, that where there was neither
anger nor malice there was no murder, and that his good intention would
sanctify this bad action; and, since he had made such a vow, he thought
better to kill his daughter than break his vow, and let Providence bear
the blame, that brought her forth to meet him.

(2.) But, supposing that Jephthah did sacrifice his daughter, the
question is whether he did well. \[1.\] Some justify him in it, and
think he did well, and as became one that preferred the honour of God
before that which was dearest to him in this world. He is mentioned
among the eminent believers who by faith did great things, [Heb
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#032.md). And this was one of the great
things he did. It was done deliberately, and upon two months'
consideration and consultation. He is never blamed for it by any
inspired writer. Though it highly exalts the paternal authority, yet it
cannot justify any in doing the like. He was an extraordinary person.
The Spirit of the Lord came upon him. Many circumstances, now unknown to
us, might make this altogether extraordinary, and justify it, yet not so
as that it might justify the like. Some learned men have made this
sacrifice a figure of Christ the great sacrifice: he was of unspotted
purity and innocency, as she a chaste virgin; he was devoted to death by
his Father, and so made a curse, or an anathema, for us; he submitted
himself, as she did, to his Father's will: Not as I will, but as thou
wilt. But, \[2.\] Most condemn Jephthah; he did ill to make so rash a
vow, and worse to perform it. He could not be bound by his vow to that
which God had forbidden by the letter of the sixth commandment: Thou
shalt not kill. God had forbidden human sacrifices, so that it was (says
Dr. Lightfoot) in effect a sacrifice to Moloch. And, probably, the
reason why it is left dubious by the inspired penman whether he
sacrificed her or no was that those who did afterwards offer their
children might not take any encouragement from this instance. Concerning
this and some other such passages in the sacred story, which learned men
are in the dark, divided, and in doubt about, we need not much perplex
ourselves; what is necessary to our salvation, thanks be to God, is
plain enough.
