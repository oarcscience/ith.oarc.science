### [Exodus Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 5:0</span></span>

Moses and Aaron are here dealing with Pharaoh, to get leave of him to go
and worship in the wilderness. I. They demand leave in the name of God
([Exo 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#001).md), and he answers their
demand with a defiance of God ([Exo
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#002).md). II. They beg leave in the name
of Israel ([Exo 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#003).md), and he answers
their request with further orders to oppress Israel ([Exo
5:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#004).md). These cruel orders were, 1.
Executed by the task-masters ([Exo
5:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#010).md). 2. Complained of to Pharaoh,
but in vain ([Exo 5:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#015).md). 3.
Complained of by the people to Moses ([Exo
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#020.md), [Exo
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#021).md), and by him to God ([Exo
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#022.md), [Exo
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#023).md).

[Exodus 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 5:1</span></span>

Moses and Aaron, having delivered their message to the elders of Israel,
with whom they found good acceptance, are now to deal with Pharaoh, to
whom they come in peril of their lives - Moses particularly, who perhaps
was out-lawed for killing the Egyptian forty years before, so that if
any of the old courtiers should happen to remember that against him now
it might cost him his head. Their message itself was displeasing, and
touch Pharaoh both in his honour and in his profit, two tender points;
yet these faithful ambassadors boldly deliver it, whether he will hear
or whether he will forbear.

I. Their demand is piously bold: Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Let
my people go, [Exo 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#001.md). Moses, in
treating with the elders of Israel, is directed to call God the God of
their fathers; but, in treating with Pharaoh, they call him the God of
Israel, and it is the first time we find him called so in scripture: he
is called the God of Israel, the person ([Gen
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#020).md); but here it is Israel, the
people. They are just beginning to be formed into a people when God is
called their God. Moses, it is likely, was directed to call him so, at
least it might be inferred from [Exo
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#022.md), Israel is my son. In this great
name they deliver their message: Let my people go. 1. They were God's
people, and therefore Pharaoh ought not to detain them in bondage. Note,
God will own his own people, though ever so poor and despicable, and
will find a time to plead their cause. "The Israelites are slaves in
Egypt, but they are my people," says God, "and I will not suffer them to
be always trampled upon." See [Isa
52:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#004.md), [Isa
52:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#005.md). 2. He expected services and
sacrifices from them, and therefore they must have leave to go where
they could freely exercise their religion, without giving offence to, or
receiving offence from, the Egyptians. Note, God delivers his people out
of the hand of their enemies, that they may serve him, and serve him
cheerfully, that they may hold a feast to him, which they may do, while
they have his favour and presence, even in a wilderness, a dry and
barren land.

II\. Pharaoh's answer is impiously bold: Who is the Lord, that I should
obey his voice? [Exo 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#002.md). Being
summoned to surrender, he thus hangs out the flag of defiance, hectors
Moses and the God that sends him, and peremptorily refuses to let Israel
go; he will not treat about it, nor so much as bear the mention of it.
Observe, 1. How scornfully he speaks of the God of Israel: "Who is
Jehovah? I neither know him nor care for him, neither value him nor fear
him:" it is a hard name that he never heard of before, but he resolves
it shall be no bug-bear to him. Israel was now a despised oppressed
people, looked on as the tail of the nation, and, by the character they
bore, Pharaoh makes his estimate of their God, and concludes that he
made no better a figure among the gods than his people did among the
nations. Note, Hardened persecutors are more malicious against God
himself than they are against his people. See [Isa
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#023.md). Again, Ignorance and contempt
of God are at the bottom of all the wickedness that is in the world. Men
know not the Lord, or have very low and mean thoughts of him, and
therefore they obey not his voice, nor will let any thing go for him. 2.
How proudly he speaks of himself: "That I should obey his voice; I, the
king of Egypt, a great people, obey the God of Israel, a poor enslaved
people? Shall I, that rule the Israel of God, obey the God of Israel?
No, it is below me; I scorn to answer his summons." Note, Those are the
children of pride that are the children of disobedience, [Job
41:34](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#034.md); [Eph
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#006.md). Proud men think themselves too
good to stoop even to God himself, and would not be under control, [Jer
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#002.md). Here is the core of the
controversy: God must rule, but man will not be ruled. "I will have my
will done," says God: "But I will do my own will," says the sinner. 3.
How resolutely he denies the demand: Neither will I let Israel go. Note,
Of all sinners none are so obstinate, nor so hardly persuaded to leave
their sin, as persecutors are.

[Exodus 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 5:3</span></span>

Finding that Pharaoh had no veneration at all for God, Moses and Aaron
next try whether he had any compassion for Israel, and become humble
suitors to him for leave to go and sacrifice, but in vain.

I. Their request is very humble and modest, [Exo
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#003.md). They make no complaint of the
rigour they were ruled with. They plead that the journey they designed
was not a project formed among themselves, but that their God had met
with them, and called them to it. They beg with all submission: We pray
thee. The poor useth entreaties; though God may summon princes that
oppress, it becomes us to beseech and make supplication to them. What
they ask is very reasonable, only for a short vacation, while they went
three days' journey into the desert, and that on a good errand, and
unexceptionable: "We will sacrifice unto the Lord our God, as other
people do to theirs;" and, lastly, they give a very good reason, "Lest,
if we quite cast off his worship, he fall upon us with one judgment or
other, and then Pharaoh will lose his vassals."

II\. Pharaoh's denial of their request is very barbarous and
unreasonable, [Exo 5:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#004.md).

1\. His suggestions were very unreasonable. (1.) That the people were
idle, and that therefore they talked of going to sacrifice. The cities
they built for Pharaoh, and the other fruit of their labours, were
witnesses for them that they were not idle; yet he thus basely
misrepresents them, that he might have a pretence to increase their
burdens. (2.) That Moses and Aaron made them idle with vain words, [Exo
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#009.md). God's words are here called vain
words; and those that called them to the best and most needful business
are accused of making them idle. Note, The malice of Satan has often
represented the service and worship of God as fit employment for those
only that have nothing else to do, and the business only of the idle;
whereas indeed it is the indispensable duty of those that are most busy
in the world.

2\. His resolutions hereupon were most barbarous. (1.) Moses and Aaron
themselves must get to their burdens ([Exo
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#004).md); they are Israelites, and,
however God had distinguished them from the rest, Pharaoh makes no
difference: they must share in the common slavery of their nation.
Persecutors have always taken a particular pleasure in putting contempt
and hardship upon the ministers of the churches. (2.) The usual tale of
bricks must be exacted, without the usual allowance of straw to mix with
the clay, or to burn the bricks with, that thus more work might be laid
upon the men, which if they performed, they would be broken with labour;
and, if not, they would be exposed to punishment.

[Exodus 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 5:10</span></span>

Pharaoh's orders are here put in execution; straw is denied, and yet the
work not diminished. 1. The Egyptian task-masters were very severe.
Pharaoh having decreed unrighteous decrees, the task-masters were ready
to write the grievousness that he had prescribed, [Isa
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#001.md). Cruel princes will never want
cruel instruments to be employed under them, who will justify them in
that which is most unreasonable. These task-masters insisted upon the
daily tasks, as when there was straw, [Exo
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#013.md). See what need we have to pray
that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men, [Th2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#002.md). The enmity of the serpent's seed
against the seed of the woman is such as breaks through all the laws of
reason, honour, humanity, and common justice. 2. The people hereby were
dispersed throughout all the land of Egypt, to gather stubble, [Exo
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#012.md). By this means Pharaoh's unjust
and barbarous usage of them came to be known to all the kingdom, and
perhaps caused them to be pitied by their neighbours, and made Pharaoh's
government less acceptable even to his own subjects: good-will is never
got by persecution. 3. The Israelite-officers were used with particular
harshness, [Exo 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#014.md). Those that were
the fathers of the houses of Israel paid dearly for their honour; for
from them immediately the service was exacted, and they were beaten when
it was not performed. See here, (1.) What a miserable thing slavery is,
and what reason we have to be thankful to God that we are a free people,
and not oppressed. Liberty and property are valuable jewels in the eyes
of those whose services and possessions lie at the mercy of an arbitrary
power. (2.) What disappointments we often meet with after the raising of
our expectations. The Israelites were now lately encouraged to hope for
enlargement, but behold greater distresses. This teaches us always to
rejoice with trembling. (3.) What strange steps God sometimes takes in
delivering his people; he often brings them to the utmost straits when
he is just ready to appear for them. The lowest ebbs go before the
highest tides; and very cloudy mornings commonly introduce the fairest
days, [Deu 32:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036.md). God's time to help
is when things are at the worst; and Providence verifies the paradox,
The worse the better.

[Exodus 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 5:15</span></span>

It was a great strait that the head-workmen were in, when they must
either abuse those that were under them or be abused by those that were
over them; yet, it should seem, rather than they would tyrannize, they
would be tyrannized over; and they were so. In this evil case ([Exo
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#019).md), observe,

I. How justly they complained to Pharaoh: They came and cried unto
Pharaoh, [Exo 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#015.md). Whither should
they go with a remonstrance of their grievances but to the supreme
power, which is ordained for the protection of the injured? As bad as
Pharaoh was his oppressed subjects had liberty to complain to him; there
was no law against petitioning: it was a very modest, but moving,
representation that they made of their condition ([Exo
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#016).md): Thy servants are beaten
(severely enough, no doubt, when things were in such a ferment), and yet
the fault is in thy own people, the task-masters, who deny us what is
necessary for carrying on our work. Note, It is common for those to be
most rigorous in blaming others who are most blameworthy themselves. But
what did they get by this complaint? It did but make bad worse. 1.
Pharaoh taunted them ([Exo 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#017).md); when
they were almost killed with working, he told them they were idle: they
underwent the fatigue of industry, and yet lay under the imputation of
slothfulness, while nothing appeared to ground the charge upon but this,
that they said, Let us go and do sacrifice. Note, It is common for the
best actions to be mentioned under the worst names; holy diligence in
the best business is censured by many as a culpable carelessness in the
business of the world. It is well for us that men are not to be our
judges, but a God who knows what the principles are on which we act.
Those that are diligent in doing sacrifice to the Lord will, with God,
escape the doom of the slothful servant, though, with men, they do not.
2. He bound on their burdens: Go now and work. [Exo
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#018.md). Note, Wickedness proceedeth from
the wicked; what can be expected from unrighteous men but more
unrighteousness?

II\. How unjustly they complained of Moses and Aaron: The Lord look upon
you, and judge, [Exo 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#021.md). This was
not fair. Moses and Aaron had given sufficient evidence of their hearty
good-will to the liberties of Israel; and yet, because things succeed
not immediately as they hoped, they are reproached as accessaries to
their slavery. They should have humbled themselves before God, and taken
to themselves the shame of their sin, which turned away good things from
them; but, instead of this, they fly in the face of their best friends,
and quarrel with the instruments of their deliverance, because of some
little difficulties and obstructions they met with in effecting it.
Note, Those that are called out to public service for God and their
generation must expect to be tried, not only by the malicious threats of
proud enemies, but by the unjust and unkind censures of unthinking
friends, who judge only by outward appearance and look but a little way
before them. Now what did Moses do in this strait? It grieved him to the
heart that the event did not answer, but rather contradict, his
expectation; and their upbraidings were very cutting, and like a sword
in his bones; but, 1. He returned to the Lord ([Exo
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#022).md), to acquaint him with it, and to
represent the case to him: he knew that what he had said and done was by
divine direction; and therefore what blame is laid upon him for it he
considers as reflecting upon God, and, like Hezekiah, spreads it before
him as interested in the cause, and appeals to him. Compare this with
[Jer 20:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007.md). Note, When we find
ourselves, at any time, perplexed and embarrassed in the way of our
duty, we ought to have recourse to God, and lay open our case before him
by faithful and fervent prayer. If we retreat, let us retreat to him,
and no further. 2. He expostulated with him, [Exo
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#022.md), [Exo
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#023.md). He knew not how to reconcile the
providence with the promise and the commission which he had received.
"Is this God's coming down to deliver Israel? Must I, who hoped to be a
blessing to them, become a scourge to them? By this attempt to get them
out of the pit, they are but sunk the deeper into it." Now he asks, (1.)
Wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? Note, Even when God
is coming towards his people in ways of mercy, he sometimes takes such
methods as that they may think themselves but ill treated. The
instruments of deliverance, when they aim to help, are found to hinder,
and that becomes a trap which, it was hoped, would have been for their
welfare, God suffering it to be so that we may learn to cease from man,
and may come off from a dependence upon second causes. Note, further,
When the people of God think themselves ill treated, they should go to
God by prayer, and plead with him, and that is the way to have better
treatment in God's good time. (2.) Why is it thou hast sent me? Thus,
\[1.\] He complains of his ill success: "Pharaoh has done evil to this
people, and not one step seems to be taken towards their deliverance."
Note, It cannot but sit very heavily upon the spirits of those whom God
employs for him to see that their labour does no good, and much more to
see that it does hurt eventually, though not designedly. It is
uncomfortable to a good minister to perceive that his endeavours for
men's conviction and conversion do but exasperate their corruptions,
confirm their prejudices, harden their hearts, and seal them up under
unbelief. This makes them go in the bitterness of their souls, as the
prophet, [Eze 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#014.md). Or, \[2.\] He
enquires what was further to be done: Why hast thou sent me? that is,
"What other method shall I take in pursuance of my commission?" Note,
Disappointments in our work must not drive us from our God, but still we
must consider why we are sent.
