An Exposition, with Practical Observations, of The Prophecy of Micah

We shall have some account of this prophet in the first verse of the
book of his prophecy; and therefore shall here only observe that, being
contemporary with the prophet Isaiah (only that he began to prophesy a
little after him), there is a near resemblance between that prophet's
prophecy and this; and there is a prediction of the advancement and
establishment of the gospel-church, which both of them have, almost in
the same words, that out of the mouth of two such witnesses so great a
word might be established. Compare [Isa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002), [Isa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003), with [Mic
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001), [Mic
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#002). Isaiah's prophecy is said to be
concerning Judah and Jerusalem, but Micah's concerning Samaria and
Jerusalem; for, though this prophecy be dated only by the reigns of the
kings of Judah, yet it refers to the kingdom of Israel, the approaching
ruin of which, in the captivity of the ten tribes, he plainly foretels
and sadly laments. What we find here in writing was but an abstract of
the sermons he preached during the reigns of three kings. The scope of
the whole is, I. To convince sinners of their sins, by setting them in
order before them, charging both Israel and Judah with idolatry,
covetousness, oppression, contempt of the word of God, and their rulers
especially, both in church and state, with the abuse of their power; and
also by showing them the judgments of God ready to break in upon them
for their sins. II. To comfort God's people with promises of mercy and
deliverance, especially with an assurance of the coming of the Messiah
and of the grace of the gospel through him. It is remarkable concerning
this prophecy, and confirms its authority, that we find two quotations
out of it made publicly upon very solemn occasions, and both referring
to very great events. 1. One is a prediction of the destruction of
Jerusalem ([Mic 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012)), which we find
quoted in the Old Testament, by the elders of the land ([Jer
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#017), [Jer
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018)), in justification of Jeremiah,
when he foretold the judgments of God coming upon Jerusalem, and to stay
the proceedings of the court against him. "Micah (say they) foretold
that Zion should be ploughed as a field, and Hezekiah did not put him to
death; why then should we punish Jeremiah for saying the same?" 2.
Another is a prediction of the birth of Christ ([Mic
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002)) which we find quoted in the New
Testament, by the chief priests and scribes of the people, in answer to
Herod's enquiry, where Christ should be born ([Mat
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#005), [Mat
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#006)); for still we find that to him
bear all the prophets witness.
