### [Ezra Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001.md)

In this chapter we have, I. The proclamation which Cyrus, king of
Persia, issued out for the release of all the Jews that he found
captives in Babylon, and the building of their temple in Jerusalem ([Ezr
1:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001).md). II. The return of many
thereupon ([Ezr 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#005.md), [Ezr
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#006).md). III. Orders given for the
restoring of the vessels of the temple ([Ezr
1:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#007).md). And this is the dawning of
the day of their deliverance.

[Ezra 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 1:1</span></span>

It will be proper for us here to consider, 1. What was the state of the
captive Jews in Babylon. It was upon many accounts very deplorable; they
were under the power of those that hated them, had nothing they could
call their own; they had no temple, no altar; if they sang psalms, their
enemies ridiculed them; and yet they had prophets among them. Ezekiel
and Daniel were kept distinct from the heathen. Some of them were
preferred at court, others had comfortable settlements in the country,
and they were all borne up with hope that, in due time, they should
return to their own land again, in expectation of which they preserved
among them the distinction of their families, the knowledge of their
religion, and an aversion to idolatry. 2. What was the state of the
government under which they were. Nebuchadnezzar carried many of them
into captivity in the first year of his reign, which was the fourth of
Jehoiakim; he reigned forty-five years, his son Evil-merodach
twenty-three, and his grandson Belshazzar three years, which make up the
seventy years. So Dr. Lightfoot, It is charged upon Nebuchadnezzar that
he opened not the house of his prisoners, [Isa
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#017.md). And, if he had shown mercy to
the poor Jews, Daniel told him it would have been the lengthening of his
tranquillity, [Dan 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#027.md). But the
measure of the sins of Babylon was at length full, and then destruction
was brought upon them by Darius the Mede and Cyrus the Persian, which we
read of, Dan. 5. Darius, being old, left the government to Cyrus, and he
was employed as the instrument of the Jews' deliverance, which he gave
orders for as soon as ever he was master of the kingdom of Babylon,
perhaps in contradiction to Nebuchadnezzar, whose family he had cut off,
and because he took a pleasure in undoing what he had done, or in
policy, to recommend his newly-acquired dominion as merciful and gentle,
or (as some think) in a pious regard to the prophecy of Isaiah, which
had been published, and well known, above 150 years before, where he was
expressly named as the man that should do this for God, and for whom God
would do great things ([Isa 44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028.md);
[Isa 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001), etc..md), and which perhaps
was shown to him by those about him. His name (some say) in the Persian
language signifies the sun, for he brought light and healing to the
church of God, and was an eminent type of Christ the Sun of
righteousness. Some was that his name signifies a father, and Christ is
the everlasting Father. Now here we are told,

I. Whence this proclamation took its rise. The Lord stirred up the
spirit of Cyrus. Note, The hearts of kings are in the hand of the Lord,
and, like the rivulets of water, he turneth them which way soever he
will. It is said of Cyrus that he knew not God, nor how to serve him;
but God knew him, and how to serve himself by him, [Isa
45:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#004.md). God governs the world by his
influence on the spirits of men, and, whatever good is done at any time,
it is God that stirs up the spirit to do it, puts thoughts into the
mind, gives to the understanding to form a right judgment, and directs
the will which way he pleases. Whatever good offices therefore are, at
any time, done for the church of God, he must have the glory of them.

II\. The reference it had to the prophecy of Jeremiah, by whom God had
not only promised that they should return, but had fixed the time, which
set time to favour Sion had now come. Seventy years were determined
([Jer 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md); [Jer
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010).md); and he that kept the promise
made concerning Israel's deliverance out of Egypt to a day ([Exo
12:41](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#041).md) was doubtless as punctual to
this. What Cyrus now did was long since said to be the confirming of the
word of God's servants, [Isa 44:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#026.md).
Jeremiah, while he lived, was hated and despised; yet thus did
Providence honour him long after, that a mighty monarch was influenced
to act in pursuance of the word of the Lord by his mouth.

III\. The date of this proclamation. It was in his first year, not the
first of his reign over Persia, the kingdom he was born to, but the
first of his reign over Babylon, the kingdom he had conquered. Those are
much honoured whose spirits are stirred up to begin with God and to
serve him in their first years.

IV\. The publication of it, both by word of mouth (he caused a voice to
pass throughout all his kingdom, like a jubilee-trumpet, a joyful
sabbatical year after many melancholy ones, proclaiming liberty to the
captives), and also in black and white: he put it in writing, that it
might be the more satisfactory, and might be sent to those distant
provinces where the ten tribes were scattered in Assyria and Media, [Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006.md).

V. The purport of this proclamation of liberty.

1\. The preamble shows the causes and considerations by which he was
influenced, [Ezr 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#002.md). It should seem,
his mind was enlightened with the knowledge of Jehovah (for so he calls
him), the God of Israel, as the only living and true God, the God of
heaven, who is the sovereign Lord and disposer of all the kingdoms of
the earth; of him he says ([Ezr 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#003).md),
He is the God, God alone, God above all. Though he had not known God by
education, God made him so far to know him now as that he did this
service with an eye to him. He professes that he does it, (1.) In
gratitude to God for the favours he had bestowed upon him: The God of
heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth. This sounds a little
vain-glorious, for there were many kingdoms of the earth which he had
nothing to do with; but he means that God had given him all that was
given to Nebuchadnezzar, whose dominion, Daniel says, was to the end of
the earth, [Dan 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#022.md); [Dan
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#019.md). Note, God is the fountain of
power; the kingdoms of the earth are at his disposal; whatever share any
have of them they have from him: and those whom God has entrusted with
great power and large possessions should look upon themselves as obliged
thereby to do much for him. (2.) In obedience to God. He hat charged me
to build him a house at Jerusalem; probably by a dream or vision of the
night, confirmed by comparing it with the prophecy of Isaiah, where his
doing it was foretold. Israel's disobedience to God's charge, which they
were often told of, is aggravated by the obedience of this heathen king.

2\. He gives free leave to all the Jews that were in his dominions to go
up to Jerusalem, and to build the temple of the Lord there, [Ezr
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#003.md). His regard to God made him
overlook, (1.) The secular interest of his government. It would have
been his policy to keep so great a number of serviceable men in his
dominions, and seemed impolitic to let them go and take root again in
their own land; but piety is the best policy. (2.) The honour of the
religion of his country. Why did he not order them to build a temple to
the gods of Babylon or Persia? He believed the God of Israel to be the
God of heaven, and therefore obliged his Israel to worship him only. Let
them walk in the name of the Lord their God.

3\. He subjoins a brief for a collection to bear the charges of such as
were poor and not able to bear their own, [Ezr
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#004.md). "Whosoever remaineth, because he
has not the means to bear his charges to Jerusalem, let the men of his
place help him." Some take it as an order to the king's officers to
supply them out of his revenue, as [Ezr
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#008.md). But it may mean a warrant to the
captives to ask and receive the alms and charitable contributions of all
the king's loving subjects. And we may suppose the Jews had conducted
themselves so well among their neighbours that they would be as forward
to accommodate them because they loved them as the Egyptians were
because they were weary of them. At least many would be kind to them
because they saw the government would take it well. Cyrus not only gave
his good wishes with those that went (Their God be with them, [Ezr
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#003).md), but took care also to furnish
them with such things as they needed. He took it for granted that those
among them who were of ability would offer their free-will offerings for
the house of God, to promote the rebuilding of it. But, besides that, he
would have them supplied out of his kingdom. Well-wishers to the temple
should be well-doers for it.

[Ezra 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ezr 1:5</span></span>

We are here told,

I. How Cyrus's proclamation succeeded with others. 1. He having given
leave to the Jews to go up to Jerusalem, many of them went up
accordingly, [Ezr 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#005.md). The leaders
herein were the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, eminent and
experienced men, from whom it might justly be expected that, as they
were above their brethren in dignity, so they should go before them in
duty. The priests and Levites were (as became them) with the first that
set their faces again towards Zion. If any good work is to be done, let
ministers lead in it. Those that accompanied them were such as God had
inclined to go up. The same God that had raised up the spirit of Cyrus
to proclaim this liberty raised up their spirits to take the benefit of
it; for it was done, not by might, nor by power, but by the Spirit of
the Lord of hosts, [Zac 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006.md). The
temptation perhaps was strong to some of them to stay in Babylon. They
had convenient settlements there, had contracted an agreeable
acquaintance with the neighbours, and were ready to say, It is good to
be here. The discouragements of their return were many and great, the
journey long, their wives and children unfit for travelling, their own
land was to them a strange land, the road to it an unknown road. Go up
to Jerusalem! And what should they do there? It was all in ruins, and in
the midst of enemies to whom they would be an easy prey. Many were
wrought upon by these considerations to stay in Babylon, at least not to
go with the first. But there were some that got over these difficulties,
that ventured to break the ice, and feared not the lion in the way, the
lion in the streets; and they were those whose spirits God raised. He,
by his Spirit and grace, filled them with a generous ambition of
liberty, a gracious affection to their own land, and a desire of the
free and public exercise of their religion. Had God left them to
themselves, and to the counsels of flesh and blood, they would have
staid in Babylon; but he put it into their hearts to set their faces
Zionward, and, as strangers, to ask the way thither ([Jer
50:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#005).md); for they, being a new
generation, went out like their father Abraham from this land of the
Chaldees, not knowing whither they went, [Heb
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#008.md). Note, Whatever good we do, it is
owing purely to the grace of God, and he raises up our spirits to the
doing of it, works in us both to will and to do. Our spirits naturally
incline to this earth and to the things of it. If they move upwards, in
any good affections or good actions, it is God that raises them. The
call and offer of the gospel are like Cyrus's proclamation. Deliverance
is preached to the captives, [Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md). Those that are bound under the
unrighteous dominion of sin, and bound over to the righteous judgment of
God, may be made free by Jesus Christ. Whoever will, by repentance and
faith, return to God, his duty to God, his happiness in God, Jesus
Christ has opened the way for him, and let him go up out of the slavery
of sin into the glorious liberty of the children of God. The offer is
general to all. Christ makes it, in pursuance of the grant which the
Father has made him of all power both in heaven and in earth (a much
greater dominion than that given to Cyrus, [Ezr
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#002).md) and of the charge given him to
build God a house, to set him up a church in the world, a kingdom among
men. Many that hear this joyful sound choose to sit still in Babylon,
are in love with their sins and will not venture upon the difficulties
of a holy life; but some there are that break through the
discouragements, and resolve to build the house of God, to make heaven
of their religion, whatever it cost them, and they are those whose
spirit God has raised above the world and the flesh and whom he has made
willing in the day of his power, [Psa
110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md). Thus will the heavenly Canaan
be replenished, though many perish in Babylon; and the gospel-offer will
not be made in vain. 2. Cyrus having given order that their neighbours
should help them, they did so, [Ezr
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#006.md). All those that were about them
furnished them with plate and goods to bear the charges of their
journey, and to help them in building and furnishing both their own
houses and God's temple. As the tabernacle was made of the spoils of
Egypt, and the first temple built by the labours of the strangers, so
the second by the contributions of the Chaldeans, all intimating the
admission of the Gentiles into the church in due time. God can, where he
pleases, incline the hearts of strangers to be kind to his people, and
make those to strengthen their hands that have weakened them. The earth
helped the woman. Besides what was willingly offered by the Jews
themselves who staid behind, from a principle of love to God and his
house, much was offered, as one may say, unwillingly by the Babylonians,
who were influenced to do it by a divine power on their minds of which
they themselves could give no account.

How this proclamation was seconded by Cyrus himself. To give proof of
the sincerity of his affection to the house of God, he not only released
the people of God, but restored the vessels of the temple, [Ezr
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#007.md), [Ezr
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#008.md). Observe here, 1. How careful
Providence was of the vessels of the temple, that they were not lost,
melted down, or so mixed with other vessels that they could not be
known, but that they were all now forthcoming. Such care God has of the
living vessels of mercy, vessels of honour, of whom it is said ([Ti2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019.md), [Ti2
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#020).md), The Lord knows those that are
his, and they shall none of them perish. 2. Though they had been put
into an idol's temple, and probably used in the service of idols, yet
they were given back, to be used for God. God will recover his own; and
the spoil of the strong man armed shall be converted to the use of the
conqueror. 3. Judah had a prince, even in captivity. Sheshbazzar,
supposed to be the same with Zerubbabel, is here called prince of Judah;
the Chaldeans called him Sheshbazzar, which signifies joy in
tribulation; but among his own people he went by the name of Zerubbabel
- a stranger in Babylon; so he looked upon himself, and considered
Jerusalem his home, though, as Josephus says, he was captain of the
life-guard to the king of Babylon. He took care of the affairs of the
Jews, and had some authority over them, probably from the death of
Jehoiachin, or Jeconiah, who made him his heir, he being of the house of
David. 4. To him the sacred vessels were numbered out ([Ezr
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#008).md), and he took care for their safe
conveyance to Jerusalem, [Ezr 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#011.md). It
would encourage them to build the temple that they had so much rich
furniture ready to put into it when it was built. Though God's
ordinances, like the vessels of the sanctuary, may be corrupted and
profaned by the New Testament Babylon, they shall, in due time, be
restored to their primitive use and intention; for not one jot or tittle
of divine institution shall fall to the ground.
