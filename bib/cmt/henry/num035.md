### [Numbers Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 35:0</span></span>

Orders having been given before for the dividing of the land of Canaan
among the lay-tribes (as I may call them), care is here taken for a
competent provision for the clergy, the tribe of Levi, which ministered
in holy things. I. Forty-eight cities were to be assigned them, with
their suburbs, some in every tribe ([Num
35:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#001).md). II. Six cities out of these
were to be for cities of refuge, for any man that killed another
unawares ([Num 35:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#009).md). In the law
concerning these observe, 1. In what case sanctuary was not allowed,
namely, that of wilful murder ([Num
35:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#016).md). 2. In what cases it was
allowed ([Num 35:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#022).md). 3. What was
the law concerning those that took shelter in these cities of refuge
([Num 35:25](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#025), etc..md).

[Numbers 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 35:1</span></span>

The laws about the tithes and offerings had provided very plentifully
for the maintenance of the Levites, but it was not to be thought, nor
indeed was it for the public good, that when they came to Canaan they
should all live about the tabernacle, as they had done in the
wilderness, and therefore care must be taken to provide habitations for
them, in which they might live comfortably and usefully. It is this
which is here taken care of.

I. Cities were allotted them, with their suburbs, [Num
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#002.md). They were not to have any ground
for tillage; they needed not to sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns,
for their heavenly Father fed them with the tithe of the increase of
other people's labours, that they might the more closely attend to the
study of the law, and might have more leisure to teach the people; for
they were not fed thus easily that they might live in idleness, but that
they might give themselves wholly to the business of their profession,
and not be entangled in the affairs of this life. 1. Cities were
allotted them, that they might live near together, and converse with one
another about the law, to their mutual edification; and that in doubtful
cases they might consult one another, and in all cases strengthen one
another's hands. 2. These cities had suburbs annexed to them for their
cattle ([Num 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#003).md), a thousand cubits
from the wall was allowed them for out-houses to keep their cattle in,
and then two thousand more for fields to graze their cattle in, [Num
35:4](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#004.md), [Num
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#005.md). Thus was care taken that they
should not only live, but live plentifully, and have all desirable
conveniences about them, that they might not be looked upon with
contempt by their neighbours.

II\. These cities were to be assigned them out of the possessions of
each tribe, [Num 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#008.md). 1. That each
tribe might thus make a grateful acknowledgment to God out of their real
as well as out of their personal estates (for what was given to the
Levites was accepted as given to the Lord) and thus their possessions
were sanctified to them. 2. That each tribe might have the benefit of
the Levites' dwelling among them, to teach them the good knowledge of
the Lord; thus that light was diffused through all parts of the country,
and none were left to sit in darkness, [Deu
33:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#010.md), They shall teach Jacob thy
judgments. Jacob's curse on Levi's anger was, I will scatter them in
Israel, [Gen 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#007.md). But that curse was
turned into a blessing, and the Levites, by being thus scattered, were
put into a capacity of doing so much the more good. It is a great mercy
to a country to be replenished in all parts with faithful ministers.

III\. The number allotted them was forty-eight in all, four out of each
of the twelve tribes, one with another. Out of the united tribes of
Simeon and Judah nine, out of Naphtali three, and four apiece out of the
rest, as appears, Jos. 21. Thus were they blessed with a good ministry,
and that ministry with a comfortable maintenance, not only in tithes,
but in glebe-lands. And, though the gospel is not so particular as the
law was in this matter, yet it expressly provides that he that is taught
in the word should communicate unto him that teaches in all good things,
[Gal 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#006.md).

[Numbers 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 35:9</span></span>

We have here the orders given concerning the cities of refuge, fitly
annexed to what goes before, because they were all Levites' cities. In
this part of the constitution there is a great deal both of good law and
pure gospel.

I. Here is a great deal of good law, in the case of murder and
manslaughter, a case of which the laws of all nations have taken
particular cognizance. It is here enacted and provided, consonant to
natural equity,

1\. That wilful murder should be punished with death, and in that case
no sanctuary should be allowed, no ransom taken, nor any commutation of
the punishment accepted: The murderer shall surely be put to death, [Num
35:16](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#016.md). It is supposed to be done of
hatred ([Num 35:20](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#020).md), or in enmity
([Num 35:21](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#021).md), upon a sudden
provocation (for our Saviour makes rash anger, as well as malice
prepense, to be murder, [Mat 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#021.md),
[Mat 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022).md), whether the person be
murdered with an instrument of iron ([Num
35:16](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#016).md) or wood ([Num
35:18](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#018).md), or with a stone thrown at him
([Num 35:17](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#017.md), [Num
35:20](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#020).md); nay, if he smite him with his
hand in enmity, and death ensue, it is murder ([Num
35:21](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#021).md); and it was an ancient law,
consonant to the law of nature, that whoso sheds man's blood, by man
shall his blood be shed, [Gen 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006.md).
Where wrong has been done restitution must be made; and, since the
murderer cannot restore the life he has wrongfully taken away, his own
must be exacted from him in lieu of it, not (as some have fancied) to
satisfy the manes or ghost of the person slain, but to satisfy the law
and the justice of a nation; and to be a warning to all others not to do
likewise. It is here said, and it is well worthy the consideration of
all princes and states, that blood defiles not only the conscience of
the murderer, who is thereby proved not to have eternal life abiding in
him ([Jo1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#015).md), but also the land in
which it is shed; so very offensive is it to God and all good men, and
the worst of nuisances. And it is added that the land cannot be cleansed
from the blood of the murdered, but by the blood of the murderer, [Num
35:33](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#033.md). If murderers escape punishment
from men, those that suffer them to escape will have a great deal to
answer for, and God will nevertheless not suffer them to escape his
righteous judgments. Upon the same principle it is provided that no
satisfaction should be taken for the life of a murderer ([Num
35:31](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#031).md): If a man would give all the
substance of his house to the judges, to the country, or to the avenger
of blood, to atone for his crime, it must utterly be contemned. The
redemption of the life is so precious that it cannot be obtained by the
multitude of riches ([Psa 49:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#006).md),
which perhaps may allude to this law. A rule of law comes in here (which
is a rule of our law in cases of treason only) that no man shall be put
to death upon the testimony of one witness, but it was necessary there
should be two ([Num 35:30](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#030).md); this law
is settled in all capital cases, [Deu
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#006.md); [Deu
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015.md). And, lastly, not only the
prosecution, but the execution, of the murderer, is committed to the
next of kin, who, as he was to be the redeemer of his kinsman's estate
if it were mortgaged, so he was to be the avenger of his blood if he
were murdered ([Num 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#019).md): The
avenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer, if he be convicted by
the notorious evidence of the fact, and he needed not to have recourse
by a judicial process to the court of judgment. But if it were uncertain
who the murderer was, and the proof doubtful, we cannot think that his
bare suspicion, or surmise, would empower him to do that which the
judges themselves could not do but upon the testimony of two witnesses.
Only if the fact were plain then the next heir of the person slain might
himself, in a just indignation, slay the murderer wherever he met him.
Some think this must be understood to be after the lawful judgment of
the magistrate, and so the Chaldee says, "He shall slay him, when he
shall be condemned unto him by judgment;" but it should seem, by [Num
35:24](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#024.md), that the judges interposed only
in a doubtful case, and that if the person on whom he took vengeance was
indeed the murderer, and a wilful murderer, the avenger was innocent
([Num 35:27](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#027).md), only, if it proved
otherwise, it was at his peril. Our law allows an appeal to be brought
against a murderer by the widow, or next heir, of the person murdered,
yea, though the murderer have been acquitted upon an indictment; and, if
the murderer be found guilty upon that appeal, execution shall be
awarded at the suit of the appellant, who may properly be called the
avenger of blood.

2\. But if the homicide was not voluntary, nor done designedly, if it
was without enmity, or lying in wait ([Num
35:22](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#022).md), not seeing the person or not
seeking his harm ([Num 35:23](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#023).md), which
our law calls chance-medley, or homicide per infortunium - through
misfortune, in this case there were cities of refuge appointed for the
manslayer to flee to. By our law this incurs a forfeiture of goods, but
a pardon is granted of course upon the special matter found. Concerning
the cities of refuge the law was, (1.) That, if a man killed another, in
these cities he was safe, and under the protection of the law, till he
had his trial before the congregation, that is, before the judges in
open court. If he neglected thus to surrender himself, it was at his
peril; if the avenger of blood met him elsewhere, or overtook him
loitering in his way to the city of refuge, and slew him, his blood was
upon his own head, because he did not make use of the security which God
had provided for him. (2.) If, upon trial, it were found to be willful
murder, the city of refuge should no longer be a protection to him; it
was already determined: Thou shalt take him from my altar, that he may
die, [Exo 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#014). (3..md) But if it were
found to be by error or accident, and that the stroke was given without
any design upon the life of the person slain or any other, then the
man-slayer should continue safe in the city of refuge, and the avenger
of blood might not meddle with him, [Num
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#025.md). There he was to remain in
banishment from his own house and patrimony till the death of the high
priest; and, if at any time he went out of that city or the suburbs of
it, he put himself out of the protection of the law, and the avenger of
blood, if he met him, might slay him, [Num
35:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#026.md). Now, \[1.\] By the
preservation of the life of the man-slayer God would teach us that men
ought not to suffer for that which is rather their unhappiness than
their crime, rather the act of Providence than their own act, for God
delivered him into his hand, [Exo
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#013.md). \[2.\] By the banishment of the
man-slayer from his own city, and his confinement to the city of refuge,
where he was in a manner a prisoner, God would teach us to conceive a
dread and horror of the guilt of blood, and to be very careful of life,
and always afraid lest by oversight or negligence we occasion the death
of any. \[3.\] By the limiting of the time of the offender's banishment
to the death of the high priest, an honour was put upon that sacred
office. The high priest was to be looked upon as so great a blessing to
his country that when he died their sorrow upon that occasion should
swallow up all other resentments. The cities of refuge being all of them
Levites' cities, and the high priest being the head of that tribe, and
consequently having a peculiar dominion over these cites, those that
were confined to them might properly be looked upon as his prisoners,
and so his death must be their discharge; it was, as it were, at his
suit that the delinquent was imprisoned, and therefore at his death it
fell. Actio moritur cum persona - The suit expires with the party.
Anisworth has another notion of it, That as the high priests, while they
lived, by their service and sacrificing made atonement for sin, wherein
they prefigured Christ's satisfaction, so, at their death, those were
released that had been exiled for casual murder, which typified
redemption in Israel. \[4.\] By the abandoning of the prisoner to the
avenger of blood, in case he at any time went out of the limits of the
city of refuge, they were taught to adhere to the methods which Infinite
Wisdom prescribed for their security. It was for the honour of a
remedial law that it should be so strictly observed. How can we expect
to be saved if we neglect the salvation, which is indeed a great
salvation!

II\. Here is a great deal of good gospel couched under the type and
figure of the cities of refuge; and to them the apostle seems to allude
when he speaks of our fleeing for refuge to the hope set before is ([Heb
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018).md), and being found in Christ, [Phi
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#009.md). We never read in the history of
the Old Testament of any use made of these cities of refuge, any more
than of other such institutions, which yet, no doubt, were made use of
upon the occasions intended; only we read of those that, in dangerous
cases, took hold of the horns of the altar ([Kg1
1:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#050.md); [Kg1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#028).md); for the altar, wherever that
stood, was, as it were the capital city of refuge. But the law
concerning these cities was designed both to raise and to encourage the
expectations of those who looked for redemption in Israel, which should
be to those who were convinced of sin, and in terror by reason of it, as
the cities of refuge were to the man-slayer. Observe, 1. There were
several cities of refuge, and they were so appointed in several parts of
the country that the man-slayer, wherever he dwelt in the land of
Israel, might in half a day reach one or other of them; so, though there
is but one Christ appointed for our refuge, yet, wherever we are, he is
a refuge at hand, a very present help, for the word is nigh us and
Christ in the word. 2. The man-slayer was safe in any of these cities;
so in Christ believers that flee to him, and rest in him, are protected
from the wrath of God and the curse of the law. There is no condemnation
to those that are in Christ Jesus, [Rom
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001.md). Who shall condemn those that are
thus sheltered? 3. They were all Levites' cities; it was a kindness to
the poor prisoner that though he might not go up to the place where the
ark was, yet he was in the midst of Levites, who would teach him the
good knowledge of the Lord, and instruct him how to improve the
providence he was now under. It might also be expected that the Levites
would comfort and encourage him, and bid him welcome; so it is the work
of gospel ministers to bid poor sinners welcome to Christ, and to assist
and counsel those that through grace are in him. 4. Even strangers and
sojourners, though they were not native Israelites, might take the
benefit of these cities of refuge, [Num
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#015.md). So in Christ Jesus no
difference in made between Greek and Jew; even the sons of the stranger
that by faith flee to Christ shall be safe in him. 5. Even the suburbs
or borders of the city were a sufficient security to the offender, [Num
35:26](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#026.md), [Num
35:27](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#027.md). So there is virtue even in the
hem of Christ's garment for the healing and saving of poor sinners. If
we cannot reach to a full assurance, we may comfort ourselves in a good
hope through grace. 6. The protection which the man-slayer found in the
city of refuge was not owing to the strength of its walls, or gates, or
bars, but purely to the divine appointment; so it is the word of the
gospel that gives souls safety in Christ, for him hath God the Father
sealed. 7. If the offender was ever caught struggling out of the borders
of his city of refuge, or stealing home to his house again, he lost the
benefit of his protection, and lay exposed to the avenger of blood; so
those that are in Christ must abide in Christ, for it is at their peril
if they forsake him and wander from him. Drawing back is to perdition.
