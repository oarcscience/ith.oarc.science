### [Ezekiel Chapter 43](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 43:0</span></span>

The prophet, having given us a view of the mystical temple, the
gospel-church, as he received it from the Lord, that it might appear not
to be erected in vain, comes to describe, in this and the next chapter,
the worship that should be performed in it, but under the type of the
Old Testament services. In this chapter we have, I. Possession taken of
this temple, by the glory of God filling it ([Eze
43:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#001).md). II. A promise given of the
continuance of God's presence with his people upon condition of their
return to, and continuance in, the instituted way of worship, and their
abandoning idols and idolatry ([Eze
43:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#007).md). III. A description of the
altar of burnt-offerings ([Eze
43:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#013).md). IV. Directions given for
the consecration of that altar ([Eze
43:18-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#018).md). Ezekiel seems here to stand
between God and Israel, as Moses the servant of the Lord did when the
sanctuary was first set up.

[Ezekiel 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 43:1</span></span>

After Ezekiel has patiently surveyed the temple of God, the greatest
glory of this earth, he is admitted to a higher form, and honoured with
a sight of the glories of the upper world; it is said to him, Come up
hither. He has seen the temple, and sees it to be very spacious and
splendid; but, till the glory of God comes into it, it is but like the
dead bodies he had seen in vision (ch. 37), that had no breath till the
Spirit of life entered into them. Here therefore he sees the house
filled with God's glory.

I. He has a vision of the glory of God ([Eze
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#002).md), the glory of the God of Israel,
that God who is in covenant with Israel, and whom they serve and
worship. The idols of the heathen have no glory but what they owe to the
goldsmith or the painter; but this is the glory of the God of Israel.
This glory came from the way of the east, and therefore he was brought
to the gate that leads towards the east, to expect the appearance and
approach of it. Christ's star was seen in the east, and he is that other
angel that ascends out of the east, [Rev
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#002.md). For he is the morning star, he is
the sun of righteousness. Two things he observed in this appearance of
the glory of God: - 1. The power of his word which he heard: His voice
was like a noise of many waters, which is heard very far, and makes
impressions; the noise of purling streams is grateful, of a roaring sea
dreadful, [Rev 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#015.md); [Rev
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#002.md). Christ's gospel, in the glory of
which he shines, was to be proclaimed aloud, the report of it to be
heard far; to some it is a savour of life, to others of death, according
as they are. 2. The brightness of his appearance which he saw: The earth
shone with his glory; for God is light, and none can bear the lustre of
his light, none has seen nor can see it. Note, That glory of God which
shines in the church shines on the world. When God appeared for David
the brightness that was before him dispersed the clouds, [Psa
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#012.md). This appearance of the glory of
God to Ezekiel he observed to be the same with the vision he saw when he
first received his commission ([Eze
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#004).md), according to that by the river
Chebar ([Eze 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#003).md); because God is the
same, he was pleased to manifest himself in the same manner, for with
him is no variableness. "It was the same" (says he) "as that which I saw
when I came to destroy the city, that is, to foretel the city's
destruction," which he did with such authority and efficacy, and the
event did so certainly answer the prediction, that he might be said to
destroy it. As a judge, in God's name, he passed a sentence upon it,
which was soon executed. God appeared in the same manner when he sent
him to speak words of terror and when he sent him to speak words of
comfort; for in both God is and will be glorified. He kills and he makes
alive; he wounds and he heals, [Deu
32:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#039.md). To the same hand that destroyed
we must look for deliverance. He has smitten, and he will bind up. Una
eademque manus vulnus opemque tulit - The same hand inflicted the wound
and healed it.

II\. He has a vision of the entrance of this glory into the temple. When
he saw this glory he fell upon his face ([Eze
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#003).md), as not able to bear the lustre
of God's glory, or rather as one willing to give him the glory of it by
a humble and reverent adoration. But the Spirit took him up ([Eze
43:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#005).md) when the glory of the Lord had
come into the house ([Eze 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#004).md), that
he might see how the house was filled with it. He saw how the glory of
the Lord in this same appearance departed from the temple, because it
was profaned, to his great grief; now he shall see it return to the
temple to his great satisfaction. See [Eze
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#018.md), [Eze
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#019.md); [Eze
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#023.md). Note, Though God may forsake
his people for a small moment, he will return with everlasting
loving-kindness. God's glory filled the house as it had filled the
tabernacle which Moses set up and the temple of Solomon, [Exo
40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034.md); [Kg1
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#010.md). Now we do not find that ever the
Shechinah did in that manner take possession of the second temple, and
therefore this was to have its accomplishment in that glory of the
divine grace which shines so brightly in the gospel church, and fills
it. Here is no mention of a cloud filling the house as formerly, for we
now with open face behold the glory of the Lord, in the face of Christ,
and not as of old through the cloud of types.

III\. He receives instructions more immediately from the glory of the
Lord, as Moses did when God had taken possession of the tabernacle ([Lev
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001).md): I heard him speaking to me out
of the house, [Eze 43:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#006.md). God's glory
shining in the church, we must thence expect to receive divine oracles.
The man stood by me; we could not bear to hear the voice of God any more
than to see the face of God if Jesus Christ did not stand by us as
Mediator. Or, if this was a created angel, it is observable that when
God began to speak to Ezekiel he stood by and gave way, having no more
to say. Nay, he stood by the prophet, as a learner with him; for to the
principalities and powers, to the angels themselves, who desire to look
into these things, is known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,
[Eph 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010.md). The man stood by him to
conduct him thither where he might receive further discoveries, [Eze
44:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#001.md).

[Ezekiel 43:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 43:7</span></span>

God does here, in effect, renew his covenant with his people Israel,
upon his retaking possession of the house, and Ezekiel negotiates the
matter, as Moses formerly. This would be of great use to the captives at
their return both for direction and encouragement; but it looks further,
to those that are blessed with the privileges of the gospel-temple, that
they may understand how they are before him on their good behaviour.

I. God, by the prophet, puts them in mind of their former provocations,
for which they had long lain under the tokens of his displeasure. This
conviction is spoken to them to make way for the comforts designed them.
Though God gives and upbraids not, it becomes us, when he forgives, to
upbraid ourselves with our unworthy conduct towards him. Let them now
remember therefore, 1. That they had formerly defiled God's holy name,
had profaned and abused all those sacred things by which he had made
himself known among them, [Eze 43:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#007.md).
They and their kings had brought contempt on the religion they
professed, and their relation to God, by their spiritual whoredom, their
idolatry, and by worshipping images, which they called their kings (for
so Moloch signifies) or lords (for so Baal signifies), but which were
really the carcases of kings, not only lifeless and useless, but
loathsome and abominable as dead carcases, in their high places, set up
in honour of them. They had defiled God's name by their abominations.
And what were they? It was in setting their threshold by my thresholds,
and their post by my posts, that is, adding their own inventions to
God's institutions, and urging all to a compliance with them, as if they
had been of equal authority and efficacy, teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men ([Isa 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013).md); or,
rather, setting up altars to their idols even in the courts of the
temple, than which a more impudent affront could not be put upon the
divine Majesty. Thus they set up a separation wall between him and them,
which stopped the current of his favours to them and spoiled the
acceptableness of their services to him. See what an indignity sinners
do to God, setting up their walls in opposition to his, and thrusting
him out from what is his right; and see what injury they do to
themselves, for the nearer any come to God with their sins the further
they set him at a distance from them. Some give this sense of it: Though
their houses joined close to God's house, their posts and thresholds to
hi, so that they were in a manner his next neighbours, there was but a
wall between me and them (so it is in the margin), so that it might have
been expected they would acquaint themselves with him and be in care to
please him, yet they were not so much as neighbourly. Note, It often
proves too true, The nearer the church the further from God. They were,
by profession, in covenant with God, and yet they had defiled the place
of his throne and of the soles of his feet, his temple, where he did
both reside and reign. Jerusalem is called the city of the great king
([Psa 48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002).md) and his footstool, [Psa
99:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#005.md); [Psa
132:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#007.md). Note, When God's ordinances are
profaned his holy name is polluted. 2. That for this God had had a
controversy with them in their late troubles. They could not condemn
him, for he had but brought upon them the desert of their sins:
Wherefore I have consumed them in my anger. Note, Those that pollute
God's holy name fall under his just displeasure.

II\. He calls upon them to repent and reform, and, in order to that, to
be ashamed of their iniquities ([Eze
43:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#009).md): "Now let them put away their
whoredom; now that they have smarted so severely for it, and now that
God is returning in mercy to them and setting up his sanctuary again in
the midst of them, now let them cast away their idols and have no more
to do with them, that they may not again forfeit the privileges which
they have been taught to know the worth of by the want of them. Let them
put away their idols, those loathsome carcases of their kings, far from
me, from being a provocation to me." This was seasonable counsel now
that the prophet had the model or pattern of the temple to set before
them; for, 1. If they see that pattern, they will surely be ashamed of
their sins ([Eze 43:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#010).md): when they see
what mercy God has in store for them, notwithstanding their utter
unworthiness of it, they will be ashamed to think of their disingenuous
conduct towards him. Note, The goodness of God to us should lead us to
repentance, especially to a penitential shame. Let them measure the
pattern themselves, and see how much it exceeds the former pattern, and
guess by that what great things God has in store for them; and surely it
will put them out of countenance to think what the desert of their sins
was. And then, 2. If they be ashamed of their sins, they shall surely
see more of the pattern, [Eze 43:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#011.md).
If they be ashamed of all that they have done, upon a general view of
the goodness of God, let them have a more distinct particular account of
the temple. Note, Those that improve what they see and know of the
goodness of God shall see and know more of it. And then, and not till
then, we are qualified for God's favours, when we are truly humbled for
our own follies. "Show them the form of the house; let them see what a
stately structure it will be; and withal show them the ordinances and
laws of it." Note, With the foresights of our comforts it is fit that we
should get the knowledge of our duty; with the privileges of God's house
we must acquaint ourselves with the rules of it. Show them these
ordinances, that they may keep them and do them. Note, Therefore we are
made to know our duty, that we may do it, and be blessed in our deed.

III\. He promises that they shall be such as they should be, and then he
will be to them such as they would have him to be, [Eze
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#007.md). 1. The house of Israel shall no
more defile my holy name. This is pure gospel. The precept of the law
says, You must not defile my name: the grace of the gospel says, You
shall not. Thus what is required in the covenant is promised in the
covenant, [Jer 32:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#040.md). 2. Then I will
dwell in the midst of them for ever; and the same again [Eze
43:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#009.md). God secures to us his good-will
be confirming in us his good work. If we do not defile his name, we may
be sure that he will not depart from us.

IV\. The general law of God's house is laid down ([Eze
43:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#012).md), That, whereas formerly only
the chancel, or sanctuary, was most holy, now the whole mountain of the
house shall be so; the whole limit thereof, including all the courts and
all the chambers, shall be as the most holy place, signifying that in
gospel-times, 1. The whole church shall have the privilege of the holy
of holies, that of a near access to God. All believers have now, under
the gospel, boldness to enter into the holiest ([Heb
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019).md), with this advantage, that
whereas the high priest entered in the virtue of the blood of bulls and
goats, we enter in the virtue of the blood of Jesus, and, wherever we
are, we have through him access to the Father. 2. The whole church shall
be under a mighty obligation to press towards the perfection of
holiness, as he who has called us is holy. All must now be most holy.
Holiness becomes God's house for ever, and in gospel-times more than
ever. Behold this is the law of the house; let none expect the
protection of it that will not submit to this law.

[Ezekiel 43:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 43:13</span></span>

This relates to the altar in this mystical temple, and that is mystical
too; for Christ is our altar. The Jews, after their return out of
captivity, had an altar long before they had a temple, [Ezr
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#003.md). But this was an altar in the
temple. Now here we have,

I. The measures of the altar, [Eze
43:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#013.md). It was six yards square at the
top and seven yards square at the bottom; it was four yards and a half
high; it had a lower bench or shelf, here called a settle, a yard from
the ground, on which some of the priests stood to minister, and another
two yards above that, on which others of them stood, and these were each
of them half a yard broad, and had ledges on either side, that they
might stand firmly upon them. The sacrifices were killed at the table
spoken of before, [Eze 40:39](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#039.md). What was
to be burnt on the altar was given up to those on the lower bench, and
handed by them to those on the higher, and they laid it on the altar.
Thus in the service of God we must be assistant to one another.

II\. The ordinances of the altar. Directions are here given, 1.
Concerning the dedication of the altar at first. Seven days were to be
spent in the dedication of it, and every day sacrifices were to be
offered upon it, and particularly a goat for a sin-offering ([Eze
43:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#025).md), besides a young bullock for a
sin-offering on the first day ([Eze
43:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#019).md), which teaches us in all our
religious services to have an eye to Christ the great sin-offering.
Neither our persons nor our performances can be acceptable to God unless
sin be taken away, and that cannot be taken away but by the blood of
Christ, which both sanctifies the altar (for Christ entered by his own
blood, [Heb 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012).md) and the gift upon
the altar. There were also to be a bullock and a ram offered for a
burnt-offering ([Eze 43:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#024).md), which was
intended purely for the glory of God, to teach us to have an eye to that
in all our services; we present ourselves as living sacrifices, and our
devotions as spiritual sacrifices, that we and they may be to him for a
name, and for a praise, and for a glory. The dedication of the altar is
here called the cleansing and purging of it, [Eze
43:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#020.md), [Eze
43:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#026.md). Christ, our altar, though he
had no pollution to be cleansed from, yet sanctified himself ([Joh
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#019).md); and when we consecrate the
altars of our hearts to God, to have the fire of holy love always
burning upon them, we must see that they be purified and cleansed from
the love of the world and the lusts of the flesh. It is observable that
there are several differences between the rites of dedication here and
those which were appointed Ex. 29, to intimate that the ceremonial
institutions were mutable things, and the changes in them were earnests
of their period in Christ. Only here, according to the general law, that
all the sacrifices must be seasoned with salt ([Lev
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#013).md), particular orders are given
([Eze 43:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#024).md) that the priests shall
cast salt upon the sacrifices. Grace is the salt with which all our
religious performances must be seasoned, [Col
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#006.md). An everlasting covenant is called
a covenant of salt, because it is incorruptible. The glory reserved for
us is incorruptible and undefiled; and the grace wrought in us is the
hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible. 2. Concerning
the constant use that should be made of it, when it was dedicated:
Henceforward the priests shall make their burnt-offerings and
peace-offerings upon this altar ([Eze
43:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#027).md), for therefore it was
sanctified, that it might sanctify the gift that was offered upon it.
Observe further, (1.) Who were to serve at the altar: The priests of the
seed of Zadok, [Eze 43:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#019.md). That family
was substituted in the room of Abiathar by Solomon, and God confirms it.
His name signifies righteous, for they are the righteous seed that are
priests to God, through Christ the Lord our righteousness. (2.) How they
should prepare for this service ([Eze
43:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#026).md): They shall consecrate
themselves, shall fill their hand with the offerings, in token of the
giving up of themselves with their offerings to God and to his service.
Note, Before we minister to the Lord in holy things we must consecrate
ourselves by getting our hands and hearts filled with those things. (3.)
How they should speed in it ([Eze
43:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#027).md): I will accept you. And if God
now accept our works, if our services be pleasing to him, it is enough,
we need no more. Those that give themselves to God shall be accepted of
God, their persons first and then their performances, through the
Mediator.
