### [Isaiah Chapter 45](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 45:0</span></span>

Cyrus was nominated, in the foregoing chapter, to be God's shepherd;
more is said to him and more of him in this chapter, not only because he
was to be instrumental in the release of the Jews out of their
captivity, but because he was to be therein a type of the great
Redeemer, and that release was to be typical of the great redemption
from sin and death; for that was the salvation of which all the prophets
witnessed. We have here, I. The great things which God would do for
Cyrus, that he might be put into a capacity to release God's people
([Isa 45:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001).md). II. The proof God would
hereby give of his eternal power and godhead, and his universal,
incontestable, sovereignty ([Isa
45:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#005).md). III. A prayer for the
hastening of this deliverance ([Isa
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008).md). IV. A check to the unbelieving
Jews, who quarrelled with God for the lengthening out of their captivity
([Isa 45:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009.md), [Isa
45:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#010).md). V. Encouragement given to the
believing Jews, who trusted in God and continued instant in prayer,
assuring them that God would in due time accomplish this work by the
hand of Cyrus ([Isa 45:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#011).md). VI. A
challenge given to the worshippers of idols and their doom read, and
satisfaction given to the worshippers of the true God and their comfort
secured, with an eye to the Mediator, who is made of God to us both
righteousness and sanctification ([Isa
45:16-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#016).md). And here, as in many other
parts of this prophecy, there is much of Christ and of gospel grace.

[Isaiah 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 45:1</span></span>

Cyrus was a Mede, descended (as some say) from Astyages king of Media.
The pagan writers are not agreed in their accounts of his origin. Some
tell us that in his infancy he was an outcast, left exposed, and was
saved from perishing by a herdsman's wife. However, it is agreed that,
being a man of an active genius, he soon made himself very considerable,
especially when Croesus king of Lydia made a descent upon his country,
which he not only repulsed, but revenged, prosecuting the advantages he
had gained against Croesus with such vigour that in a little time he
took Sardis and made himself master of the rich kingdom of Lydia and the
many provinces that then belonged to it. This made him very great (for
Croesus was rich to a proverb) and enabled him to pursue his victories
in many countries; but it was nearly ten years afterwards that, in
conjunction with his uncle Darius and with the forces of Persia, he made
this famous attack upon Babylon, which is here foretold, and which we
have the history of Dan. 5. Babylon had now grown exorbitantly rich and
strong. It was forty-five miles in compass (some say more): the walls
were thirty-two feet thick and 100 cubits high. Some say, They were so
thick that six chariots might drive abreast upon them; others say, They
were fifty cubits thick and 200 high. Cyrus seems to have had a great
ambition to make himself master of this place, and to have projected it
long; and at last he performed it. Now here, 210 years before it came to
pass, we are told,

I. What great things God would do for him, that he might put it into his
power to release his people. In order to this he shall be a mighty
conqueror and a wealthy monarch and nations shall become tributaries to
him and help him both with men and money. Now that which God here
promised to do for Cyrus he could have done for Zerubbabel, or some of
the Jews themselves; but the wealth and power of this world God has
seldom seen fit to entrust his own people with much of, so many are the
snares and temptations that attend them; but if here has been occasion,
for the god of the church, to make use of them, God has been pleased
rather to put them into the hands of others, to be employed for them,
than to venture them in their own hands. Cyrus is here called God's
anointed, because he was both designed and qualified for this great
service by the counsel of God, and was to be herein a type of the
Messiah. God engages to hold his right hand, not only to strengthen and
sustain him, but to direct his motions and intentions, as Elisha put his
hands upon the king's hands when he was to shoot his arrow against
Syria, [Kg2 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#016.md). Being under such
direction,

1\. He shall extend his conquests very far and shall make nothing of the
opposition that will be given him. Babylon is too strong a place for a
young hero to begin with; and therefore, that he may be able to deal
with that, great additions shall be made to his strength by other
conquests. (1.) Populous kingdoms shall yield to him. God will subdue
nations before him; when he is in the full career of his successes he
shall make nothing of a nation's being born to him at once: yet it is
not he that subdues them; it is God that subdues them for him; the
battle is his, and therefore his is the victory. (2.) Potent kings shall
fall before him: I will loose the loins of kings, either the girdle of
their loins (divesting them of their power and dignity) or the strength
of their loins, and then it was literally fulfilled in Belshazzar, for,
when he was terrified by the handwriting on the wall, the joints of his
loins were loosed, [Dan 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#006). (3..md)
Great cities shall surrender themselves into his hands, without giving
him or themselves any trouble. God will incline the keepers of the city
to open before him the two-leaved gates, not treacherously nor
timorously, but from a full conviction that it is to no purpose to
contend with him; and therefore the gates shall not be shut to keep him
out as an enemy, but thrown open to admit him as a friend. (4.) The
longest and most dangerous marches shall be made easy and ready to him:
I will go before thee, to clear the way, and to conduct thee in it, and
then the crooked places, shall be made straight; or, as some read it,
the hilly places shall be levelled and made even. Those will find a
ready road that have God going before them. (5.) No opposition shall
stand before him. He that gives him his commission will break in pieces
the gates of brass that are shut against him, and cut asunder the bars
of iron wherewith they are fastened. This was fulfilled in the letter,
if that be true which Herodotus reports, that the city of Babylon had
100 gates all of brass, with posts and hooks of the same metal.

2\. He shall replenish his coffers very much ([Isa
45:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#003).md): I will give thee the treasures
of darkness, treasures of gold and silver, that have been long kept
close under lock and key and had not seen the light of many years, or
had been buried under ground by the inhabitants, in their fright, upon
the taking of the city. The riches of many nations had been brought to
Babylon, and Cyrus seized all together. The hidden riches of secret
places, which belonged either to the crown or to private persons, shall
all be a prey to Cyrus. Thus God, designing him to do a piece of service
to his church, paid him richly for it beforehand; and Cyrus very
honestly owned God's goodness to him, and, in consideration of that,
released the captives. [Ezr 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#002.md), God
has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and thereby has obliged me to
build him a house at Jerusalem.

II\. We are here told what God designed in doing all this for Cyrus.
What Cyrus aimed at in undertaking his wars we may easily guess; but
what God aimed at in giving him such wonderful success in his wars we
are here told.

1\. It was that the God of Israel might be glorified: "That thou mayest
know by all this that I the Lord am the God of Israel; for I have called
thee by thy name long before thou wast born." When Cyrus should have
this prophecy of Isaiah shown to him, and should there find his own name
and his own achievements particularly described so long before, he
should thereby be brought to acknowledge that the God of Israel was the
Lord, Jehovah, the only living and true God, and that he continued to
own his Israel though now in captivity. It is well when thus men's
prosperity brings them to the knowledge of God, for too often it makes
them forget him.

2\. It was that the Israel of God might be released, [Isa
45:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#004.md). Cyrus knew not God as the God of
Israel. Having been trained up in the worship of idols, the true God was
to him an unknown God. But, though he knew not God, God not only knew
him when he came into being, but foreknew him, and bespoke him for his
shepherd. He called him by his name, Cyrus, nay, which was yet great
honour, he surnamed him and called him his anointed. And why did God do
all this for Cyrus? Not for his own sake, be it known to him; whether he
was a man of virtue or no is questioned. Xenophon indeed, when he would
describe the heroic virtues of an excellent prince, made use of Cyrus's
name, and many of the particulars of his story, in his Cyropaedia; but
other historians represent him as haughty, cruel, and bloodthirsty. The
reason why God preferred him was for Jacob his servant's sake. Note,
(1.) In all the revolutions of states and kingdoms, the sudden falls of
the great and strong, and the surprising advancements of the weak and
obscure, God is designing the good of his church. (2.) It is therefore
the wisdom of those to whom God has given wealth and power to use them
for his glory, by showing kindness to his people. Cyrus is preferred
that Israel may be released. He shall have a kingdom, only that God's
people may have their liberty; for their kingdom is not of this world,
it is yet to come. In all this Cyrus was a type of Christ, who was made
victorious over principalities and powers, and entrusted with
unsearchable riches, for the use and benefit of God's servants, his
elect. When he ascended on high he led captivity captive, took those
captives that had taken others captives, and opened the prison to those
that were bound.

[Isaiah 45:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 45:5</span></span>

God here asserts his sole and sovereign dominion, as that which he
designed to prove and manifest to the world in all the great things he
did for Cyrus and by him. Observe,

I. How this doctrine is here laid down concerning the sovereignty of the
great Jehovah, in two things: - 1. That he is God alone, and there is no
God besides him. This is here inculcated as a fundamental truth, which,
if it were firmly believed, would abolish idolatry out of the world.
With what an awful, commanding, air of majesty and authority, bidding
defiance, as it were, to all pretenders, does the great God here
proclaim it to the world: I am the Lord, I the Lord, Jehovah, and there
is none else, there is no God besides me, no other self-existent,
self-sufficient, being, none infinite and eternal. And again ([Isa
45:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#006).md), There is none besides me; all
that are set up in competition with me are counterfeits; they are all
vanity and a lie, for I am the Lord, and there is none else. This is
here said to Cyrus, not only to cure him of the sin of his ancestors,
which was the worshipping of idols, but to prevent his falling into the
sin of some of his predecessors in victory and universal monarchy, which
was the setting up of themselves for gods and being idolized, to which
some attribute much of the origin of idolatry. Let Cyrus, when he
becomes thus rich and great, remember that still he is but a man, and
there is no God but one. 2. That he is Lord of all, and there is nothing
done without him ([Isa 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#007).md): I form
the light, which is grateful and pleasing, and I create darkness, which
is grievous and unpleasing. I make peace (put here for all good) and I
create evil, not the evil of sin (God is not the author of that), but
the evil of punishment. I the Lord order, and direct, and do all these
things. Observe, (1.) The very different events that befal the children
of men. Light and darkness are opposite to each other, and yet, in the
course of providence, they are sometimes intermixed, like the morning
and evening twilights, neither day nor night, [Zac
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#006.md). There is a mixture of joys and
sorrows in the same cup, allays to each other. Sometimes they are
counterchanged, as noonday light and midnight darkness. In the
revolution of every day each takes its turn, and there are short
transitions from the one to the other, witness Job's case. (2.) The
self-same cause of both, and that is he that is the first Cause of all:
I the Lord, the fountain of all being, am the fountain of all power. He
who formed the natural light ([Gen
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#003).md) still forms the providential
light. He who at first made peace among the jarring seeds and principles
of nature makes peace in the affairs of men. He who allowed the natural
darkness, which was a mere privation, creates the providential darkness;
for concerning troubles and afflictions he gives positive orders. Note,
The wise God has the ordering and disposing of all our comforts, and all
our crosses, in this world.

II\. How this doctrine is here proved and published. 1. It is proved by
that which God did for Cyrus: "There is no God besides me, for ([Isa
45:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#005).md) I girded thee, though thou hast
not known me. It was not thy own idol, which thou didst know and
worship, that girded thee for this expedition, that gave thee authority
and ability for it. No, it was I that girded thee, I whom thou didst not
know, nor seek to." By this it appears that the God of Israel is the
only true God, that he manages and makes what use he pleases even of
those that are strangers to him and pay their homage to other gods. 2.
It is published to all the world by the word of God, by his providence,
and by the testimony of the suffering Jews in Babylon, that all may know
from the east and from the west, sunrise and sun-set, that the Lord is
God and there is none else. The wonderful deliverance of the Israel of
God proclaimed to all the world that there is none like unto the God of
Jeshurun, that rides on the heavens for their help.

III\. How this doctrine is here improved and applied.

1\. For the comfort of those that earnestly longed, and yet quietly
waited, for the redemption of Israel ([Isa
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008).md): Drop down, you heavens, from
above. Some take this as the saints' prayer for the deliverance. I
rather take it as God's precept concerning it; for he is said to command
deliverances, [Psa 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#004.md). Now the
precept is directed to heaven and earth, and all the hosts of both, as
royal precepts commonly run - To all officers, civil and military. All
the creatures shall be made in their places to contribute to the
carrying on of this great work, when God will have it done. If men will
not be aiding and assisting, God will produce it without them, as he
does the dews of heaven and the grass of the earth, which tarry not for
man, nor wait for the sons of men, [Mic
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007). Observe, (1..md) The method of this
great deliverance that is to be wrought for Israel. Righteousness must
first be wrought in them; they must be brought to repent of their sins,
to renounce their idolatries, to return to God, and reform their lives,
and then the salvation shall be wrought for them, and not till then. We
must not expect salvation without righteousness, for they spring up
together and together the Lord hath created them; what he has joined
together, let not us therefore put asunder. See [Psa
85:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#009.md). Christ died to save us from
our sins, not in our sins, and is made redemption to us by being made to
us righteousness and sanctification. (2.) The means of this great
deliverance. Rather than it shall fail, when the set time for it shall
come, the heavens shall drop down righteousness, and the earth shall
open to bring forth salvation, and both concur to the reformation, and
so to the restoration, of God's Israel. It is from heaven, from above
the skies, that righteousness drops down, for every grace and good gift
is from above; nay, since the more plentiful effusion of the Spirit it
is now poured down, and, if our hearts be open to receive it, the
product will be the fruits of righteousness and the great salvation.

2\. For reproof to those of the church's enemies that opposed this
salvation, or those of her friends that despaired of it ([Isa
45:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009).md): Woe unto him that strives with
his Maker! God is the Maker of all things, and therefore our Maker,
which is a reason why we should always submit to him and never contend
with him. (1.) Let not the proud oppressors, in the elevation of their
spirits, oppose God's designs concerning the deliverance of his people,
nor think to detain them any longer when the time shall come for their
release. Woe to the insulting Babylonians that set God at defiance, as
Pharaoh did, and will not let his people go! (2.) Let not the poor
oppressed, in the dejection of their spirits, murmur and quarrel with
God for the prolonging of their captivity, as if he dealt unjustly or
unkindly with them, or think to force their way out before God's time
shall come. Note, Those will find themselves in a woeful condition that
strive with their Maker; for none ever hardened his heart against God
and prospered. Sinful man is indeed a quarrelsome creature; but let the
potsherds strive with the potsherds of the earth. Men are but earthen
pots, nay, they are broken potsherds, and are made so very much by their
mutual contentions. They are dashed in pieces one against another; and,
if they are disposed to strive, let them strive with one another, let
them meddle with their match; but let them not dare to contend with him
that is infinitely above them, which is as senseless and absurd as,
\[1.\] For the clay to find fault with the potter: Shall the clay say to
him that forms it, "What makest thou? Why dost thou make me of this
shape and not that?" Nay, it is as if the clay should be in such a heat
and passion with the potter as to tell him that he has no hands, or that
he works as awkwardly as if he had none. "Shall the clay pretend to be
wiser than the potter and therefore to advise him, or mightier than the
potter and therefore to control him?" He that gave us being, that gave
us this being, may design concerning us, and dispose of us, as he
pleases; and it is impudent presumption for us to prescribe to him.
Shall we impeach God's wisdom, or question his power, who are ourselves
so curiously, so wonderfully, made? Shall we say, He has no hands, whose
hands made us and in whose hands we are? The doctrine of God's
sovereignty has enough in it to silence all our discontents and
objections against the methods of his providence and grace, [Rom
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#020.md), [Rom
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#021.md). \[2.\] It is as unnatural as for
the child to find fault with the parents, to say to the father, What
begettest thou? or to the mother, "What hast thou brought forth? Why was
I not begotten and born an angel, exempt from the infirmities of human
nature and the calamities of human life?" Must not those who are
children of men expect to share in the common lot and to fare as others
fare? If God is our Father, where is the honour we owe to him by
submitting to his will?

[Isaiah 45:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 45:11</span></span>

The people of God in captivity, who reconciled themselves to the will of
God in their affliction and were content to wait his time for their
deliverance, are here assured that they should not wait in vain.

I. They are invited to enquire concerning the issue of their troubles,
[Isa 45:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#011.md). The Holy One of Israel,
and his Maker, though he does not allow them to strive with him, yet
encourages them, 1. To consult his word: "Ask of me things to come; have
recourse to the prophets and their prophecies, and see what they say
concerning these things. Ask the watchmen, What of the night? Ask them,
How long?" Things to come, as far as they are revealed, belong to us and
to our children, and we must not be strangers to them. 2. To seek unto
him by prayer: "Concerning my sons and concerning the work of my hands,
which as becomes them submit to the will of their Father, the will of
their potter, command you me, not by way of prescription, but by way of
petition. Be earnest in your requests, and confident in your
expectations, as far as both are guided by and grounded upon the
promise." We may not strive with our Maker by passionate complaints, but
we may wrestle with him by faithful and fervent prayer. My sons, and the
work of my hands, commend to me (so some read it), bring them to me and
leave them with me. See the power of prayer, and its prevalency with
God: Thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am; what would you that I
should do unto you? Some read it with an interrogation, as carrying on
the reproof ([Isa 45:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009.md), [Isa
45:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#010).md): Do you question me concerning
things to come? and am I bound to give you an account? And concerning my
children, even concerning the work of my hands, will you command me, or
prescribe to me? Dare you do so? Shall any teach God knowledge, or give
law to him? Those that complain of God do in effect assume an authority
over him.

II\. They are encouraged to depend upon the power of God when they are
brought very low and are utterly incapable of helping themselves, [Isa
45:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#012.md). Their help stands in the name
of the Lord, who made heaven and earth, which he mentions here, not only
for his own glory, but for their comfort. The heavens and earth shall
contribute, if he please, to the deliverance of the church ([Isa
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008).md), for he created both, and
therefore has both at command. 1. He made the earth, and created man
upon it, for it was intended to be a habitation for man, [Psa
115:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#016.md). He has therefore not only
authority, but wisdom and power sufficient to govern man here on this
earth and to make what use he pleases of him. 2. His hands have
stretched out the heavens, and all their hosts he commanded into being
at first, and therefore still governs all their motions and influences.
It is good news to God's Israel that their God is the creator and
governor of the world.

III\. They are particularly told what God would do for them, that they
might know what to depend upon; and this shall lead them to expect a
more glorious Redeemer and redemption, of whom, and of which, Cyrus and
their deliverance by him were types and figures.

1\. Liberty shall be proclaimed to them, [Isa
45:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013.md). Cyrus is the man that shall
proclaim it; and, in order hereunto, God will put power into his hands:
I have raised him up in righteousness, that is, in pursuance and
performance of my promises and to plead my people's just but injured
cause. He will give him success in all his enterprises, particularly
that against Babylon: I will direct all his ways; and then it follows
that he will prosper him, for those must needs speed well that are under
a divine direction. God will make plain the way of those whom he designs
to employ for him. Two things Cyrus must do for God: - (1.) Jerusalem is
God's city, but it is now in ruins, and he must rebuild it, that is, he
must give orders for the rebuilding of it, and give wherewithal to do
it. (2.) Israel is God's people, but they are now captives, and he must
release them freely and generously, not demanding any ransom, nor
compounding with them for price or reward. And Christ is anointed to do
that for poor captive souls which Cyrus was to do for the captive Jews,
to proclaim the opening of the prison to those that were bound ([Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001).md), enlargement from a worse
bondage than that in Babylon.

2\. Provision shall be made for them. They went out poor, and unable to
bear the expenses of their return and re-establishment; and therefore it
is promised that the labour of Egypt and other nations should come over
to them and be theirs, [Isa 45:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#014.md).
Cyrus, having conquered those countries, out of their spoils provided
for the returning Jews; and he ordered his subjects to furnish them with
necessaries ([Ezr 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#004).md), so that they
did not go out empty from Babylon any more than from Egypt. Those that
are redeemed by Christ shall be not only provided for, but enriched.
Those whose spirits God stirs up to go to the heavenly Zion may depend
upon him to bear their charges. The world is theirs as far as is good
for them.

3\. Proselytes shall be brought over to them: Men of stature shall come
after thee in chains; they shall fall down to thee, saying, Surely God
is in thee. This was in part fulfilled when many of the people of the
land became Jews ([Est 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#017).md), and
said, We will go with you, humbly begging leave to do so, for we have
heard that God is with you, [Zac 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#023.md).
The restoration would be a means of the conviction of many and the
conversion of some. Perhaps many of the Chaldeans who were now
themselves conquered by Cyrus, when they saw the Jews going back in
triumph, came and begged pardon for the affronts and abuses they had
given them, owned that God was among them and that he was God alone, and
therefore desired to join themselves to them. But this promise was to
have its full accomplishment in the gospel church, - when the Gentiles
shall become obedient by word and deed to the faith of Christ ([Rom
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#018).md), as willing captives to the
church ([Psa 110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003).md), glad to wear her
chains, - when an infidel, beholding the public worship of Christians,
shall own himself convinced that God is with them of a truth ([Co1
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#024.md), [Co1
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#025).md) and shall assay to join himself
to them, - and when those that had been of the synagogue of Satan shall
come and worship before the church's feet, and be made to know that God
has loved her ([Rev 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#009).md), and the
kings of the earth and the nations shall bring their glory into the
gospel Jerusalem, [Rev 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#024.md). Note, It
is good to be with those, though it be in chains, that have God with
them.

IV\. They are taught to trust God further than they can see him. The
prophet puts this word into their mouths, and goes before them in saying
it ([Isa 45:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#015).md): Verily, thou art a
God that hidest thyself. 1. God hid himself when he brought them into
the trouble, hid himself and was wroth, [Isa
57:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#017.md). Note, Though God be his
people's God and Saviour, yet sometimes, when they provoke him, he hides
himself from them in displeasure, suspends his favours, and lays them
under his frowns: but let them wait upon the Lord that hides his face,
[Isa 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#017.md). 2. He hid himself when he
was bringing them out of the trouble. Note, When God is acting as
Israel's God and Saviour commonly his way is in the sea, [Psa
77:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#019.md). The salvation of the church is
carried on in a mysterious way, by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts
working on men's spirits ([Zac 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006).md),
by weak and unlikely instruments, small and accidental occurrences, and
not wrought till the last extremity; but this is our comfort, though God
hide himself, we are sure he is the God of Israel, the Saviour. See [Job
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#014.md).

V. They are instructed to triumph over idolaters and all the worshippers
of other gods ([Isa 45:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#016).md): Those who
are makers of idols, not only who frame them, but who make gods of them
by praying to them, shall be ashamed and confounded, when they shall be
convinced of their mistakes and shall be forced to acknowledged that the
God of Israel is the only true God, and when they shall be disappointed
in their expectations from their idols, under whose protection they had
put themselves. They shall go to confusion when they shall find that
they can neither excuse the sin nor escape the punishment of it, [Psa
97:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#007.md). It is not here and there one
more timorous than the rest that shall thus shrink, and give up the
cause, but all of them; nay, though they appear in a body, though hand
join in hand, and they do all they can to keep one another in
countenance, yet they shall go to confusion together. Bind them in
bundles, to burn them.

VI\. They are assured that those who trust in God shall never be made
ashamed of their confidence in him, [Isa
45:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#017.md). Now that God was about to
deliver them out of Babylon he directed them by his prophet, 1. To look
up to him as the author of their salvation: Israel shall be saved in the
Lord. Not only their salvation shall be wrought out by his power, but it
shall be treasured up for them in his grace and promise, and so secured
to them. They shall be saved in him; for his name shall be their strong
tower, into which they shall run, and in which they shall be safe. 2. To
look beyond this temporal deliverance to that which is spiritual and has
reference to another world, to think of that salvation by the Messiah
which is an everlasting salvation, the salvation of the soul, a rescue
from everlasting misery and a restoration to everlasting bliss. "Give
diligence to make that sure, for it may be made sure, so sure that you
shall not be ashamed nor confounded world with out end. You shall not
only be delivered from the everlasting shame and contempt which will be
the portion of idolaters ([Dan 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002).md),
but you shall have everlasting honour and glory." \[1.\] There is a
world without end; and it will be well or ill with us according as it
will be with us in that world. \[2.\] Those who are saved with the
everlasting salvation shall never be ashamed of what they did or
suffered in the hopes of it; for it will so far outdo their expectations
as to be a more abundant reimbursement. The returning captives owned
that to them did belong confusion of face ([Dan
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#007.md), [Dan
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#008).md); yet God tells them that they
shall not be confounded, but shall have assurance for ever. Those who
are confounded as penitents for their own sin shall not be confounded as
believers in God's promise and power.

VII\. They are engaged for ever to cleave to God, and never to desert
him, never to distrust him. What had been often inculcated before is
here again repeated, for the encouragement of his people to continue
faithful to him, and to hope that he would be so to them: I am the Lord,
and there is none else. That the Lord we serve and trust in is God alone
appears by the two great lights, that of nature and that of revelation.

1\. It appears by the light of nature; for he made the world, and
therefore may justly demand its homage ([Isa
45:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#018).md): "Thus saith the Lord, that
created the heavens and formed the earth, I am the Lord, the sovereign
Lord of all, and there is none else." The gods of the heathen did not do
this, nay, they did not pretend to do it. He here mentions the creation
of the heavens, but enlarges more upon that of the earth, because that
is the part of the creation which we have the nearest view of and are
most conversant with. It is here observed, (1.) That he formed it. It is
not a rude and indigested chaos, but cast into the most proper shape and
size by Infinite Wisdom. (2.) That he fixed it. When he had made it he
established it, founded it on the seas, ([Psa
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#002).md), hung it on nothing ([Job
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#007).md) as at first he made it of
nothing, and yet made it substantial an hung it fast, ponderibus librata
suis - poised by its own weight. (3.) That he fitted it for use, and for
the service of man, to whom he designed to give it. He created it not in
vain, merely to be a proof of his power; but he formed it to be
inhabited by the children of men, and for that end he drew the waters
off from it, with which it was at first covered, and made the dry land
appear, [Psa 104:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#006.md), [Psa
104:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#007.md). Be it observed here, to the
honour of God's wisdom, that he made nothing in vain, but intended every
thing for some end and fitted it to answer the intention. If any man
prove to have been made in vain, it is his own fault. It should also be
observed, to the honour of God's goodness and his favour to man, that he
reckoned that not made in vain which serves for his use and benefit, to
be a habitation and maintenance for him.

2\. It appears by the light of revelation. As the works of God
abundantly prove that he is God alone, so does his word, and the
discovery he has made of himself and of his mind and will by it. His
oracles far exceed those of the Pagan deities, as well as his
operations, [Isa 45:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#019.md). The preference
is here placed in three things: - All that God has said is plain,
satisfactory, and just. (1.) In the manner of the delivery of it it is
plain and open: I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the
earth. The Pagan deities delivered their oracles out of dens and
caverns, with a low and hollow voice, and in ambiguous expressions;
those that had familiar spirits whispered and muttered ([Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019).md); but God delivered his law from
the top of Mount Sinai before all the thousands of Israel, in distinct,
audible, and intelligible sounds. Wisdom cries in the chief places of
concourse, [Pro 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020.md), [Pro
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#021.md); [Pro
8:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#001.md). The vision is written, and made
plain, so that he who runs may read it; if he be obscure to any, they
may thank themselves. Christ pleaded in his own defence what God says
here, In secret have I said nothing, [Joh
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#020). (2..md) In the use and benefit of
it it was highly satisfactory: I said not unto the seed of Jacob, who
consulted these oracles and governed themselves by them, Seek you me in
vain, as the false gods did to their worshippers, who sought for the
living to the dead, [Isa 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019.md). This
includes all the gracious answers that God gave both to those who
consulted him (his word is to them a faithful guide) and to those that
prayed to him. The seed of Jacob are a praying people; it is the
generation of those that seek him, [Psa
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#006.md). And, as he has in his word
invited them to seek him, so he never denied their believing prayers nor
disappointed their believing expectations. He said not to them, to any
of them, Seek you me in vain; for, if he did not think fit to give them
the particular thing they prayed for, yet he gave them such a
sufficiency of grace and such comfort and satisfaction of soul as were
equivalent. What we say of winter is true of prayer, It never rots in
the skies. God not only gives a gracious answer to those that diligently
seek him, but will be their bountiful rewarder. (3.) In the matter of it
it was incontestably just, and there was no iniquity in it: I the Lord
speak righteousness, I declare things that are right, and consonant to
the eternal rules and reasons of good and evil. The heathen deities
dictated those things to their worshippers which were the reproach of
human nature and tended to the extirpation of virtue; but God speaks
righteousness, dictates that which is right in itself and tends to make
men righteous; and therefore he is God, and there is none else.

[Isaiah 45:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 45:20</span></span>

What here is said is intended, as before,

I. For the conviction of idolators, to show them their folly in
worshipping gods that cannot help them, and neglecting a God that can.
Let all that have escaped of the nations, not only the people of the
Jews, but those of other nations that were by Cyrus released out of
captivity in Babylon, let them come, and hear what is to be said against
the worshipping of idols, that they may be cured of it as well as the
Jews, that Babylon, which had of old been the womb of idolatry, might
now become the grave of it. Let the refugees assemble themselves and
come together; God has something to say to them for their own good, and
it is this, that idolatry is a foolish sottish thing, upon two accounts:
-

1\. It is setting up a refuge of lies for themselves: They set up the
wood of their graven image; for that is the substratum. Though they
overlay it with gold, deck it with ornaments, and make a god of it, yet
still it is but wood. They pray to a god that cannot save; for he cannot
hear, he cannot help, he can do nothing. How do those disparage
themselves who give honour to that as a god which cannot, as a god, give
good to them! How do those deceive themselves who pray for relief to
that which is in no capacity at all to relieve them! Certainly those
have no knowledge, or are brutish in their knowledge, who take so much
pains, and do so much penance, in seeking the favour of a god that has
no power.

2\. It is setting up a rival with God, the only living and true God
([Isa 45:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#021).md): "Summon them all; tell
them that the great cause shall again be tried, though once adjudged,
between God and Baal. Bring them near, and let them take counsel
together what to say in defence of themselves and their idols. It shall,
as before, be put upon this issue: let them show when any of their gods
did with any certainty foretel future events, as the God of Israel has
done, and it shall be acknowledged that they have some colour for their
pretensions. But None of them ever did; their prophets were lying
prophets; but I the Lord have told it from that time, long before it
came to pass; therefore you must own thee is no other God besides me."
(1.) None besides is fit to rule. He is a just God, and rules in
justice, and will execute justice for those that are oppressed. (2.)
None besides is able to help. As he is a just God, so he is the Saviour,
who can save without the assistance of any, but without whom none can
save. Those therefore have no sense of truth and falsehood, good and
evil, no, nor of their own interest, that set up any in competition with
him.

II\. For the comfort and encouragement of all God's faithful
worshippers, whoever they are, [Isa
45:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#022.md). Those that worship idols pray
to gods that cannot save; but the God of Israel says it to all the ends
of the earth, to his people, though they are scattered into the utmost
corners of the world and seem to be lost and forgotten in their
dispersion, "Let them but look to me by faith and prayer, look above
instruments and second causes, look off from all pretenders, and look up
to me, and they shall be saved." It seems to refer further to the
conversion of the Gentiles that live in the ends of the earth, the most
distant nations, when the standard of the gospel is set up. To it shall
the Gentiles seek. When Christ is lifted up from the earth, as the
brazen serpent upon the pole, he shall draw the eyes of all men to him.
They shall all be invited to look unto him, as the stung Israelites did
to the brazen serpent; and so strong is the eye of faith that by divine
grace it will reach the Saviour and fetch in salvation by him even from
the ends of the earth; for he is God, and the is none else. Two things
are here promised, for the abundant satisfaction of all that by faith
look to the Saviour: -

1\. That the glory of the God they serve shall be greatly advanced; and
this will be good news to all the Lord's people, that, how much soever
they and their names are depressed, God will be exalted, [Isa
45:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023.md). This is confirmed by an oath,
that we might have strong consolation: I have sworn by myself (and God
can swear by no greater, [Heb 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013).md);
the word has gone out of my mouth, and shall neither be recalled nor
return empty; it has gone forth in righteousness, for it is the most
reasonable equitable thing in the world that he who made all should be
Lord of all, that, since all beings are derived from him, they should
all be devoted to him. He has said it, and it shall be made good, I will
be exalted, [Psa 46:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#010.md). He has assured
us, (1.) That he will be universally submitted to, that the kingdoms of
the world shall become his kingdom. They shall do him homage - Unto me
every knee shall bow; and they shall bind themselves by an oath of
allegiance to him - Unto me every tongue shall swear. This is applied to
the dominion of our Lord Jesus, [Rom
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#010.md), [Rom
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#011.md). We shall all stand before the
judgment-seat of Christ and give account to him, for it is written, As I
live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall
confess to God; and it seems to be referred to, [Psa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009.md), [Psa
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#010.md). If the heart be brought into
obedience to Christ, and made willing in the day of his power, the knee
will bow to him in humble adorations and addresses, and in cheerful
obedience to his commands, submission to his disposals, and compliance
with his will in both; and the tongue will swear to him, will lay a bond
upon the soul to engage it for ever to him; for he that bears an honest
mind never startles at assurances. (2.) That he will be universally
sought unto, and application shall be made to him from all parts of the
world: Unto him shall men of distant countries come, to implore his
favour. Unto thee shall all flesh come with their request, [Psa
65:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#002.md). And, when Christ was lifted up
from the earth, he drew all men to him. (3.) That it will be to no
purpose to make opposition to him. All that are incensed against him,
that rage at his bonds and cords - the nations that are angry because he
has taken to himself his great power and has reigned, that have been
incensed at the strictness of his laws, the success of his gospel, and
the spiritual nature of his kingdom - they shall be ashamed; some shall
be brought to a penitential shame for it, others to a remediless ruin.
One way or other, sooner or later, all that are uneasy at Christ's
government and victories will be made ashamed of their folly and
obstinacy. Blessed be God for the assurance here given us that, whatever
becomes of us and our interests, the Lord will reign for ever!

2\. That the welfare of the souls they are concerned for shall be
effectually secured: Surely shall one say, and another shall learn by
his example to say the same, so that all the seed of Israel, according
to the Spirit, shall say, and stand to it, (1.) That God has a
sufficiency for them and that in Christ there is enough to supply all
their needs: In the Lord is all righteousness and strength (so the
margin reads it); he is himself righteous and strong. He can do every
thing, and yet will do nothing but what is unquestionably just and
equitable. He has also wherewithal to supply the needs of those that
seek to him and depend upon him, upon the equity of his providence and
the treasures of his grace; nay, we may say, not only "He has it," but,
"In him we have it," because he has said that he will be to us a God. In
the Lord the captive Jews had righteousness (that is, grace both to
sanctify their afflictions to them and to qualify them for deliverance)
and strength for their support and escape. In the Lord Jesus we have
righteousness to recommend us to the good-will of God towards us, and
strength to begin and carry on the good work of God in us. He is the
fountain of both, and on him we must depend for both, must go forth in
his strength, and make mention of his righteousness, [Psa
71:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#016). (2..md) That they shall have an
abundant bliss and satisfaction in this. \[1.\] The people of the Jews
shall in the Lord be justified before men and openly glory in their God.
The oppressors reproached them, loaded them with calumny, and boasted
even of a right to oppress them, as abandoned by their God; but, when
God shall work out their deliverance, that shall be their justification
from these hard censures, and therefore they shall glory in it. \[2.\]
All true Christians, that depend upon Christ for strength and
righteousness, in him shall be justified and shall glory in that.
Observe, First, All believers are the seed of Israel, an upright praying
seed. Secondly, The great privilege they enjoy by Jesus Christ is that
in him, and for his sake, they are justified before God, Christ being
made of God to them righteousness. All that are justified will own it is
in Christ that they are justified, nor could they be justified by any
other; and those who are justified shall be glorified. And therefore,
Thirdly, The great duty believers owe to Christ is to glory in him, and
to make their boast of him. Therefore he is made all in all to us, that
whose glories may glory in the Lord; and let us comply with this
intention.
