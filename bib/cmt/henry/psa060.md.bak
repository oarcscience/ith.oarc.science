### [Psalms Chapter 60](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 60:0</span></span>

After many psalms which David penned in a day of distress this comes
which was calculated for a day of triumph; it was penned after he was
settled in the throne, upon occasion of an illustrious victory which God
blessed his forces with over the Syrians and Edomites; it was when David
was in the zenith of his prosperity, and the affairs of his kingdom seem
to have been in a better posture then ever they were either before or
after. See [Sa2 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#003.md), [Sa2
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#013.md); [Ch1
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#003.md), [Ch1
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#012.md). David, in prosperity, was as
devout as David in adversity. In this psalm, I. He reflects upon the bad
state of the public interests, for many years, in which God had been
contending with them ([Psa 60:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001).md).
II. He takes notice of the happy turn lately given to their affairs
([Psa 60:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#004).md). III. He prays for the
deliverance of God's Israel from their enemies ([Psa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#005).md). IV. He triumphs in hope of
their victories over their enemies, and begs of God to carry them on and
complete them ([Psa 60:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#006).md). In
singing this psalm we may have an eye both to the acts of the church and
to the state of our own souls, both which have their struggles.

To the chief musician upon Shushan-eduth, Michtam of David, to teach,
when he strove with Aram-naharaim, and with Aramzobah, when Joab
returned, and smote of Edom in the valley of salt 12,000.

[Psalms 60:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 60:1</span></span>

The title gives us an account, 1. Of the general design of the psalm. It
is Michtam - David's jewel, and it is to teach. The Levites must teach
it to the people, and by it teach them both to trust in God and to
triumph in him; we must, in it, teach ourselves and one another. In a
day of public rejoicing we have need to be taught to direct our joy to
God and to terminate it in him, to give none of that praise to the
instruments of our deliverance which is due to him only, and to
encourage our hopes with our joys. 2. Of the particular occasion of it.
It was at a time, (1.) When he was at war with the Syrians, and still
had a conflict with them, both those of Mesopotamia and those of Zobah.
(2.) When he had gained a great victory over the Edomites, by his
forces, under the command of Joab, who had left 12,000 of the enemy dead
upon the spot. David has an eye to both these concerns in this psalm: he
is in care about his strife with the Assyrians, and in reference to that
he prays; he is rejoicing in his success against the Edomites, and in
reference to that he triumphs with a holy confidence in God that he
would complete the victory. We have our cares at the same time that we
have our joys, and they may serve for a balance to each other, that
neither may exceed. They may likewise furnish us with matter both for
prayer and praise, for both must be laid before God with suitable
affections and emotions. If one point be gained, yet in another we are
still striving: the Edomites are vanquished, but the Syrians are not;
therefore let not him that girds on the harness boast as if he had put
it off.

In these verses, which begin the psalm, we have,

I. A melancholy memorial of the many disgraces and disappointments which
God had, for some years past, put the people under. During the reign of
Saul, especially in the latter end of it, and during David's struggle
with the house of Saul, while he reigned over Judah only, the affairs of
the kingdom were much perplexed, and the neighbouring nations were
vexatious to them. 1. He complains of hard things which they had seen
(that is, which they had suffered), while the Philistines and other
ill-disposed neighbours took all advantages against them, [Psa
60:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#003.md). God sometimes shows even his own
people hard things in this world, that they may not take up their rest
in it, but may dwell at ease in him only. 2. He owns God's displeasure
to be the cause of all the hardships they had undergone: "Thou hast been
displeased by us, displeased against us ([Psa
60:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001).md), and in thy displeasure hast
cast us off and scattered us, hast put us out of thy protection, else
our enemies could not have prevailed thus against us. They would never
have picked us up and made a prey of us if thou hadst not broken the
staff of bands ([Zac 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#014).md) by which
we were united, and so scattered us." Whatever our trouble is, and
whoever are the instruments of it, we must own the hand of God, his
righteous hand, in it. 3. He laments the ill effects and consequences of
the miscarriages of the late years. The whole nation was in a
convulsion: Thou hast made the earth (or the land) to tremble, [Psa
60:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#002.md). The generality of the people had
dreadful apprehensions of the issue of these things. The good people
themselves were in a consternation: "Thou hast made us to drink the wine
of astonishment ([Psa 60:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#003).md); we were
like men intoxicated, and at our wits' end, not knowing how to reconcile
these dispensations with God's promises and his relation to his people;
we are amazed, can do nothing, nor know we what to do." Now this is
mentioned here to teach, that is, for the instruction of the people.
When God is turning his hand in our favour, it is good to remember our
former calamities, (1.) That we may retain the good impressions they
made upon us, and may have them revived. Our souls must still have the
affliction and the misery in remembrance, that they may be humbled
within us, [Lam 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#019.md), [Lam
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#020). (2..md) That God's goodness to us,
in relieving us and raising us up, may be more magnified; for it is as
life from the dead, so strange, so refreshing. Our calamities serve as
foils to our joys. (3.) That we may not be secure, but may always
rejoice with trembling, as those that know not how soon we may be
returned into the furnace again, which we were lately taken out of as
the silver is when it is not thoroughly refined.

II\. A thankful notice of the encouragement God had given them to hope
that, though things had been long bad, they would now begin to mend
([Psa 60:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#004).md): "Thou hast given a banner
to those that fear thee (for, as bad as the times are, there is a
remnant among us that desire to fear thy name, for whom thou hast a
tender concern), that it may be displayed by thee, because of the truth
of thy promise which thou wilt perform, and to be displayed by them, in
defense of truth and equity," [Psa
45:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#004.md). This banner was David's
government, the establishment and enlargement of it over all Israel. The
pious Israelites, who feared God and had a regard to the divine
designation of David to the throne, took his elevation as a token for
good, and like the lifting up of a banner to them, 1. It united them, as
soldiers are gathered together to their colours. Those that were
scattered ([Psa 60:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001).md), divided among
themselves, and so weakened and exposed, coalesced in him when he was
fixed upon the throne. 2. It animated them, and put life and courage
into them, as the soldiers are animated by the sight of their banner. 3.
It struck a terror upon their enemies, to whom they could now hang out a
flag of defiance. Christ, the Son of David, is given for an ensign of
the people ([Isa 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010).md), for a banner
to those that fear God; in him, as the centre of their unity, they are
gathered together in one; to him they seek, in him they glory and take
courage. His love is the banner over them; in his name and strength they
wage war with the powers of darkness, and under him the church becomes
terrible as an army with banners.

III\. A humble petition for seasonable mercy. 1. That God would be
reconciled to them, though he had been displeased with them. In his
displeasure their calamities began, and therefore in his favour their
prosperity must begin: O turn thyself to us again! ([Psa
60:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001).md) smile upon us, and take part
with us; be at peace with us, and in that peace we shall have peace.
Tranquillus Deus tranquillat omnia - A God at peace with us spreads
peace over all the scene. 2. That they might be reconciled to one
another, though they had been broken and wretchedly divided among
themselves: "Heal the breaches of our land ([Psa
60:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#002).md), not only the breaches made upon
us by our enemies, but the breaches made among ourselves by our unhappy
divisions." Those are breaches which the folly and corruption of man
makes, and which nothing but the wisdom and grace of God can make up and
repair, by pouring out a spirit of love and peace, by which only a
shaken shattered kingdom is set to rights and saved from ruin. 3. That
thus they might be preserved out of the hands of their enemies ([Psa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#005).md): "That thy beloved may be
delivered, and not made a prey of, save with thy right hand, with thy
own power and by such instruments as thou art pleased to make the men of
thy right hand, and hear me." Those that fear God are his beloved; they
are dear to him as the apple of his eye. They are often in distress, but
they shall be delivered. God's own right hand shall save them; for those
that have his heart have his hand. Save them, and hear me. Note, God's
praying people may take the general deliverances of the church as
answers to their payers in particular. If we improve what interest we
have at the throne of grace for blessings for the public, and those
blessings be bestowed, besides the share we have with others in the
benefit of them we may each of us say, with peculiar satisfaction, "God
has therein heard me, and answered me."

[Psalms 60:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 60:6</span></span>

David is here rejoicing in hope and praying in hope; such are the
triumphs of the saints, not so much upon the account of what they have
in possession as of what they have in prospect ([Psa
60:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#006).md): "God has spoken in his holiness
(that is, he has given me his word of promise, has sworn by his
holiness, and he will not lie unto David, [Psa
89:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#035).md), therefore I will rejoice, and
please myself with the hopes of the performance of the promise, which
was intended for more than a pleasing promise," Note, God's word of
promise, being a firm foundation of hope, is a full fountain of joy to
all believers.

I. David here rejoices; and it is in prospect of two things: -

1\. The perfecting of this revolution in his own kingdom. God having
spoken in his holiness that David shall be king, he doubts not but the
kingdom is all his own, as sure as if it were already in his hand: I
will divide Shechem (a pleasant city in Mount Ephraim) and mete out the
valley of Succoth, as my own. Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine, and
both are entirely reduced, [Psa 60:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#007.md).
Ephraim would furnish him with soldiers for his life-guards and his
standing forces; Judah would furnish him with able judges for his courts
of justice; and thus Ephraim would be the strength of his head and Judah
his lawgiver. Thus may an active believer triumph in the promises, and
take the comfort of all the good contained in them; for they are all yea
and amen in Christ. "God has spoken in his holiness, and then pardon is
mine, peace mine, grace mine, Christ mine, heaven mine, God himself
mine." All is yours, for you are Christ's, [Co1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#022.md), [Co1
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#023.md).

2\. The conquering of the neighbouring nations, which had been vexatious
to Israel, were still dangerous, and opposed the throne of David, [Psa
60:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#008.md). Moab shall be enslaved, and put
to the meanest drudgery. The Moabites became David's servants, [Sa2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002.md). Edom shall be made a dunghill to
throw old shoes upon; at least David shall take possession of it as his
own, which was signified by drawing off his shoe over it, [Rut
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#007.md). As for the Philistines, let them,
if they dare, triumph over him as they had done; he will soon force them
to change their note. Rather let those that know their own interest
triumph because of him; for it would be the greatest kindness imaginable
to them to be brought into subjection to David and communion with
Israel. But the war is not yet brought to an end; there is a strong
city, Rabbah (perhaps) of the children of Ammon, which yet holds out;
Edom is not yet subdued. Now, (1.) David is here enquiring for help to
carry on the ark: "Who will bring me into the strong city? What allies,
what auxiliaries, can I depend upon, to make me master of the enemies'
country and their strongholds?" Those that have begun a good work cannot
but desire to make a thorough work of it, and to bring it to perfection.
(2.) He is expecting it from God only: "Wilt not thou, O God? For thou
hast spoken in thy holiness; and wilt not thou be as good as thy word?"
He takes notice of the frowns of Providence they had been under: Thou
hadst, in appearance, cast us off; thou didst not go forth with our
armies. When they were defeated and met with disappointments, they owned
it was because they wanted (that is, because they had forfeited) the
gracious presence of God with them; yet they do not therefore fly off
from him, but rather take so much the faster hold of him; and the less
he has done for them of late the more they hoped he would do. At the
same time that they own God's justice in what was past they hope in his
mercy for what was to come: "Though thou hadst cast us off, yet thou
wilt not contend for ever, thou wilt not always chide; though thou hadst
cast us off, yet thou hast begun to show mercy; and wilt thou not
perfect what thou hast begun?" The Son of David, in his sufferings,
seemed to be cast off by his Father when he cried out, Why hast thou
forsaken me? and yet even then he obtained a glorious victory over the
powers of darkness and their strong city, a victory which will
undoubtedly be completed at last; for he has gone forth conquering and
to conquer. The Israel of God, his spiritual Israel, are likewise,
through him, more than conquerors. Though sometimes they may be tempted
to think that God has cast them off, and may be foiled in particular
conflicts, yet God will bring them into the strong city at last.
Vincimur in praelio, sed non in bello - We are foiled in a battle, but
not in the whole war. A lively faith in the promise will assure us, not
only that the God of peace shall tread Satan under our feet shortly, but
that it is our Father's good pleasure to give us the kingdom.

II\. He prays in hope. His prayer is, Give us help from trouble, [Psa
60:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#011.md). Even in the day of their
triumph they see themselves in trouble, because still in war, which is
troublesome even to the prevailing side. None therefore can delight in
war but those that love to fish in troubled waters. The help from
trouble they pray for is preservation from those they were at war with.
Though now they were conquerors, yet (so uncertain are the issues of
war), unless God gave them help in the next engagement, they might be
defeated; therefore, Lord, send us help from the sanctuary. Help from
trouble is rest from war, which they prayed for, as those that contended
for equity, not for victory. Sic quaerimus pacem - Thus we seek for
peace. The hope with which they support themselves in this prayer has
two things in it: - 1. A diffidence of themselves and all their
creature-confidences: Vain is the help of man. Then only we are
qualified to receive help from God when we are brought to own the
insufficiency of all creatures to do that for us which we expect him to
do. 2. A confidence in God, and in his power and promise ([Psa
60:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#012).md): "Through God we shall do
valiantly, and so we shall do victoriously; for he it is, and he only,
that shall tread down our enemies, and shall have the praise of doing
it." Note, (1.) Our confidence in God must be so far from superseding
that it must encourage and quicken our endeavours in the way of our
duty. Though it is God that performs all things for us, yet there is
something to be done by us. (2.) Hope in God is the best principle of
true courage. Those that do their duty under his conduct may afford to
do it valiantly; for what need those fear who have God on their side?
(3.) It is only through God, and by the influence of his grace, that we
do valiantly; it is he that puts strength into us, and inspires us, who
of ourselves are weak and timorous, with courage and resolution. (4.)
Though we do ever so valiantly, the success must be attributed entirely
to him; for he it is that shall tread down our enemies, and not we
ourselves. All our victories, as well as our valour, are from him, and
therefore at his feet all our crown must be cast.
