### [Joshua Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 6:0</span></span>

Joshua opened the campaign with the siege of Jericho, a city which could
not trust so much to the courage of its people as to act offensively,
and to send out its forces to oppose Israel's landing and encamping, but
trusted so much to the strength of its walls as to stand upon its
defence, and not to surrender, or desire conditions of peace. Now here
we have the story of the taking of it, I. The directions and assurances
which the captain of the Lord's host gave concerning it ([Jos
6:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#001).md). II. The trial of the people's
patient obedience in walking round the city six days ([Jos
6:6-14](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#006).md). III. The wonderful delivery
of it into their hands the seventh day, with a solemn charge to them to
use it as a devoted thing ([Jos
6:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#015.md) and [Jos
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#024).md). IV. The preservation of Rahab
and her relations ([Jos 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#022.md), [Jos
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#023.md), [Jos
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#025).md). V. A curse pronounced upon the
man that should dare to rebuild this city ([Jos
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#026.md), [Jos
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#027).md). An abstract of this story we
find among the trophies of faith, [Heb
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#030.md). "By faith the walls of Jericho
fell down, after they were compassed about seven days."

[Joshua 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 6:1</span></span>

We have here a contest between God and the men of Jericho, and their
different resolutions, upon which it is easy to say whose word shall
prevail.

I. Jericho resolves Israel shall not be its master, [Jos
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#001.md). It was straitly shut up, because
of the children of Israel. It did shut up, and it was shut up (so it is
in the margin); it did shut up itself, being strongly fortified both by
art and nature, and it was shut up by the obstinacy and resolution of
the inhabitants, who agreed never to surrender nor so much as sound a
parley; none went out as deserters or to treat of peace, nor were any
admitted in to offer peace. Thus were they infatuated, and their hearts
hardened to their own destruction - the miserable case and character of
all those that strengthen themselves against the Almighty, [Job
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#025.md).

II\. God resolves Israel shall be its master, and that quickly, The
captain of the Lord's host, here called Jehovah, taking notice how
strongly Jericho was fortified and how strictly guarded, and knowing
Joshua's thoughts and cares about reducing it, and perhaps his fears of
a disgrace there and of stumbling at the threshold, gave him here all
the assurance he could desire of success ([Jos
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#002).md): See, I have given into thy hand
Jericho. Not, "I will do it, but, I have done it; it is all thy own, as
sure as if it were already in thy possession." It was designed that this
city, being the first-fruits of Canaan, should be entirely devoted to
God, and that neither Joshua nor Israel should ever be one mite the
richer for it, and yet it is here said to be given into their hand; for
we must reckon that most our own which we have an opportunity of
honouring God with and employing in his service. Now. 1. The captain of
the Lord's host gives directions how the city should be besieged. No
trenches are to be opened, no batteries erected, nor battering rams
drawn up, nor any military preparations made; but the ark of God must be
carried by the priests round the city once a day for six days together,
and seven times the seventh day, attended by the men of war in silence,
the priests all the while blowing with trumpets of rams' horns, [Jos
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#003.md), [Jos
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#004.md). This was all they were to do. 2.
He assures them that on the seventh day before night they should,
without fail, be masters of the town. Upon a signal given, they must all
shout, and immediately the wall should fall down, which would not only
expose the inhabitants, but so dispirit them that they would not be able
to make any resistance, [Jos 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#005.md). God
appointed this way, (1.) To magnify his own power, that he might be
exalted in his own strength ([Psa
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#013).md), not in the strength of
instruments. God would hereby yet further make bare his own almighty arm
for the encouragement of Israel and the terror and confusion of the
Canaanites. (2.) To put an honour upon his ark, the instituted token of
his presence, and to give a reason for the laws by which the people were
obliged to look upon it with the most profound veneration and respect.
When, long after this, the ark was brought into the camp without orders
from God, it was looked upon as a profanation of it, and the people paid
dearly for their presumption, [Sa1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#003.md), etc. but now that it was done by
the divine appointment it was an honour to the ark of God, and a great
encouragement to the faith of Israel. (3.) It was likewise to put honour
upon the priests, who were appointed upon this occasion to carry the ark
and sound the trumpets. Ordinarily the priests were excused from war,
but that this privilege, with other honours and powers that the law had
given them, might not be grudged them, in this service they are
principally employed, and so the people are made sensible what blessings
they were to the public and how well worthy of all the advantages
conferred upon them. (4.) It was to try the faith, obedience, and
patience, of the people, to try whether they would observe a precept
which to human policy seemed foolish to obey and believe a promise which
in human probability seemed impossible to be performed. They were also
proved whether they could patiently bear the reproaches of their enemies
and patiently wait for the salvation of the Lord. Thus by faith, not by
force, the walls of Jericho fell down. (5.) It was to encourage the hope
of Israel with reference to the remaining difficulties that were before
them. That suggestion of the evil spies that Canaan could never be
conquered because the cities were walled up to heaven ([Deu
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#028).md) would by this be for ever
silenced. The strongest and highest walls cannot hold out against
Omnipotence; they needed not to fight, and therefore needed not to fear,
because God fought for them.

[Joshua 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 6:6</span></span>

We have here an account of the cavalcade which Israel made about
Jericho, the orders Joshua gave concerning it, as he had received them
from the Lord and their punctual observance of these orders. We do not
find that he gave the people the express assurances God had given him
that he would deliver the city into their hands; but he tried whether
they would obey orders with a general confidence that it would end well,
and we find them very observant both of God and Joshua.

I. Wherever the ark went the people attended it, [Jos
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#009.md). The armed men went before it to
clear the way, not thinking it any disparagement to them, though they
were men of war, to be pioneers to the ark of God. If any obstacle
should be found in crossing the roads that led to the city (which they
must do in walking round it) they would remove it; if any opposition
should be made by the enemy, they would encounter it, that the priests'
march with the ark might be easy and safe. It is an honour to the
greatest men to do any good office to the ark and to serve the interests
of religion in their country. The rereward, either another body of armed
men, or Dan's squadron, which marched last through the wilderness, or,
as some think, the multitude of the people who were not armed or
disciplined for war (as many of them as would) followed the ark, to
testify their respect to it, to grace the solemnity, and to be witnesses
of what was done. Every faithful zealous Israelite would be willing to
undergo the same fatigues and run the same hazard with the priests that
bore the ark.

II\. Seven priests went immediately before the ark, having trumpets in
their hands, with which they were continually sounding, [Jos
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#004.md), [Jos
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#005.md), [Jos
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#009.md), [Jos
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#013.md). The priests were God's
ministers, and thus in his name, 1. They proclaimed war with the
Canaanites, and so stuck a terror upon them; for by terrors upon their
spirits they were to be conquered and subdued. Thus God's ministers, by
the solemn declarations of his wrath against all ungodliness and
unrighteousness of men, must blow the trumpet in Zion, and sound an
alarm in the holy mountain, that the sinners in Zion may be afraid. They
are God's heralds to denounce war against all those that go on still in
their trespasses, but say, "We shall have peace, though we go on." 2.
They proclaimed God's gracious presence with Israel, and so put life and
courage into them. It was appointed that when they went to war the
priests should encourage them with the assurance of God's presence with
them, [Deu 20:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#002.md). And particularly
their blowing with trumpets was to be a sign to the people that they
should be remembered before the Lord Their God in the day of battle,
[Num 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#009.md). It encouraged Abijah, [Ch2
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#012.md). Thus God's ministers, by
sounding the Jubilee trumpet of the everlasting gospel, which proclaims
liberty and victory, must encourage the good soldiers of Jesus Christ in
their spiritual warfare.

III\. The trumpets they used were not those silver trumpets which were
appointed to be made for their ordinary service, but trumpets of rams'
horns, bored hollow for the purpose, as some think. These trumpets were
of the basest matter, dullest sound, and least show, that the excellency
of the power might be of God. Thus by the foolishness of preaching,
fitly compared to the sounding of these rams' horns, the devil's kingdom
is thrown down; and the weapons of our warfare, though they are not
carnal nor seem to a carnal eye likely to bring any thing to pass, are
yet mighty through God to the pulling down of strong-holds, [Co2
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#004.md), [Co2
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005.md). The word here is trumpets of
Jobel, that is, such trumpets as they used to blow withal in the year of
jubilee; so many interpreters understand it, as signifying the complete
liberty to which Israel was now brought, and the bringing of the land of
Canaan into the hands of its just and rightful owners.

IV\. All the people were commanded to be silent, not to speak a word,
nor make any noise ([Jos 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#010).md), that
they might the more carefully attend to the sound of the sacred
trumpets, which they were now to look upon as the voice of God among
them; and it does not become us to speak when God is speaking. It
likewise intimates their reverent expectation of the event. [Zac
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#013.md), Be silent, O all flesh, before
the Lord. [Exo 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#014.md), God shall fight,
and you shall hold your peace.

V. They were to do this once a day for six days together and seven times
the seventh day, and they did so, [Jos
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#014.md), [Jos
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#015.md). God could have caused the walls
of Jericho to fall upon the first surrounding of them, but they must go
round them thirteen times before they fall, that they might be kept
waiting patiently for the Lord. Though they had lately come into Canaan,
and their time was very precious (for they had a great deal of work
before them), yet they must linger so many days about Jericho, seeming
to do nothing, nor to make any progress in their business. As promised
deliverances must be expected in God's way, so they must be expected in
his time. He that believes does not make haste, not more haste than God
would have him make. Go yet seven times, before any thing hopeful
appears, [Kg1 18:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#043.md).

VI\. One of these days must needs be a sabbath day, and the Jews say
that it was the last, but this is not certain; however, if he that
appointed them to rest on the other sabbath days appointed them to walk
on this, that was sufficient to justify them in it; he never intended to
bind himself by his own laws, but that when he pleased he might dispense
with them. The impotent man went upon this principle when he argued
([Joh 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#011).md), He that made me whole
(and therefore has a divine power) said unto me, Take up thy bed. And,
in this case here, it was an honour to the sabbath day, by which our
time is divided into weeks, that just seven days were to be spent in
this work, and seven priests were employed to sound seven trumpets, this
number being, on this occasion, as well as many others, made remarkable,
in remembrance of the six day's work of creation and the seventh day's
rest from it. And, besides, the law of the sabbath forbids our own work,
which is servile and secular, but this which they did was a religious
act. It is certainly no breach of the sabbath rest to do the sabbath
work, for the sake of which the rest was instituted; and what is the
sabbath work but to attend the ark in all its motions?

VII\. They continued to do this during the time appointed, and seven
times the seventh day, though they saw not any effect of it, believing
that at the end the vision would speak and not lie, [Hab
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003.md). If we persevere in the way of
duty, we shall lose nothing by it in the long run. It is probable they
walked at such a distance from the walls as to be out of the reach of
the enemies' arrows and out of the hearing of their scoffs. We may
suppose the oddness of the thing did at first amuse the besieged, but by
the seventh day they had grown secure, feeling no harm from that which
perhaps they looked upon as an enchantment. Probably they bantered the
besiegers, as those mentioned in [Neh
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#002.md), "What do these feeble Jews? Is
this the people we thought so formidable? Are these their methods of
attack?" Thus they cried peace and safety, that the destruction might be
the more terrible when it came. Wicked men (says bishop Hall) think God
in jest when he is preparing for their judgment; but they will be
convinced of their mistake when it is too late.

VIII\. At last they were to give a shout, and did so, and immediately
the walls fell, [Jos 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#016.md). This was a
shout for mastery, a triumphant shout; the shout of a king is among
them, [Num 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#021.md). This was a shout of
faith; they believed that the walls of Jericho would fall, and by this
faith the walls were thrown down. It was a shot of prayer, an echo to
the sound of the trumpets which proclaimed the promise that God would
remember them; with one accord, as one man, they cry to heaven for help,
and help comes in. Some allude to this to show that we must never expect
a complete victory over our own corruptions till the very evening of our
last day, and then we shall shout in triumph over them, when we come to
the number and measure of our perfection, as bishop Hall expresses it. A
good heart (says he) groans under the sense of his infirmities, fain
would be rid of them, and strives and prays, but, when all is done,
until the end of the seventh day it cannot be; then judgment shall be
brought forth unto victory. And at the end of time, when our Lord shall
descend from heaven with a shout, and the sound of a trumpet, Satan's
kingdom shall be completely ruined, and not till then, when all opposing
rule, principality, and power, shall be effectually and eternally put
down.

[Joshua 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 6:17</span></span>

The people had religiously observed the orders given them concerning the
besieging of Jericho, and now at length Joshua had told them ([Jos
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#016).md), "The Lord hath given you the
city, enter and take possession." Accordingly in these verses we have,

I. The rules they were to observe in taking possession. God gives it to
them, and therefore may direct it to what uses and intents, and clog it
with what provisos and limitations he thinks fit. It is given to them to
be devoted to God, as the first and perhaps the worst of all the cities
of Canaan. 1. The city must be burnt, and all the lives in it sacrificed
without mercy to the justice of God. All this they knew was included in
those words, [Jos 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#017.md). The city shall
be a cherem, a devoted thing, at and all therein, to the Lord. No life
in it might be ransomed upon any terms; they must all be surely put to
death, [Lev 27:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#029.md). So he appoints from
whom as creatures they had received their lives, and to whom as sinners
they had forfeited them; and who may dispute his sentence? Is God
unrighteous, who thus taketh vengeance? God forbid we should entertain
such a thought! There was more of God seen in the taking of Jericho than
of any other of the cities of Canaan, and therefore that must be more
than any other devoted to him. And the severe usage of this city would
strike a terror upon all the rest and melt their hearts yet more before
Israel. Only, when this severity is ordered, Rahab and her family are
excepted: She shall live and all that are with her. She had
distinguished herself from her neighbours by the kindness she showed to
Israel, and therefore shall be distinguished from them by the speedy
return of that kindness. 2. All the treasure of it, the money and plate
and valuable goods, must be consecrated to the service of the
tabernacle, and brought into the stock of dedicated things, the Jews say
because the city was taken on the sabbath day. Thus God would be
honoured by the beautifying and enriching of his tabernacle; thus
preparation was made for the extraordinary expenses of his service; and
thus the Israelites were taught not to set their hearts upon worldly
wealth nor to aim at heaping up abundance of it for themselves. God had
promised them a land flowing with milk and honey, not a land abounding
with silver and gold; for he would have them live comfortably in it,
that they might serve him cheerfully, but not covet either to trade with
distant countries or to hoard for after times. He would likewise have
them to reckon themselves enriched in the enriching of the tabernacle,
and to think that which was laid up in God's house as truly their honour
and wealth as if it had been laid up in their own. 3. A particular
caution is given them to take heed of meddling with the forbidden spoil;
for what was devoted to God, if they offered to appropriate it to their
own use, would prove accursed to them; therefore ([Jos
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#018).md) "In any wise keep yourselves
from the accursed thing; you will find yourselves inclined to reach
towards it, but check yourselves, and frighten yourselves from having
any thing to do with it." He speaks as if he foresaw the sin of Achan,
which we have an account of in the next chapter, when he gives this
reason for the caution, lest you make the camp of Israel a curse and
trouble it, as it proved that Achan did.

II\. The entrance that was opened to them into the city by the sudden
fall of the walls, or at least that part of the wall over against which
they then were when they gave the shout ([Jos
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#020).md): The wall fell down flat, and
probably killed abundance of people, the guards that stood sentinel upon
it, or others that crowded about it, to look at the Israelites that were
walking round. We read of thousands killed by the fall of a wall, [Kg1
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#030.md). that which they trusted to for
defence proved their destruction. The sudden fall of the wall, no doubt,
put the inhabitants into such a consternation that they had no strength
nor spirit to make any resistance, but they became an easy prey to the
sword of Israel, and saw to how little purpose it was to shut their
gates against a people that had the Lord on the head of them, [Mic
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013.md). Note, The God of heaven easily
can, and certainly will, break down all the opposing power of his and
his church's enemies. Gates of brass and bars of iron are, before him,
but as straw and rotten wood, [Isa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md), [Isa
45:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#002.md). Who will bring me into the
strong city? Wilt not thou, O God? [Psa
60:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#009.md), [Psa
60:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#010.md). Thus shall Satan's kingdom
fall, nor shall any prosper that harden themselves against God.

III\. The execution of the orders given concerning this devoted city.
All that breathed were put to the sword; not only the men that were
found in arms, but the women, and children, and old people. Though they
cried for quarter, and begged ever so earnestly for their lives, there
was no room for compassion, pity must be forgotten: they utterly
destroyed all, [Jos 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#021.md). If they had
not had a divine warrant under the seal of miracles for this execution,
it could not have been justified, nor can it justify the like now, when
we are sure no such warrant can be produced. But, being appointed by the
righteous Judge of heaven and earth to do it, who is not unrighteous in
taking vengeance, they are to be applauded in doing it as the faithful
ministers of his justice. Work for God was then bloody work; and cursed
was he that did it deceitfully, keeping back his sword from blood, [Jer
48:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#010.md). But the spirit of the gospel is
very different, for Christ came not to destroy men's lives but to save
them, [Luk 9:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#056.md). Christ's victories
were of another nature. The cattle were put to death with the owners, as
additional sacrifices to the divine justice. The cattle of the
Israelites, when slain at the altar, were accepted as sacrifices for
them, but the cattle of these Canaanites were required to be slain as
sacrifices with them, for their iniquity was not to be purged with
sacrifice and offering: both were for the glory of God. 2. The city was
burnt with fire, and all that was in it, [Jos
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#024.md). The Israelites, perhaps, when
they had taken Jericho, a large and well-built city, hoped they should
have that for their head-quarters; but God will have them yet to dwell
in tents, and therefore fires this nest, lest they should nestle in it.
3. All the silver and gold, and all those vessels which were capable of
being purified by fire, were brought into the treasury of the house of
the Lord; not that he needed it but that he would be honoured by it, as
the Lord of hosts, of their hosts in particular, the God that gave the
victory and therefore might demand the spoil, either the whole, as here,
or, as sometimes, a tenth, [Heb 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#004.md).

IV\. The preservation of Rahab the harlot, or inn-keeper, who perished
not with those that believed not, [Heb
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#031.md). The public faith was engaged
for her safety by the two spies, who acted therein as public persons;
and therefore, though the hurry they were in at the taking of the town
was no doubt very great, yet Joshua took effectual care for her
preservation. The same persons that she had secured were employed to
secure her, [Jos 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#022.md), [Jos
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#023.md). They were best able to do it who
knew her and her house, and they were fittest to do it, that it might
appear it was for the sake of her kindness to them that she was thus
distinguished and had her life given her for a prey. All her kindred
were saved with her; like Noah she believed to the saving of her house;
and thus faith in Christ brings salvation to the house, [Act
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#031.md). Some ask how her house, which
is said to have been upon the wall ([Jos
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#015).md), escaped falling with the wall;
we are sure it did escape, for she and her relations were safe in it,
either though it joined so near to the wall as to be said to be upon it,
yet it was so far off as not to fall either with the wall or under it;
or, rather, that part of the wall on which her house stood fell not. Now
being preserved alive, 1. She was left for some time without the camp to
be purified from the Gentile superstition, which she was to renounce,
and to be prepared for her admission as a proselyte. 2. She was in due
time incorporated with the church of Israel, and she and her posterity
dwelt in Israel, and her family was remarkable long after. We find her
the wife of Salmon, prince of Judah, mother of Boaz, and named among the
ancestors of our Saviour, [Mat 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#005.md).
Having received Israelites in the name of Israelites, she had an
Israelite's reward. Bishop Pierson observes that Joshua's saving Rahab
the harlot, and admitting her into Israel, were a figure of Christ's
receiving into his kingdom, and entertaining there, the publicans and
the harlots, [Mat 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#031.md). Or it may be
applied to the conversion of the Gentiles.

V. Jericho is condemned to a perpetual desolation, and a curse
pronounced upon the man that at any time hereafter should offer to
rebuild it ([Jos 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#026).md): Joshua adjured
them, that is, the elders and people of Israel, not only by their own
consent, obliging themselves and their posterity never to rebuild this
city, but by the divine appointment, God himself having forbidden it
under the sever penalty here annexed. 1. God would hereby show the
weight of a divine curse; where it rests there is no contending with it
nor getting from under it; it brings ruin without remedy or repair. 2.
He would have it to remain in its ruins a standing monument of his wrath
against the Canaanites when the measure of their iniquity was full, and
of his mercy to his people when the time had come for their settlement
in Canaan. The desolations of their enemies were witnesses of his favour
to them, and would upbraid them with their ingratitude to that God who
had done so much for them. The situation of the city was very pleasant,
and probably its nearness to Jordan was an advantage to it, which would
tempt men to build upon the same spot; but they are here told it is at
their peril if they do it. Men build for their posterity, but he that
builds Jericho shall have no posterity to enjoy what he builds; his
eldest son shall die when he begins the work, and if he take not warning
by that stroke to desist, but will go on presumptuously, the finishing
of his work shall be attended with the funeral of his youngest, and we
must suppose all the rest cut off between. This curse, not being a curse
causeless, did come upon that man who long after rebuilded Jericho ([Kg1
16:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#034).md), but we are not to think it
made the place ever the worse when it was built, or brought any hurt to
those that inhabited it. We find Jericho afterwards graced with the
presence, not only of those two great prophets Elijah and Elisha, but of
our blessed Saviour himself, [Luk
18:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#035.md); [Luk
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#001.md); [Mat
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#029.md). Note, It is a dangerous thing
to attempt the building up of that which God will have to be destroyed.
See [Mal 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#004.md).

Lastly, All this magnified Joshua and raised his reputation ([Jos
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#027).md); it made him not only acceptable
to Israel, but formidable to the Canaanites, because it appeared that
God was with him of a truth: the Word of the Lord was with him, so the
Chaldee, even Christ himself, the same that was with Moses. Nothing can
more raise a man's reputation, nor make him appear more truly great,
than to have the evidences of God's presence with him.
