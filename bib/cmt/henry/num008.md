### [Numbers Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 8:0</span></span>

This chapter is concerning the lamps or lights of the sanctuary. I. The
burning lamps in the candlestick, which the priests were charged to tend
([Num 8:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#001).md). II. The living lamps (if
I may so call them), The Levites, who as ministers were burning and
shining lights. The ordination of the priests we had an account of, Lev.
8. Here we have an account of the ordination of the Levites, the
inferior clergy. 1. How they were purified ([Lev
8:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#005).md). 2. How they were parted with
by the people ([Lev 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#009.md), [Lev
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#010).md). 3. How they were presented to
God in lieu of the firstborn ([Lev
8:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#011).md). 4. How they were consigned
to Aaron and his sons, to be ministers to them ([Lev
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#019).md). 5. How all these orders were
duly executed ([Lev 8:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#020).md). And,
lastly, the age appointed for their ministration ([Lev
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#023), etc..md).

[Numbers 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 8:1</span></span>

Directions were given long before this for the making of the golden
candlestick ([Exo 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031).md), and it was
made according to the pattern shown to Moses in the mount, [Exo
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#017.md). But now it was that the lamps
were first ordered to be lighted, when other things began to be used.
Observe, 1. Who must light the lamps; Aaron himself, he lighted the
lamps, [Num 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#003.md). As the people's
representative to God, he thus did the office of a servant in God's
house, lighting his Master's candle; as the representative of God to the
people, he thus gave them the intimations of God's will and favour, thus
expressed ([Psa 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#028).md), Thou wilt
light my candle; and thus Aaron himself was now lately directed to bless
the people, The Lord make his face to shine upon thee, [Num
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#025.md). The commandment is a lamp, [Pro
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#023.md). The scripture is a light shining
in a dark place, [Pe2 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019.md). And a dark
place indeed even the church would be without it, as the tabernacle
(which had no window in it) without the lamps. Now the work of ministers
is to light these lamps, by expounding and applying the word of God. The
priest lighted the middle lamp from the fire of the altar, and the rest
of the lamps he lighted one from another, which (says Mr. Ainsworth)
signifies that the fountain of all light and knowledge is in Christ, who
has the seven spirits of God figured by the seven lamps of fire ([Rev
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#005).md), but that in the expounding of
scripture one passage must borrow light from another. He also supposes
that, seven being a number of perfection, by the seven branches of the
candlestick is shown the full perfection of the scriptures, which are
able to make us wise to salvation. 2. To what end the lamps were
lighted, that they might give light over against the candlestick, that
is, to that part of the tabernacle where the table stood, with the
show-bread upon it, over against the candlestick. They were not lighted
like tapers in an urn, to burn to themselves, but to give light to the
other side of the tabernacle, for therefore candles are lighted, [Mat
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#015.md). Note, The lights of the world,
the lights of the church, must shine as lights. Therefore we have light,
that we may give light.

[Numbers 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 8:5</span></span>

We read before of the separating of the Levites from among the children
of Israel when they were numbered, and the numbering of them by
themselves ([Num 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#006.md), [Num
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#015).md), that they might be employed in
the service of the tabernacle. Now here we have directions given for
their solemn ordination ([Num 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#006).md),
and the performance of it, [Num 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#020.md).
All Israel must know that they took not this honour to themselves, but
were called of God to it; nor was it enough that they were distinguished
from their neighbours, but they must be solemnly devoted to God. Note,
All that are employed for God must be dedicated to him, according as the
degree of employment is. Christian musts be baptized, ministers must be
ordained; we must first give ourselves unto the Lord, and then our
services. Observe in what method this was done:

I. The Levites must be cleansed, and were so. The rites and ceremonies
of their cleansing were to be performed, 1. By themselves. They must
wash their clothes, and not only bathe, but shave all their flesh, as
the leper was to do when he was cleansed, [Lev
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#008.md). They must cause a razor to pass
over all their flesh, to clear themselves from that defilement which
would not wash off. Jacob, whom God loved, was a smooth man; it was Esau
that was hairy. The great pains they were to take with themselves to
make themselves clean teaches all Christians, and ministers
particularly, by repentance and mortification, to cleanse themselves
from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, that they may perfect holiness.
Those must be clean that bear the vessels of the Lord. 2. By Moses. He
must sprinkle the water of purifying upon them, which was prepared by
divine direction. This signified the application of the blood of Christ
to our souls by faith, to purify us from an evil conscience, that we may
be fit to serve the living God. It is our duty to cleanse ourselves, and
God's promise that he will cleanse us.

II\. The Levites, being thus prepared, must be brought before the Lord
in a solemn assembly of all Israel, and the children of Israel must put
their hands upon them ([Num 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#010).md), so
transferring their interest in them and in their service (to which, as a
part, the whole body of the people was entitled) to God and to his
sanctuary. They presented them to God as living sacrifices, holy and
acceptable, to perform a reasonable service; and therefore, as the
offerers in all other cases did, they laid their hands upon them,
desiring that their service might be accepted in lieu of the attendance
of the whole congregation, particularly the first-born, which they
acknowledge God might have insisted on. This will not serve to prove a
power in the people to ordain ministers; for this imposition of hands by
the children of Israel upon the Levites did not make them ministers of
the sanctuary, but only signified the people's parting with that tribe
out of their militia, and civil incorporations, in order to their being
made ministers by Aaron, who was to offer them before the Lord. All the
congregation of the children of Israel could not lay hands on them, but
it is probable that the rulers and elders did it as the representative
body of the people. Some think that the first-born did it because in
their stead the Levites were consecrated to God. Whatever God calls for
from us to serve his own glory by, we must cheerfully resign it, lay our
hands upon it, not to detain it but to surrender it, and let it go to
him that is entitled to it.

III\. Sacrifices were to be offered for them, a sin-offering first ([Num
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#012).md), and then a burnt-offering, to
make an atonement for the Levites, who, as the parties concerned, were
to lay their hands upon the head of the sacrifices. See here, 1. That we
are all utterly unworthy and unfit to be admitted into and employed in
the service of God, till atonement be made for sin, and thereby our
peace made with God. That interposing cloud must be scattered before
there can be any comfortable communion settled between God and our
souls. 2. That it is by sacrifice, by Christ the great sacrifice, that
we are reconciled to God, and made fit to be offered to him. It is by
him that Christians are sanctified to the work of their Christianity,
and ministers to the work of their ministry. The learned bishop
Patrick's notion of the sacrifice offered by the Levites is that the
Levites were themselves considered as an expiatory sacrifice, for they
were given to make atonement for the children of Israel, ([Num
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#019).md), and yet not being devoted to
death, any more than the first-born were, these two sacrifices were
substituted in their stead, upon which therefore they were to lay their
hands, that the sin which the children of Israel laid upon them ([Num
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#010).md) might be transferred to these
beasts.

IV\. The Levites themselves were offered before the Lord for an offering
of the children of Israel, [Num 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#011.md).
Aaron gave them up to God, as being first given up by themselves, and by
the children of Israel. The original word signifies a wave-offering, not
that they were actually waved, but they were presented to God as the God
of heaven, and the Lord of the whole earth, as the wave-offerings were.
And in calling them wave-offerings it was intimated to them that they
must continually lift up themselves towards God in his service, lift up
their eyes, lift up their hearts, and must move to and fro with
readiness in the business of their profession. They were not ordained to
be idle, but to be active and stirring.

V. God here declares his acceptance of them: The Levites shall be mine,
[Num 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#014.md). God took them instead of
the first-born ([Num 8:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#016).md), of
which before, [Num 3:41](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#041.md). Note, What is
in sincerity offered to God shall be graciously owned and accepted by
him. And his ministers who have obtained mercy of him to be faithful
have particular marks of favour and honour put upon them: they shall be
mine, and then ([Num 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#015).md) they shall
go in to do the service of the tabernacle. God takes them for his own,
that they may serve him. All that expect to share in the privileges of
the tabernacle must resolve to do the service of the tabernacle. As, on
the one hand, none of God's creatures are his necessary servants (he
needs not the service of any of them), so, on the other hand, none are
taken merely as honorary servants, to do nothing. All whom God owns he
employs; angels themselves have their services.

VI\. They are then given as a gift to Aaron and his sons ([Num
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#019).md), yet so as that the benefit
accrued to the children of Israel. 1. The Levites must act under the
priests as attendants on them, and assistants to them, in the service of
the sanctuary. Aaron offers them to God ([Num
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#011).md), and then God gives them back to
Aaron, [Num 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#019.md). Note, Whatever we
give up to God, he will give back to us unspeakably to our advantage.
Our hearts, our children, our estates, are never more ours, more truly,
more comfortably ours, than when we have offered them up to God. 2. They
must act for the people. They were taken to do the service of the
children of Israel, that is, not only to do the service which they
should do, but to serve their interests, and do that which would really
redound to the honour, safety, and prosperity of the whole nation. Note,
Those that faithfully perform the service of God do one of the best
services that can be done to the public; God's ministers, while they
keep within the sphere of their office and conscientiously discharge the
duty of it, must be looked upon as some of the most useful servants of
their country. The children of Israel can as ill spare the tribe of Levi
as any of their tribes. But what is the service they do the children of
Israel? It follows, it is to make an atonement for them, that there be
no plague among them. It was the priests' work to make atonement by
sacrifice, but the Levites made atonement by attendance, and preserved
the peace with heaven which was made by sacrifice. If the service of the
priests in the tabernacle had been left to all the first-born of Israel
promiscuously, it would have been either neglected or done unskillfully
and irreverently, being done by those that were not so closely tied to
it, nor so diligently trained to it, nor so constantly used to it, as
the Levites were; and this would bring a plague among the children of
Israel - meaning, perhaps, the death of the first-born themselves, which
was the last and greatest of the plagues of Egypt. To prevent this, and
to preserve the atonement, the Levites were appointed to do this
service, who should be bred up to it under their parents from their
infancy, and therefore would be well versed in it; and so the children
of Israel, that is, the first-born, should not need to come nigh to the
sanctuary; or, when any Israelites had occasion, the Levites would be
ready to instruct them, and introduce them, and so prevent any fatal
miscarriage or mistake. Note, It is a very great kindness to the church
that ministers are appointed to go before the people in the things of
God, as guides, overseers, and rulers, in religious worship, and to make
that their business. When Christ ascended on high, he gave these gifts,
[Eph 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008.md), [Eph
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011.md), [Eph
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#012.md).

VII\. The time of their ministration is fixed. 1. They were to enter
upon the service at twenty-five years old, [Num
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#024.md). They were not charged with the
carrying of the tabernacle and the utensils of it till they were thirty
years old, [Num 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#003.md). But they were
entered to be otherwise serviceable at twenty-five years old, a very
good age for ministers to begin their public work at. The work then
required that strength of body and the work now requires that maturity
of judgment and steadiness of behaviour which men rarely arrive at till
about that age; and novices are in danger of being lifted up with pride.
2. They were to have a writ of ease at fifty years old; then they were
to return from the warfare, as the phrase is ([Num
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#025).md), not cashiered with disgrace,
but preferred rather to the rest which their age required, to be loaded
with the honours of their office, as hitherto they had been with the
burdens of it. They shall minister with their brethren in the
tabernacle, to direct the junior Levites, and set them in; and they
shall keep the charge, as guards upon the avenues of the tabernacle, to
see that no stranger intruded, nor any person in his uncleanness, but
they shall not be put upon any service which may be a fatigue to them.
If God's grace provide that men shall have ability according to their
work, man's prudence should take care that men have work only according
to their ability. The aged are most fit for trusts, and to keep the
charge; the younger are most fit for work, and to do the service. Those
that have used the office of a servant well purchase to themselves a
good degree, [Ti1 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#013.md). Yet indeed
gifts are not tied to ages ([Job
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#009).md), but all these worketh that one
and the self-same Spirit. Thus was the affair of the Levites settled.
