### [Numbers Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 14:0</span></span>

This chapter gives us an account of that fatal quarrel between God and
Israel upon which, for their murmuring and unbelief, he swore in his
wrath that they should not enter into his rest. Here is, I. The mutiny
and rebellion of Israel against God, upon the report of the evil spies
([Num 14:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#001).md). II. The fruitless
endeavour of Moses and Aaron, Caleb and Joshua, to still the tumult
([Num 14:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#005).md). III. Their utter ruin
justly threatened by an offended God ([Num
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#011.md), [Num
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#012).md). IV. The humble intercession of
Moses for them ([Num 14:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#013).md). V. A
mitigation of the sentence in answer to the prayer of Moses; they shall
not all be cut off, but the decree goes forth ratified with an oath,
published to the people, again and again repeated, that this whole
congregation should perish in the wilderness, and none of them enter
Canaan but Caleb and Joshua only (v. 20-35). VI. The present death of
the evil spies ([Num 14:36-39](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#036).md). VII.
The rebuke given to those who attempted to go forward notwithstanding
([Num 14:40-45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#040).md). And this is written
for our admonition, that we "fall not after the same example of
unbelief."

[Numbers 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 14:1</span></span>

Here we see what mischief the evil spies made by their unfair
representation. We may suppose that these twelve that were impanelled to
enquire concerning Canaan had talked it over among themselves before
they brought in their report in public; and Caleb and Joshua, it is
likely, had done their utmost to bring the rest over to be of their
mind, and if they would but have agreed that Caleb, according to his
pose, should have spoken for them all, as their foreman, all had been
well; but the evil spies, it should seem, wilfully designed to raise
this mutiny, purely in opposition to Moses and Aaron, though they could
not propose any advantage to themselves by it, unless they hoped to be
captains and commanders of the retreat into Egypt they were now
meditating. But what came of it? Here in these verses we find those whom
they studied to humour put into a vexation, and, before the end of the
chapter, brought to ruin. Observe,

I. How the people fretted themselves: They lifted up their voices and
cried ([Num 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#001).md); giving credit to
the report of the spies rather than to the word of God, and imagining
their condition desperate, they laid the reins on the neck of their
passions, and could keep no manner of temper. Like foolish froward
children, they fall a crying, yet know not what they cry for. It would
have been time enough to cry out when the enemy had beaten up their
quarters, and they had seen the sons of Anak at the gate of their camp;
but those that cried when nothing hurt them deserved to have something
given them to cry for. And, as if all had been already gone, they sat
down and wept that night. Note, Unbelief, or distrust of God, is a sin
that is its own punishment. Those that do not trust God are continually
vexing themselves. The world's mourners are more than God's, and the
sorrow of the world worketh death.

II\. How they flew in the face of their governors - murmured against
Moses and Aaron, and in them reproached the Lord, [Num
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#002.md), [Num
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#003.md). The congregation of elders began
the discontent ([Num 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#001).md), but the
contagion soon spread through the whole camp, for the children of Israel
murmured. Jealousies and discontents spread like wildfire among the
unthinking multitude, who are easily taught to despise dominions, and to
speak evil of dignities. 1. They look back with a causeless discontent.
They wish that they had died in Egypt with the first-born that were
slain there, or in the wilderness with those that lately died of the
plague for lusting. See the prodigious madness of unbridled passions,
which make men prodigal even of that which nature accounts most dear,
life itself. Never were so many months spent so pleasantly as these
which they had spent since they came out of Egypt, loaded with honours,
compassed with favours, and continually entertained with something or
other that was surprising; and yet, as if all these things had not made
it worth their while to live, they wished they had died in Egypt. And
such a light opinion they had of God's tremendous judgments executed on
their neighbours for their sin that they wished they had shared with
them in their plagues, rather than run the hazard of making a descent
upon Canaan. They wish rather to die criminals under God's justice than
live conquerors in his favour. Some read it, O that we had died in
Egypt, or in the wilderness! O that we might die! They wish to die, for
fear of dying; and have not sense enough to reason as the poor lepers,
when rather than die upon the spot they ventured into an enemy's camp,
If they kill us, we shall but die, [Kg2
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#004.md). How base were the spirits of
these degenerate Israelites, who, rather than die (if it come to the
worst) like soldiers on the bed of honour, with their swords in their
hands, desire to die like rotten sheep in the wilderness. 2. They look
forward with a groundless despair, taking it for granted ([Num
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#003).md) that if they went on they must
fall by the sword, and pretend to lay the cause of their fear upon the
great care they had for their wives and children, who, they conclude,
will be a prey to the Canaanites. And here is a most wicked blasphemous
reflection upon God himself, as if he had brought them hither on purpose
that they might fall by the sword, and that their wives and children,
those poor innocents, should be a prey. Thus do they, in effect, charge
that God who is love itself with the worst of malice, and eternal Truth
with the basest hypocrisy, suggesting that all the kind things he had
said to them, and done for them, hitherto, were intended only to decoy
them into a snare, and to cover a secret design carried on all along to
ruin them. Daring impudence! But what will not that tongue speak against
heaven that is set on fire of hell? The devil keeps up his interest in
the hearts of men by insinuating to them ill thoughts of God, as if he
desired the death of sinners, and delighted in the hardships and
sufferings of his own servants, whereas he knows his thoughts to us-ward
(whether we know them so or no) to be thoughts of good, and not of evil,
[Jer 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#011.md).

III\. How they came at last to this desperate resolve, that, instead of
going forward to Canaan, they would go back again to Egypt. The motion
is first made by way of query only ([Num
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#003).md): Were it not better for us to
return into Egypt? But the ferment being high, and the spirits of the
people being disposed to entertain any thing that was perverse, it soon
ripened to a resolution, without a debate ([Num
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#004).md): Let us make a captain and
return to Egypt; and it is lamented long after ([Neh
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#017).md) that in their rebellion they
appointed a captain to return to their bondage; for they knew Moses
would not be their captain in this retreat. Now, 1. It was the greatest
folly in the world to wish themselves in Egypt, or to think that if they
were there it would be better with them than it was. If they durst not
go forward to Canaan, yet better be as they were than go back to Egypt.
What did they want? What had they to complain of? They had plenty, and
peace, and rest, were under a good government, had good company, had the
tokens of God's presence with them, and enough to make them easy even in
the wilderness, if they had but hearts to be content. But whither were
they thus eager to go to better themselves? To Egypt! Had they so soon
forgotten the sore bondage they were in there? Would they be again under
the tyranny of their taskmasters, and at the drudgery of making brick?
And, after all the plagues which Egypt had suffered for their sakes,
could they expect any better treatment there than they had formerly, and
not rather much worse? In how little time (not a year and a half) have
they forgotten all the sighs of their bondage, and all the songs of
their deliverance! Like brute-beasts, they mind only what is present,
and their memories, with the other powers of reason, are sacrificed to
their passions. See [Psa 106:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#007.md). We
find it threatened ([Deu 28:68](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#068).md), as
the completing of their misery, that they should be brought into Egypt
again, and yet this is what they here wish for. Sinners are enemies to
themselves; and those that walk not in God's counsels consult their own
mischief and ruin. 2. It was a most senseless ridiculous thing to talk
of returning thither through the wilderness. Could they expect that
God's cloud would lead them or his manna attend them? And, if they did
not, the thousands of Israel must unavoidably be lost and perish in the
wilderness. Suppose the difficulties of conquering Canaan were as great
as they imagined, those of returning to Egypt were much greater. In this
let us see, (1.) The folly of discontent and impatience under the
crosses of our outward condition. We are uneasy at that which is,
complain of our place and lot, and we would shift; but is there any
place or condition in this world that has not something in it to make us
uneasy if we are disposed to be so? The way to better our condition is
to get our spirits into a better frame; and instead of asking, "Were it
not better to go to Egypt?" ask, "Were it not better to be content, and
make the best of that which is?" (2.) The folly of apostasy from the
ways of God. Heaven is the Canaan set before us, a land flowing with
milk and honey; those that bring up ever so ill a report of it cannot
but say that it is indeed a good land, only it is hard to get to it.
Strict and serious godliness is looked upon as an impracticable thing,
and this deters many who began well from going on; rather than undergo
the imaginary hardships of a religious life, they run themselves upon
the certain fatal consequences of a sinful course; and so they
transcribe the folly of Israel, who, when they were within a step of
Canaan, would make a captain, and return to Egypt.

[Numbers 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 14:5</span></span>

The friends of Israel here interpose to save them if possible from
ruining themselves, but in vain. The physicians of their state would
have healed them, but they would not be healed; their watchmen gave them
warning, but they would not take warning, and so their blood is upon
their own heads.

I. The best endeavours were used to still the tumult, and, if now at
last they would have understood the things that belonged to their peace,
all the following mischief would have been prevented.

1\. Moses and Aaron did their part, [Num
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#005.md). Though it was against them that
they murmured ([Num 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#002).md), yet they
bravely overlooked the affront and injury done them, and approved
themselves faithful friends to those who were outrageous enemies to
them. The clamour and noise of the people were so great that Moses and
Aaron could not be heard; should they order any of their servants to
proclaim silence, the angry multitude would perhaps be the more
clamorous; and therefore, to gain audience in the sight of all the
assembly, they fell on their faces, thus expressing, (1.) Their humble
prayers to God to still the noise of this sea, the noise of its waves,
even the tumult of the people. (2.) The great trouble and concern of
their own spirits. They fell down as men astonished and even
thunder-struck, amazed to see a people throw away their own mercies: to
see those so ill-humoured who were so well taught. And, (3.) Their great
earnestness with the people to cease their murmurings; they hoped to
work upon them by this humble posture, and to prevail with them not to
persist in their rebellion; Moses and Aaron beseech them, as though by
them God himself did beseech them, to be reconciled unto God. What they
said to the people Moses relates in the repetition of this story. [Deu
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#029.md), [Deu
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#030.md), Be not afraid; the Lord your God
shall fight for you. Note, Those that are zealous friends to precious
souls will stoop to any thing for their salvation. Moses and Aaron,
notwithstanding the posts of honour they are in, prostrate themselves to
the people to beg of them not to ruin themselves.

2\. Caleb and Joshua did their part: they rent their clothes in a holy
indignation at the sin of the people, and a holy dread of the wrath of
God, which they saw ready to break out against them. it was the greater
trouble to these good men because the tumult was occasioned by those
spies with whom they had been joined in commission; and therefore they
thought themselves obliged to do what they could to still the storm
which their fellows had raised. No reasoning could be more pertinent and
pathetic than theirs was ([Num
14:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#007).md), and they spoke as with
authority.

(1.) They assured them of the goodness of the land they had surveyed,
and that it was really worth venturing for, and not a land that ate up
the inhabitants, as the evil spies had represented it. It is an
exceedingly good land ([Num 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#007).md); it
is very, very good, so the word is; so that they had no reason to
despise this pleasant land. Note, If men were but thoroughly convinced
of the desirableness of the gains of religion, they would not stick at
the services of it.

(2.) They made nothing of the difficulties that seemed to lie in the way
of their gaining the possession of it: "Fear not the people of the land,
[Num 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#009.md). Whatever formidable ideas
have been given you of them, the lion is not so fierce as he is painted.
They are bread for us," that is, "they are set before us rather to be
fed upon than to be fought with, so easily, so pleasantly, and with so
much advantage to ourselves shall we master them." Pharaoh is said to
have been given them for meat ([Psa
74:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#014).md), and the Canaanites will be so
too. They show that, whatever was suggested to the contrary, the
advantage was clear on Israel's side. For, \[1.\] Though the Canaanites
dwell in walled cities, they are naked: Their defence has departed from
them; that common providence which preserves the rights of nations has
abandoned them, and will be no shelter nor protection to them. The other
spies took notice of their strength, but these of their wickedness, and
thence inferred that God had forsaken them, and therefore their defence
had departed. No people can be safe when they have provoked God to leave
them. \[2.\] Though Israel dwell in tents they are fortified: The Lord
is with us, and his name is a strong tower; fear them not. Note, While
we have the presence of God with us, we need not fear the most powerful
force against us.

(3.) They showed them plainly that all the danger they were in was from
their own discontents, and that they would succeed against all their
enemies if they did not make God their enemy. On this point alone the
cause would turn ([Num 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#008).md): "If the
Lord delight in us, as certainly he does, and will if we do not provoke
him, he will bring us into this good land; we shall without fail get it
in possession by his favour, and the light of his countenance ([Psa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003).md), if we do not forfeit his favour
and by our own follies turn away our own mercies." It has come to this
issue ([Num 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#009).md): Only rebel not you
against the Lord. Note, Nothing can ruin sinners but their own
rebellion. If God leave them, it is because they drive him from them;
and they die because they will die. None are excluded the heavenly
Canaan but those that exclude themselves. And, now, could the case have
been made more plain? could it have been urged more closely? But what
was the effect?

II\. It was all to no purpose; they were deaf to this fair reasoning;
nay, they were exasperated by it, and grew more outrageous: All the
congregation bade stone them with stones, [Num
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#010.md). The rulers of the congregation,
and the great men (so bishop Patrick), ordered the common people to fall
upon them, and knock their brains out. Their case was sad indeed when
their leaders thus caused them to err. Note, It is common for those
whose hearts are fully set in them to do evil to rage at those who give
them good counsel. Those who hate to be reformed hate those that would
reform them, and count them their enemies because they tell them the
truth. Thus early did Israel begin to misuse the prophets, and stone
those that were sent to them, and it was this that filled the measure of
their sin, [Mat 23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md). Stone them with
stones! Why, what evil have they done? No crime can be laid to their
charge; but the truth is these two witnesses tormented those that were
obstinate in their infidelity, [Rev
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#010.md). Caleb and Joshua had but just
said, The Lord is with us; fear them not ([Num
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#009).md): and, if Israel will not apply
those encouraging words to their own fears, those that uttered them know
how to encourage themselves with them against this enraged multitude
that spoke of stoning them, as David in a like cause, [Sa1
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#006.md). Those that cannot prevail to
edify others with their counsels and comforts should endeavour at least
to edify themselves. Caleb and Joshua knew they appeared for God and his
glory, and therefore doubted not but God would appear for them and their
safety. And they were not disappointed, for immediately the glory of the
Lord appeared, to the terror and confusion of those that were for
stoning the servants of God. When they reflected upon God ([Num
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#003).md), his glory appeared not to
silence their blasphemies; but, when they threatened Caleb and Joshua,
they touched the apple of his eye, and his glory appeared immediately.
Note, Those who faithfully expose themselves for God are sure to be
taken under his special protection, and shall be hidden from the rage of
men, either under heaven or in heaven.

[Numbers 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 14:11</span></span>

Here is, I. The righteous sentence which God gave against Israel for
their murmuring and unbelief, which, though afterwards mitigated, showed
what was the desert of their sin and the demand of injured justice, and
what would have been done if Moses had not interposed. When the glory of
the Lord appeared in the tabernacle we may suppose that Moses took it
for a call to him immediately to come and attend there, as before the
tabernacle was erected he went up to the mount in a similar case, [Exo
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#030.md). Thus, while the people were
studying to disgrace him, God publicly put honour upon him, as the man
of his counsel. Now here we are told what God said to him there.

1\. He showed him the great evil of the people's sin, [Num
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#011.md). What passed between God and
Israel went through the hands of Moses: when they were displeased with
God they told Moses of it ([Num 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#002).md);
when God was displeased with them he told Moses too, revealing his
secret to his servant the prophet, [Amo
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#007.md). Two things God justly complains
of to Moses: - (1.) Their sin. They provoke me, or (as the word
signifies) they reject, reproach, despise me, for they will not believe
me. This was the bitter root which bore the gall and wormwood. It was
their unbelief that made this a day of provocation in the wilderness,
[Heb 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#008.md). Note, Distrust of God, of
his power and promise, is itself a very great provocation, and at the
bottom of many other provocations. Unbelief is a great sin ([Jo1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#010).md), and a root sin, [Heb
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#012). (2..md) Their continuance in it:
How long will they do so? Note, The God of heaven keeps an account how
long sinners persist in their provocations; and the longer they persist
the more he is displeased. The aggravations of their sin were, \[1.\]
Their relation to God: This people, a peculiar people, a professing
people. The nearer any are to God in name and profession, the more he is
provoked by their sins, especially their unbelief. \[2.\] The experience
they had had of God's power and goodness, in all the signs which he had
shown among them, by which, one would think, he had effectually obliged
them to trust him and follow him. The more God has done for us the
greater is the provocation if we distrust him.

2\. He showed him the sentence which justice passed upon them for it,
[Num 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#012.md). "What remains now but that
I should make a full end of them? It will soon be done. I will smite
them with the pestilence, not leave a man of them alive, but wholly blot
out their name and race, and so disinherit them, and be no more troubled
with them. Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries. They wish to die; and
let them die, and neither root nor branch be left of them. Such
rebellious children deserve to be disinherited." And if it be asked,
"What will become of God's covenant with Abraham then?" here is an
answer, "I shall be preserved in the family of Moses: I will make of
thee a greater nation." Thus, (1.) God would try Moses, whether he still
continued that affection for Israel which he formerly expressed upon a
like occasion, in preferring their interests before the advancement of
his own family; and it is proved that Moses was still of the same public
spirit, and could not bear the thought of raising his own name upon the
ruin of the name of Israel. (2.) God would teach us that he will not be
a loser by the ruin of sinners. If Adam and Eve had been cut off and
disinherited, he could have made another Adam and another Eve, and have
glorified his mercy in them, as here he could have glorified his mercy
in Moses, though Israel had been ruined.

II\. The humble intercession Moses made for them. Their sin had made a
fatal breach in the wall of their defence, at which destruction would
certainly have entered if Moses had not seasonably stepped in and made
it good. Here he was a type of Christ, who interceded for his
persecutors, and prayed for those that despitefully used him, leaving us
an example to his own rule, [Mat 5:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044.md).

1\. The prayer of his petition is, in one word, Pardon, I beseech thee,
the iniquity of this people ([Num
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#019).md), that is, "Do not bring upon
them the ruin they deserve." This was Christ's prayer for those that
crucified him, Father forgive them. The pardon of a national sin, as
such, consists in the turning away of the national punishment; and that
is it for which Moses is here so earnest.

2\. The pleas are many, and strongly urged.

(1.) He insists most upon the plea that is taken from the glory of God,
[Num 14:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#013.md). With this he begins,
and somewhat abruptly, taking occasion from that dreadful word, I will
disinherit them. Lord (says he), then the Egyptians shall hear it. God's
honour lay nearer to his heart than any interests of his own. Observe
how he orders this cause before God. He pleads, \[1.\] That the eyes
both of Egypt and Canaan were upon them, and great expectations were
raised concerning them. They could not but have heard that thou, Lord,
art among this people, [Num 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#014.md). The
neighbouring countries rang of it, how much this people were the
particular care of heaven, so as never any people under the sun were.
\[2.\] That if they should be cut off great notice would be taken of it.
"The Egyptians will hear it ([Num
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#013).md), for they have their spies
among us, and they will tell it to the inhabitants of the land" ([Num
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#014).md); for there was great
correspondence between Egypt and Canaan, although not by the way of this
wilderness. "If this people that have made so great a noise be all
consumed, if their mighty pretensions come to nothing, and their light
go out in a snuff, it will be told with pleasure in Gath, and published
in the streets of Askelon; and what construction will the heathen put
upon it? It will be impossible to make them understand it as an act of
God's justice, and as such redounding to God's honour; brutish men know
not this ([Psa 92:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#006).md): but they will
impute it to the failing of God's power, and so turn it to his reproach,
[Num 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#016.md). They will say, He slew
them in the wilderness because he was not able to bring them to Canaan,
his arm being shortened, and his stock of miracles being spent. Now,
Lord, let not one attribute be glorified at the expense of another;
rather let mercy rejoice against judgment than that almighty power
should be impeached." Note, The best pleas in prayer are those that are
taken from God's honour; for they agree with the first petition of the
Lord's Prayer, Hallowed be thy name. Do not disgrace the throne of thy
glory. God pleads it with himself ([Deu
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#027).md), I feareth the wrath of the
enemy; and we should use it as an argument with ourselves to walk so in
every thing as to give no occasion to the enemies of the Lord to
blaspheme, [Ti1 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001.md).

(2.) He pleads God's proclamation of his name at Horeb ([Num
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#017.md), [Num
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#018).md): Let the power of the Lord be
great. Power is here put for pardoning mercy; it is his power over his
own anger. If he should destroy them, God's power would be questioned;
if he should continue and complete their salvation, notwithstanding the
difficulties that arose, not only from the strength of their enemies,
but from their own provocations, this would greatly magnify the divine
power: what cannot he do who could make so weak a people conquerors and
such an unworthy people favourites? The more danger there is of others
reproaching God's power the more desirous we should be to see it
glorified. To enforce this petition, he refers to the word which God had
spoken: The Lord is long-suffering and of great mercy. God's goodness
had there been spoken of as his glory; God gloried in it, [Exo
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006.md), [Exo
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#007.md). Now here he prays that upon this
occasion he would glorify it. Note, We must take our encouragement in
prayer from the word of God, upon which he has caused us to hope, [Psa
119:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#049.md). "Lord, be and do according as
thou hast spoken; for hast thou spoken, and wilt thou not make it good?"
Three things God had solemnly made a declaration of, which Moses here
fastens upon, and improves for the enforcing of his petition: - \[1.\]
The goodness of God's nature in general, that he is long-suffering, or
slow to anger, and of great mercy; not soon provoked, but tender and
compassionate towards offenders. \[2.\] His readiness in particular to
pardon sin: Forgiving iniquity and transgression, sins of all sorts.
\[3.\] His unwillingness to proceed to extremity, even when he does
punish. For in this sense the following words may be read: That will by
no means make quite desolate, in visiting the iniquity of the fathers
upon the children. God had indeed said in the second commandment that he
would thus visit, but here he promises not to make a full end of
families, churches, and nations, at once; and so it is very applicable
to this occasion, for Moses cannot beg that God would not at all punish
this sin (it would be too great an encouragement to rebellion if he
should set no mark of his displeasure upon it), but that he would not
kill all this people as one man, [Num
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#015.md). He does not ask that they may
not be corrected, but that they may not be disinherited. And this
proclamation of God's name was the more apposite to his purpose because
it was made upon occasion of the pardoning of their sin in making the
golden calf. This sin which they had now fallen into was bad enough, but
it was not idolatry.

(3.) He pleads past experience: As thou hast forgiven this people from
Egypt, [Num 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#019.md). This seemed to make
against him. Why should those be forgiven any more who, after they had
been so often forgiven, revolted yet more and more, and seemed hardened
and encouraged in their rebellion by the lenity and patience of their
God, and the frequent pardons they had obtained? Among men it would have
been thought impolitic to take notice of such a circumstance in a
request of this nature, as it might operate to the prejudice of the
petitioner: but, as in other things so in pardoning sin, God's thoughts
and ways are infinitely above ours, [Isa
55:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#009.md). Moses looks upon it as a good
plea, Lord, forgive, as thou hast forgiven. It will be no more a
reproach to thy justice, nor any less the praise of thy mercy, to
forgive now, than it has been formerly. Therefore the sons of Jacob are
not consumed, because they have to do with a God that changes not, [Mal
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006.md).

[Numbers 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 14:20</span></span>

We have here God's answer to the prayer of Moses, which sings both of
mercy and judgment. It is given privately to Moses ([Num
14:20-25](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#020).md), and then directed to be
made public to the people, [Num
14:26-35](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#026.md). The frequent repetitions of
the same things in it speak these resolves to be unalterable. Let us see
the particulars.

I. The extremity of the sentence is receded from ([Num
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#020).md): "I have pardoned, so as not to
cut them all off at once, and disinherit them." See the power of prayer,
and the delight God takes in putting an honour upon it. He designed a
pardon, but Moses shall have the praise of obtaining it by prayer: it
shall be done according to thy word; thus, as a prince, he has power
with God, and prevails. See what countenance and encouragement God gives
to our intercessions for others, that we may be public-spirited in
prayer. Here is a whole nation rescued from ruin by the effectual
fervent prayer of one righteous man. See how ready God is to forgive
sin, and how easy to be entreated: Pardon, says Moses ([Num
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#019).md); I have pardoned, says God,
[Num 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#020.md). David found him thus swift
to show mercy, [Psa 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005.md). He deals not
with us after our sins, [Psa 103:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#010.md).

II\. The glorifying of God's name is, in the general, resolved upon,
[Num 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#021.md). It is said, it is sworn,
All the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord. Moses in his
prayer had shown a great concern for the glory of God. "Let me alone,"
says God, "to secure that effectually, and to advance it, by this
dispensation." All the world shall see how God hates sin even in his own
people, and will reckon for it, and yet how gracious and merciful he is,
and how slow to anger. Thus when our Saviour prayed, Father, glorify thy
name, he was immediately answered, I have glorified it, and will glorify
it yet again, [Joh 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#028.md). Note, Those
that sincerely seek God's glory may be sure of what they seek. God
having turned this prayer for the glorifying of himself into a promise,
we may turn it into praise, in concert with the angels, [Isa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003.md), The earth is full of his glory.

III\. The sin of this people which provoked God to proceed against them
is here aggravated, [Num 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#022.md), [Num
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#027.md). It is not made worse than
really it was, but is shown to be exceedingly sinful. It was an evil
congregation, each bad, but altogether in congregation, very bad. 1.
They tempted God - tempted his power, whether he could help them in
their straits - his goodness, whether he would - and his faithfulness,
whether his promise would be performed. They tempted his justice,
whether he would resent their provocations and punish them or no. They
dared him, and in effect challenged him, as God does the idols ([Isa
41:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#023).md), to do good, or do evil. 2.
They murmured against him. This is much insisted on, [Num
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#027.md). As they questioned what he
would do, so they quarrelled with him for every thing he did or had
done, continually fretting and finding fault. It does not appear that
they murmured at any of the laws or ordinances that God gave them
(though they proved a heavy yoke), but they murmured at the conduct they
were under, and the provision made for them. Note, It is much easier to
bring ourselves to the external services of religion, and observe all
the formalities of devotion, than to live a life of dependence upon, and
submission to, the divine Providence in the course of our conversation.
3. They did this after they had seen God's miracles in Egypt and in the
wilderness, [Num 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#002.md). They would not
believe their own eyes, which were witnesses for God that he was in the
midst of them of a truth. 4. They had repeated the provocations ten
times, that is, very often: the Jewish writers reckon this exactly the
tenth time that the body of the congregation had provoked God. First, at
the Red Sea, [Exo 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#011.md). In Marah,
[Exo 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#023.md), [Exo
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#024.md). In the wilderness of Sin, [Exo
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#002.md). At Rephidim, [Exo
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001.md), [Exo
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#002.md). The golden calf, Ex. 32. Then at
Taberah. Then at Kibroth-Hattaavah, ch. 11. And so this was the tenth.
Note, God keeps an account how often we repeat our provocations, and
will sooner or later set them in order before us. 5. They had not
hearkened to his voice, though he had again and again admonished them of
their sin.

IV\. The sentence passed upon them for this sin. 1. That they should not
see the promised land ([Num 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#023).md),
nor come into it, [Num 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#030.md). He swore
in his wrath that they should not enter into his rest, [Psa
95:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#011.md). Note, Disbelief of the promise
is a forfeiture of the benefit of it. Those that despise the pleasant
land shall be shut out of it. The promise of God should be fulfilled to
their posterity, but not to them. 2. That they should immediately turn
back into the wilderness, [Num 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#025.md).
Their next remove should be a retreat. They must face about, and instead
of going forward to Canaan, on the very borders of which they now were,
they must withdraw towards the Red Sea again. Tomorrow turn you; that
is, "Very shortly you shall be brought back to that vast howling
wilderness which you are so weary of. And it is time to shift for your
own safety, for the Amalekites lie in wait in the valley, ready to
attack you if you march forward." Of them they had been distrustfully
afraid ([Num 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#029).md), and now with them
God justly frightened them. The fear of the wicked shall come upon him.
3. That all those who had now grown up to men's estate should die in the
wilderness, not all at once, but by degrees. They wished that they might
die in the wilderness, and God said Amen to their passionate wish, and
made their sin their ruin, snared them in the words of their mouth, and
caused their own tongue to fall upon them, took them at their word, and
determined that their carcases should fall in the wilderness, [Num
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#028.md), [Num
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#029.md), and again, [Num
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#032.md), [Num
14:35](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#035.md). See with what contempt they are
spoken of, now that they had by their sin made themselves vile; the
mighty men of valour were but carcases, when the Spirit of the Lord had
departed from them. They were all as dead men. Their fathers had such a
value for Canaan that they desired to have their dead bodies carried
thither to be buried, in token of their dependence upon God's promise
that they should have that land for a possession: but these, having
despised that good land and disbelieved the promise of it, shall not
have the honour to be buried in it, but shall have their graves in the
wilderness. 4. That in pursuance of this sentence they should wander to
and fro in the wilderness, like travellers that have lost themselves,
for forty years; that is, so long as to make it full forty years from
their coming out of Egypt to their entrance into Canaan, [Num
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#033.md), [Num
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#034.md). Thus long they were kept
wandering, (1.) To answer the number of the days in which the spies were
searching the land. They were content to wait forty days for the
testimony of men, because they could not take God's word; and therefore
justly are they kept forty years waiting for the performance of God's
promise. (2.) That hereby they might be brought to repentance, and find
mercy with God in the other world, whatever became of them in this. Now
they had time to bethink themselves, and to consider their ways; and the
inconveniences of the wilderness would help to humble them and prove
them, and show them what was in their heart, [Deu
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#002.md). Thus long they bore their
iniquities, feeling the weight of God's wrath in the punishment. They
were made to groan under the burden of their own sin that brought it
upon them, which was too heavy for them to bear. (3.) That they might
sensibly feel what a dangerous thing it is for God's covenant-people to
break with him: "You shall know my breach of promise, both the causes of
it, that it is procured by your sin" (for God never leaves any till they
first leave him), "and the consequences of it, that it will produce your
ruin; you are quite undone when you are thrown out of covenant." (4.)
That a new generation might in this time be raised up, which could not
be done all of a sudden. And the children, being brought up under the
tokens of God's displeasure against their fathers, and so bearing their
whoredoms (that is, the punishment of their sins, especially their
idolatry about the golden calf, which God now remembered against them),
might take warning not to tread in the steps of their fathers'
disobedience. And their wandering so long in the wilderness would make
Canaan at last the more welcome to them. It should seem that upon
occasion of this sentence Moses penned the ninetieth Psalm, which is
very apposite to the present state of Israel, and wherein they are
taught to pray that since this sentence could not be reversed it might
be sanctified, and they might learn to apply their hearts unto wisdom.

V. The mercy that was mixed with this severe sentence.

1\. Mercy to Caleb and Joshua, that though they should wander with the
rest in the wilderness, yet they, and only they of all that were now
above twenty years old, should survive the years of banishment, and live
to enter Canaan. Caleb only is spoken of ([Num
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#024).md), and a particular mark of
honour put upon him, both, (1.) In the character given of him: he had
another spirit, different from the rest of the spies, an after-spirit,
which furnished him with second thoughts, and he followed the Lord
fully, kept close to his duty, and went through with it, though deserted
and threatened; and, (2.) In the recompence promised to him: Him will I
bring in due time into the land whereinto he went. Note, \[1.\] It ought
to be the great care and endeavour of every one of us to follow the Lord
fully. We must, in a course of obedience to God's will and of service to
his honour, follow him universally, without dividing, - uprightly,
without dissembling, - cheerfully, without disputing, - and constantly,
without declining; and this is following him fully. \[2.\] Those that
would follow God fully must have another spirit, another from the spirit
of the world, and another from what their own spirit has been. They must
have the spirit of Caleb. \[3.\] Those that follow God fully in times of
general apostasy God will own and honour by singular preservations in
times of general calamity. The heavenly Canaan shall be the everlasting
inheritance of those that follow the Lord fully. When Caleb is again
mentioned ([Num 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#030).md) Joshua stands
with him, compassed with the same favours and crowned with the same
honours, having stood with him in the same services.

2\. Mercy to the children even of these rebels. They should have a seed
preserved, and Canaan secured to that seed: Your little ones, now under
twenty years old, which you, in your unbelief, said should be a prey,
them will I bring in, [Num 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#031.md). They
had invidiously charged God with a design to ruin their children, [Num
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#003.md). But God will let them know that
he can put a difference between the guilty and the innocent, and cut
them off without touching their children. Thus the promise made to
Abraham, though it seemed to fail for a time, was kept from failing for
evermore; and, though God chastened their transgressions with a rod, yet
his loving kindness he would not utterly take away.

[Numbers 14:36](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">num 14:36</span></span>

Here is, I. The sudden death of the ten evil spies. While the sentence
was passing upon the people, before it was published, they died of the
plague before the Lord, [Num 14:36](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#036.md),
[Num 14:37](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#037.md). Now,

1\. God hereby showed his particular displeasure against those who
sinned and made Israel to sin. (1.) They sinned themselves, in bringing
up a slander upon the land of promise. Note, Those greatly provoke God
who misrepresent religion, cast reproach upon it, and raise prejudices
in men's minds against it, or give occasion to those to do so who seek
occasion. Those that represent the service of God as mean and
despicable, melancholy and uncomfortable, hard and impracticable,
needless and unprofitable, bring up an evil report upon the good land,
pervert the right ways of the Lord, and in effect give him the lie. (2.)
They made Israel to sin. They designedly made all the congregation
murmur against God. Note, Ring-leaders in sin may expect to fall under
particular marks of the wrath of God, who will severely reckon for the
blood of souls, which is thus spilt.

2\. God hereby showed what he could have done with the whole
congregation, and gave an earnest of the execution of the sentence now
passed upon them. He that thus cut off one of a tribe could have cut off
their whole tribes suddenly, and would do it gradually. Note, The
remarkable deaths of notorious sinners are earnests of the final
perdition of ungodly men, [Pe2 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005.md),
[Pe2 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#006.md). Thus the wrath of God is
revealed, that sinners may hear and fear.

II\. The special preservation of Caleb and Joshua: They lived still,
[Num 14:38](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#038.md). It is probable that all
the twelve spies stood together, for the eyes of all Israel were now
upon them; and therefore it is taken notice of as very remarkable, and
which could not but be affecting to the whole congregation, that when
the ten evil spies fell down dead of the plague, a malignant infectious
distemper, yet these two that stood among them lived, and were well. God
hereby confirmed their testimony, and put those to confusion that spoke
of stoning them. He likewise gave them an assurance of their continued
preservation in the wilderness, when thousands should fall on their
right hand and on their left, [Psa
91:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#007.md). Death never misses his mark, nor
takes any by oversight that were designed for life, though in the midst
of those that were to die.

III\. The publication of the sentence to all the people, [Num
14:36](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#036.md). He told them all what the
decree was which had gone forth concerning them, and which could not be
reversed, that they must all die in the wilderness, and Canaan must be
reserved for the next generation. It was a very great disappointment, we
may well think, to Moses himself, who longed to be in Canaan, as well as
to all the people; yet he acquiesced, but they wept and mourned greatly.
The assurance which Moses had of God's being glorified by this sentence
gave him satisfaction, while the consciousness of their own guilt, and
their having procured it to themselves, gave them the greatest vexation.
They wept for nothing ([Num 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#001).md), and
now they have cause given them to weep; so justly are murmurers made
mourners. If they had mourned for the sin when they were faithfully
reproved for it ([Num 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#009).md), the
sentence would have been prevented; but now that they mourned for the
judgment only their grief came too late, and did them no service; they
found no place for repentance, though they sought it carefully with
tears, [Heb 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#017.md). Such mourning as
this there is in hell, but the tears will not quench the flames, no, nor
cool the tongue.

IV\. The foolish fruitless attempts of some of the Israelites to enter
Canaan, notwithstanding the sentence.

1\. They were now eager to go forward towards Canaan, [Num
14:40](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#040.md). They were up early, mustered
all their force, got together in a body, and begged of Moses to lead
them on against the enemy, and now there is no more talk among them of
making a captain to return into Egypt. They confess their fault: We have
sinned; they profess reformation: Lo, we be here, and will go up. They
now desire the land which they had despised, and put a confidence in the
promise which they had distrusted. Thus when God judges he will
overcome, and, first or last, will convince sinners of the evil of all
their ungodly deeds, and hard speeches, and force them to recall their
own words. But, though God was glorified by this recantation of theirs,
they were not benefited by it, because it came too late. The decree had
gone forth, the consumption was determined; they did not seek the Lord
while he might be found, and now he would not be found. O, if men would
but be as earnest for heaven while their day of grace lasts as they will
be when it is over, would be as solicitous to provide themselves with
oil while the bridegroom tarries as they will be when the bridegroom
comes, how well were it for them!

2\. Moses utterly disallows their motion, and forbids the expedition
they were meditating: Go not up, [Num
14:41-43](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#041). (1..md) He gives them warning
of the sin; it is transgressing the commandment of the Lord, who had
expressly ordered them, when they did move, to move back towards the Red
Sea. Note, That which has been duty, in its season, when it comes to be
mistimed may be turned into sin. It is true the command he refers to was
in the nature of a punishment, but he that has not obeyed the law is
obliged to submit to the penalty, for the Lord is our Judge as well as
Lawgiver. (2.) He gives them this warning of the danger: "It shall not
prosper, never expect it." Note, It is folly to promise ourselves
success in that which we undertake contrary to the mind of God. "The
Canaanites are before you to attack you, and the Lord is not among you
to protect you and fight for you, and therefore look to yourselves that
you be not smitten before your enemies." Those that are out of the way
of their duty are from under God's protection, and go at their peril. It
is dangerous going where we cannot expect God should go along with us.
Nay, he plainly foresees and foretels their defeat: You shall fall by
the sword of the Amalekites and Canaanites (who were to have fallen by
their sword); Because you are turned away from the Lord, from following
the guidance of his precept and promise, therefore the Lord will not be
with you. Note, God will certainly leave those that leave him; and those
that are left of him lie exposed to all misery.

3\. They venture notwithstanding. Never was people so perverse and so
desperately resolved in every thing to walk contrary to God. God bade
them go, and they would not; he forbade them, and they would. Thus is
the carnal mind enmity to God: They presumed to go up unto the hill-top,
[Num 14:44](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#044). Here, (1..md) They struggled
against the sentence of divine justice, and would press on in defiance
of it. (2.) They slighted the tokens of God's presence, for they would
go though they left Moses and the ark of the covenant behind them. They
had distrusted God's strength, and now they presume upon their own
without his.

4\. The expedition speeds accordingly, [Num
14:45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#045.md). The enemy had posted themselves
upon the top of the hill, to make good that pass against the invaders,
and, being informed by their scouts of their approach, sallied out upon
them, and defeated them, and it is probable that many of the Israelites
were killed. Now the sentence began to be executed that their carcases
should fall in the wilderness. Note, That affair can never end well that
begins with sin. The way to obtain peace with our friends, and success
against our enemies, is to make God our friend, and keep ourselves in
his love. The Jews, like these their ancestors, when they had rejected
Christ's righteousness, attempted to establish their own, and it sped as
this.
