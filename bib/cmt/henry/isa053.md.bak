### [Isaiah Chapter 53](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 53:0</span></span>

The two great things which the Spirit of Christ in the Old Testament
prophets testified beforehand were the sufferings of Christ and the
glory that should follow, [Pe1 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011.md).
And that which Christ himself, when he expounded Moses and all the
prophets, showed to be the drift and scope of them all was that Christ
ought to suffer and then to enter into his glory, [Luk
24:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026.md), [Luk
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#027.md). But nowhere in all the Old
Testament are these two so plainly and fully prophesied of as here in
this chapter, out of which divers passages are quoted with application
to Christ in the New Testament. This chapter is so replenished with the
unsearchable riches of Christ that it may be called rather the gospel of
the evangelist Isaiah than the prophecy of the prophet Isaiah. We may
observe here, I. The reproach of Christ's sufferings - the meanness of
his appearance, the greatness of his grief, and the prejudices which
many conceived in consequences against his doctrine ([Isa
53:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001).md). II. The rolling away of this
reproach, and the stamping of immortal honour upon his sufferings,
notwithstanding the disgrace and ignominy of them, by four
considerations: - 1. That therein he did his Father's will ([Isa
53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004.md), [Isa
53:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006.md), [Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010).md). 2. That thereby he made
atonement for the sin of man ([Isa
53:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004.md), [Isa
53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md), [Isa
53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011.md), [Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012).md), for it was not for any sin of
his own that he suffered ([Isa 53:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009).md).
3. That he bore his sufferings with an invincible and exemplary patience
([Isa 53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007).md). 4. That he should prosper
in his undertaking, and his sufferings should end in his immortal honour
([Isa 53:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010).md). By mixing faith with
the prophecy of this chapter we may improve our acquaintance with Jesus
Christ and him crucified, with Jesus Christ and him glorified, dying for
our sins and rising again for our justification.

[Isaiah 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 53:1</span></span>

The prophet, in the close of the former chapter, had foreseen and
foretold the kind reception which the gospel of Christ should find among
the Gentiles, that nations and their kings should bid it welcome, that
those who had not seen him should believe in him; and though they had
not any prophecies among them of gospel grace, which might raise their
expectations, and dispose them to entertain it, yet upon the first
notice of it they should give it its due weight and consideration. Now
here he foretels, with wonder, the unbelief of the Jews, notwithstanding
the previous notices they had of the coming of the Messiah in the Old
Testament and the opportunity they had of being personally acquainted
with him. Observe here,

I. The contempt they put upon the gospel of Christ, [Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md). The unbelief of the Jews in our
Saviour's time is expressly said to be the fulfilling of this word, [Joh
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#038.md). And it is applied likewise to
the little success which the apostles' preaching met with among Jews and
Gentiles, [Rom 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#016.md). Note, 1. Of the
many that hear the report of the gospel there are few, very few, that
believe it. It is reported openly and publicly, not whispered in a
corner, or confined to the schools, but proclaimed to all; and it is so
faithful a saying, and so well worthy of all acceptation, that one would
think it should be universally received and believed. But it is quite
otherwise; few believed the prophets who spoke before of Christ; when he
came himself none of the rulers nor of the Pharisees followed him, and
but here and there one of the common people; and, when the apostles
carried this report all the world over, some in every place believed,
but comparatively very few. To this day, of the many that profess to
believe this report, there are few that cordially embrace it and submit
to the power of it. 2. Therefore people believe not the report of the
gospel, because the arm of the Lord is not revealed to them; they do not
discern, nor will be brought to acknowledge, that divine power which
goes along with the word. The arm of the Lord is made bare (as was said,
[Isa 52:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#010).md) in the miracles that were
wrought to confirm Christ's doctrine, in the wonderful success of it,
and its energy upon the conscience; though it is a still voice, it is a
strong one; but they do not perceive this, nor do they experience in
themselves that working of the Spirit which makes the word effectual.
They believe not the gospel because, by rebelling against the light they
had, they had forfeited the grace of God, which therefore he justly
denied them and withheld from them, and for want of that they believed
not. 3. This is a thing we ought to be much affected with; it is to be
wondered at, and greatly lamented, and ministers may go to God and
complain of it to him, as the prophet here. What a pity is it that such
rich grace should be received in vain, that precious souls should perish
at the pool's side, because they will not step in and be healed!

II\. The contempt they put upon the person of Christ because of the
meanness of his appearance, [Isa 53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002.md),
[Isa 53:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#003.md). This seems to come in as a
reason why they rejected his doctrine, because they were prejudiced
against his person. When he was on earth many that heard him preach, and
could not but approve of what they heard, would not give it any regard
or entertainment, because it came from one that made so small a figure
and had no external advantages to recommend him. Observe here,

1\. The low condition he submitted to, and how he abased and emptied
himself. The entry he made into the world, and the character he wore in
it, were no way agreeable to the ideas which the Jews had formed of the
Messiah and their expectations concerning him, but quite the reverse.
(1.) It was expected that his extraction would be very great and noble.
He was to be the Son of David, of a family that had a name like to the
names of the great men that were in the earth, [Sa2
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#009.md). But he sprang out of this royal
and illustrious family when it was reduced and sunk, and Joseph, that
son of David, who was his supposed father, was but a poor carpenter,
perhaps a ship-carpenter, for most of his relations were fishermen. This
is here meant by his being a root out of a dry ground, his being born of
a mean and despicable family, in the north, in Galilee, of a family out
of which, like a dry and desert ground, nothing green, nothing great,
was expected, in a country of such small repute that it was thought no
good thing could come out of it. His mother, being a virgin, was as dry
ground, yet from her he sprang who is not only fruit, but root. The seed
on the stony ground had no root; but, though Christ grew out of a dry
ground, he is both the root and the offspring of David, the root of the
good olive. (2.) It was expected that he should make a public entry, and
come in pomp and with observation; but, instead of that, he grew up
before God, not before men. God had his eye upon him, but men regarded
him not: He grew up as a tender plant, silently and insensibly, and
without any noise, as the corn, that tender plant, grows up, we know not
how, [Mar 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#027.md). Christ rose as a
tender plant, which, one would have thought, might easily be crushed, or
might be nipped in one frosty night. The gospel of Christ, in its
beginning, was as a grain of mustard-seed, so inconsiderable did it
seem, [Mat 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#031.md), [Mat
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#032). (3..md) It was expected that he
should have some uncommon beauty in his face and person, which should
charm the eye, attract the heart, and raise the expectations of all that
saw him. But there was nothing of this kind in him; not that he was in
the least deformed or misshapen, but he had no form nor comeliness,
nothing extraordinary, which one might have thought to meet with in the
countenance of an incarnate deity. Those who saw him could not see that
there was any beauty in him that they should desire him, nothing in him
more than in another beloved, [Sol
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#009.md). Moses, when he was born, was
exceedingly fair, to such a degree that it was looked upon as a happy
presage, [Act 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#020.md); [Heb
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#023.md). David, when he was anointed,
was of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to, [Sa1
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#012.md). But our Lord Jesus had nothing
of that to recommend him. Or it may refer not so much to his person as
to the manner of his appearing in the world, which had nothing in it of
sensible glory. His gospel is preached, not with the enticing words of
man's wisdom, but with all plainness, agreeable to the subject. (4.) It
was expected that he should live a pleasant life, and have a full
enjoyment of all the delights of the sons and daughters of men, which
would have invited all sorts to him; but, on the contrary, he was a man
of sorrows and acquainted with grief. It was not only his last scene
that was tragical, but his whole life was so, not only mean, but
miserable,

\- but one continued chain

Of labour, sorrow, and consuming pain.

\- Sir R. Blackmore

Thus, being made sin for us, he underwent the sentence sin had subjected
us to, that we should eat in sorrow all the days of our life ([Gen
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#017).md), and thereby relaxed much of the
rigour and extremity of the sentence as to us. His condition was, upon
many accounts, sorrowful. He was unsettled, had not where to lay his
head, lived upon alms, was opposed and menaced, and endured the
contradiction of sinners against himself. His spirit was tender, and he
admitted the impressions of sorrow. We never read that he laughed, but
often that he wept. Lentulus, in his epistle to the Roman senate
concerning Jesus, says, "he was never seen to laugh;" and so worn and
macerated was he with continual grief that when he was but a little
above thirty years of age he was taken to be nearly fifty, [Joh
8:57](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#057.md). Grief was his intimate
acquaintance; for he acquainted himself with the grievances of others,
and sympathized with them, and he never set his own at a distance; for
in his transfiguration he talked of his own decease, and in his triumph
he wept over Jerusalem. Let us look unto him and mourn.

2\. The low opinion that men had of him, upon this account. Being
generally apt to judge of persons and things by the sight of the eye,
and according to outward appearance, they saw no beauty in him that they
should desire him. There was a great deal of true beauty in him, the
beauty of holiness and the beauty of goodness, enough to render him the
desire of all nations; but the far greater part of those among whom he
lived, and conversed, saw none of this beauty, for it was spiritually
discerned. Carnal hearts see no excellency in the Lord Jesus, nothing
that should induce them to desire an acquaintance with him or interest
in him. Nay, he is not only not desired, but he is despised and
rejected, abandoned and abhorred, a reproach of men, an abject, one that
men were shy of keeping company with and had not any esteem for, a worm
and no man. He was despised as a mean man, rejected as a bad man. He was
the stone which the builders refused; they would not have him to reign
over them. Men, who should have had so much reason as to understand
things better, so much tenderness as not to trample upon a man in misery
- men whom he came to seek and save rejected him: "We hid as it were our
faces from him, looked another way, and his sufferings were as nothing
to us; though never sorrow was like unto his sorrow. Nay, we not only
behaved as having no concern for him, but as loathing him, and having
him in detestation." It may be read, He hid as it were his face from us,
concealed the glory of his majesty, and drew a veil over it, and
therefore he was despised and we esteemed him not, because we could not
see through that veil. Christ having undertaken to make satisfaction to
the justice of God for the injury man had done him in his honour by sin
(and God cannot be injured except in his honour), he did it not only by
divesting himself of the glories due to an incarnate deity, but by
submitting himself to the disgraces due to the worst of men and
malefactors; and thus by vilifying himself he glorified his Father: but
this is a good reason why we should esteem him highly, and study to do
him honour; let him be received by us whom men rejected.

[Isaiah 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 53:4</span></span>

In these verses we have,

I. A further account of the sufferings of Christ. Much was said before,
but more is said here, of the very low condition to which he abased and
humbled himself, to which he became obedient even to the death of the
cross. 1. He had griefs and sorrows; being acquainted with them, he kept
up the acquaintance, and did not grow shy, no, not of such melancholy
acquaintance. Were griefs and sorrows allotted him? He bore them, and
blamed not his lot; he carried them, and did neither shrink from them,
nor sink under them. The load was heavy and the way long, and yet he did
not tire, but persevered to the end, till he said, It is finished. 2. He
had blows and bruises; he was stricken, smitten, and afflicted. His
sorrows bruised him; he felt pain and smart from them; they touched him
in the most tender part, especially when God was dishonoured, and when
he forsook him upon the cross. All along he was smitten with the tongue,
when he was cavilled at and contradicted, put under the worst of
characters, and had all manner of evil said against him. At last he was
smitten with the hand, with blow after blow. 3. He had wounds and
stripes. He was scourged, not under the merciful restriction of the
Jewish law, which allowed not above forty stripes to be given to the
worst of male factors, but according to the usage of the Romans. And his
scourging, doubtless, was the more severe because Pilate intended it as
an equivalent for his crucifixion, and yet it proved a preface to it. He
was wounded in his hands, and feet, and side. Though it was so ordered
that not a bone of him should be broken, yet he had scarcely in any part
a whole skin (how fond soever we are to sleep in one, even when we are
called out to suffer for him), but from the crown of his head, which was
crowned with thorns, to the soles of his feet, which were nailed to the
cross, nothing appeared but wounds and bruises. 4. He was wronged and
abused ([Isa 53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007).md): He was oppressed,
injuriously treated and hardly dealt with. That was laid to his charge
which he was perfectly innocent of, that laid upon him which he did not
deserve, and in both he was oppressed and injured. He was afflicted both
in mind and body; being oppressed, he laid it to heart, and, though, he
was patient, was not stupid under it, but mingled his tears with those
of the oppressed, that have no comforter, because on the side of the
oppressors there is power, [Ecc 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md).
Oppression is a sore affliction; it has made many a wise man mad ([Ecc
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007).md); but our Lord Jesus, though, when
he was oppressed, he was afflicted, kept possession of his own soul. 5.
he was judged and imprisoned, as is implied in his being taken from
prison and judgment, [Isa 53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md). God
having made him sin for us, he was proceeded against as a malefactor; he
was apprehended and taken into custody, and made a prisoner; he was
judge, accused, tried, and condemned, according to the usual forms of
law: God filed a process against him, judged him in pursuance of that
process, and confined him in the prison of the grave, at the door of
which a stone was rolled and sealed. 6. He was cut off by an untimely
death from the land of the living, though he lived a most useful life,
did so many good works, and they were all such that one would be apt to
think it was for some of them that they stoned him. He was stricken to
death, to the grave which he made with the wicked (for he was crucified
between two thieves, as if he had been the worst of the three) and yet
with the rich, for he was buried in a sepulchre that belonged to Joseph,
an honourable counsellor. Though he died with the wicked, and according
to the common course of dealing with criminals should have been buried
with them in the place where he was crucified, yet God here foretold,
and Providence so ordered it, that he should make his grave with the
innocent, with the rich, as a mark of distinction put between him and
those that really deserved to die, even in his sufferings.

II\. A full account of the meaning of his sufferings. It was a very
great mystery that so excellent a person should suffer such hard things;
and it is natural to ask with amazement, "How came it about? What evil
had he done?" His enemies indeed looked upon him as suffering justly for
his crimes; and, though they could lay nothing to his charge, they
esteemed him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted, [Isa
53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004.md). Because they hated him, and
persecuted him, they thought that God did, that he was his enemy and
fought against him; and therefore they were the more enraged against
him, saying, God has forsaken him; persecute and take him, [Psa
71:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#011.md). Those that are justly smitten
are smitten of God, for by him princes decree justice; and so they
looked upon him to be smitten, justly put to death as a blasphemer, a
deceiver, and an enemy to Caesar. Those that saw him hanging on the
cross enquired not into the merits of his cause, but took it for granted
that he was guilty of every thing laid to his charge and that therefore
vengeance suffered him not to live. Thus Job's friends esteemed him
smitten of God, because there was something uncommon in his sufferings.
It is true he was smitten of God, [Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md) (or, as some read it, he was
God's smitten and afflicted, the Son of God, though smitten and
afflicted), but not in the sense in which they meant it; for, though he
suffered all these things,

1\. He never did any thing in the least to deserve this hard usage.
Whereas he was charged with perverting the nation, and sowing sedition,
it was utterly false; he had done no violence, but went about doing
good. And, whereas he was called that deceiver, he never deserved that
character; for there was no deceit in his mouth ([Isa
53:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009).md), to which the apostle refers,
[Pe1 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#022.md). He did no sin, neither was
guile found in his mouth. He never offended either in word or deed, nor
could any of his enemies take up that challenge of his, Which of you
convinceth me of sin? The judge that condemned owned he found no fault
in him, and the centurion that executed him professed that certainly he
was a righteous man.

2\. He conducted himself under his sufferings so as to make it appear
that he did not suffer as an evil-doer; for, though he was oppressed and
afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth ([Isa
53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007).md), no, not so much as to plead his
own innocency, but freely offered himself to suffer and die for us, and
objected nothing against it. This takes away the scandal of the cross,
that he voluntarily submitted to it, for great and holy ends. By his
wisdom he could have evaded the sentence, and by his power have resisted
the execution; but thus it was written, and thus it behoved him to
suffer. This commandment he received from his Father, and therefore he
was led as a lamb to the slaughter, without any difficulty or reluctance
(he is the Lamb of God); and as a sheep is dumb before the shearers,
nay, before the butchers, so he opened not his mouth, which denotes not
only his exemplary patience under affliction ([Psa
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#009).md), and his meekness under reproach
([Psa 38:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#013).md), but his cheerful
compliance with his Father's will. Not my will, but thine be done. Lo, I
come. By this will we are sanctified, his making his own soul, his own
life, an offering for our sin.

3\. It was for our good, and in our stead, that Jesus Christ suffered.
This is asserted here plainly and fully, and in a very great variety of
emphatical expressions.

(1.) It is certain that we are all guilty before God. We have all
sinned, and have come short of the glory of God ([Isa
53:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006).md): All we like sheep have gone
astray, one as well as another. The whole race of mankind lies under the
stain of original corruption, and every particular person stands charged
with many actual transgressions. We have all gone astray from God our
rightful owner, alienated ourselves from him, from the ends he designed
us to move towards and the way he appointed us to move in. We have gone
astray like sheep, which are apt to wander, and are unapt, when they
have gone astray, to find the way home again. That is our true
character; we are bent to backslide from God, but altogether unable of
ourselves to return to him. This is mentioned not only as our infelicity
(that we go astray from the green pastures and expose ourselves to the
beasts of prey), but as our iniquity. We affront God in going astray
from him, for we turn aside every one to his own way, and thereby set up
ourselves, and our own will, in competition with God and his will, which
is the malignity of sin. Instead of walking obediently in God's way, we
have turned wilfully and stubbornly to our own way, the way of our own
heart, the way that our own corrupt appetites and passions lead us to.
We have set up for ourselves, to be our own masters, our own carvers, to
do what we will and have what we will. Some think it intimates our own
evil way, in distinction from the evil way of others. Sinners have their
own iniquity, their beloved sin, which does most easily beset them,
their own evil way, that they are particularly fond of and bless
themselves in.

(2.) Our sins are our sorrows and our griefs ([Isa
53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004).md), or, as it may be read, our
sicknesses and our wounds: the Septuagint reads it, our sins; and so the
apostle, [Pe1 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024.md). Our original
corruptions are the sickness and disease of the soul, an habitual
indisposition; our actual transgressions are the wounds of the soul,
which put conscience to pain, if it be not seared and senseless. Or our
sins are called our griefs and sorrows because all our griefs and
sorrows are owing to our sins and our sins deserve all our griefs and
sorrows, even those that are most extreme and everlasting.

(3.) Our Lord Jesus was appointed and did undertake to make satisfaction
for our sins and so to save us from the penal consequences of them.
\[1.\] He was appointed to do it, by the will of his Father; for the
Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all. God chose him to be the
Saviour of poor sinners and would have him to save them in this way, by
bearing their sins and the punishment of them; not the idem - the same
that we should have suffered, but the tantundem - that which was more
than equivalent for the maintaining of the honour of the holiness and
justice of God in the government of the world. Observe here, First, In
what way we are saved from the ruin to which by sin we had become liable
- by laying our sins on Christ, as the sins of the offerer were laid
upon the sacrifice and those of all Israel upon the head of the
scape-goat. Our sins were made to meet upon him (so the margin reads
it); the sins of all that he was to save, from every place and every
age, met upon him, and he was met with for them. They were made to fall
upon him (so some read it) as those rushed upon him that came with
swords and staves to take him. The laying of our sins upon Christ
implies the taking of them off from us; we shall not fall under the
curse of the law if we submit to the grace of the gospel. They were laid
upon Christ when he was made sin (that is, a sin-offering) for us, and
redeemed us from the curse of the law by being made a curse for us; thus
he put himself into a capacity to make those easy that come to him
heavily laden under the burden of sin. See [Psa
40:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md). Secondly, By whom this was
appointed. It was the Lord that laid our iniquities on Christ; he
contrived this way of reconciliation and salvation, and he accepted of
the vicarious satisfaction Christ was to make. Christ was delivered to
death by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God. None but God
had power to lay our sins upon Christ, both because the sin was
committed against him and to him the satisfaction was to be made, and
because Christ, on whom the iniquity was to be laid, was his own Son,
the Son of his love, and his holy child Jesus, who himself knew no sin.
Thirdly, For whom this atonement was to be made. It was the iniquity of
us all that was laid on Christ; for in Christ there is a sufficiency of
merit for the salvation of all, and a serious offer made of that
salvation to all, which excludes none that do not exclude themselves. It
intimates that this is the one only way of salvation. All that are
justified are justified by having their sins laid on Jesus Christ, and,
though they were ever so many, he is able to bear the weight of them
all. \[2.\] He undertook to do it. God laid upon him our iniquity; but
did he consent to it? Yes, he did; for some think that the true reading
of the next words ([Isa 53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007).md) is, It
was exacted, and he answered; divine justice demanded satisfaction for
our sins, and he engaged to make the satisfaction. He became our surety,
not as originally bound with us, but as bail to the action: "Upon me be
the curse, my Father." And therefore, when he was seized, he stipulated
with those into whose hands he surrendered himself that that should be
his disciples' discharge: If you seek me, let these go their way, [Joh
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#008.md). By his own voluntary undertaking
he made himself responsible for our debt, and it is well for us that he
was responsible. Thus he restored that which he took not away.

(4.) Having undertaken our debt, he underwent the penalty. Solomon says:
He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it. Christ, being
surety for us, did smart for it. \[1.\] He bore our griefs and carried
our sorrows, [Isa 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004.md). He not only
submitted to the common infirmities of human nature, and the common
calamities of human life, which sin had introduced, but he underwent the
extremities of grief, when he said, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful. He
made the sorrows of this present time heavy to himself, that he might
make them light and easy for us. Sin is the wormwood and the fall in the
affliction and the misery. Christ bore our sins, and so bore our griefs,
bore them off us, that we should never be pressed above measure. This is
quoted ([Mat 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#017).md) with application to
the compassion Christ had for the sick that came to him to be cured and
the power he put forth to cure them. \[2.\] He did this by suffering for
our sins ([Isa 53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005).md): He was wounded
for our transgressions, to make atonement for them and to purchase for
us the pardon of them. Our sins were the thorns in his head, the nails
in his hands and feet, the spear in his side. Wounds and bruises were
the consequences of sin, what we deserved and what we had brought upon
ourselves, [Isa 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006.md). That these wounds
and bruises, though they are painful, may not be mortal, Christ was
wounded for our transgressions, was tormented or pained (the word is
used for the pains of a woman in travail) for our revolts and
rebellions. He was bruised, or crushed, for our iniquities; they were
the procuring cause of his death. To the same purport is [Isa
53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md), for the transgression of my
people was he smitten, the stroke was upon him that should have been
upon us; and so some read it, He was cut off for the iniquity of my
people, unto whom the stroke belonged, or was due. He was delivered to
death for our offences, [Rom 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025.md).
Hence it is said to be according to the scriptures, according to this
scripture, that Christ died for our sins, [Co1
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#003.md). Some read this, by the
transgressions of my people; that is, by the wicked hands of the Jews,
who were, in profession, God's people, he was stricken, was crucified
and slain, [Act 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#023.md). But, doubtless,
we are to take it in the former sense, which is abundantly confirmed by
the angel's prediction of the Messiah's undertaking, solemnly delivered
to Daniel, that he shall finish transgression, make an end of sin, and
make reconciliation for iniquity, [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md).

(5.) The consequence of this to us is our peace and healing, [Isa
53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005.md). \[1.\] Hereby we have peace: The
chastisement of our peace was upon him; he, by submitting to these
chastisements, slew the enmity, and settled an amity, between God and
man; he made peace by the blood of his cross. Whereas by sin we had
become odious to God's holiness and obnoxious to his justice, through
Christ God is reconciled to us, and not only forgives our sins and saves
us from ruin, but takes us into friendship and fellowship with himself,
and thereby peace (that is, all good) comes unto us, [Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020.md). He is our peace, [Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014.md). Christ was in pain that we might
be at ease; he gave satisfaction to the justice of God that we might
have satisfaction in our own minds, might be of good cheer, knowing that
through him our sins are forgiven us. \[2.\] Hereby we have healing; for
by his stripes we are healed. Sin is not only a crime, for which we were
condemned to die and which Christ purchased for us the pardon of, but it
is a disease, which tends directly to the death of our souls and which
Christ provided for the cure of. By his stripes (that is, the sufferings
he underwent) he purchased for us the Spirit and grace of God to mortify
our corruptions, which are the distempers of our souls, and to put our
souls in a good state of health, that they may be fit to serve God and
prepared to enjoy him. And by the doctrine of Christ's cross, and the
powerful arguments it furnishes us with against sin, the dominion of sin
is broken in us and we are fortified against that which feeds the
disease.

(6.) The consequence of this to Christ was his resurrection and
advancement to perpetual honour. This makes the offence of the cross
perfectly to cease; he yielded himself to die as a sacrifice, as a lamb,
and, to make it evident that the sacrifice he offered of himself was
accepted, we are told here, [Isa 53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md),
\[1.\] That he was discharged: He was taken from prison and from
judgment; whereas he was imprisoned in the grave under a judicial
process, lay there under an arrest for our debt, and judgment seemed to
be given against him, he was by an express order from heaven taken out
of the prison of the grave, an angel was sent on purpose to roll away
the stone and set him at liberty, by which the judgment given against
him was reversed and taken off; this redounds not only to his honour,
but to our comfort; for, being delivered for our offences, he was raised
again for our justification. That discharge of the bail amounted to a
release of the debt. \[2.\] That he was preferred: Who shall declare his
generation? his age, or continuance (so the word signifies), the time of
his life? He rose to die no more; death had no more dominion over him.
He that was dead is alive, and lives for evermore; and who can describe
that immortality to which he rose, or number the years and ages of it?
And he is advanced to this eternal life because for the transgression of
his people he became obedient to death. We may take it as denoting the
time of his usefulness, as David is said to serve his generation, and so
to answer the end of living. Who can declare how great a blessing Christ
by his death and resurrection will be to the world? Some by his
generation understand his spiritual seed: Who can count the vast numbers
of converts that shall by the gospel be begotten to him, like the dew of
the morning?

When thus exalted he shall live to see

A numberless believing progeny

Of his adopted sons; the godlike race

Exceed the stars that heav'n's high arches grace.

\- Sir R. Blackmore

Of this generation of his let us pray, as Moses did for Israel, The Lord
God of our fathers make them a thousand times so many more as they are,
and bless them as he has promised them, [Deu
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#011.md).

[Isaiah 53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 53:10</span></span>

In the foregoing verses the prophet had testified very particularly of
the sufferings of Christ, yet mixing some hints of the happy issue of
them; here he again mentions his sufferings, but largely foretels the
glory that should follow. We may observe, in these verses,

I. The services and sufferings of Christ's state of humiliation. Come,
and see how he loved us, see what he did for us.

1\. He submitted to the frowns of Heaven ([Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010).md): Yet it pleased the Lord to
bruise him, to put him to pain, or torment, or grief. The scripture
nowhere says that Christ is his sufferings underwent the wrath of God;
but it says here, (1.) That the Lord bruised him, not only permitted men
to bruise him, but awakened his own sword against him, [Zac
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007.md). They esteemed him smitten of God
for some very great sin of his own ([Isa
53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004).md); now it was true that he was
smitten of God, but it was for our sin; the Lord bruised him, for he did
not spare him, but delivered him up for us all, [Rom
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032.md). He it was that put the bitter
cup into his hand, and obliged him to drink it ([Joh
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#011).md), having laid upon him our
iniquity. He it was that made him sin and a curse for us, and turned to
ashes all his burnt-offering, in token of the acceptance of it, [Psa
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#003). (2..md) That he bruised him so as
to put him to grief. Christ accommodated himself to this dispensation,
and received the impressions of grief from his Father's delivering him
up; and he was troubled to such a degree that it put him into an agony,
and he began to be amazed and very heavy. (3.) It pleased the Lord to do
this. He determined to do it; it was the result of an eternal counsel;
and he delighted in it, as it was an effectual method for the salvation
of man and the securing and advancing of the honour of God.

2\. He substituted himself in the room of sinners, as a sacrifice. He
made his soul an offering for sin; he himself explains this ([Mat
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028).md), that he came to give his life
a ransom for many. When men brought bulls and goats as sacrifices for
sin they made them offerings, for they had an interest in them, God
having put them under the feet of man. But Christ made himself an
offering; it was his own act and deed. We could not put him in our
stead, but he put himself, and said, Father, into thy hands I commit my
spirit, in a higher sense than David said, or could say it. "Father, I
commit my soul to thee, I deposit it in thy hands, as the life of a
sacrifice and the price of pardons." Thus he shall bear the iniquities
of the many that he designed to justify ([Isa
53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011).md), shall take away the sin of the
world by taking it upon himself, [Joh
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029.md). This mentioned again ([Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012).md): He bore the sin of many, who,
if they had borne it themselves, would have been sunk by it to the
lowest hell. See how this dwelt upon; for, whenever we think of the
sufferings of Christ, we must see him in them bearing our sin.

3\. He subjected himself to that which to us is the wages of sin ([Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012).md): He has poured out his soul
unto death, poured it out as water, so little account did he make of it,
when the laying of it down was the appointed means of our redemption and
salvation. He loved not his life unto the death, and his followers, the
martyrs, did likewise, [Rev 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#011.md). Or,
rather, he poured it out as a drink-offering, to make his sacrifice
complete, poured it out as wine, that his blood might be drink indeed,
as his flesh is meat indeed to all believers. There was not only a
colliquation of his body in his sufferings ([Psa
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014), I am poured out like water.md),
but a surrender of his spirit; he poured out that, even unto death,
though he is the Lord of life.

4\. He suffered himself to be ranked with sinners, and yet offered
himself to be an intercessor for sinners, [Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012). (1..md) It was a great aggravation
of his sufferings that he was numbered with transgressors, that he was
not only condemned as a malefactor, but executed in company with two
notorious malefactors, and he in the midst, as if he had been the worst
of the three, in which circumstance of his suffering, the evangelist
tells us, this prophecy was fulfilled, [Mar
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#027.md), [Mar
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#028.md). Nay, the vilest malefactor of
all, Barabbas, who was a traitor, a thief, and a murderer, was put in
election with him for the favour of the people, and carried it; for they
would not have Jesus released, but Barabbas. In his whole life he was
numbered among the transgressors; for he was called and accounted a
sabbath-breaker, a drunkard, and a friend to publicans and sinners. (2.)
It was a great commendation of his sufferings, and redounded very much
to his honour, that in his sufferings he made intercession for the
transgressors, for those that reviled and crucified him; for he prayed,
Father, forgive them, thereby showing, not only that he forgave them,
but that he was now doing that upon which their forgiveness, and the
forgiveness of all other transgressors, were to be founded. That prayer
was the language of his blood, crying, not for vengeance, but for mercy,
and therein it speaks better things than that of Abel, even for those
who with wicked hands shed it.

II\. The grace and glories of his state of exaltation; and the graces he
confers on us are not the least of the glories conferred on him. These
are secured to him by the covenant of redemption, which these verses
give us some idea of. He promises to make his soul an offering for sin,
consents that the Father shall deliver him up, and undertakes to bear
the sin of many, in consideration of which the Father promises to
glorify him, not only with the glory he had, as God, before the world
was ([Joh 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005).md), but with the glories
of the Mediator.

1\. He shall have the glory of an everlasting Father. Under this title
he was brought into the world ([Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006).md), and he shall not fail to answer
the title when he goes out of the world. This was the promise made to
Abraham (who herein was a type of Christ), that he should be the father
of many nations and so be the heir of the world, [Rom
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#013.md), [Rom
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#017.md). As he was the root of the Jewish
church, and the covenant was made with him and his seed, so is Christ of
the universal church and with him and his spiritual seed is the covenant
of grace made, which is grounded upon and grafted in the covenant of
redemption, which here we have some of the glorious promises of. It is
promised,

(1.) That the Redeemer shall have a seed to serve him and to bear up his
name, [Psa 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#030.md). True believers are
the seed of Christ; the Father gave them to him to be so, [Joh
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#006.md). He died to purchase and purify
them to himself, fell to the ground as a corn of wheat, that he might
bring forth much fruit, [Joh 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024.md).
The word, that incorruptible see, of which they are born again, is his
word; the Spirit, the great author of their regeneration, is his Spirit;
and it is his image that is impressed upon them.

(2.) That he shall live to see his seed. Christ's children have a living
Father, and because he lives they shall live also, for he is their life.
Though he died, he rose again, and left not his children orphans, but
took effectual care to secure to them the spirit, the blessing, and the
inheritance of sons. He shall see a great increase of them; the word is
plural, He shall see his seeds, multitudes of them, so many that they
cannot be numbered.

(3.) That he shall himself continue to take care of the affairs of this
numerous family: He shall prolong his days. Many, when they see their
seed, their seed's seed, wish to depart in peace; but Christ will not
commit the care of his family to any other, no, he shall himself live
long, and of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no
end, for he ever lives. Some refer it to believers: He shall see a seed
that shall prolong its days, agreeing with [Psa
89:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#029.md), [Psa
89:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#036.md), His seed shall endure for ever.
While the world stands Christ will have a church in it, which he himself
will be the life of.

(4.) That his great undertaking shall be successful and shall answer
expectation: The pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. God's
purposes shall take effect, and not one iota or tittle of them shall
fail. Note, \[1.\] The work of man's redemption is in the hands of the
Lord Jesus, and it is in good hands. It is well for us that it is in
his, for our own hands are not sufficient for us, but he is able to save
to the uttermost. It is in his hands who upholds all things. \[2.\] It
is the good pleasure of the Lord, which denotes not only his counsel
concerning it, but his complacency in it; and therefore God loved him,
and was well pleased in him, because he undertook to lay down his life
for the sheep. \[3.\] It has prospered hitherto, and shall prosper,
whatever obstructions or difficulties have been, or may be, in the way
of it. Whatever is undertaken according to God's pleasure shall prosper,
[Isa 46:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#010.md). Cyrus, a type of Christ,
shall perform all God's pleasure ([Isa
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028).md), and therefore, no doubt,
Christ shall. Christ was so perfectly well qualified for his
undertaking, and prosecuted it with so much vigour, and it was from
first to last so well devised, that it could not fail to prosper, to the
honour of his Father and the salvation of all his seed.

(5.) That he shall himself have abundant satisfaction in it ([Isa
53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011).md): He shall see of the travail of
his sous, and shall be satisfied. He shall see it beforehand (so it may
be understood); he shall with the prospect of his sufferings have a
prospect of the fruit, and he shall be satisfied with the bargain. He
shall see it when it is accomplished in the conversion and salvation of
poor sinners. Note, \[1.\] Our Lord Jesus was in travail of soul for our
redemption and salvation, in great pain, but with longing desire to be
delivered, and all the pains and throes he underwent were in order to it
and hastened it on. \[2.\] Christ does and will see the blessed fruit of
the travail of his soul in the founding and building up of his church
and the eternal salvation of all that were given him. He will not come
short of his end in any part of his work, but will himself see that he
has not laboured in vain. \[3.\] The salvation of souls is a great
satisfaction to the Lord Jesus. He will reckon all his pains well
bestowed, and himself abundantly recompensed, if the many sons be by him
brought through grace to glory. Let him have this, and he has enough.
God will be glorified, penitent believers will be justified, and then
Christ will be satisfied. Thus, in conformity to Christ, it should be a
satisfaction to us if we can do any thing to serve the interests of
God's kingdom in the world. Let it always be our meat and drink, as it
was Christ's, to do God's will.

2\. He shall have the glory of bringing in an everlasting righteousness;
for so it was foretold concerning him, [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md). And here, to the same purport,
By his knowledge (the knowledge of him, and faith in him) shall my
righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear the sins of many, and
so lay a foundation for our justification from sin. Note, (1.) The great
privilege that flows to us from the death of Christ is justification
from sin, our being acquitted from that guilt which alone can ruin us,
and accepted into God's favour, which alone can make us happy. (2.)
Christ, who purchased our justification for us, applies it to us, by his
intercession made for us, his gospel preached to us, and his Spirit
witnessing in us. The Son of man had power even on earth to forgive sin.
(3.) There are many whom Christ justifies, not all (multitudes perish in
their sins), yet many, even as many as he gave his life a ransom for, as
many as the Lord our God shall call. He shall justify not here and there
one that is eminent and remarkable, but those of the many, the despised
multitude. (4.) It is by faith that we are justified, by our consent to
Christ and the covenant of grace; in this way we are saved, because thus
God is most glorified, free grace most advanced, self most abased, and
our happiness most effectually secured. (5.) Faith is the knowledge of
Christ, and without knowledge there can be no true faith. Christ's way
of gaining the will and affections is by enlightening the understanding
and bringing that unfeignedly to assent to divine truths. (6.) That
knowledge of Christ, and that faith in him, by which we are justified,
have reference to him both as a servant to God and as a surety for us.
\[1.\] As one that is employed for God to pursue his designs and secure
and advance the interests of his glory. "He is my righteous servant, and
as such justifies men." God has authorized and appointed him to do it;
it is according to God's will and for his honour that he does it. He is
himself righteous, and of his righteousness have all we received. He
that is himself righteous (for he could not have made atonement for our
sin if he had had any sin of his own to answer for) is made of God to us
righteousness, the Lord our righteousness. \[2.\] As one that has
undertaken for us. We must know him, and believe in him, as one that
bore our iniquities - saved us from sinking under the load by taking it
upon himself.

3\. He shall have the glory of obtaining an incontestable victory and
universal dominion, [Isa 53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012.md).
Because he has done all these good services, therefore will I divide him
a portion with the great, and, according to the will of the Father, he
shall divide the spoil with the strong, as a great general, when he has
driven the enemy out of the field, takes the plunder of it for himself
and his army, which is both an unquestionable evidence of the victory
and a recompense for all the toils and perils of the battle. Note, (1.)
God the Father has engaged to reward the services and sufferings of
Christ with great glory: "I will set him among the great, highly exalt
him, and give him a name above every name." Great riches are also
assigned to him: He shall divide the spoil, shall have abundance of
graces and comforts to bestow upon all his faithful soldiers. (2.)
Christ comes at his glory by conquest. He has set upon the strong man
armed, dispossessed him, and divided the spoil. He has vanquished
principalities and powers, sin and Satan, death and hell, the world and
the flesh; these are the strong that he has disarmed and taken the spoil
of. (3.) Much of the glory with which Christ is recompensed, and the
spoil which he has divided, consists in the vast multitudes of willing,
faithful, loyal subjects, that shall be brought in to him; for so some
read it: I will give many to him, and he shall obtain many for a spoil.
God will give him the heathen for his inheritance and the uttermost
parts of the earth for his possession, [Psa
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008.md). His dominion shall be from sea to
sea. Many shall be wrought upon by the grace of God to give up
themselves to him to be ruled, and taught, and saved by him, and hereby
he shall reckon himself honoured, and enriched, and abundantly
recompensed for all he did and all he suffered. (4.) What God designed
for the Redeemer he shall certainly gain the possession of: "I will
divide it to him," and immediately it follows, He shall divide it,
notwithstanding the opposition that is given to him; for, as Christ
finished the work that was given him to do, so God completed the
recompence that was promised him for it; for he is both able and
faithful. (5.) The spoil which God divided to Christ he divides (it is
the same word), he distributes, among his followers; for, when he led
captivity captive, he received gifts for men, that he might give gifts
to men; for as he has told us ([Act
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#035).md) he did himself reckon it more
blessed and honourable to give than to receive. Christ conquered for us,
and through him we are more than conquerors. He has divided the spoils,
the fruits of his conquest, to all that are his: let us therefore cast
in our lot among them.
