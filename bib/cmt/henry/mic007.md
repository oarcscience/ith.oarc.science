### [Micah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#001.md)

[Micah](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mic 7:0</span></span>

In this chapter, I. The prophet, in the name of the church, sadly
laments the woeful decay of religion in the age wherein he lived, and
the deluge of impiety and immorality which overwhelmed the nation, which
levelled the differences, and bore down the fences, of all that is just
and sacred ([Mic 7:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#001).md). II. The
prophet, for the sake of the church, prescribes comforts, which may be
of use at such a time, and gives counsel what to do. 1. They must have
an eye to God ([Mic 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#007).md). 2. They must
courageously bear up against the insolences of the enemy ([Mic
7:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#008).md). 3. They must patiently lie
down under the rebukes of their God ([Mic
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#009).md). 4. They must expect no other
than that the trouble would continue long, and must endeavour to make
the best of it ([Mic 7:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#011).md). 5. They
must encourage themselves with God's promises, in answer to the
prophet's prayers ([Mic 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014.md), [Mic
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#015).md). 6. They must foresee the fall
of their enemies, that now triumphed over them ([Mic
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#016.md), [Mic
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#017).md). 7. They must themselves triumph
in the mercy and grace of God, and his faithfulness to his covenant
([Mic 7:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018).md), and with that
comfortable word the prophecy concludes.

[Micah 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 7:1</span></span>

This is such a description of bad times as, some think, could scarcely
agree to the times of Hezekiah, when this prophet prophesied; and
therefore they rather take it as a prediction of what should be in the
reign of Manasseh. But we may rather suppose it to be in the reign of
Ahaz (and in that reign he prophesied, ch. 1:1) or in the beginning of
Hezekiah's time, before the reformation he was instrumental in; nay, in
the best of his days, and when he had done his best to purge out
corruptions, still there was much amiss. The prophet cries out, Woe is
me! He bemoans himself that his lot was cast in such a degenerate age,
and thinks it his great unhappiness that he lived among a people that
were ripening apace for a ruin which many a good man would unavoidably
be involved in. Thus David cries out, Woe is me that I sojourn in
Mesech! He laments, 1. That there were so few good people to be found,
even among those that were God's people; and this was their reproach:
The good man has perished out of the earth, or out of the land, the land
of Canaan; it was a good land, and a land of uprightness ([Isa
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#010).md), but there were few good men in
it, none upright among them, [Mic 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#002.md).
The good man is a godly man and a merciful man; the word signifies both.
Those are completely good men that are devout towards God and
compassionate and beneficent towards men, that love mercy and walk with
God. "These have perished; those few honest men that some time ago
enriched and adorned our country are now dead and gone, and there are
none risen up in their stead that tread in their steps; honesty is
banished, and there is no such thing as a good man to be met with. Those
that were of religious education have degenerated, and become as bad as
the worst; the godly man ceases," [Psa
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#001.md). This is illustrated by a
comparison ([Mic 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#001).md): they were as
when they have gathered the summer fruits; it was as hard a thing to
find a good man as to find any of the summer-fruits (which were the
choicest and best, and therefore must carefully be gathered in) when the
harvest is over. The prophet is ready to say, as Elijah in his time
([Kg1 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#010).md), I, even I only, am left.
Good men, who used to hang in clusters, are now as the grape-gleanings
of the vintage, here and there a berry, [Isa
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#006.md). You can find no societies of
them as bunches of grapes, but those that are are single persons: There
is no cluster to eat; and the best and fullest grapes are those that
grow in large clusters. Some think that this intimates not only that
good people were few, but that those few who remained, who went for good
people, were good for little, like the small withered grapes, the refuse
that were left behind, not only by the gatherer, but by the gleaner.
When the prophet observed this universal degeneracy it made him desire
the first-ripe fruit; he wished to see such worthy good men as were in
the former ages, were the ornaments of the primitive times, and as far
excelled the best of all the present age as the first and full-ripe
fruits do those of the latter growth, that never come to maturity. When
we read and hear of the wisdom and zeal, the strictness and
conscientiousness, the devotion and charity, of the professors of
religion in former ages, and see the reverse of this in those of the
present age, we cannot but sit down, and wish, with a sigh, O for
primitive Christianity again! Where are the plainness and integrity of
those that went before us? Where are the Israelites indeed, without
guile? Our souls desire them, but in vain. The golden age is gone, and
past recall; we must make the best of what is, for we are not likely to
see such times as have been. 2. That there were so many wicked
mischievous people among them, not only none that did any good, but
multitudes that did all the hurt they could: "They all lie in wait for
blood, and hunt every man his brother. To get wealth to themselves, they
care not what wrong, what hurt, they do to their neighbours and nearest
relations. They act as if mankind were in a state of war, and force were
the only right. They are as beasts of prey to their neighbours, for they
all lie in wait for blood as lions for their prey; they thirst after it,
make nothing of taking away any man's life or livelihood to serve a turn
for themselves, and lie in wait for an opportunity to do it. Their
neighbours are as beasts of prey to them, for they hunt every man his
brother with a net; they persecute them as noxious creatures, fit to be
taken and destroyed, though they are innocent excellent ones." We say of
him that is outlawed, Caput gerit lupinum - He is to be hunted as a
wolf. "Or they hunt them as men do the game, to feast upon it; they have
a thousand cursed arts of ensnaring men to their ruin, so that they may
but get by it. Thus they do mischief with both hands earnestly; their
hearts desire it, their heads contrive it, and then both hands are ready
to put it in execution." Note, The more eager and intent men are upon
any sinful pursuit, and the more pains they take in it, the more
provoking it is. 3. That the magistrates, who by their office ought to
have been the patrons and protectors of right, were the practicers and
promoters of wrong: That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, to
excite and animate themselves in it, the prince asketh, and the judge
asketh, for a reward, for a bribe, with which they well be hired to
exert all their power for the supporting and carrying on of any wicked
design with both hands. They do evil with both hands well (so some read
it); they do evil with a great deal of art and dexterity; they praise
themselves for doing it so well. Others read it thus: To do evil they
have both hands (they catch at an opportunity of doing mischief), but to
do good the prince and the judge ask for a reward; if they do any good
offices they are mercenary in them, and must be paid for them. The great
man, who has wealth and power to do good, is not ashamed to utter his
mischievous desire in conjunction with the prince and the judge, who are
ready to support him and stand by him in it. So they wrap it up; they
perplex the matter, involve it, and make it intricate (so some
understand it), that they may lose equity in a mist, and so make the
cause turn which way they please. It is ill with a people when their
princes, and judges, and great men are in a confederacy to pervert
justice. And it is a sad character that is given of them ([Mic
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#004).md), that the best of them is as a
brier, and the most upright is sharper than a thorn-hedge; it is a
dangerous thing to have any thing to do with them; he that touches them
must be fenced with iron ([Sa2 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#006.md),
[Sa2 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#007).md), he shall be sure to be
scratched, to have his clothes torn, and his eyes almost pulled out.
And, if this be the character of the best and most upright, what are the
worst? And, when things have come to this pass, the day of thy watchmen
comes, that is, as it follows, the day of thy visitation, when God will
reckon with thee for all this wickedness, which is called the day of the
watchmen, because their prophets, whom God set as watchmen over them,
had often warned them of that day. When all flesh have corrupted their
way, even the best and the most upright, what can be expected but a day
of visitation, a deluge of judgments, as that which drowned the old
world when the earth was filled with violence? 4. That there was no
faith in man; people had grown so universally treacherous that one knew
not whom to repose any confidence in, [Mic
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#005.md). "Those that have any sense of
honour, or spark of virtue, remaining in them, have a firm regard to the
laws of friendship; they would not discover what passed in private
conversation, nor divulge secrets, to the prejudice of a friend. But
those things are now made a jest of; you will not meet with a friend
that you dare trust, whose word you dare take, or who will have any
tenderness or concern for you; so that wise men shall give it and take
it for a rule, trust you not in a friend, for you will find him false,
you can trust him no further than you can see him; and even him that
passes for an honest man you will find to be so only with good looking
to. Nay, as for him that undertakes to be your guide, to lead you into
any business which he professes to understand better than you, you
cannot put a confidence in him, for he will be sure to mislead you if he
can get any thing by it." Some by a guide understand a husband, who is
called the guide of thy youth; and that agrees well enough with what
follows, "Keep the doors of thy lips from her that lieth in thy bosom,
from thy own wife; take heed what thou sayest before her, lest she
betray thee, as Delilah did Samson, lest she be the bird of the air that
carries the voice of that which thou sayest in thy bed-chamber," [Ecc
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#020.md). It is an evil time indeed when
the prudent are obliged even thus far to keep silence. 5. That children
were abusive to their parents, and men had no comfort, no satisfaction,
in their own families and their nearest relations, [Mic
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#006.md). The times are bad indeed when the
son dishonours his father, gives him bad language, exposes him,
threatens him, and studies to do him a mischief, when the daughter rises
up in rebellion against her own mother, having no sense of duty, or
natural affection; and no marvel that then the daughter-in-law quarrels
with her mother-in-law, and is vexatious to her. Either they cannot
agree about their property and interest, or their humours and passions
clash, or from a spirit of bigotry and persecution, the brother shall
deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child, [Mat
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#004.md); [Luk
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#016.md). It is sad when a man's
betrayers and worst enemies are the men of his own house, his own
children and servants, that should be his guard and his best friends.
Note, The contempt and violation of the laws of domestic duties are a
sad symptom of a universal corruption of manners. Those are never likely
to come to good that are undutiful to their parents, and study to be
provoking to them and cross them.

[Micah 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mic 7:7</span></span>

The prophet, having sadly complained of the wickedness of the times he
lived in, here fastens upon some considerations for the comfort of
himself and his friends, in reference thereunto. The case is bad, but it
is not desperate. Yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.

I. "Though God be now displeased he shall be reconciled to us, and then
all will be well, [Mic 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#007.md), [Mic
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#009.md). We are now under the indignation
of the Lord; God is angry with us, and justly, because we have sinned
against him." Note, It is our sin against God that provokes his
indignation against us; and we must see it, and own it, whenever we are
under divine rebukes, that we may justify God, and may study to answer
his end in afflicting us, by repenting of sin and breaking off from it.
Now, at such a time, 1. We must have recourse to God under our troubles
([Mic 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#007).md): Therefore I will look unto
the Lord. When a child of God has ever so much occasion to cry, Woe is
me (as the prophet here, [Mic 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#001).md),
yet it may be a comfort to him that he has a God to look to, a God to
come to, to fly to, in whom he may rejoice and have satisfaction. All
may look bright above him when all looks black and dark about him. The
prophet had been complaining that there was no comfort to be had, no
confidence to be put, in friends and relations on earth, and this drives
him to his God: Therefore I will look unto the Lord. The less reason we
have to delight in any creature the more reason we have to delight in
God. If princes are not to be trusted, we may say, Happy is the man that
has the God of Jacob for his help, and happy am I, even in the midst of
my present woes, if he be my help. If men be false, this is our comfort,
that God is faithful; if relations be unkind, he is and will be
gracious. Let us therefore look above and beyond them, and overlook our
disappointment in them, and look unto the Lord. 2. We must submit to the
will of God in our troubles: "I will bear the indignation of the Lord,
will bear it patiently, without murmuring and repining, because I have
sinned against him." Note, Those that are truly penitent for sin will
see a great deal of reason to be patient under affliction. Wherefore
should a man complain for the punishment of his sin? When we complain to
God of the badness of the times we ought to complain against ourselves
for the badness of our own hearts. 3. We must depend upon God to work
deliverance for us, and put a good issue to our troubles in due time; we
must not only look to him, but look for him: "I will wait for the God of
my salvation, and for his gracious returns to me." In our greatest
distresses we shall see no reason to despair of salvation if by faith we
eye God as the God of our salvation, who is able to save the weakest
upon their humble petition, and willing to save the worst upon their
true repentance. And, if we depend on God as the God of our salvation,
we must wait for him, and for his salvation, in his own way and his own
time. Let us now see what the church is here taught to expect and
promise herself from God, even when things are brought to the last
extremity. (1.) My God will hear me; if the Lord be our God, he will
hear our prayers, and grant an answer of peace to them. (2.) "When I
fall, and am in danger of being dashed in pieces by the fall, yet I
shall arise, and recover myself again. I fall, but am not utterly cast
down," [Psa 37:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#024). (3..md) "When I sit in
darkness, desolate and disconsolate, melancholy and perplexed, and not
knowing what to do, nor which way to look for relief, yet then the Lord
shall be a light to me, to comfort and revive me, to instruct and teach
me, to direct and guide me, as a light to my eyes, a light to my feet, a
light in a dark place." (4.) He will plead my cause, and execute
judgment for me, [Mic 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#009.md). If we
heartily espouse the cause of God, the just but injured cause of
religion and virtue, and make it our cause, we may hope he will own our
cause, and plead it. The church's cause, though it seem for a time to go
against her, will at length be pleaded with jealousy, and judgment not
only given against, but executed upon, the enemies of it. (5.) "He will
bring me forth to the light, make me shine eminently out of obscurity,
and become conspicuous, will make my righteousness shine evidently from
under the dark cloud of calumny, [Psa
37:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#006.md); [Isa
58:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#010.md). The morning of comfort shall
shine forth out of the long and dark night of trouble." (6.) "I shall
behold his righteousness; I shall see the equity of his proceedings
concerning me and the performance of his promises to me."

II\. Though enemies triumph and insult, they shall be silenced and put
to shame, [Mic 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#008.md), [Mic
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#010.md). Observe here,

1\. How proudly the enemies of God's people trample upon them in their
distress. They said, Where is the Lord their God? As if because they
were afflicted God had forsaken them, and they knew not where to find
him with their prayers, and he knew not how to help them with his
favours. This David's enemies said to him, and it was a sword in his
bones, [Psa 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#010.md), and see [Psa
115:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#002.md). Thus, in reproaching Israel as
an abandoned people, they reflected on the God of Israel as an unkind
unfaithful God.

2\. How comfortably the people of God by faith bear up themselves under
these insults ([Mic 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#008).md): "Rejoice not
against me, O my enemy! I am now down, but shall not be always so, and
when my God appears for me then she that is my enemy shall see it, and
be ashamed" (not only being disappointed in her expectations of the
church's utter ruin, but having the same cup of trembling put into her
hand), "then my eyes shall behold her in the same deplorable condition
that I am now in; now shall she be trodden down." Note, The deliverance
of the church will be the confusion of her enemies; and their shame
shall be double, when, as they have trampled upon God's people, so they
shall themselves be trampled upon.

III\. Though the land continue a great while desolate, yet it shall at
length be replenished again, when the time, even the set time, of its
deliverance comes. 1. Its salvation shall not come till after it has
been desolate; so the margin reads it, [Mic
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#013.md). God has a controversy with the
land, and it must lie long under his rebukes, because of those that
dwell therein; it is their iniquity that makes their land desolate ([Psa
107:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#034).md); it is for the fruit of their
doings, their evil doings which they have been themselves guilty of, and
the evil fruit of them, the sins of others, which they have been
accessory to by their bad influence and example. For this they must
expect to smart a great while; for the world shall know that God hates
sin even in his own people. 2. When it does come it shall be a complete
salvation; and it seems to refer to their deliverance out of Babylon by
Cyrus, which Isaiah about this time prophesied of, as a type of our
redemption by Christ. (1.) The decree shall be far removed. God's decree
concerning their captivity, and Nebuchadnezzar's decree concerning the
perpetuity of it, his resolution never to release them, "these shall be
set aside and revoked, and you shall hear no more of them; they shall no
more lie as a yoke upon thy neck." (2.) Jerusalem and the cities of
Judah shall be again reared: Then thy walls shall be built, walls for
habitation, walls for defence, house-walls, town-walls, temple-walls; it
is in order to these that the decree is repealed, [Isa
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028.md). Though Zion's walls may lie
long in ruins, there will come a day when they shall be repaired. (3.)
All that belong to the land of Israel, whithersoever dispersed, and
howsoever distressed, far and wide over the face of the whole earth,
shall come flocking to it again ([Mic
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#012).md): He shall come even to thee,
having liberty to return and a heart to return, from Assyria, whither
the ten tribes were carried away, though it lay remote, and from the
fortified cities, and from the fortress, those strongholds in which they
thought they had them fast; for when God's time comes, though Pharaoh
will not let the people go, God will fetch them out with a high hand.
They shall come from all the remote parts, from sea to sea and from
mountain to mountain, not turning back for fear of your discouragements,
but they shall go from strength to strength till they come to Zion. Thus
in the great day of redemption God will gather his elect from the four
winds.

[Micah 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mic 7:14</span></span>

Here is, I. The prophet's prayer to God to take care of his own people,
and of their cause and interest, [Mic
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014.md). When God is about to deliver his
people he stirs up their friends to pray for them, and pours out a
spirit of grace and supplication, [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md). And when we see God coming
towards us in ways of mercy, we must go forth to meet him by prayer. It
is a prophetic prayer, which amounts to a promise of the good prayed
for; what God directed his prophet to ask no doubt he designed to give.
Now, 1. The people of Israel are here called the flock of God's
heritage, for they are the sheep of his hand, the sheep of his pasture,
his little flock in the world; and they are his heritage, his portion in
the world. Jacob is the lot of his inheritance. 2. This flock dwells
solitarily in the wood, or forest, in the midst of Carmel, a high
mountain. Israel was a peculiar people, that dwelt alone, and was not
reckoned among the nations, like a flock of sheep in a wood. They were
now a desolate people ([Mic 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#013).md),
were in the land of their captivity as sheep in a forest, in danger of
being lost and made a prey of to the beasts of the forest. They are
scattered upon the mountains as sheep having no shepherd. 3. He prays
that God would feed them there with his rod, that is, that he would take
care of them in their captivity, would protect them, and provide for
them, and do the part of a good shepherd to them: "Let thy rod and staff
comfort them, even in that darksome valley; and even there let them want
nothing that is good for them. Let them be governed by thy rod, not the
rod of their enemies, for they are thy people." 4. He prays that God
would in due time bring them back to feed in the plains of Bashan and
Gilead, and no longer to be fed in the woods and mountains. Let them
feed in their own country again, as in the days of old. Some apply this
spiritually, and make it either the prophet's prayer to Christ or his
Father's charge to him, to take care of his church, as the great
Shepherd of the sheep, and to go in and out before them while they are
here in this world as in a wood, that they may find pasture as in
Carmel, as in Bashan and Gilead.

II\. God's promise, in answer to this prayer; and we may well take God's
promises as real answers to the prayers of faith, and embrace them
accordingly, for with him saying and doing are not two things. The
prophet prayed that God would feed them, and do kind things for them;
but God answers that he will show them marvellous things ([Mic
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#015).md), will do for them more than they
are able to ask or think, will out-do their hopes and expectations; he
will show them his marvellous lovingkindness, [Psa
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#007.md). 1. He will do that for them
which shall be the repetition of the wonders and miracles of former ages
- according to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt. Their
deliverance out of Babylon shall be a work of wonder and grace not
inferior to their deliverance out of Egypt, nay, it shall eclipse the
lustre of that ([Jer 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#014.md), [Jer
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#015).md), much more shall the work of
redemption by Christ. Note, God's former favours to his church are
patterns of future favours, and shall again be copied out as there is
occasion. 2. He will do that for them which shall be matter of wonder
and amazement to the present age, [Mic
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#016.md), [Mic
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#017.md). The nations about shall take
notice of it, and it shall be said among the heathen, The Lord has done
great things for them, [Psa 126:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#002.md). The
impression which the deliverance of the Jews out of Babylon shall make
upon the neighbouring nations shall be very much for the honour both of
God and his church. (1.) Those that had insulted over the people of God
in their distress, and gloried that when they had them down they would
keep them down, shall be confounded, when they see them thus
surprisingly rising up; they shall be confounded at all the might with
which the captives shall now exert themselves, whom they thought for
ever disabled. They shall now lay their hands upon their mouths, as
being ashamed of what they have said, and not able to say more, by way
of triumph over Israel. Nay, their ears shall be deaf too, so much shall
they be ashamed at the wonderful deliverance; they shall stop their
ears, as being not willing to hear any more of God's wonders wrought for
that people, whom they had so despised and insulted over. (2.) Those
that had impudently confronted God himself shall now be struck with a
fear of him, and thereby brought, in profession at least, to submit to
him (v. 17): They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall be so
mortified, as if they were sentenced to the same curse the serpent was
laid under ([Gen 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#014).md), Upon thy belly
shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat. They shall be brought to the
lowest abasements imaginable, and shall be so dispirited that they shall
tamely submit to them. His enemies shall lick the dust, [Psa
72:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#009.md). Nay, they shall lick the dust of
the church's feet, [Isa 49:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023.md). Proud
oppressors shall now be made sensible how mean, how little, they are,
before the great God, and they shall with trembling and the lowest
submission move out of the holes into which they had crept ([Isa
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#021).md), like worms of the earth as they
are, being ashamed and afraid to show their heads; so low shall they be
brought, and such abjects shall they be, when they are abased. When God
did wonders for his church many of the people of the land became Jews,
because the fear of the Jews, and of their God, fell upon them, [Est
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#017.md). So it is promised here: They
shall be afraid of the Lord our God, and shall fear because of thee, O
Israel! Forced submissions are often but feigned submissions; yet they
redound to the glory of God and the church, though not to the benefit of
the dissemblers themselves.

III\. The prophet's thankful acknowledgment of God's mercy, in the name
of the church, with a believing dependence upon his promise, [Mic
7:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018.md). We are here taught,

1\. To give to God the glory of his pardoning mercy, [Mic
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018.md). God having promised to bring
back the captivity of his people, the prophet, on that occasion, admires
pardoning mercy, as that which was at the bottom of it. As it was their
sin that brought them into bondage, so it was God's pardoning their sin
that brought them our of it; [Psa
85:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001.md), [Psa
85:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#002.md), and [Isa
33:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#024.md); [Isa
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#017.md); [Isa
60:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001.md), [Isa
60:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#002.md). The pardon of sin is the
foundation of all other covenant-mercies, [Heb
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#012.md). This the prophet stands amazed
at, while the surrounding nations stood amazed only at those
deliverances which were but the fruits of this. Note, (1.) God's people,
who are the remnant of his heritage, stand charged with many
transgressions; being but a remnant, a very few, one would hope they
should all be very good, but they are not so; God's children have their
spots, and often offend their Father. (2.) The gracious God is ready to
pass by and pardon the iniquity and transgression of his people, upon
their repentance and return to him. God's people are a pardoned people,
and to this they owe their all. When God pardons sin, he passes it by,
does not punish it as justly he might, nor deal with the sinner
according to the desert of it. (3.) Though God may for a time lay his
own people under the tokens of his displeasure, yet he will not retain
his anger for ever, but though he cause grief he will have compassion;
he is not implacable; yet against those that are not of the remnant of
his heritage, that are unpardoned, he will keep his anger for ever. (4.)
The reasons why God pardons sin, and keeps not his anger for ever, are
all taken from within himself; it is because he delights in mercy, and
the salvation of sinners is what he has pleasure in, not their death and
damnation. (5.) The glory of God in forgiving sin is, as in other
things, matchless, and without compare. There is no God like unto him
for this; no magistrate, no common person, forgives as God does. In this
his thoughts and ways are infinitely above ours; in this he is God, and
not man. (6.) All those that have experienced pardoning mercy cannot but
admire that mercy; it is what we have reason to stand amazed at, if we
know what it is. Has God forgiven us our transgressions? We may well
say, Who is a God like unto thee? Our holy wonder at pardoning mercy
will be a good evidence of our interest in it.

2\. To take to ourselves the comfort of that mercy and all the grace and
truth that go along with it. God's people here, as they look back with
thankfulness upon God's pardoning their sins, so they look forward with
assurance upon what he would yet further do for them. His mercy endures
for ever, and therefore as he has shown mercy so he will, [Mic
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#019.md), [Mic
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#020). (1..md) He will renew his favours
to us: He will turn again; he will have compassion; that is, he will
again have compassion upon us as formerly he had; his compassions shall
be new every morning; he seemed to be departing from us in anger, but he
will turn again and pity us. He will turn us to himself, and then will
turn to us, and have mercy upon us. (2.) He will renew us, to prepare
and qualify us for his favour: He will subdue our iniquities; when he
takes away the guilt of sin, that it may not damn us, he will break the
power of sin, that it may not have dominion over us, that we may not
fear sin, nor be led captive by it. Sin is an enemy that fights against
us, a tyrant that oppresses us; nothing less than almighty grace can
subdue it, so great is its power in fallen man and so long has it kept
possession. But, if God forgive the sin that has been committed by us,
he will subdue the sin that dwells in us, and in that there is none like
him in forgiving; and all those whose sins are pardoned earnestly desire
and hope; to have their corruptions mortified and their iniquities
subdued, and please themselves with the hopes of it. If we be left to
ourselves, our iniquities will be too hard for us; but God's grace, we
trust, shall be sufficient for us to subdue them, so that they shall not
rule us, and then they shall not ruin us. (3.) He will confirm this good
work, and effectually provide that his act of grace shall never be
repealed: Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depth of the sea, as
when he brought them out of Egypt (to which he has an eye in the
promises here, [Mic 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#015).md) he subdued
Pharaoh and the Egyptians, and cast them into the depth of the sea. It
intimates that when God forgives sin he remembers it no more, and takes
care that it shall never be remembered more against the sinner. [Eze
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#022.md), His transgressions shall not be
mentioned unto him; they are blotted out as a cloud which never appears
more. He casts them into the sea, not near the shore-side, where they
may appear again next low water, but into the depth of the sea, never to
rise again. All their sins shall be cast there without exception, for
when God forgives sin he forgives all. (4.) He will perfect that which
concerns us, and with this good work will do all that for us which our
case requires and which he has promised ([Mic
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#020).md): Then wilt thou perform thy
truth to Jacob and thy mercy to Abraham. It is in pursuance of the
covenant that our sins are pardoned and our lusts mortified; from that
spring all these streams flow, and with these he shall freely give us
all things. The promise is said to be mercy to Abraham, because, as made
to him first, it was mere mercy, preventing mercy, considering what
state it found him in. But it was truth to Jacob, because the
faithfulness of God was engaged to make good to him and his seed, as
heirs to Abraham, all that was graciously promised to Abraham. See here,
\[1.\] With what solemnity the covenant of grace is ratified to us; it
was not only spoken, written, and sealed, but which is the highest
confirmation, it was sworn to our fathers; nor is it a modern project,
but is confirmed by antiquity too; it was sworn from the days of old; it
is an ancient charter. \[2.\] With what satisfaction it may be applied
and relied upon by us; we may say with the highest assurance, Thou wilt
perform the truth and mercy; not one iota or tittle of it shall fall to
the ground. Faithful is he that has promised, who also will do it.
