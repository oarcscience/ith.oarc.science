### [Esther Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#001.md)

[Esther](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">est 5:0</span></span>

The last news we had of Haman left him in his cups, [Est
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#015.md). Our last news of queen Esther
left her in tears, fasting and praying. Now this chapter brings in, I.
Esther in her joys, smiled upon by the king and honoured with his
company at her banquet of wine ([Est
5:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#001).md). II. Haman upon the fret,
because he had not Mordecai's cap and knee, and with great indignation
setting up a gallows for him ([Est
5:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#009).md). Thus those that sow in tears
shall reap in joy, but the triumphing of the wicked is short.

[Esther 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 5:1</span></span>

Here is, I. Esther's bold approach to the king, [Est
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#001.md). When the time appointed for their
fast was finished she lost no time, but on the third day, when the
impression of her devotions were fresh upon her spirit, she addressed
the king. When the heart is enlarged in communion with God it will be
emboldened in doing and suffering for him. Some think that the three
days' fast was only one whole day and two whole nights, in all which
time they did not take any food at all, and that this is called three
days, as Christ's lying in the grave so long is. This exposition is
favoured by the consideration that on the third day the queen made her
appearance at court. Resolutions which have difficulties and dangers to
break though should be pursued without delay, lest they cool and
slacken. What thou doest, which must be done boldly, do it quickly. Now
she put on her royal apparel, that she might the better recommend
herself to the king, and laid aside her fast-day clothes. She put on her
fine clothes, not to please herself, but her husband; in her prayer, as
we find in the Apocrypha (Esther 14:16), she thus appeals to God: Thou
knowest, Lord, I abhor the sign of my high estate which is upon my head,
in the days wherein I show myself, etc. Let hose whose rank obliges them
to wear rich clothes learn hence to be dead to them, and not make them
their adorning. She stood in the inner court over against the king,
expecting her doom, between hope and fear.

II\. The favourable reception which the king gave her. When he saw her
she obtained favour in his sight. The apocryphal author and Josephus say
that she took two maids with her, on one of whom she leaned, while the
other bore up her train, - that her countenance was cheerful and very
amiable, but her heart was in anguish, - that the king, lifting up his
countenance that shone with majesty, at first looked very fiercely upon
here, whereupon she grew pale, and fainted, and bowed herself on the
head of the maid that went by her; but then God changed the spirit of
the king, and, in a fear, he leaped from his throne, took her in his
arms till she came to herself, and comforted her with loving words. Here
we are only told,

1\. That he protected her from the law, and assured her of safety, by
holding out to her the golden sceptre ([Est
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#002).md), which she thankfully touched the
top of, thereby presenting herself to him as a humble petitioner. Thus
having had power with God and prevailed, like Jacob, she had power with
men too. He that will lose his life for God shall save it, or find it in
a better life.

2\. That he encouraged her address ([Est
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#003).md): What wilt thou, queen Esther,
and what is thy request? So far was he from counting her an offender
that he seemed glad to see her, and desirous to oblige her. He that had
divorced one wife for not coming when she was sent for would not be
severe to another for coming when she was not sent for. God can turn the
hearts of men, of great men, of those that act most arbitrarily, which
way he pleases towards us. Esther feared that she should perish, but was
promised that she should have what she might ask for, though it were the
half of the kingdom. Note, God in his providence often prevents the
fears, and outdoes the hopes, of his people, especially when they
venture in his cause. Let us from this story infer, as our Saviour does
from the parable of the unjust judge, an encouragement to pray always to
our God, and not faint, [Luk 18:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#006.md).
Hear what this haughty king says (What is thy petition, and what is thy
request? It shall be granted thee), and say shall not God hear and
answer the prayers of his own elect, that cry day and night to him?
Esther came to a proud imperious man; we come to the God of love and
grace. She was not called; we are: the Spirit says, Come, and the bride
says, Come. She had a law against her; we have a promise, many a
promise, in favour of us: Ask, and it shall be given you. She had no
friend to introduce her, or intercede for her, while on the contrary he
that was then the king's favourite was her enemy; but we have an
advocate with the Father, in whom he is well pleased. Let us therefore
come boldly to the throne of grace.

3\. That all the request she had to make to him, at this time, was that
he would please to come to a banquet which she had prepared for him, and
bring Haman along with him, [Est 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#004.md),
[Est 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#005). Hereby, (1..md) She would
intimate to him how much she valued his favour and company. Whatever she
had to ask, she desired his favour above any thing, and would purchase
it at any rate. (2.) She would try how he stood affected to her; for, if
he should refuse this, it would be to no purpose as yet to present her
other request. (3.) She would endeavour to bring him into a pleasant
humour, and soften his spirit, that he might with the more tenderness
receive the impressions of the complaint she had to make to him. (4.)
She would please him, by making court to Haman his favourite, and
inviting him to come whose company she knew he loved and whom she
desired to have present when she made her complaint; for she would say
nothing of him but what she durst say to his face. (5.) She hoped at the
banquet of wine to have a fairer and more favourable opportunity of
presenting her petition. Wisdom is profitable to direct how to manage
some men that are hard to deal with, and to take them by the right
handle.

4\. That he readily came, and ordered Haman to come along with him ([Est
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#005).md), which was an indication of the
kindness he still retained for her; if he really designed the
destruction of her and her people, he would not have accepted her
banquet. There he renewed his kind enquiry (What is thy petition?) and
his generous promise, that it should be granted, even to the half of the
kingdom ([Est 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#006).md), a proverbial
expression, by which he assured her that he would deny her nothing in
reason. Herod used it, [Mar 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#023.md).

5\. That then Esther thought fit to ask no more than a promise that he
would please to accept of another treat, the next day, in her apartment,
and Haman with him ([Est 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#007.md), [Est
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#008).md), intimating to him that then she
would let him know what her business was. This adjourning of the main
petition may be attributed, (1.) To Esther's prudence; thus she hoped
yet further to win upon him and ingratiate herself with him. Perhaps her
heart failed her now when she was going to make her request, and she
desired to take some further time for prayer, that God would give her a
mouth and wisdom. The putting of it off thus, it is likely, she knew
would be well taken as an expression of the great reverence she had for
the king, and her unwillingness to be too pressing upon him. What is
hastily asked is often as hastily denied; but what is asked with a pause
deserves to be considered. (2.) To God's providence putting it into
Esther's heart to delay her petition a day longer, she knew not why, but
God did, that what was to happen in the night intervening between this
and tomorrow might further her design and make way for her success, that
Haman might arrive at the highest pitch of malice against Mordecai and
might begin to fall before him. The Jews perhaps blamed Ester as
dilatory, and some of them began to suspect her sincerity, or at least
her zeal; but the event disproved their jealousy, and all was for the
best.

[Esther 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">est 5:9</span></span>

This account here given of Haman is a comment upon that of Solomon, [Pro
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#024.md). Proud and haughty scorner is
his name that deals in proud wrath. Never did any man more answer that
name than Haman, in whom pride and wrath had so much the ascendant. See
him,

I. Puffed up with the honour of being invited to Esther's feast. He was
joyful and glad of heart at it, [Est
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#009.md). Observe with what a high gust he
speaks of it ([Est 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#012).md), how he
values himself upon it, and how near he thinks it brings him to the
perfection of felicity, that Esther the queen did let no man come with
the king to the banquet but his mighty self, and he thought it was
because she was exceedingly charmed with his conversation that the next
day she had invited him also to come with the king; none so fit as he to
bear the king company. Note, Self-admirers and self-flatterers are
really self-deceivers. Haman pleased himself with the fancy that the
queen, by this repeated invitation, designed to honour him, whereas
really she designed to accuse him, and, in calling him to the banquet,
did but call him to the bar. What magnifying glasses do proud men look
at their faces in! And how does the pride of their heart deceive them!
[Oba 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#003.md).

II\. Vexing and fretting at the slight that Mordecai put upon him, and
thereby made uneasy to himself and to all about him. 1. Mordecai was as
determined as ever: He stood not up, nor moved for him, [Est
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#009.md). What he did was from a principle
of conscience, and therefore he persevered in it, and would not cringe
to Haman, no, not when he had reason to fear him and Esther herself
complimented him. He knew God could and would deliver him and his people
from the rage of Haman, without any such mean and sneaking expedients to
mollify him. Those that walk in holy sincerity may walk in holy
security, and go on in their work, not fearing what man can do unto
them. He that walks uprightly walks surely. 2. Haman can as ill bear it
as ever; nay, the higher he is lifted up, the more impatient is her of
contempt and the more enraged at it. (1.) It made his own spirit
restless, and put him into a grievous agitation. He was full of
indignation ([Est 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#009).md) and yet
refrained himself, [Est 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#010.md). Gladly
would he have drawn his sword and run Mordecai through for affronting
him thus; but he hoped shortly to see him fall with all the Jews, and
therefore with much ado prevailed with himself to forbear stabbing him.
What a struggle had he in his own bosom between his anger, which
required Mordecai's death immediately (O that I had of his flesh! I
cannot be satisfied! [Job 31:31](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#031).md), and
his malice, which had determined to wait for the general massacre! Thus
thorns and snares are in the way of the froward. (2.) It made all his
enjoyments sapless. This little affront which he received from Mordecai
was the dead fly which spoiled all his pot of precious ointment; he
himself owned in the presence of his wife and friends, to the
everlasting reproach of a proud and discontented mind, that he had no
comfort in his estate, preferment, and family, as long as Mordecai lived
and had a place in the king's gate, [Est
5:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#010.md). He took notice of his own
riches and honours, the numerousness of his family, and the high posts
to which he was advanced, that he was the darling of the prince and the
idol of the court; and yet all this avails him nothing as long as
Mordecai is unhanged. Those that are disposed to be uneasy will never
want something or other to be uneasy at; and proud men, though they have
much to their mind, yet, if they have not all to their mind, it is as
nothing to them. The thousandth part of what Haman had would serve to
make a humble modest man as much of a happiness as he expects from this
world; and yet Haman complained as passionately as if he had been sunk
into the lowest degree of poverty and disgrace.

III\. Meditating revenge, and assisted therein by his wife and his
friends, [Est 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#014.md). They saw how
gladly he would dispense with his own resolution of deferring the
slaughter till the time determined by the lot, and therefore advised him
to take an earnest and foretaste of the satisfaction he then expected in
the speedy execution of Mordecai; let him have that to please him at the
moment; and having, as he thought, made sure the destruction of all the
Jews, at the time appointed, he will not think scorn, for the present,
to lay hands on Mordecai alone. 1. For the pleasing of his fancy they
advise him to get a gallows ready, and have it set up before his own
door, that, as soon as ever he could get the warrant signed, there might
be no delay of the execution; he would not need so much as to stay the
making of the gallows. This is very agreeable to Haman, who has the
gallows made and fixed immediately; it must be fifty cubits high, or as
near that as might be, for the greater disgrace of Mordecai and to make
him a spectacle to every one that passed by; and it must be before
Haman's door, that all men might take notice it was to the idol of his
revenge that Mordecai was sacrificed and that he might feed his eyes
with the sight. 2. For the gaining of his point they advise him to go
early in the morning to the king, and get an order from him for the
hanging of Mordecai, which, they doubted not, would be readily granted
to one who was so much the king's favourite and who had so easily
obtained an edict for the destruction of the whole nation of the Jews.
There needed no feigned suggestion; it was enough if he let the king
know that Mordecai, in contempt of the king's command, refused to
reverence him. And now we leave Haman to go to bed, pleased with the
thoughts of seeing Mordecai hanged the next day, and then going merrily
to the banquet, and not dreaming of handselling his own gallows.
