### [Psalms Chapter 108](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 108:0</span></span>

This psalm begins with praise and concludes with prayer, and faith is at
work in both. I. David here gives thanks to God for mercies to himself
([Psa 108:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001).md). II. He prays to God
for mercies for the land, pleading the promises of God and putting them
in suit ([Psa 108:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#006).md). The former
part it taken out of [Psa 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md), etc.,
the latter out of [Psa 60:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#005.md), etc., and
both with very little variation, to teach us that we may in prayer use
the same words that we have formerly used, provided it be with new
affections. It intimates likewise that it is not only allowable, but
sometimes convenient, to gather some verses out of one psalm and some
out of another, and to put them together, to be sung to the glory of
God. In singing this psalm we must give glory to God and take comfort to
ourselves.

A song or psalm of David.

[Psalms 108:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 108:1</span></span>

We may here learn how to praise God from the example of one who was
master of the art. 1. We must praise God with fixedness of heart. Our
heart must be employed in the duty (else we make nothing of it) and
engaged to the duty ([Psa 108:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001).md): O
God! my heart is fixed, and then I will sing and give praise. Wandering
straggling thoughts must be gathered in, and kept close to the business;
for they must be told that here is work enough for them all. 2. We must
praise God with freeness of expression: I will praise him with my glory,
that is, with my tongue. Our tongue is our glory, and never more so than
when it is employed in praising God. When the heart is inditing this
good matter our tongue must be as the pen of a ready writer, [Psa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001.md). David's skill in music was his
glory, it made him famous, and this should be consecrated to the praise
of God; and therefore it follows, Awake my psaltery and harp. Whatever
gift we excel in we must praise God with. 3. We must praise God with
fervency of affection, and must stir up ourselves to do it, that it may
be done in a lively manner and not carelessly ([Psa
108:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#002).md): Awake, psaltery and harp; let
it not be done with a dull and sleepy tune, but let the airs be all
lively. I myself will awake early to do it, with all that is within me,
and all little enough. Warm devotions honour God. 4. We must praise God
publicly, as those that are not ashamed to own our obligations to him
and our thankful sense of his favours, but desire that others also may
be in like manner affected with the divine goodness ([Psa
108:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#003).md): I will praise thee among the
people of the Jews; nay, I will sing to thee among the nations of the
earth. Whatever company we are in we must take all occasions to speak
well of God; and we must not be shy of singing psalms, though our
neighbours hear us, for it looks like being ashamed of our Master. 5. We
must, in our praises, magnify the mercy and truth of God in a special
manner ([Psa 108:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#004).md), mercy in
promising, truth in performing. The heavens are vast, but the mercy of
God is more capacious; the skies are high and bright, but the truth of
God is more eminent, more illustrious. We cannot see further than the
heavens and clouds; whatever we see of God's mercy and truth there is
still more to be seen, more reserved to be seen, in the other world. 6.
Since we find ourselves so, defective in glorifying God, we must beg of
him to glorify himself, to do all, to dispose all, to his own glory, to
get himself honour and make himself a name ([Psa
108:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#005).md): Be thou exalted, O God! above
the heavens, higher than the angels themselves can exalt thee with their
praises, and let thy glory be spread over all the earth. Father, glorify
thy own name. Thou hast glorified it; glorify it again. It is to be our
first petition, Hallowed be thy name.

[Psalms 108:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 108:6</span></span>

We may here learn how to pray as well as praise. 1. We must be
public-spirited in prayer, and bear upon our hearts, at the throne of
grace, the concerns of the church of God, [Psa
108:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#006.md). It is God's beloved, and
therefore must be ours; and therefore we must pray for its deliverance,
and reckon that we are answered if God grant what we ask for his church,
though he delay to give us what we ask for ourselves. "Save thy church,
and thou answerest me; I have what I would have." Let the earth be
filled with God's glory, and the prayers of David are ended ([Psa
72:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#019.md), [Psa
72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020).md); he desires no more. 2. We
must, in prayer, act faith upon the power and promise of God - upon his
power (Save with thy right hand, which is mighty to save), and upon his
promise: God has spoken in his holiness, in his holy word, to which he
has sworn by his holiness, and therefore I will rejoice, [Psa
108:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#007.md). What he has promised he will
perform, for it is the word both of his truth and of his power. An
active faith can rejoice in what God has said, though it be not yet
done; for with him saying and doing are not two things, whatever they
are with us. 3. We must, in prayer, take the comfort of what God has
secured to us and settled upon us, though we are not yet put in
possession of it. God had promised David to give him, (1.) The hearts of
his subjects; and therefore he surveys the several parts of the country
as his own already: "Shechem and Succoth, Gilead and Manasseh, Ephraim
and Judah, are all my own," [Psa
108:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#008.md). With such assurance as this we
may speak of the performance of what God has promised to the Son of
David; he will, without fail, give him the heathen for his inheritance
and the utmost parts of the earth for his possession, for so has he
spoken in his holiness; nay, of all the particular persons that were
given him he will lose none; he also, as David, shall have the hearts of
his subjects, [Joh 6:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037). And, (2..md) The
necks of his enemies. These are promised, and therefore David looks upon
Moab, and Edom, and Philistia, as his own already ([Psa
108:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#009).md): Over Philistia will I triumph,
which explains [Psa 60:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#008.md), Philistia,
triumph thou because of me, which some think should be read, O my soul!
triumph thou over Philistia. Thus the exalted Redeemer is set down at
God's right hand, in a full assurance that all his enemies shall in due
time be made his footstool, though all things are not yet put under him,
[Heb 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#008.md). 4. We must take
encouragement from the beginnings of mercy to pray and hope for the
perfecting of it ([Psa 108:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#010.md), [Psa
108:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#011).md): "Who will bring me into the
strong cities that are yet unconquered? Who will make me master of the
country of Edom, which is yet unsubdued?" The question was probably to
be debated in his privy council, or a council of war, what methods they
should take to subdue the Edomites and to reduce that country; but he
brings it into his prayers, and leaves it in God's hands: Wilt not thou,
O God? Certainly thou wilt. It is probable that he spoke with the more
assurance concerning the conquest of Edom because of the ancient oracle
concerning Jacob and Esau, that the elder should serve the younger, and
the blessing of Jacob, by which he was made Esau's lord, [Gen
27:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#037.md). 5. We must not be discouraged
in prayer, nor beaten off from our hold of God, though Providence has in
some instances frowned upon us: "Though thou hast cast us off, yet thou
wilt now go forth with our hosts, [Psa
108:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#011.md). Thou wilt comfort us again
after the time that thou hast afflicted us." Adverse events are
sometimes intended for the trial of the constancy of our faith and
prayer, which we ought to persevere in whatever difficulties we meet
with, and not to faint. 6. We must seek help from God, renouncing all
confidence in the creature ([Psa
108:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#012).md): "Lord, give us help from
trouble, prosper our designs, and defeat the designs of our enemies
against us." It is not unseasonable to talk of trouble at the same time
that we talk of triumphs, especially when it is to quicken prayer for
help from heaven; and it is a good plea, Vain is the help of man. "It is
really so, and therefore we are undone if thou do not help us; we
apprehend it to be so, and therefore depend upon thee for help and have
the more reason to expect it." 7. We must depend entirely upon the
favour and grace of God, both for strength and success in our work and
warfare, [Psa 108:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#013). (1..md) We must do
our part, but we can do nothing of ourselves; it is only through God
that we shall do valiantly. Blessed Paul will own that even he can do
nothing, nothing to purpose, but through Christ strengthening him, [Phi
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#013). (2..md) When we have acquitted
ourselves ever so well, yet we cannot speed by any merit or might of our
own; it is God himself that treads down our enemies, else we with all
our valour cannot do it. Whatever we do, whatever we gain, God must have
all the glory.
