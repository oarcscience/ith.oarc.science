### [Job Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 21:0</span></span>

This is Job's reply to Zophar's discourse, in which he complains less of
his own miseries than he had done in his former discourses (finding that
his friends were not moved by his complaints to pity him in the least),
and comes closer to the general question that was in dispute between him
and them, Whether outward prosperity, and the continuance of it, were a
mark of the true church and the true members of it, so that the ruin of
a man's prosperity is sufficient to prove him a hypocrite, though no
other evidence appear against him: this they asserted, but Job denied.
I. His preface here is designed for the moving of their affections, that
he might gain their attention ([Job
21:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#001).md). II. His discourse is designed
for the convincing of their judgments and the rectifying of their
mistakes. He owns that God does sometimes hang up a wicked man as it
were in chains, in terrorem - as a terror to others, by some visible
remarkable judgment in this life, but denies that he always does so;
nay, he maintains that commonly he does otherwise, suffering even the
worst of sinners to live all their days in prosperity and to go out of
the world without any visible mark of his wrath upon them. 1. He
describes the great prosperity of wicked people ([Job
21:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#007).md). 2. He shows their great
impiety, in which they are hardened by their prosperity ([Job
21:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#014).md). 3. He foretels their ruin
at length, but after a long reprieve ([Job
21:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#017).md). 4. He observes a very great
variety in the ways of God's providence towards men, even towards bad
men ([Job 21:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#022).md). 5. He overthrows
the ground of their severe censures of him, by showing that the
destruction of the wicked is reserved for the other world, and that they
often escape to the last in this world ([Job
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#027), to the end.md), and in this Job
was clearly in the right.

[Job 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 21:1</span></span>

Job here recommends himself, both his case and his discourse, both what
he suffered and what he said, to the compassionate consideration of his
friends. 1. That which he entreats of them is very fair, that they would
suffer him to speak ([Job 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#003).md) and
not break in upon him, as Zophar had done, in the midst of his
discourse. Losers, of all men, may have leave to speak; and, if those
that are accused and censured are not allowed to speak for themselves,
they are wronged without remedy, and have no way to come at their right.
He entreats that they would hear diligently his speech ([Job
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#002).md) as those that were willing to
understand him, and, if they were under a mistake, to have it rectified;
and that they would mark him ([Job
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#005).md), for we may as well not hear as
not heed and observe what we hear. 2. That which he urges for this is
very reasonable. (1.) They came to comfort him. "No," says he, "let this
be your consolations ([Job 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#002).md); if
you have no other comforts to administer to me, yet deny me not this; be
so kind, so just, as to give me a patient hearing, and that shall pass
for your consolations of me." Nay, they could not know how to comfort
him if they would not give him leave to open his case and tell his own
story. Or, "It will be a consolation to yourselves, in reflection, to
have dealt tenderly with your afflicted friend, and not harshly." (2.)
He would hear them speak when it came to their turn. "After I have
spoken you may go on with what you have to say, and I will not hinder
you, no, though you go on to mock me." Those that engage in controversy
must reckon upon having hard words given them, and resolve to bear
reproach patiently; for, generally, those that mock will mock on,
whatever is said to them. (3.) He hoped to convince them. "If you will
but give me a fair hearing, mock on if you can, but I believe I shall
say that which will change your note and make you pity me rather than
mock me." (4.) They were not his judges ([Job
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#004).md): "Is my complaint to man? No, if
it were I see it would be to little purpose to complain. But my
complaint is to God, and to him do I appeal. Let him be Judge between
you and me. Before him we stand upon even terms, and therefore I have
the privilege of being heard as well as you. If my complaint were to
men, my spirit would be troubled, for they would not regard me, nor
rightly understand me; but my complaint is to God, who will suffer me to
speak, though you will not." It would be sad if God should deal as
unkindly with us as our friends sometimes do. (5.) There was that in his
case which was very surprising and astonishing, and therefore both
needed and deserved their most serious consideration. It was not a
common case, but a very extraordinary one. \[1.\] He himself was amazed
at it, at the troubles God had laid upon him and the censures of his
friends concerning him ([Job 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#006).md):
"When I remember that terrible day in which I was on a sudden stripped
of all my comforts, that day in which I was stricken with sore boils, -
when I remember all the hard speeches with which you have grieved me, -
I confess I am afraid, and trembling takes hold of my flesh, especially
when I compare this with the prosperous condition of many wicked people,
and the applauses of their neighbours, with which they pass through the
world." Note, The providences of God, in the government of the world,
are sometimes very astonishing even to wise and good men, and bring them
to their wits' end. \[2.\] He would have them wonder at it ([Job
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#005).md): "Mark me, and be astonished.
Instead of expounding my troubles, you should awfully adore the
unsearchable mysteries of Providence in afflicting one thus of whom you
know no evil; you should therefore lay your hand upon your mouth,
silently wait the issue, and judge nothing before the time. God's way is
in the sea, and his path in the great waters. When we cannot account for
what he does, in suffering the wicked to prosper and the godly to be
afflicted, nor fathom the depth of those proceedings, it becomes us to
sit down and admire them. Upright men shall be astonished at this, [Job
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#008.md). Be you so."

[Job 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 21:7</span></span>

All Job's three friends, in their last discourses, had been very copious
in describing the miserable condition of a wicked man in this world. "It
is true," says Job, "remarkable judgments are sometimes brought upon
notorious sinners, but not always; for we have many instances of the
great and long prosperity of those that are openly and avowedly wicked;
though they are hardened in their wickedness by their prosperity, yet
they are still suffered to prosper."

I. He here describes their prosperity in the height, and breadth, and
length of it. "If this be true, as you say, pray tell me wherefore do
the wicked live?" [Job 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#007.md).

1\. The matter of fact is taken for granted, for we see instances of it
every day. (1.) They live, and are not suddenly cut off by the strokes
of divine vengeance. Those yet speak who have set their mouths against
the heavens. Those yet act who have stretched out their hands against
God. Not only they live (that is, they are reprieved), but they live in
prosperity, [Sa1 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#006). Nay, (2..md) They
become old; they have the honour, satisfaction, and advantage of living
long, long enough to raise their families and estates. We read of a
sinner a hundred years old, [Isa
65:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#020). But this is not all. (3..md) They
are mighty in power, are preferred to places of authority and trust, and
not only make a great figure, but bear a great sway. Vivit imo, et in
senatum venit - He not only lives, but appears in the senate. Now
wherefore is it so? Note, It is worth while to enquire into the reasons
of the outward prosperity of wicked people. It is not because God has
forsaken the earth, because he does not see, or does not hate, or cannot
punish their wickedness; but it is because the measure of their
iniquities is not full. This is the day of God's patience, and, in some
way or other, he makes use of them and their prosperity to serve his own
counsels, while it ripens them for ruin; but the chief reason is because
he will make it to appear there is another world which is the world of
retribution, and not this.

2\. The prosperity of the wicked is here described to be,

(1.) Complete and consummate. \[1.\] They are multiplied, and their
family is built up, and they have the satisfaction of seeing it ([Job
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#008).md): Their seed is established in
their sight. This is put first, as that which gives both a pleasant
enjoyment and a pleasing prospect. \[2.\] They are easy and quiet, [Job
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#009.md). Whereas Zophar had spoken of
their continual frights and terrors, Job says, Their houses are safe
both from danger and from the fear of it ([Job
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#009).md), and so far are they from the
killing wounds of God's sword or arrows that they do not feel the smart
of so much as the rod of God upon them. \[3.\] They are rich and thrive
in their estates. Of this he gives only one instance, [Job
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#010.md). Their cattle increase, and they
meet with no disappointment in them; not so much as a cow casts her
calf, and then their much must needs grow more. This is promised, [Exo
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#026.md); [Deu
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#014.md). \[4.\] They are merry and live a
jovial life ([Job 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#011.md), [Job
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#012).md): They send forth their little
ones abroad among their neighbours, like a flock, in great numbers, to
sport themselves. They have their balls and music-meetings, at which
their children dance; and dancing is fittest for children, who know not
better how to spend their time and whose innocency guards them against
the mischiefs that commonly attend it. Though the parents are not so
very youthful and frolicsome as to dance themselves, yet they take the
timbrel and harp; they pipe, and their children dance after their pipe,
and they know no grief to put their instruments out of tune or to
withhold their hearts from any joy. Some observe that this is an
instance of their vanity, as well as of their prosperity. Here is none
of that care taken of their children which Abraham took of his, to teach
them the way of the Lord, [Gen 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#019.md).
Their children do not pray, or say their catechism, but dance, and sing,
and rejoice at the sound of the organ. Sensual pleasures are all the
delights of carnal people, and as men are themselves so they breed their
children.

(2.) Continuing and constant ([Job
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#013).md): They spend their days, all
their days, in wealth, and never know what it is to want - in mirth, and
never know what sadness means; and at last, without any previous alarms
to frighten them, without any anguish or agony, in a moment they go down
to the grave, and there are no bands in their death. If there were not
another life after this, it were most desirable to die by the quickest
shortest strokes of death. Since we must go down to the grave, if that
were the furthest of our journey, we should wish to go down in a moment,
to swallow the bitter pill, and not chew it.

II\. He shows how they abuse their prosperity and are confirmed and
hardened by it in their impiety, [Job
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#014.md), [Job
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#015.md).

1\. Their gold and silver serve to steel them, to make them more
insolent, and more impudent, in their wickedness. Now he mentions this
either, (1.) To increase the difficulty. It is strange that any wicked
people should prosper thus, but especially that those should prosper who
have arrived at such a pitch of wickedness as openly to bid defiance to
God himself, and tell him to his face that they care not for him; nay,
and that their prosperity should be continued, though they bear up
themselves upon that, in their opposition to God; with that weapon they
fight against him, and yet are not disarmed. Or, (2.) To lessen the
difficulty. God suffers them to prosper; but let us not wonder at it,
for the prosperity of fools destroys them, by hardening them in sin,
[Pro 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#032.md); [Psa
73:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#007.md).

2\. See how light these prospering sinners make of God and religion, as
if because they have so much of this world they had no need to look
after another.

(1.) See how ill affected they are to God and religion; they abandon
them, and cast off the thoughts of them. \[1.\] They dread the presence
of God; they say unto him, "Depart from us; let us never be troubled
with the apprehension of our being under God's eye nor be restrained by
the fear of him." Or they bid him depart as one they do not need, nor
have any occasion to make use of. The world is the portion they have
chosen, and take up with, and think themselves happy in; while they have
that they can live without God. Justly will God say Depart ([Mat
25:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#041).md) to those who have bidden him
depart; and justly does he now take them at their word. \[2.\] They
dread the knowledge of God, and of his will, and of their duty to him:
We desire not the knowledge of thy ways. Those that are resolved not to
walk in God's ways desire not to know them, because their knowledge will
be a continual reproach to their disobedience, [Joh
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019.md).

(2.) See how they argue against God and religion ([Job
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#015).md): What is the Almighty? Strange
that ever creatures should speak so insolently, that ever reasonable
creatures should speak so absurdly and unreasonably. The two great bonds
by which we are drawn and held to religion are those of duty and
interest; now they here endeavour to break both these bonds asunder.
\[1.\] They will not believe it is their duty to be religious: What is
the Almighty, that we should serve him? Like Pharaoh ([Exo
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#002).md), Who is the Lord, that I should
obey his voice? Observe, First, How slightly they speak of God: What is
the Almighty? As if he were a mere name, a mere cipher, or one they have
nothing to do with and that has nothing to do with them. Secondly, How
hardly they speak of religion. They call it a service, and mean a hard
service. Is it not enough, they think, to keep up a fair correspondence
with the Almighty, but they must serve him, which they look upon as a
task and drudgery. Thirdly, How highly they speak of themselves: "That
we should serve him; we who are rich and mighty in power, shall we be
subject and accountable to him? No, we are lords," [Jer
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#031.md). \[2.\] They will not believe it
is their interest to be religious: What profit shall we have if we pray
unto him? All the world are for what they can get, and therefore
wisdom's merchandise is neglected, because they think there is nothing
to be got by it. It is vain to serve God, [Mal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#013.md), [Mal
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#014.md). Praying will not pay debts nor
portion children; nay, perhaps serious godliness may hinder a man's
preferment and expose him to losses; and what then? Is nothing to be
called gain but the wealth and honour of this world? If we obtain the
favour of God, and spiritual and eternal blessings, we have no reason to
complain of losing by our religion. But, if we have not profit by
prayer, it is our own fault ([Isa
58:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#003.md), [Isa
58:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#004).md), it is because we ask amiss,
[Jam 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#003.md). Religion itself is not a
vain thing; if it be so to us, we may thank ourselves for resting in the
outside of it, [Jam 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#026.md).

III\. He shows their folly herein, and utterly disclaims all concurrence
with them ([Job 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#019).md): Lo, their good
is not in their hand, that is, they did not get it without God, and
therefore they are very ungrateful to slight him thus. It was not their
might, nor the power of their hand, that got them this wealth, and
therefore they ought to remember God who gave it them. Nor can they keep
it without God, and therefore they are very unwise to lose their
interest in him and bid him to depart from them. Some give this sense of
it: "Their good is in their barns and their bags, hoarded up there; it
is not in their hand, to do good to others with it; and then what good
does it do them?" "Therefore," says Job, "the counsel of the wicked is
far from me. Far be it from me that I should be of their mind, say as
they say, do as they do, and take my measures from them. Their posterity
approve their sayings, though their way be their folly ([Psa
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#013).md); but I know better things than
to walk in their counsel."

[Job 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 21:17</span></span>

Job had largely described the prosperity of wicked people; now, in these
verses,

I. He opposes this to what his friends had maintained concerning their
certain ruin in this life. "Tell me how often do you see the candle of
the wicked put out? Do you not as often see it burnt down to the socket,
until it goes out of itself? [Job
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#017.md). How often do you see their
destruction come upon them, or God distributing sorrows in his anger
among them? Do you not as often see their mirth and prosperity
continuing to the last?" Perhaps there are as many instances of
notorious sinners ending their days in pomp as ending them in misery,
which observation is sufficient to invalidate their arguments against
Job and to show that no certain judgment can be made of men's character
by their outward condition.

II\. He reconciles this to the holiness and justice of God. Though
wicked people prosper thus all their days, yet we are not therefore to
think that God will let their wickedness always go unpunished. No, 1.
Even while they prosper thus they are as stubble and chaff before the
stormy wind, [Job 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#018.md). They are
light and worthless, and of no account either with God or with wise and
good men. They are fitted to destruction, and continually lie exposed to
it, and in the height of their pomp and power there is but a step
between them and ruin. 2. Though they spend all their days in wealth God
is laying up their iniquity for their children ([Job
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#019).md), and he will visit it upon
their posterity when they are gone. The oppressor lays up his goods for
his children, to make them gentlemen, but God lays up his iniquity for
them, to make them beggars. He keeps an exact account of the fathers'
sins, seals them up among his treasures ([Deu
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#034).md), and will justly punish the
children, while the riches, to which the curse cleaves, are found as
assets in their hands. 3. Though they prosper in this world, yet they
shall be reckoned with in another world. God rewards him according to
his deeds at last ([Job 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#019).md), though
the sentence passed against his evil works be not executed speedily.
Perhaps he may not now be made to fear the wrath to come, but he may
flatter himself with hopes that he shall have peace though he go on; but
he shall be made to feel it in the day of the revelation of the
righteous judgment of God. He shall know it ([Job
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#020).md): His eyes shall see his
destruction which he would not be persuaded to believe. They will not
see, but they shall see, [Isa 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#011.md).
The eyes that have been wilfully shut against the grace of God shall be
opened to see his destruction. He shall drink of the wrath of the
Almighty; that shall be the portion of his cup. Compare [Psa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006.md) with [Rev
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#010.md). The misery of damned sinners is
here set forth in a few words, but very terrible ones. They lie under
the wrath of an Almighty God, who, in their destruction, both shows his
wrath and makes known his power; and, if this will be his condition in
the other world, what good will his prosperity in this world do him?
What pleasure has he in his house after him? [Job
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#021.md). Our Saviour has let us know how
little pleasure the rich man in hell had in his house after him, when
the remembrance of the good things he had received in his life-time
would not cool his tongue, but added much to his misery, as did also the
sorrow he was in lest his five brethren, whom he left in his house after
him, should follow him to that place of torment, [Luk
16:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#025.md). So little will the gain of
the world profit him that has lost his soul.

III\. He resolves this difference which Providence makes between one
wicked man and another into the wisdom and sovereignty of God ([Job
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#022).md): Shall any pretend to teach God
knowledge? Dare we arraign God's proceedings or blame his conduct? Shall
we take upon us to tell God how he should govern the world, what sinner
he should spare and whom he should punish? He has both authority and
ability to judge those that are high. Angels in heaven, princes and
magistrates on earth, are accountable to God, and must receive their
doom from him. He manages them, and makes what use he pleases of them.
Shall he then be accountable to us, or receive advice from us? He is the
Judge of all the earth, and therefore no doubt he will do right ([Gen
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#025.md), [Rom
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#006).md), and those proceedings of his
providence which seem to contradict one another he can make, not only
mutually to agree, but jointly to serve his own purposes. The little
difference there is between one wicked man's dying so in pain and
misery, when both will at last meet in hell, he illustrates by the
little difference there is between one man's dying suddenly and
another's dying slowly, when they will both meet shortly in the grave.
So vast is the disproportion between time and eternity that, if hell be
the lot of every sinner at last, it makes little difference if one goes
singing thither and another sighing. See,

1\. How various the circumstances of people's dying are. There is one
way into the world, we say, but many out; yet, as some are born by quick
and easy labour, others by that which is hard and lingering, so dying is
to some much more terrible than to others; and, since the death of the
body is the birth of the soul into another world, death-bed agonies may
not unfitly be compared to child-bed throes. Observe the difference.
(1.) One dies suddenly, in his full strength, not weakened by age or
sickness ([Job 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#023).md), being wholly at
ease and quiet, under no apprehension at all of the approach of death,
nor in any fear of it; but, on the contrary, because his breasts are
full of milk and his bones moistened with marrow ([Job
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#024).md), that is, he is healthful and
vigorous, and of a good constitution (like a milch cow that is fat and
in good liking), he counts upon nothing but to live many years in mirth
and pleasure. Thus fair does he bid for life, and yet he is cut off in a
moment by the stroke of death. Note, It is a common thing for persons to
be taken away by death when they are in their full strength, in the
highest degree of health, when they least expect death, and think
themselves best armed against it, and are ready not only to set death at
a distance, but to set it at defiance. Let us therefore never be secure;
for we have known many well and dead in the same week, the same day, the
same hour, nay, perhaps, the same minute. Let us therefore be always
ready. (2.) Another dies slowly, and with a great deal of previous pain
and misery ([Job 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#025).md), in the
betterness of his soul, such as poor Job was himself now in, and never
eats with pleasure, has no appetite to his food nor any relish of it,
through sickness, or age, or sorrow of mind. What great reason have
those to be thankful that are in health and always eat with pleasure!
And what little reason have those to complain who sometimes do not eat
thus, when they hear of many that never do!

2\. How undiscernible this difference is in the grave. As rich and poor,
so healthful and unhealthful, meet there ([Job
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#026).md): They shall lie down alike in
the dust, and the worms shall cover them, and feed sweetly on them.
Thus, if one wicked man die in a palace and another in a dungeon, they
will meet in the congregation of the dead and damned, and the worm that
dies not, and the fire that is not quenched, will be the same to them,
which makes those differences inconsiderable and not worth perplexing
ourselves about.

[Job 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 21:27</span></span>

In these verses,

I. Job opposes the opinion of his friends, which he saw they still
adhered to, that the wicked are sure to fall into such visible and
remarkable ruin as Job had now fallen into, and none but the wicked,
upon which principle they condemned Job as a wicked man. "I know your
thoughts," says Job ([Job 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#027).md); "I
know you will not agree with me; for your judgments are tinctured and
biassed by your piques and prejudices against me, and the devices which
you wrongfully imagine against my comfort and honour: and how can such
men be convinced?" Job's friends were ready to say, in answer to his
discourse concerning the prosperity of the wicked, "Where is the house
of the prince? [Job 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#028.md). Where is
Job's house, or the house of his eldest son, in which his children were
feasting? Enquire into the circumstances of Job's house and family, and
then ask, Where are the dwelling-places of the wicked? and compare them
together, and you will soon see that Job's house is in the same
predicament with the houses of tyrants and oppressors, and may therefore
conclude that doubtless he was such a one."

II\. He lays down his own judgment to the contrary, and, for proof of
it, appeals to the sentiments and observations of all mankind. So
confident is he that he is in the right that he is willing to refer the
cause to the next man that comes by ([Job
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#029).md): "Have you not asked those that
go by the way - any indifferent person, any that will answer you? I say
not, as Eliphaz ([Job 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#001).md), to which
of the saints, but to which of the children of men will you turn? Turn
to which you will, and you will find them all of my mind, that the
punishment of sinners is designed more for the other world than for
this, according to the prophecy of Enoch, the seventh from Adam, [Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014.md). Do you not know the tokens of
this truth, which all that have made any observations upon the
providences of God concerning mankind in this world can furnish you
with?" Now,

1\. What is it that Job here asserts? Two things: - (1.) That impenitent
sinners will certainly be punished in the other world, and, usually,
their punishment is put off until then. (2.) That therefore we are not
to think it strange if they prosper greatly in this world and fall under
no visible token of God's wrath. Therefore they are spared now, because
they are to be punished then; therefore the workers of iniquity
flourish, that they may be destroyed for ever, [Psa
92:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#007.md). The sinner is here supposed,
\[1.\] To live in a great deal of power, so as to be not only the terror
of the mighty in the land of the living ([Eze
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#027).md), but the terror of the wise and
good too, whom he keeps in such awe that none dares declare his way to
his face, [Job 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#031.md). None will take
the liberty to reprove him, to tell him of the wickedness of his way,
and what will be in the end thereof; so that he sins securely, and is
not made to know either shame or fear. The prosperity of fools destroys
them, by setting them (in their own conceit) above reproofs, by which
they might be brought to that repentance which alone will prevent their
ruin. Those are marked for destruction that are let alone in sin, [Hos
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#017.md). And, if none dares declare his
way to his face, much less dare any repay him what he has done and make
him refund what he has obtained by injustice. He is one of those great
flies which break through the cobwebs of the law, that hold only the
little ones. This emboldens sinners in their sinful ways that they can
brow-beat justice and make it afraid to meddle with them. But there is a
day coming when those shall be told of their faults who now would not
bear to hear of them, those shall have their sins set in order before
them, and their way declared to their face, to their everlasting
confusion, who would not have it done here, to their conviction, and
those who would not repay the wrongs they had done shall have them
repaid to them. \[2.\] To die, and be buried in a great deal of pomp and
magnificence, [Job 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#032.md), [Job
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#033.md). There is no remedy; he must
die; that is the lot of all men; but every thing you can think of shall
be done to take off the reproach of death. First, He shall have a
splendid funeral - a poor thing for any man to be proud of the prospect
of; yet with some it passes for a mighty thing. Well, he shall be
brought to the grave in state, surrounded with all the honours of the
heralds' office and all the respect his friends can then pay to his
remains. The rich man died, and was buried, but no mention is made of
the poor man's burial, [Luk 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#022.md).
Secondly, He shall have a stately monument erected over him. He shall
remain in the tomb with a Hic jacet - Here lies, over him, and a large
encomium. Perhaps it is meant of the embalming of his body to preserve
it, which was a piece of honour anciently done by the Egyptians to their
great men. He shall watch in the tomb (so the word is), shall abide
solitary and quiet there, as a watchman in his tower. Thirdly, The clods
of the valley shall be sweet to him; there shall be as much done as can
be with rich odours to take off the noisomeness of the grave, as by
lamps to set aside the darkness of it, which perhaps was referred to in
the foregoing phrase of watching in the tomb. But it is all a jest; what
is the light, or what the perfume, to a man that is dead? Fourthly, It
shall be alleged, for the lessening of the disgrace of death, that it is
the common lot: He has only yielded to fate, and every man shall draw
after him, as there are innumerable before him. Note, Death is the way
of all the earth: when we are to cross that darksome valley we must
consider, 1. That there are innumerable before us; it is a tracked road,
which may help to take off the terror of it. To die is ire ad plures -
to go to the great majority. 2. That every man shall draw after us. As
there is a plain track before, so there is a long train behind; we are
neither the first nor the last that pass through that dark entry. Every
one must go in his own order, the order appointed of God.

2\. From all this Job infers the impertinency of their discourses, [Job
21:34](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#034). (1..md) Their foundation is
rotten, and they went upon a wrong hypothesis: "In your answers there
remains falsehood; what you have said stands not only unproved but
disproved, and lies under such an imputation of falsehood as you cannot
clear it from." (2.) Their building was therefore weak and tottering:
"You comfort me in vain. All you have said gives me no relief; you tell
me that I shall prosper again if I turn to God, but you go upon this
presumption, that piety shall certainly be crowned with prosperity,
which is false; and therefore how can your inference from it yield me
any comfort?" Note, Where there is not truth there is little comfort to
be expected.
