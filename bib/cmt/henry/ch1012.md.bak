### [1 Chronicles Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 12:0</span></span>

What the mighty men did towards making David king we read in the
foregoing chapter. Here we are told what the many did towards it. It was
not all at once, but gradually, that David ascended the throne. His
kingdom was to last; and therefore, like fruits that keep longest, it
ripened slowly. After he had long waited for the vacancy of the throne,
it was at two steps and those above seven years distant, that he
ascended it. Now we are here told, I. What help came in to him to
Ziklag, to make him king of Judah (v. 1-22). II. What help came in to
him in Hebron, to make him king over all Israel, above seven years after
(v. 23-40).

[1 Chronicles 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 12:1</span></span>

We have here an account of those that appeared and acted as David's
friends, upon the death of Saul, to bring about the revolution. All the
forces he had, while he was persecuted, was but 600 men, who served for
his guards; but, when the time had come that he must begin to act
offensively, Providence brought in more to his assistance. Even while he
kept himself close, because of Saul ([Ch1
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#001).md), while he did not appear, to
invite or encourage his friends and well-wishers to come in to him (not
foreseeing that the death of Saul was so near), God was inclining and
preparing them to come over to him with seasonable succours. Those that
trust God to do his work for them in his own way and time shall find his
providence outdoing all their forecast and contrivance. The war was
God's, and he found out helpers of the war, whose forwardness to act for
the man God designed for the government is here recorded to their
honour.

I. Some, even of Saul's brethren, of the tribe of Benjamin, and a-kin to
him, came over to David, [Ch1 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#002.md).
What moved them to it we are not told. Probably a generous indignation
at the base treatment which Saul, one of their tribe, gave him, animated
them to appear the more vigorously for him, that the guilt and reproach
of it might not lie upon them. These Benjamites are described to be men
of great dexterity, that were trained up in shooting and slinging, and
used both hands alike - ingenious active men; a few of these might do
David a great deal of service. Several of the leading men of them are
here named. See [Jdg 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#016.md).

II\. Some of the tribe of Gad, though seated on the other side Jordan,
had such a conviction of David's title to the government, and fitness
for it, that they separated themselves from their brethren (a laudable
separation it was) to go to David, though he was in the hold in the
wilderness ([Ch1 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#008).md), probably some
of his strong holds in the wilderness of Engedi. They were but few,
eleven in all, here named, but they added much to David's strength.
Those that had hitherto come in to his assistance were most of them men
of broken fortunes, distressed, discontented, and soldiers of fortune,
that came to him rather for protection than to do him any service, [Sa1
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#002.md). But these Gadites were brave
men, men of war, and fit for the battle, [Ch1
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#008.md). For, 1. They were able-bodied
men, men of incredible swiftness, not to fly from, but to fly upon, the
enemy, and to pursue the scattered forces. In this they were as swift as
the roes upon the mountains, so that no man could escape from them; and
yet they had faces like the faces of lions, so that no man could
out-fight them. 2. They were disciplined men, trained up to military
exercises; they could handle shield and buckler, use both offensive and
defensive weapons. 3. They were officers of the militia in their own
tribe ([Ch1 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#014).md), so that though
they did not bring soldiers with them they had them at command,
hundreds, thousands. 4. They were daring men, that could break through
the greatest difficulties. Upon some expedition or other, perhaps this
to David, they swam over the Jordan, when it overflowed all its banks,
[Ch1 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#015.md). Those are fit to be
employed in the cause of God that can venture thus in a dependence upon
the divine protection. 5. They were men that would go through with the
business they engaged in. What enemies those were that they met with in
the valleys, when they had passed Jordan, does not appear; but they put
them to flight with their lion-like faces, and pursued them with
matchless fury, both towards the east and towards the west; which way
soever they turned, they followed their blow, and did not do their work
by halves.

III\. Some of Judah and Benjamin came to him, [Ch1
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#016.md). Their leader was Amasai,
whether the same with that Amasa that afterwards sided with Absalom
([Sa2 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#025).md) or no does not appear.
Now here we have,

1\. David's prudent treaty with them, [Ch1
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#017.md). He was surprised to see them,
and could not but conceive some jealousy of the intentions of their
coming, having been so often in danger by the treachery of the men of
Ziph and the men of Keilah, who yet were all men of Judah. He might well
be timorous whose life was so much struck at; he might well be
suspicious who had been deceived in so many that he said, in his haste,
All men are liars. No marvel that he meets these men of Judah with
caution. Observe,

(1.) How he puts the matter to themselves, how fairly he deals with
them. As they are, they shall find him; so shall all that deal with the
Son of David. \[1.\] If they be faithful and honourable, he will be
their rewarder: "If you have come peaceably unto me, to help me, though
you have come late and have left me exposed a great while, though you
bring no great strength with you to turn the scale for me, yet I will
thankfully accept your good-will, and my heart shall be knit unto you; I
will love you and honour you, and do you all the kindness I can."
Affection, respect, and service, that are cordial and sincere, will find
favour with a good man, as they do with a good God, though clogged with
infirmities, and turning to no great account. But, \[2.\] If they be
false, and come to betray him into the hands of Saul, under colour of
friendship, he leaves them to God to be their avenger, as he is, and
will be, of every thing that is treacherous and perfidious. Never was
man more violently run upon, and run down, than David was (except the
Son of David himself), and yet he had the testimony of his conscience
that there was no wrong in his hands. He meant no harm to any man, which
was his rejoicing in the day of evil, and enabled him, when he feared
treachery, to commit his cause to him that judges righteously. He will
not be judge in his own cause, though a wise man, nor avenge himself,
though a man of valour; but let the righteous God, who hath said,
Vengeance is mine, do both. The God of our fathers look thereon and
rebuke it.

(2.) In this appeal observe, \[1.\] He calls God the God of our fathers,
both his fathers and theirs. Thus he reminded them not to deal ill with
him; for they were both descendants from the same patriarchs, and both
dependents on the same God. Thus he encouraged himself to believe that
God would right him if he should be abused; for he was the God of his
fathers and therefore a blessing was entailed on him, and a God to all
Israel and therefore not only a Judge to all the earth, but particularly
concerned in determining controversies between contesting Israelites.
\[2.\] He does not imprecate any fearful judgement upon them, though
they should deal treacherously, but very modestly refers his cause to
the divine wisdom and justice: The Lord look thereon, and judge as he
sees (for he sees men's hearts), and rebuke it. It becomes those that
appeal to God to express themselves with great temper and moderation;
for the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God.

2\. Their hearty closure with him, [Ch1
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#018.md). Amasai was their spokesman, on
whom the Spirit of the Lord came, not a spirit of prophecy, but a spirit
of wisdom and resolution, according to the occasion, putting words into
his mouth, unpremeditated, which were proper both to give David
satisfaction and to animate those that accompanied him. Nothing could be
said finer, more lively, or more pertinent to the occasion. For himself
and all his associates, (1.) He professed a very cordial adherence to
David, and his interest, against all that opposed him, and a resolution
to stand by him with the hazard of all that was dear to him: Thine are
we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse. In calling him son of
Jesse they reminded themselves that he was lineally descended from
Nahshon and Salmon, who in their days were princes of the tribe of
Judah. Saul called him so in disdain ([Sa1
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#027.md); [Sa1
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#007).md), but they looked upon it as his
honour. They were convinced that God was on his side; and therefore,
Thine are we, David, and on thy side. It is good, if we must side, to
side with those that side with God and have God with them. (2.) He
wished prosperity to David and his cause, not drinking a health, but
praying for peace to him and all his friends and well-wishers: "Peace,
peace, be unto thee, all the good thy heart desires, and peace be to thy
helpers, among whom we desire to be reckoned, that peace may be on us."
(3.) He assured him of help from heaven: "For thy God helpeth thee;
therefore we wish peace may be, and therefore we doubt not but peace
shall be, to thee and thy helpers. God is thy God, and those that have
him for their God no doubt have him for their helper in every time of
need and danger." From these expressions of Amasai we may take
instruction how to testify our affection and allegiance to the Lord
Jesus. His we must be without reservation or power of revocation. On his
side we must be forward to appear and act. To his interest we must be
hearty well-wishers: "Hosanna! prosperity to his gospel and kingdom;"
for his God helpeth him, and will till he shall have put down all
opposing rule, principality, and power.

3\. David's cheerful acceptance of them into his interest and
friendship. Charity and honour teach us to let fall our jealousies as
soon as satisfaction is given us: David received them, and preferred
them to be captains of the band.

IV\. Some of Manasseh likewise joined with him, v. 19. Providence gave
them a fair opportunity to do so when he and his men marched through
their country upon this occasion. Achish took David with him when he
went out to fight with Saul; but the lords of the Philistines obliged
him to withdraw. We have the story, [Sa1
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#004.md), etc. In his return some great
men of Manasseh, who had no heart to join with Saul against the
Philistines struck in with David, and very seasonably, to help him
against the band of Amelekites who plundered Ziklag; they were not many,
but they were all mighty men and did David good service upon that
occasion, 1 Sa. 30. See how Providence provides. David's interest grew
strangely just when he had occasion to make use of it, [Ch1
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#022.md). Auxiliary forces flocked in
daily, till he had a great host. When the promise comes to the birth,
leave it to God to find strength to bring forth.

[1 Chronicles 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 12:23</span></span>

We have here an account of those who were active in perfecting the
settlement of David upon the throne, after the death of Ishbosheth. We
read ([Ch1 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#001.md), and before [Sa2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001).md) that all the tribes of Israel
came, either themselves or by their representatives, to Hebron, to make
David king; now here we have an account of the quota which every tribe
brought in ready armed to the war, in case there should be any
opposition, [Ch1 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#023.md). We may observe
here,

I. That those tribes that lived nearest brought the fewest - Judah but
6800 ([Ch1 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#024).md), Simeon but 7100
([Ch1 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#025).md); whereas Zebulun, that
lay remote, brought 50,000, Asher 40,000, and the two tribes and a half
on the other side Jordan 120,000. Not as if the next adjacent tribes
were cold in the cause; but they showed as much of their prudence in
bringing few, since all the rest lay so near within call, as the others
did of their zeal in bringing so many. The men of Judah had enough to do
to entertain those that came from afar.

II\. The Levites themselves, and the priests (called here the
Aaronites), appeared very hearty in this cause, and were ready, if there
were occasion, to fight for David, as well as pray for him, because they
knew he was called of God to the government, [Ch1
12:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#026.md).

III\. Even some of the kindred of Saul came over to David ([Ch1
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#029).md), not so many as of the other
tribes, because a foolish affection for their own tribe, and a jealousy
for the honour of it, kept many of them long in the sinking interest of
Saul's family. Kindred should never over-rule conscience. Call no man
Father to this extent, but God only.

IV\. It is said of most of these that they were mighty men of valour
([Ch1 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#025.md), [Ch1
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#028.md), [Ch1
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#030).md), of others that they were
expert in war ([Ch1 12:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#035.md), [Ch1
12:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#036).md), and of them all that they
could keep rank, [Ch1 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#038.md). They had
a great deal of martial fire, and yet were governable and subject to the
rules of order - warm hearts but cool heads.

V. Some were so considerate as to bring with them arms, and all
instruments for war ([Ch1 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#024.md), [Ch1
12:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#033.md), [Ch1
12:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#037).md), for how could they think that
David should be able to furnish them?

VI\. The men of Issachar were the fewest af all, only 200, and yet as
serviceable to David's interest as those that brought in the greatest
numbers, these few being in effect the whole tribe. For, 1. They were
men of great skill above any of their neighbours, men that had
understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do. They
understood the natural times, could discern the face of the sky, were
weather-wise, could advise their neighbours in the proper times for
ploughing, sowing reaping, etc. Or the ceremonial times, the times
appointed for the solemn feasts; therefore they are said to call the
people to the mountain ([Deu 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#019).md),
for almanacs were not then so common as now. Or, rather, the political
times; they understood public affairs, the temper of the nation, and the
tendencies of the present events. It is the periphrasis of statesmen
that they know the times, Esth. 1. 13. Those of that tribe were greatly
intent on public affairs, had good intelligence from abroad and made a
good use of it. They knew what Israel ought to do: from their
observation and experience they learned both their own and others' duty
and interest. In this critical juncture they knew Israel ought to make
David king. It was not only expedient, but necessary; the present
posture of affairs called for it. The men of Issachar dealt mostly in
country business, and did not much intermeddle in public affairs, which
gave them an opportunity of observing others and conversing with
themselves. A stander-by sees sometimes more than a gamester. 2. They
were men of great interests; for all their brethren were at their
commandment. The commonality of that tribe having bowed their shoulder
to bear ([Gen 49:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#015).md), the great men
had them at their beck. Hence we read of the princes of Issachar, [Jdg
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#015.md). They knew how to rule, and the
rest knew how to obey. It is happy indeed when those that should lead
are intelligent and judicious, and those who are to follow are modest
and obsequious.

VII\. It is said of them all that they engaged in this enterprise with a
perfect heart ([Ch1 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#038).md), and
particularly of the men of Zebulun that they were not of double heart,
[Ch1 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#033.md). They were, in this matter,
Israelites indeed, in whom was no guile. And this was their perfection,
that they were of one heart, [Ch1
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#038.md). None had any separate
interests, but all for the public good.

VIII\. The men of Judah, and others of the adjacent tribes, prepared for
the victualling of their respective camps when they came to Hebron, [Ch1
12:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#039.md), [Ch1
12:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#040.md). Those that were at the least
pains in travelling to this convention, or congress of states, thought
themselves obliged to be at so much the more charge in entertaining the
rest, that there might be something of an equality. A noble feast was
made (was made for laughter, [Ecc
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#019).md) upon this occasion, for there
was joy in Israel, [Ch1 12:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#040.md). And
good reason; for when the righteous bear rule the city rejoices. Thus,
when the throne of Christ is set up in a soul, there is, or ought to be,
great joy in that soul: and provision is made for the feasting of it,
not as here for two or three days, but for the whole life, nay, for
eternity.
