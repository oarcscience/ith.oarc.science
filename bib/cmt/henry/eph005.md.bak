### [Ephesians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001.md)

[Ephesians](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eph 5:0</span></span>

We had several important exhortations in the close of the foregoing
chapter, and they are continued in this: particularly, I. We have here
an exhortation to mutual love and charity ([Eph
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001.md), [Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002).md). II. Against all manner of
uncleanness, with proper arguments and remedies proposed against such
sins: and some further cautions are added, and other duties recommended
(v. 3-20). III. The apostle directs to the conscientious discharge of
relative duties, from [Eph 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#021.md),
throughout this, and in the beginning of the next chapter.

[Ephesians 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eph 5:1</span></span>

Here we have the exhortation to mutual love, or to Christian charity.
The apostle had been insisting on this in the former chapter, and
particularly in the last verses of it, to which the particle therefore
refers, and connects what he had said there with what is contained in
these verses, thus: "Because God, for Christ's sake, has forgiven you,
therefore be you followers of God, or imitators of him;" for so the word
signifies. Pious persons should imitate the God whom they worship, as
far as he has revealed himself as imitable by them. They must conform
themselves to his example, and have his image renewed upon them. This
puts a great honour upon practical religion, that it is the imitating of
God. We must be holy as God is holy, merciful as he is merciful, perfect
as he is perfect. But there is no one attribute of God more recommended
to our imitation than that of his goodness. Be you imitators of God, or
resemble him, in every grace, and especially in his love, and in his
pardoning goodness. God is love; and those that dwell in love dwell in
God and God in them. Thus he has proclaimed his name, Gracious and
merciful, and abundant in goodness. As dear children, as children (who
are wont to be greatly beloved by their parents) usually resemble them
in the lineaments and features of their faces, and in the dispositions
and qualities of their minds; or as becomes the children of God, who are
beloved and cherished by their heavenly Father. Children are obliged to
imitate their parents in what is good, especially when dearly beloved by
them. The character that we bear of God's children obliges us to
resemble him, especially in his love and goodness, in his mercy and
readiness to forgive. And those only are God's dear children who imitate
him in these. It follows, And walk in love, [Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002.md). This godlike grace should conduct
and influence our whole conversation, which is meant by walking in it.
It should be the principle from which we act; it should direct the ends
at which we aim. We should be more careful to give proof of the
sincerity of our love one to another. As Christ also hath loved us. Here
the apostle directs us to the example of Christ, whom Christians are
obliged to imitate, and in whom we have an instance of the most free and
generous love that ever was, that great love wherewith he hath loved us.
We are all joint sharers in that love, and partakers of the comfort of
it, and therefore should love one another, Christ having loved us all
and given such proof of his love to us; for he hath given himself for
us. The apostle designedly enlarges on the subject; for what can yield
us more delightful matter for contemplation than this? Christ gave
himself to die for us; and the death of Christ was the great sacrifice
of atonement: An offering and a sacrifice to God; or an offering, even a
sacrifice - a propitiatory sacrifice, to expiate our guilt, which had
been prefigured in the legal oblations and sacrifices; and this for a
sweet-smelling savour. Some observe that the sin-offerings were never
said to be of a sweet-smelling savour; but this is said of the Lamb of
God, which taketh away the sin of the world. As he offered himself with
a design to be accepted of God, so God did accept, was pleased with, and
appeased by, that sacrifice. Note, As the sacrifice of Christ was
efficacious with God, so his example should be prevailing with us, and
we should carefully copy after it.

[Ephesians 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eph 5:3</span></span>

These verses contain a caution against all manner of uncleanness, with
proper remedies and arguments proposed: some further cautions are added,
and other duties recommended. Filthy lusts must be suppressed, in order
to the supporting of holy love. Walk in love, and shun fornication and
all uncleanness. Fornication is folly committed between unmarried
persons. All uncleanness includes all other sorts of filthy lusts, which
were too common among the Gentiles. Or covetousness, which being thus
connected, and mentioned as a thing which should not be once named, some
understand it, in the chaste style of the scripture, of unnatural lust;
while others take it in the more common sense, for an immoderate desire
of gain or an insatiable love of riches, which is spiritual adultery;
for by this the soul, which was espoused to God, goes astray from him,
and embraces the bosom of a stranger, and therefore carnal worldlings
are called adulterers: You adulterers and adulteresses, know you not
that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Now these sins must
be dreaded and detested in the highest degree: Let it not be once named
among you, never in a way of approbation nor without abhorrence, as
becometh saints, holy persons, who are separated from the world, and
dedicated unto God. The apostle not only cautions against the gross acts
of sin, but against what some may be apt to make light of, and think to
be excusable. Neither filthiness ([Eph
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#004).md), by which may be understood all
wanton and unseemly gestures and behaviour; nor foolish talking, obscene
and lewd discourse, or, more generally, such vain discourse as betrays
much folly and indiscretion, and is far from edifying the hearers; nor
jesting. The Greek word eutrapelia is the same which Aristotle, in his
Ethics, makes a virtue: pleasantness of conversation. And there is no
doubt an innocent and inoffensive jesting, which we cannot suppose the
apostle here forbids. Some understand him of such scurrilous and abusive
reflections as tend to expose others and to make them appear ridiculous.
This is bad enough: but the context seems to restrain it to such
pleasantry of discourse as is filthy and obscene, which he may also
design by that corrupt, or putrid and rotten, communication that he
speaks of, [Eph 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#029.md). Of these things
he says, They are not convenient. Indeed there is more than
inconvenience, even a great deal of mischief, in them. They are so far
from being profitable that they pollute and poison the hearers. But the
meaning is, Those things do not become Christians, and are very
unsuitable to their profession and character. Christians are allowed to
be cheerful and pleasant; but they must be merry and wise. The apostle
adds, But rather giving of thanks: so far let the Christian's way of
mirth be from that of obscene and profane wit, that he may delight his
mind, and make himself cheerful, by a grateful remembrance of God's
goodness and mercy to him, and by blessing and praising him on account
of these. Note, 1. We should take all occasions to render thanksgivings
and praises to God for his kindness and favours to us. 2. A reflection
on the grace and goodness of God to us, with a design to excite our
thankfulness to him, is proper to refresh and delight the Christian's
mind, and to make him cheerful. Dr. Hammond thinks that eucharistia may
signify gracious, pious, religious discourse in general, by way of
opposition to what the apostle condemns. Our cheerfulness, instead of
breaking out into what is vain and sinful, and a profanation of God's
name, should express itself as becomes Christians, and in what may tend
to his glory. If men abounded more in good and pious expressions, they
would not be so apt to utter ill and unbecoming words; for shall
blessing and cursing, lewdness and thanksgivings, proceed out of the
same mouth?

I. To fortify us against the sins of uncleanness, etc., the apostle
urges several arguments, and prescribes several remedies, in what
follows,

1\. He urges several arguments, As, (1.) Consider that these are sins
which shut persons out of heaven: For this you know, etc., [Eph
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005.md). They knew it, being informed of
it by the Christian religion. By a covetous man some understand a lewd
lascivious libertine, who indulges himself in those vile lusts which
were accounted the certain marks of a heathen and an idolater. Others
understand it in the common acceptation of the word; and such a man is
an idolater because there is spiritual idolatry in the love of this
world. As the epicure makes a god of his belly, so the covetous man
makes a god of his money, sets those affectations upon it, and places
that hope, confidence, and delight, in worldly good, which should be
reserved for God only. He serves mammon instead of God. Of these persons
it is said that they have no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of
God; that is, the kingdom of Christ, who is God, or the kingdom which is
God's by nature, and Christ's as he is Mediator, the kingdom which
Christ has purchased and which God bestows. Heaven is here described as
a kingdom (as frequently elsewhere) with respect to its eminency and
glory, its fulness and sufficiency, etc. In this kingdom the saints and
servants of God have an inheritance; for it is the inheritance of the
saints in light. But those who are impenitent, and allow themselves
either in the lusts of the flesh or the love of the world, are not
Christians indeed, and so belong not to the kingdom of grace, nor shall
they ever come to the kingdom of glory. Let us then be excited to be on
our guard against those sins which would exclude and shut us out of
heaven. (2.) These sins bring the wrath of God upon those who are guilty
of them: "Let no man deceive you with vain words, etc., [Eph
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#006.md). Let none flatter you, as though
such things were tolerable and to be allowed of in Christians, or as
though they were not very provoking and offensive unto God, or as though
you might indulge yourselves in them and yet escape with impunity. These
are vain words." Observe, Those who flatter themselves and others with
hopes of impunity in sin do but put a cheat upon themselves and others.
Thus Satan deceived our first parents with vain words when he said to
them, You shall not surely die. They are vain words indeed; for those
who trust to them will find themselves wretchedly imposed upon, for
because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of
disobedience. By children of disobedience may be meant the Gentiles, who
disbelieved, and refused to comply with, and to submit themselves to,
the gospel: or, more generally, all obstinate sinners, who will not be
reclaimed, but are given over to disobedience. Disobedience is the very
malignity of sin. And it is by a usual Hebraism that such sinners are
called children of disobedience; and such indeed they are from their
childhood, going astray as soon as they are born. The wrath of God comes
upon such because of their sins; sometimes in this world, but more
especially in the next. And dare we make light of that which will lay us
under the wrath of God? O no. Be not you therefore partakers with them,
[Eph 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#007.md). "Do not partake with them in
their sins, that you may not share in their punishment." We partake with
other men in their sins, not only when we live in the same sinful manner
that they do, and consent and comply with their temptations and
solicitations to sin, but when we encourage them in their sins, prompt
them to sin, and do not prevent and hinder them, as far as it may be in
our power to do so. (3.) Consider what obligations Christians are under
to live at another rate than such sinners do: For you were sometimes
darkness, but now, etc., [Eph 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008.md). The
meaning is, "Such courses are very unsuitable to your present condition;
for, whereas in your Gentile and your unregenerate state you were
darkness, you have now undergone a great change." The apostle calls
their former condition darkness in the abstract, to express the great
darkness they were in. They lived wicked and profane lives, being
destitute of the light of instruction without and of the illumination
and grace of the blessed Spirit within. Note, A state of sin is a state
of darkness. Sinners, like men in the dark, are going they know not
whither, and doing they know not what. But the grace of God had produced
a mighty change in their souls: Now are you light in the Lord, savingly
enlightened by the word and the Spirit of God. Now, upon your believing
in Christ, and your receiving the gospel. Walk as children of light.
Children of light, according to the Hebrew dialect, are those who are in
a state of light, endued with knowledge and holiness. "Now, being such,
let your conversation be suitable to your condition and privileges, and
accordingly live up to the obligation you are under by that knowledge
and those advantages you enjoy - Proving what is acceptable unto the
Lord ([Eph 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#010).md), examining and
searching diligently what God has revealed to be his will, and making it
appear that you approve it by conforming yourselves to it." Observe, We
must not only dread and avoid that which is displeasing to God, but
enquire and consider what will be acceptable to him, searching the
scriptures with this view, thus keeping at the greatest distance from
these sins.

2\. The apostle prescribes some remedies against them. As, (1.) If we
would not be entangled by the lusts of the flesh, we must bring forth
the fruits of the Spirit, [Eph 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#009.md).
This is expected from the children of light, that, being illuminated,
they be also sanctified by the Spirit, and thereupon bring forth his
fruit, which is in all goodness, an inclination to do good and to show
mercy, and righteousness, which signifies justice in our dealings. Thus
they are taken more strictly; but, more generally, all religion is
goodness and righteousness. And in and with these must be truth, or
sincerity and uprightness of heart. (2.) We must have no fellowship with
sin nor sinners, [Eph 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011.md). Sinful
works are works of darkness: they come from the darkness of ignorance,
they seek the darkness of concealment, and they lead to the darkness of
hell. These works of darkness are unfruitful works; there is nothing got
by them in the long run, whatever profit is pretended by sin, it will by
no means balance the loss; for it issues in the utter ruin and
destruction of the impenitent sinner. We must therefore have no
fellowship with these unfruitful works; as we must not practice them
ourselves, so we must not countenance others in the practice of them.
There are many ways of our being accessory to the sins of others, by
commendation, counsel, consent, or concealment. And, if we share with
others in their sin, we must expect to share with them in their plagues.
Nay, if we thus have fellowship with them, we shall be in the utmost
danger of acting as they do ere long. But, rather than have fellowship
with them, we must reprove them, implying that if we do not reprove the
sins of others we have fellowship with them. We must prudently and in
our places witness against the sins of others, and endeavour to convince
them of their sinfulness, when we can do it seasonably and pertinently,
in our words; but especially by the holiness of our lives, and a
religious conversation. Reprove their sins by abounding in the contrary
duties. One reason given is, For it is a shame even to speak of those
things, etc., [Eph 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#012.md). They are so
filthy and abominable that it is a shame to mention them, except in a
way of reproof, much more must it be a shame to have any fellowship with
them. The things which are done of them in secret. The apostle seems to
speak here of the Gentile idolaters, and of their horrid mysteries,
which abounded with detestable wickedness, and which none were permitted
to divulge upon pain of death. Observe, A good man is ashamed to speak
that which many wicked people are not ashamed to act; but, as far as
their wickedness appears, it should be reproved by good men. There
follows another reason for such reproof: But all things that are
reproved are made manifest by the light, [Eph
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#013.md). The meaning of this passage may
be this: "All those unfruitful works of darkness which you are called
upon to reprove are laid open, and made to appear in their proper
colours to the sinners themselves, by the light of doctrine or of God's
word in your mouths, as faithful reprovers, or by that instructive light
which is diffused by the holiness of your lives and by your exemplary
walk." Observe, The light of God's word, and the exemplification of it
in a Christian conversation, are proper means to convince sinners of
their sin and wickedness. It follows, For whatsoever doth make manifest
is light; that is, it is the light that discovers what was concealed
before in darkness; and accordingly it becomes those who are children of
light, who are light in the Lord, to discover to others their sins, and
to endeavour to convince them of the evil and danger of them, thus
shining as lights in the world. The apostle further urges this duty from
the example of God or Christ: Wherefore he saith, etc. ([Eph
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014).md); as if he had said, "In doing
this, you will copy after the great God, who has set himself to awaken
sinners from their sleep, and to raise them from the death of sin, that
they might receive light from Christ." He saith. The Lord is constantly
saying in his word what is more particularly expressed in [Isa
60:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001.md). Or, Christ, by his ministers,
who preach the everlasting gospel, is continually calling upon sinners
to this effect: Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead. The
same thing in the main is designed by these different expressions; and
they serve to remind us of the great stupidity and the wretched security
of sinners, how insensible they are of their danger, and how unapt they
naturally are to spiritual motions, sensations, and actions. When God
calls upon them to awake, and to arise, his meaning is that they would
break off their sins by repentance, and enter on a course of holy
obedience, and he encourages them to essay and do their utmost that way,
by that gracious promise, And Christ shall give thee light; or Christ
shall enlighten thee, or shall shine upon thee. "He shall bring thee
into a state of knowledge, holiness, and comfort, assisting thee with
his grace, and refreshing thy mind with joy and peace here and rewarding
thee with eternal glory at length." Observe, When we are endeavouring to
convince sinners, and to reform them from their sins, we are imitating
God and Christ in that which is their great design throughout the
gospel. Some indeed understand this as a call to sinners and to saints:
to sinners to repent and turn; to saints to stir up themselves to their
duty. The former must arise from their spiritual death; and the latter
must awake from their spiritual deadness. (3.) Another remedy against
sin is circumspection, care, or caution ([Eph
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#015).md): See then, etc. This may be
understood either with respect to what immediately precedes, "If you are
to reprove others for their sins, and would be faithful to your duty in
this particular, you must look well to yourselves, and to your own
behaviour and conduct" (and, indeed, those only are fit to reprove
others who walk with due circumspection and care themselves): or else we
have here another remedy or rather preservative from the
before-mentioned sins; and this I take to be the design of the apostle,
being impossible to maintain purity and holiness of heart and life
without great circumspection and care. Walk circumspectly, or, as the
word signifies, accurately, exactly, in the right way, in order to which
we must be frequently consulting our rule, and the directions we have in
the sacred oracles. Not as fools, who walk at all adventures, and who
have no understanding of their duty, nor of the worth of their souls,
and through neglect, supineness, and want of care, fall into sin, and
destroy themselves; but as wise, as persons taught of God and endued
with wisdom from above. Circumspect walking is the effect of true
wisdom, but the contrary is the effect of folly. It follows, redeeming
the time ([Eph 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#016).md), literally,
buying the opportunity. It is a metaphor taken from merchants and
traders who diligently observe and improve the seasons for merchandise
and trade. It is a great part of Christian wisdom to redeem the time.
Good Christians must be good husbands of their time, and take care to
improve it to the best of purposes, by watching against temptations, by
doing good while it is in the power of their hands, and by filling it up
with proper employment - one special preservative from sin. They should
make the best use they can of the present seasons of grace. Our time is
a talent given us by God for some good end, and it is misspent and lost
when it is not employed according to his design. If we have lost our
time heretofore, we must endeavour to redeem it by doubling our
diligence in doing our duty for the future. The reason given is because
the days are evil, either by reason of the wickedness of those who dwell
in them, or rather "as they are troublesome and dangerous times to you
who live in them." Those were times of persecution wherein the apostle
wrote this: the Christians were in jeopardy every hour. When the days
are evil we have one superadded argument to redeem time, especially
because we know not how soon they may be worse. People are very apt to
complain of bad times; it were well if that would stir them up to redeem
time. "Wherefore," says the apostle ([Eph
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#017).md), "because of the badness of the
times, be you not unwise, ignorant of your duty and negligent about your
souls, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. Study, consider,
and further acquaint yourselves with the will of God, as determining
your duty." Observe, Ignorance of our duty, and neglect of our souls,
are evidences of the greatest folly; while an acquaintance with the will
of God, and a care to comply with it, bespeak the best and truest
wisdom.

II\. In the three following verses the apostle warns against some other
particular sins, and urges some other duties. 1. He warns against the
sin of drunkenness: And be not drunk with wine, [Eph
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#018.md). This was a sin very frequent
among the heathens; and particularly on occasion of the festivals of
their gods, and more especially in their Bacchanalia: then they were
wont to inflame themselves with wine, and all manner of inordinate lusts
were consequent upon it: and therefore the apostle adds, wherein, or in
which drunkenness, is excess. The word asōtia may signify luxury or
dissoluteness; and it is certain that drunkenness is no friend to
chastity and purity of life, but it virtually contains all manner of
extravagance, and transports men into gross sensuality and vile
enormities. Note, Drunkenness is a sin that seldom goes alone, but often
involves men in other instances of guilt: it is a sin very provoking to
God, and a great hindrance to the spiritual life. The apostle may mean
all such intemperance and disorder as are opposite to the sober and
prudent demeanor he intends in his advice, to redeem the time. 2.
Instead of being filled with wine, he exhorts them to be filled with the
Spirit. Those who are full of drink are not likely to be full of the
Spirit; and therefore this duty is opposed to the former sin. The
meaning of the exhortation is that men should labour for a plentiful
measure of the graces of the Spirit, that would fill their souls with
great joy, strength, and courage, which things sensual men expect their
wine should inspire them with. We cannot be guilty of any excess in our
endeavours after these: nay, we ought not to be satisfied with a little
of the Spirit, but to be aspiring after measures, so as to be filled
with the Spirit. Now by this means we shall come to understand what the
will of the Lord is; for the Spirit of God is given as a Spirit of
wisdom and of understanding. And because those who are filled with the
Spirit will be carried out in acts of devotion, and all the proper
expressions of it, therefore the apostle exhorts, 3. To sing unto the
Lord, [Eph 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#019.md). Drunkards are wont to
sing obscene and profane songs. The heathens, in their Bacchanalia, used
to sing hymns to Bacchus, whom they called the god of wine. Thus they
expressed their joy; but the joy of Christians should express itself in
songs of praise to their God. In these they should speak to themselves
in their assemblies and meetings together, for mutual edification. By
psalms may be meant David's psalms, or such composures as were fitly
sung with musical instruments. By hymns may be meant such others as were
confined to matter of praise, as those of Zacharias, Simeon, etc.
Spiritual songs may contain a greater variety of matter, doctrinal,
prophetical, historical, etc. Observe here, (1.) The singing of psalms
and hymns is a gospel ordinance: it is an ordinance of God, and
appointed for his glory. (2.) Though Christianity is an enemy to profane
mirth, yet it encourages joy and gladness, and the proper expressions of
these in the professors of it. God's people have reason to rejoice, and
to sing for joy. They are to sing and to make melody in their hearts;
not only with their voices, but with inward affection, and then their
doing this will be as delightful and acceptable to God as music is to
us: and it must be with a design to please him, and to promote his
glory, that we do this; and then it will be done to the Lord. 4.
Thanksgiving is another duty that the apostle exhorts to, [Eph
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#020.md). We are appointed to sing psalms,
etc., for the expression of our thankfulness to God; but, though we are
not always singing, we should never want a disposition for this duty, as
we never want matter for it. We must continue it throughout the whole
course of our lives; and we should give thanks for all things; not only
for spiritual blessings enjoyed, and eternal ones expected (for what of
the former we have in hand, and for what of the other we have in hope),
but for temporal mercies too; not only for our comforts, but also for
our sanctified afflictions; not only for what immediately concerns
ourselves, but for the instances of God's kindness and favour to others
also. It is our duty in every thing to give thanks unto God and the
Father, to God as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ and our Father in
him, in whose name we are to offer up all our prayers, and praises, and
spiritual services, that they may be acceptable to God.

[Ephesians 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eph 5:21</span></span>

Here the apostle begins his exhortation to the discharge of relative
duties. As a general foundation for these duties, he lays down that rule
[Eph 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#021.md). There is a mutual
submission that Christians owe one to another, condescending to bear one
another's burdens: not advancing themselves above others, nor
domineering over one another and giving laws to one another. Paul was an
example of this truly Christian temper, for he became all things to all
men. We must be of a yielding and of a submissive spirit, and ready to
all the duties of the respective places and stations that God has
allotted to us in the world. In the fear of God, that is, so far as is
consistent with the fear of God, for his sake, and out of conscience
towards him, and that hereby we may give proof that we truly fear him.
Where there is this mutual condescension and submission, the duties of
all relations will be the better performed. From [Eph
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022.md) to the end he speaks of the
duties of husbands and wives; and he speaks of these in a Christian
manner, setting the church as an example of the wife's subjection, and
Christ as an example of love in husbands.

I. The duty prescribed to wives is submission to their husbands in the
Lord ([Eph 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022).md), which submission
includes the honouring and obeying of them, and that from a principle of
love to them. They must do this in compliance with God's authority, who
has commanded it, which is doing it as unto the Lord; or it may be
understood by way of similitude and likeness, so that the sense may be,
"as, being devoted to God, you submit yourselves unto him." From the
former sense we may learn that by a conscientious discharge of the
duties we owe to our fellow-creatures we obey and please God himself;
and, from the latter, that God not only requires and insists on those
duties which immediately respect himself, but such as respect our
neighbours too. The apostle assigns the reason of this submission from
wives: For the husband is the head of the wife, [Eph
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#023.md). The metaphor is taken from the
head in the natural body, which, being the seat of reason, of wisdom,
and of knowledge, and the fountain of sense and motion, is more
excellent than the rest of the body. God has given the man the
pre-eminence and a right to direct and govern by creation, and in that
original law of the relation, Thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he
shall rule over thee. Whatever there is of uneasiness in this, it is an
effect of sin coming into the world. Generally, too, the man has (what
he ought to have) a superiority in wisdom and knowledge. He is therefore
the head, even as Christ is the head of the church. There is a
resemblance of Christ's authority over the church in that superiority
and headship which God has appointed to the husband. The apostle adds,
and he is the Saviour of the body. Christ's authority is exercised over
the church for the saving of her from evil, and the supplying of her
with every thing good for her. In like manner should the husband be
employed for the protection and comfort of his spouse; and therefore she
should the more cheerfully submit herself unto him. So it follows,
Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ ([Eph
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#024).md), with cheerfulness, with
fidelity, with humility, so let the wives be to their own husbands in
every thing - in every thing to which their authority justly extends
itself, in every thing lawful and consistent with duty to God.

II\. The duty of husbands (on the other hand), is to love their wives
([Eph 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025).md); for without this they
would abuse their superiority and headship, and, wherever this prevails
as it ought to do, it will infer the other duties of the relation, it
being a special and peculiar affection that is required in her behalf.
The love of Christ to the church is proposed as an example of this,
which love of his is a sincere, a pure, an ardent, and constant
affection, and that notwithstanding the imperfections and failures that
she is guilty of. The greatness of his love to the church appeared in
his giving himself unto the death for it. Observe, As the church's
subjection to Christ is proposed as an exemplar to wives, so the love of
Christ to his church is proposed as a pattern to husbands; and while
such exemplars are offered to both, and so much is required of each,
neither has reason to complain of the divine injunctions. The love which
God requires from the husband in behalf of his wife will make amends for
the subjection which he demands from her to her husband; and the
prescribed subjection of the wife will be an abundant return for that
love of the husband which God has made her due. The apostle, having
mentioned Christ's love to the church, enlarges upon it, assigning the
reason why he gave himself for it, namely, that he might sanctify it in
this world, and glorify it in the next: That he might sanctify and
cleanse it, with the washing of water by the word ([Eph
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026).md) - that he might endue all his
members with a principle of holiness, and deliver them from the guilt,
the pollution, and the dominion of sin. The instrumental means whereby
this is affected are the instituted sacraments, particularly the washing
of baptism and the preaching and reception of the gospel. And that he
might present it to himself, etc., [Eph
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027.md). Dr. Lightfoot thinks the apostle
alludes here to the Jews' extraordinary carefulness in their washings
for purification. They were careful that there should be no wrinkle to
keep the flesh from the water, and no spot nor dirt which was not
thoroughly washed. Others understand him as alluding to a garment come
newly out of the fuller's hand, purged from spots, stretched from
wrinkles, the former newly contracted, the latter by long time and
custom. That he might present it to himself - that he might perfectly
unite it to himself in the great day, a glorious church, perfect in
knowledge and in holiness, not having spot, nor wrinkle, nor any such
thing, nothing of deformity or defilement remaining, but being entirely
amiable and pleasing in his eye, holy and without blemish, free from the
least remains of sin. The church in general, and particular believers,
will not be without spot or wrinkle till they come to glory. From this
and the former verse together we may take notice that the glorifying of
the church is intended in the sanctifying of it: and that those, and
those only, who are sanctified now, will be glorified hereafter. - So
ought men to love their wives as their own bodies, etc., [Eph
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#028.md). The wife being made one with her
husband (not in a natural, but in a civil and in a relative sense), this
is an argument why he should love her with as cordial and as ardent an
affection as that which he loves himself. For no man ever yet hated his
own flesh, [Eph 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#029.md) - (no man in his
right senses ever hated himself, however deformed, or whatever his
imperfections might be); so far from it that he nourishes and cherishes
it; he uses himself with a great deal of care and tenderness, and is
industrious to supply himself with every thing convenient or good for
him, with food and clothing, etc. Even as the Lord the church: that is,
as the Lord nourishes and cherishes the church, which he furnishes with
all things that he sees needful or good for her, with whatever conduces
to her everlasting happiness and welfare. The apostle adds, For we are
members of his body, of his flesh and of his bones, [Eph
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#030.md). He assigns this as a reason why
Christ nourishes and cherishes his church - because all who belong to it
are members of his body, that is, of his mystical body. Or, we are
members out of his body: all the grace and glory which the church has
are from Christ, as Eve was taken out of the man. But, as one observes,
it being the manner of the sacred writings to express a complex body by
the enumeration of its several parts, as the heaven and earth for the
world, evening and morning for the natural day, so here, by body, flesh,
and bones, we are to understand himself, the meaning of the verse being
that we are members of Christ. - For this cause (because they are one,
as Christ and his church are one) shall a man leave his father and
mother; the apostle refers to the words of Adam, when Eve was given to
him for a meet help, [Gen 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024.md). We are
not to understand by this that a man's obligation to other relations is
cancelled upon his marriage, but only that this relation is to be
preferred to all others, there being a nearer union between these two
than between any others, that the man must rather leave any of those
than his wife. - And they two shall be one flesh, that is, by virtue of
the matrimonial bond. This is a great mystery, [Eph
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#032.md). Those words of Adam, just
mentioned by the apostle, are spoken literally of marriage; but they
have also a hidden mystical sense in them, relating to the union between
Christ and his church, of which the conjugal union between Adam and the
mother of us all was a type: though not instituted or appointed by God
to signify this, yet it was a kind of natural type, as having a
resemblance to it: I speak concerning Christ and the church.

After this, the apostle concludes this part of his discourse with a
brief summary of the duty of husbands and wives, [Eph
5:33](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#033.md). "Nevertheless (though there be
such a secret mystical sense, yet the plain literal sense concerns you)
let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself,
with such a sincere, peculiar, singular, and prevailing affection as
that is which he bears to himself. And the wife see that she reverence
her husband." Reverence consists of love and esteem, which produce a
care to please, and of fear, which awakens a caution lest just offence
be given. That the wife thus reverence her husband is the will of God
and the law of the relation.
