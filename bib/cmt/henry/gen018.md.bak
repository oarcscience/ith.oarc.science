### [Genesis Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 18:0</span></span>

We have an account in this chapter of another interview between God and
Abraham, probably within a few days after the former, as the reward of
his cheerful obedience to the law of circumcision. Here is, I. The kind
visit which God made him, and the kind entertainment which he gave to
that visit ([Gen 18:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#001).md). II. The
matters discoursed of between them. 1. The purposes of God's love
concerning Sarah ([Gen 18:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#009).md). 2.
The purposes of God's wrath concerning Sodom. (1.) The discovery God
made to Abraham of his design to destroy Sodom ([Gen
18:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#016)). (2..md) The intercession
Abraham made for Sodom ([Gen 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#023.md),
etc.).

[Genesis 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 18:1</span></span>

The appearance of God to Abraham seems to have had in it more of freedom
and familiarity, and less of grandeur and majesty, than those we have
hitherto read of; and therefore more resembles that great visit which,
in the fullness of time, the Son of God was to make to the world, when
the Word would be flesh, and appear as one of us. Observe here,

I. How Abraham expected strangers, and how richly his expectations were
answered ([Gen 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#001).md): He sat in the
tent-door, in the heat of the day; not so much to repose or divert
himself as to seek an opportunity of doing good, by giving entertainment
to strangers and travellers, there being perhaps no inns to accommodate
them. Note, 1. We are likely to have the most comfort of those good
works to which we are most free and forward. 2. God graciously visits
those in whom he has first raised the expectation of him, and manifests
himself to those that wait for him. When Abraham was thus sitting, he
saw three men coming towards him. These three men were three spiritual
heavenly beings, now assuming human bodies, that they might be visible
to Abraham, and conversable with him. Some think that they were all
created angels, others that one of them was the Son of God, the angel of
the covenant, whom Abraham distinguished from the rest ([Gen
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#003).md), and who is called Jehovah, [Gen
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#013.md). The apostle improves this for
the encouragement of hospitality, [Heb
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#002.md). Those that have been forward to
entertain strangers have entertained angels, to their unspeakable honour
and satisfaction. Where, upon a prudent and impartial judgment, we see
no cause to suspect ill, charity teaches us to hope well and to show
kindness accordingly. It is better to feed five drones, or wasps, than
to starve one bee.

II\. How Abraham entertained those strangers, and how kindly his
entertainment was accepted. The Holy Ghost takes particular notice of
the very free and affectionate welcome Abraham gave to the strangers. 1.
He was very complaisant and respectful to them. Forgetting his age and
gravity, he ran to meet them in the most obliging manner, and with all
due courtesy bowed himself towards the ground, though as yet he knew
nothing of them but that they appeared graceful respectable men. Note,
Religion does not destroy, but improve, good manners, and teaches us to
honour all men. Decent civility is a great ornament to piety. 2. He was
very earnest and importunate for their stay, and took it as a great
favour, [Gen 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#003.md), [Gen
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#004). Note, (1..md) It becomes those whom
God has blessed with plenty to be liberal and open-hearted in their
entertainments, according to their ability, and (not in compliment, but
cordially) to bid their friends welcome. We should take a pleasure in
showing kindness to any; for both God and man love a cheerful giver. Who
would eat the bread of him that has an evil eye? [Pro
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#006.md), [Pro
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#007). (2..md) Those that would have
communion with God must earnestly desire it and pray for it. God is a
guest worth entertaining. 3. His entertainment, though it was very free,
was yet plain and homely, and there was nothing in it of the gaiety and
niceness of our times. His dining-room was an arbour under a tree; no
rich table-linen, no side-board set with plate. His feast was a joint or
two of veal, and some cakes baked on the hearth, and both hastily
dressed up. Here were no dainties, no varieties, no forced-meats, no
sweet-meats, but good, plain, wholesome food, though Abraham was very
rich and his guests were very honourable. Note, We ought not to be
curious in our diet. Let us be thankful for food convenient, though it
be homely and common; and not be desirous of dainties, for they are
deceitful meat to those that love them and set their hearts upon them.
4. He and his wife were both of them very attentive and busy, in
accommodating their guests with the best they had. Sarah herself is cook
and baker; Abraham runs to fetch the calf, brings out the milk and
butter, and thinks it not below him to wait at table, that he might show
how heartily welcome his guests were. Note, (1.) Those that have real
merit need not take state upon them, nor are their prudent
condescensions any disparagement to them. (2.) Hearty friendship will
stoop to any thing but sin. Christ himself has taught us to wash one
another's feet, in humble love. Those that thus abase themselves shall
be exalted. Here Abraham's faith showed itself in good works; and so
must ours, else it is dead, [Jam 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#021.md),
[Jam 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#026.md). The father of the faithful
was famous for charity, and generosity, and good house-keeping; and we
must learn of him to do good and to communicate. Job did not eat his
morsel alone, [Job 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#017.md).

[Genesis 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 18:9</span></span>

These heavenly guests (being sent to confirm the promise lately made to
Abraham, that he should have a son by Sarah), while they are receiving
Abraham's kind entertainment, they return his kindness. He receives
angels, and has angels' rewards, a gracious message from heaven, [Mat
10:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#041.md).

I. Care is taken that Sarah should be within hearing. She must conceive
by faith, and therefore the promise must be made to her, [Heb
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#011.md). It was the modest usage of that
time that the women did not sit at meat with men, at least not with
strangers, but confined themselves to their own apartments; therefore
Sarah is here out of sight: but she must not be out of hearing. The
angels enquire ([Gen 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#009).md), Where is
Sarah thy wife? By naming her, they gave intimation enough to Abraham
that, though they seemed strangers, yet they very well knew him and his
family. By enquiring after her, they showed a friendly kind concern for
the family and relations of one whom they found respectful to them. It
is a piece of common civility, which ought to proceed from a principle
of Christian love, and then it is sanctified. And, by speaking of her
(she over-hearing it), they drew her to listen to what was further to be
said. Where is Sarah thy wife? say the angels. "Behold in the tent,"
says Abraham. "Where should she be else? There she is in her place, as
she uses to be, and is now within call." Note, 1. The daughters of Sarah
must learn of her to be chaste, keepers at home, [Tit
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#005.md). There is nothing got by gadding.
2. Those are most likely to receive comfort from God and his promises
that are in their place and in the way of their duty, [Luk
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#008.md).

II\. The promise is then renewed and ratified, that she should have a
son ([Gen 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#010).md): "I will certainly
return unto thee, and visit thee next time with the performance, as now
I do with the promise." God will return to those that bid him welcome,
that entertain his visits: "I will return thy kindness, Sarah thy wife
shall have a son;" it is repeated again, [Gen
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#014.md). Thus the promises of the
Messiah were often repeated in the Old Testament, for the strengthening
of the faith of God's people. We are slow of heart to believe, and
therefore have need of line upon line to the same purport. This is that
word of promise which the apostle quotes ([Rom
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#009).md) as that by the virtue of which
Isaac was born. Note, 1. The same blessings which others have from
common providence believers have from the promise, which makes them very
sweet and very sure. 2. The spiritual seed of Abraham owe their life,
and joy, and hope, and all, to the promise. They are born by the word of
God, [Pe1 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023.md).

III\. Sarah thinks this too good news to be true, and therefore cannot
as yet find in her heart to believe it: Sarah laughed within herself,
[Gen 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#012.md). It was not a pleasing
laughter of faith, like Abraham's ([Gen
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#017).md), but it was a laughter of
doubting and mistrust. Note, The same thing may be done from very
different principles, of which God only, who knows the heart, can judge.
The great objection which Sarah could not get over was her age: "I am
waxed old, and past childbearing in the course of nature, especially
having been hitherto barren, and (which magnifies the difficulty) my
lord is old also." Observe here, 1. Sarah calls Abraham her lord; it was
the only good word in this saying, and the Holy Ghost takes notice of it
to her honour, and recommends it to the imitation of all Christian
wives. [Pe1 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#006.md), Sarah obeyed Abraham,
calling him lord, in token of respect and subjection. Thus must the wife
reverence her husband, [Eph 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#033.md). And
thus must we be apt to take notice of what is spoken decently and well,
to the honour of those that speak it, though it may be mixed with that
which is amiss, over which we should cast a mantle of love. 2. Human
improbability often sets up in contradiction to the divine promise. The
objections of sense are very apt to stumble and puzzle the weak faith
even of true believers. It is hard to cleave to the first Cause, when
second causes frown. 3. Even where there is true faith, yet there are
often sore conflicts with unbelief, Sarah could say, Lord, I believe
([Heb 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#011).md), and yet must say, Lord,
help my unbelief.

IV\. The angel reproves the indecent expressions of her distrust, [Gen
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#013.md), [Gen
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#014.md). Observe, 1. Though Sarah was
now most kindly and generously entertaining these angels, yet, when she
did amiss, they reproved her for it, as Christ reproved Martha in her
own house, [Luk 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#040.md), [Luk
10:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#041.md). If our friends be kind to us,
we must not therefore be so unkind to them as to suffer sin upon them.
2. God gave this reproof to Sarah by Abraham her husband. To him he
said, Why did Sarah laugh? perhaps because he had not told her of the
promise which had been given him some time before to this purport, and
which, if he had communicated it to her with its ratifications, would
have prevented her from being so surprised now. Or Abraham was told of
it that he might tell her of it. Mutual reproof, when there is occasion
for it, is one of the duties of the conjugal relation. 3. The reproof
itself is plain, and backed with a good reason: Wherefore did Sarah
laugh? Note, It is good to enquire into the reason of our laughter, that
it may not be the laughter of the fool, [Ecc
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#006.md). "Wherefore did I laugh?" Again,
Our unbelief and distrust are a great offence to the God of heaven. He
justly takes it ill to have the objections of sense set up in
contradiction to his promise, as [Luk
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#018.md). 4. Here is a question asked
which is enough to answer all the cavils of flesh and blood: Is any
thing too hard for the Lord? (Heb. too wonderful), that is, (1.) Is any
thing so secret as to escape his cognizance? No, not Sarah's laughing,
though it was only within herself. Or, (2.) Is any thing so difficult as
to exceed his power? No, not the giving of a child to Sarah in her old
age.

V. Sarah foolishly endeavours to conceal her fault ([Gen
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#015).md): She denied, saying, I did not
laugh, thinking nobody could contradict her: she told this lie, because
she was afraid; but it was in vain to attempt concealing it from an
all-seeing eye; she was told, to her shame, Thou didst laugh. Now, 1.
There seems to be in Sarah a retraction of her distrust. Now she
perceived, by laying circumstances together, that it was a divine
promise which had been made concerning her, she renounced all doubting
distrustful thoughts about it. But, 2. There was withal a sinful attempt
to cover a sin with a lie. It is a shame to do amiss, but a greater
shame to deny it; for thereby we add iniquity to our iniquity. Fear of a
rebuke often betrays us into this snare. See [Isa
57:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#011.md), Whom hast thou feared, that
thou hast lied? But we deceive ourselves if we think to impose upon God;
he can and will bring truth to light, to our shame. He that covers his
sin cannot prosper, for the day is coming which will discover it.

[Genesis 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 18:16</span></span>

The messengers from heaven had now despatched one part of their
business, which was an errand of grace to Abraham and Sarah, and which
they delivered first; but now they have before them work of another
nature. Sodom is to be destroyed, and they must do it, [Gen
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#013.md). Note, As with the Lord there is
mercy, so he is the God to whom vengeance belongs. Pursuant to their
commission, we here find, 1. That they looked towards Sodom ([Gen
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#016).md); they set their faces against
it in wrath, as God is said to look unto the host of the Egyptians, [Exo
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#024.md). Note, Though God has long
seemed to connive at sinners, from which they have inferred that the
Lord does not see, does not regard, yet, when the day of his wrath
comes, he will look towards them. 2. That they went towards Sodom ([Gen
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#022).md), and accordingly we find two of
them at Sodom, [Gen 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001.md). Whether the
third was the Lord, before whom Abraham yet stood, and to whom he drew
near ([Gen 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#023).md), as most think, or
whether the third left them before they came to Sodom, and the Lord
before whom Abraham stood was the shechinah, or that appearance of the
divine glory which Abraham had formerly seen and conversed with, is
uncertain. However, we have here,

I. The honour Abraham did to his guests: He went with them to bring them
on the way, as one that was loth to part with such good company, and was
desirous to pay his utmost respects to them. This is a piece of civility
proper to be shown to our friends; but it must be done as the apostle
directs ([Jo3 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#006).md), after a godly
sort.

II\. The honour they did to him; for those that honour God he will
honour. God communicated to Abraham his purpose to destroy Sodom, and
not only so, but entered into a free conference with him about it.
Having taken him, more closely than before, into covenant with himself
(ch. 17), he here admits him into more intimate communion with himself
than ever, as the man of his counsel. Observe here,

1\. God's friendly thoughts concerning Abraham, [Gen
18:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#017.md), where we have his resolution
to make known to Abraham his purpose concerning Sodom, with the reasons
of it. If Abraham had not brought them on their way, perhaps he would
not have been thus favoured; but he that loves to walk with wise men
shall be wise, [Pro 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#020.md). See how God
is pleased to argue with himself: Shall I hide from Abraham (or, as some
read it, Am I concealing from Abraham) that thing which I do? "Can I go
about such a thing, and not tell Abraham?" Thus does God, in his
counsels, express himself, after the manner of men, with deliberation.
But why must Abraham be of the cabinet-council? The Jews suggest that
because God had granted the land of Canaan to Abraham and his seed
therefore he would not destroy those cities which were a part of that
land, without his knowledge and consent. But God here gives two other
reasons: -

(1.) Abraham must know, for he is a friend and a favourite, and one that
God has a particular kindness for and great things in store for. He is
to become a great nation; and not only so, but in the Messiah, who is to
come from his loins, All nations of the earth shall be blessed. Note,
The secret of the Lord is with those that fear him, [Psa
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#014.md); [Pro
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#032.md). Those who by faith live a life
of communion with God cannot but know more of his mind than other
people, though not with a prophetical, yet with a prudential practical
knowledge. They have a better insight than others into what is present
([Hos 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#009.md); [Psa
107:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#043).md), and a better foresight of
what is to come, at least so much as suffices for their guidance and for
their comfort.

(2.) Abraham must know, for he will teach his household: I know Abraham
very well, that he will command his children and his household after
him, [Gen 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#019.md). Consider this, \[1.\]
As a very bright part of Abraham's character and example. He not only
prayed with his family, but he taught them as a man of knowledge, nay,
he commanded them as a man in authority, and was prophet and king, as
well as priest, in his own house. Observe, First, God having made the
covenant with him and his seed, and his household being circumcised
pursuant to that, he was very careful to teach and rule them well. Those
that expect family blessings must make conscience of family duty. If our
children be the Lord's, they must be nursed for him; if they wear his
livery, they must be trained up in his work. Secondly, Abraham took care
not only of his children, but of his household; his servants were
catechized servants. Masters of families should instruct and inspect the
manners of all under their roof. The poorest servants have precious
souls that must be looked after. Thirdly, Abraham made it his care and
business to promote practical religion in his family. He did not fill
their heads with matters of nice speculation, or doubtful disputation;
but he taught them to keep the way of the Lord, and to do judgment and
justice, that is, to be serious and devout in the worship of God and to
be honest in their dealings with all men. Fourthly, Abraham, herein, had
an eye to posterity, and was in care not only that his household with
him, but that his household after him, should keep the way of the Lord,
that religion might flourish in his family when he was in his grave.
Fifthly, His doing this was the fulfilling of the conditions of the
promises which God had made him. Those only can expect the benefit of
the promises that make conscience of their duty. \[2.\] As the reason
why God would make known to him his purpose concerning Sodom, because he
was communicative of his knowledge, and improved it for the benefit of
those that were under his charge. Note, To him that hath shall be given,
[Mat 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#012.md); [Mat
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#029.md). Those that make a good use of
their knowledge shall know more.

2\. God's friendly talk with Abraham, in which he makes known to him
purpose concerning Sodom, and allows him a liberty of application to him
about the matter. (1.) He tells him of the evidence there was against
Sodom: The cry of Sodom is great, [Gen
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#020.md). Note, Some sins, and the sins
of some sinners, cry aloud to heaven for vengeance. The iniquity of
Sodom was crying iniquity, that is, it was so very provoking that it
even urged God to punish. (2.) The enquiry he would make upon this
evidence: I will go down now and see, [Gen
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#021.md). Not as if there were any thing
concerning which God is in doubt, or in the dark; but he is pleased thus
to express himself after the manner of men, \[1.\] To show the
incontestable equity of all his judicial proceedings. Men are apt to
suggest that his way is not equal; but let them know that his judgments
are the result of an eternal counsel, and are never rash or sudden
resolves. He never punishes upon report, or common fame, or the
information of others, but upon his own certain and infallible
knowledge. \[2.\] To give example to magistrates, and those in
authority, with the utmost care and diligence to enquire into the merits
of a cause, before they give judgment upon it. \[3.\] Perhaps the decree
is here spoken of as not yet peremptory, that room and encouragement
might be given to Abraham to make intercession for them. Thus God looked
if there were any to intercede, [Isa
59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016.md).

[Genesis 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 18:23</span></span>

Communion with God is kept up by the word and by prayer. In the word God
speaks to us; in prayer we speak to him. God had revealed to Abraham his
purposes concerning Sodom; now from this Abraham takes occasion to speak
to God on Sodom's behalf. Note, God's word then does us good when it
furnishes us with matter for prayer and excites us to it. When God has
spoken to us, we must consider what we have to say to him upon it.
Observe,

I. The solemnity of Abraham's address to God on this occasion: Abraham
drew near, [Gen 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#023.md). The expression
intimates, 1. A holy concern: He engaged his heart to approach to God,
[Jer 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#021.md). "Shall Sodom be destroyed,
and I not speak one good word for it?" 2. A holy confidence: He drew
near with an assurance of faith, drew near as a prince, [Job
31:37](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#037.md). Note, When we address ourselves
to the duty of prayer, we ought to remember that we are drawing near to
God, that we may be filled with a reverence of him, [Lev
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003.md).

II\. The general scope of this prayer. It is the first solemn prayer we
have upon record in the Bible; and it is a prayer for the sparing of
Sodom. Abraham, no doubt, greatly abhorred the wickedness of the
Sodomites; he would not have lived among them, as Lot did, if they would
have given him the best estate in their country; and yet he prayed
earnestly for them. Note, Though sin is to be hated, sinners are to be
pitied and prayed for. God delights not in their death, nor should we
desire, but deprecate, the woeful day. 1. He begins with a prayer that
the righteous among them might be spared, and not involved in the common
calamity, having an eye particularly to just Lot, whose disingenuous
carriage towards him he had long since forgiven and forgotten, witness
his friendly zeal to rescue him before by his sword and now by his
prayers. 2. He improves this into a petition that all might be spared
for the sake of the righteous that were among them, God himself
countenancing this request, and in effect putting him upon it by his
answer to his first address, [Gen
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#026.md). Note, We must pray, not only
for ourselves, but for others also; for we are members of the same body,
at least of the same body of mankind. All we are brethren.

III\. The particular graces eminent in this prayer.

1\. Here is great faith; and it is the prayer of faith that is the
prevailing prayer. His faith pleads with God, orders the cause, and
fills his mouth with arguments. He acts faith especially upon the
righteousness of God, and is very confident.

(1.) That God will not destroy the righteous with the wicked, [Gen
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#023.md). No, that be far from thee, [Gen
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#025.md). We must never entertain any
thought that derogates from the honour of God's righteousness. See [Rom
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005.md), [Rom
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#006.md). Note, \[1.\] The righteous are
mingled with the wicked in this world. Among the best there are,
commonly, some bad, and among the worst some good: even in Sodom, one
Lot. \[2.\] Though the righteous be among the wicked, yet the righteous
God will not, certainly he will not, destroy the righteous with the
wicked. Though in this world they may be involved in the same common
calamities, yet in the great day a distinction with be made.

(2.) That the righteous shall not be as the wicked, [Gen
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#025.md). Though they may suffer with
them, yet they do not suffer like them. Common calamities are quite
another thing to the righteous than what they are to the wicked, [Isa
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#007.md).

(3.) That the Judge of all the earth will do right; undoubtedly he will,
because he is the Judge of all the earth; it is the apostle's argument,
[Rom 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005.md), [Rom
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#006.md). Note, \[1.\] God is the Judge of
all the earth; he gives charge to all, takes cognizance of all, and will
pass sentence upon all. \[2.\] That God Almighty never did nor ever will
do any wrong to any of the creatures, either by withholding that which
is right or by exacting more than is right, [Job
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#010.md), [Job
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#011.md).

2\. Here is great humility.

(1.) A deep sense of his own unworthiness ([Gen
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#027).md): Behold now, I have taken upon
me to speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and ashes; and again, [Gen
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#031.md). He speaks as one amazed at his
own boldness, and the liberty God graciously allowed him, considering
God's greatness - he is the Lord; and his own meanness - but dust and
ashes. Note, \[1.\] The greatest of men, the most considerable and
deserving, are but dust and ashes, mean and vile before God, despicable,
frail, and dying. \[2.\] Whenever we draw near to God, it becomes us
reverently to acknowledge the vast distance that there is between us and
God. He is the Lord of glory, we are worms of the earth. \[3.\] The
access we have to the throne of grace, and the freedom of speech allowed
us, are just matter of humble wonder, [Sa2
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#018.md).

(2.) An awful dread of God's displeasure: O let not the Lord be angry
([Gen 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#030).md), and again, [Gen
18:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#032.md). Note, \[1.\] The importunity
which believers use in their addresses to God is such that, if they were
dealing with a man like themselves, they could not but fear that he
would be angry with them. But he with whom we have to do is God and not
man; and, whoever he may seem, is not really angry with the prayers of
the upright ([Psa 80:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#004).md), for they are
his delight ([Pro 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#008).md), and he is
pleased when he is wrestled with. \[2.\] That even when we receive
special tokens of the divine favour we ought to be jealous over
ourselves, lest we make ourselves obnoxious to the divine displeasure;
and therefore we must bring the Mediator with us in the arms of our
faith, to atone for the iniquity of our holy things.

3\. Here is great charity. (1.) A charitable opinion of Sodom's
character: as bad as it was, he thought there were several good people
in it. It becomes us to hope the best of the worst places. Of the two it
is better to err in that extreme. (2.) A charitable desire of Sodom's
welfare: he used all his interest at the throne of grace for mercy for
them. We never find him thus earnest in pleading with God for himself
and his family, as here for Sodom.

4\. Here are great boldness and believing confidence. (1.) He took the
liberty to pitch upon a certain number of righteous ones which he
supposed might be in Sodom. Suppose there be fifty, [Gen
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#024). (2..md) He advanced upon God's
concessions, again and again. As God granted much, he still begged more,
with the hope of gaining his point. (3.) He brought the terms as low as
he could for shame (having prevailed for mercy if there were but ten
righteous ones in five cities), and perhaps so low that he concluded
they would have been spared.

IV\. The success of the prayer. He that thus wrestled prevailed
wonderfully; as a prince he had power with God: it was but ask and have.
1. God's general good-will appears in this, that he consented to spare
the wicked for the sake of the righteous. See how swift God is to show
mercy; he even seeks a reason for it. See what great blessings good
people are to any place, and how little those befriend themselves that
hate and persecute them. 2. His particular favour to Abraham appeared in
this, that he did not leave off granting till Abraham left off asking.
Such is the power of prayer. Why then did Abraham leave off asking, when
he had prevailed so far as to get the place spared it there were but ten
righteous in it? Either, (1.) Because he owned that it deserved to be
destroyed if there were not so many; as the dresser of the vineyard, who
consented that the barren tree should be cut down if one year's trial
more did not make it fruitful, [Luk
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#009). Or, (2..md) Because God restrained
his spirit from asking any further. When God has determined the ruin of
a place, he forbids it to be prayed for, [Jer
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#016.md); [Jer
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#014.md); [Jer
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#011.md).

V. Here is the breaking up of the conference, [Gen
18:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#033.md). 1. The Lord went his way. The
visions of God must not be constant in this world, where it is by faith
only that we are to set God before us. God did not go away till Abraham
had said all he had to say; for he is never weary of hearing prayer,
[Isa 59:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001.md). 2. Abraham returned unto
his place, not puffed up with the honour done him, nor by these
extraordinary interviews taken off from the ordinary course of duty. He
returned to his place to observe what that event would be; and it proved
that his prayer was heard, and yet Sodom was not spared, because there
were not ten righteous in it. We cannot expect too little from man nor
too much from God.
