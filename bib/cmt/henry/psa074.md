### [Psalms Chapter 74](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 74:0</span></span>

This psalm does so particularly describe the destruction of Jerusalem
and the temple, by Nebuchadnezzar and the army of the Chaldeans, and can
so ill be applied to any other event we meet with in the Jewish history,
that interpreters incline to think that either it was penned by David,
or Asaph in David's time, with a prophetical reference to that sad event
(which yet is not so probable), or that it was penned by another Asaph,
who lived at the time of the captivity, or by Jeremiah (for it is of a
piece with his Lamentations,) or some other prophet, and, after the
return out of captivity, was delivered to the sons of Asaph, who were
called by his name, for the public service of the church. That was the
most eminent family of the singers in Ezra's time. See [Ezr
2:41](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#041.md); [Ezr
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#010.md); [Neh
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#017.md), [Neh
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#022.md); [Neh
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#035.md), [Neh
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#046.md). The deplorable case of the
people of God at that time is here spread before the Lord, and left with
him. The prophet, in the name of the church I. Puts in complaining pleas
of the miseries they suffered, for the quickening of their desires in
prayer ([Psa 74:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001).md). II. He puts in
comfortable pleas for the encouraging of their faith in prayer ([Psa
74:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#012).md). III. He concludes with
divers petitions to God for deliverances ([Psa
74:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#018).md). In singing it we must be
affected with the former desolations of the church, for we are members
of the same body, and may apply it to any present distresses or
desolations of any part of the Christian church.

Maschil of Asaph.

[Psalms 74:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 74:1</span></span>

This psalm is entitled Maschil - a psalm to give instruction, for it was
penned in a day of affliction, which is intended for instruction; and
this instruction in general it gives us, That when we are, upon any
account, in distress, it is our wisdom and duty to apply to God by
faithful and fervent prayer, and we shall not find it in vain to do so.
Three things the people of God here complain of: -

I. The displeasure of God against them, as that which was the cause and
bitterness of all their calamities. They look above the instruments of
their trouble, who, they knew, could have no power against them unless
it were given them from above, and keep their eye upon God, by whose
determined counsel they were delivered up into the hands of wicked and
unreasonable men. Observe the liberty they take to expostulate with God
([Psa 74:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001).md), we hope not too great a
liberty, for Christ himself, upon the cross, cried out, My God my God,
why hast thou forsaken me? So the church here, O God! why hast thou
forsaken us for ever? Here they speak according to their present dark
and melancholy apprehensions; for otherwise, Has God cast away his
people? God forbid, [Rom 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001.md). The
people of God must not think that because they are cast down they are
therefore cast off, that because men cast them off therefore God does,
and that because he seems to cast them off for a time therefore they are
really cast off for ever: yet this expostulation intimates that they
dreaded God's casting them off more than any thing, that they desired to
be owned of him, whatever they suffered from men, and were desirous to
know wherefore he thus contended with them: Why does thy anger smoke?
that is, why does it rise up to such a degree that all about us take
notice of it, and ask, What means the heat of this great anger? [Deu
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#024.md). Compare [Psa
74:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#020.md), where the anger of the Lord and
his jealousy are said to smoke against sinners. Observe what they plead
with God, now that they lay under the tokens and apprehensions of his
wrath. 1. They plead their relation to him: "We are the sheep of thy
pasture, the sheep wherewith thou hast been pleased to stock the
pasture, thy peculiar people whom thou art pleased to set apart for
thyself and design for thy own glory. That the wolves worry the sheep is
not strange; but was ever any shepherd thus displeased at his own sheep?
Remember, we are thy congregation ([Psa
74:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#002).md), incorporated by thee and for
thee, and devoted to thy praise; we are the rod, or tribe, of thy
inheritance, whom thou hast been pleased to claim a special property in
above other people ([Deu 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009).md), and
from whom thou hast received the rents and issues of praise and worship
more than from the neighbouring nations. Nay, a man's inheritance may
lie at a great distance, but we are pleading for Mount Zion, wherein
thou hast dwelt, which has been the place of thy peculiar delight and
residence, thy demesne and mansion." 2. They plead the great things God
had done for them and the vast expense he had been at upon them: "It is
thy congregation, which thou hast not only made with a word's speaking,
but purchased of old by many miracles of mercy when they were first
formed into a people; it is thy inheritance, which thou hast redeemed
when they were sold into servitude." God gave Egypt to ruin for their
ransom, gave men for them, and people for their life, [Isa
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003.md), [Isa
43:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#004.md). "Now, Lord, wilt thou now
abandon a people that cost thee so dear, and has been so dear to thee?"
And, if the redemption of Israel out of Egypt was an encouragement to
hope that he would not cast them off, much more reason have we to hope
that God will not cast off any whom Christ has redeemed with his own
blood; but the people of his purchase shall be for ever the people of
his praise. 3. They plead the calamitous state that they were in ([Psa
74:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#003).md): "Lift up thy feet; that is,
come with speed to repair the desolations that are made in thy
sanctuary, which otherwise will be perpetual an irreparable." It has
been sometimes said that the divine vengeance strikes with iron hands,
yet it comes with leaden feet; and then those who wait for the day of
the Lord, cry, Lord, lift up thy feet; exalt thy steps; magnify thyself
in the outgoing of thy providence. When the desolations of the sanctuary
have continued long we are tempted to think they will be perpetual; but
it is a temptation; for God will avenge his own elect, will avenge them
speedily, though he bear long with their oppressors and persecutors.

II\. They complain of the outrage and cruelty of their enemies, not so
much, no, not at all, of what they had done to the prejudice of their
secular interests; here are no complaints of the burning of their cities
and ravaging of their country, but only what they had done against the
sanctuary and the synagogue. The concerns of religion should lie nearer
our hearts and affect us more than any worldly concern whatsoever. The
desolation of God's house should grieve us more than the desolation of
our own houses; for the matter is not great what becomes of us and our
families in this world provided God's name may be sanctified, his
kingdom may come, and his will be done.

1\. The psalmist complains of the desolations of the sanctuary, as
Daniel, [Dan 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#017.md). The temple at
Jerusalem was the dwelling-place of God's name, and therefore the
sanctuary, or holy place, [Psa 74:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#007.md).
In this the enemies did wickedly ([Psa
74:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#003).md), for they destroyed it in
downright contempt of God and affront to him. (1.) They roared in the
midst of God's congregations, [Psa
74:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#004.md). There where God's faithful
people attended on him with a humble reverent silence, or softly
speaking, they roared in a riotous revelling manner, being elated with
having made themselves masters of that sanctuary of which they had
sometimes heard formidable things. (2.) They set up their ensigns for
signs. The banners of their army they set up in the temple (Israel's
strongest castle, as long as they kept closely to God) as trophies of
their victory. There, where the signs of God's presence used to be, now
the enemy had set up their ensigns. This daring defiance of God and his
power touched his people in a tender part. (3.) They took a pride in
destroying the carved work of the temple. As much as formerly men
thought it an honour to lend a hand to the building of the temple, and
he was thought famous that helped to fell timber for that work, so much
now they valued themselves upon their agency in destroying it, [Psa
74:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#005.md), [Psa
74:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#006.md). Thus, as formerly those were
celebrated for wise men that did service to religion, so now those are
applauded as wits that help to run it down. Some read it thus: They show
themselves, as one that lifts up axes on high in a thicket of trees, for
so do they break down the carved work of the temple they make no more
scruple of breaking down the rich wainscot of the temple than
woodcutters do of hewing trees in the forest; such indignation have they
at the sanctuary that the most curious carving that ever was seen is
beaten down by the common soldiers without any regard had to it, either
as a dedicated thing or as a piece of exquisite art. (4.) They set fire
to it, and so violated or destroyed it to the ground, [Psa
74:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#007.md). The Chaldeans burnt the house of
God, that stately costly fabric, [Ch2
36:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#019.md). And the Romans left not there
one stone upon another ([Mat 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#002).md),
rasing it, rasing it, even to the foundations, till Zion, the holy
mountain, was, by Titus Vespasian, ploughed as a field.

2\. He complains of the desolations of the synagogues, or schools of the
prophets, which, before the captivity, were in use, though much more
afterwards. There God's word was read and expounded, and his name
praised and called upon, without altars or sacrifices. These also they
had a spite to ([Psa 74:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#008).md): Let us
destroy them together; not only the temple, but all the places of
religious worship and the worshippers with them. Let us destroy them
together; let them be consumed in the same flame. Pursuant to this
impious resolve they burnt up all the synagogues of God in the land and
laid them all waste. So great was their rage against religion that the
religious houses, because religious, were all levelled with the ground,
that God's worshippers might not glorify God, and edify one another, by
meeting in solemn assemblies.

III\. The great aggravation of all these calamities was that they had no
prospect at all of relief, nor could they foresee an end of them ([Psa
74:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#009).md): "We see our enemy's sign set up
in the sanctuary, but we see not our signs, none of the tokens of God's
presence, no hopeful indications of approaching deliverance. There is no
more any prophet to tell us how long the trouble will last and when
things concerning us shall have an end, that the hope of an issue at
last may support us under our troubles." In the captivity in Babylon
they had prophets, and had been told how long the captivity should
continue, but the day was cloudy and dark ([Eze
34:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#012).md), and they had not as yet the
comfort of these gracious discoveries. God spoke once, yea, twice, good
words and comfortable words, but they perceived them not. Observe, They
do not complain, "We see not our armies; there are no men of war to
command our forces, nor any to go forth with our hosts;" but, "no
prophets, none to tell us how long." This puts them upon expostulating
with God, as delaying, 1. To assert his honour ([Psa
74:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#010).md): How long shall the adversary
reproach and blaspheme thy name? In the desolations of the sanctuary our
chief concern should be for the glory of God, that it may not be injured
by the blasphemies of those who persecute his people for his sake,
because they are his; and therefore our enquiry should be, not "How long
shall we be troubled?" but "How long shall God be blasphemed?" 2. To
exert his power ([Psa 74:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#011).md): "Why
withdrawest thou thy hand, and dost not stretch it out, to deliver thy
people and destroy thy enemies? Pluck it out of thy bosom, and be not as
a man astonished, as a mighty man that cannot save, or will not," [Jer
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#009.md). When the power of enemies is
most threatening it is comfortable to fly to the power of God.

[Psalms 74:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 74:12</span></span>

The lamenting church fastens upon something here which she calls to
mind, and therefore hath she hope (as [Lam
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#021).md), with which she encourages
herself and silences her own complaints. Two things quiet the minds of
those that are here sorrowing for the solemn assembly: -

I. That God is the God of Israel, a God in covenant with his people
([Psa 74:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#012).md): God is my King of old.
This comes in both as a plea in prayer to God ([Psa
44:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#004), thou art my King, O God!.md) and as
a prop to their own faith and hope, to encourage themselves to expect
deliverance, considering the days of old, [Psa
77:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#005.md). The church speaks as a complex
body, the same in every age, and therefore calls God, "My King, my King
of old," or, "from antiquity;" he of old put himself into that relation
to them and appeared and acted for them in that relation. As Israel's
King, he wrought salvation in the midst of the nations of the earth; for
what he did, in the government of the world, tended towards the
salvation of his church. Several things are here mentioned which God had
done for his people as their King of old, which encouraged them to
commit themselves to him and depend upon him.

1\. He had divided the sea before them when they came out of Egypt, not
by the strength of Moses or his rod, but by his own strength; and he
that could do that could do any thing.

2\. He had destroyed Pharaoh and the Egyptians. Pharaoh was the
leviathan; the Egyptians were the dragons, fierce and cruel. Observe,
(1.) The victory obtained over these enemies. God broke their heads,
baffled their politics, as when Israel, the more they were afflicted by
them, multiplied the more. God crushed their powers, though complicated,
ruined their country by ten plagues, and at last drowned them all in the
Red Sea. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, [Eze
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#018.md). It was the Lord's doing; none
besides could do it, and he did it with a strong hand and an
outstretched arm. This was typical of Christ's victory over Satan and
his kingdom, pursuant to the first promise, that the seed of the woman
should break the serpent's head. (2.) The improvement of this victory
for the encouragement of the church: Thou gavest him to be meat to the
people of Israel, now going to inhabit the wilderness. The spoil of the
Egyptians enriched them; they stripped their slain, and so got the
Egyptians' arms and weapons, as before they had got their jewels. Or,
rather, this providence was meat to their faith and hope, to support and
encourage them in reference to the other difficulties they were likely
to meet with in the wilderness. It was part of the spiritual meat which
they were all made to eat of. Note, The breaking of the heads of the
church's enemies is the joy and strength of the hearts of the church's
friends. Thus the companions make a banquet even of leviathan, [Job
41:6](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#006.md).

3\. God had both ways altered the course of nature, both in fetching
streams out of the rock and turning streams into rock, [Psa
74:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#015). (1..md) He had dissolved the rock
into waters: Thou didst bring out the fountain and the flood (so some
read it); and every one knows whence it was brought, out of the rock,
out of the flinty rock. Let this never be forgotten, but let it
especially be remembered that the rock was Christ, and the waters out of
it were spiritual drink. (2.) He had congealed the waters into rock:
Thou driedst up mighty rapid rivers, Jordan particularly at the time
when it overflowed all its banks. He that did these things could now
deliver his oppressed people, and break the yoke of the oppressors, as
he had done formerly; nay, he would do it, for his justice and goodness,
his wisdom and truth, are still the same, as well as his power.

II\. That the God of Israel is the God of nature, [Psa
74:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#016.md), [Psa
74:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#017.md). It is he that orders the
regular successions and revolutions, 1. Of day and night. He is the Lord
of all time. The evening and the morning are of his ordaining. It is he
that opens the eyelids of the morning light, and draws the curtains of
the evening shadow. He has prepared the moon and the sun (so some read
it), the two great lights, to rule by day and by night alternately. The
preparing of them denotes their constant readiness and exact observance
of their time, which they never miss a moment. 2. Of summer and winter:
"Thou hast appointed all the bounds of the earth, and the different
climates of its several regions, for thou hast made summer and winter,
the frigid and the torrid zones; or, rather, the constant revolutions of
the year and its several seasons." Herein we are to acknowledge God,
from whom all the laws and powers of nature are derived; but how does
this come in here? (1.) He that had power at first to settle, and still
to preserve, this course of nature by the diurnal and annual motions of
the heavenly bodies, has certainly all power both to save and to
destroy, and with him nothing is impossible, nor are any difficulties or
oppositions insuperable. (2.) He that is faithful to his covenant with
the day and with the night, and preserves the ordinances of heaven
inviolable will certainly make good his promise to his people and never
cast off those whom he has chosen, [Jer
31:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#035.md), [Jer
31:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#036.md); [Jer
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#020.md), [Jer
33:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#021.md). His covenant with Abraham and
his seed is as firm as that with Noah and his sons, [Gen
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021). (3..md) Day and night, summer and
winter, being counterchanged in the course of nature, throughout all the
borders of the earth, we can expect no other than that trouble and
peace, prosperity and adversity, should be, in like manner,
counterchanged in all the borders of the church. We have as much reason
to expect affliction as to expect night and winter. But we have then no
more reason to despair of the return of comfort than we have to despair
of day and summer.

[Psalms 74:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 74:18</span></span>

The psalmist here, in the name of the church, most earnestly begs that
God would appear fro them against their enemies, and put an end to their
present troubles. To encourage his own faith, he interests God in this
matter ([Psa 74:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#022).md): Arise, O God!
plead thy own cause. This we may be sure he will do, for he is jealous
for his own honour; whatever is his own cause he will plead it with a
strong hand, will appear against those that oppose it and with and for
those that cordially espouse it. He will arise and plead it, though for
a time he seems to neglect it; he will stir up himself, will manifest
himself, will do his own work in his own time. Note, The cause of
religion is God's own cause and he will certainly plead it. Now, to make
it out that the cause is God's, he pleads,

I. That the persecutors are God's sworn enemies: "Lord, they have not
only abused us, but they have been, and are, abusive to thee; what is
done against us, for thy sake, does, by consequence, reflect upon thee.
But that is not all; they have directly and immediately reproached thee,
and blasphemed thy name," [Psa 74:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#018.md).
This was that which they roared in the sanctuary; they triumphed as if
they had now got the mastery of the God is Israel, of whom they had
heard such great things. As nothing grieves the saints more than to hear
God's name blasphemed, so nothing encourages them more to hope that God
will appear against their enemies than when they have arrived at such a
pitch of wickedness as to reproach God himself; this fills the measure
of their sins apace and hastens their ruin. The psalmist insists much
upon this: "We dare not answer their reproaches; Lord, do thou answer
them. Remember that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name ([Psa
74:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#018).md) and that still the foolish man
reproaches thee daily." Observe the character of those that reproach
God; they are foolish. As atheism is folly ([Psa
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001).md), profaneness and blasphemy are
no less so. Perhaps those are cried up as the wits of the age that
ridicule religion and sacred things; but really they are the greatest
fools, and will shortly be made to appear so before all the world. And
yet see their malice - They reproach God daily, as constantly as his
faithful worshippers pray to him and praise him; see their impudence -
They do not hide their blasphemous thoughts in their own bosoms, but
proclaim them with a loud voice (forget not the voice of thy enemies,
[Psa 74:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#023).md), and this with a daring
defiance of divine justice; they rise up against thee, and by their
blasphemies even wage war with heaven and take up arms against the
Almighty. Their noise and tumult ascend continually (so some), as the
cry of Sodom came up before God, calling for vengeance, [Gen
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#021.md). It increases continually (so we
read it); they grow worse and worse, and are hardened in their impieties
by their successes. Now, Lord, remember this; do not forget it. God
needs not to be put in remembrance by us of what he has to do, but thus
we must show our concern for his honour and believe that he will
vindicate us.

II\. That the persecuted are his covenant-people. 1. See what distress
they are in. They have fallen into the hands of the multitude of the
wicked, [Psa 74:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#019.md). How are those
increased that trouble them! There is no standing before an enraged
multitude, especially like these, armed with power; and, as they are
numerous, so they are barbarous: The dark places of the earth are full
of the habitations of cruelty. The land of the Chaldeans, where there
was none of the light of the knowledge of the true God (though otherwise
it was famed for learning and arts), was indeed a dark place; the
inhabitants of it were alienated from the life of God through the
ignorance that was in them, and therefore they were cruel: where there
was no true divinity there was scarcely to be found common humanity.
They were especially cruel to the people of God; certainly those have no
knowledge who eat them up, [Psa 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#004.md).
They are oppressed ([Psa 74:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#021).md)
because they are poor and unable to help themselves; they are oppressed,
and so impoverished and made poor. 2. See what reason they had to hope
that God would appear for their relief and not suffer them to be always
thus trampled upon. Observe how the psalmist pleads with God for them.
(1.) "It is thy turtle-dove that is ready to be swallowed up by the
multitude of the wicked," [Psa 74:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#019.md).
The church is a dove for harmlessness and mildness, innocency and
inoffensiveness, purity and fruitfulness, a dove for mournfulness in a
day of distress, a turtle-dove for fidelity and the constancy of love:
turtle-doves and pigeons were the only fowls that were offered in
sacrifice to God. "Shall thy turtle-dove, that is true to thee and
devoted to thy honour, be delivered, its life and soul and all, into the
hand of the multitude of the wicked, to whom it will soon become an easy
and acceptable prey? Lord, it will be thy honour to help the weak,
especially to help thy own." (2.) "It is the congregation of thy poor,
and they are not the less thine for their being poor (for God has chosen
the poor of this world, [Jam 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#005).md), but
they have the more reason to expect thou wilt appear for them because
they are many: it is the congregation of thy poor; let them not be
abandoned and forgotten for ever." (3.) "They are in covenant with thee;
and wilt thou not have respect unto the covenant? [Psa
74:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#020.md). Wilt thou not perform the
promises thou hast, in thy covenant, made to them? Wilt thou not own
those whom thou hast brought into the bond of the covenant?" When God
delivers his people it is in remembrance of his covenant, [Lev
26:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#042.md). "Lord, though we are unworthy
to be respected, yet have respect to the covenant." (4.) "They trust in
thee, and boast of their relation to thee and expectations from thee. O
let not them return ashamed of their hope ([Psa
74:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#021).md), as they will be if they be
disappointed." (5.) "If thou deliver them, they will praise thy name and
give thee the glory of their deliverance. Appear, Lord, for those that
will praise thy name, against those that blaspheme it."
