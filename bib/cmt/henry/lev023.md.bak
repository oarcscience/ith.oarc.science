### [Leviticus Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 23:0</span></span>

Hitherto the levitical law had been chiefly conversant about holy
persons, holy things, and holy places; in this chapter we have the
institution of holy times, many of which had been mentioned occasionally
before, but here they are all put together, only the new moons are not
mentioned. All the rest of the feasts of the Lord are, I. The weekly
feast of the sabbath ([Lev 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#003).md). II.
The yearly feasts, 1. The passover, and the feast of unleavened bread
([Lev 23:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#004).md), to which was annexed
the offering of the sheaf of firstfruits ([Lev
23:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#009).md). 2. Pentecost ([Lev
23:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015).md). 3. The solemnities of the
seventh month. The feast of trumpets on the first day ([Lev
23:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#023).md), the day of atonement on the
tenth day ([Lev 23:26-32](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#026).md), and the
feast of tabernacles on the fifteenth ([Lev
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#033), etc..md).

[Leviticus 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 23:1</span></span>

Here is, I. A general account of the holy times which God appointed
([Lev 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#002).md), and it is only his
appointment that can make time holy; for he is the Lord of time, and as
soon as ever he had set its wheels a-going it was he that sanctified and
blessed one day above the rest, [Gen
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#003.md). Man may by his appointment make a
good day ([Est 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#019).md), but it is God's
prerogative to make a holy day; nor is any thing sanctified but by the
stamp of his institution. As all inherent holiness comes from his
special grace, so all adherent holiness from his special appointment.
Now, concerning the holy times here ordained, observe, 1. They are
called feasts. The day of atonement, which was one of them, was a fast;
yet, because most of them were appointed for joy and rejoicing, they are
in the general called feasts. Some read it, These are my assemblies, but
that is co-incident with convocations. I would rather read it, These are
my solemnities; so the word here used is translated ([Isa
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#020).md), where Zion is called the city
of our solemnities: and, reading it so here, the day of atonement was as
great a solemnity as any of them. 2. They are the feasts of the Lord (my
feasts), observed to the honour of his name, and in obedience to his
command. 3. They were proclaimed; for they were not to be observed by
the priests only that attended the sanctuary, but by all the people. And
this proclamation was the joyful sound concerning which we read, Blessed
are the people that know it, [Psa
89:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#015.md). 4. They were to be sanctified
and solemnized with holy convocations, that the services of these feasts
might appear the more honourable and august, and the people the more
unanimous in the performance of them; it was for the honour of God and
his institutions, which sought not corners and the purity of which would
be best preserved by the public administration of them; it was also for
the edification of the people in love that the feasts were to be
observed as holy convocations.

II\. A repetition of the law of the sabbath in the first place. Though
the annual feasts were made more remarkable by the general attendance at
the sanctuary, yet these must not eclipse the brightness of the sabbath,
[Lev 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#003.md). They are here told, 1. That
on that day they must withdraw themselves from all the affairs and
business of the world. It is a sabbath of rest, typifying our spiritual
rest from sin, and in God: You shall do no work therein. On other holy
days they were forbidden to do any servile work ([Lev
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#007).md), but on the sabbath, and the day
of atonement (which is also called a sabbath), they were to do no work
at all, no, not the dressing of meat. 2. On that day they must employ
themselves in the service of God. (1.) It is a holy convocation; that
is, "If it lie within your reach, you shall sanctify it in a religious
assembly: let as many as can come to the door of the tabernacle, and let
others meet elsewhere for prayer, and praise, and the reading of the
law," as in the schools of the prophets, while prophecy continued, and
afterwards in the synagogues. Christ appointed the New Testament sabbath
to be a holy convocation, by meeting his disciples once and again (and
perhaps oftener) on the first day of the week. (2.) "Whether you have
opportunity of sanctifying it in a holy convocation or not, yet let it
be the sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings. Put a difference
between that day and other days in your families. It is the sabbath of
the Lord, the day on which he rested from the work of creation, and on
which he has appointed us to rest; let it be observed in all your
dwellings, even now that you dwell in tents." Note, God's sabbaths are
to be religiously observed in every private house, by every family
apart, as well as by many families together in holy convocations. The
sabbath of the Lord in our dwellings will be their beauty, strength, and
safety; it will sanctify, edify, and glorify them.

[Leviticus 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 23:4</span></span>

Here again the feasts are called the feasts of the Lord, because he
appointed them. Jeroboam's feast, which he devised of his own heart
([Kg1 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#033).md), was an affront to God,
and a reproach upon the people. These feasts were to be proclaimed in
their seasons ([Lev 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#004).md), and the
seasons God chose for them were in March, May and September (according
to our present computation), not in winter, because travelling would
then be uncomfortable, when the days were short, and the ways foul; not
in the middle of summer, because then in those countries they were
gathering in their harvest and vintage, and could be ill spared from
their country business. Thus graciously does God consult our comfort in
his appointments, obliging us thereby religiously to regard his glory in
our observance of them, and not to complain of them as a burden. The
solemnities appointed them were, 1. Many and returned frequently, which
was intended to preserve in them a deep sense of God and religion, and
to prevent their inclining to the superstitions of the heathen. God kept
them fully employed in his service, that they might not have time to
hearken to the temptations of the idolatrous neighbourhood they lived
in. 2. They were most of them times of joy and rejoicing. The weekly
sabbath is so, and all their yearly solemnities, except the day of
atonement. God would thus teach them that wisdom's ways are
pleasantness, and engage them to his service by encouraging them to be
cheerful in it and to sing at their work. Seven days were days of strict
rest and holy convocations; the first day and the seventh of the feast
of unleavened bread, the day of pentecost, the day of the feast of
trumpets, the first day and the eighth of the feast of tabernacles, and
the day of atonement: here were six for holy joy and one only for holy
mourning. We are commanded to rejoice evermore, but not to be evermore
weeping. Here is,

I. A repetition of the law of the passover, which was to be observed on
the fourteenth day of the first month, in remembrance of their
deliverance out of Egypt and the distinguishing preservation of their
first-born, mercies never to be forgotten. This feast was to begin with
the killing of the paschal lamb, [Lev
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#005.md). It was to continue seven days,
during all which time they were to eat sad bread, that was unleavened
([Lev 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#006).md), and the first and last
day of the seven were to be days of holy rest and holy convocations,
[Lev 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#007.md), [Lev
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#008.md). They were not idle days spent in
sport and recreation (as many that are called Christians spend their
holy days), but offerings were made by fire unto the Lord at his altar;
and we have reason to think that the people were taught to employ their
time in prayer, and praise, and godly meditation.

II\. An order for the offering of a sheaf of the first-fruits, upon the
second day of the feast of unleavened bread; the first is called the
sabbath, because it was observed as a sabbath ([Lev
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#011).md), and, on the morrow after, they
had this solemnity. A sheaf or handful of new corn was brought to the
priest, who was to heave it up, in token of his presenting it to the God
of Heaven, and to wave it to and fro before the Lord, as the Lord of the
whole earth, and this should be accepted for them as a thankful
acknowledgment of God's mercy to them in clothing their fields with
corn, and of their dependence upon God, and desire towards him, for the
preserving of it to their use. For it was the expression both of prayer
and praise, [Lev 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#011.md). A lamb for a
burnt-offering was to be offered with it, [Lev
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#012.md). As the sacrifice of animals was
generally attended with meat-offerings, so this sacrifice of corn was
attended with a burnt-offering, that bread and flesh might be set
together on God's table. They are forbidden to eat of their new corn
till this handful was offered to God; for it was fit, if God and Israel
feast together, that he should be served first. And the offering of this
sheaf of first-fruits in the name of the whole congregation did, as it
were, sanctify to them their whole harvest, and give them a comfortable
use of all the rest; for then we may eat our bread with joy when we
have, in some measure, performed our duty to God, and God has accepted
our works, for thus all our enjoyments become clean to us. Now, 1. This
law was given now, though there was no occasion for putting it in
execution till they came to Canaan: in the wilderness they sowed no
corn; but God's feeding them there with bread from heaven obliged them
hereafter not to grudge him his share of their bread out of the earth.
We find that when they came into Canaan the manna ceased upon the very
day that the sheaf of first-fruits was offered; they had eaten of the
old corn the day before ([Jos 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#011).md),
and then on this day they offered the first-fruits, by which they became
entitled to the new corn too ([Lev
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#012).md), so that there was no more
occasion for manna. 1. This sheaf of first-fruits was typical of our
Lord Jesus, who has risen from the dead as the first-fruits of those
that slept, [Co1 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020.md). That branch of
the Lord ([Isa 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002).md) was then presented
to him, in virtue of the sacrifice of himself, the Lamb of God, and it
was accepted for us. It is very observable that our Lord Jesus rose from
the dead on the very day that the first-fruits were offered, to show
that he was the substance of this shadow. 3. We are taught by this law
to honour the Lord with our substance, and with the first-fruits of all
our increase, [Pro 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#009.md). They were not
to eat of their new corn till God's part was offered to him out of it
([Lev 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#014).md), for we must always begin
with God, begin our lives with him, begin every day with him, begin
every meal with him, begin every affair and business with him; seek
first the kingdom of God.

[Leviticus 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 23:15</span></span>

Here is the institution of the feast of pentecost, or weeks, as it is
called ([Deu 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#009).md), because it was
observed fifty days, or seven weeks, after the passover. It is also
called the feast of harvest, [Exo
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#016.md). For as the presenting of the
sheaf of first-fruits was an introduction to the harvest, and gave them
liberty to put in the sickle, so they solemnized the finishing of their
corn-harvest at this feast. 1. Then they offered a handful of ears of
barley, now they offered two loaves of wheaten bread, [Lev
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#017.md). This was leavened. At the
passover they ate unleavened bread, because it was in remembrance of the
bread they ate when they came out of Egypt, which was unleavened; but
now at pentecost it was leavened, because it was an acknowledgment of
God's goodness to them in their ordinary food, which was leavened. 2.
With that sheaf of first-fruits they offered only one lamb for a
burnt-offering, but with these loaves of first-fruits they offered seven
lambs, two rams, and one bullock, all for a burnt-offering, so giving
glory to God, as the Lord of their land and the Lord of their harvest,
by whose favour they lived and to whose praise they ought to live. They
offered likewise a kid for a sin-offering, so taking shame to themselves
as unworthy of the bread they ate, and imploring pardon for their sins,
by which they had forfeited their harvest-mercies, and which they had
been guilty of in the receiving of them. And lastly, two lambs for a
sacrifice of peace-offerings, to beg a blessing upon the corn they had
gathered in, which would be neither sure nor sweet to them without that
blessing, [Hag 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#009.md). These were the
only peace-offerings that were offered on the behalf of the whole
congregation, and they were reckoned most holy offerings, whereas other
peace-offerings were but holy. All these offerings are here appointed,
[Lev 23:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#018.md). 3. That one day was to
be kept with a holy convocation, [Lev
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#021.md). It was one of the days on which
all Israel was to meet God and one another, at the place which the Lord
should choose. Some suggest that whereas seven days were to make up the
feast of unleavened bread there was only one day appointed for the feast
of pentecost, because this was a busy time of the year with them, and
God allowed them speedily to return to their work in the country. This
annual feast was instituted in remembrance of the giving of the law upon
mount Sinai, the fiftieth day after they came out of Egypt. That was the
feast which they were told in Egypt must be observed to God in the
wilderness, as a memorial of which ever after they kept this feast. But
the period and perfection of this feast was the pouring out of the
Spirit upon the apostles on the day of this feast ([Act
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001).md), in which the law of faith was
given, fifty days after Christ our passover was sacrificed for us. And
on that day (as bishop Patrick well expresses it) the apostles, having
themselves received the first-fruits of the Spirit, begat three thousand
souls, through the word of truth, and presented them, as the
first-fruits of the Christian church, to God and the Lamb.

To the institution of the feast of pentecost is annexed a repetition of
that law which we had before ([Lev
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#009).md), by which they were required to
leave the gleanings of their fields, and the corn that grew on the ends
of the butts, for the poor, [Lev
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#022.md). Probably it comes in here as a
thing which the priests must take occasion to remind the people of, when
they brought their first-fruits, intimating to them that to obey even in
this small matter was better than sacrifice, and that, unless they were
obedient, their offerings should not be accepted. It also taught them
that the joy of harvest should express itself in charity to the poor,
who must have their due out of what we have, as well as God his. Those
that are truly sensible of the mercy they receive from God will without
grudging show mercy to the poor.

[Leviticus 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 23:23</span></span>

Here is, I. The institution of the feast of trumpets, on the first day
of the seventh month, [Lev 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#024.md), [Lev
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#025.md). That which was now the seventh
month had been reckoned the first month, and the year of jubilee was
still to begin with this month ([Lev
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#008).md), so that this was their new
year's day. It was to be as their other yearly sabbaths, a day of holy
rest - You shall do no servile work therein; and a day of holy work -
You shall offer an offering to the Lord; concerning these particular
directions were afterwards given, [Num
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001.md). That which is here made peculiar
to this festival is that it was a memorial of blowing of trumpets. They
blew the trumpet every new moon ([Psa
81:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#003).md), but in the new moon of the
seventh month it was to be done with more than ordinary solemnity; for
they began to blow at sun-rise and continued till sun-set. Now, 1. This
is here said to be a memorial, perhaps of the sound of the trumpet upon
mount Sinai when the law was given, which must never be forgotten. Some
think that it was a memorial of the creation of the world, which is
supposed to have been in autumn; for which reason this was, till now,
the first month. The mighty word by which God made the world is called
the voice of his thunder ([Psa 104:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#007).md);
fitly therefore was it commemorated by blowing of trumpets, or a
memorial of shouting, as the Chaldee renders it; for, when the
foundations of the earth were fastened, all the sons of God shouted for
joy, [Job 38:6](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#006.md), [Job
38:7](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#007.md). 2. The Jewish writers suppose it
to have a spiritual signification. Now at the beginning of the year they
were called by this sound of trumpet to shake off their spiritual
drowsiness, to search and try their ways, and to amend them: the day of
atonement was the ninth day after this; and thus they were awakened to
prepare for that day, by sincere and serious repentance, that it might
be indeed to them a day of atonement. And they say, "The devout Jews
exercised themselves more in good works between the feast of trumpets
and the day of expiation than at any other time of the year." 3. It was
typical of the preaching of the gospel, by which joyful sound souls were
to be called in to serve God and keep a spiritual feast to him. The
conversion of the nations to the faith of Christ is said to be by the
blowing of a great trumpet, [Isa
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#013.md).

II\. A repetition of the law of the day of atonement, that is, so much
of it as concerned the people. 1. They must on this day rest from all
manner of work, and not only from servile works as on other annual
festivals; it must be as strict a rest as that of the weekly sabbath,
[Lev 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#028.md), [Lev
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#030.md), [Lev
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#031.md). The reason is: For it is a day
of atonement. Note, The humbling of our souls for sin, and the making of
our peace with God, is work that requires the whole man, and the closest
application of mind imaginable, and all little enough. He that would do
the work of a day of atonement in its day, as it should be done, had
need lay aside the thoughts of every thing else. On that day God spoke
peace unto his people, and unto his saints; and therefore they must lay
aside all their worldly business, that they might the more clearly and
the more reverently hear that voice of joy and gladness. Fasting days
should be days of rest. 2. They must afflict their souls, and this upon
pain of being cut off by the hand of God, [Lev
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#027.md), [Lev
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#029.md), [Lev
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#032.md). They must mortify the body, and
deny the appetites of it, in token of their sorrow for the sins they had
committed, and the mortifying of their indwelling corruptions. Every
soul must be afflicted, because every soul was polluted, and guilty
before God; while none have fulfilled the law of innocency none are
exempt from the law of repentance, besides that every man must sigh and
cry for the abominations of the land. 3. The entire day must be
observed: From even to even you shall afflict your souls ([Lev
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#032).md), that is, "You shall begin your
fast, and the expressions of your humiliation, in the ninth day of the
month at even." They were to leave off all their worldly labour, and
compose themselves to the work of the day approaching, some time before
sun-set on the ninth day, and not to take any food (except children and
sick people) till after sun-set on the tenth day. Note, The eves of
solemn days ought to be employed in solemn preparation. When work for
God and our souls is to be done, we should not straiten ourselves in
time for the doing of it; for how can we spend our time better? Of this
sabbath the rule here given is to be understood: From even unto even
shall you celebrate your sabbath.

[Leviticus 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">lev 23:33</span></span>

We have here, I. The institution of the feast of tabernacles, which was
one of the three great feasts at which all the males were bound to
attend, and celebrated with more expressions of joy than any of them.

1\. As to the directions for regulating this feast, observe, (1.) It was
to be observed on the fifteenth day of the seventh month ([Lev
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034).md), but five days after the day of
atonement. We may suppose, though they were not all bound to attend on
the day of atonement, as on the three great festivals, yet that many of
the devout Jews came up so many days before the feast of tabernacles as
to enjoy the opportunity of attending on the day of atonement. Now,
\[1.\] The afflicting of their souls on the day of atonement prepared
them for the joy of the feast of tabernacles. The more we are grieved
and humbled for sin, the better qualified we are for the comforts of the
Holy Ghost. \[2.\] The joy of this feast recompensed them for the sorrow
of that fast; for those that sow in tears shall reap in joy. (2.) It was
to continue eight days, the first and last of which were to be observed
as sabbaths, days of holy rest and holy convocations, [Lev
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#035.md), [Lev
23:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#036.md), [Lev
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#039.md). The sacrifices to be offered on
these eight days we have a very large appointment of, [Num
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#012), etc. (3..md) During the first
seven days of this feast all the people were to leave their houses, and
the women and children in them, and to dwell in booths made of the
boughs of thick trees, particularly palm trees, [Lev
23:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#040.md), [Lev
23:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#042.md). The Jews make the taking of the
branches to be a distinct ceremony from the making of the booths. It is
said, indeed ([Neh 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#015).md), that they
made their booths of the branches of trees, which they might do, and yet
use that further expression of joy, the carrying of palm-branches in
their hands, which appears to have been a token of triumph upon other
occasions ([Joh 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#013).md), and is alluded
to, [Rev 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md). The eighth day some make
a distinct feast of itself, but it is called ([Joh
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037).md) that great day of the feast; it
was the day on which they returned from their booths, to settle again in
their own houses. (4.) They were to rejoice before the Lord God during
all the time of this feast, [Lev
23:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#040.md). The tradition of the Jews is
that they were to express their joy by dancing, and singing hymns of
praise to God, with musical instruments: and not the common people only,
but the wise men of Israel, and their elders, were to do it in the court
of the sanctuary: for (say they) the joy with which a man rejoices in
doing a commandment is really a great service.

2\. As to the design of this feast,

(1.) It was to be kept in remembrance of their dwelling in tents in the
wilderness. Thus it is expounded here ([Lev
23:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#043).md): That your generations may
know, not only by the written history, but by this ocular tradition,
that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths. Thus it kept in
perpetual remembrance, \[1.\] The meanness of their beginning, and the
low and desolate state out of which God advanced that people. Note,
Those that are comfortably fixed ought often to call to mind their
former unsettled state, when they were but little in their own eyes.
\[2.\] The mercy of God to them, that, when they dwelt in tabernacles,
God not only set up a tabernacle for himself among them, but, with the
utmost care and tenderness imaginable, hung a canopy over them, even the
cloud that sheltered them from the heat of the sun. God's former mercies
to us and our fathers ought to be kept in everlasting remembrance. The
eighth day was the great day of this feast, because then they returned
to their own houses again, and remembered how, after they had long dwelt
in tents in the wilderness, at length they came to a happy settlement in
the land of promise, where they dwelt in goodly houses. And they would
the more sensibly value and be thankful for the comforts and
conveniences of their houses when they had been seven days dwelling in
booths. It is good for those that have ease and plenty sometimes to
learn what it is to endure hardness.

(2.) It was a feast of in-gathering, so it is called, [Exo
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#016.md). When they had gathered in the
fruit of their land ([Lev 23:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#039).md), the
vintage as well as the harvest, then they were to keep this feast in
thankfulness to God for all the increase of the year; and some think
that the eighth day of the feast had special reference to this ground of
the institution. Note, The joy of harvest ought to be improved for the
furtherance of our joy in God. The earth is the Lord's and the fulness
thereof, and therefore whatever we have the comfort of he must have the
glory of, especially when any mercy is perfected.

(3.) It was a typical feast. It is supposed by many that our blessed
Saviour was born much about the time of this feast; then he left his
mansions of light above to tabernacle among us ([Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014).md), and he dwelt in booths. And the
worship of God under the New Testament is prophesied of under the notion
of keeping the feast of tabernacles, [Zac
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016.md). For, \[1.\] The gospel of
Christ teaches us to dwell in tabernacles, to sit loose to this world,
as those that have here no continuing city, but by faith, and hope and
holy contempt of present things, to go out to Christ without the camp,
[Heb 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#013.md), [Heb
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#014.md). \[2.\] It teaches us to rejoice
before the Lord our God. Those are the circumcision, Israelites indeed,
that always rejoice in Christ Jesus, [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003.md). And the more we are taken off
from this world the less liable we are to the interruption of our joys.

II\. The summary and conclusion of these institutions.

1\. God appointed these feasts ([Lev
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#037.md), [Lev
23:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#038).md), besides the sabbaths and your
free-will offerings. This teaches us, (1.) That calls to extraordinary
services will not excuse us from our constant stated performances.
Within the days of the feast of tabernacles there must fall at least one
sabbath, which must be as strictly observed as any other. (2.) That
God's institutions leave room for free-will offerings. Not that we may
invent what he never instituted, but we may repeat what he has
instituted, ordinarily, the oftener the better. God is well pleased with
a willing people.

2\. Moses declared them to the children of Israel, [Lev
23:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#044.md). He let them know what God
appointed, and neither more nor less. Thus Paul delivered to the
churches what he had received from the Lord. We have reason to be
thankful that the feasts of the Lord, declared unto us, are not so
numerous, nor the observance of them so burdensome and costly, as theirs
then were, but more spiritual and significant, and surer sweeter
earnests of the everlasting feast, at the last in-gathering, which we
hope to be celebrating to eternity.
