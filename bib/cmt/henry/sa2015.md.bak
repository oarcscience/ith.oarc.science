### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 15:0</span></span>

Absalom's name signifies "the peace of his father," yet he proves his
greatest trouble; so often are we disappointed in our expectations from
the creature. The sword entailed upon David's house had hitherto been
among his children, but now it begins to be drawn against himself, with
this aggravation, that he may thank himself for it, for, had he done
justice upon the murderer, he would have prevented the traitor. The
story of Absalom's rebellion begins with this chapter, but we must go
over three or four more before we see the end of it. In this chapter we
have, I. The arts Absalom used to insinuate himself into the people's
affections ([Sa2 15:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#001).md). II. His open
avowal of his pretensions to the crown at Hebron, whither he went under
colour of a vow, and the strong party that appeared for him there ([Sa2
15:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#007).md). III. The notice brought of
this to David, and his flight from Jerusalem thereupon ([Sa2
15:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#013).md). In his flight we are told,
1. What passed between him and Ittai ([Sa2
15:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#019).md). 2. The concern of the
country for him ([Sa2 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#023).md). 3. His
conference with Zadok ([Sa2 15:24-29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#024).md).
4. His tears and prayers upon this occasion ([Sa2
15:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030).md). 5. Matters concerted by him
with Hushai ([Sa2 15:32-37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#032).md). Now the
word of God was fulfilled, that he would "raise up evil against him out
of his own house.", [Sa2 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#011.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 15:1</span></span>

Absalom is no sooner restored to his place at court than he aims to be
in the throne. He that was unhumbled under his troubles became
insufferably proud when they were over; and he cannot be content with
the honour of being the king's son, and the prospect of being his
successor, but he must be king now. His mother was a king's daughter; on
that perhaps he valued himself, and despised his father, who was but the
son of Jesse. She was the daughter of a heathen king, which made him the
less concerned for the peace of Israel. David, in this unhappy issue of
that marriage, smarted for his being unequally yoked with an unbeliever.
When Absalom was restored to the king's favour, if he had had any sense
of gratitude, he would have studied how to oblige his father, and make
him easy; but, on the contrary, he meditates how to undermine him, by
stealing the hearts of the people from him. Two things recommend a man
to popular esteem - greatness and goodness.

I. Absalom looks great, [Sa2 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#001.md). He
had learned of the king of Geshur (what was not allowed to the kings of
Israel) to multiply horses, which made him look desirable, while his
father, on his mule, looked despicable. The people desired a king like
the nations; and such a one Absalom will be, appearing in pomp and
magnificence, above what had been seen in Jerusalem. Samuel had foretold
that this would be the manner of the king: He shall have chariots and
horsemen, and some shall run before his chariots ([Sa1
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#011).md); and this is Absalom's manner.
Fifty footmen (in rich liveries we may suppose) running before him, to
give notice of his approach, would highly gratify his pride and the
people's foolish fancy. David thinks that this parade is designed only
to grace his court, and connives at it. Those parents know not what they
do who indulge a proud humour in their children; for I have seen more
young people ruined by pride than by any one lust whatsoever.

II\. Absalom will seem very good too, but with a very bad design. Had he
proved himself a good son and a good subject, and set himself to serve
his father's interest, he would have done his present duty, and shown
himself worthy of future honours, after his father's death. Those that
know how to obey well know how to rule. But to show how good a judge and
how good a king he will be is but to deceive himself and others. Those
are good indeed that are good in their own place, not that pretend how
good they would be in other people's places. But this is all the
goodness we find in Absalom.

1\. He wishes that he were a judge in Israel, [Sa2
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#004.md). He had all the pomp and all the
pleasure he could wish, lived as great and in as much ease as any man
could; yet this will not content him, unless he have power too: O that I
were a judge in Israel! He that should himself have been judged to death
for murder has the impudence to aim at being a judge of others. We read
not of Absalom's wisdom, virtue, or learning in the laws, nor had he
given any proofs of his love to justice, but the contrary; yet he wishes
he were judge. Note, Those are commonly most ambitious of preferment
that are least fit for it; the best qualified are the most modest and
self-diffident, while it is no better than the spirit of an Absalom that
says, O that I were a judge in Israel!

2\. He takes a very bad course for the accomplishing of his wish. Had he
humbly petitioned his father to employ him in the administration of
justice, and studied to qualify himself for it (according to the rule,
[Exo 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#021).md), no doubt he would have
been sure of the next judge's place that fell; but this is too mean a
post for his proud spirit. It is below him to be subordinate, though to
the king his father; he must be supreme or nothing. He wants to be such
a judge that every man who has any cause shall come to him: in all
causes, and over all persons, he must preside, little thinking what a
fatigue this would be to have every man come to him. Moses himself could
not bear it. Those know not what power is that grasp at so much, so very
much. To gain the power he aims at, he endeavours to instil into the
people's minds,

(1.) A bad opinion of the present administration, as if the affairs of
the kingdom were altogether neglected, and no care taken about them. He
got round him all he could that had business at the council-board,
enquired what their business was; and, \[1.\] Upon a slight and general
enquiry into their cause, he pronounced it good: Thy matters are right.
A fit man indeed to be a judge, who would give judgment upon hearing one
side only! For he has a bad cause indeed that cannot put a good colour
upon it, when he himself has the telling of the story. But, \[2.\] He
told them that it was to no purpose to appeal to the throne: "There is
no man deputed of the king to hear thee. The king is himself old, and
past business, or so taken up with his devotions that he never minds
business; his sons are so addicted to their pleasures that, though they
have the name of chief rulers, they take no care of the affairs
committed to them." He further seems to insinuate what a great want
there was of him while he was banished and confined, and how much the
public suffered by his exile; what his father said truly in Saul's reign
([Psa 75:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#003).md) he says falsely: The land
and all the inhabitants of it are dissolved, all will go to wreck and
ruin, unless I bear up the pillars of it. Every appellant shall be made
to believe that he will never have justice done him, unless Absalom be
viceroy or lord-justice. It is the way of turbulent, factious, aspiring
men, to reproach the government they are under. Presumptuous are they,
self-willed, and not afraid to speak evil of dignities, [Pe2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#010.md). Even David himself, the best of
kings, and his administration, could not escape the worst of censures.
Those that aim to usurp cry out of grievances, and pretend to design
nothing but the redress of them: as Absalom here.

(2.) A good opinion of his own fitness to rule. That the people might
say, "O that Absalom were a judge!" (and they are apt enough to desire
changes), he recommends himself to them, \[1.\] As very diligent. He
rose up early, and appeared in public before the rest of the king's sons
were stirring, and he stood beside the way of the gate, where the courts
of judgment sat, as one mightily concerned to see justice done and
public business despatched. \[2.\] As very inquisitive and prying, and
desirous to be acquainted with every one's case. He would know of what
city every one was that came for judgment, that he might inform himself
concerning every part of the kingdom and the state of it, [Sa2
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#002.md). \[3.\] As very familiar and
humble. If any Israelite offered to do obeisance to him he took him and
embraced him as a friend. No man's conduct could be more condescending,
while his heart was as proud as Lucifer's. Ambitious projects are often
carried on by a show of humility, [Col
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023.md). He knew what a grace it puts
upon greatness to be affable and courteous, and how much it wins upon
common people: had he been sincere in it, it would have been his praise;
but to fawn upon the people that he might betray them was abominable
hypocrisy. He croucheth, and humbleth himself, to draw them into his
net, [Psa 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#009.md), [Psa
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#010.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 15:7</span></span>

We have here the breaking out of Absalom's rebellion, which he had long
been contriving. It is said to be after forty years, [Sa2
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#007.md). But whence it is to be dated we
are not told; not from David's beginning his reign, for then it would
fall in the last year of his life, which is not probable; but either
from his first anointing by Samuel seven years before, or rather (I
think) from the people's desiring a king, and the first change of the
government into a monarchy, which might be about ten years before David
began to reign; it is fitly dated thence, to show that the same restless
spirit was still working, and still they were given to change: as fond
now of a new man as then of a new model. So it fell about the thirtieth
year of David's reign. Absalom's plot being now ripe for execution,

I. The place he chose for the rendezvous of his party was Hebron, the
place where he was born and where his father began his reign and
continued it several years, which would give some advantage to his
pretensions. Every one knew Hebron to be a royal city; and it lay in the
heart of Judah's lot, in which tribe, probably, he thought his interest
strong.

II\. The pretence he had both to go thither and to invite his friends to
him there was to offer a sacrifice to God, in performance of a vow he
had made during his banishment, [Sa2
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#007.md), [Sa2
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#008.md). We have cause enough to suspect
that he had not made any such vow; it does not appear that he was so
religiously inclined. But he that stuck not at murder and treason would
not make conscience of a lie to serve his purpose. If he said he had
made such a vow, nobody could disprove him. Under this pretence, 1. He
got leave of his father to go to Hebron. David would be well pleased to
hear that his son, in his exile, was so desirous to return to Jerusalem,
not only his father's city, but the city of the living God, - that he
looked up to God, to bring him back, - that he had vowed, if he were
brought back, to serve the Lord, whose service he had hitherto
neglected, - and that now, being brought back, he remembered his vow,
and resolved to perform it. If he think fit to do it in Hebron, rather
than in Sion or Gibeon, the good king is so well pleased with the thing
itself that he will not object against his choice of the place. See how
willing tender parents are to believe the best concerning their
children, and, upon the least indication of good, to hope, even
concerning those that have been untoward, that they will repent and
reform. But how easy is it for children to take advantage of their good
parents' credulity, and to impose upon them with the show of religion,
while still they are what they were! David was overjoyed to hear that
Absalom inclined to serve the Lord, and therefore readily gave him leave
to go to Hebron, and to go thither with solemnity. 2. He got a good
number of sober substantial citizens to go along with him, [Sa2
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#011.md). There went 200 men, probably of
the principal men of Jerusalem, whom he invited to join with him in his
feast upon his sacrifice; and they went in their simplicity, not in the
least suspecting that Absalom had any bad design in this journey. He
knew that it was to no purpose to tempt them into his plot: they were
inviolably firm to David. But he drew them in to accompany him, that the
common people might think that they were in his interest, and that David
was deserted by some of his best friends. Note, It is no new thing for
very good men, and very good things, to be made use of by designing men
to put a colour upon bad practices. When religion is made a
stalking-horse, and sacrifice a shoeing-horn, to sedition and usurpation
it is not to be wondered at if some that were well affected to religion,
as these followers of Absalom here, are imposed upon by the fallacy, and
drawn in to give countenance to that, with their names, which in their
heart they abhor, not having known the depths of Satan.

III\. The project he laid was to get himself proclaimed king throughout
all the tribes of Israel upon a signal given, [Sa2
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#010.md). Spies were sent abroad, to be
ready in every country to receive the notice with satisfaction and
acclamations of joy, and to make the people believe that the news was
both very true and very good, and that they were all concerned to take
up arms for their new king. Upon the sudden spreading of this
proclamation, "Absalom reigns in Hebron," some would conclude that David
was dead, others that he had resigned: and thus those that were in the
secret would draw in many to appear for Absalom, and to come into his
assistance, who, if they had rightly understood the matter, would have
abhorred the thought of it, but, being drawn in, would adhere to him.
See what artifices ambitious men use for the compassing of their ends;
and in matters of state, as well as in matters of religion, let us not
be forward to believe every spirit, but try the spirits.

IV\. The person he especially courted and relied upon in this affair was
Ahithophel, a politic thinking man, and one that had a clear head and a
great compass of thought, that had been David's counsellor, his guide
and his acquaintance ([Psa 55:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#013).md), his
familiar friend, in whom he trusted, who did eat of his bread, [Psa
41:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#009.md). But, upon some disgust of
David's against him, or his against David, he was banished, or retired
from public business, and lived privately in the country. How should a
man of such good principles as David, and a man of such corrupt
principles as Ahithophel, long agree? A fitter tool Absalom could not
find in all the kingdom than one that was so great a statesman, and yet
was disaffected to the present ministry. While Absalom was offering his
sacrifices, in performance of his pretended vow, he sent for this man.
So much was his heart on the projects of his ambition that he could not
stay to make an end of his devotion, which showed what his eye was upon
in all, and that it was but for a pretence that he made long offerings.

V. The party that joined with him proved at last very considerable. The
people increased continually with Absalom, which made the conspiracy
strong and formidable. Every one whom he had complimented and caressed
(pronouncing his matters right and good, especially if afterwards the
cause went against him) not only came himself, but made all the interest
he could for him, so that he wanted not for numbers. The majority is no
certain rule to judge of equity by. All the world wondered after the
beast. Whether Absalom formed this design merely in the height of his
ambition and fondness to rule, or whether there was not in it also
malice against his father and revenge for his banishment and
confinement, though this punishment was so much less than he deserved,
does not appear. But, generally, that which aims at the crown aims at
the head that wears it.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 15:13</span></span>

Here is, I. The notice brought to David of Absalom's rebellion, [Sa2
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#013.md). The matter was bad enough, and
yet it seems to have been made worse to him (as such things commonly
are) than really it was; for he was told that the hearts of the men of
Israel (that is, the generality of them, at least the leading men) were
after Absalom. But David was the more apt to believe it because now he
could call to mind the arts that Absalom had used to inveigle them, and
perhaps reflected upon it with regret that he had not done more to
counterwork him, and secure his own interest, which he had been too
confident of. Note, It is the wisdom of princes to make sure of their
subjects; for, if they have them, they have their purses, and arms, and
all, at their service.

II\. The alarm this gave to David, and the resolutions he came to
thereupon. We may well imagine him in a manner thunderstruck, when he
heard that the son he loved so dearly, and had been so indulgent to, was
so unnaturally and ungratefully in arms against him. Well might he say
with Caesar, Kai su teknon - What, thou my son? Let not parents raise
their hopes too high from their children, lest they be disappointed.
David did not call a council, but, consulting only with God and his own
heart, determined immediately to quit Jerusalem, [Sa2
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#014.md). He took up this strange
resolve, so disagreeable to his character as a man of courage, either,
1. As a penitent, submitting to the rod, and lying down under God's
correcting hand. Conscience now reminded him of his sin in the matter of
Uriah, and the sentence he was under for it, which was that evil should
arise against him out of his own house. "Now," thinks he, "the word of
God begins to be fulfilled, and it is not for me to contend with it or
fight against it; God is righteous and I submit." Before unrighteous
Absalom he could justify himself and stand it out; but before the
righteous God he must condemn himself and yield to his judgments. Thus
he accepts the punishment of his iniquity. Or, 2. As a politician.
Jerusalem was a great city, but not tenable; it should seem, by David's
prayer ([Psa 51:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#018).md), that the walls of
it were not built up, much less was it regularly fortified. It was too
large to be garrisoned by so small a force as David had now with him, He
had reason to fear that the generality of the inhabitants were too well
affected to Absalom to be true to him. Should he fortify himself here,
he might lose the country, in which, especially among those that lay
furthest from Absalom's tampering, he hoped to have the most friends.
And he had such a kindness for Jerusalem that he was loth to make it the
seat of war, and expose it to the calamities of a siege; he will rather
quit it tamely to the rebels. Note, Good men, when they suffer
themselves, care not how few are involved with them in suffering.

III\. His hasty flight from Jerusalem. His servants agreed to the
measures he took, faithfully adhered to him ([Sa2
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#015).md), and assured him of their
inviolable allegiance, whereupon, 1. He went out of Jerusalem himself on
foot, while his son Absalom had chariots and horses. It is not always
the best man, nor the best cause, that makes the best figure. See here,
not only the servant, but the traitor, on horseback, while the prince,
the rightful prince, walks as a servant upon the earth, [Ecc
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#007.md). Thus he chose to do, to abase
himself so much the more under God's hand, and in condescension to his
friends and followers, with whom he would walk, in token that he would
live and die with them. 2. He took his household with him, his wives and
children, that he might protect them in this day of danger, and that
they might be a comfort to him in this day of grief. Masters of
families, in their greatest frights, must not neglect their households.
Ten women, that were concubines, he left behind, to keep the house,
thinking that the weakness of their sex would secure them from murder,
and their age and relation to him would secure them from rape; but God
overruled this for the fulfilling of his word. 3. He took his life-guard
with him, or band of pensioners, the Cherethites and Pelethites, who
were under the command of Benaiah, and the Gittites, who were under the
command of Ittai, [Sa2 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#018.md). These
Gittites seem to have been, by birth, Philistines of Gath, who came, a
regiment of them, 600 in all, to enter themselves in David's service,
having known him at Gath, and being greatly in love with him for his
virtue and piety, and having embraced the Jews' religion. David made
them of his garde du corps - his body-guard, and they adhered to him in
his distress. The Son of David found not such great faith in Israel as
in a Roman centurion and a woman of Canaan. 4. As many as would, of the
people of Jerusalem, he took with him, and made a halt at some distance
from the city, to draw them up, [Sa2
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#017.md). He compelled none. Those whose
hearts were with Absalom, to Absalom let them go, and so shall their
doom be: they will soon have enough of him. Christ enlists none but
volunteers.

IV\. His discourse with Ittai the Gittite, who commanded the
Philistine-proselytes.

1\. David dissuaded him from going along with him, [Sa2
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#019.md), [Sa2
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#020.md). Though he and his men might be
greatly serviceable to him yet, (1.) He would try whether he was hearty
for him, and not inclined to Absalom. He therefore bids him return to
his post in Jerusalem, and serve the new king. If he was no more than a
soldier of fortune (as we say), he would be for that side which would
pay and prefer him best; and to that side let him go. (2.) If he was
faithful to David, yet David would not have him exposed to the fatigues
and perils he now counted upon. David's tender spirit cannot bear to
think that a stranger and an exile, a proselyte and a new convert, who
ought, by all means possible, to be encouraged and made easy, should, at
his first coming, meet with such hard usage: "Should I make thee go up
and down with us? No, return with thy brethren." Generous souls are more
concerned at the share others have in their troubles than at their own.
Ittai shall therefore be dismissed with a blessing: Mercy and truth be
with thee, that is, God's mercy and truth, mercy according to promise,
the promise made to those who renounce other gods and put themselves
under the wings off the divine Majesty. This is a very proper pious
farewell, when we part with a friend, "Mercy and truth be with thee, and
then thou art safe, and mayest be easy, wherever thou art." David's
dependence was upon the mercy and truth of God for comfort and
happiness, both for himself and his friends; see [Psa
61:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#007.md).

2\. Ittai bravely resolved not to leave him, [Sa2
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#021.md). Where David is, whether in life
or death, safe or in peril, there will this faithful friend of his be;
and he confirms this resolution with an oath, that he might not be
tempted to break it. Such a value has he for David, not for the sake of
his wealth and greatness (for then he would have deserted him now that
he saw him thus reduced), but for the sake of his wisdom and goodness,
which were still the same, that, whatever comes of it, he will never
leave him. Note, That is a friend indeed who loves at all times, and
will adhere to us in adversity. Thus should we cleave to the Son of
David with full purpose of heart that neither life nor death shall
separate us from his love.

V. The common people's sympathy with David in his affliction. When he
and his attendants passed over the brook Kidron (the very same brook
that Christ passed over when he entered upon his sufferings, [Joh
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#001).md), towards the way of the
wilderness, which lay between Jerusalem and Jericho, all the country
wept with a loud voice, [Sa2 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#023.md).
Cause enough there was for weeping, 1. To see a prince thus reduced, one
that had lived so great forced from his palace and in fear of his life,
with a small retinue seeking shelter in a desert, to see the city of
David, which he himself won, built, and fortified, made an unsafe abode
for David himself. It would move the compassion even of strangers to see
a man fallen thus low from such a height, and this by the wickedness of
his own son; a piteous case it was. Parents that are abused and ruined
by their own children merit the tender sympathy of their friends as much
as any of the sons or daughters of affliction. Especially, 2. To see
their own prince thus wronged, who had been so great a blessing to their
land, and had not done any thing to forfeit the affections of his
people; to see him in this distress, and themselves unable to help him,
might well draw floods of tears from their eyes.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 15:24</span></span>

Here we have, I. The fidelity of the priests and Levites and their firm
adherence to David and his interest. They knew David's great affection
to them and their office, notwithstanding his failings. The method
Absalom took to gain people's affections made no impression upon them;
he had little religion in him, and therefore they steadily adhered to
David. Zadok and Abiathar, and all the Levites, if he go, will accompany
him, and take the ark with them, that, by it, they may ask counsel of
God for him, [Sa2 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#024.md). Note, Those
that are friends to the ark in their prosperity will find it a friend to
them in their adversity. Formerly David would not rest till he had found
a resting-place for the ark; and now, if the priests may have their
mind, the ark shall not rest till David return to his rest.

II\. David's dismission of them back into the city, [Sa2
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#025.md), [Sa2
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#026.md). Abiathar was high priest ([Kg1
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#035).md), but Zadok was his assistant,
and attended the ark most closely, while Abiathar was active in public
business, [Sa2 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#024.md). Therefore David
directs his speech to Zadok, and an excellent speech it is, and shows
him to be in a very good frame under his affliction, and that still he
holds fast his integrity. 1. He is very solicitous for the safety of the
ark: "By all means carry the ark back into the city, let not that be
unsettled and exposed with me, lodge that again in the tent pitched for
it; surely Absalom, bad as he is, will do that no harm." David's heart,
like Eli's trembles for the ark of God. Note, It argues a good principle
to be more concerned for the church's prosperity than for our own, to
prefer Jerusalem before our chief joy ([Psa
137:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#006).md), the success of the gospel, and
the flourishing of the church, above our own wealth, credit, ease, and
safety, even when they are most in hazard. 2. He is very desirous to
return to the enjoyment of the privileges of God's house. He will reckon
it the greatest instance of God's favour to him if he may but once more
be brought back to see it and his habitation. This will be more his joy
than to be brought back to his own palace and throne again. Note,
Gracious souls measure their comforts and conveniences in this world by
the opportunity they give them of communion with God. Hezekiah wished
for the recovery of his health for this reason, that he might go up to
the house of the Lord, [Isa 38:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#022.md). 3.
He is very submissive to the holy will of God concerning the issue of
this dark dispensation. He hopes the best ([Sa2
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#025).md), and hopes for it from the
favour of God, which he looks upon to be the fountain of all good: "If
God favour me so far, I shall be settled again as formerly." But he
provides for the worst: "If he deny me this favour - if he thus say, I
have no delight in thee - I know I deserve the continuance of his
displeasure; his holy will be done." See him here patiently awaiting the
event: "Behold, here am I, as a servant expecting orders;" and see him
willing to commit himself to God concerning it: "Let him do to me as
seemeth good to him. I have nothing to object. All is well that God
does." Observe with what satisfaction and holy complacency he speaks of
the divine disposal: not only, "He can do what he will," subscribing to
his power ([Job 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#012).md), or, "He has a
right to do what he will," subscribing to his sovereignty ([Job
33:13](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#013).md), or, "He will do what he will,"
subscribing to his unchangeableness ([Job
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#013.md), [Job
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#015).md), but, "Let him to what he
will," subscribing to his wisdom and goodness. Note, It is our interest,
as well as duty, cheerfully to acquiesce in the will of God, whatever
befals us. That we may not complain of what is, let us see God's hand in
all events; and, that we may not be afraid of what shall be, let us see
all events in God's hand.

III\. The confidence David put in the priests that they would serve his
interest to the utmost of their power in his absence. He calls Zadok a
seer ([Sa2 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#027).md), that is, a wise
man, a man that can see into business and discern time and judgment:
"Thou hast thy eyes in thy head ([Ecc
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#014).md), and therefore art capable of
doing me service, especially by sending me intelligence of the enemy's
motions and resolutions." One friend that is a seer, in such an exigency
as this, was worth twenty that were not so quick-sighted. For the
settling of a private correspondence with the priests in his absence, he
appoints, 1. Whom they should send to him - their two sons, Ahimaaz and
Jonathan, whose coat, it might be hoped, would be their protection, and
of whose prudence and faithfulness he had probably had experience. 2.
Whither they should send. He would encamp in the plain of the wilderness
till he heard from them ([Sa2 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#028).md),
and then would move according to the information and advice they should
send him. Hereupon they returned to the city, to await the event. It was
a pity that any disturbance should be given to a state so happy as this
was, when the prince and the priests had such an entire affection for
the confidence in each other.

IV\. The melancholy posture that David and his men put themselves into,
when, at the beginning of their march, they went up the mount of Olives,
[Sa2 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030.md).

1\. David himself, as a deep mourner, covered his head and face for
shame and blushing, went bare-foot, as a prisoner or a slave, for
mortification, and went weeping. Did it become a man of his reputation
for courage and greatness of spirit thus to cry like a child, only for
fear of an enemy at a distance, against whom he might easily have made
head, and perhaps with one bold stroke have routed him? Yes, it did not
ill become him, considering how much there was in this trouble, (1.) Of
the unkindness of his son. He could not but weep to think that one who
came out of his bowels, and had so often lain in his arms, should thus
lift up the heel against him. God himself is said to be grieved with the
rebellions of his own children ([Psa
95:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#010).md) and even broken with their
whorish heart, [Eze 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#009). (2..md) There
was much of the displeasure of his God in it. This infused the wormwood
and gall into the affliction and misery, [Lam
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#019.md). His sin was ever before him
([Psa 51:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#003).md), but never so plain nor
ever appearing so black as now. He never wept thus when Saul hunted him:
but a wounded conscience makes troubles lie heavily, [Psa
38:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#004.md).

2\. When David wept all his company wept likewise, being much affected
with his grief and willing to share in it. It is our duty to weep with
those that weep, especially our superiors, and those that are better
than we; for, if this be done in the green tree, what will be done in
the dry? We must weep with those that weep for sin. When Hezekiah
humbled himself for his sin all Jerusalem joined with him, [Ch2
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#026.md). To prevent suffering with
sinners, let us sorrow with them.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa2 15:31</span></span>

Nothing, it seems, appeared to David more threatening in Absalom's plot
than that Ahithophel was in it; for one good head, in such a design, is
worth a thousand good hands. Absalom was himself no politician, but he
had got one entirely in his interest that was, and would be the more
dangerous because he had been all along acquainted with David's counsels
and affairs; if therefore he can be baffled, Absalom is as good as
routed and the head of the conspiracy cut off. This David endeavours to
do.

I. By prayer. When he heard that Ahithophel was in the plot he lifted up
his heart to God in this short prayer: Lord, turn the counsel of
Ahithophel into foolishness, [Sa2
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#031.md). He had not opportunity for a
long prayer, but he was not one of those that thought he should be heard
for his much speaking. It was a fervent prayer: "Lord, I pray thee, do
this." God is well pleased with the importunity of those that come to
him with their petitions. David is particular in this prayer; he names
the person whose counsels he prays against. God gives us leave, in
prayer, to be humbly and reverently free with him, and to mention the
particular care, and fear, and grief, that lies heavily upon us. David
prayed not against Ahithophel's person, but against his counsel, that
God would turn it into foolishness, that, though he was a wise man, he
might at this time give foolish counsel, or, if he gave wise counsel,
that it might be rejected as foolish, or, if it were followed, that by
some providence or other it might be defeated, and not attain the end.
David prayed this in a firm belief that God has all hearts in his hand,
and tongues too, that, when he pleases, he can take away the
understanding of the aged and make the judges fools, ([Job
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#017.md); [Isa
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#002.md), [Isa
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#003).md), and in hope that God would own
and plead his just and injured cause. Note, We may pray in faith, and
should pray with fervency, that God will turn that counsel into
foolishness which is taken against his people.

II\. By policy. We must second our prayer with our endeavours, else we
tempt God. It is good service to countermine the policy of the church's
enemies. When David came to the top of the mount, he worshipped God,
[Sa2 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#032.md). Note, Weeping must not
hinder worshipping, but quicken it rather. Now he penned the third
Psalm, as appears by the title; and some think that his singing this was
the worship he now paid to God. Just now Providence brought Hushai to
him. While he was yet speaking, God heard, and sent him the person that
should be instrumental to befool Ahithophel. He came to condole with
David on his present trouble, with his coat rent and earth upon his
head; but David, having a great deal of confidence in his conduct and
faithfulness, resolved to employ him as a spy upon Absalom. He would not
take him with him ([Sa2 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#033).md), for he
had now more need of soldiers than counsellors, but sent him back to
Jerusalem, to wait for Absalom's arrival, as a deserter from David, and
to offer him his service, [Sa2 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#034.md).
Thus he might insinuate himself into his counsels, and defeat
Ahithophel, either by dissuading Absalom from following his advice or by
discovering it to David, that he might know where to stand upon his
guard. How this gross dissimulation, which David put Hushai upon, can be
justified, as a stratagem in war, I do not see. The best that can be
made of it is that Absalom, if he rebel against his father, must stand
upon his guard against all mankind, and, if he will be deceived, let him
be deceived. David recommended Hushai to Zadok and Abiathar, as persons
proper to be consulted with ([Sa2
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#035).md), and to their two sons, as
trusty men to be sent on errands to David, [Sa2
15:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#036.md). Hushai, thus instructed, came
to Jerusalem ([Sa2 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#037).md), whither
also Absalom soon after came with his forces. How soon do royal palaces
and royal cities change their masters! But we look for a kingdom which
cannot be thus shaken and in the possession of which we cannot be
disturbed.
