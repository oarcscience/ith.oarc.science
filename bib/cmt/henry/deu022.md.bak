### [Deuteronomy Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 22:0</span></span>

The laws of this chapter provide, I. For the preservation of charity and
good neighbourship, in the care of strayed or fallen cattle ([Deu
22:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#001).md). II. For the preservation of
order and distinction, that men and women should not wear one another's
clothes ([Deu 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#005).md), and that other
needless mixtures should be avoided ([Deu
22:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#009).md). III. For the preservation of
birds ([Deu 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#006.md), [Deu
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#007).md). IV. Of life ([Deu
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#008).md). V. Of the commandments ([Deu
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#012).md). VI. Of the reputation of a
wife abused, if she were innocent ([Deu
22:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#013).md), but for her punishment if
guilty ([Deu 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#020.md), [Deu
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#021).md). VII. For the preservation of
the chastity of wives ([Deu 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#022).md).
Virgins betrothed ([Deu 22:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#023).md), or
not betrothed ([Deu 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#028.md), [Deu
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#029).md). And, lastly, against incest
([Deu 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#030).md).

[Deuteronomy 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 22:1</span></span>

The kindness that was commanded to be shown in reference to an enemy
([Exo 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#004), etc..md) is here required to
be much more done for a neighbour, though he were not an Israelite, for
the law is consonant to natural equity. 1. That strayed cattle should be
brought back, either to the owner or to the pasture out of which they
had gone astray, [Deu 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#001.md), [Deu
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#002.md). This must be done in pity to the
very cattle, which, while they wandered, were exposed; and in civility
and respect to the owner, nay, and in justice to him, for it was doing
as we would be done by, which is one of the fundamental laws of equity.
Note, Religion teaches us to be neighbourly, and to be ready to do all
good offices, as we have opportunity, to all men. In doing this, (1.)
They must not mind trouble, but, if they knew who the owner was, must
take it back themselves; for, if they should only send notice to the
owner to come and look after it himself, some mischief might befal it
ere he could reach it. (2.) They must not mind expense, but, if they
knew not who the owner was, must take it home and feed it till the owner
was found. If such care must be taken of a neighbour's ox or ass going
astray, much more of himself going astray from God and his duty; we
should do our utmost to convert him ([Jam
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#019).md), and restore him, considering
ourselves, [Gal 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001.md). 2. That lost
goods should be brought to the owner, [Deu
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#003.md). The Jews say, "He that found the
lost goods was to give public notice of them by the common crier three
or four times," according to the usage with us; if the owner could not
be found, he that found the goods might convert them to his own use; but
(say some learned writers in this case) he would do very well to give
the value of the goods to the poor. 3. That cattle in distress should be
helped, [Deu 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#004.md). This must be done
both in compassion to the brute-creatures (for a merciful man regardeth
the life of a beast, though it be not his own) and in love and
friendship to our neighbour, not knowing how soon we may have occasion
for his help. If one member may say to another, "I have at present no
need of thee," it cannot say, "I never shall."

[Deuteronomy 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 22:5</span></span>

Here are several laws in these verses which seem to stoop very low, and
to take cognizance of things mean and minute. Men's laws commonly do not
so: De minimis non curat lex - The law takes no cognizance of little
things; but because God's providence extends itself to the smallest
affairs, his precepts do so, that even in them we may be in the fear of
the Lord, as we are under his eye and care. And yet the significancy and
tendency of these statutes, which seem little, are such that,
notwithstanding their minuteness, being fond among the things of God's
law, which he has written to us, they are to be accounted great things.

I. The distinction of sexes by the apparel is to be kept up, for the
preservation of our own and our neighbour's chastity, [Deu
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#005.md). Nature itself teaches that a
difference be made between them in their hair ([Co1
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#014).md), and by the same rule in their
clothes, which therefore ought not to be confounded, either in ordinary
wear or occasionally. To befriend a lawful escape or concealment it may
be done, but whether for sport or in the acting of plays is justly
questionable. 1. Some think it refers to the idolatrous custom of the
Gentiles: in the worship of Venus, women appeared in armour, and men in
women's clothes; this, as other such superstitious usages, is here said
to be an abomination to the Lord. 2. It forbids the confounding of the
dispositions and affairs of the sexes: men must not be effeminate, nor
do the women's work in the house, nor must women be viragos, pretend to
teach, or usurp authority, [Ti1 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#011.md),
[Ti1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#012.md). Probably this confounding
of garments had been used to gain opportunity of committing uncleanness,
and is therefore forbidden; for those that would be kept from sin must
keep themselves from all occasions of it and approaches to it.

II\. In taking a bird's-nest, the dam must be let go, [Deu
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#006.md), [Deu
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#007.md). The Jews say, "This is the least
of all the commandments of the law of Moses," and yet the same promise
is here made to the observance of it that is made to the keeping of the
fifth commandment, which is one of the greatest, that it may be well
with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days; for, as disobedience
in a small matter shows a very great contempt of the law, so obedience
in a small matter shows a very great regard to it. He that let go a bird
out of his hand (which was worth two in the bush) purely because God
bade him, in that made it to appear that he esteemed all God's precepts
concerning all things to be right, and that he could deny himself rather
than sin against God. But doth God take care for birds? [Co1
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009.md). Yes, certainly; and perhaps to
this law our Saviour alludes. [Luk
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#006.md), Are not five sparrows sold for
two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God? This law, 1.
Forbids us to be cruel to the brute-creatures, or to take a pleasure in
destroying them. Though God has made us wiser than the fowls of heaven,
and given us dominion over them, yet we must not abuse them nor rule
them with rigour. Let go the dam to breed again; destroy it not, for a
blessing is in it, [Isa 65:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#008.md). 2. It
teaches us compassion to those of our own kind, and to abhor the thought
of every thing that looks barbarous, and cruel, and ill-natured,
especially towards those of the weaker and tender sex, which always
ought to be treated with the utmost respect, in consideration of the
sorrows wherein they bring forth children. It is spoken of as an
instance of the most inhuman cruelty that the mother was dashed to
pieces upon her children ([Hos 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014).md),
and that the women with child were ripped open, [Amo
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013.md). 3. It further intimates that we
must not take advantage against any, from their natural affection and
the tenderness of their disposition, to do them an injury. The dam could
not have been taken if her concern for her eggs or young (unlike to the
ostrich) had not detained her upon the next when otherwise she could
easily have secured herself by flight. Now, since it is a thousand
pities that she should fare the worse for that which is her praise, the
law takes care that she shall be let go. The remembrance of this may
perhaps, some time or other, keep us from doing a hard or unkind thing
to those whom we have at our mercy.

III\. In building a house, care must be taken to make it safe, that none
might receive mischief by falling from it, [Deu
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#008.md). The roofs of their houses were
flat for people to walk on, as appears by many scriptures; now lest any,
through carelessness, should fall off them, they must compass them with
battlements, which (the Jews say) must be three feet and a half high; if
this were not done, and mischief followed, the owner, by his neglect,
brought the guilt of blood upon his house. See here, 1. How precious
men's lives are to God, who protects them, not only by his providence,
but by his law. 2. How precious, therefore, they ought to be to us, and
what care we should take to prevent hurt from coming to any person. The
Jews say that by the equity of this law they were obliged (and so are we
too) to fence, or remove, every thing by which life may be endangered,
as to cover draw-wells, keep bridges in repair, and the like, lest, if
any perish through our omission, their blood be required at our hand.

IV\. Odd mixtures are here forbidden, [Deu
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#009.md), [Deu
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#010.md). Much of this we met with
before, [Lev 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#019.md). There appears not
any thing at all of moral evil in these things, and therefore we now
make no conscience of sowing wheat and rye together, ploughing with
horses and oxen together, and of wearing linsey-woolsey garments; but
hereby is forbidden either, 1. A conformity to some idolatrous customs
of the heathen. Or, 2. That which is contrary to the plainness and
purity of an Israelite. They must not gratify their own vanity and
curiosity by putting those things together which the Creator in infinite
wisdom had made asunder: they must not be unequally yoked with
unbelievers, nor mingle themselves with the unclean, as an ox with an
ass. Nor must their profession and appearance in the world be motley, or
party-coloured, but all of a piece, all of a kind.

V. The law concerning fringes upon their garments, and memorandums of
the commandments, which we had before ([Num
15:38](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#038.md), [Num
15:39](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#039).md), is here repeated, [Deu
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#012.md). By these they were
distinguished from other people, so that it might be said, upon the
first sight There goes an Israelite, which taught them not to be ashamed
of their country, nor the peculiarities of their religion, how much
soever their neighbours looked upon them and it with contempt: and they
were also put in mind of the precepts upon the particular occasions to
which they had reference; and perhaps this law is repeated here because
the precepts immediately foregoing seemed so minute that they were in
danger of being overlooked and forgotten. The fringes will remind you
not to make your garments of linen and woollen, [Deu
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#011.md).

[Deuteronomy 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 22:13</span></span>

These laws relate to the seventh commandment, laying a restraint by
laying a penalty upon those fleshly lusts which war against the soul.

I. If a man, lusting after another woman, to get rid of his wife slander
her and falsely accuse her, as not having the virginity she pretended to
when he married her, upon the disproof of his slander he must be
punished, [Deu 22:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#013.md). What the
meaning of that evidence is by which the husband's accusation was to be
proved false the learned are not agreed, nor is it at all necessary to
enquire - those for whom this law was intended, no doubt, understood it:
it is sufficient for us to know that this wicked husband, who had thus
endeavoured to ruin the reputation of his own wife, was to be scourged,
and fined, and bound out from ever divorcing the wife he had thus
abused, [Deu 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#018.md), [Deu
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#019.md). Upon his dislike of her he
might have divorced her if he had pleased, by the permission of the law
([Deu 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001).md), but then he must have
given her her dowry: if therefore to save that, and to do her the
greater mischief, he would thus destroy her good name, it was fit that
he should be severely punished for it, and for ever after forfeit the
permission to divorce her. Observe, 1. The nearer any are in relation to
us the greater sin it is to belie them and blemish their reputation. It
is spoken of as a crime of the highest nature to slander thy own
mother's son ([Psa 50:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#020).md), who is next
to thyself, much more to slander thy own wife, or thy own husband, that
is thyself: it is an ill bird indeed that defiles its own nest. 2.
Chastity is honour as well as virtue, and that which gives occasion for
the suspicion of it is as great a reproach and disgrace as any
whatsoever: in this matter therefore, above any thing, we should be
highly tender both of our own good name and that of others. 3. Parents
must look upon themselves as concerned to vindicate the reputation of
their children, for it is a branch of their own.

II\. If the woman that was married as a virgin was not found to be one
she was to be stoned to death at her father's door, [Deu
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#020.md), [Deu
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#021.md). If the uncleanness had been
committed before she was betrothed it would not have been punished as a
capital crime; but she must die for the abuse she put upon him whom she
married, being conscious to herself of being defiled, while she made him
believe her to be a chaste and modest woman. But some think that her
uncleanness was punished with death only in case it was committed after
she was betrothed, supposing there were few come to maturity but what
were betrothed, though not yet married. Now, 1. This gave a powerful
caution to young women to flee fornication, since, however concealed
before, so as not to mar their marriage, it would very likely be
discovered afterwards, to their perpetual infamy and utter ruin. 2. It
is intimated to parents that they must by all means possible preserve
their children's chastity, by giving them good advice and admonition,
setting them good examples, keeping them from bad company, praying for
them, and laying them under needful restraints, because, if the children
committed lewdness, the parents must have the grief and shame of the
execution at their own door. That phrase of folly wrought in Israel was
used concerning this very crime in the case of Dinah, [Gen
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#007.md). All sin is folly, uncleanness
especially; but, above all, uncleanness in Israel, by profession a holy
people.

III\. If any man, single or married, lay with a married woman, they were
both to be put to death, [Deu 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#022.md).
This law we had before, [Lev 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010.md).
For a married man to lie with a single woman was not a crime of so high
a nature, nor was it punished with death, because not introducing a
spurious brood into families under the character of legitimate children.

IV\. If a damsel were betrothed and not married, she was from under the
eye of her intended husband, and therefore she and her chastity were
taken under the special protection of the law. 1. If her chastity were
violated by her own consent, she was to be put to death, and her
adulterer with her, [Deu 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#023.md), [Deu
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#024.md). And it shall be presumed that
she consented if it were done in the city, or in any place where, had
she cried out, help might speedily have come in to prevent the injury
offered her. Qui tacet, consentire videtur - Silence implies consent.
Note, It may be presumed that those willingly yield to a temptation
(whatever they pretend) who will not use the means and helps they might
be furnished with to avoid and overcome it. Nay, her being found in the
city, a place of company and diversion, when she should have kept under
the protection of her father's house, was an evidence against her that
she had not that dread of the sin and the danger of it which became a
modest woman. Note, Those that needlessly expose themselves to
temptation justly suffer for the same, if, ere they are aware, they be
surprised and caught by it. Dinah lost her honour to gratify her
curiosity with a sight of the daughters of the land. By this law the
Virgin Mary was in danger of being made a public example, that is, of
being stoned to death, but that God, by an angel, cleared the matter to
Joseph. 2. If she were forced, and never consented, he that committed
the rape was to be put to death, but the damsel was to be acquitted,
[Deu 22:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#024.md). Now if it were done in
the field, out of the hearing of neighbours, it shall be presumed that
she cried out, but there was none to save her; and, besides, her going
into the field, a place of solitude, did not so much expose her. Now by
this law it is intimated to us, (1.) That we shall suffer only for the
wickedness we do, not for that which is done to us. That is no sin which
has not more or less of the will in it. (2.) That we must presume the
best concerning all persons, unless the contrary do appear; not only
charity, but equity teaches us to do so. Though none heard her cry, yet,
because none could hear it if she did, it shall be taken for granted
that she did. This rule we should go by in judging of persons and
actions: believe all things, and hope all things. (3.) That our chastity
should be as dear to us as our life when that is assaulted, it is not at
all improper to cry murder, murder, for, as when a man riseth against
his neighbour and slayeth him, even so is this matter. (4.) By way of
allusion to this, see what we are to do when Satan sets upon us with his
temptations: wherever we are, let us cry aloud to heaven for help
(Succurre, Domine, vim patior - Help me, O Lord, for I suffer violence),
and there we may be sure to be heard, and answered, as Paul was, My
grace is sufficient for thee.

V. If a damsel not betrothed were thus abused by violence, he that
abused her should be fined, the father should have the fine, and, if he
and the damsel did consent, he should be bound to marry her, and never
to divorce her, how much soever she was below him, and how unpleasing
soever she might afterwards be to him, as Tamar was to Amnon after he
had forced her, [Deu 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#028.md), [Deu
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#029.md). This was to deter men from such
vicious practices, which it is a shame that we are necessitated to read
and write of.

VI\. The law against a man's marrying his father's widow, or having any
undue familiarity with his father's wife, is here repeated ([Deu
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#030).md) from [Lev
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#008.md). And, probably, it is intended
(as bishop Patrick notes) for a short memorandum to them carefully to
observe all the laws there made against incestuous marriages, that being
specified which is the most detestable of all; it is that of which the
apostle says, It is not so much as named among the Gentiles, [Co1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001.md).
