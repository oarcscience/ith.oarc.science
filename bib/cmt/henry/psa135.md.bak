### [Psalms Chapter 135](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 135:0</span></span>

This is one of the Hallelujah-psalms; that is the title of it, and that
is the Amen of it, both its Alpha and its Omega. I. It begins with a
call to praise God, particularly a call to the "servants of the Lord" to
praise him, as in the foregoing psalm ([Psa
135:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001).md). II. It goes on to furnish us
with matter for praise. God is to be praised, 1. As the God of Jacob
([Psa 135:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004).md). 2. As the God of gods
([Psa 135:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#005).md). 3. As the God of the
whole world ([Psa 135:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#006.md), [Psa
135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007).md). 4. As a terrible God to the
enemies of Israel ([Psa 135:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#008).md). 5.
As a gracious God to Israel, both in what he had done for them and what
he would do ([Psa 135:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#012).md). 6. As
the only living God, all other gods being vanity and a lie ([Psa
135:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#015).md). III. It concludes with
another exhortation to all persons concerned to praise God ([Psa
135:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#019).md). In singing this psalm our
hearts must be filled, as well as our mouths, with the high praises of
God.

[Psalms 135:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 135:1</span></span>

Here is, 1. The duty we are called to - to praise the Lord, to praise
his name; praise him, and again praise him. We must not only thank him
for what he has done for us, but praise him for what he is in himself
and has done for others; take all occasions to speak well of God and to
give his truths and ways a good word. 2. The persons that are called
upon to do this - the servants of the Lord, the priests and Levites that
stand in his house, and all the devout and pious Israelites that stand
in the courts of his house to worship there, [Psa
135:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#002.md). Those that have most reason to
praise God who are admitted to the privileges of his house, and those
see most reason who there behold his beauty and taste his bounty; from
them it is expected, for to that end they enjoy their places. Who should
praise him if they do not? 3. The reasons why we should praise God. (1.)
Because he whom we are to praise is good, and goodness is that which
every body will speak well of. He is good to all, and we must give him
the praise of that. His goodness is his glory, and we must make mention
of it to his glory. (2.) Because the work is its own wages: Sing praises
to his name, for it is pleasant. It is best done with a cheerful spirit,
and we shall have the pleasure of having done our duty. It is a heaven
upon earth to be praising God; and the pleasure of that should quite put
our mouths out of taste for the pleasures of sin. (3.) Because of the
peculiar privileges of God's people ([Psa
135:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004).md): The Lord hath chosen Jacob to
himself, and therefore Jacob is bound to praise him; for therefore God
chose a people to himself that they might be unto him for a name and a
praise ([Jer 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#011).md), and therefore
Jacob has abundant matter for praise, being thus dignified and
distinguished. Israel is God's peculiar treasure above all people ([Exo
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005).md); they are his Segullah, a people
appropriated to him, and that he has a delight in, precious in his sight
and honourable. For this distinguishing surprising favour, if the seed
of Jacob do not praise him, they are the most unworthy ungrateful people
under the sun.

[Psalms 135:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 135:5</span></span>

The psalmist had suggested to us the goodness of God, as the proper
matter of our cheerful praises; here he suggests to us the greatness of
God as the proper matter of our awful praises; and on this he is most
copious, because this we are less forward to consider.

I. He asserts the doctrine of God's greatness ([Psa
135:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#005).md): The Lord is great, great
indeed, who knows no limits of time or place. He asserts it with
assurance, "I know that he is so; know it not only by observation of the
proofs of it, but by belief of the revelation of it. I know it; I am
sure of it; I know it by my own experience of the divine greatness
working on my soul." He asserts it with a holy defiance of all
pretenders, though they should join in confederacy against him. He is
not only above any god, but above all gods, infinitely above them,
between him and them there is no comparison.

II\. He proves him to be a great God by the greatness of his power, [Psa
135:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#006.md). 1. He has an absolute power,
and may do what he will: Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he, and
none could control him, or say unto him, What doest thou? He does what
he pleases, because he pleases, and gives not an account of any of his
matters. 2. He has an almighty power and can do what he will; if he will
work, none shall hinder. 3. This absolute almighty power is of universal
extent; he does what he will in heaven, in earth, in the seas, and in
all the deep places that are in the bottom of the sea or the bowels of
the earth. The gods of the heathen can do nothing; but our God can do
any thing and does do every thing.

III\. He gives instances of his great power,

1\. In the kingdom of nature, [Psa
135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007.md). All the powers of nature prove
the greatness of the God of nature, from whom they are derived and on
whom they depend. The chain of natural causes was not only framed by him
at first, but is still preserved by him. (1.) It is by his power that
exhalations are drawn up from the terraqueous globe. The heat of the sun
raises them, but it has that power from God, and therefore it is given
as an instance of the glory of God that nothing is hidden from the heat
of the sun, [Psa 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#006.md). He causes the
vapours to ascend (not only unhelped, but unseen, by us) from the earth,
from the ends of the earth, that is, from the seas, by which the earth
is surrounded. (2.) It is he who, out of those vapours so raised, forms
the rain, so that the earth is no loser by the vapours it sends up, for
they are returned with advantage in fruitful showers. (3.) Out of the
same vapours (such is his wonderful power) he makes lightnings or the
rain; by them he opens the bottles of heaven, and shakes the clouds,
that they may water the earth. Here are fire and water thoroughly
reconciled by divine omnipotence. They come together, and yet the water
does not quench the fire, nor the fire lick up the water, as fire from
heaven did when God pleased, [Kg1
18:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#038). (4..md) The same exhalations, to
serve another purpose, are converted into winds, which blow where they
list, from what point of the compass they will, and we are so far from
directing them that we cannot tell whence they come nor whither they go,
but God brings them out of his treasuries with as much exactness and
design as a prudent prince orders money to issue out of his exchequer.

2\. In the kingdoms of men; and here he mentions the great things God
had formerly done for his people Israel, which were proofs of God's
greatness as well as of his goodness, and confirmations of the truth of
the scriptures of the Old Testament, which began to be written by Moses,
the person employed in working those miracles. Observe God's sovereign
dominion and irresistible power, (1.) In bringing Israel out of Egypt,
humbling Pharaoh by many plagues, and so forcing him to let them go.
These plagues are called tokens and wonders, because they came not in
the common course of providence, but there was something miraculous in
each of them. They were sent upon Pharaoh and all his servants, his
subjects; but the Israelites, whom God claimed for his servants, his
son, his first-born, his free-born, were exempted from them, and no
plague came nigh their dwelling. The death of the first-born both of men
and cattle was the heaviest of all the plagues, and that which gained
the point. (2.) In destroying the kingdoms of Canaan before them, [Psa
135:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#010.md). Those that were in possession
of the land designed for Israel had all possible advantages for keeping
possession. The people were numerous, and warlike, and confederate
against Israel. They were great nations. Yet, if a great nation has a
meek and mean-spirited prince, it lies exposed; but these great nations
had mighty kings, and yet they were all smitten and slain - Sihon and
Og, and all the kingdoms of Canaan, [Psa
135:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#010.md), [Psa
135:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#011.md). No power of hell or earth can
prevent the accomplishment of the promise of God when the time, the set
time, for it has come. (3.) In settling them in the land of promise. He
that gives kingdoms to whomsoever he pleases gave Canaan to be a
heritage to Israel his people. It came to them by inheritance, for their
ancestors had the promise of it, though not the possession; and it
descended as an inheritance to their seed. This was done long before,
yet God is now praised for it; and with good reason, for the children
were now enjoying the benefit of it.

IV\. He triumphs in the perpetuity of God's glory and grace. 1. Of his
glory ([Psa 135:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#013).md): Thy name, O God!
endures for ever. God's manifestations of himself to his people have
everlasting fruits and consequences. What God doeth it shall be for
ever, [Ecc 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#014.md). His name endures for
ever in the constant and everlasting praises of his people; his memorial
endures, has endured hitherto, and shall still endure throughout all
generations of the church. This seems to refer to [Exo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#015.md), where, when God had called
himself the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, he adds, This is my name
for ever and this is my memorial unto all generations. God is, and will
be, always the same to his church, a gracious, faithful, wonder-working
God; and his church is, and will be, the same to him, a thankful
praising people; and thus his name endures for ever. 2. Of his grace. He
will be kind to his people. (1.) He will plead their cause against
others that contend with them. He will judge his people, that is, he
will judge for them, and will not suffer them to be run down. (2.) He
will not himself contend for ever with them, but will repent himself
concerning his servants, and not proceed in his controversy with them;
he will be entreated for them, or he will be comforted concerning them;
he will return in ways of mercy to them and will delight to do them
good. This verse is taken from the song of Moses, [Deu
32:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036.md).

[Psalms 135:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 135:15</span></span>

The design of these verses is,

I. To arm the people of God against idolatry and all false worship, by
showing what sort of gods they were that the heathen worshipped, as we
had it before, [Psa 115:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#004.md), etc. 1.
They were gods of their own making; being so, they could have no power
but what their makers gave them, and then what power could their makers
receive from them? The images were the work of men's hands, and the
deities that were supposed to inform them were as much the creatures of
men's fancy and imagination. 2. They had the shape of animals, but could
not perform the least act, no, not of the animal life. They could
neither see, nor hear, nor speak, nor so much as breathe; and therefore
to make them with eyes, and ears, and mouths, and nostrils, was such a
jest that one would wonder how reasonable creatures could suffer
themselves to be so imposed upon as to expect any good from such
mock-deities. 3. Their worshippers were therefore as stupid and
senseless as they were, both those that made them to be worshipped and
those that trusted in them when they were made, [Psa
135:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#018.md). The worshipping of such gods
as were the objects of sense, and senseless, made the worshippers
sensual and senseless. Let our worshipping a God that is a Spirit make
us spiritual and wise.

II\. To stir up the people of God to true devotion in the worship of the
true God, [Psa 135:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#019.md). The more
deplorable the condition of the Gentile nations that worship idols is
the more are we bound to thank God that we know better. Therefore, 1.
Let us set ourselves about the acts of devotion, and employ ourselves in
them: Bless the Lord, and again and again, bless the Lord. In the
parallel place ([Psa 115:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#009).md), by way
of inference from the impotency of idols, the duty thus pressed upon us
is to trust in the Lord; here to bless him; by putting our trust in God
we give glory to him, and those that depend upon God shall not want
matter of thanksgiving to him. All persons that knew God are here called
to praise him - the house of Israel (the nation in general), the house
of Aaron and the house of Levi (the Lord's ministers that attended in
his sanctuary), and all others that feared the Lord, though they were
not of the house of Israel. 2. Let God have the glory of all: Blessed be
the Lord. The tribute of praise arises out of Zion. All God's works do
praise him, but his saints bless him; and they need not go far to pay
their tribute, for he dwells in Jerusalem, in his church, which they are
members of, so that he is always nigh unto them to receive their homage.
The condescensions of his grace, in dwelling with men upon the earth,
call for our grateful and thankful returns, and our repeated
Hallelujahs.
