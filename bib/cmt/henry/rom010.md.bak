### [Romans Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#001.md)

[Romans](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rom 10:0</span></span>

The dissolving of the peculiar church-state of the Jews, and the
rejection of that polity by the repealing of their ceremonial law, the
vacating of all the institutions of it, the abolishing of their
priesthood, the burning of their temple, and the taking away of their
place and nation, and in their room the substituting and erecting of a
catholic church-state among the Gentile nations, though to us, now that
these things have long since been done and completed, they may seem no
great matter, yet to those who lived when they were doing, who knew how
high the Jews had stood in God's favour, and how deplorable the
condition of the Gentile world had been for many ages, it appeared very
great and marvellous, and a mystery hard to be understood. The apostle,
in this chapter, as in the foregoing and that which follows, is
explaining and proving it; but with several very useful digressions,
which a little interrupt the thread of his discourse. To two great
truths I would reduce this chapter: - I. That there is a great
difference between the righteousness of the law, which the unbelieving
Jews were wedded to, and the righteousness of faith offered in the
gospel ([Rom 10:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#001).md). II. That there
is no difference between Jews and Gentiles; but, in point of
justification and acceptance with God, the gospel sets them both upon
the same level ([Rom 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#012.md) to the
end).

[Romans 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 10:1</span></span>

The scope of the apostle in this part of the chapter is to show the vast
difference between the righteousness of the law and the righteousness of
faith, and the great pre-eminence of the righteousness of faith above
that of the law; that he might induce and persuade the Jews to believe
in Christ, aggravate the folly and sin of those that refused, and
justify God in the rejection of such refusers.

I. Paul here professes his good affection to the Jews, with the reason
of it ([Rom 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#001.md), [Rom
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#002).md), where he gives them a good
wish, and a good witness.

1\. A good wish ([Rom 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#001).md), a wish
that they might be saved - saved from the temporal ruin and destruction
that were coming upon them - saved from the wrath to come, eternal
wrath, which was hanging over their heads. It is implied in this wish
that they might be convinced and converted; he could not pray in faith
that they might be saved in their unbelief. Though Paul preached against
them, yet he prayed for them. Herein he was merciful, as God is, who is
not willing that any should perish ([Pe2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#009).md), desires not the death of
sinners. It is our duty truly and earnestly to desire the salvation of
our own. This, he says, was his heart's desire and prayer, which
intimates, (1.) The strength and sincerity of his desire. It was his
heart's desire; it was not a formal compliment, as good wishes are with
many from the teeth outward, but a real desire. This it was before it
was his prayer. The soul of prayer is the heart's desire. Cold desires
do but beg denials; we must even breathe out our souls in every prayer.
(2.) The offering up of this desire to God. It was not only his heart's
desire, but it was his prayer. There may be desires in the heart, and
yet no prayer, unless those desires be presented to God. Wishing and
woulding, if that be all, are not praying.

2\. A good witness, as a reason of his good wish ([Rom
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#002).md): I bear them record that they
have a zeal of God. The unbelieving Jews were the most bitter enemies
Paul had in the world, and yet Paul gives them as good a character as
the truth would bear. We should say the best we can even of our worst
enemies; this is blessing those that curse us. Charity teaches us to
have the best opinion of persons, and to put the best construction upon
words and actions, that they will bear. We should take notice of that
which is commendable even in bad people. They have a zeal of God. Their
opposition to the gospel is from a principle of respect to the law,
which they know to have come from God. There is such a thing as a blind
misguided zeal: such was that of the Jews, who, when they hated Christ's
people and ministers, and cast them out, said, Let the Lord be glorified
([Isa 66:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005).md); nay, they killed them,
and thought they did God good service, [Joh
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#002.md).

II\. He here shows the fatal mistake that the unbelieving Jews were
guilty of, which was their ruin. Their zeal was not according to
knowledge. It is true God gave them that law for which they were so
zealous; but they might have known that, by the appearance of the
promised Messiah, an end was put to it. He introduced a new religion and
way of worship, to which the former must give place. He proved himself
the Son of God, gave the most convincing evidence that could be of his
being the Messiah; and yet they did not know and would not own him, but
shut their eyes against the clear light, so that their zeal for the law
was blind. This he shows further, [Rom
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#003.md), where we may observe,

1\. The nature of their unbelief. They have not submitted themselves to
the righteousness of God, that is, they have not yielded to
gospel-terms, nor accepted the tender of justification by faith in
Christ, which is made in the gospel. Unbelief is a non-submission to the
righteousness of God, standing it out against the gospel proclamation of
indemnity. Have not submitted. In true faith, there is need of a great
deal of submission; therefore the first lesson Christ teaches is to deny
ourselves. It is a great piece of condescension for a proud heart to be
content to be beholden to free grace; we are loth to sue sub forma
pauperis - as paupers.

2\. The causes of their unbelief, and these are two: - (1.) Ignorance of
God's righteousness. They did not understand, and believe, and consider,
the strict justice of God, in hating and punishing sin, and demanding
satisfaction, did not consider what need we have of a righteousness
wherein to appear before him; if they had, they would never have stood
out against the gospel offer, nor expected justification by their own
works, as if they could satisfy God's justice. Or, being ignorant of
God's way of justification, which he has now appointed and revealed by
Jesus Christ. They did not know it, because they would not; they shut
their eyes against the discoveries of it, and love darkness rather. (2.)
A proud conceit of their own righteousness: Going about to establish
their own - a righteousness of their own devising, and of their own
working out, by the merit of their works, and by their observance of the
ceremonial law. They thought they needed not to be beholden to the merit
of Christ, and therefore depended upon their own performances as
sufficient to make up a righteousness wherein to appear before God. They
could not with Paul disclaim a dependence upon this ([Phi
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#009).md), Not having my own righteousness.
See an instance of this pride in the Pharisee, [Luk
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#010.md), [Luk
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#011.md). Compare [Rom
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#014.md).

III\. He here shows the folly of that mistake, and what an unreasonable
thing it was for them to be seeking justification by the works of the
law, now that Christ had come, and had brought in an everlasting
righteousness; considering,

1\. The subserviency of the law to the gospel ([Rom
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004).md): Christ is the end of the law
for righteousness. The design of the law was to lead people to Christ.
The moral law was but for the searching of the wound, the ceremonial law
for the shadowing forth of the remedy; but Christ is the end of both.
See [Co2 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007.md), and compare [Gal
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#023.md), [Gal
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024.md). The use of the law was to direct
people for righteousness to Christ. (1.) Christ is the end of the
ceremonial law; he is the period of it, because he is the perfection of
it. When the substance comes, the shadow is gone. The sacrifices, and
offerings, and purifications appointed under the Old Testament,
prefigured Christ, and pointed at him; and their inability to take away
sin discovered the necessity of a sacrifice that should, by being once
offered, take away sin. (2.) Christ is the end of the moral law in that
he did what the law could not do ([Rom
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003).md), and secured the great end of it.
The end of the law was to bring men to perfect obedience, and so to
obtain justification. This is now become impossible, by reason of the
power of sin and the corruption of nature; but Christ is the end of the
law. The law is not destroyed, nor the intention of the lawgiver
frustrated, but, full satisfaction being made by the death of Christ for
our breach of the law, the end is attained, and we are put in another
way of justification. Christ is thus the end of the law for
righteousness, that is, for justification; but it is only to every one
that believeth. Upon our believing, that is, our humble consent to the
terms of the gospel, we become interested in Christ's satisfaction, and
so are justified through the redemption that is in Jesus.

2\. The excellency of the gospel above the law. This he proves by
showing the different constitution of these two.

(1.) What is the righteousness which is of the law? This he shows, [Rom
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#005.md). The tenour of it is, Do, and
live. Though it directs us to a better and more effectual righteousness
in Christ, yet in itself, considered as a law abstracted from its
respect to Christ and the gospel (for so the unbelieving Jews embraced
and retained it), it owneth nothing as a righteousness sufficient to
justify a man but that of perfect obedience. For this he quotes that
scripture ([Lev 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005).md), You shall
therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, which if a man do, he shall
live in them. To this he refers likewise, [Gal
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#012.md), The man that doeth them, shall
live in them. Live, that is, be happy, not only in the land of Canaan,
but in heaven, of which Canaan was a type and figure. The doing supposed
must be perfect and sinless, without the least breach or violation. The
law which was given upon Mount Sinai, though it was not a pure covenant
of works (for who then could be saved under that dispensation?) yet,
that is might be the more effectual to drive people to Christ and to
make the covenant of grace welcome, it had a very great mixture of the
strictness and terror of the covenant of works. Now, was it not extreme
folly in the Jews to adhere so closely to this way of justification and
salvation, which was in itself so hard, and by the corruption of nature
now become impossible, when there was a new and a living way opened?

(2.) What is that righteousness which is of faith, [Rom
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#006.md), etc. This he describes in the
words of Moses, in Deuteronomy, in the second law (so Deuteronomy
signifies), where there was a much clearer revelation of Christ and the
gospel than there was in the first giving of the law: he quotes it from
[Deu 30:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#011.md), and shows,

\[1.\] That it is not at all hard or difficult. The way of justification
and salvation has in it no such depths or knots as may discourage us, no
insuperable difficulties attending it; but, as was foretold, it is a
high-way, [Isa 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#008.md). We are not put to
climb for it - it is not in heaven; we are not put to dive for it - it
is not in the deep. First, We need not go to heaven, to search the
records there, or to enquire into the secrets of the divine counsel. It
is true Christ is in heaven; but we may be justified and saved without
going thither, to fetch him thence, or sending a special messenger to
him. Secondly, We need not go to the deep, to fetch Christ out of the
grave, or from the state of the dead: Into the deep, to bring up Christ
from the dead. This plainly shows that Christ's descent into the deep,
or into hadēs, was no more than his going into the state of the dead, in
allusion to Jonah. It is true that Christ was in the grave, and it is as
true that he is now in heaven; but we need not perplex and puzzle
ourselves with fancied difficulties, nor must we create to ourselves
such gross and carnal ideas of these things as if the method of
salvation were impracticable, and the design of the revelation were only
to amuse us. No, salvation is not put at so vast a distance from us.

\[2.\] But it is very plain and easy: The word is nigh thee. When we
speak of looking upon Christ, and receiving Christ, and feeding upon
Christ, it is not Christ in heaven, nor Christ in the deep, that we
mean; but Christ in the promise, Christ exhibited to us, and offered, in
the word. Christ is nigh thee, for the word is nigh thee: nigh thee
indeed: it is in thy mouth, and in thy heart; there is no difficulty in
understanding, believing, and owning it. The work thou hast to do lies
within thee: the kingdom of God is within you, [Luk
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#021.md). Thence thou must fetch thy
evidences, not out of the records of heaven. It is, that is, it is
promised that it shall be, in thy mouth ([Isa
59:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#021).md), and in thy heart, [Jer
31:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033.md). All that which is done for us
is already done to our hands. Christ is come down from heaven; we need
not go to fetch him. He is come up from the deep; we need not perplex
ourselves how to bring him up. There is nothing now to be done, but a
work in us; this must be our care, to look to our heart and mouth. Those
that were under the law were to do all themselves, Do this, and live;
but the gospel discovers the greatest part of the work done already, and
what remains cut short in righteousness, salvation offered upon very
plain and easy terms, brought to our door, as it were, in the word which
is nigh us. It is in our mouth - we are reading it daily; it is in our
heart - we are, or should be, thinking of it daily. Even the word of
faith; the gospel and the promise of it, called the word of faith
because it is the object of faith about which it is conversant, the word
which we believe; - because it is the precept of faith, commanding it,
and making it the great condition of justification; - and because it is
the ordinary means by which faith is wrought and conveyed. Now what is
this word of faith? We have the tenour of it, [Rom
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#009.md), [Rom
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#010.md), the sum of the gospel, which is
plain and easy enough. Observe,

First, What is promised to us: Thou shalt be saved. It is salvation that
the gospel exhibits and tenders - saved from guilt and wrath, with the
salvation of the soul, an eternal salvation, which Christ is the author
of, a Saviour to the uttermost.

Secondly, Upon what terms.

a\. Two things are required as conditions of salvation: - (a.)
Confessing the Lord Jesus - openly professing relation to him and
dependence on him, as our prince and Saviour, owning Christianity in the
face of all the allurements and affrightments of this world, standing by
him in all weathers. Our Lord Jesus lays a great stress upon this
confessing of him before men; see [Mat
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#032.md), [Mat
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#033.md). It is the product of many
graces, evinces a great deal of self-denial, love to Christ, contempt of
the world, a mighty courage and resolution. It was a very great thing,
especially, when the profession of Christ or Christianity hazarded
estate, honour, preferment, liberty, life, and all that is dear in this
world, which was the case in the primitive times. (b.) Believing in the
heart that God raised him from the dead. The profession of faith with
the mouth, if there be not the power of it in the heart, is but a
mockery; the root of it must be laid in an unfeigned assent to the
revelation of the gospel concerning Christ, especially concerning his
resurrection, which is the fundamental article of the Christian faith,
for thereby he was declared to be the Son of God with power, and full
evidence was given that God accepted his satisfaction.

b\. This is further illustrated ([Rom
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#010).md), and the order inverted,
because there must first be faith in the heart before there can be an
acceptable confession with the mouth. (a.) Concerning faith: It is with
the heart that man believeth, which implies more than an assent of the
understanding, and takes in the consent of the will, an inward, hearty,
sincere, and strong consent. It is not believing (not to be reckoned so)
if it be not with the heart. This is unto righteousness. There is the
righteousness of justification and the righteousness of sanctification.
Faith is to both; it is the condition of our justification ([Rom
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001).md), and it is the root and spring of
our sanctification; in it it is begun; by it it is carried on, [Act
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#009). (b..md) Concerning profession: It
is with the mouth that confession is made - confession to God in prayer
and praise ([Rom 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#006).md), confession to
men by owning the ways of God before others, especially when we are
called to it in a day of persecution. It is fit that God should be
honoured with the mouth, for he made man's mouth ([Exo
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#011).md), and at such a time has promised
to give his faithful people a mouth and wisdom, [Luk
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#015.md). It is part of the honour of
Christ that every tongue shall confess, [Phi
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#011.md). And this is said to be unto
salvation, because it is the performance of the condition of that
promise, [Mat 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#032.md). Justification by
faith lays the foundation of our title to salvation; but by confession
we build upon that foundation, and come at last to the full possession
of that to which we were entitled. So that we have here a brief summary
of the terms of salvation, and they are very reasonable; in short this,
that we must devote, dedicate, and give up, to God, our souls and our
bodies - our souls in believing with the heart, and our bodies in
confessing with the mouth. This do, and thou shalt live. For this ([Rom
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#011).md) he quotes [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md), Whosoever believeth on him
shall not be ashamed; ou kataischunthēsetai. That is, \[a.\] He will not
be ashamed to own that Christ in whom he trusts; he that believes in the
heart will not be ashamed to confess with the mouth. It is sinful shame
that makes people deny Christ, [Mar
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#038.md). He that believeth will not make
haste (so the prophet has it) - will not make haste to run away from the
sufferings he meets with in the way of his duty, will not be ashamed of
a despised religion. \[b.\] He shall not be ashamed of his hope in
Christ; he shall not be disappointed of his end. It is our duty that we
must not, it is our privilege that we shall not, be ashamed of our faith
in Christ. He shall never have cause to repent his confidence in
reposing such a trust in the Lord Jesus.

[Romans 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 10:12</span></span>

The first words express the design of the apostle through these verses,
that there is no difference between Jews and Gentiles, but they stand
upon the same level in point of acceptance with God. In Jesus Christ
there is neither Greek nor Jews, [Col
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#011.md). God doth not save any nor reject
any because they are Jews, nor because they are Greeks, but doth equally
accept both upon gospel terms: There is no difference. For the proof of
this he urges two arguments: -

I. That God is the same to all: The same Lord over all is rich unto all.
There is not one God to the Jews who is more kind, and another to the
Gentiles who is less kind; but he is the same to all, a common father to
all mankind. When he proclaimed his name, The Lord, the Lord god,
gracious and merciful, he thereby signified not only what he was to the
Jews, but what he is and will be to all his creatures that seek unto
him: not only good, but rich, plenteous in goodness: he hath wherewith
to supply them all, and he is free and ready to give out to them; he is
both able and willing: not only rich, but rich unto us, liberal and
bountiful in dispensing his favours to all that call upon him. Something
must be done by us, that we may reap of this bounty; and it is as little
as can be, we must call upon him. He will for this be enquired of ([Eze
36:37](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#037).md), and surely that which is not
worth the asking is not worth the having. We have nothing to do but to
draw out by prayer, as there is occasion.

II\. That the promise is the same to all ([Rom
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#013).md): Whoever shall call - one as
well as another, without exception. This extent, this undifferencing
extent, of the promise both to Jews and Gentiles he thinks should not be
surprising, for it was foretold by the prophet, [Joe
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#032.md). Calling upon the name of the
Lord is here put for all practical religion. What is the life of a
Christian but a life of prayer? It implies a sense of our dependence on
him, an entire dedication of ourselves to him, and a believing
expectation of our all from him. He that thus calls upon him shall be
saved. It is but ask and have; what would we have more? for the further
illustration of this he observes,

1\. How necessary it was that the gospel should be preached to the
Gentiles, [Rom 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#014.md), [Rom
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#015.md). This was what the Jews were so
angry with Paul for, that he was the apostle of the Gentiles, and
preached the gospel to them. Now he shows how needful it was to bring
them within the reach of the forementioned promise, an interest in which
they should not envy to any of their fellow-creatures. (1.) They cannot
call on him in whom they have not believed. Except they believe that he
is God, they will not call upon him by prayer; to what purpose should
they? The grace of faith is absolutely necessary to the duty of prayer;
we cannot pray aright, nor pray to acceptation, without it. He that
comes to God by prayer must believe, [Heb
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006.md). Till they believed the true God,
they were calling upon idols, O Baal, hear us. (2.) They cannot believe
in him of whom they have not heard. some way or other the divine
revelation must be made known to us, before we can receive it and assent
to it; it is not born with us. In hearing is included reading, which is
tantamount, and by which many are brought to believe ([Joh
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#031).md): These things are written that
you may believe. But hearing only is mentioned, as the more ordinary and
natural way of receiving information. (3.) They cannot hear without a
preacher; how should they? Somebody must tell them what they are to
believe. Preachers and hearers are correlates; it is a blessed thing
when they mutually rejoice in each other - the hearers in the skill and
faithfulness of the preacher, and the preacher in the willingness and
obedience of the hearers. (4.) They cannot preach except they be sent,
except they be both commissioned and in some measure qualified for their
preaching work. How shall a man act as an ambassador, unless he have
both his credentials and his instructions from the prince that sends
him? This proves that to the regular ministry there must be a regular
mission and ordination. It is God's prerogative to send ministers; he is
the Lord of the harvest, and therefore to him we must pray that he would
send forth labourers, [Mat 9:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#038.md). He
only can qualify men for, and incline them to, the work of the ministry.
But the competency of that qualification, and the sincerity of that
inclination, must not be left to the judgment of every man for himself:
the nature of the thing will by no means admit this; but, for the
preservation of due order in the church, this must needs be referred and
submitted to the judgment of a competent number of those who are
themselves in that office and of approved wisdom and experience in it,
who, as in all other callings, are presumed the most able judges, and
who are empowered to set apart such as they find so qualified and
inclined to this work of the ministry, that by this preservation of the
succession the name of Christ may endure for ever and his throne as the
days of heaven. And those that are thus set apart, not only may, but
must preach, as those that are sent.

2\. How welcome the gospel ought to be to those to whom it was preached,
because it showed the way to salvation, [Rom
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#015.md). For this he quotes [Isa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007.md). The like passage we have, [Nah
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015.md), which, if it point at the glad
tidings of the deliverance of Israel out of Babylon in the type, yet
looks further to the gospel, the good news of our salvation by Jesus
Christ. Observe, (1.) What the gospel is: It is the gospel of peace; it
is the word of reconciliation between God and man. On earth peace, [Luk
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014.md). Or, peace is put in general for
all good; so it is explained here; it is glad tidings of good things.
The things of the gospel are good things indeed, the best things;
tidings concerning them are the most joyful tidings, the best news that
ever came from heaven to earth. (2.) What the work of ministers is: To
preach this gospel, to bring these glad tidings; to evangelize peace (so
the original is), to evangelize good things. Every good preacher is in
this sense an evangelist: he is not only a messenger to carry the news,
but an ambassador to treat; and the first gospel preachers were angels,
[Luk 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#013), etc. (3..md) How acceptable
they should therefore be to the children of men for their work's sake:
How beautiful are the feet, that is, how welcome are they! Mary
Magdalene expressed her love to Christ by kissing his feet, and
afterwards by holding him by the feet, [Mat
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#009.md). And, when Christ was sending
forth his disciples, he washed their feet. Those that preach the gospel
of peace should see to it that their feet (their life and conversation)
be beautiful: the holiness of ministers' lives is the beauty of their
feet. How beautiful! namely, in the eyes of those that hear them. Those
that welcome the message cannot but love the messengers. See [Th1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012.md), [Th1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#013.md).

3\. He answers an objection against all this, which might be taken from
the little success which the gospel had in many places ([Rom
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#016).md): But they have not all obeyed
the gospel. All the Jews have not, all the Gentiles have not; far the
greater part of both remain in unbelief and disobedience. Observe, The
gospel is given us not only to be known and believed, but to be obeyed.
It is not a system of notions, but a rule of practice. This little
success of the word was likewise foretold by the prophet ([Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001).md): Who hath believed our report?
Very few have, few to what one would think should have believed it,
considering how faithful a report it is and how well worthy of all
acceptation, - very few to the many that persist in unbelief. It is no
strange thing, but it is a very sad and uncomfortable thing, for the
ministers of Christ to bring the report of the gospel, and not to be
believed in it. Under such a melancholy consideration it is good for us
to go to God and make our complaint to him. Lord, who hath believed,
etc. In answer to this,

(1.) He shows that the word preached is the ordinary means of working
faith ([Rom 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017).md): So then, ara -
however; though many that hear do not believe, yet those that believe
have first heard. Faith cometh by hearing. It is the summary of what he
had said before, [Rom 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#014.md). The
beginning, progress, and strength of faith, are by hearing. The word of
God is therefore called the word of faith: it begets and nourishes
faith. God gives faith, but it is by the word as the instrument. Hearing
(that hearing which works faith) is by the word of God. It is not
hearing the enticing words of man's wisdom, but hearing the word of God,
that will befriend faith, and hearing it as the word of God. See [Th1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013.md).

(2.) That those who would not believe the report of the gospel, yet,
having heard it, were thereby left inexcusable, and may thank themselves
for their own ruin, [Rom 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#018.md), to the
end.

\[1.\] The Gentiles have heard it ([Rom
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#018).md): Have they not heard? Yes, more
or less, they have either heard the gospel, or at least heard of it.
Their sound went into all the earth; not only a confused sound, but
their words (more distinct and intelligible notices of these things) are
gone unto the ends of the world. The commission which the apostles
received runs thus: Go you into all the world - preach to every creature
- disciple all nations; and they did with indefatigable industry and
wonderful success pursue that commission. See the extent of Paul's
province, [Rom 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#019.md). To this remote
island of Britain, one of the utmost corners of the world, not only the
sound, but the words, of the gospel came within a few years after
Christ's ascension. It was in order to this that the gift of tongues was
at the very first poured so plentifully upon the apostles, Acts 2. In
the expression here he plainly alludes to [Psa
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#004.md), which speaks of the notices
which the visible works of God in the creation give to all the world of
the power and Godhead of the Creator. As under the Old Testament God
provided for the publishing of the work of creation by the sun, moon,
and stars, so now for the publishing of the work of redemption to all
the world by the preaching of gospel ministers, who are therefore called
stars.

\[2.\] The Jews have heard it too, [Rom
10:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#019.md). For this he appeals to two
passages of the Old Testament, to show how inexcusable they are too. Did
not Israel know that the Gentiles were to be called in? They might have
known it from Moses and Isaiah.

First, One is taken from [Deu 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021.md), I
will provoke you to jealousy. The Jews not only had the offer, but saw
the Gentiles accepting it and benefitted by that acceptance, witness
their vexation at the event. They had the refusal: To you first, [Act
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#026.md). In all places where the apostles
came still the Jews had the first offer, and the Gentiles had but their
leavings. If one would not, another would. Now this provoked them to
jealousy. They, as the elder brother in the parable (Lu. 15) envied the
reception and entertainment of the prodigal Gentiles upon their
repentance. The Gentiles are here called no people, and a foolish
nation, that is, not the professing people of God. How much soever there
be of the wit and wisdom of the world, those that are not the people of
God are, and in the end will be found to be, a foolish people. Such was
the state of the Gentile world, who yet were made the people of God, and
Christ to them the wisdom of God. What a provocation it was to the Jews
to see the Gentiles taken into favour we may see, [Act
13:45](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#045.md); [Act
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005.md), [Act
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#013.md), and especially [Act
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#022.md). It was an instance of the great
wickedness of the Jews that they were thus enraged; and this in
Deuteronomy is the matter of a threatening. God often makes people's sin
their punishment. A man needs no greater plague than to be left to the
impetuous rage of his own lusts.

Secondly, Another is taken from [Isa
65:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001.md), [Isa
65:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#002.md), which is very full, and in it
Esaias is very bold - bold indeed, to speak so plainly of the rejection
of his own countrymen. Those that will be found faithful have need to be
very bold. Those that are resolved to please God must not be afraid to
displease any man. Now Esaias speaks boldly and plainly,

a\. Of the preventing grace and favour of God in the reception and
entertainment of the Gentiles ([Rom
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#020).md): I was found of those that
sought me not. The prescribed method is, Seek and find; this is a rule
for us, not a rule for God, who is often found of those that do not
seek. His grace is his own, distinguishing grace his own, and he
dispenses it in a way of sovereignty, gives of withholds it at pleasure
- anticipates us with the blessings, the riches choicest blessings, of
his goodness. Thus he manifested himself to the Gentiles, by sending the
light of the gospel among them, when they were so far from seeking him
and asking after him that they were following after lying vanities, and
serving dumb idols. Was not this our own particular case? Did not God
begin in love, and manifest himself to us when we did not ask after him?
And was not that a time of love indeed, to be often remembered with a
great deal of thankfulness?

b\. Of the obstinacy and perverseness of Israel, notwithstanding the
fair offers and affectionate invitations they had, [Rom
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#021.md). Observe,

(a.) God's great goodness to them: All day long I have stretched forth
my hands. \[a.\] His offers: I have stretched forth my hands, offering
them life and salvation with the greatest sincerity and seriousness that
can be, with all possible expressions of earnestness and importunity,
showing them the happiness tendered, setting it before them with the
greatest evidence, reasoning the case with them. Stretching forth the
hands is the gesture of those that require audience ([Act
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#001).md), or desire acceptance, [Pro
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#024.md). Christ was crucified with his
hands stretched out. Stretched forth my hands as offering reconciliation
- come let us shake hands and be friends; and our duty is to give the
hand to him, [Ch2 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#008.md). \[b.\] His
patience in making these offers: All day long. The patience of God
towards provoking sinners is admirable. He waits to be gracious. The
time of God's patience is here called a day, lightsome as a day and fit
for work and business, but limited as a day, and a night at the end of
it. he bears long, but he will not bear always.

(b.) Their great badness to him. They were a disobedient gainsaying
people. One word in the Hebrew, in Isaiah, is here well explained by
two; not only disobedient to the call, not yielding to it, but
gainsaying, and quarrelling with it, which is much worse. Many that will
not accept of a good proposal will yet acknowledge that they have
nothing to say against it: but the Jews who believed not rested not
there, but contradicted and blasphemed. God's patience with them was a
very great aggravation of their disobedience, and rendered it the more
exceedingly sinful; as their disobedience advanced the honour of God's
patience and rendered it the more exceedingly gracious. It is a wonder
of mercy in God that his goodness is not overcome by man's badness; and
it is a wonder of wickedness in man that his badness is not overcome by
God's goodness.
