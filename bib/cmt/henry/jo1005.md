### [1 John Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001.md)

[1 John](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jo1 5:0</span></span>

In this chapter the apostle asserts, I. The dignity of believers ([Jo1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001).md). II. Their obligation to love,
and the trial of it ([Jo1 5:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001).md). III.
Their victory ([Jo1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004.md), [Jo1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#005).md). IV. The credibility and
confirmation of their faith ([Jo1
5:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006).md). V. The advantage of their
faith in eternal life ([Jo1 5:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#011).md).
VI. The audience of their prayers, unless for those who have sinned unto
death ([Jo1 5:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014).md). VII. The
preservation from sin and Satan ([Jo1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018).md). VIII. Their happy distinction
from the world ([Jo1 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019).md). IX. Their
true knowledge of God ([Jo1 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020).md),
upon which they must depart from idols ([Jo1
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#021).md).

[1 John 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo1 5:1</span></span>

I. The apostle having, in the conclusion of the last chapter, as was
there observed, urged Christian love upon those two accounts, as
suitable to Christian profession and as suitable to the divine command,
here adds a third: Such love is suitable, and indeed demanded, by their
eminent relation; our Christian brethren or fellow-believers are nearly
related to God; they are his children: Whosoever believeth that Jesus is
the Christ is born of God, [Jo1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001.md).
Here the Christian brother is, 1. Described by his faith; he that
believeth that Jesus is the Christ - that he is Messiah the prince, that
he is the Son of God by nature and office, that he is the chief of all
the anointed world, chief of all the priests, prophets, or kings, who
were ever anointed by God or for him, that he is perfectly prepared and
furnished for the whole work of the eternal salvation - accordingly
yields himself up to his care and direction; and then he is, 2.
Dignified by his descent: He is born of God, [Jo1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001.md). This principle of faith, and the
new nature that attends it or from which it springs, are ingenerated by
the Spirit of God; and so sonship and adoption are not now appropriated
to the seed of Abraham according to the flesh, not to the ancient Israel
of God; all believers, though by nature sinners of the Gentiles, are
spiritually descended from God, and accordingly are to be beloved; as it
is added: Every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is
begotten of him, [Jo1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001.md). It seems
but natural that he who loves the Father should love the children also,
and that in some proportion to their resemblance to their Father and to
the Father's love to them; and so we must first and principally love the
Son of the Father, as he is most emphatically styled, [Jo2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#003), the only (necessarily.md) begotten,
and the Son of his love, and then those that are voluntarily begotten,
and renewed by the Spirit of grace.

II\. The apostle shows, 1. How we may discern the truth, or the true
evangelical nature of our love to the regenerate. The ground of it must
be our love to God, whose they are: By this we know that we love the
children of God, when we love God, [Jo1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#002.md). Our love to them appears to be
sound and genuine when we love them not merely upon any secular account,
as because they are rich, or learned, or kind to us, or of our
denomination among religious parties; but because they are God's
children, his regenerating grace appears in them, his image and
superscription are upon them, and so in them God himself is loved. Thus
we see what that love to the brethren is that is so pressed in this
epistle; it is love to them as the children of God and the adopted
brethren of the Lord Jesus. 2. How we may learn the truth of our love to
God - it appears in our holy obedience: When we love God, and keep his
commandments, [Jo1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#002.md). Then we truly,
and in gospel account, love God, when we keep his commandments: For this
is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and the keeping of
his commandments requires a spirit inclined thereto and delighting
herein; and so his commandments are not grievous, [Jo1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#003.md). Or, This is the love of God,
that, as thereby we are determined to obedience, and to keep the
commandments of God, so his commandments are thereby made easy and
pleasant to us. The lover of God says, "O how I love thy law! I will run
the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart ([Psa
119:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#032).md), when thou shalt enlarge it
either with love or with thy Spirit, the spring of love." 3. What is and
ought to be the result and effect of regeneration - an intellectual
spiritual conquest of this world: For whatsoever is born of God, or, as
in some copies, whosoever is born of God, overcometh the world, [Jo1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004.md). He that is born of God is born
for God, and consequently for another world. He has a temper and
disposition that tend to a higher and better world; and he is furnished
with such arms, or such a weapon, whereby he can repel and conquer this;
as it is added, And this is the victory that overcometh the world, even
our faith, [Jo1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004.md). Faith is the
cause of victory, the means, the instrument, the spiritual armour and
artillery by which we overcome; for, (1.) In and by faith we cleave to
Christ, in contempt of, and opposition to, the world. (2.) Faith works
in and by love to God and Christ, and so withdraws us from the love of
the world. (3.) Faith sanctifies the heart, and purifies it from those
sensual lusts by which the world obtains such sway and dominion over
souls. (4.) It receives and derives strength from the object of it, the
Son of God, for conquering the frowns and flatteries of the world. (5.)
It obtains by gospel promise a right to the indwelling Spirit of grace,
that is greater than he who dwells in the world. (6.) It sees an
invisible world at hand, with which this world is not worthy to be
compared, and into which it tells the soul in which it resides it must
be continually prepared to enter; and thereupon,

III\. The apostle concludes that it is the real Christian that is the
true conqueror of the world: Who is he then that overcometh the world,
but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? [Jo1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#005.md). It is the world that lies in our
way to heaven, and is the great impediment to our entrance there. But he
who believes that Jesus is the Son of God believes therein that Jesus
Came from God to be the Saviour of the world, and powerfully to conduct
us from the world to heaven, and to God, who is fully to be enjoyed
there. And he who so believes must needs by this faith overcome the
world. For, 1. He must be well satisfied that this world is a vehement
enemy to his soul, to his holiness, his salvation, and his blessedness.
For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the
eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world,
[Jo1 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#016.md). 2. He sees it must be a
great part of the Saviour's work, and of his own salvation, to be
redeemed and rescued from this malignant world. Who gave himself for our
sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, [Gal
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#004.md). 3. He sees in and by the life and
conduct of the Lord Jesus on earth that this world is to be renounced
and overcome. 4. He perceives that the Lord Jesus conquered the world,
not for himself only, but for his followers; and they must study to be
partakers of his victory. Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.
5. He is taught and influenced by the Lord Jesus's death to be mortified
and crucified to the world. God forbid that I should glory, save in the
cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me,
and I unto the world, [Gal 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#014.md). 6. He
is begotten by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to the
lively hope of a blessed world above, [Pe1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003.md). 7. He knows that the Saviour has
gone to heaven, and is there preparing a place for his serious
believers, [Joh 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#002.md). 8. He knows that
his Saviour will come again thence, and will put an end to this world,
and judge the inhabitants of it, and receive his believers to his
presence and glory, [Joh 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#003.md). 9. He
is possessed with a spirit and disposition that cannot be satisfied with
this world, that look beyond it, and are still tending, striving, and
pressing, towards the world in heaven. In this we groan, earnestly
desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven, [Co2
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#002.md). So that it is the Christian
religion that affords its proselytes a universal empire. It is the
Christian revelation that is the great means of conquering the world,
and gaining another that is most pure and peaceful, blessed and eternal.
It is there, in that revelation, that we see what are the occasion and
ground of the quarrel and contest between the holy God and this
rebellious world. It is there that we meet with sacred doctrine (both
speculative and practical), quite contrary to the tenour, temper, and
tendency of this world. It is by that doctrine that a spirit is
communicated and diffused which is superior and adverse to the spirit of
the world. It is there we see that the Saviour himself was not of this
world that his kingdom was not and is not so, that it must be separated
from the world and gathered out of it for heaven and for God. There we
see that the Saviour designs not this world for the inheritance and
portion of his saved company. As he has gone to heaven himself, so he
assures them he goes to prepare for their residence there, as designing
they should always dwell with him, and allowing them to believe that if
in this life, and this world only, they had hope in him, they should at
last be but miserable. It is there that the eternal blessed world is
most clearly revealed and proposed to our affection and pursuit. It is
there that we are furnished with the best arms and artillery against the
assaults and attempts of the world. It is there that we are taught how
the world may be out-shot in its own bow, or its artillery turned
against itself; and its oppositions, encounters, and persecutions, be
made serviceable to our conquest of the world, and to our motion and
ascent to the higher heavenly world: and there we are encouraged by a
whole army and cloud of holy soldiers, who have in their several ages,
posts, and stations, overcome the world, and won the crown. It is the
real Christian that is the proper hero, who vanquishes the world and
rejoices in a universal victory. Nor does he (for he is far superior to
the Grecian monarch) mourn that there is not another world to be
subdued, but lays hold on the eternal world of life, and in a sacred
sense takes the kingdom of heaven by violence too. Who in all the world
but the believer on Jesus Christ can thus overcome the world?

[1 John 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo1 5:6</span></span>

The faith of the Christian believer (or the believer in Christ) being
thus mighty and victorious, it had need to be well founded, to be
furnished with unquestionable celestial evidence concerning the divine
mission, authority, and office of the Lord Jesus; and it is so; he
brings his credentials along with him, and he brings them in a way by
which he came and in the witness that attends him.

I. In the way and manner by which he came; not barely by which he came
into the world, but by and with which he came, and appeared, and acted,
as a Saviour in the world: This is he that came by water and blood. He
came to save us from our sins, to give us eternal life, and bring us to
God; and, that he might the more assuredly do this, he came by, or with,
water and blood. Even Jesus Christ; Jesus Christ, I say, did so; and
none but he. And I say it again, not by or with water only, but by and
with water and blood, [Jo1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006.md). Jesus
Christ came with water and blood, as the notes and signatures of the
true effectual Saviour of the world; and he came by water and blood as
the means by which he would heal and save us. That he must and did thus
come in his saving office may appear by our remembering these things: -

1\. We are inwardly and outwardly defiled. (1.) Inwardly, by the power
and pollution off sin and in our nature. For our cleansing from this we
need spiritual water; such as can reach the soul and the powers of it.
Accordingly, there is in and by Christ Jesus the washing of regeneration
and the renewing of the Holy Ghost. And this was intimated to the
apostles by our Lord, when he washed their feet, and said to Peter, who
refused to be washed, Except I wash thee, thou hast no part in me. (2.)
We are defiled outwardly, by the guilt and condemning power of sin upon
our persons. By this we are separated from God, and banished from his
favourable, gracious, beatific presence for ever. From this we must be
purged by atoning blood. It is the law or determination in the court of
heaven that without shedding of blood there shall be no remission, [Heb
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#022.md). The Saviour from sin therefore
must come with blood.

2\. Both these ways of cleansing were represented in the old ceremonial
institutions of God. Persons and things must be purified by water and
blood. There were divers washings and carnal ordinances imposed till the
time of reformation, [Heb 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010.md). The
ashes of a heifer, mixed with water, sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth
to the purifying of the flesh, [Heb
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#013.md); [Num
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#009.md). And likewise almost all things
are, by the law, purged with blood, [Heb
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#022.md). As those show us our double
defilement, so they indicate the Saviour's two-fold purgation.

3\. At and upon the death of Jesus Christ, his side being pierced with a
soldier's spear, out of the wound there immediately issued water and
blood. This the beloved apostle saw, and he seems to have been affected
with the sight; he alone records it, and seems to reckon himself obliged
to record it, and seems to reckon himself obliged to record it, as
containing something mysterious in it: And he that saw it bore record,
and his record is true. And he knoweth, being an eye-witness, that he
saith true, that you might believe, and that you might believe this
particularly, that out of his pierced side forthwith there came water
and blood, [Joh 19:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#034.md), [Joh
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#035.md). Now this water and blood are
comprehensive of all that is necessary and effectual to our salvation.
By the water our souls are washed and purified for heaven and the region
of saints in light. By the blood God is glorified, his law is honoured,
and his vindictive excellences are illustrated and displayed. Whom God
hath set forth, or purposed, or proposed, a propitiation through faith
in his blood, or a propitiation in or by his blood through faith, to
declare his righteousness, that he may be just, and the justifier of him
that believeth in Jesus, [Rom 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md),
[Rom 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026.md). By the blood we are
justified, reconciled, and presented righteous to God. By the blood, the
curse of the law being satisfied, and purifying Spirit is obtained for
the internal ablution of our natures. Christ hath redeemed us from the
curse of the law, that the blessing of Abraham might come on the
Gentiles, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit, the promised
Spirit, through faith, [Gal 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013.md), etc.
The water, as well as the blood, issued out of the side of the
sacrificed Redeemer. The water and the blood then comprehend all things
that can be requisite to our salvation. They will consecrate and
sanctify to that purpose all that God shall appoint or make use of in
order to that great end. He loved the church, and gave himself for it,
that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the
word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, [Eph
5:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025.md). He who comes by water and
blood is an accurate perfect Saviour. And this is he who comes by water
and blood, even Jesus Christ! Thus we see in what way and manner, or, if
you please, with what utensils, he comes. But we see his credentials
also,

II\. In the witness that attends him, and that is, the divine Spirit,
that Spirit to whom the perfecting of the works of God is usually
attributed: And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, [Jo1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006.md). It was meet that the commissioned
Saviour of the world should have a constant agent to support his work,
and testify of him to the world. It was meet that a divine power should
attend him, his gospel, and servants; and notify to the world upon what
errand and office they came, and by what authority they were sent: this
was done in and by the Spirit of God, according to the Saviour's own
prediction, "He shall glorify me, even when I shall be rejected and
crucified by men, for he shall receive or take of mine. He shall not
receive my immediate office; he shall not die and rise again for you;
but he shall receive of mine, shall proceed on the foundation I have
laid, shall take up my institution, and truth, and cause, and shall
further show it unto you, and by you to the world," [Joh
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#014.md). And then the apostle adds the
commendation or the acceptableness of this witness: Because the Spirit
is truth, [Jo1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006.md). He is the Spirit
of God, and cannot lie. There is a copy that would afford us a very
suitable reading thus: because, or that, Christ is the truth. And so it
indicates the matter of the Spirit's testimony, the thing which he
attests, and that is, the truth of Christ: And it is the Spirit that
beareth witness that Christ is the truth; and consequently that
Christianity, or the Christian religion, is the truth of the day, the
truth of God. But it is meet that one or two copies should alter the
text; and our present reading is very agreeable, and so we retain it.
The Spirit is truth. He is indeed the Spirit of truth, [Joh
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#017.md). And that the Spirit is truth,
and a witness worthy of all acceptation, appears in that he is a
heavenly witness, or one of the witnesses that in and from heaven bore
testimony concerning the truth and authority of Christ. Because (or for)
there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and
the Holy Ghost, and these three are one. And so [Jo1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#007.md) most appositely occurs, as a proof
of the authenticity of the Spirit's testimony; he must needs be true, or
even truth itself, if he be not only a witness in heaven, but even one
(not in testimony only, for so an angel may be, but in being and
essence) with the Father and the Word. But here,

1\. We are stopped in our course by the contest there is about the
genuineness of [Jo1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#007.md). It is alleged
that many old Greek manuscripts have it not. We shall not here enter
into the controversy. It should seem that the critics are not agreed
what manuscripts have it and what not; nor do they sufficiently inform
us of the integrity and value of the manuscripts they peruse. Some may
be so faulty, as I have an old printed Greek Testament so full of
errata, that one would think no critic would establish a various lection
thereupon. But let the judicious collators of copies manage that
business. There are some rational surmises that seem to support the
present text and reading. As,

(1.) If we admit [Jo1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#008.md), in the room
of [Jo1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#007.md), it looks too like a
tautology and repetition of what was included in [Jo1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006.md), This is he that came by water and
blood, not by water only, but by water and blood; and it is the Spirit
that beareth witness. For there are three that bear witness, the Spirit,
the water, and the blood. This does not assign near so noble an
introduction of these three witnesses as our present reading does.

(2.) It is observed that many copies read that distinctive clause, upon
the earth: There are three that bear record upon the earth. Now this
bears a visible opposition to some witness or witnesses elsewhere, and
therefore we are told, by the adversaries of the text, that this clause
must be supposed to be omitted in most books that want [Jo1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#007.md). But it should for the same reason
be so in all. Take we [Jo1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006.md), This
is he that came by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth
witness, because the Spirit is truth. It would not now naturally and
properly be added, For there are three that bear record on earth, unless
we should suppose that the apostle would tell us that all the witnesses
are such as are on earth, when yet he would assure us that one is
infallibly true, or even truth itself.

(3.) It is observed that there is a variety of reading even in the Greek
text, as in [Jo1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#007.md). Some copies read
hen eisi - are one; others (at least the Complutensian) eis to hen eisin
- are to one, or agree in one; and in [Jo1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#008.md) (in that part that it is supposed
should be admitted), instead of the common en tē gē - in earth, the
Complutensian reads epi tēs gēs - upon earth, which seems to show that
that edition depended upon some Greek authority, and not merely, as some
would have us believe, upon the authority either of the vulgar Latin or
of Thomas Aquinas, though his testimony may be added thereto.

(4.) The seventh verse is very agreeable to the style and the theology
of our apostle; as, \[1.\] He delights in the title the Father, whether
he indicates thereby God only, or a divine person distinguished from the
Son. I and the Father are one. And Yet I am not alone; because the
Father is with me. I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
comforter. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in
him. Grace be with you, and peace from God the Father, and from the Lord
Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, [Jo2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#003.md). Then, \[2.\] The name the Word is
known to be almost (if not quite) peculiar to this apostle. Had the text
been devised by another, it had been more easy and obvious, from the
form of baptism, and the common language of the church, to have used the
name Son instead of that of the Word. As it is observed that Tertullian
and Cyprian use that name, even when they refer to this verse; or it is
made an objection against their referring to this verse, because they
speak of the Son, not the Word; and yet Cyprian's expression seems to be
very clear by the citation of Facundus himself. Quod Johannis apostoli
testimonium beatus Cyprianus, Carthaginensis antistes et martyr, in
epistol sive libro, quem de Trinitate scripsit, de Patre, Filio, et
Spiritu sancto dictum intelligit; ait enim, Dicit Dominus, Ego et Pater
unum sumus; et iterum de Patre, Filio, et Spiritu sancto scriptum est,
Et hi tres unum sunt. - Blessed Cyprian, the Carthaginian bishop and
martyr, in the epistle or book he wrote concerning the Trinity,
considered the testimony of the apostle John as relating to the Father,
the Son, and Holy Spirit; for he says, the Lord says, I and the Father
are one; and again, of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit it is
written, And these three are one. Now it is nowhere written that these
are one, but in [Jo1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#007.md). It is
probable than that St. Cyprian, either depending on his memory, or
rather intending things more than words, persons more than names, or
calling persons by their names more usual in the church (both in popular
and polemic discourses), called the second by the name of the Son rather
than of the Word. If any man can admit Facundus's fancy, that Cyprian
meant that the Spirit, the water, and the blood, were indeed the Father,
Word, and Spirit, that John said were one, he may enjoy his opinion to
himself. For, First, He must suppose that Cyprian not only changed all
the names, but the apostle's order too. For the blood (the Son), which
Cyprian puts second, the apostle puts last. And, Secondly, He must
suppose that Cyprian thought that by the blood which issued out of the
side of the Son the apostle intended the Son himself, who might as well
have been denoted by the water, - that by the water, which also issued
from the side of the Son, the apostle intended the person of the Holy
Ghost, - that by the Spirit, which in v. 6 is said to be truth, and in
the gospel is called the Spirit of truth, the apostle meant the person
of the Father, though he is nowhere else so called when joined with the
Son and the Holy Ghost. We require good proof that the Carthaginian
father could so understand the apostle. He who so understands him must
believe too that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, are said to be three
witnesses on earth. Thirdly, Facundus acknowledges that Cyprian says
that of his three it is written, Et hi tres unum sunt - and these three
are one. Now these are the words, not of [Jo1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#008.md), but of [Jo1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#007.md). They are not used concerning the
three on earth, the Spirit, the water, and the blood; but the three in
heaven, the Father, and the Word, and the Holy Ghost. So we are told
that the author of the book De baptismo haereticorum, allowed to be
contemporary with Cyprian, cites John's words, agreeably to the Greek
manuscripts and the ancient versions, thus: Ait enim Johannes de Domino
nostro in epistol nos docens, Hic es qui venit per aquam et sanguinem,
Jesus Christus, non in aqu tantum, sed in aqu et sanguine; et Spiritus
est qui testimonium perhibet, quia Spiritus est veritas; quia tres
testimonium perhibent, Spiritus et aqua et sanguis, et isti tres in unum
sunt - For John, in his epistle, says concerning our Lord, This is he,
Jesus Christ, who came by water and blood, not in water only, but in
water and blood; and it is the Spirit that bears witness, because the
Spirit is truth; for there are three that bear witness, the Spirit, the
water, and the blood, and these three agree in one. If all the Greek
manuscripts and ancient versions say concerning the Spirit, the water,
and the blood, that in unum sunt - they agree in one, then it was not of
them that Cyprian spoke, whatever variety there might be in the copies
in his time, when he said it is written, unum sunt - they are one. And
therefore Cyprian's words seem still to be a firm testimony to v. 7, and
an intimation likewise that a forger of the text would have scarcely so
exactly hit upon the apostolical name for the second witness in heaven,
the Word. Them, \[3.\] As only this apostle records the history of the
water and blood flowing out of the Saviour's side, so it is he only, or
he principally, who registers to us the Saviour's promise and prediction
of the Holy spirit's coming to glorify him, and to testify of him, and
to convince the world of its own unbelief and of his righteousness, as
in his gospel, [Joh 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016.md), [Joh
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#017.md), [Joh
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026.md); [Joh
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026.md); [Joh
16:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007.md). It is most suitable then to
the diction and to the gospel of this apostle thus to mention the Holy
Ghost as a witness for Jesus Christ. Then,

(5.) It was far more easy for a transcriber, by turning away his eye, or
by the obscurity of the copy, it being obliterated or defaced on the top
or bottom of a page, or worn away in such materials as the ancients had
to write upon, to lose and omit the passage, than for an interpolator to
devise and insert it. He must be very bold and impudent who could hope
to escape detection and shame; and profane too, who durst venture to
make an addition to a supposed sacred book. And,

(6.) It can scarcely be supposed that, when the apostle is representing
the Christian's faith in overcoming the world, and the foundation it
relies upon in adhering to Jesus Christ, and the various testimony that
was attended him, especially when we consider that he meant to infer, as
he does ([Jo1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#009).md), If we receive the
witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for this (which he had
rehearsed before) is the witness of God which he hath testified of his
Son. Now in the three witnesses on earth there is neither all the
witness of God, nor indeed any witness who is truly and immediately God.
The antitrinitarian opposers of the text will deny that either the
Spirit, or the water, or the blood, is God himself; but, upon our
present reading, here is a noble enumeration of the several witnesses
and testimonies supporting the truth of the Lord Jesus and the divinity
of his institution. Here is the most excellent abridgment or breviate of
the motives to faith in Christ, of the credentials the Saviour brings
with him, and of the evidences of our Christianity, that is to be found,
I think, in the book of God, upon which single account, even waiving the
doctrine of the divine Trinity, the text is worthy of all acceptation.

2\. Having these rational grounds on out side, we proceed. The apostle,
having told us that the Spirit that bears witness to Christ is truth,
shows us that he is so, by assuring us that he is in heaven, and that
there are others also who cannot but be true, or truth itself,
concurring in testimony with him: For there are three that bear record
in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are
one, [Jo1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#007.md).

(1.) Here is a trinity of heavenly witnesses, such as have testified and
vouched to the world the veracity and authority of the Lord Jesus in his
office and claims, where, \[1.\] The first that occurs in order is the
Father; he set his seal to the commission of the Lord Christ all the
while he was here; more especially, First, In proclaiming him at his
baptism, [Mat 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017.md). Secondly, In
confirming his character at the transfiguration, [Mat
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#005.md). Thirdly, In accompanying him
with miraculous power and works: If I do not the works of my Father,
believe me not; but if I do, though you believe not me, believe the
works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in
him, [Joh 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#037.md), [Joh
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#038.md). Fourthly, In avouching at his
death, [Mat 27:54](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#054.md). Fifthly, In raising
him from the dead, and receiving him up to his glory: He shall convince
the world - of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and you see me
no more, [Joh 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#010.md), and [Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004.md). \[2.\] The second witness in the
Word, a mysterious name, importing the highest nature that belongs to
the Saviour of Jesus Christ, wherein he existed before the world was,
whereby he made the world, and whereby he was truly God with the Father.
He must bear witness to the human nature, or to the man Christ Jesus, in
and by whom he redeemed and saved us; and he bore witness, First, By the
mighty works that he wrought. [Joh
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#017.md), My Father worketh hitherto, and
I work. Secondly, In conferring a glory upon him at his transfiguration.
And we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the
Father, [Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md). Thirdly, In raising
him from the dead. [Joh 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019.md), Destroy
this temple, and in three days will I raise it up. \[3.\] The third
witness is the Holy Ghost, or the Holy Spirit, and august, venerable
name, the possessor, proprietor, and author of holiness. True and
faithful must he be to whom the Spirit of holiness sets his seal and
solemn testimony. So he did to the Lord Jesus, the head of the Christian
world; and that in such instances as these: - First, In the miraculous
production of his immaculate human nature in the virgin's womb. The Holy
Ghost shall come upon thee, [Luk 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035.md),
etc. Secondly, In the visible descent upon him at his baptism. The Holy
Ghost descended in a bodily shape, [Luk
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#022.md), etc. Thirdly, In an effectual
conquest of the spirits of hell and darkness. If I cast out devils by
the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come unto you, [Mat
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#028.md). Fourthly, In the visible potent
descent upon the apostles, to furnish them with gifts and powers to
preach him and his gospel to the world after he himself had gone to
heaven, [Act 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#004.md), [Act
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#005.md); [Act
2:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#002.md), etc. Fifthly, In supporting the
name, gospel, and interest of Christ, by miraculous gifts and operations
by and upon the disciples, and in the churches, for two hundred years
([Co1 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#007).md), concerning which see Dr.
Whitby's excellent discourse in the preface to the second volume of his
Commentary on the New Testament. These are witnesses in heaven; and they
bear record from heaven; and they are one, it should seem, not only in
testimony (for that is implied in their being three witnesses to one and
the same thing), but upon a higher account, as they are in heaven; they
are one in their heavenly being and essence; and, if one with the
Father, they must be one God.

(2.) To these there is opposed, though with them joined, a trinity of
witnesses on earth, such as continue here below: And there are three
that bear witness on earth, the spirit, the water, and the blood; and
these three agree in one, [Jo1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#008.md).
\[1.\] Of these witnesses the first is the spirit. This must be
distinguished from the person of the Holy Ghost, who is in heaven. We
must say then, with the Saviour (according to what is reported by this
apostle), that which is born of the Spirit is spirit, [Joh
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006.md). The disciples of the Saviour are,
as well as others, born after the flesh. They come into the world endued
with a corrupt carnal disposition, which is enmity to God. This
disposition must be mortified and abolished. A new nature must be
communicated. Old lusts and corruptions must be eradicated, and the true
disciple become a new creature. The regeneration or renovation of souls
is a testimony to the Saviour. It is his actual though initial
salvation. It is a testimony on earth, because it continues with the
church here, and is not performed in that conspicuous astonishing manner
in which signs from heaven are accomplished. To this Spirit belong not
only the regeneration and conversion of the church, but its progressive
sanctification, victory over the world, her peace, and love, and joy,
and all that grace by which she is made meet for the inheritance of the
saints in light. \[2.\] The second is the water. This was before
considered as a means of salvation, now as a testimony to the Saviour
himself, and intimates his purity and purifying power. And so it seems
to comprehend, First, The purity of his own nature and conduct in the
world. He was holy, harmless, and undefiled. Secondly, The testimony of
John's baptism, who bore witness of him, prepared a people for him, and
referred them to him, [Mar 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#004.md), [Mar
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#007.md), [Mar
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#008.md). Thirdly, The purity of his own
doctrine, by which souls are purified and washed. Now you are clean
through the word that I have spoken unto you, [Joh
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#003.md). Fourthly, The actual and active
purity and holiness of his disciples. His body is the holy catholic
church. Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through
the Spirit, [Pe1 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022.md). And this signed
and sealed by, Fifthly, The baptism that he has appointed for the
initiation or introduction of his disciples, in which he signally (or by
that sign) says, Except I wash thee, thou hast no part in me. Not the
putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good
conscience towards God, [Pe1 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021.md).
\[3.\] The third witness is the blood; this he shed, and this was our
ransom. This testifies for Jesus Christ, First, In that it sealed up and
finished the sacrifices of the Old Testament, Christ, our Passover, was
sacrificed for us. Secondly, In that it confirmed his own predictions,
and the truth of all his ministry and doctrine, [Joh
18:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#037.md). Thirdly, In that it showed
unparalleled love to God, in that he would die a sacrifice to his honour
and glory, in making atonement for the sins of the world, [Joh
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030.md), [Joh
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#031.md). Fourthly, In that it
demonstrated unspeakable love to us; and none will deceive those whom
they entirely love, [Joh 14:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#013.md).
Fifthly, In that it demonstrated the disinterestedness of the Lord Jesus
as to any secular interest and advantage. No impostor and deceiver ever
proposes to himself contempt and a violent cruel death, [Joh
18:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036.md). Sixthly, In that it lays
obligation on his disciple to suffer and die for him. No deceiver would
invite proselytes to his side and interest at the rate that the Lord
Jesus did. You shall be hated of all men for my sake. They shall put you
out of their synagogues; and the time comes that whosoever kills you
will think that he doeth God service, [Joh
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#002.md). He frequently calls his servants
to a conformity with him in sufferings: Let us go forth therefore unto
him without the camp, bearing his reproach, [Heb
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#013.md). This shows that neither he nor
his kingdom is of this world. Seventhly, The benefits accruing and
procured by his blood (well understood) must immediately demonstrate
that he is indeed the Saviour of the world. And then, Eighthly, These
are signified and sealed in the institution of his own supper: This is
my blood of the New Testament (which ratifies the New Testament), which
is shed for many, for the remission of sins, [Mat
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#028.md). Such are the witnesses on
earth. Such is the various testimony given to the author of our
religion. No wonder if the rejector of all this evidence he judged as a
blasphemer of the Spirit of God, and be left to perish without remedy in
his sins. These three witnesses (being more different than the three
former) are not so properly said to be one as to be for one, to be for
one and the same purpose and cause, or to agree in one, in one and the
same thing among themselves, and in the same testimony with those who
bear record from heaven.

III\. The apostle justly concludes, If we receive the witness of men,
the witness of God is greater; for this is the witness of God, that he
hath testified of his Son, [Jo1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#009.md).
Here we have, 1. A supposition well founded upon the premises. Here is
the witness of God, the witness whereby God hath testified of his Son,
which surely must intimate some immediate irrefragable testimony, and
that of the Father concerning his Son; he has by himself proclaimed and
avouched him to the world. 2. The authority and acceptableness of his
testimony; and that argued from the less to the greater: If we receive
the witness of men (and such testimony is and must be admitted in all
judicatories and in all nations), the witness of God is greater. It is
truth itself, of highest authority and most unquestionable
infallibility. And then there is, 3. The application of the rule to the
present case: For this is the witness, and here is the witness of God
even of the Father, as well as of the Word and Spirit, which he hath
testified of, and wherein he hath attested, his Son. God, that cannot
lie, hath given sufficient assurance to the world that Jesus Christ is
his Son, the Son of his love, and Son by office, to reconcile and
recover the world unto himself; he testified therefore the truth and
divine origin of the Christian religion, and that it is the sure
appointed way and means of bringing us to God.

[1 John 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jo1 5:10</span></span>

In those words we may observe,

I. The privilege and stability of the real Christian: He that believeth
on the Son of God, hath been prevailed with unfeignedly to cleave to him
for salvation, hath the witness in himself, [Jo1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#010.md). He hath not only the outward
evidence that others have, but he hath in his own heart a testimony for
Jesus Christ. He can allege what Christ and the truth of Christ have
done for his soul and what he has seen and found in him. As, 1. He has
deeply seen his sin, and guilt, and misery, and his abundant need of
such a Saviour. 2. He has seen the excellency, beauty, and office of the
Son of God, and the incomparable suitableness of such a Saviour to all
his spiritual wants and sorrowful circumstances. 3. He sees and admires
the wisdom and love of God in preparing and sending such a Saviour to
deliver him from sin and hell, and to raise him to pardon, peace, and
communion with God. 4. He has found and felt the power of the word and
doctrine of Christ, wounding, humbling, healing, quickening, and
comforting his soul. 5. He finds that the revelation of Christ, as it is
the greatest discovery and demonstration of the love of God, so it is
the most apt and powerful means of kindling, fomenting, and inflaming
love to the holy blessed God. 6. He is born of God by the truth of
Christ, as [Jo1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001.md). He has a new
heart and nature, a new love, disposition, and delight, and is not the
man that formerly he was. 7. He finds yet such a conflict with himself,
with sin, with the flesh, the world, and invisible wicked powers, as is
described and provided for in the doctrine of Christ. 8. He finds such
prospects and such strength afforded him by the faith of Christ, that he
can despise and overcome the world, and travel on towards a better. 9.
He finds what interest the Mediator has in heaven, by the audiency and
prevalency of those prayers that are sent thither in his name, according
to his will, and through his intercession. 10. He is begotten again to a
lively hope, to a holy confidence in God, in his good-will and love, to
a pleasant victory over terrors of conscience, dread of death and hell,
to a comfortable prospect of life and immortality, being enriched with
the earnest of the Spirit and sealed to the day of redemption. Such
assurance has the gospel believer; he has a witness in himself. Christ
is formed in him, and he is growing up to the fulness and perfection, or
perfect image of Christ, in heaven.

II\. The aggravation of the unbeliever's sin, the sin of unbelief: He
that believeth not God hath made him a liar. He does, in effect, give
God the lie, because he believeth not the record that God gave of his
Son, [Jo1 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#010.md). He must believe that
God did not send his Son into the world, when he has given us such
manifold evidence that he did, or that Jesus Christ was not the Son of
God, when all that evidence relates to and terminates upon him, or that
he sent his Son to deceive the world and to lead it into error and
misery, or that he permits men to devise a religion which, in all the
parts of it, is a pure, holy, heavenly, undefiled institution, and so
worthy to be embraced by the reason of mankind, and yet is but a
delusion and a lie, and then lends them his Spirit and power to
recommend and obtrude it upon the world, which is to make God the
Father, the author and abettor, of the lie.

III\. The matter, the substance, or contents of all this divine
testimony concerning Jesus Christ: And this is the record, that God hath
given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son, [Jo1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#011.md). This is the sum of the gospel.
This is the sum and epitome of the whole record given us by all the
aforesaid six witnesses. 1. That God hath given to us eternal life. He
has designed it for us in his eternal purpose. He has prepared all the
means that are necessary to bring us to it. He has made it over to us by
his covenant and promise. And he actually confers a right and title
thereto on all who believe on and actually embrace the Son of God. Then,
2. This life is in the Son. The Son is life; eternal life in his own
essence and person, [Joh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004.md); [Jo1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002.md). He is eternal life to us, the
spring of our spiritual and glorious life, [Col
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004.md). From him life is communicated to
us, both here in heaven. And thereupon it must follow, (1.) He that hath
the Son hath life, [Jo1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#012.md). He that
is united to the Son is united to life. He who hath a title to the Son
hath a title to life, to eternal life. Such honour hath the Father put
upon the Son: such honour must we put upon him too. We must come and
kiss the Son, and we shall have life. (2.) He that hath not the Son of
God hath not life, [Jo1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#012.md). He
continues under the condemnation of the law ([Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036).md); he refuses the Son, who is life
itself, who is the procurer of life, and the way to it; he provokes God
to deliver him over to endless death for making him a liar, since he
believes not this record that God hath given concerning his Son.

IV\. The end and reason of the apostle's preaching this to believers. 1.
For their satisfaction and comfort: These things have I written unto you
that believe on the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you
have eternal life, [Jo1 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#013.md). Upon all
this evidence, and these witnesses, it is but just and meet that there
should be those who believe on the name of the Son of God. God increase
their number! How much testimony from heaven has the world to answer
for! And to three witnesses in heaven must the world be accountable.
These believers have eternal life. They have it in the covenant of the
gospel, in the beginning and first-fruits of it within them, and in
their Lord and head in heaven. These believers may come to know that
they have eternal life, and should be quickened, encouraged, and
comforted, in the prospect of it: and they should value the scriptures,
which are so much written for their consolation and salvation. 2. For
their confirmation and progress in their holy faith: And that you may
believe on the name of the Son of God ([Jo1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#013).md), may go on believing. Believers
must persevere, or they do nothing. To withdraw from believing on the
name of the Son of God is to renounce eternal life, and draw back unto
perdition. Therefore the evidences of religion and the advantage of
faith are to be presented to believers, in order to hearten and
encourage them to persevere to the end.

[1 John 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jo1 5:14</span></span>

Here we have,

I. A privilege belonging to faith in Christ, namely, audience in prayer:
This is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing
according to his will, he heareth us, [Jo1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014.md). The Lord Christ emboldens us to
come to God in all circumstances, with all our supplications and
requests. Through him our petitions are admitted and accepted of God.
The matter of our prayer must be agreeable to the declared will of God.
It is not fit that we should ask what is contrary either to his majesty
and glory or to our own good, who are his and dependent on him. And then
we may have confidence that the prayer of faith shall be heard in
heaven.

II\. The advantage accruing to us by such privilege: If we know that he
heareth us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that
we desired of him, [Jo1 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#015.md). Great
are the deliverances, mercies, and blessings, which the holy petitioner
needs. To know that his petitions are heard or accepted is as good as to
know that they are answered; and therefore that he is so pitied,
pardoned, or counselled, sanctified, assisted, and saved (or shall be
so) as he is allowed to ask of God.

III\. Direction in prayer in reference to the sins of others: If any man
see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he
shall give him life for those that sin not unto death. There is a sin
unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it, [Jo1
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#016.md). Here we may observe, 1. We ought
to pray for others as well as for ourselves; for our brethren of
mankind, that they may be enlightened, converted, and saved; for our
brethren in the Christian profession, that they may be sincere, that
their sins may be pardoned, and that they may be delivered from evils
and the chastisements of God, and preserved in Christ Jesus. 2. There is
a great distinction in the heinousness and guilt of sin: There is a sin
unto death ([Jo1 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#016).md), and there is a
sin not unto death, [Jo1 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#017). (1..md)
There is a sin unto death. All sin, as to the merit and legal sentence
of it, is unto death. The wages of sin is death; and cursed is every one
that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the
law, to do them, [Gal 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010.md). But there
is a sin unto death in opposition to such sin as is here said not to be
unto death. There is therefore, (2.) A sin not unto death. This surely
must include all such sin as by divine or human constitution may consist
with life; in the human constitution with temporal or corporal life, in
the divine constitution with corporal or with spiritual evangelical
life. \[1.\] There are sins which, by human righteous constitution, are
not unto death; as divers pieces of injustice, which may be compensated
without the death of the delinquent. In opposition to this there are
sins which, by righteous constitution, are to death, or to a legal
forfeiture of life; such as we call capital crimes. \[2.\] Then there
are sins which, by divine constitution, are unto death; and that either
death corporal or spiritual and evangelical. First, Such as are, or may
be, to death corporal. Such may the sins be either of gross hypocrites,
as Ananias and Sapphira, or, for aught we know, of sincere Christian
brethren, as when the apostle says of the offending members of the
church of Corinth, For this cause many are weak and sickly among you,
and many sleep, [Co1 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#030.md). There may
be sin unto corporal death among those who may not be condemned with the
world. Such sin, I said, is, or may be, to corporal death. The divine
penal constitution in the gospel does not positively and peremptorily
threaten death to the more visible sins of the members of Christ, but
only some gospel-chastisement; for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth,
and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth, [Heb
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#006.md). There is room left for divine
wisdom or goodness, or even gospel severity, to determine how far the
chastisement or the scourge shall proceed. And we cannot say but that
sometimes it may (in terrorem - for warning to others) proceed even to
death. Then, Secondly, There are sins which, by divine constitution, are
unto death spiritual and evangelical, that is, are inconsistent with
spiritual and evangelical life, with spiritual life in the soul and with
an evangelical right to life above. Such are total impenitence and
unbelief for the present. Final impenitence and unbelief are infallibly
to death eternal, as also a blaspheming of the Spirit of God in the
testimony that he has given to Christ and his gospel, and a total
apostasy from the light and convictive evidence of the truth of the
Christian religion. These are sins involving the guilt of everlasting
death. Then comes,

IV\. The application of the direction for prayer according to the
different sorts of sin thus distinguished. The prayer is supposed to be
for life: He shall ask, and he (God) shall give them life. Life is to be
asked of God. He is the God of life; he gives it when and to whom he
pleases, and takes it away either by his constitution or providence, or
both, as he thinks meet. In the case of a brother's sin, which is not
(in the manner already mentioned) unto death, we may in faith and hope
pray for him; and particularly for the life of soul and body. But, in
case of the sin unto death in the forementioned ways, we have no
allowance to pray. Perhaps the apostle's expression, I do not say, He
shall pray for it, may intend no more than, "I have no promise for you
in that case; no foundation for the prayer of faith." 1. The laws of
punitive justice must be executed, for the common safety and benefit of
mankind: and even an offending brother in such a case must be resigned
to public justice (which in the foundation of it is divine), and at the
same time also to the mercy of God. 2. The removal of evangelical
penalties (as they may be called), or the prevention of death (which may
seem to be so consequential upon, or inflicted for, some particular
sin), can be prayed for only conditionally or provisionally, that is,
with proviso that it consist with the wisdom, will, and glory of God
that they should be removed, and particularly such death prevented. 3.
We cannot pray that the sins of the impenitent and unbelieving should,
while they are such, be forgiven them, or that any mercy of life or
soul, that suppose the forgiveness of sin, should be granted to them,
while they continue such. But we may pray for their repentance
(supposing them but in the common case of the impenitent world), for
their being enriched with faith in Christ, and thereupon for all other
saving mercies. 4. In case it should appear that any have committed the
irremissible blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, and the total apostasy
from the illuminating convictive powers of the Christian religion, it
should seem that they are not to be prayed for at all. For what remains
but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, to consume such
adversaries? [Heb 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#027.md). And these
last seem to be the sins chiefly intended by the apostle by the name of
sins unto death. Then, 5. The apostle seems to argue that there is sin
that is not unto death; thus, All unrighteousness is sin ([Jo1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#017).md); but, were all unrighteousness
unto death (since we have all some unrighteousness towards God or man,
or both, in omitting and neglecting something that is their due), then
we were all peremptorily bound over to death, and, since it is not so
(the Christian brethren, generally speaking, having right to life),
there must be sin that is not to death. Though there is no venial sin
(in the common acceptation), there is pardoned sin, sin that does not
involve a plenary obligation to eternal death. If it were not so, there
could be no justification nor continuance of the justified state. The
gospel constitution or covenant abbreviates, abridges, or rescinds the
guilt of sin.

[1 John 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jo1 5:18</span></span>

Here we have,

I. A recapitulation of the privileges and advantages of sound Christian
believers. 1. They are secured against sin, against the fulness of its
dominion or the fulness of its guilt: We know that whosoever is born of
God (and the believer in Christ is born of God, [Jo1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001).md) sinneth not ([Jo1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018).md), sinneth not with that fulness
of heart and spirit that the unregenerate do (as was said [Jo1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#006.md), [Jo1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#009).md), and consequently not with that
fulness of guilt that attends the sins of others; and so he is secured
against that sin which is unavoidably unto death, or which infallibly
binds the sinner over unto the wages of eternal death; the new nature,
and the inhabitation of the divine Spirit thereby, prevent the admission
of such unpardonable sin. 2. They are fortified against the devil's
destructive attempts: He that is begotten of God keepeth himself, that
is, is enabled to guard himself, and the wicked one toucheth him not
([Jo1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018).md), that is, that the wicked
one may not touch him, namely, to death. It seems not to be barely a
narration of the duty or the practice of the regenerate; but an
indication of their power by virtue of their regeneration. They are
thereby prepared and principled against the fatal touches, the sting, of
the wicked one; he touches not their souls, to infuse his venom there a
he does in others, or to expel that regenerative principle which is an
antidote to his poison, or to induce them to that sin which by the
gospel constitution conveys an indissoluble obligation to eternal death.
He may prevail too far with them, to draw them to some acts of sin; but
it seems to be the design of the apostle to assert that their
regeneration secures them from such assaults of the devil as will bring
them into the same case and actual condemnation with the devil. 3. they
are on God's side and interest, in opposition to the state of the world:
And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness,
[Jo1 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019.md). Mankind are divided into
two great parties of dominions, that which belongs to God and that which
belongs to wickedness or to the wicked one. The Christian believers
belong to God. They are of God, and from him, and to him, and for him.
They succeed into the right and room of the ancient Israel of God, of
whom it is said, The Lord's people is his portion, his estate in this
world; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance, the dividend that has fallen
to him by the lot of his own determination ([Deu
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009).md); while, on the contrary, the
whole world, the rest, being by far the major part, lieth in wickedness,
in the jaws in the bowels of the wicked one. There are, indeed, were we
to consider the individuals, many wicked ones, many wicked spirits, in
the heavenly or the ethereal places; but they are united in wicked
nature, policy, and principle, and they are united also in one head.
there is the prince of the devils and of the diabolical kingdom. There
is a head of the malignity and of the malignant world; and he has such
sway here that he is called the god of this world. Strange that such a
knowing spirit should be so implacably incensed against the Almighty and
all his interests, when he cannot but know that it must end in his own
overthrow and everlasting damnation! How tremendous is the judgment of
God upon that wicked one! May the God of the Christian world continually
demolish his dominion in this world, and translate souls into the
kingdom of his dear Son! 4. They are enlightened in the knowledge of the
true eternal God: "And we know that the Son of God has come, and has
given as an understanding, that we may know him that is true, [Jo1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020.md). The Son of God has come into our
world, and we have seen him, and know him by all the evidence that has
already been asserted; he has revealed unto us the true God (as [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018).md), and he has opened our minds too
to understand that revelation, given us an internal light in our
understandings, whereby we may discern the glories of the true God; and
we are assured that it is the true God that he hath discovered to us. He
is infinitely superior in purity, power, and perfection, to all the gods
of the Gentiles. He has all the excellences, beauties, and riches, of
the living and true God. It is the same God that, according to Moses's
account, made the heavens and the earth, the same who took our fathers
and patriarchs into peculiar covenant with himself, the same who brought
our ancestors out of Egypt, who gave us the fiery law upon mount Sinai,
who gave us his holy oracles, promised the call and conversion of the
Gentiles. By his counsels and works, by his love and grace, by his
terrors and judgments, we know that he, and he alone, in the fulness of
his being, is the living and true God." It is a great happiness to know
the true God, to know him in Christ; it is eternal lie, [Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md). It is the glory of the Christian
revelation that it gives the best account of the true God, and
administers the best eye-salve for our discerning the living and true
God. 5. They have a happy union with God and his Son: "And we are in him
that is true, even (or and) in his Son Jesus Christ, [Jo1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020.md). The Son leads us to the Father,
and we are in both, in the love and favour of both, in covenant and
federal alliance with both, in spiritual conjunction with both by the
inhabitation and operation of their Spirit: and, that you may know how
great a dignity and felicity this is, you must remember that this true
one is the true God and eternal life" or rather (as it should seem a
more natural construction), "This same Son of God is himself also the
true God and eternal life" ([Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md),
and here, [Jo1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002).md), "so that in union
with either, much more with both, we are united to the true God and
eternal life." Then we have,

II\. The apostle's concluding monition: "Little children" (dear
children, as it has been interpreted), "keep yourselves from idols, [Jo1
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#021.md). Since you know the true God, and
are in him, let your light and love guard you against all that is
advanced in opposition to him, or competition with him. Flee from the
false gods of the heathen world. They are not comparable to the God
whose you are and whom you serve. Adore not your God by statues and
images, which share in his worship. Your God is an incomprehensible
Spirit, and is disgraced by such sordid representations. Hold no
communion with your heathen neighbours in their idolatrous worship. Your
God is jealous, and would have you come out, and be separated from among
them; mortify the flesh, and be crucified to the world, that they may
not usurp the throne of dominion in the heart, which is due only to God.
The God whom you have known is he who made you, who redeemed you by his
Son, who has sent his gospel to you, who has pardoned your sins,
begotten you unto himself by his Spirit, and given you eternal life.
Cleave to him in faith, and love, and constant obedience, in opposition
to all things that would alienate your mind and heart from God. To this
living and true God be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen."
