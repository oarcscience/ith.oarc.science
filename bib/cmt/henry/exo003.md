### [Exodus Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 3:0</span></span>

As prophecy had ceased for many ages before the coming of Christ, that
the revival and perfection of it in that great prophet might be the more
remarkable, so vision had ceased (for aught that appears) among the
patriarchs for some ages before the coming of Moses, that God's
appearances to him for Israel's salvation might be the more welcome; and
in this chapter we have God's first appearance to him in the bush and
the conference between God and Moses in that vision. Here is, I. The
discovery God was pleased to make of his glory to Moses at the bush, to
which Moses was forbidden to approach too near ([Exo
3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001).md). II. A general declaration of
God's grace and good-will to his people, who were beloved for their
fathers' sakes ([Exo 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#006).md). III. A
particular notification of God's purpose concerning the deliverance of
Israel out of Egypt. 1. He assures Moses it should now be done ([Exo
3:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#007).md). 2. He gives him a commission
to act in it as his ambassador both to Pharaoh ([Exo
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#010).md) and to Israel ([Exo
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#016).md). 3. He answers the objection
Moses made of his own unworthiness ([Exo
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#011.md), [Exo
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#012).md). 4. He gives him full
instructions what to say both to Pharaoh and to Israel ([Exo
3:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#013).md). 5. He tells him beforehand
what the issue would be ([Exo 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#019.md),
etc.).

[Exodus 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 3:1</span></span>

The years of the life of Moses are remarkably divided into three
forties: the first forty he spent as a prince in Pharaoh's court, the
second a shepherd in Midian, the third a king in Jeshurun; so changeable
is the life of men, especially the life of good men. He had now finished
his second forty, when he received his commission to bring Israel out of
Egypt. Note, Sometimes it is long before God calls his servants out of
that work which of old he designed them for, and has been graciously
preparing them for. Moses was born to be Israel's deliverer, and yet not
a word is said of it to him till he is eighty years of age. Now obverve,

I. How this appearance of God to him found him employed. He was keeping
the flock (tending sheep) near mount Horeb, [Exo
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001.md). This was a poor employment for a
man of his parts and education, yet he rests satisfied with it, and thus
learns meekness and contentment to a high degree, for which he is more
celebrated in sacred writ than for all his other learning. Note, 1. In
the calling to which we are called we should abide, and not be given to
change. 2. Even those that are qualified for great employments and
services must not think it strange if they be confined to obscurity; it
was the lot of Moses before them, who foresaw nothing to the contrary
but that he should die, as he had lived a great while, a poor despicable
shepherd. Let those that think themselves buried alive be content to
shine like lamps in their sepulchres, and wait till God's time come for
setting them on a candlestick. Thus employed Moses was, when he was
honoured with this vision. Note, (1.) God will encourage industry. The
shepherds were keeping their flocks when they received the tidings of
our Saviour's birth, [Luk 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#008.md). Satan
loves to find us idle; God is well pleased when he find us employed.
(2.) Retirement is a good friend to our communion with God. When we are
alone, the Father is with us. Moses saw more of God in a desert than
ever he had seen in Pharaoh's court.

II\. What the appearance was. To his great surprise he saw a bush
burning, when he perceived no fire either from earth or heaven to kindle
it, and, which was more strange, it did not consume, [Exo
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002.md). It was an angel of the Lord that
appeared to him; some think, a created angel, who speaks in the language
of him that sent him; others, the second person, the angel of the
covenant, who is himself Jehovah. It was an extraordinary manifestation
of the divine presence and glory; what was visible was produced by the
ministry of an angel, but he heard God in it speaking to him. 1. He saw
a flame of fire; for our God is a consuming fire. When Israel's
deliverance out of Egypt was promised to Abraham, he saw a burning lamp,
which signified the light of joy which that deliverance should cause
([Gen 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#017).md); but now it shines
brighter, as a flame of fire, for God in that deliverance brought terror
and destruction to his enemies, light and heat to his people, and
displayed his glory before all. See [Isa
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#017.md). 2. This fire was not in a tall
and stately cedar, but in a bush, a thorny bush, so the word signifies;
for God chooses the weak and despised things of the world (such as
Moses, now a poor shepherd), with them to confound the wise; he delights
to beautify and crown the humble. 3. The bush burned, and yet was not
consumed, an emblem of the church now in bondage in Egypt, burning in
the brick-kilns, yet not consumed; perplexed, but not in despair; cast
down, but not destroyed.

III\. The curiosity Moses had to enquire into this extraordinary sight:
I will turn aside and see, [Exo 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#003.md).
He speaks as one inquisitive and bold in his enquiry; whatever it was,
he would, if possible, know the meaning of it. Note, Things revealed
belong to us, and we ought diligently to enquire into them.

IV\. The invitation he had to draw near, yet with a caution not to come
too near, nor rashly.

1\. God gave him a gracious call, to which he returned a ready answer,
[Exo 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#004.md). When God saw that he took
notice of the burning bush, and turned aside to see it, and left his
business to attend it, then God called to him. If he had carelessly
neglected it as an ignis fatuus - a deceiving meteor, a thing not worth
taking notice of, it is probable that God would have departed, and said
nothing to him; but, when he turned aside, God called to him. Note,
Those that would have communion with God must attend upon him, and
approach to him, in those ordinances wherein he is pleased to manifest
himself, and his power and glory, though it be in a bush; they must come
to the treasure, though in an earthen vessel. Those that seek God
diligently shall find him, and find him their bountiful rewarder. Draw
nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. God called him by name,
Moses, Moses. This which he heard could not but surprise him much more
than what he saw. The word of the Lord always went along with the glory
of the Lord, for every divine vision was designed for divine revelation,
[Job 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#016.md), etc.; [Job
32:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#014.md). Divine calls are then
effectual, (1.) When the Spirit of God makes them particular, and calls
us by name. The word calls, Ho, every one! The Spirit, by the
application of that, calls, Ho, such a one! I know thee by name, [Exo
33:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#012). (2..md) When we return an obedient
answer to them, as Moses here, "Here am I, what saith my Lord unto his
servant? Here am I, not only to hear what is said, but to do what I am
bidden."

2\. God gave him a needful caution against rashness and irreverence in
his approach, (1.) He must keep his distance; draw near, but not too
near; so near as to hear, but not so near as to pry. His conscience must
be satisfied, but not his curiosity; and care must be taken that
familiarity do not breed contempt. Note, In all our approaches to God,
we ought to be deeply affected with the infinite distance there is
between us and God, [Ecc 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#002.md). Or this
may be taken as proper to the Old Testament dispensation, which was a
dispensation of darkness, bondage, and terror, from which the gospel
happily frees us, giving us boldness to enter into the holiest, and
inviting us to draw near. (2.) He must express his reverence, and his
readiness to obey: Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, as a servant.
Putting off the shoe was then what putting off the hat is now, a token
of respect and submission. "The ground, for the present, is holy ground,
made so by this special manifestation of the divine presence, during the
continuance of which it must retain this character; therefore tread not
on that ground with soiled shoes." Keep thy foot, [Ecc
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001.md). Note, We ought to approach to God
with a solemn pause and preparation; and, though bodily exercise alone
profits little, yet we ought to glorify God with our bodies, and to
express our inward reverence by a grave and reverent behaviour in the
worship of God, carefully avoiding everything that looks light, and
rude, and unbecoming the awfulness of the service.

V. The solemn declaration God made of his name, by which he would be
known to Moses: I am the God of thy father, [Exo
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#006.md). 1. He lets him know that it is
God who speaks to him, to engage his reverence and attention, his faith
and obedience; for this is enough to command all these: I am the Lord.
Let us always hear the word as the word of God, [Th1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013.md). 2. He will be known as the God
of his father, his pious father Amram, and the God of Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob, his ancestors, and the ancestors of all Israel, for whom God
was now about to appear. By this God designed, (1.) To instruct Moses in
the knowledge of another world, and to strengthen his belief of a future
state. Thus it is interpreted by our Lord Jesus, the best expositor of
scripture, who from this proves that the dead are raised, against the
Sadducees. Moses, says he, showed it at the bush ([Luk
20:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#037).md), that is, God there showed it
to him, and in him to us, [Mat 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#031.md),
etc. Abraham was dead, and yet God is the God of Abraham; therefore
Abraham's soul lives, to which God stands in relation; and, to make his
soul completely happy, his body must live again in due time. This
promise made unto the fathers, that God would be their God, must include
a future happiness; for he never did anything for them in this world
sufficient to answer to the vast extent and compass of that great word,
but, having prepared for them a city, he is not ashamed to be called
their God, [Heb 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016.md); and see [Act
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#006.md), [Act
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#007.md); [Act
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#015). (2..md) To assure Moses of the
fulfillment of all those particular promises made to the fathers. He may
confidently expect this, for by these words it appears that God
remembered his covenant, [Exo 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#024.md).
Note, \[1.\] God's covenant-relation to us as our God is the best
support in the worst of times, and a great encouragement to our faith in
particular promises. \[2.\] When we are conscious to ourselves of our
own great unworthiness we may take comfort from God's relation to our
fathers, [Ch2 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#006.md).

VI\. The solemn impression this made upon Moses: He hid his face, as one
both ashamed and afraid to look upon God. Now that he knew it was a
divine light his eyes were dazzled with it; he was not afraid of a
burning bush till he perceived that God was in it. Yea, though God
called himself the God of his father, and a God in covenant with him,
yet he was afraid. Note, 1. The more we see of God the more cause we
shall see to worship him with reverence and godly fear. 2. Even the
manifestations of God's grace and covenant-love should increase our
humble reverence of him.

[Exodus 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 3:7</span></span>

Now that Moses had put off his shoes (for, no doubt, he observed the
orders given him, [Exo 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#005).md), and
covered his face, God enters upon the particular business that was now
to be concerted, which was the bringing of Israel out of Egypt. Now,
after forty years of Israel's bondage and Moses's banishment, when we
may suppose both he and they began to despair, they of being delivered
and he of delivering them, at length, the time has come, even the year
of the redeemed. Note, God often comes for the salvation of his people
when they have done looking for him. Shall he find faith? [Luk
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#008.md).

Here is, I. The notice God takes of the afflictions of Israel ([Exo
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#007.md), [Exo
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#009).md): Seeing I have seen, not only, I
have surely seen, but I have strictly observed and considered the
matter. Three things God took cognizance of: - 1. Their sorrows, [Exo
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#007.md). It is likely they were not
permitted to make a remonstrance of their grievances to Pharaoh, nor to
seek relief against their task-masters in any of his courts, nor
scarcely durst complain to one another; but God observed their tears.
Note, Even the secret sorrows of God's people are known to him. 2. Their
cry: I have heard their cry ([Exo
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#007).md), it has come unto me, [Exo
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#009.md). Note, God is not deaf to the
cries of his afflicted people. 3. The tyranny of their persecutors: I
have seen the oppression, [Exo 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#009.md).
Note, As the poorest of the oppressed are not below God's cognizance, so
the highest and greatest of their oppressors are not above his check,
but he will surely visit for these things.

II\. The promise God makes of their speedy deliverance and enlargement:
I have come down to deliver them, [Exo
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008.md). 1. It denotes his resolution to
deliver them, and that his heart was upon it, so that it should be done
speedily and effectually, and by methods out of the common road of
providence: when God does something very extraordinary he is said to
come down to do it, as [Isa 64:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md). 2.
This deliverance was typical of our redemption by Christ, in which the
eternal Word did indeed come down from heaven to deliver us: it was his
errand into the world. He promises also their happy settlement in the
land of Canaan, that they should exchange bondage for liberty, poverty
for plenty, labour for rest, and the precarious condition of tenants at
will for the ease and honour of lords proprietors. Note, Whom God by his
grace delivers out of a spiritual Egypt he will bring to a heavenly
Canaan.

III\. The commission he gives to Moses in order hereunto, [Exo
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#010.md). He is not only sent as a prophet
to Israel, to assure them that they should speedily be delivered (even
that would have been a great favour), but he is sent as an ambassador to
Pharaoh, to treat with him, or rather as a herald at arms, to demand
their discharge, and to denounce war in case of refusal; and he is sent
as a prince to Israel, to conduct and command them. Thus is he taken
from following the ewes great with young, to a pastoral office much more
noble, as David, [Psa 78:71](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#071.md). Note, God
is the fountain of power, and the powers that be are ordained of him as
he pleases. The same hand that now fetched a shepherd out of a desert,
to be the planter of a Jewish church, afterwards fetched fishermen from
their ships, to be the planters of the Christian church, That the
excellency of the power might be of God.

[Exodus 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 3:11</span></span>

God, having spoken to Moses, allows him also a liberty of speech, which
he here improves; and,

I. He objects his own insufficiency for the service he was called to
([Exo 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#011).md): Who am I? He thinks
himself unworthy of the honour, and not par negotio - equal to the task.
He thinks he wants courage, and therefore cannot go to Pharaoh, to make
a demand which might cost the demandant his head: he thinks he wants
skill, and therefore cannot bring forth the children of Israel out of
Egypt; they are unarmed, undisciplined, quite dispirited, utterly unable
to help themselves; it is morally impossible to bring them out. 1. Moses
was incomparably the fittest of any man living for this work, eminent
for learning, wisdom, experience, valour, faith, holiness; and yet he
says, Who am I? Note, The more fit any person is for service commonly
the less opinion he has of himself: see [Jdg
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#008.md), etc. 2. The difficulties of the
work were indeed very great, enough to startle the courage and stagger
the faith of Moses himself. Note, Even wise and faithful instruments may
be much discouraged at the difficulties that lie in the way of the
church's salvation. 3. Moses had formerly been very courageous when he
slew the Egyptian, but now his heart failed him; for good men are not
always alike bold and zealous. 4. Yet Moses is the man that does it at
last; for God gives grace to the lowly. Modest beginnings are very good
presages.

II\. God answers this objection, [Exo
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#012.md). 1. He promises him his presence:
Certainly I will be with thee, and that is enough. Note, Those that are
weak in themselves may yet do wonders, being strong in the Lord and in
the power of his might; and those that are most diffident of themselves
may be most confident in God. God's presence puts an honour upon the
worthless, wisdom and strength into the weak and foolish, makes the
greatest difficulties dwindle to nothing, and is enough to answer all
objections. 2. He assures him of success, and that the Israelites should
serve God upon this mountain. Note, (1.) Those deliverances are most
valuable which open to us a door of liberty to serve God. (2.) If God
gives us opportunity and a heart to serve him, it is a happy and
encouraging earnest of further favours designed us.

III\. He begs instructions for the executing of his commission, and has
them, thoroughly to furnish him. He desires to know by what name God
would at this time make himself known, [Exo
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#013.md).

1\. He supposes the children of Israel would ask him, What is his name?
This they would ask either, (1.) To perplex Moses: he foresaw
difficulty, not only in dealing with Pharaoh, to make him willing to
part with them, but in dealing with them, to make them willing to
remove. They would be scrupulous and apt to cavil, would bid him produce
his commission, and probably this would be the trial: "Does he know the
name of God? Has he the watch-word?" Once he was asked, Who made thee a
judge? Then he had not his answer ready, and he would not be nonplussed
so again, but would be able to tell in whose name he came. Or, (2.) For
their own information. It is to be feared that they had grown very
ignorant in Egypt, by reason of their hard bondage, want of teachers,
and loss of the sabbath, so that they needed to be told the first
principles of the oracles of God. Or this question, What is his name?
amounted to an enquiry into the nature of the dispensation they were now
to expect: "How will God in it be known to us, and what may we depend
upon from him?"

2\. He desires instructions what answer to give them: "What shall I say
to them? What name shall I vouch to them for the proof of my authority?
I must have something great and extraordinary to say to them; what must
it be? If I must go, let me have full instructions, that I may not run
in vain." Note, (1.) It highly concerns those who speak to people in the
name of God to be well prepared beforehand. (2.) Those who would know
what to say must go to God, to the word of his grace and to the throne
of his grace, for instructions, [Eze
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#007.md); [Eze
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#004.md), [Eze
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#010.md), [Eze
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#017). (3..md) Whenever we have any thing
to do with God, it is desirable to know, and our duty to consider, what
is his name.

IV\. God readily gives him full instructions in this matter. Two names
God would now be known by: -

1\. A name that denotes what he is in himself ([Exo
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#014).md): I am that I am. This explains
his name Jehovah, and signifies, (1.) That he is self-existent; he has
his being of himself, and has no dependence upon any other: the greatest
and best man in the world must say, By the grace of God I am what I am;
but God says absolutely - and it is more than any creature, man or
angel, can say - I am that I am. Being self-existent, he cannot but be
self-sufficient, and therefore all-sufficient, and the inexhaustible
fountain of being and bliss. (2.) That he is eternal and unchangeable,
and always the same, yesterday, today, and for ever; he will be what he
will be and what he is; see [Rev 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#008.md).
(3.) That we cannot by searching find him out. This is such a name as
checks all bold and curious enquiries concerning God, and in effect
says, Ask not after my name, seeing it is secret, [Jdg
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#018.md); [Pro
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#004.md). Do we ask what is God? Let it
suffice us to know that he is what he is, what he ever was, and ever
will be. How little a portion is heard of him! [Job
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#014). (4..md) That he is faithful and
true to all his promises, unchangeable in his word as well as in his
nature, and not a man that he should lie. Let Israel know this, I AM
hath sent me unto you.

2\. A name that denotes what he is to his people. Lest that name I AM
should amuse and puzzle them, he is further directed to make use of
another name of God more familiar and intelligible: The Lord God of your
fathers hath sent me unto you ([Exo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#015).md): Thus God had made himself know
to him ([Exo 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#006).md), and thus he must
make him known to them, (1.) That he might revive among them the
religion of their fathers, which, it is to be feared, was much decayed
and almost lost. This was necessary to prepare them for deliverance,
[Psa 80:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#019). (2..md) That he might raise
their expectations of the speedy performance of the promises made unto
their fathers. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, are particularly named,
because with Abraham the covenant was first made, and with Isaac and
Jacob often expressly renewed; and these three were distinguished from
their brethren, and chosen to be the trustees of the covenant, when
their brethren were rejected. God will have this to be his name for
ever, and it has been, is, and will be, his name, by which his
worshippers know him, and distinguish him from all false gods; see [Kg1
18:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#036.md). Note, God's covenant-relation
to his people is what he will be ever mindful of, what he glories in,
and what he will have us never forget, but give him the glory of: if he
will have this to be his memorial unto all generations, we have all the
reason in the world to make it so with us, for it is a precious
memorial.

[Exodus 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 3:16</span></span>

Moses is here more particularly instructed in his work, and informed
beforehand of his success. 1. He must deal with the elders of Israel,
and raise their expectation of a speedy removal to Canaan, [Exo
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#016.md), [Exo
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#017.md). He must repeat to them what God
had said to him, as a faithful ambassador. Note, That which ministers
have received of the Lord they must deliver to his people, and keep back
nothing that is profitable. Lay an emphasis on that, [Exo
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#017.md) : "I have said, I will bring you
up; that is enough to satisfy them, I have said it:" hath he spoken, and
will he not make it good? With us saying and doing are two things, but
they are not so with God, for he is in one mind and who can turn him? "I
have said it, and all the world cannot gainsay it. My counsel shall
stand." His success with the elders of Israel would be good; so he is
told ([Exo 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#018).md): They shall hearken
to thy voice, and not thrust thee away as they did forty years ago. He
who, by his grace, inclines the heart, and opens the ear, could say
beforehand, They shall hearken to thy voice, having determined to make
them willing in this day of power. 2. He must deal with the king of
Egypt ([Exo 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#018).md), he and the elders
of Israel, and in this they must not begin with a demand, but with a
humble petition; that gentle and submissive method must be first tried,
even with one who, it was certain, would not be wrought upon by it: We
beseech thee, let us go. Moreover, they must only beg leave of Pharaoh
to go as far as Mount Sinai to worship God, and say nothing to him of
going quite away to Canaan; the latter would have been immediately
rejected, but the former was a very modest and reasonable request, and
his denying it was utterly inexcusable and justified them in the total
deserting of his kingdom. If he would not give them leave to go and
sacrifice at Sinai, justly did they go without leave to settle in
Canaan. Note, The calls and commands which God sends to sinners are so
highly reasonable in themselves, and delivered to them in such a gentle
winning way, that the mouth of the disobedient must needs be for ever
stopped. As to his success with Pharaoh, Moses is here told, (1.) That
petitions, and persuasions, and humble remonstrances, would not prevail
with him, no, nor a mighty hand stretched out in signs and wonders: I am
sure he will not let you go, [Exo
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#019.md). Note, God sends his messengers
to those whose hardness and obstinacy he certainly knows and foresees,
that it may appear he would have them turn and live. (2.) That plagues
should compel him to it: I will smite Egypt, and then he will let you
go, [Exo 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#020.md). Note, Those will
certainly be broken by the power of God's hand that will not bow to the
power of his word; we may be sure that when God judges he will overcome.
(3.) That his people should be more kind to them, and furnish them at
their departure with abundance of plate and jewels, to their great
enriching: I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians,
[Exo 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#021.md), [Exo
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#022.md). Note, \[1.\] God sometimes makes
the enemies of his people, not only to be at peace with them, but to be
kind to them. \[2.\] God has many ways of balancing accounts between the
injured and the injurious, of righting the oppressed, and compelling
those that have done wrong to make restitution; for he sits in the
throne judging right.
