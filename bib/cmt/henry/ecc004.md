### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ecc 4:0</span></span>

Solomon, having shown the vanity of this world in the temptation which
those in power feel to oppress and trample upon their subjects, here
further shows, I. The temptation which the oppressed feel to discontent
and impatience ([Ecc 4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001).md). II. The
temptation which those that love their case feel to take their case and
neglect business, for fear of being envied ([Ecc
4:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#004).md). III. The folly of hoarding up
abundance of worldly wealth ([Ecc 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#007.md),
[Ecc 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#008).md). IV. A remedy against that
folly, in being made sensible of the benefit of society and mutual
assistance ([Ecc 4:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#009).md). V. The
mutability even of royal dignity, not only through the folly of the
prince himself ([Ecc 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#013.md), [Ecc
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#014).md), but through the fickleness of
the people, let the prince be ever so discreet ([Ecc
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#015.md), [Ecc
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#016).md). It is not the prerogative even
of kings themselves to be exempted from the vanity and vexation that
attend these things; let none else then expect it.

[Ecclesiastes 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 4:1</span></span>

Solomon had a large soul ([Kg1 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#029).md)
and it appeared by this, among other things, that he had a very tender
concern for the miserable part of mankind and took cognizance of the
afflictions of the afflicted. He had taken the oppressors to task ([Ecc
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016.md), [Ecc
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#017).md) and put them in mind of the
judgment to come, to be a curb to their insolence; now here he observes
the oppressed. This he did, no doubt, as a prince, to do them justice
and avenge them of their adversaries, for he both feared God and
regarded men; but here he does it as a preacher, and shows,

I. The troubles of their condition ([Ecc
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001).md); of these he speaks very
feelingly and with compassion. It grieved him, 1. To see might
prevailing against right, to see so much oppression done under the sun,
to see servants, and labourers, and poor workmen, oppressed by their
masters, who take advantage of their necessity to impose what terms they
please upon them, debtors oppressed by cruel creditors and creditors too
by fraudulent debtors, tenants oppressed by hard landlords and orphans
by treacherous guardians, and, worst of all, subjects oppressed by
arbitrary princes and unjust judges. Such oppressions are done under the
sun; above the sun righteousness reigns for ever. Wise men will consider
these oppressions, and contrive to do something for the relief of those
that are oppressed. Blessed is he that considers the poor. 2. To see how
those that were wronged laid to heart the wrongs that were done them. He
beheld the tears of such as were oppressed, and perhaps could not
forbear weeping with them. The world is a place of weepers; look which
way we will, we have a melancholy scene presented to us, the tears of
those that are oppressed with one trouble or other. They find it is to
no purpose to complain, and therefore mourn in secret (as Job, [Job
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#020.md); [Job
30:28](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#028).md); but Blessed are those that
mourn. 3. To see how unable they were to help themselves: On the side of
their oppressors there was power, when they had done wrong, to stand to
it and make good what they had done, so that the poor were borne down
with a strong hand and had no way to obtain redress. It is sad to see
power misplaced, and that which was given men to enable them to do good
perverted to support them in doing wrong. 4. To see how they and their
calamities were slighted by all about them. They wept and needed
comfort, but there was none to do that friendly office: They had no
comforter; their oppressors were powerful and threatening, and therefore
they had no comforter; those that should have comforted them durst not,
for fear of displeasing the oppressors and being made their companions
for offering to be their comforters. It is sad to see so little humanity
among men.

II\. The temptations of their condition. Being thus hardly used, they
are tempted to hate and despise life, and to envy those that are dead
and in their graves, and to wish they had never been born ([Ecc
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#002.md), [Ecc
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#003).md); and Solomon is ready to agree
with them, for it serves to prove that all is vanity and vexation, since
life itself is often so; and if we disregard it, in comparison with the
favour and fruition of God (as St. Paul, [Act
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#024.md), [Phi
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023).md), it is our praise, but, if (as
here) only for the sake of the miseries that attend it, it is our
infirmity, and we judge therein after the flesh, as Job and Elijah did.
1. He here thinks those happy who have ended this miserable life, have
done their part and quitted the stage; "I praised the dead that are
already dead, slain outright, or that had a speedy passage through the
world, made a short cut over the ocean of life, dead already, before
they had well begun to live; I was pleased with their lot, and, had it
been in their own choice, should have praised their wisdom for but
looking into the world and then retiring, as not liking it. I concluded
that it is better with them than with the living that are yet alive and
that is all, dragging the long and heavy chain of life, and wearing out
its tedious minutes." This may be compared not with [Job
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#020.md), [Job
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#021.md), but with [Rev
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013.md), where, in times of persecution
(and such Solomon is here describing), it is not the passion of man, but
the Spirit of God, that says, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord
from henceforth. Note, The condition of the saints that are dead, and
gone to rest with God, is upon many accounts better and more desirable
than the condition of living saints that are yet continued in their work
and warfare. 2. He thinks those happy who never began this miserable
life; nay, they are happiest of all: He that has not been is happier
than both they. Better never to have been born than be born to see the
evil work that is done under the sun, to see so much wickedness
committed, so much wrong done, and not only to be in no capacity to mend
the matter, but to suffer ill for doing well. A good man, how calamitous
a condition soever he is in in this world, cannot have cause to wish he
had never been born, since he is glorifying the Lord even in the fires,
and will be happy at last, for ever happy. Nor ought any to wish so
while they are alive, for while there is life there is hope; a man is
never undone till he is in hell.

[Ecclesiastes 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 4:4</span></span>

Here Solomon returns to the observation and consideration of the vanity
and vexation of spirit that attend the business of this world, which he
had spoken of before, [Ecc 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#011.md).

I. If a man be acute, and dexterous, and successful in his business, he
gets the ill-will of his neighbours, [Ecc
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#004.md). Though he takes a great deal of
pains, and goes through all travail, does not get his estate easily, but
it costs him a great deal of hard labour, nor does he get it
dishonestly, he wrongs no man, defrauds no man, but by every right work,
by applying himself to his own proper business, and managing it by all
the rules of equity and fair dealing, yet for this he is envied of his
neighbour, and the more for the reputation he has got by his honesty.
This shows, 1. What little conscience most men have, that they will bear
a grudge to a neighbour, give him an ill word and do him an ill turn,
only because he is more ingenious and industrious than themselves, and
has more of the blessing of heaven. Cain envied Abel, Esau Jacob, and
Saul David, and all for their right works. This is downright diabolism.
2. What little comfort wise and useful men must expect to have in this
world. Let them behave themselves ever so cautiously, they cannot escape
being envied; and who can stand before envy? [Pro
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#004.md). Those that excel in virtue will
always be an eye-sore to those that exceed in vice, which should not
discourage us from any right work, but drive us to expect the praise of
it, not from men, but from God, and not to count upon satisfaction and
happiness in the creature; for, if right works prove vanity and vexation
of spirit, no works under the sun can prove otherwise. But for every
right work a man shall be accepted of his God, and then he needs not
mind though he be envied of his neighbour, only it may make him love the
world the less.

II\. If a man be stupid, and dull, and blundering in his business, he
does ill for himself ([Ecc 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#005).md): The
fool that goes about his work as if his hands were muffled and folded
together, that does every thing awkwardly, the sluggard (for he is a
fool) that loves his ease and folds his hands together to keep them
warm, because they refuse to labour, he eats his own flesh, is a
cannibal to himself, brings himself into such a poor condition that he
has nothing to eat but his own flesh, into such a desperate condition
that he is ready to eat his own flesh for vexation. He has a dog's life
- hunger and ease. Because he sees active men that thrive in the world
envied, he runs into the other extreme; and, lest he should be envied
for his right works, he does every thing wrong, and does not deserve to
be pitied. Note, Idleness is a sin that is its own punishment. The
following words ([Ecc 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#006).md), Better is
a handful with quietness than both the hands full with travail and
vexation of spirit, may be taken either, 1. As the sluggard's argument
for the excuse of himself in his idleness. He folds his hands together,
and abuses and misapplies a good truth for his justification, as if,
because a little with quietness is better than abundance with strife,
therefore a little with idleness is better than abundance with honest
labour: thus wise in his own conceit is he, [Pro
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#016.md). But, 2. I rather take it as
Solomon's advice to keep the mean between that travail which will make a
man envied and that slothfulness which will make a man eat his own
flesh. Let us by honest industry lay hold on the handful, that we may
not want necessaries, but not grasp at both the hands full, which will
but create us vexation of spirit. Moderate pains and moderate gains will
do best. A man may have but a handful of the world, and yet may enjoy it
and himself with a great deal of quietness, with content of mind, peace
of conscience, and the love and good-will of his neighbours, while many
that have both their hands full, have more than heart could wish, have a
great deal of travail and vexation with it. Those that cannot live on a
little, it is to be feared, would not live as they should if they had
ever so much.

[Ecclesiastes 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 4:7</span></span>

Here Solomon fastens upon another instance of the vanity of this world,
that frequently the more men have of it the more they would have; and on
this they are so intent that they have no enjoyment of what they have.
Now Solomon here shows,

I. That selfishness is the cause of this evil ([Ecc
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#007.md), [Ecc
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#008).md): There is one alone, that minds
none but himself, cares for nobody, but would, if he could, be placed
alone in the midst of the earth; there is not a second, nor does he
desire there should be: one mouth he thinks enough in a house, and
grudges every thing that goes beside him. See how this covetous muckworm
is here described. 1. He makes himself a mere slave to his business.
Though he has no charge, neither child nor brother, none to take care of
but himself, none to hang upon him, or draw from him, no poor relations,
nor dares he marry, for fear of the expense of a family, yet is there no
end of his labour; he is at it night and day, early and late, and will
scarcely allow necessary rest to himself and those he employs. He does
not confine himself within the bounds of his own calling, but is for
having a hand in any thing that he can get by. See [Psa
127:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#002.md). 2. He never thinks he has
enough: His eye is not satisfied with riches. Covetousness is called the
lust of the eye ([Jo1 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#016).md) because
the beholding of it with his eyes is all that the worldling seems to
covet, [Ecc 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#011.md). He has enough for
his back (as bishop Reynolds observes), for his belly, for his calling,
for his family, for his living decently in the world, but he has not
enough for his eyes. Though he can but see it, can but count his money,
and not find in his heart to use it, yet he is not easy because he has
not more to regale his eyes with. 3. He denies himself the comfort of
what he has: he bereaves his soul of good. If our souls are bereaved of
good, it is we ourselves that do bereave them. Others may bereave us of
outward good, but cannot rob us of our graces and comforts, our
spiritual good things. It is our own fault if we do not enjoy ourselves.
Yet many are so set upon the world that, in pursuit of it, they bereave
their souls of good here and for ever, make shipwreck of faith and of a
good conscience, bereave themselves not only of the favour of God and
eternal life, but of the pleasures of this world too and this present
life. Worldly people, pretending to be wise for themselves, are really
enemies to themselves. 4. He has no excuse for doing this: He has
neither child nor brother, none that he is bound to, on whom he may lay
out what he has to his satisfaction while he lives, none that he has a
kindness for, for whom he may lay it up to his satisfaction and to whom
he may leave it when he dies, none that are poor or dear to him. 5. He
has not consideration enough to show himself the folly of this. He never
puts this question to himself, "For whom do I labour thus? Do I labour,
as I should, for the glory of God, and that I may have to give to those
that need? Do I consider that it is but for the body that I am
labouring, a dying body; it is for others, and I know not for whom -
perhaps for a fool, that will scatter it as fast as I have gathered it -
perhaps for a foe, that will be ungrateful to my memory?" Note, It is
wisdom for those that take pains about this world to consider whom they
take all this pains for, and whether it be really worth while to bereave
themselves of good that they may bestow it on a stranger. If men do not
consider this, it is vanity, and a sore travail; they shame and vex
themselves to no purpose.

II\. That sociableness is the cure of this evil. Men are thus sordid
because they are all for themselves. Now Solomon shows here, by divers
instances, that it is not good for man to be alone ([Gen
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#018).md); he designs hereby to recommend
to us both marriage and friendship, two things which covetous misers
decline, because of the charge of them; but such are the comfort and
advantage of them both, if prudently contracted, that they will very
well quit cost. Man, in paradise itself, could not be happy without a
mate, and therefore is no sooner made than matched. 1. Solomon lays this
down for a truth, That two are better than one, and more happy jointly
than either of them could be separately, more pleased in one another
than they could be in themselves only, mutually serviceable to each
other's welfare, and by a united strength more likely to do good to
others: They have a good reward of their labour; whatever service they
do, it is returned to them another way. He that serves himself only has
himself only for his paymaster, and commonly proves more unjust and
ungrateful to himself than his friend, if he should serve him, would be
to him; witness him that labours endlessly and yet bereaves his soul of
good; he has no reward of his labour. But he that is kind to another has
a good reward; the pleasure and advantage of holy love will be an
abundant recompence for all the work and labour of love. Hence Solomon
infers the mischief of solitude: Woe to him that is alone. He lies
exposed to many temptations which good company and friendship would
prevent and help him to guard against; he wants that advantage which a
man has by the countenance of his friend, as iron has of being sharpened
by iron. A monastic life then was surely never intended for a state of
perfection, nor should those be reckoned the greatest lovers of God who
cannot find in their hearts to love any one else. 2. He proves it by
divers instances of the benefit of friendship and good conversation.
(1.) Occasional succour in an exigency. It is good for two to travel
together, for if one happen to fall, he may be lost for want of a little
help. If a man fall into sin, his friend will help to restore him with
the spirit of meekness; if he fall into trouble, his friend will help to
comfort him and assuage his grief. (2.) Mutual warmth. As a
fellow-traveller is of use (amicus pro vehiculo - a friend is a good
substitute for a carriage) so is a bedfellow: If two lie together, they
have heat. So virtuous and gracious affections are excited by good
society, and Christians warm one another by provoking one another to
love and to good works. (3.) United strength. If an enemy find a man
alone, he is likely to prevail against him; with his own single strength
he cannot make his part good, but, if he have a second, he may do well
enough: two shall withstand him. "You shall help me against my enemy,
and I will help you against yours;" according to the agreement between
Joab and Abishai ([Sa2 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#011).md), and so
both are conquerors; whereas, acting separately, both would have been
conquered; as was said of the ancient Britons, when the Romans invaded
them, Dum singuli pugnant, universi vincuntur - While they fight in
detached parties, they sacrifice the general cause. In our spiritual
warfare we may be helpful to one another as well as in our spiritual
work; next to the comfort of communion with God, is that of the
communion of saints. He concludes with this proverb, A threefold cord is
not easily broken, any more than a bundle of arrows, though each single
thread, and each single arrow, is. Two together he compares to a
threefold cord; for where two are closely joined in holy love and
fellowship, Christ will by his Spirit come to them, and make the third,
as he joined himself to the two disciples going to Emmaus, and then
there is a threefold cord that can never be broken. They that dwell in
love, dwell in God, and God in them.

[Ecclesiastes 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 4:13</span></span>

Solomon was himself a king, and therefore may be allowed to speak more
freely than another concerning the vanity of kingly state and dignity,
which he shows here to be an uncertain thing; he had before said so
([Pro 27:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#024.md), The crown doth not endure
to every generation), and his son found it so. Nothing is more slippery
than the highest post of honour without wisdom and the people's love.

I. A king is not happy unless he have wisdom, [Ecc
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#013.md), [Ecc
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#014.md). He that is truly wise, prudent,
and pious, though he be poor in the world, and very young, and upon both
accounts despised and little taken notice of, is better, more truly
valuable and worthy of respect, is likely to do better for himself and
to be a greater blessing to his generation, than a king, than an old
king, and therefore venerable both for his gravity and for his dignity,
if he be foolish, and knows not how to manage public affairs himself nor
will be admonished and advised by others - who knows not to be
admonished, that is, will not suffer any counsel or admonition to be
given him (no one about him dares contradict him) or will not hearken to
the counsel and admonition that are given him. It is so far from being
any part of the honour of kings that it is the greatest dishonour to
them that can be not to be admonished. Folly and wilfulness commonly go
together, and those that most need admonition can worst bear it; but
neither age nor titles will secure men respect if they have not true
wisdom and virtue to recommend them; while wisdom and virtue will gain
men honour even under the disadvantages of youth and poverty. To prove
the wise child better than the foolish king he shows what each of them
comes to, [Ecc 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#014.md). 1. A poor man by
his wisdom comes to be preferred, as Joseph, who, when he was but young,
was brought out of prison to be the second man in the kingdom, to which
story Solomon seems here to refer. Providence sometimes raises the poor
out of the dust, to set them among princes, [Psa
113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007.md), [Psa
113:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#008.md). Wisdom has wrought not only the
liberty of men, but their dignity, raised them from the dunghill, from
the dungeon, to the throne. 2. A king by his folly and wilfulness comes
to be impoverished. Though he was born in his kingdom, came to it by
inheritance, though he has lived to be old in it and has had time to
fill his treasures, yet if he take ill courses, and will no more be
admonished as he has been, thinking, because he is old, he is past it,
he becomes poor; his treasure is exhausted, and perhaps he is forced to
resign his crown and retire into privacy.

II\. A king is not likely to continue if he have not a confirmed
interest in the affections of the people; this is intimated, but
somewhat obscurely, in the last two verses. 1. He that is king must have
a successor, a second, a child that shall stand up in his stead, his
own, suppose, or perhaps that poor and wise child spoken of, [Ecc
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#013.md). Kings, when they grow old, must
have the mortification of seeing those that are to jostle them out and
stand up in their stead. 2. It is common with the people to adore the
rising sun: All the living who walk under the sun are with the second
child, are in his interests, are conversant with him, and make their
court to him more than to the father, whom they look upon as going off,
and despise because his best days are past. Solomon considered this; he
saw this to be the disposition of his own people, which appeared
immediately after his death, in their complaints of his government and
their affectation of a change. 3. People are never long easy and
satisfied: There is no end, no rest, of all the people; they are
continually fond of changes, and know not what they would have. 4. This
is no new thing, but it has been the way of all that have been before
them; there have been instances of this in every age: even Samuel and
David could not always please. 5. As it has been, so it is likely to be
still: Those that come after will be of the same spirit, and shall not
long rejoice in him whom at first they seemed extremely fond of. Today,
Hosanna - tomorrow, Crucify. 6. It cannot but be a great grief to
princes to see themselves thus slighted by those they have studied to
oblige and have depended upon; there is no faith in man, no
stedfastness. This is vanity and vexation of spirit.
