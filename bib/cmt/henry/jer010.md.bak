### [Jeremiah Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 10:0</span></span>

We may conjecture that the prophecy of this chapter was delivered after
the first captivity, in the time of Jeconiah or Jehoiachin, when many
were carried away to Babylon; for it has a double reference: - I. To
those that were carried away into the land of the Chaldeans, a country
notorious above any other for idolatry and superstition; and they are
here cautioned against the infection of the place, not to learn the way
of the heathen ([Jer 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#001.md), [Jer
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#002).md), for their astrology and
idolatry are both foolish things ([Jer
10:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#003).md), and the worshippers of idols
brutish ([Jer 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#008.md), [Jer
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#009).md). So it will appear in the day of
their visitation ([Jer 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#014.md), [Jer
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#015).md). They are likewise exhorted to
adhere firmly to the God of Israel, for there is none like him ([Jer
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#006.md), [Jer
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#007).md). He is the true God, lives for
ever, and has the government of the world ([Jer
10:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#010).md), and his people are happy in
him ([Jer 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#016).md). II. To those that
yet remained in their own land. They are cautioned against security, and
told to expect distress ([Jer 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#017.md),
[Jer 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#018).md) and that by a foreign
enemy, which God would bring upon them for their sin ([Jer
10:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#020).md). This calamity the prophet
laments ([Jer 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#019).md) and prays for the
mitigation of it ([Jer 10:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#023).md).

[Jeremiah 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 10:1</span></span>

The prophet Isaiah, when he prophesied of the captivity in Babylon,
added warnings against idolatry and largely exposed the sottishness of
idolaters, not only because the temptations in Babylon would be in
danger of drawing the Jews there to idolatry, but because the
afflictions in Babylon were designed to cure them of their idolatry.
Thus the prophet Jeremiah here arms people against the idolatrous usages
and customs of the heathen, not only for the use of those that had gone
to Babylon, but of those also that staid behind, that being convinced
and reclaimed, by the word of God, the rod might be prevented; and it is
written for our learning. Observe here,

I. A solemn charge given to the people of God not to conform themselves
to the ways and customs of the heathen. Let the house of Israel hear and
receive this word from the God of Israel: "Learn not the way of the
heathen, do not approve of it, no, nor think indifferently concerning
it, much less imitate it or accustom yourselves to it. Let not any of
their customs steal in among you (as they are apt to do insensibly) nor
mingle themselves with your religion." Note, It ill becomes those that
are taught of God to learn the way of the heathen, and to think of
worshipping the true God with such rites and ceremonies as they used in
the worship of their false gods. See [Deu
12:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#029.md). It was the way of the
heathen to worship the host of heaven, the sun, moon, and stars; to them
they gave divine honours, and from them they expected divine favours,
and therefore, according as the signs of heaven were, whether they were
auspicious or ominous, they thought themselves countenanced or
discountenanced by their deities, which made them observe those signs,
the eclipses of the sun and moon, the conjunctions and oppositions of
the planets, and all the unusual phenomena of the celestial globe, with
a great deal of anxiety and trembling. Business was stopped if any thing
occurred that was thought to bode ill; if it did but thunder on their
left hand, they were almost as if they had been thunderstruck. Now God
would not have his people to be dismayed at the signs of heaven, to
reverence the stars as deities, nor to frighten themselves with any
prognostications grounded upon them. Let them fear the God of heaven,
and keep up a reverence of his providence, and then they need not be
dismayed at the signs of heaven, for the stars in their courses fight
not against any that are at peace with God. The heathen are dismayed at
these signs, for they know no better; but let not the house of Israel,
that are taught of God, be so.

II\. Divers good reasons given to enforce this charge.

1\. The way of the heathen is very ridiculous and absurd, and is
condemned even by the dictates of right reason, [Jer
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#003.md). The statutes and ordinances of
the heathen are vanity itself; they cannot stand the test of a rational
disquisition. This is again and again insisted upon here, as it was by
Isaiah. The Chaldeans valued themselves upon their wisdom, in which they
thought that they excelled all their neighbours; but the prophet here
shows that they, and all others that worshipped idols and expected help
and relief from them, were brutish and sottish, and had not common
sense. (1.) Consider what the idol is that is worshipped. It was a tree
cut out of the forest originally. It was fitted up by the hands of the
workman, squared, and sawed, and worked into shape; see [Isa
44:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#012.md), etc. But, after all, it was but
the stock of a tree, fitter to make a gate-post of than any thing else.
But, to hide the wood, they deck it with silver and gold, they gild or
lacquer it, or they deck it with gold and silver lace, or cloth of
tissue. They fasten it to its place, which they themselves have assigned
it, with nails and hammers, that it fall not, nor be thrown down, nor
stolen away, [Jer 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#004.md). The image is
made straight enough, and it cannot be denied but that the workman did
his part, for it is upright as the palm-tree ([Jer
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#005).md); it looks stately, and stands up
as if it were going to speak to you, but it cannot speak; it is a poor
dumb creature; nor can it take one step towards your relief. If there be
any occasion for it to shift its place, it must be carried in
procession, for it cannot go. Very fitly does the admonition come in
here, "Be not afraid of them, any more than of the signs of heaven; be
not afraid of incurring their displeasure, for they can do no evil; be
not afraid of forfeiting their favour, for neither is it in them to do
good. If you think to mend the matter by mending the materials of which
the idol is made, you deceive yourselves. Idols of gold and silver are
an unworthy to be worshipped as wooden gods. The stock is a doctrine of
vanities, [Jer 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#008.md). It teaches lies,
teaches lies concerning God. It is an instruction of vanities; it is
wood." It is probable that the idols of gold and silver had wood
underneath for the substratum, and then silver spread into plates is
brought from Tarshish, imported from beyond sea, and gold from Uphaz, or
Phaz, which is sometimes rendered the fine or pure gold, [Psa
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003.md). A great deal of art is used, and
pains taken, about it. They are not such ordinary mechanics that are
employed about these as about the wooden gods, [Jer
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#003.md). these are cunning men; it is the
work of the workman; the graver must do his part when it has passed
through the hands of the founder. Those were but decked here and there
with silver and gold; these are silver and gold all over. And, that
these gods might be reverenced as kings, blue and purple are their
clothing, the colour of royal robes ([Jer
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#009).md), which amuses ignorant
worshippers, but makes the matter no better. For what is the idol when
it is made and when they have made the best they can of it? He tells us
([Jer 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#014).md): They are falsehood; they
are not what they pretend to be, but a great cheat put upon the world.
They are worshipped as the gods that give us breath and life and sense,
whereas they are lifeless senseless things themselves, and there is no
breath in them; there is no spirit in them (so the word is); they are
not animated, or inhabited, as they are supposed to be, by any divine
spirit or numen - divinity. They are so far from being gods that they
have not so much as the spirit of a beast that goes downward. They are
vanity, and the work of errors, [Jer
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#015.md). Enquire into the use of them
and you will find they are vanity; they are good for nothing; no help is
to be expected from them nor any confidence put in them. They are a
deceitful work, works of illusions, or mere mockeries; so some read the
following clause. They delude those that put their trust in them, make
fools of them, or, rather, they make fools of themselves. Enquire into
the use of them and you will find they are the work of errors, grounded
upon the grossest mistakes that ever men who pretended to reason were
guilty of. They are the creatures of a deluded fancy; and the errors by
which they were produced they propagate among their worshippers. (2.)
Infer hence what the idolaters are that worship these idols. ([Jer
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#008).md): They are altogether brutish and
foolish. Those that make them are like unto them, senseless and stupid,
and there is no spirit in them - no use of reason, else they would never
stoop to them, [Jer 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#014.md). Every man
that makes or worships idols has become brutish in his knowledge, that
is, brutish for want of knowledge, or brutish in that very thing which
one would think they should be fully acquainted with; compare [Jde
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#010.md), What they know naturally, what
they cannot but know by the light of nature, in those things as brute
beasts they corrupt themselves. Though in the works of creation they
cannot but see the eternal power and godhead of the Creator, yet they
have become vain in their imaginations, not liking to retain God in
their knowledge. See [Rom 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021.md), [Rom
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018.md). Nay, whereas they thought it a
piece of wisdom thus to multiply gods, it really was the greatest folly
they could be guilty of. The world by wisdom knew not God, [Co1
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021.md); [Rom
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#022.md). Every founder is himself
confounded by the graven image; when he has made it by a mistake he is
more and more confirmed in his mistake by it; he is bewildered,
bewitched, and cannot disentangle himself from the snare; or it is what
he will one time or other be ashamed of.

2\. The God of Israel is the one only living and true God, and those
that have him for their God need not make their application to any
other; nay, to set up any other in competition with him is the greatest
affront and injury that can be done him. Let the house of Israel cleave
to the God of Israel and serve and worship him only, for,

(1.) He is a non-such. Whatever men may set in competition with him,
there is none to be compared with him. The prophet turns from speaking
with the utmost disdain of the idols of the heathen (as well he might)
to speak with the most profound and awful reverence of the God of Israel
([Jer 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#006.md), [Jer
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#007).md): "Forasmuch as there is none
like unto thee, O Lord! none of all the heroes which the heathen have
deified and make such ado about," the dead men of whom they made dead
images, and whom they worshipped. "Some were deified and adored for
their wisdom; but, among all the wise men of the nations, the greatest
philosophers or statesmen, as Apollo or Hermes, there is none like thee.
Others were deified and adored for their dominion; but, in all their
royalty" (so it may be read), "among all their kings, as Saturn and
Jupiter, there is none like unto thee." What is the glory of a man that
invented a useful art or founded a flourishing kingdom (and these were
grounds sufficient among the heathen to entitle a man to an apotheosis)
compared with the glory of him that is the Creator of the world and that
forms the spirit of man within him? What is the glory of the greatest
prince or potentate, compared with the glory of him whose kingdom rules
over all? He acknowledges ([Jer 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#006).md),
O Lord! thou art great, infinite and immense, and thy name is great in
might; thou hast all power, and art known to have it. Men's name is
often beyond their might; they are thought to be greater than they are;
but God's name is great, and no greater than he really is. And therefore
who would not fear thee, O King of nations? Who would not choose to
worship such a God as this, that can do every thing, rather than such
dead idols as the heathen worship, that can do nothing? Who would not be
afraid of offending or forsaking a God whose name is so great in might?
Which of all the nations, if they understood their interests aright,
would not fear him who is the King of nations? Note, There is an
admirable decency and congruity in the worshipping of God only. It is
fit that he who is God alone should alone be served, that he who is Lord
of all should be served by all, that he who is great should be greatly
feared and greatly praised.

(2.) His verity is as evident as the idol's vanity, [Jer
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#010.md). They are the work of men's
hands, and therefore nothing is more plain than that it is a jest to
worship them, if that may be called a jest which is so great an
indignity to him that made us: But the Lord is the true God, the God of
truth; he is God in truth. God Jehovah is truth; he is not a counterfeit
and pretender, as they are, but is really what he has revealed himself
to be; he is one we may depend upon, in whom and by whom we cannot be
deceived. \[1.\] Look upon him as he is in himself, and he is the living
God. He is life itself, has life in himself, and is the fountain of life
to all the creatures. The gods of the heathen are dead things, worthless
and useless, but ours is a living God, and hath immortality. \[2.\] Look
upon him with relation to his creatures, he is a King, and absolute
monarch, over them all, is their owner and ruler, has an incontestable
right both to command them and dispose of them. As a king, he protects
the creatures, provides for their welfare, and preserves peace among
them. He is an everlasting king. The counsels of his kingdom were from
everlasting and the continuance of it will be to everlasting. He is a
King of eternity. The idols whom they call their kings are but of
yesterday, and will soon be abolished; and the kings of the earth, that
set them up to be worshipped, will themselves be in the dust shortly;
but the Lord shall reign for ever, thy God, O Zion! unto all
generations.

(3.) None knows the power of his anger. Let us stand in awe, and not
dare to provoke him by giving that glory to another which is due to him
alone; for at his wrath the earth shall tremble, even the strongest and
stoutest of the kings of the earth; nay, the earth, firmly as it is
fixed, when he pleases is made to quake and the rocks to tremble, [Psa
104:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#032.md); [Hab
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#006.md), [Hab
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#010.md). Though the nations should join
together to contend with him, and unite their force, yet they would be
found utterly unable not only to resist, but even to abide his
indignation. Not only can they not make head against it, for it would
overcome them, but they cannot bear up under it, for it would overload
them, [Psa 76:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#007.md), [Psa
76:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#008.md); [Nah
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#006.md).

(4.) He is the God of nature, the fountain of all being; and all the
powers of nature are at his command and disposal, [Jer
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#012.md), [Jer
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#013.md). The God we worship is he that
made the heavens and the earth, and has a sovereign dominion over both;
so that his invisible things are manifested and proved in the things
that are seen. \[1.\] If we look back, we find that the whole world owed
its origin to him as its first cause. It was a common saying even among
the Greeks - He that sets up to be another god ought first to make
another world. While the heathen worship gods that they made, we worship
the God that made us and all things. First, The earth is a body of vast
bulk, has valuable treasures in its bowels and more valuable fruit on
its surface. It and them he has made by his power; and it is by no less
than an infinite power that it hangs upon nothing, as it does ([Job
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#007).md) - ponderibus librata suis -
poised by its own weight. Secondly, The world, the habitable part of the
earth, is admirably fitted for the use and service of man, and he hath
established it so by his wisdom, so that it continues serviceable in
constant changes and yet a continual stability from one generation to
another. Therefore both the earth and the world are his, [Psa
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md). Thirdly, The heavens are
wonderfully stretched out to an incredible extent, and it is by his
discretion that they are so, and that the motions of the heavenly bodies
are directed for the benefit of this lower world. These declare his
glory ([Psa 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001).md), and oblige us to
declare it, and not give that glory to the heavens which is due to him
that made them. \[2.\] If we look up, we see his providence to be a
continued creation ([Jer 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#013).md): When
he uttereth his voice (gives the word of command) there is a multitude
of waters in the heavens, which are poured out on the earth, whether for
judgment or mercy, as he intends them. When he utters his voice in the
thunder, immediately there follow thunder-showers, in which there are a
multitude of waters; and those come with a noise, as the margin reads
it; and we read of the noise of abundance of rain, [Kg1
18:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#041.md). Nay, there are wonders done
daily in the kingdom of nature without noise: He causes the vapours to
ascend from the ends of the earth, from all parts of the earth, even the
most remote, and chiefly those that lie next the sea. All the earth pays
the tribute of vapours, because all the earth receives the blessing of
rain. And thus the moisture in the universe, like the money in a kingdom
and the blood in the body, is continually circulating for the good of
the whole. Those vapours produce wonders, for of them are formed
lightnings for the rain, and the winds which God from time to time
brings forth out of his treasures, as there is occasion for them,
directing them all in such measure and for such use as he thinks fit, as
payments are made out of the treasury. All the meteors are so ready to
serve God's purposes that he seems to have treasures of them, that
cannot be exhausted and may at any time be drawn from, [Psa
135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007.md). God glories in the treasures he
has of these, [Job 38:22](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#022.md), [Job
38:23](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#023.md). This God can do; but which of
the idols of the heathen can do the like? Note, There is no sort of
weather but what furnishes us with a proof and instance of the wisdom
and power of the great Creator.

(5.) This God is Israel's God in covenant, and the felicity of every
Israelite indeed. Therefore let the house of Israel cleave to him, and
not forsake him to embrace idols; for, if they do, they certainly change
for the worse, for ([Jer 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#016).md) the
portion of Jacob is not like them; their rock is not as our rock ([Deu
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#031).md), nor ours like their
mole-hills. Note, \[1.\] Those that have the Lord for their God have a
full and complete happiness in him. The God of Jacob is the portion of
Jacob; he is his all, and in him he has enough and needs no more in this
world nor the other. In him we have a worthy portion, [Psa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005.md). \[2.\] If we have entire
satisfaction and complacency in God as our portion, he will have a
gracious delight in us as his people, whom he owns as the rod of his
inheritance, his possession and treasure, with whom he dwells and by
whom he is served and honoured. \[3.\] It is the unspeakable comfort of
all the Lord's people that he who is their God is the former of all
things, and therefore is able to do all that for them, and give all that
to them, which they stand in need of. Their help stands in his name who
made heaven and earth. And he is the Lord of hosts, of all the hosts in
heaven and earth, has them all at his command, and will command them
into the service of his people when there is occasion. This is the name
by which they know him, which they first give him the glory of and then
take to themselves the comfort of. \[4.\] Herein God's people are happy
above all other people, happy indeed, bona si sua norint - did they but
know their blessedness. The gods which the heathen pride, and please,
and so portion themselves in, are vanity and a lie; but the portion of
Jacob is not like them.

3\. The prophet, having thus compared the gods of the heathen with the
God of Israel (between whom there is no comparison), reads the doom, the
certain doom, of all those pretenders, and directs the Jews, in God's
name, to read it to the worshippers of idols, though they were their
lords and masters ([Jer 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#011).md): Thus
shall you say unto them (and the God you serve will bear you out in
saying it), The gods which have not made the heavens and the earth (and
therefore are no gods, but usurpers of the honour due to him only who
did make heaven and earth) shall perish, perish of course, because they
are vanity - perish by his righteous sentence, because they are rivals
with him. As gods they shall perish from off the earth (even all those
things on earth beneath which they make gods of) and from under these
heavens, even all those things in the firmament of heaven, under the
highest heavens, which are deified, according to the distribution in the
second commandment. These words in the original are not in the Hebrew,
like all the rest, but in the Chaldee dialect, that the Jews in
captivity might have this ready to say to the Chaldeans in their own
language when they tempted them to idolatry: "Do you press us to worship
your gods? We will never do that; for," (1.) "They are counterfeit
deities; they are no gods, for they have not made the heavens and the
earth, and therefore are not entitled to our homage, nor are we indebted
to them either for the products of the earth or the influences of
heaven, as we are to the God of Israel." The primitive Christians would
say, when they were urged to worship such a god, Let him make a world
and he shall be my god. While we have him to worship who made heaven and
earth, it is very absurd to worship any other. (2.) "They are condemned
deities. They shall perish; the time shall come when they shall be no
more respected as they are now, but shall be buried in oblivion, and
they and their worshippers shall sink together. The earth shall no
longer bear them; the heavens shall no longer cover them; but both shall
abandon them." It is repeated ([Jer
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#015).md), In the time of their
visitation they shall perish. When God comes to reckon with idolaters he
will make them weary of their idols, and glad to be rid of them. They
shall cast them to the moles and to the bats, [Isa
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#020.md). Whatever runs against God and
religion will be run down at last.

[Jeremiah 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 10:17</span></span>

In these verses,

I. The prophet threatens, in God's name, the approaching ruin of Judah
and Jerusalem, [Jer 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#017.md), [Jer
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#018.md). The Jews that continued in
their own land, after some were carried into captivity, were very
secure; they thought themselves inhabitants of a fortress; their country
was their strong hold, and, in their own conceit, impregnable; but they
are here told to think of leaving it: they must prepare to go after
their brethren, and pack up their effects in expectation of it: "Gather
up thy wares out of the land; contract your affairs, and bring them into
as small a compass as you can. Arise, depart, this is not your rest,"
[Mic 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010.md). Let not what you have lie
scattered, for the Chaldeans will be upon you again, to be the
executioners of the sentence God has passed upon you ([Jer
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#018).md): "Behold, I will sling out the
inhabitants of the land at this once; they have hitherto dropped out, by
a few at a time, but one captivity more shall make a thorough riddance,
and they shall be slung out as a stone out of a sling, so easily, so
thoroughly shall they be cast out; nothing of them shall remain. they
shall be thrown out with violence, and driven to a place at a great
distance off, in a little time." See this comparison used to signify an
utter destruction, [Sa1 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#029.md). Yet
once more God will shake their land, and shake the wicked out of it,
[Heb 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026.md). He adds, And I will
distress them, that they may find it so. He will not only throw them out
hence (that he may do and yet they may be easy elsewhere); but,
whithersoever they go, trouble shall follow them; they shall be
continually perplexed and straitened, and at a loss within themselves:
and who or what can make those easy whom God will distress, whom he will
distress that they may find it so, that they may feel that which they
would not believe? They were often told of the weight of God's wrath and
their utter inability to make head against it, or bear up under it. They
were told that their sin would be their ruin, and they would not regard
nor credit what was told them; but now they shall find it so; and
therefore God will pursue them with his judgments, that they may find it
so, and be forced to acknowledge it. Note, sooner or later sinners will
find it just as the word of God has represented things to them, and no
better, and that the threatenings were not bugbears.

II\. He brings in the people sadly lamenting their calamities ([Jer
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#019).md): Woe is me for my hurt! Some
make this the prophet's own lamentation, not for himself, but for the
calamities and desolations of his country. He mourned for those that
would not be persuaded to mourn for themselves; and, since there were
none that had so much sense as to join with them, he weeps in secret,
and cries out, Woe is me! In mournful times it becomes us to be of a
mournful spirit. But it may be taken as the language of the people,
considered as a body, and therefore speaking as a single person. The
prophet puts into their mouths the words they should say; whether they
would say them or no, they should have cause to say them. Some among
them would thus bemoan themselves, and all of them, at last, would be
forced to do it. 1. They lament that the affliction is very great, and
it is very hard to them to bear it, the more hard because they had not
been used to trouble and now did not expect it: "Woe is me for my hurt,
not for what I fear, but for what I feel;" for they are not, as some
are, worse frightened than hurt. Nor is it a slight hurt, but a wound, a
wound that is grievous, very painful, and very threatening. 2. That
there is no remedy but patience. They cannot help themselves, but must
sit still, and abide it: But I said, when I was about to complain of my
wound, To what purpose is it to complain? This is a grief, and I must
bear it as well as I can. This is the language rather of a sullen than
of a gracious submission, of a patience per force, not a patience by
principle. When I am in affliction I should say, "This is an evil, and I
will bear it, because it is the will of God that I should, because his
wisdom has appointed this for me and his grace will make it work for
good to me." This is receiving evil at the hand of God, [Job
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#010.md). But to say, "This is an evil,
and I must bear it, because I cannot help it," is but a brutal patience,
and argues a want of those good thoughts of God which we should always
have, even under our afflictions, saying, not only, God can and will do
what he pleases, but, Let him do what he pleases. 3. That the country
was quite ruined and wasted ([Jer
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#020).md): My tabernacle is spoiled.
Jerusalem, though a strong city, now proves as weak and moveable as a
tabernacle or tent, when it is taken down, and all its cords, that
should keep it together, are broken. Or by the tabernacle here may be
meant the temple, the sanctuary, which at first was but a tabernacle,
and is now called so, as then it was sometimes called a temple. Their
church is ruined, and all the supports of it fail. It was a general
destruction of church and state, city and country, and there were none
to repair these desolations. "My children have gone forth of me; some
have fled, others are slain, others carried into captivity, so that as
to me, they are not; I am likely to be an outcast, and to perish for
want of shelter; for there is none to stretch forth my tent any more,
none of my children that used to do it for me, none to set up my
curtains, none to do me any service." Jerusalem has none to guide her of
all her sons, [Isa 51:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#018.md). 4. That the
rulers took no care, nor any proper measures, for the redress of their
grievances and the re-establishing of heir ruined state ([Jer
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#021).md): The pastors have become
brutish. When the tents, the shepherds' tents, were spoiled ([Jer
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#020).md), it concerned the shepherds to
look after them; but they were foolish shepherds. Their kings and
princes had no regard at all for the public welfare, seemed to have no
sense of the desolations of the land, but were quite besotted and
infatuated. The priests, the pastors of God's tabernacle, did a great
deal towards the ruin of religion, but nothing towards the repair of it.
They are brutish indeed, for they have not sought the Lord; they have
neither made their peace with him nor their prayer to him; they had no
eye to him and his providence, in their management of affairs; they
neither acknowledged the judgment, nor expected the deliverance, to come
from his hand. Note, Those are brutish people that do not seek the Lord,
that live without prayer, and live without God in the world. Every man
is either a saint or a brute. But it is sad indeed with a people when
their pastors, that should feed them with knowledge and understanding,
are themselves thus brutish. And what comes of it? Therefore they shall
not prosper; none of their attempts for the public safety shall succeed.
Note, Those cannot expect to prosper who do not by faith and prayer take
God along with them in all their ways. And, when the pastors are
brutish, what else can be expected but that all their flocks should be
scattered? For, if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the
ditch. The ruin of a people is often owing to the brutishness of their
pastors. 5. That the report of the enemy's approach was very dreadful
([Jer 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#022).md): The noise of the bruit
has come, of the report which at first was but whispered and bruited
abroad, as wanting confirmation. It now proves too true: A great
commotion arises out of the north country, which threatens to make all
the cities of Judah desolate and a den of dragons; for they must all
expect to be sacrificed to the avarice and fury of the Chaldean army.
And what else can that place expect but to be made a den of dragons
which has by sin made itself a den of thieves?

III\. He turns to God, and addresses himself to him, finding it to
little purpose to speak to the people. It is some comfort to poor
ministers that, if men will not hear them, God will; and to him they
have liberty of access at all times. Let them close their preaching with
prayer, as the prophet, and then they shall have no reason to say that
they have laboured in vain.

1\. The prophet here acknowledges the sovereignty and dominion of the
divine Providence, that by it, and not by their own will and wisdom, the
affairs both of nations and particular persons are directed and
determined, [Jer 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#023.md). This is an
article of our faith which it is very proper for us to make confession
of at the throne of grace when we are complaining of an affliction or
suing for a mercy: "O Lord, I know, and believe, that the way of man is
not in himself; Nebuchadnezzar did not come of himself against our land,
but by the direction of a divine Providence." We cannot of ourselves do
any thing for our own relief, unless God work with us and command
deliverance for us; for it is not in man that walketh to direct his
steps, though he seem in his walking to be perfectly at liberty and to
choose his own way. Those that had promised themselves a long enjoyment
of their estates and possessions were made to know, by sad experience,
when they were thrown out by the Chaldeans, that the way of man is not
in himself; he designs which men lay deep, and think well-formed, are
dashed to pieces in a moment. We must all apply this to ourselves, and
mix faith with it, that we are not at our own disposal, but under a
divine direction; the event is often overruled so as to be quite
contrary to our intention and expectation. We are not masters of our own
way, nor can we think that every thing should be according to our mind;
we must therefore refer ourselves to God and acquiesce in his will. Some
think that the prophet here mentions this with a design to make this
comfortable use of it, that, the way of the Chaldean army being not in
themselves, they can do no more than God permits them; he can set bounds
to thee proud waves, and say, Hitherto they shall come, and no further.
And a quieting consideration it is that the most formidable enemies have
no power against us but what is given them from above.

2\. He deprecates the divine wrath, that it might not fall upon God's
Israel, [Jer 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#024.md). He speaks not for
himself only, but on the behalf of his people: O Lord, correct me, but
with judgment (in measure and with moderation, and in wisdom, no more
than is necessary for driving out of the foolishness that is bound up in
our hearts), not in thy anger (how severe soever the correction be, let
it come from thy love, and be designed for our good and made to work for
good), not to bring us to nothing, but to bring us home to thyself. Let
it not be according to the desert of our sins, but according to the
design of thy grace. Note, (1.) We cannot pray in faith that we may
never be corrected, while we are conscious to ourselves that we need
correction and deserve it, and know that as many as God loves he
chastens. (2.) The great thing we should dread in affliction is the
wrath of God. Say not, Lord, do not correct me, but, Lord, do not
correct me in anger; for that will infuse wormwood and gall into the
affliction and misery that will bring us to nothing. We may bear the
smart of his rod, but we cannot bear the weight of his wrath.

3\. He imprecates the divine wrath against the oppressors and
persecutors of Israel ([Jer 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#025).md):
Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not. This prayer does
not come from a spirit of malice or revenge, nor is it intended to
prescribe to God whom he should execute his judgments upon, or in what
order; but, (1.) It is an appeal to his justice. As if he had said,
"Lord, we are a provoking people; but are there not other nations that
are more so? And shall we only be punished? We are thy children, and may
expect a fatherly correction; but they are thy enemies, and against them
we have reason to think thy indignation should be, not against us." This
is God's usual method. The cup put into the hands of God's people is
full of mixtures, mixtures of mercy; but the dregs of the cup are
reserved for the wicked of the earth, let them wring them out, [Psa
75:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008). (2..md) It is a prediction of God's
judgments upon all the impenitent enemies of his church and kingdom. If
judgment begin thus at the house of God, what shall be the end of those
that obey not his gospel? [Pe1 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017.md).
See how the heathen are described, on whom God's fury shall be poured
out. \[1.\] They are strangers to God, and are content to be so. they
know him not, nor desire to know him. They are families that live
without prayer, that have nothing of religion among them; they call not
on God's name. Those that restrain prayer prove that they know not God;
for those that know him will seek to him and entreat his favour. \[2.\]
They are persecutors of the people of God and are resolved to be so.
They have eaten up Jacob with as much greediness as those that are
hungry eat their necessary food; nay, with more, they have devoured him,
and consumed him, and made his habitation desolate, that is, the land in
which he lives, or the temple of God, which is his habitation among
them. Note, What the heathen, in their rage and malice, do against the
people of God, though therein he makes use of them as the instruments of
his correction, yet he will, for that, make them the objects of his
indignation. This prayer is taken from [Psa
79:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#006.md), [Psa
79:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#007.md).
