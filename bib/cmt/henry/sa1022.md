### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 22:0</span></span>

David, being driven from Achish, returns into the land of Israel to be
hunted by Saul. I. David sets up his standard in the cave of Adullam,
entertains his relations ([Sa1 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001).md),
enlists soldiers ([Sa1 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#002).md), but
removes his aged parents to a more quiet settlement ([Sa1
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#003.md), [Sa1
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#004).md), and has the prophet Gad for his
counsellor ([Sa1 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#005).md). Saul resolves
to pursue him and find him out, complains of his servants and Jonathan
([Sa1 22:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#006).md), and, finding by Doeg's
information that Ahimelech had been kind to David, he ordered him and
all the priests that were with him, eighty-five in all, to be put to
death, and all that belonged to them destroyed ([Sa1
22:9-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#009).md) from the barbarous execution
of which sentence Abiathar escaped to David ([Sa1
22:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#020).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 22:1</span></span>

Here, I. David shelters himself in the cave of Adullam, [Sa1
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001.md). Whether it was a natural or
artificial fastness does not appear; it is probable that the access to
it was so difficult that David thought himself able, with Goliath's
sword, to keep it against all the forces of Saul, and therefore buried
himself alive in it, while he was waiting to see (and he says here, [Sa1
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#003).md) what God would do with him. The
promise of the kingdom implied a promise of preservation to it, and yet
David used proper means for his own safety, otherwise he would have
tempted God. He did not do any thing that aimed to destroy Saul, but
only to secure himself. He that might have done great service to his
country as a judge or general is here shut up in a cave, and thrown by
as a vessel in which there was no pleasure. We must not think it strange
if sometimes shining lights be thus eclipsed and hidden under a bushel.
Perhaps the apostle refers to this instance of David, among others, when
he speaks of some of the Old Testament worthies that wandered in
deserts, in dens and caves of the earth, [Heb
11:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#038.md). It was at this time that David
penned [Psa 142:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#001.md), which is
entitled, A prayer when David was in the cave; and there he complains
that no man would know him and that refuge failed him, but hopes that
shortly the righteous would compass him about.

II\. Thither his relations flocked to him, his brethren and all his
father's house, to be protected by him, to give assistance to him, and
to take their lot with him. A brother is born for adversity. Now, Joab,
and Abishai, and the rest of his relations, came to him, to suffer and
venture with him, in hopes shortly to be advanced with him; and they
were so. The first three of his worthies were those that first owed him
when he was in the cave, [Ch1 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#015.md),
etc.

III\. Here he began to raise forces in his own defence, [Sa1
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#002.md). He found by the late experiments
he had made that he could not save himself by flight, and therefore was
necessitated to do it by force, wherein he never acted offensively,
never offered any violence to his prince nor gave any disturbance to the
peace of the kingdom, but only used his forces as a guard to his own
person. But, whatever defence his soldiers were to him, they did him no
great credit, for the regiment he had was made up not of great men, nor
rich men, nor stout men, no, nor good men, but men in distress, in debt,
and discontented, men of broken fortunes and restless spirits, that were
put to their shifts, and knew not well what to do with themselves. When
David had fixed his headquarters in the cave of Adullam, they came and
enlisted themselves under him to the number of about 400. See what weak
instruments God sometimes makes use of, by which to bring about his own
purposes. The Son of David is ready to receive distressed souls, that
will appoint him their captain and be commanded by him.

IV\. He took care to settle his parents in a place of safety. No such
place could he find in all the land of Israel while Saul was so bitterly
enraged against him and all that belonged to him for his sake; he
therefore goes with them to the king of Moab, and puts them under his
protection, [Sa1 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#003.md), [Sa1
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#004.md). Observe here, 1. With what a
tender concern he provided for his aged parents. It was not fit they
should be exposed either to the frights or to the fatigues which he must
expect during his struggle with Saul (their age would by no means bear
such exposure); therefore the first thing he does is to find them a
quiet habitation, whatever became of himself. Let children learn from
this to show pity at home and requite their parents ([Ti1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#004).md), in every thing consulting their
ease and satisfaction. Though ever so highly preferred, and ever so much
employed, let them not forget their aged parents. 2. With what a humble
faith he expects the issue of his present distresses: Till I know what
God will do for me. He expresses his hopes very modestly, as one that
had entirely cast himself upon God and committed his way to him,
expecting a good issue, not from his own arts, or arms, or merits, but
from what the wisdom, power, and goodness of God would do for him. Now
David's father and mother forsook him, but God did not, [Psa
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010.md).

V. He had the advice and assistance of the prophet Gad, who probably was
one of the sons of the prophets that were brought up under Samuel, and
was by him recommended to David for his chaplain or spiritual guide.
Being a prophet, he would pray for him and instruct him in the mind of
God; and David, though he was himself a prophet, was glad of his
assistance. He advised him to go into the land of Judah ([Sa1
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#005).md), as one that was confident of
his own innocency, and was well assured of the divine protection, and
was desirous, even in his present hard circumstances, to do some service
to his tribe and country. Let him not be ashamed to own his own cause
nor decline the succours that would be offered him. Animated by this
word, there he determined to appear publicly. Thus are the steps of a
good man ordered by the Lord.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 22:6</span></span>

We have seen the progress of David's troubles; now here we have the
progress of Saul's wickedness. He seems to have laid aside the thoughts
of all other business and to have devoted himself wholly to the pursuit
of David. He heard at length, by the common fame of the country, that
David was discovered (that is, that he appeared publicly and enlisted
men into his service); and hereupon he called all his servants about
him, and sat down under a tree, or grove, in the high place at Gibeah,
with his spear in his hand for a sceptre, intimating the force by which
he designed to rule, and the present temper of his spirit, or its
distemper rather, which was to kill all that stood in his way. In this
bloody court of inquisition,

I. Saul seeks for information against David and Jonathan, [Sa1
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#007.md), [Sa1
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#008.md). Two things he was willing to
suspect and desirous to see proved, that he might wreak his malice upon
two of the best and most excellent men he had about him: - 1. That his
servant David did lie in wait for him and seek his life, which was
utterly false. He really sought David's life, and therefore pretended
that David sought his life, though he could not charge him with any
overt act that gave the least shadow of suspicion. 2. That his son
Jonathan stirred him up to do so, and was confederate with him in
compassing and imagining the death of the king. This also was
notoriously false. A league of friendship there was between David and
Jonathan, but no conspiracy in any evil thing; none of the articles of
their covenant carried any mischief to Saul. If Jonathan had agreed,
after the death of Saul, to resign to David, in compliance with the
revealed will of God, what harm would that do to Saul? Yet thus the best
friends to their prince and country have often been odiously represented
as enemies to both; even Christ himself was so. Saul took it for granted
that Jonathan and David were in a plot against him, his crown and
dignity, and was displeased with his servants that they did not give him
information of it, supposing that they could not but know it; whereas
really there was no such thing. See the nature of a jealous malice, and
its pitiful arts to extort discoveries of things that are not. He looked
upon all about him as his enemies because they did not say just as he
said; and told them, (1.) That they were very unwise, and acted against
the interest both of their tribe (for they were Benjamites, and David,
if he were advanced, would bring the honour into Judah which was now in
Benjamin) and of their families; for David would never be able to give
them such rewards as he had for them, of fields and vineyards, and such
preferments, to be colonels and captains. (2.) That they were
unfaithful: You have conspired against me. What a continual agitation
and torment are those in that give way to a spirit of jealousy! If a
ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked ([Pro
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#012).md), that is, they seem to be so in
his eyes. (3.) That they were very unkind. He thought to work upon their
good nature with that word: There is none of you that is so much as
sorry for me, or solicitous for me, as some read it. By these reasonings
he stirred them up to act vigorously, as the instruments of his malice,
that they might take away his suspicions of them.

II\. Though he could not learn any thing from his servants against David
or Jonathan, yet he got information from Doeg against Ahimelech the
priest.

1\. An indictment is brought against Ahimelech by Doeg, and he himself
is evidence against him, [Sa1 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#009.md),
[Sa1 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#010.md). Perhaps Doeg, as bad as he
was, would not have given this information if Saul had not extorted it,
for had he been very forward to it he would have done it sooner: but now
he thinks they must be all deemed traitors if none of them be accusers,
and therefore tells Saul what kindness Ahimelech had shown to David,
which he himself happened to be an eye-witness of. He had enquired of
God for him (which the priest used not to do but for public persons and
about public affairs) and he had furnished him with bread and a sword.
All this was true; but it was not the whole truth. He ought to have told
Saul further that David had made Ahimelech believe he was then going
upon the king's business; so that what service he did to David, however
it proved, was designed in honour to Saul, and this would have cleared
Ahimelech, whom Saul had in his power, and would have thrown all the
blame upon David, who was out of his reach.

2\. Ahimelech is seized, or summoned rather to appear before the king,
and upon this indictment he is arraigned. The king sent for him and all
the priests who then attended the sanctuary, whom he supposed to be
aiding and abetting; and they, not being conscious of any guilt, and
therefore not apprehensive of any danger, came all of them to the king
([Sa1 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#011).md), and none of them
attempted to make an escape, or to flee to David for shelter, as they
would have done now that he had set up his standard if they had been as
much in his interests as Saul suspected they were. Saul arraigns
Ahimelech himself with the utmost disdain and indignation ([Sa1
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#012).md): Hear now, thou son of Ahitub;
not so much as calling him by his name, much less giving him his title
of distinction. By this it appears that he had cast off the fear of God,
that he showed no respect at all to his priests, but took a pleasure in
affronting them and insulting them. Ahimelech holds up his hand at the
bar in those words: "Here I am, my lord, ready to hear my charge,
knowing I have done no wrong." He does not object to the jurisdiction of
Saul's court, nor insist upon an exemption as a priest, no, not though
he is a high priest, to which office that of the judge, or chief
magistrate, had not long since been annexed; but Saul having now the
sovereignty vested in him, in things pertaining to the king, even the
high priest sets himself on a level with common Israelites. Let every
soul be subject (even clergymen) to the higher powers.

3\. His indictment is read to him ([Sa1
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#013).md), that he, as a false traitor,
had joined himself with the son of Jesse in a plot to depose and murder
the king. "His design" (says Saul) "was to rise up against me, and thou
didst assist him with victuals and arms." See what bad constructions the
most innocent actions are liable to, how unsafe those are that live
under a tyrannical government, and what reason we have to be thankful
for the happy constitution and administration of the government we are
under.

4\. To this indictment he pleads, Not guilty, [Sa1
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#014.md), [Sa1
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#015.md). He owns the fact, but denies
that he did it traitorously or maliciously, or with any design against
the king. He pleads that he was so far from knowing of any quarrel
between Saul and David that he really took David to have been then as
much in favour at court as ever he had been. Observe, He does not plead
that David had told him an untruth, and with that had imposed upon him,
though really it was so, because he would not proclaim the weakness of
so good a man, no, not for his own vindication, especially to Saul, who
sought all occasions against him; but he insists upon the settled
reputation David had as the most faithful of all the servants of Saul,
the honour the king had put upon him in marrying his daughter to him,
the use the king had often made of him, and the trust he had reposed on
him: "He goes at thy bidding, and is honourable in thy house, and
therefore any one would think it a meritorious piece of service to the
crown to show him respect, so far from apprehending it to be a crime."
He pleads that he had been wont to enquire of God for him when he was
sent by Saul upon any expedition, and did it now as innocently as ever
he had done it. He protests his abhorrence of the thought of being in a
plot against the king: "Be it far from me. I mind my own business, and
meddle not with state matters." He begs the king's favour: "Let him not
impute any crime to us;" and concludes with a declaration of his
innocency: Thy servant knew nothing of all this. Could any man plead
with more evidences of sincerity? Had he been tried by a jury of honest
Israelites, he would certainly have been acquitted, for who can find any
fault in him? But,

5\. Saul himself gives judgment against him ([Sa1
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#016).md): Thou shalt surely die,
Ahimelech, as a rebel, thou and all thy father's house. What could be
more unjust? I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness
was there, [Ecc 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016). (1..md) It was
unjust that Saul should himself, himself alone, give judgment in his own
cause, without any appeal to judge or prophet, to his privy council, or
to a council of war. (2.) That so fair a plea should be overruled and
rejected without any reason given, or any attempt to disprove the
allegations of it, but purely with a high hand. (3.) That sentence
should be passed so hastily and with so much precipitation, the judge
taking no time himself to consider of it, nor allowing the prisoner any
time to move in arrest of judgment. (4.) That the sentence should be
passed not only on Ahimelech, himself, who was the only person accused
by Doeg, but on all his father's house, against whom nothing was
alleged: must the children be put to death for the fathers? (5.) That
the sentence should be pronounced in passion, not for the support of
justice, but for the gratification of his brutish rage.

6\. He issues out a warrant (a verbal warrant only) for the immediate
execution of this bloody sentence.

(1.) He ordered his footmen to be the executioners of this sentence, but
they refused, [Sa1 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#017.md). Hereby he
intended to put a further disgrace upon the priests; they may not die by
the hands of the men of war (as [Kg1
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#029).md) or his usual ministers of
justice, but his footmen must triumph over them, and wash their hands in
their blood. \[1.\] Never was the command of a prince more barbarously
given: Turn and slay the priests of the Lord. This is spoken with such
an air of impiety as can scarcely be paralleled. Had he seemed to forget
their sacred office or relation to God, and taken no notice of that, he
would thereby have intimated some regret that men of that character
should fall under his displeasure; but to call them the priests of the
Lord, when he ordered his footmen to cut their throats, looked as if,
upon that very account, he hated them. God having rejected him, and
ordered another to be anointed in his room, he seems well pleased with
this opportunity of being revenged on the priests of the Lord, since God
himself was out of his reach. What wickedness will not the evil spirit
hurry men to, when he gets the dominion! He alleged, in his order that
which was utterly false and unproved to him, that they knew when David
fled; whereas they knew nothing of the matter. But malice and murder are
commonly supported with lies. \[2.\] Never was the command of a prince
more honourably disobeyed. The footmen had more sense and grace than
their master. Though they might expect to be turned out of their places,
if not punished and put to death for their refusal, yet, come on them
what would, they would not offer to fall upon the priests of the Lord,
such a reverence had they for their office, and such a conviction of
their innocence.

(2.) He ordered Doeg (the accuser) to be the executioner, and he obeyed.
One would have thought that the footmen's refusal would awaken Saul's
conscience, and that he would not insist upon the doing of a thing so
barbarous as that his footmen startled at the thought of it. But his
mind was blinded and his heart hardened, and, if they will not do it,
the hands of the witness shall be upon the victims, [Deu
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#007.md). The most bloody tyrants have
found out instruments of their cruelty as barbarous as themselves. Doeg
is no sooner commanded to fall upon the priests than he does it
willingly enough, and, meeting with no resistance, slays with his own
hand (for aught that appears) on that same day eighty-five priests that
were of the age of ministration, between twenty and fifty, for they wore
a linen ephod ([Sa1 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#018).md), and
perhaps appeared at this time before Saul in their habits, and were
slain in them. This (one would think) was enough to satiate the most
blood-thirsty; but the horseleech of persecution still cries, "Give,
give." Doeg, by Saul's order no doubt, having murdered the priests, went
to their city Nob, and put all to the sword there ([Sa1
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#019).md), men, women, and children, and
the cattle too. Barbarous cruelty, and such as one cannot think of
without horror! Strange that ever it should enter into the heart of man
to be so impious, so inhuman! We may see in this, \[1.\] The desperate
wickedness of Saul when the Spirit of the Lord had departed from him.
Nothing so vile but those may be hurried to it who have provoked God to
give them up to their hearts' lusts. He that was so compassionate as to
spare Agag and the cattle of the Amalekites, in disobedience to the
command of God, could now, with unrelenting bowels, see the priests of
the Lord murdered, and nothing spared of all that belonged to them. For
that sin God left him to this. \[2.\] The accomplishment of the
threatenings long since pronounced against the house of Eli; for
Ahimelech and his family were descendants from him. Though Saul was
unrighteous in doing this, yet God was righteous in permitting it. Now
God performed against Eli that at which the ears of those that heard it
must needs tingle, as he had told him that he would judge his house for
ever [Sa1 3:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#011.md). No word of God
shall fall to the ground. \[3.\] This may be considered as a great
judgment upon Israel, and the just punishment of their desiring a king
before the time God intended them one. How deplorable was the state of
religion at this time in Israel! Though the ark had long been in
obscurity, yet it was some comfort to them that they had the altar, and
priests to serve at it; but now to see their priests weltering in their
own blood, and the heirs of the priesthood too, and the city of the
priests made a desolation, so that the altar of God must needs be
neglected for want of attendants, and this by the unjust and cruel order
of their own king to satisfy his brutish rage - this could not but go to
the heart of all pious Israelites, and make them wish a thousand times
they had been satisfied with the government of Samuel and his sons. The
worst enemies of their nation could not have done them a greater
mischief.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 22:20</span></span>

Here is, 1. The escape of Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, out of the
desolations of the priests' city. Probably when his father went to
appear, upon Saul's summons, he was left at home to attend the altar, by
which means he escaped the first execution, and, before Doeg and his
bloodhounds came to Nob, he had intelligence of the danger, and had time
to shift for his own safety. And whither should he go but to David? [Sa1
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#020.md). Let those that suffer for the
Son of David commit the keeping of their souls to him, [Pe1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#019.md). 2. David's resentment of the
melancholy tidings he brought. He gave David an account of the bloody
work Saul had made among the priests of the Lord ([Sa1
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#021).md), as the disciples of John, when
their master was beheaded, went and told Jesus, [Mat
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#012.md). And David greatly lamented the
calamity itself, but especially his being accessory to it: I have
occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house, [Sa1
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#022.md). Note, It is a great trouble to
a good man to find himself in any way an occasion of the calamities of
the church and ministry. David knew Doeg's character so well that he
feared he would do some such mischief as this when he saw him at the
sanctuary: I knew he would tell Saul. He calls him Doeg the Edomite,
because he retained the heart of an Edomite, though, by embracing the
profession of the Jewish religion, he had put on the mask of an
Israelite. 3. The protection he granted to Abiathar. He perceived him to
be terrified, as he had reason to be, and therefore bade him not to
fear, he would be as careful for him as for himself: With me thou shalt
be in safeguard, [Sa1 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#023.md). David,
having now time to recollect himself, speaks with assurance of his own
safety, and promises that Abiathar shall have the full benefit of his
protection. It is promised to the Son of David that God will hide him in
the shadow of his hand ([Isa 49:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#002).md),
and, with him, all that are his may be sure that they shall be in
safeguard, [Psa 91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md). David had now
not only a prophet, but a priest, a high-priest, with him, to whom he
was a blessing and they to him, and both a happy omen of his success.
Yet it appears (by [Psa 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#006).md) that
Saul had a high priest too, for he had a urim to consult: it is supposed
that he preferred Ahitub the father of Zadok, of the family of Eleazar
([Ch1 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#008).md), for even those that hate
the power of godliness yet will not be without the form. It must not be
forgotten here that David at this time penned [Psa
52:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001.md), as appears by the title of
that psalm, wherein he represents Doeg not only as malicious and
spiteful, but as false and deceitful, because though what he said was,
for the substance of it, true, yet he put false colours upon it, with a
design to do mischief. Yet even then, when the priesthood had become as
a withered branch, he looks upon himself as a green olive-tree in the
house of God, [Psa 52:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#008.md). In this great
hurry and distraction that David was continually in, yet he found both
time and a heart for communion with God, and found comfort in it.
