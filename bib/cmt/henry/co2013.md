### [2 Corinthians Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">co2 13:0</span></span>

In this chapter the apostle threatens to be severe against obstinate
sinners, and assigns the reason thereof ([Co2
13:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001).md); then he makes a suitable
prayer to God on the behalf of the Corinthians, with the reasons
inducing him thereto ([Co2 13:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#007).md),
and concludes his epistle with a valediction and a benediction ([Co2
13:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011).md).

[2 Corinthians 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 13:1</span></span>

In these verses observe,

I. The apostle threatens to be severe against obstinate sinners when he
should come to Corinth, having now sent to them a first and second
epistle, with proper admonitions and exhortations, in order to reform
what was amiss among them. Concerning this we may notice, 1. The caution
with which he proceeded in his censures: he was not hasty in using
severity, but gave a first and second admonition. So some understand his
words ([Co2 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001).md): This is the third
time I am coming to you, referring to his first and second epistles, by
which he admonished them, as if he were present with them, though in
person he was absent, [Co2 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#002.md).
According to this interpretation, these two epistles are the witnesses
he means in the first verse, referring rather to the direction of our
Saviour ([Mat 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#016).md) concerning the
manner how Christians should deal with offenders before they proceed to
extremity than to the law of Moses ([Deu
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#006.md); [Deu
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015).md) for the behaviour of judges in
criminal matters. We should go, or send, to our brother, once and again,
to tell him of his fault. Thus the apostle had told these Corinthians
before, in his former epistle, and now he tells them, or writes to those
who heretofore had sinned, and to all others, giving warning unto all
before he came in person the third time, to exercise severity against
scandalous offenders. Others think that the apostle had designed and
prepared for his journey to Corinth twice already, but was
providentially hindered, and now informs them of his intentions a third
time to come to them. However this be, it is observable that he kept an
account how often he endeavoured, and what pains he took with these
Corinthians for their good: and we may be sure that an account is kept
in heaven, and we must be reckoned with another day for the helps we
have had for our souls, and how we have improved them. 2. The
threatening itself: That if (or when) he came again (in person) he would
not spare obstinate sinners, and such as were impenitent, in their
scandalous enormities. He had told them before, he feared God would
humble him among them, because he should find some who had sinned and
had not repented; and now he declares he would not spare such, but would
inflict church-censures upon them, which are thought to have been
accompanied in those early times with visible and extraordinary tokens
of divine displeasure. Note, Though it is God's gracious method to bear
long with sinners, yet he will not bear always; at length he will come,
and will not spare those who remain obstinate and impenitent,
notwithstanding all his methods to reclaim and reform them.

II\. The apostle assigns a reason why he would be thus severe, namely,
for a proof of Christ's speaking in him, which they sought after, [Co2
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#003.md). The evidence of his apostleship
was necessary for the credit, confirmation, and success, of the gospel
he preached; and therefore such as denied this were justly and severely
to be censured. It was the design of the false teachers to make the
Corinthians call this matter into question, of which yet they had not
weak, but strong and mighty proofs ([Co2
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#003).md), notwithstanding the mean figure
he made in the world and the contempt which by some was cast upon him.
Even as Christ himself was crucified through weakness, or appeared in
his crucifixion as a weak and contemptible person, but liveth by the
power of God, or in his resurrection and life manifests his divine power
([Co2 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#004).md), so the apostles, how mean
and contemptible soever they appeared to the world, did yet, as
instruments, manifest the power of God, and particularly the power of
his grace, in converting the world to Christianity. And therefore, as a
proof to those who among the Corinthians sought a proof of Christ's
speaking in the apostle, he puts them upon proving their Christianity
([Co2 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#005).md): Examine yourselves, etc.
Hereby he intimates that, if they could prove their own Christianity,
this would be a proof of his apostleship; for if they were in the faith,
if Jesus Christ was in them, this was a proof that Christ spoke in him,
because it was by his ministry that they did believe. He had been not
only an instructor, but a father to them. He had begotten them again by
the gospel of Christ. Now it could not be imagined that a divine power
should go along with his ministrations if he had not his commission from
on high. If therefore they could prove themselves not to be reprobates,
not to be rejected of Christ, he trusted they would know that he was not
a reprobate ([Co2 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#006).md), not disowned
by Christ. What the apostle here says of the duty of the Corinthians to
examine themselves, etc., with the particular view already mentioned, is
applicable to the great duty of all who call themselves Christians, to
examine themselves concerning their spiritual state. We should examine
whether we be in the faith, because it is a matter in which we may be
easily deceived, and wherein a deceit is highly dangerous: we are
therefore concerned to prove our own selves, to put the question to our
own souls, whether Christ be in us, or not; and Christ is in us, except
we be reprobates: so that either we are true Christians or we are great
cheats; and what a reproachful thing is it for a man not to know
himself, not to know his own mind!

[2 Corinthians 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 13:7</span></span>

Here we have,

I. The apostle's prayer to God on the behalf of the Corinthians, that
they might do no evil, [Co2 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#007.md). This
is the most desirable thing we can ask of God, both for ourselves and
for our friends, to be kept from sin, that we and they may do no evil;
and it is most needful that we often pray to God for his grace to keep
us, because without this we cannot keep ourselves. We are more concerned
to pray that we may not do evil than that we may not suffer evil.

II\. The reasons why the apostle put up this prayer to God on behalf of
the Corinthians, which reasons have a special reference to their case,
and the subject-matter about which he was writing to them. Observe, he
tells them, 1. It was not so much for his own personal reputation as for
the honour of religion: "Not that we should appear approved, but that
you should do that which is honest, or decent, and for the credit of
religion, though we should be reproached and vilified, and accounted as
reprobates," [Co2 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#007). Note, (1..md) The
great desire of faithful ministers of the gospel is that the gospel they
preach may be honoured, however their persons may be vilified. (2.) The
best way to adorn our holy religion is to do that which is honest, and
of good report, to walk as becomes the gospel of Christ. 2. Another
reason was this: that they might be free from all blame and censure when
he should come to them. This is intimated in [Co2
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#008.md), We can do nothing against the
truth, but for the truth. If therefore they did not do evil, nor act
contrary to their profession of the gospel, the apostle had no power nor
authority to punish them. He had said before ([Co2
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#008).md) and says here ([Co2
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#010).md) that the power which the Lord
had given him was to edification, not to destruction; so that, although
the apostle had great powers committed to him for the credit and
advancement of the gospel, yet he could not do anything to the
disparagement of the truth, nor the discouragement of those who obeyed
it. He could not, that is, he would not, he dared not, he had no
commission to act against the truth; and it is remarkable how the
apostle did rejoice in this blessed impotency: "We are glad," says he
([Co2 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#009).md), "when we are weak and you
are strong; that is, that we have no power to censure those who are
strong in faith and fruitful in good works." Some understand this
passage thus: "Though we are weak through persecutions and contempt, we
bear it patiently, and also joyfully, while we see that you are strong,
that you are prosperous in holiness, and persevering in well-doing."
For, 3. He desired their perfection ([Co2
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#009).md); that is, that they might be
sincere, and aim at perfection (sincerity is our gospel-perfection), or
else he wished there might be a thorough reformation among them. He not
only desired that they might be kept from sin, but also that they might
grow in grace, and increase in holiness, and that all that was amiss
among them might be rectified and reformed. This was the great end of
his writing this epistle, and that freedom he used with them by writing
these things (those friendly admonitions and warnings), being absent,
that so, being present, he should not use sharpness ([Co2
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#010).md), that is, not proceed to the
utmost extremity in the exercise of the power which the Lord had given
him as an apostle, to revenge all disobedience, [Co2
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#006.md).

[2 Corinthians 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 13:11</span></span>

Thus the apostle concludes this epistle with,

I. A valediction. He gives them a parting farewell, and takes his leave
of them for the present, with hearty good wishes for their spiritual
welfare. In order to this,

1\. He gives them several good exhortations. (1.) To be perfect, or to
be knit together in love, which would tend greatly to their advantage as
a church, or Christian society. (2.) To be of good comfort under all the
sufferings and persecutions they might endure for the cause of Christ or
any calamities and disappointments they might meet with in the world.
(3.) To be of one mind, which would greatly tend to their comfort; for
the more easy we are with our brethren the more ease we shall have in
our own souls. The apostle would have them, as far as was possible, to
be of the same opinion and judgment; however, if this could not be
attained, yet, (4.) He exhorts them to live in peace, that difference in
opinion should not cause an alienation of affections - that they should
be at peace among themselves. He would have all the schisms that were
among them healed, that there should be no more contention and wrath
found among them, to prevent which they should avoid debates, envyings,
backbitings, whisperings, and such like enemies to peace.

2\. He encourages them with the promise of God's presence among them:
The God of love and peace shall be with you, [Co2
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011). Note, (1..md) God is the God of
love and peace. He is the author of peace, and lover of concord. He hath
loved us, and is willing to be at peace with us; he commands us to love
him, and to be reconciled to him, and also that we love one another, and
be at peace among ourselves. (2.) God will be with those who live in
love and peace. He will love those who love peace; he will dwell with
them here, and they shall dwell with him for ever. Such shall have God's
gracious presence here, and be admitted to his glorious presence
hereafter.

3\. He gives directions to them to salute each other, and sends kind
salutations to them from those who were with him, [Co2
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#012.md), [Co2
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#013.md). He would have them testify
their affection to one another by the sacred rite of a kiss of charity,
which was then used, but has long been disused, to prevent all occasions
of wantonness and impurity, in the more declining and degenerate state
of the church.

II\. The apostolical benediction ([Co2
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#014).md): The grace of the Lord Jesus
Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be
with you all. Thus the apostle concludes his epistle, and thus it is
usual and proper to dismiss worshipping assemblies. This plainly proves
the doctrine of the gospel, and is an acknowledgment that Father, Son,
and Spirit, are three distinct persons, yet but one God; and herein the
same, that they are the fountain of all blessings to men. It likewise
intimates our duty, which is to have an eye by faith to Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost - to live in a continual regard to the three persons in the
Trinity, into whose name we were baptized, and in whose name we are
blessed. This is a very solemn benediction, and we should give all
diligence to inherit this blessing. The grace of Christ, the love of
God, and the communion (or communication) of the Holy Ghost: the grace
of Christ as Redeemer, the love of God who sent the Redeemer, and all
the communications of this grace and love, which come to us by the Holy
Ghost; it is the communications of the Holy Ghost that qualify us for an
interest in the grace of Christ, and the love of God: and we can desire
no more to make us happy than the grace of Christ, the love of God, and
the communion of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
