### [Ezra Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#001.md)

[Ezra](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ezr 8:0</span></span>

This chapter gives us a more particular narrative of Ezra's journey to
Jerusalem, of which we had a general account in the foregoing chapter I.
The company that went up with him (v. 1-20). II. The solemn fast which
he kept with his company, to implore God's presence with them in this
journey ([Ezr 8:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#021).md). III. The care
he took of the treasure he had with him, and the charge he gave
concerning it to the priests, to whose custody he committed it ([Ezr
8:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#024).md). IV. The care God took of him
and his company in the way ([Ezr
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#031).md). V. Their safe arrival at
Jerusalem, where they delivered their treasure to the priests ([Ezr
8:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#032).md), their commissions to the
kings lieutenants ([Ezr 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#036).md), offered
sacrifices to God ([Ezr 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#035).md), and
then applied to their business.

[Ezra 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 8:1</span></span>

Ezra, having received his commission from the king, beats up for
volunteers, as it were, sets up an ensign to assemble the outcasts of
Israel and the dispersed of Judah, [Isa
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012.md). "Whoever of the sons of Sion,
that swell with the daughters of Babylon, is disposed to go to
Jerusalem, now that the temple there is finished and the temple-service
set a-going, now is their time." Now one would think that under such a
leader, with such encouragements, all the Jews should at length have
shaken themselves from their dust, and loosed the bands of their neck,
according to that call, [Isa 52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001.md),
[Isa 52:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#002.md), etc. I wonder how any of
them could read that chapter and yet stay behind. But multitudes did.
They loved their ease better than their religion, thought themselves
well off where they were, and either believed not that Jerusalem would
better their condition or durst not go thither through any difficulties.
But here we are told,

I. That some offered themselves willingly to go with Ezra. The heads of
the several families are here named, for their honour, and the numbers
of the males that each brought in, amounting in all to 1496. Two priests
are named ([Ezr 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#002).md) and one of the
sons of David; but, it should seem, they came without their families,
probably intending to see how they liked Jerusalem and then either to
send for their families or return to them as they saw cause. Several of
their families, or clans, here named, we had before, ch. 2. Some went up
from them at that time, more went up now, as God inclined their hearts;
some were called into the vineyard at the third hour, others not till
the eleventh, yet even those were not rejected. But here we read of the
last sons of Adonikam ([Ezr 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#013).md),
which some understand to their dispraise, that they were the last that
enlisted themselves under Ezra; I rather understand it to their honour,
that now all the sons of that family returned and none staid behind.

II\. That the Levites who went in this company were in a manner pressed
into the service. Ezra appointed a general rendezvous of all his company
at a certain place upon new-year's day, the first day of the first
month. [Ezr 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#009.md). Then and there he
took a view of them, and mustered them, and (which was strange) found
there none of the sons of Levi, [Ezr
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#015.md). Some priests there were, but no
others that were Levites. Where was the spirit of that sacred tribe?
Ezra, a priest, like Moses proclaims, Who is on the Lord's side? They,
unlike to Levi, shrink, and desire to abide among the sheep-folds to
hear the bleatings of the flock. Synagogues we suppose they had in
Babylon, in which they prayed, and preached, and kept sabbaths (and,
when they could not have better, they had reason to be thankful for
them); but now that the temple at Jerusalem was opened, to the service
of which they were ordained, they ought to have preferred the gates of
Zion before all those synagogues. It is upon record here, to their
reproach; but tell it not in Gath. Ezra, when he observed that he had no
Levites in his retinue, was much at a loss. He had money enough for the
service of the temple, but wanted men. The king and princes had more
than done their part, but the sons of Levi had not half done theirs.
Eleven men, chief men, and men of understanding, he chooses out of his
company, to be employed for the filling up of this lamentable vacancy;
and here we are informed, 1. Of their being sent. Ezra sent them to a
proper place, where there as a college of Levites, the place Casiphia,
probably a street or square in Babylon allowed for that purpose - Silver
Street one may call it, for ceseph signifies silver. He sent them to a
proper person, to Iddo, the chief president of the college, not to urge
him to come himself (we will suppose him to be old and unfit for such a
remove), but to send some of the juniors, ministers for the house of our
God, [Ezr 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#017.md). The furnishing of
God's house with good ministers is a good work, which will redound to
the comfort and credit of all that have a hand in it. 2. Of their
success. They did not return without their errand, but, though the
warning was short, they brought about forty Levites to attend Ezra,
Sherebiah, noted as a very intelligent man, and eighteen with him ([Ezr
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#018).md). Hashabiah, and Jeshaiah, and
twenty with them, [Ezr 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#019.md). By this
it appears that they were not averse to go, but were slothful and
inattentive, and only wanted to be called upon and excited to go. What a
pity it is that good men should omit a good work, merely for want of
being spoken to! What a pity that they should need it, but, if they do,
what a pity that they should be left without it! Of the Nethinim, the
servitors of the sacred college, the species infima - the lowest order
of the temple ministers, more appeared forward to go than of the Levites
themselves. Of them 220, upon this hasty summons, enlisted themselves,
and had the honour to be expressed by name in Ezra's muster-roll, [Ezr
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#020.md). "Thus," says Ezra, "were we
furnished with Levites, by the good hand of our God upon us." If, where
ministers have been wanting, the vacancies are well supplied, let God
have the glory, and his good hand be acknowledged as qualifying them for
the service, inclining them to it, and then opening a door of
opportunity for them.

[Ezra 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ezr 8:21</span></span>

Ezra has procured Levites to go along with him; but what will that
avail, unless he have God with him? That is therefore his chief care. In
all our ways we must acknowledge God, and in those particularly wherein
we are endeavouring to serve the interest of his kingdom among men. Ezra
does so here. Observe,

I. The stedfast confidence he had in God and in his gracious protection.
He told the king ([Ezr 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#022).md) what
principles he went upon, that those who seek God are safe under the
shadow of his wings, even in their greats dangers, but that those who
forsake him are continually exposed, even when they are most secure.
God's servants have his power engaged for them; his enemies have it
engaged against them. This Ezra believed with his heart, and with his
mouth made confession of it before the king; and therefore he was
ashamed to ask of the king a convoy, lest thereby he should give
occasion to the king, and those about him, to suspect either God's power
to help his people or Ezra's confidence in that power. Those that trust
in God, and triumph in him, will be ashamed of seeking to the creature
for protection, especially of using any sorry shifts for their own
safety, because thereby they contradict themselves and their own
confidence. Not but that those who depend upon God must use proper means
for their preservation, and they need not be ashamed to do so; but, when
the honour of God is concerned, one would rather expose one's-self than
do any thing to the prejudice of that, which ought to be dearer to us
than our lives.

II\. The solemn application he made to God in that confidence: He
proclaimed a fast, [Ezr 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#021.md). No doubt
he had himself begged of God direction in this affair from the first
time he had it in his thoughts; but for public mercies public prayers
must be made, that all who are to share in the comfort of them may join
in the request for them. Their fasting was, 1. To express their
humiliation. This he declares to be the intent and meaning of it. "that
we might afflict ourselves before our God for our sins, and so be
qualified for the pardon of them." When we are entering upon any new
condition of life our care should be to bring none of the guilt of the
sins of our former condition into it. When we are in any imminent peril
let us be sure to make our peace with God, and then we are safe: nothing
can do us any real hurt. 2. To excite their supplications. Prayer was
always joined with religious fasting. Their errand to the throne of
grace was to seek of God the right way, that is, to commit themselves to
the guidance of the divine Providence, to put themselves under the
divine protection, and to beg of God to guide and keep them in their
journey and bring them safely to their journey's end. They were
strangers in the road, were to march through their enemies' countries,
and had not a pillar of cloud and fire to lead them, as their fathers
had; but they believed that the power and favour of God, and the
ministration of his angels, would be to them instead of that, and hoped
by prayer to obtain divine assistance. Note, All our concerns about
ourselves, our families, and our estates, it is our wisdom and duty by
prayer to commit to God, and leave the care of with him, [Phi
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006.md).

III\. The good success of their doing so ([Ezr
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#023).md): We besought our God by
joint-prayer, and he was entreated of us. They had some comfortable
assurance in their own minds that their prayers were answered, and the
event declared it; for never any that sought God in earnest sought him
in vain.

[Ezra 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ezr 8:24</span></span>

We have here an account of the particular care which Ezra took of the
treasure he had with him, that belonged to God's sanctuary, Observe, 1.
Having committed the keeping of it to God, he committed the keeping of
it to proper men, whose business it was to watch it, though without God
they would have waked in vain. Note, Our prayers must always be seconded
with our endeavours; the care of Christ's gospel, his church, and
ordinances, must not be so left with him but that it must also be
committed to faithful men, [Ti2 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#002.md).
2. Having prayed to God to preserve all the substance they had with
them, he shows himself especially solicitous for that part of it which
belonged to the house of God and was an offering to him. Do we expect
that God should, by his providence, keep that which belongs to us? Let
us, by his grace, keep that which belongs to him. Let God's honour and
interest be our care; and then we may expect that our lives and comforts
will be his. Observe, (1.) The persons to whom he delivered the
offerings of the house of God. Twelve chief priests, and as many
Levites, he appointed to this trust ([Ezr
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#024.md), [Ezr
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#030).md), who were bound by their office
to take care of the things of God, and were in a particular manner to
have the benefit of these sacred treasures. Ezra tells them why he put
those things into their hands ([Ezr
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#028).md): You are holy unto the Lord, the
vessels are holy also; and who so fit to take care of holy things as
holy persons? Those that have the dignity and honour of the priesthood
must take along with them the trust and duty of it. The prophet is
foretelling the return of God's people and ministers out of Babylon,
when he gives the solemn charge ([Isa
52:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#011).md), Be you clean that bear the
vessels of the Lord. (2.) The great exactness with which he lodged this
trust in their hands: He weighed to them the silver, the gold, and the
vessels ([Ezr 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#025).md), because he
expected to have it from them again by weight. In all trust, but
especially sacred ones, we ought to be punctual, and preserve a right
understanding on both sides. In Zerubbabel's time the vessels were
delivered by number, here by weight, that all might be forth-coming and
it might easily appear if any were missing, to intimate that such as are
entrusted with holy things (as all the stewards of the mysteries of God
are) are concerned to remember, both in receiving their trust and in
discharging it, that they must shortly give a very particular account of
it, that they may be faithful to it and so give up their account with
joy. (3.) The charge he have them with these treasures ([Ezr
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#029).md): "Watch you, and keep them, that
they be not lost, nor embezzled, nor mingled with the other articles.
Keep them together; keep them by themselves; keep them safely, till you
weigh them in the temple, before the great men there," hereby intimating
how much it was their concern to be careful and faithful and how much it
would be their honour to be found so. Thus when Paul charges Timothy
with the gospel treasure he bids him keep it until the appearing of
Jesus Christ, and his appearing before him to give account of his trust,
when his fidelity would be his crown.

[Ezra 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ezr 8:31</span></span>

We are now to attend Ezra to Jerusalem, a journey of about four months
in all; but his multitude made his marches slow and his stages short.
Now here we are told,

I. That his God was good, and he acknowledged his goodness: The hand of
our God was upon us, to animate us for our undertaking. To him they owed
it, 1. That they were preserved in their journey, and not all cut off;
for there were enemies that laid wait for them by the way to do them a
mischief, or at least, like Amalek, to smite the hindmost of them, but
God protected them, [Ezr 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#031.md). Even
the common perils of journeys are such as oblige us to sanctify our
going out with prayer and our returns in peace with praise and
thanksgiving; much more ought God to be thus eyed in such a dangerous
expedition as this was. 2. That they were brought in safety to their
journey's end, [Ezr 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#032.md). Let those
that have stedfastly set their faces towards the new Jerusalem proceed
and persevere to the end till they appear before God in Zion, and they
shall find that he who has begun the good work will perform it.

II\. That his treasurers were faithful. When they had come to Jerusalem
they were impatient to be discharged of their trust, and therefore
applied to the great men of the temple, who received it from them and
gave them an acquittance in full, [Ezr
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#033.md), [Ezr
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#034.md). It is a great ease to one's mind
to be discharged from a trust, and a great honour to one's name to be
able to make it appear that it has been faithfully discharged.

III\. That his companions were devout. As soon as they came to be near
the altar they thought themselves obliged to offer sacrifice, whatever
they had done in Babylon, [Ezr 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#035.md).
That will be dispensed with when we want opportunity which when the door
is opened again will be expected from us. It is observable, 1. That
among their sacrifices they had a sin-offering; for it is the atonement
that sweetens and secures every mercy to us, which will not be truly
comfortable unless iniquity be taken away and our peace made with God.
2. That the number of their offerings related to the number of the
tribes, twelve bullocks, twelve he-goats, and ninety-six rams (that is,
eight times twelve), intimating the union of the two kingdoms, according
to what was foretold, [Eze 37:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#022.md). They
did not any longer go two tribes one way and ten another, but all the
twelve met by their representatives at the same altar.

IV\. That even the enemies of the Jews became their friends, bowed to
Ezra's commission, and, instead of hindering the people of God,
furthered them ([Ezr 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#036).md), purely in
complaisance to the king: when he appeared moderate they all coveted to
appear so too. Then had the churches rest.
