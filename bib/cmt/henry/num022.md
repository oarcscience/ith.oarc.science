### [Numbers Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 22:0</span></span>

At this chapter begins the famous story of Balak and Balaam, their
attempt to curse Israel, and the baffling of that attempt; God's people
are long afterwards told to remember what Balak the king of Moab
consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, that they might
know the righteousness of the Lord, [Mic
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#005.md). In this chapter we have, I.
Balak's fear of Israel, and the plot he had to get them cursed ([Num
22:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001).md). II. The embassy he sent to
Balaam, a conjurer, to fetch him for that purpose, and the
disappointment he met with in the first embassy ([Num
22:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#005).md). III. Balaam's coming to him
upon his second message ([Num
22:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#015).md). IV. The opposition Balaam
met with by the way ([Num 22:22-35](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#022).md).
V. The interview at length between Balak and Balaam ([Num
22:36](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#036), etc..md).

[Numbers 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 22:1</span></span>

The children of Israel have at length finished their wanderings in the
wilderness, out of which they went up ([Num
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#018).md), and are now encamped in the
plains of Moab near Jordan, where they continued till they passed
through Jordan under Joshua, after the death of Moses. Now we have here,

I. The fright which the Moabites were in upon the approach of Israel,
[Num 22:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#002.md). They needed not to fear
any harm from them if they knew (and it is probable that Moses let them
know) the orders God had given to Israel not to contend with the
Moabites, nor to use any hostility against them, [Deu
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009.md). But, if they had any notice of
this, they were jealous that it was but a sham, to make them secure,
that they might be the more easily conquered. Notwithstanding the old
friendship between Abraham and Lot, the Moabites resolved to ruin Israel
if they could, and therefore they will take it for granted, without any
ground for the suspicion, that Israel resolves to ruin them. Thus it is
common for those that design mischief to pretend that mischief is
designed against them; and their groundless jealousies must be the
colour of their causeless malice. They hear of their triumphs over the
Amorites ([Num 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#002).md), and think that
their own house is in danger when their neighbour's is on fire. They
observe their multitudes ([Num 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#003).md):
They were many; and hence infer how easily they would conquer their
country, and all about them if some speedy and effectual course were not
taken to stop the progress of their victorious arms: "They shall lick up
or devour us, and all that are round about us, as speedily and
irresistibly as the ox eats up the grass" ([Num
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#004).md), owning themselves to be an
unequal match for so formidable an enemy. Therefore they were sorely
afraid and distressed themselves; thus were the wicked in great fear
where no fear was, [Psa 53:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#005.md). These
fears they communicated to their neighbours, the elders of Midian, that
some measures might be concerted between them for their common safety;
for, if the kingdom of Moab fall, the republic of Midian cannot stand
long. The Moabites, if they had pleased, might have made a good use of
the advances of Israel, and their successes against the Amorites. They
had reason to rejoice, and give God and Israel thanks for freeing them
from the threatening power of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had taken
from them part of their country, and was likely to overrun the rest.
They had reason likewise to court Israel's friendship, and to come in to
their assistance; but having forsaken the religion of their father Lot,
and being sunk into idolatry, they hated the people of the God of
Abraham, and were justly infatuated in their counsels and given up to
distress.

II\. The project which the king of Moab formed to get the people of
Israel cursed, that is, to set God against them, who, he perceived,
hitherto fought for them. He trusted more to his arts than to his arms,
and had a notion that if he could but get some prophet or other, with
his powerful charms, to imprecate evil upon them, and to pronounce a
blessing upon himself and his forces, then, though otherwise too weak,
he should be able to deal with them. This notion arose, 1. Out of the
remains of some religion; for it owns a dependence upon some visible
sovereign powers that rule in the affairs of the children of men and
determine them, and an obligation upon us to make application to these
powers. 2. Out of the ruins of the true religion; for if the Midianites
and Moabites had not wretchedly degenerated from the faith and worship
of their pious ancestors, Abraham and Lot, they could not have imagined
it possible to do any mischief with their curses to a people who alone
adhered to the service of the true God, from whose service they had
themselves revolted.

III\. The court which he made to Balaam the son of Beor, a famous
conjurer, to engage him to curse Israel. The Balaam lived a great way
off, in that country whence Abraham came, and where Laban lived; but,
though it was probable that there were many nearer home that were
pretenders to divination, yet none had so great a reputation for success
as Balaam, and Balak will employ the best he can hear of, though he send
a great way for him, so much is his heart upon this project. And to gain
him, 1. He makes him his friend, complaining to him, as his confidant,
of the danger he was in from the numbers and neighbourhood of the camp
of Israel: They cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against
me, [Num 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#005.md). 2. In effect he makes
him his god, by the great power he attributes to his word: He whom thou
blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed, [Num
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#006.md). The learned bishop Patrick
inclines to think, with many of the Jewish writers, that Balaam had been
a great prophet, who, for the accomplishment of his predictions and the
answers of his prayers, both for good and evil, had been looked upon
justly as a man of great interest with God; but that, growing proud and
covetous, God departed from him, and then, to support his sinking
credit, he betook himself to diabolical arts. He is called a prophet
([Pe2 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#016),.md) because he had been one,
or perhaps he had raised his reputation from the first by his magical
charms, as Simon Magus, who bewitched the people so far that he was
called the great power of God, [Act
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#010.md). Curses pronounced by God's
prophets in the name of the Lord have wonderful effects, as Noah's ([Gen
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#025).md), and Elisha's, [Kg2
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#024.md). But the curse causeless shall
not come ([Pro 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#002).md), no more than
Goliath's, when he cursed David by his gods, [Sa1
17:43](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#043.md). Let us desire to have the
prayers of God's ministers and people for us, and dread having them
against us; for they are greatly regarded by him who blesseth indeed and
curseth indeed. But Balak cannot rely upon these compliments as
sufficient to prevail with Balaam, the main inducement is yet behind
([Num 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#007).md): they took the rewards of
divination in their hand, the wages of unrighteousness, which he loved,
[Pe2 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#015.md).

IV\. The restraint God lays upon Balaam, forbidding him to curse Israel.
It is very probable that Balaam, being a curious inquisitive man, was no
stranger to Israel's case and character, but had heard that God was with
them of a truth, so that he ought to have given the messengers their
answer immediately, that he would never curse a people whom God had
blessed; but he lodges the messengers, and takes a night's time to
consider what he shall do, and to receive instructions from God, [Num
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#008.md). When we enter into a parley with
temptations we are in great danger of being overcome by them. In the
night God comes to him, probably in a dream, and enquires what business
those strangers had with him. He knows it, but he will know it from him.
Balaam gives him an account of their errand ([Num
22:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#009).md), and God thereupon charges
him not to go with them, or attempt to curse that blessed people, [Num
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#012.md). Thus God sometimes, for the
preservation of his people, was pleased to speak to bad men, as to
Abimelech ([Gen 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#003).md), and to Laban,
[Gen 31:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#024.md). And we read of some that
were workers of iniquity, and yet in Christ's name prophesied, and did
many wondrous works. Balaam is charged not only not to go to Balak, but
not to offer to curse this people, which he might have attempted at a
distance; and the reason is given: They are blessed. This was part of
the blessing of Abraham ([Gen 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003).md), I
will curse him that curseth thee; so that an attempt to curse them would
be not only fruitless, but perilous. Israel had often provoked God in
the wilderness, yet he will not suffer their enemies to curse them, for
he rewards them not according to their iniquities. The blessedness of
those whose sin is covered comes upon them, [Rom
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#006.md), [Rom
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#007.md).

V. The return of the messengers without Balaam. 1. Balaam is not
faithful in returning God's answer to the messengers, [Num
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#013.md). He only tells them, the Lord
refuseth to give me leave to go with you. He did not tell them, as he
ought to have done, that Israel was a blessed people, and must by no
means be cursed; for then the design would have been crushed, and the
temptation would not have been renewed: but he, in effect, desired them
to give his humble service to Balak, and let him know that he applauded
his project, and would have been very glad to gratify him, but that
truly he had the character of a prophet, and must not go without leave
from God, which he had not yet obtained, and therefore for the present
he must be excused. Note, Those are a fair mark for Satan's temptation
that speak diminishingly of divine prohibitions, as if they amounted to
no more than the denial of a permission, and as if to go against God's
law were only to go without his leave. 2. The messengers are not
faithful in returning Balaam's answer to Balak. All the account they
give of it is, Balaam refuseth to come with us ([Num
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#014).md), intimating that he only wanted
more courtship and higher proffers; but they are not willing Balak
should know that God had signified his disallowance of the attempt. Thus
are great men wretchedly abused by the flatteries of those about them,
who do all they can to prevent their seeing their own faults and
follies.

[Numbers 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 22:15</span></span>

We have here a second embassy sent to Balaam, to fetch him over to curse
Israel. It were well for us if we were as earnest and constant in
prosecuting a good work, notwithstanding disappointments, as Balak was
in pursuing this ill design. The enemies of the church are restless and
unwearied in their attempts against it; but he that sits in heaven
laughs at them. Observe,

I. The temptation Balak laid before Balaam. He contrived to make this
assault more vigorous than the former. It is very probable that he sent
double money in the hands of his messengers; but, besides that, now he
tempted him with honours, laid a bait not only for his covetousness, but
for his pride and ambition. How earnestly should we beg of God daily to
mortify in us these two limbs of the old man! Those that know how to
look with a holy contempt upon worldly wealth and preferment will find
it not so hard a matter as most men do to keep a good conscience. See
how artfully Balak managed the temptation. 1. The messengers he sent
were more, and more honourable, [Num
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#015.md). He sent to this conjurer with
as great respect and deference to his quality as if he had been a
sovereign prince, apprehending perhaps that Balaam had thought himself
slighted in the fewness and meanness of the former messengers. 2. The
request was very urgent. This powerful prince becomes a suitor to him:
"Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee ([Num
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#016).md), no, not God, nor conscience,
nor any fear either of sin or shame." 3. The proffers were high: "I will
promote thee to very great honour among the princes of Moab;" nay, he
gives him a blank, and he shall write his own terms: I will do
whatsoever thou sayest, that is, "I will give thee whatever thou
desirest, and observe whatever thou orderest; thy word shall be a law to
me," [Num 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#017.md). Thus sinners stick at
no pains, spare no cost, and care not how low they stoop, for the
gratifying either of their luxury or of their malice; shall we then be
stiff and strait-handed in our compliance with the laws of virtue? God
forbid.

II\. Balaam's seeming resistance of, but real yielding to, this
temptation. We may here discern in Balaam a struggle between his
convictions and his corruptions. 1. His convictions charged him to
adhere to the command of God, and he spoke their language, [Num
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#018.md). Nor could any man have said
better: "If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, and
that is more than he can give or I can ask, I cannot go beyond the word
of the Lord my God." See how honourably he speaks of God; he is Jehovah,
my God. Note, Many call God theirs that are not his, not truly because
not only his; they swear by the Lord, and by Malcham. See how
respectfully he speaks of the word of God, as one resolved to stick to
it, and in nothing to vary from it, and how slightly of the wealth of
this world, as if gold and silver were nothing to him in comparison with
the favour of God; and yet, at the same time, the searcher of hearts
knew that he loved the wages of unrighteousness. Note, It is an easy
thing for bad men to speak very good words, and with their mouth to make
a show of piety. There is no judging of men by their words. God knows
the heart. 2. His corruptions at the same time strongly inclined him to
go contrary to the command. He seemed to refuse the temptation, [Num
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#018.md). But even then he expressed no
abhorrence of it, as Christ did when he had the kingdoms of the world
offered him (Get thee hence Satan), and as Peter did when Simon Magus
offered him money: Thy money perish with thee. But it appears ([Num
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#019).md) that he had a strong
inclination to accept the proffer; for he would further attend, to know
what God would say to him, hoping that he might alter his mind and give
him leave to go. This was a vile reflection upon God Almighty, as if he
could change his mind, and now at last suffer those to be cursed whom he
had pronounced blessed, and as if he would be brought to allow what he
had already declared to be evil. Surely he thought God altogether such a
one as himself. He had already been told what the will of God was, in
which he ought to have acquiesced, and not to have desired a re-hearing
of that cause which was already so plainly determined. Note, It is a
very great affront to God, and a certain evidence of the dominion of
corruption in the heart, to beg leave to sin.

III\. The permission God gave him to go, [Num
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#020.md). God came to him, probably by an
anger, and told him he might, if he pleased, go with Balak's messengers.
So he gave him up to his own heart's lust. "Since thou hast such a mind
to go, even go, yet know that the journey thou undertakest shall not be
for thy honour; for, though thou hast leave to go, thou shalt not, as
thou hopest, have leave to curse, for the word which I shall say unto
thee, that thou shalt do." Note, God has wicked men in a chain; hitherto
they shall come by his permission, but no further that he does permit
them. Thus he makes the wrath of man to praise him, yet, at the same
time, restrains the remainder of it. It was in anger that God said to
Balaam, "Go with them," and we have reason to think that Balaam himself
so understood it, for we do not find him pleading this allowance when
God reproved him for going. Note, As God sometimes denies the prayers of
his people in love, so sometimes he grants the desires of the wicked in
wrath.

IV\. His setting out in the journey, [Num
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#021.md). God gave him leave to go if the
men called him, but he was so fond of the journey that we do not find he
staid for their calling him, but he himself rose up in the morning, got
every thing ready with all speed, and went with the princes of Moab, who
were proud enough that they had carried their point. The apostle
describes Balaam's sin here to be that he ran greedily into an error for
reward, [Jde 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011.md). The love of money
is the root of all evil.

[Numbers 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 22:22</span></span>

We have here an account of the opposition God gave to Balaam in his
journey towards Moab; probably the princes had gone before, or gone some
other way, and Balaam had pointed out where he would meet them, or where
they should stay for him, for we read nothing of them in this part of
our narrative, only that Balaam, like a person of some quality, was
attended with his two men-honour enough, one would think, for such a
man, he needed not be beholden to Balak for promotion.

I. Here is God's displeasure against Balaam for undertaking this
journey: God's anger was kindled because he went, [Num
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#022.md). Note, 1. The sin of sinners is
not to be thought the less provoking to God because he permits it. We
must not think that, because God does not by his providence restrain men
from sin, therefore he approves of it, or that it is therefore not
hateful to him; he suffers sin, and yet is angry at it. 2. Nothing is
more displeasing to God than malicious designs against his people; he
that touches them touches the apple of his eye.

II\. The way God took to let Balaam know his displeasure against him: An
angel stood in the way for an adversary. Now God fulfilled his promise
to Israel ([Exo 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#022).md), I will be an
enemy to thy enemies. The holy angels are adversaries to sin, and
perhaps are employed more than we are aware of in preventing it,
particularly in opposing those that have any ill designs against God's
church and people, for whom Michael our prince stands up, [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md); [Dan
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021.md). What a comfort is this to all
that wish well to the Israel of God, that he never suffers wicked men to
form an attempt against them, without sending his holy angels forth to
break the attempt and secure his little ones! When the prophet saw the
four horns that scattered Judah, at the same time he saw four carpenters
that were to fray those horns, [Zac
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#018.md), etc. When the enemy comes in
like a flood the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him.
This angel was an adversary to Balaam, because Balaam counted him his
adversary; otherwise those are really our best friends, and we are so to
reckon them, that stop our progress in a sinful way. The angel stood
with his sword drawn ([Num 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#023).md), a
flaming sword, like that in the hands of the cherubim ([Gen
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#024).md), turning every way. Note, The
holy angels are at war with those with whom God is angry, for they are
the ministers of his justice. Observe,

1\. Balaam had notice given him of God's displeasure, by the ass, and
this did not startle him. The ass saw the angel, [Num
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#023.md). How vainly did Balaam boast
that he was a man whose eyes were open, and that he saw the visions of
the Almighty ([Num 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#003.md), [Num
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#004).md), when the ass he rode on saw
more than he did, his eyes being blinded with covetousness and ambition
and dazzled with the rewards of divination! Note, Many have God against
them, and his holy angels, but are not aware of it. The ass knows his
owner, sees his danger, but Balaam does not know, does not consider,
[Isa 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#003.md). Lord, when thy hand is
lifted up, they will not see, [Isa
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#011.md). Let none be puffed up with a
conceit of visions and revelations, when even an ass saw an angel; yet
let those be ashamed of their own sottishness, worse than that of the
beasts that perish, who, when they are told of the sword of God's wrath
drawn against them, while they persist in wicked ways, yet will go on:
the ass understood the law of self-preservation better than so; for, to
save both herself and her senseless rider, (1.) She turned aside out of
the way, [Num 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#023.md). Balaam should
have taken the hint of this, and considered whether he was not out of
the way of his duty; but, instead of this, he beat her into the way
again. Thus those who by wilful sin are running headlong into perdition
are angry at those that would prevent their ruin. (2.) She had not gone
much further before she saw the angel again, and the, to avoid him, ran
up to a wall, and crushed her rider's foot, [Num
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#024.md), [Num
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#025.md). How many ill accidents are we
liable to in travelling upon the road, from which if we are preserved we
must own our obligations to the divine Providence, which by the ministry
of angels keeps us in all our ways, lest we dash our foot against a
stone; but, if we at any time meet with a disaster, it should put us
upon enquiring whether our way be right in the sight of God or no. The
crushing of Balaam's foot, though it was the saving of his life,
provoked him so much that he smote his ass the second time, so angry are
we apt to be at that which, though a present uneasiness, yet is a real
kindness. (3.) Upon the next encounter with the angel, the ass fell down
under Balaam, [Num 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#026.md), [Num
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#027.md). He ought to have considered
that there was certainly something extraordinary in this; for his ass
was not restive, nor did she use to serve him thus: but it is common for
those whose hearts are fully set in them to do evil to push on
violently, and break through all the difficulties which Providence lays
in their way to give check to them and to stop them in their career.
Balaam the third time smote his ass, though she had now done him the
best piece of service that ever she did him, saving him from the sword
of the angel, and by her falling down teaching him to do likewise. (4.)
When all this would not work upon him, God opened the mouth of the ass,
and she spoke to him once and again; and yet neither did this move him:
The Lord opened the mouth of the ass, [Num
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#028.md). This was a great miracle, quite
above the power of nature, and wrought by the power of the God of
nature, who made man's mouth, and taught him to speak, for otherwise
(since we learn to speak purely by imitation, and therefore those that
are born deaf are consequently dumb) the first man would never have
spoken, nor any of his seed. He that made man speak could, when he
pleased, make the ass to speak with man's voice, [Pe2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#016.md). Here Mr. Ainsworth observes that
the devil, when he tempted our first parents to sin, employed a subtle
serpent, but that God, when he would convince Balaam, employed a silly
ass, a creature dull and sottish to a proverb; for Satan corrupts men's
minds by the craftiness of those that lie in wait to deceive, but Christ
has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. By a
dumb ass God rebukes the madness of the prophet, for he will never want
reprovers, but when he pleases can make the stones cry out as witnesses
to him, [Luk 19:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#040.md); [Hab
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#011.md). \[1.\] The ass complained of
Balaam's cruelty ([Num 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#028).md): What
have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me? Note, The righteous
God will not see the meanest and weakest abused; but either they shall
be enabled to speak in their own defence or he will some way or other
speak for them. If God would not suffer a beast to be wronged, much less
a man, a Christian, a child of his own. We cannot open the mouth of the
dumb, as God did here, but we may and must open our mouth for the dumb,
[Pro 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#008.md); [Job
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#013.md). The ass's complaint was just:
What have I done? Note, When we are prompted to smite any with hand or
tongue, we should consider what they have done unto us, and what
provocation they have given us. We hear it not, but thus the whole
creation groans, being burdened, [Rom
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#022.md). It was much that Balaam was not
astonished to hear his ass speak, and put to confusion: but some think
that it was no new thing to him (being a conjurer) to be thus spoken to
by his familiars; others rather think that his brutish head-strong
passion so blinded him that he could not observe or consider the
strangeness of the thing. Nothing besots men worse than unbridled anger.
Balaam in his fury wished he had a sword to kill his ass with, [Num
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#029.md). See his impotency; can he think
by his curses to do mischief to Israel that has it not in his power to
kill his own ass? This he cannot do, yet he fain would; and what would
he get by that, but make himself so much the poorer (as many do), to
gratify his passion and revenge? Such was the madness of this false
prophet. Here bishop Hall observes, It is ill falling into the hands of
those whom the brute-creatures find unmerciful; for a good man regardeth
the life of his beast. \[2.\] The ass reasoned with him, [Num
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#030.md). God enabled not only a dumb
creature to speak, but a dull creature to speak to the purpose. Three
things she argues with him from: - First, His propriety in her: Am not I
thy ass? Note, 1. God has given to man a dominion over the creatures:
they are delivered into his hand to be used, and put under his feet to
be ruled. 2. Even wicked people have a title to the possessions God
gives to them, which they are not to be wronged of. 3. The dominion God
has given us over the creatures is a good reason why we should not abuse
them. We are their lords, and therefore must not be tyrants. Secondly,
Her serviceableness to him: On which thou hast ridden. Note, It is good
for us often to consider how useful the inferior creatures are, and have
been, to us, that we may be thankful to God, and tender of them.
Thirdly, That she was not wont to do so by him, and had never before
crushed his foot, nor fallen down under him; he might therefore conclude
there was something more than ordinary that made her do so now. Note, 1.
The rare occurrence of an offence should moderate our displeasure
against an offender. 2. When the creatures depart from their wonted
obedience to us, we should enquire the cause within ourselves, and be
humbled for our sin.

2\. Balaam at length had notice of God's displeasure by the angel, and
this did startle him. When God opened his eyes he saw the angel ([Num
22:31](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#031).md), and then he himself fell flat
upon his face, in reverence of that glorious messenger, and in fear of
the sword he saw in his hand. God has many ways of breading and bringing
down the hard and unhumbled heart. (1.) The angel reproved him for his
outrageousness ([Num 22:32](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#032.md), [Num
22:33](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#033).md): Wherefore hast thou smitten
thy ass? Whether we consider it or no, it is certain that God will call
us to account for the abuses done to his creatures. Nay, he shows him
how much more reason he had to smite upon his breast, and to condemn
himself, than to fly out thus against his ass ("Thy way is perverse
before me, and then how canst thou expect to prosper?"), and how much
wiser his ass was than himself, and how much beholden he was to her that
she turned aside; it was for his safety, and not for her own, for had
she gone on he had been slain, and she had been saved alive. Note, When
our eyes are opened we shall see what danger we are in in a sinful way,
and how much it was for our advantage to be crossed in it, and what
fools we were to quarrel with our crosses which helped to save our
lives. (2.) Balaam then seemed to relent ([Num
22:34](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#034).md): "I have sinned, sinned in
undertaking this journey, sinned in pushing on so violently;" but he
excused it with this, that he saw not the angel; yet, now that he did
see him, he was willing to go back again. That which was displeasing to
God was not so much his going as his going with a malicious design
against Israel, and a secret hope that notwithstanding the proviso with
which his permission was clogged he might prevail to curse them, and so
gratify Balak, and get preferment under him. It does not appear that he
was sensible of this wickedness of his heart, or willing to own it, but,
when he finds he cannot go forward, he will be content (since there is
no remedy) to go back. Here is no sign that his heart is turned, but, if
his hands are tied, he cannot help it. Thus many leave their sins only
because their sins have left them. There seems to be a reformation of
the life, but what will this avail if there be no renovation of the
heart? (3.) The angel however continued his permission: "Go with the
men, [Num 22:35](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#035.md). Go, if thou hast a
mind to be made a fool of, and to be shamed before Balak, and all the
princes of Moab. Go, only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that
thou shalt speak, whether thou wilt or no," for this seems not to be a
precept, but a prediction of the event, that he should not only not be
able to curse Israel, but should be forced to bless them, which would be
more for the glory of God and his own confusion than if he had turned
back. Thus God gave him fair warning, but he would not take it; he went
with the princes of Balak. For the iniquity of Balaam's covetousness God
was wroth, and smote him, but he went on frowardly, [Isa
57:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#017.md).

We have here the meeting between Balak and Balaam, confederate enemies
to God's Israel; but here they seem to differ in their expectations of
the success. 1. Balak speaks of it with confidence, not doubting but to
gain his point now that Balaam had come. In expectation of this, he went
out to meet him, even to the utmost border of his country ([Num
22:36](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#036).md), partly to gratify his own
impatient desire to see one he had such great expectations from, and
partly to do honour to Balaam, and so to engage him with his utmost
power to serve him. See what respect heathen princes paid to those that
had but the name and face of prophets, and pretended to have any
interest in heaven; and how welcome one was that came with his mouth
full of curses. What a shame is it then that the ambassadors of Christ
are so little respected by most, so much despised by some, and that
those are so coldly entertained who bring tidings of peace and a
blessing! Balak has now nothing to complain of but that Balaam did not
come sooner, [Num 22:37](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#037.md). And he thinks
that he should have considered the importunity Balak had used, Did I not
earnestly send to thee? (and the importunity of people inferior to kings
has prevailed with many against their inclinations), and that he should
also have considered Balak's intentions concerning him: Am not I able to
promote thee to honour? Balak, as king, was in his own kingdom the
fountain of honour, and Balaam should have his choice of all the
preferments that were in his gift; he therefore thinks himself affronted
by Balaam's delays, which looked as if he thought the honours he
prepared not worthy his acceptance. Note, Promotion to honour is a very
tempting bait to many people; and it were well if we would be drawn into
the service of God by the honour he sets before us. Why do we delay to
come unto him? Is not he able to promote us to honour? 2. Balaam speaks
doubtfully of the issue, and bids Balak not depend to much upon him
([Num 22:38](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#038).md): "Have I now any power at
all to say any thing? I have come, but what the nearer am I? Gladly
would I curse Israel; but I must not, I cannot, God will not suffer me."
He seems to speak with vexation at the hook in his nose and the bridle
in his jaws, such as Sennacherib was tied up with, [Isa
37:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#029.md). 3. They address themselves with
all speed to the business. Balaam is nobly entertained over night, a
sacrifice of thanksgiving is offered to the gods of Moab, for the safe
arrival of this welcome guest, and his is treated with a feast upon the
sacrifice, [Num 22:40](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#040.md). And the next
morning, that no time might be lost, Balak takes Balaam in his chariot
to the high places of his kingdom, not only because their holiness (such
as it was), he thought, might give some advantage to his divinations,
but their height might give him a convenient prospect of the camp of
Israel, which was to be the butt or mark at which he must shoot his
envenomed arrows. And now Balaam is really as solicitous to please Balak
as ever he had pretended to be to please God. See what need we have to
pray every day, Our Father in heaven, lead us not into temptation.
