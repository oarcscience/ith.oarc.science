### [Hosea Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md)

[Hosea](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hos 11:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have, I. The great goodness of God towards his people
Israel, and the great things he had done for them ([Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md), [Hos
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#003.md), [Hos
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#004).md). II. Their ungrateful conduct
towards him, notwithstanding his favours towards them ([Hos
11:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#002.md), [Hos
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007.md), [Hos
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#012).md). III. Threatenings of wrath
against them for their ingratitude and treachery ([Hos
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#005.md), [Hos
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#006).md). IV. Mercy remembered in the
midst of wrath ([Hos 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008.md), [Hos
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009).md). V. Promises of what God would
yet do for them ([Hos 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#010.md), [Hos
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#011).md). VI. An honourable character
given of Judah ([Hos 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#012).md).

[Hosea 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 11:1</span></span>

Here we find,

I. God very gracious to Israel. They were a people for whom he had done
more than for any people under heaven, and to whom he had given more,
which they are here, I will not say upbraided with (for God gives, and
upbraids not), but put in mind of, as an aggravation of their sin and an
encouragement to repentance. 1. He had a kindness for them when they
were young ([Hos 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001).md): When Israel
was a child then I loved him; when they first began to multiply into a
nation in Egypt God then set his love upon them, and chose them because
he loved them, because he would love them, [Deu
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#007.md), [Deu
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#008.md). When they were weak and helpless
as children, foolish and froward as children, when they were outcasts,
and children exposed, then God loved them; he pitied them, and testified
his goodwill to them; he bore them as the nurse does the sucking child,
nourished them, and suffered their manners. Note, Those that have grown
up, nay, those that have grown old, ought often to reflect upon the
goodness of God to them in their childhood. 2. He delivered them out of
the house of bondage: I called my son out of Egypt, because a son,
because a beloved son. When God demanded Israel's discharge from Pharaoh
he called them his son, his first-born. Note, Those whom God loves he
calls out of the bondage of sin and Satan into the glorious liberty of
his children. These words are said to have been fulfilled in Christ,
when, upon the death of Herod, he and his parents were called out of
Egypt ([Mat 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#015).md), so that the words
have a double aspect, speaking historically of the calling of Israel out
of Egypt and prophetically of the bringing of Christ thence; and the
former was a type of the latter, and a pledge and earnest of the many
and great favours God had in reserve for that people, especially the
sending of his Son into the world, and the bringing him again into the
land of Israel when they had unkindly driven him out, and he might
justly never have returned. The calling of Christ out of Egypt was a
figure of the calling of all that are his, through him, out of spiritual
slavery. 3. He gave them a good education, took care of them, took pains
with them, not only as a father or tutor, but, such is the condescension
of divine grace, as a mother or nurse ([Hos
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#003).md): I taught Ephraim also to go, as
a child in leading-strings is taught. When they were in the wilderness
God led them by the pillar of cloud and fire, showed them the way in
which they should go, and bore them up, taking them by the arms. He
taught them to go in the way of his commandments, by the institutions of
the ceremonial law, which were as tutors and governors to that people
under age. He took them by the arms, to guide them, that they might not
stray, and to hold them up, that they might not stumble and fall. God's
spiritual Israel are thus supported. Thou has holden me by my right
hand, [Psa 73:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#023.md). 4. When any thing
was amiss with them, or they were ever so little out of order, he was
their physician: "I healed them; I not only took a tender care of them
(a friend may do that), but wrought an effectual cure: it is a God only
that can do that. I am the Lord that healeth thee ([Exo
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#026).md), that redresseth all thy
grievances." 5. He brought them into his service by mild and gentle
methods ([Hos 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#004).md): I drew them with
cords of a man, with bands of love. Note, It is God's work to draw poor
souls to himself; and none can come to him except he draw them, [Joh
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044). He draws, (1..md) With the cords of
a man, with such cords as men draw with that have a principle of
humanity, or such cords as men are drawn with; he dealt with them as
men, in an equitable rational way, in an easy gentle way, with the cords
of Adam. He dealt with them as with Adam in innocency, bringing them at
once into a paradise, and into covenant with himself. (2.) With bands of
love, or cartropes of love. This word signifies stronger cords than the
former. He did not drive them by force into his service, whether they
would or no, nor rule them with rigour, nor detain them by violence, but
his attractives were all loving and endearing, all sweet and gentle,
that he might overcome them with kindness. Moses, whom he made their
guide, was the meekest man in the world. Kindnesses among men we
commonly call obligations, or bonds, bonds of love. Thus God draws with
the savour of his good ointments ([Sol
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004).md), draws with lovingkindness, [Jer
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#003.md). Thus God deals with us, and we
must deal in like manner with those that are under our instruction and
government, deal rationally and mildly with them. 6. He eased them of
the burdens they had been long groaning under: I was to them as those
that take off the yoke on their jaws, alluding to the care of the good
husbandman, who is merciful to his beast, and will not tire him with
hard and constant labour. Probably, in those times, the yoke on the neck
of the oxen was fastened with some bridle, or headstall, over the jaws,
which muzzled the mouth of the ox. Israel in Egypt were thus restrained
from the enjoyments of their comforts and constrained to hard labour;
but God eased them, removed their shoulder from the burden, [Psa
81:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#006.md). Note, Liberty is a great mercy,
especially out of bondage. 7. He supplied them with food convenient. In
Egypt they fared hard, but, when God brought them out, he laid meat unto
them, as the husbandman, when he has unyoked his cattle, fodders them.
God rained manna about their camp, bread from heaven, angels' food;
other creatures seek their meat, but God laid meat to his own people, as
we do to our children, was himself their caterer and carver, anticipated
them with the blessings of goodness.

II\. Here is Israel very ungrateful to God.

1\. They were deaf and disobedient to his voice. He spoke to them by his
messengers, Moses and his other prophets, called them from their sins,
called them to himself, to their work and duty; but as they called them
so they went from them; they rebelled in those particular instances
wherein they were admonished; the more pressing and importunate the
prophets were with them, to persuade them to that which was good, the
more refractory they were, and the more resolute in their evil ways,
disobeying for disobedience-sake. This foolishness is bound in the
hearts of children, who, as soon as they are taught to go, will go from
those that call them.

2\. They were fond of idols, and worshipped them: They sacrificed to
Baalim, first one Baal and then another, and burnt incense to graven
images, though they were called to by the prophets of the Lord again and
again not to do this abominable thing which he hated. Idolatry was the
sin which from the beginning, and all along, had most easily beset them.

3\. They were regardless of God, and of his favours to them: They knew
not that I healed them. They looked only at Moses and Aaron, the
instruments of their relief, and, when any thing was amiss, quarrelled
with them, but looked not through them to God who employed them. Or,
When God corrected them, and kept them under a severe discipline, they
understood not that it was for their good, and that God thereby healed
them, and it was necessary for the perfecting of their cure, else they
would have been better reconciled to the methods God took. Note,
Ignorance is at the bottom of ingratitude, [Hos
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#008.md).

4\. They were strongly inclined to apostasy. This is the blackest
article in the charge ([Hos 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007).md): My
people are bent to backsliding from me. Every word here is aggravating.
(1.) They backslide. There is no hold of them, no stedfastness in them;
they seem to come forward, towards God, but they quickly slide back
again, and are as a deceitful bow. (2.) They backslide from me, from
God, the chief good, the fountain of life and living waters, from their
God who never turned from them, nor war as a wilderness to them. (3.)
They are bent to backslide; they are ready to sin; there is in their
natures a propensity to that which is evil; at the best they hang in
suspense between God and the world, so that a little thing serves to
draw them the wrong way; they are forward to close with every
temptation. It also intimates that they are resolute in sin; their
hearts are fully set in them to do evil the bias is strong that way; and
they persist in their backslidings, whatever is said or done to stop
them; and yet, (4.) "They are, in profession, my people. They are called
by my name, and profess relation to me; they are mine, whom I have done
much for and expect much from, whom I have nourished and brought up, as
children, and yet they backslide from me." Note, In our repentance we
ought to lament not only our backslidings, but our bent to backslide,
not only our actual transgressions, but our original corruption, the sin
that dwells in us, the carnal mind.

5\. They were strangely averse to repentance and reformation. Here are
two expressions of their obstinacy: - (1.) They refused to return, [Hos
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#005.md). So much were they bent to
backslide that, though they could not but find, upon trial, the folly of
their backslidings, and that when they forsook God they changed for the
worse, yet they went on frowardly. I have loved strangers, and after
them I will go. They were commanded to return, were courted and
entreated to return, were promised that if they would they should be
kindly received, but they refused. (2.) Though they called them to the
Most High. God's prophets and ministers called them to return to the God
from whom they had revolted, to the most high God, from whom they had
sunk into this wretched degeneracy; they called them from the worship of
the idols, which were so much below them, and the worship of which was
therefore their disparagement, to the true God, who was so much above
them, and the worship of whom was therefore their preferment; they
called them from this earth to high and heavenly things; but they called
in vain. None at all would exalt him. Though he is the most high God
they would not acknowledge him to be so, would do nothing to honour him
nor give him the glory due to his name. Or, They would not exalt
themselves, would not rise out of that state of apostasy and misery into
which they had precipitated themselves; but there they contentedly lay
still, would not lift up their heads nor lift up their souls. Note,
God's faithful ministers have taken a great deal of pains, to no
purpose, with backsliding children, have called them to the Most High;
but none would stir, none at all would exalt him.

III\. Here is God very angry, and justly so, with Israel; see what are
the tokens of God's displeasure with which they are here threatened. 1.
God, who brought them out of Egypt, to take them for a people to
himself, since they would not be faithful to him, shall bring them into
a worse condition than he at first found them in ([Hos
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#005).md): "He shall not return into the
land of Egypt, though that was a house of bondage grievous enough; but
he shall go into a harder service, for the Assyrian shall be his king,
who will use him worse than ever Pharaoh did." They shall not return
into Egypt, which lies near, where they may hear often from their own
country, and whence they may hope shortly to return to it again; but
they shall be carried into Assyria, which lies much more remote, and
where they shall be cut off from all correspondence with their own land
and from all hopes of returning to it, and justly, because they refused
to return. Note, Those that will not return to the duties they have left
cannot expect to return to the comforts they have lost. 2. God, who gave
them Canaan, that good land, and a very safe and comfortable settlement
in it, shall bring his judgments upon them there, which shall make their
habitation unsafe and uncomfortable ([Hos
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#006).md): The sword shall come upon them,
the sword of war, the sword of a foreign enemy, prevailing against them
and triumphing over them. (1.) This judgment shall spread far. The sword
shall fasten upon their cities, those nests of people and store-houses
of wealth; it shall likewise reach to their branches, the country
villages (so some), the citizens themselves (so others), or the bars (so
the word signifies) and gates of their city, or all the branches of
their revenue and wealth, or their children, the branches of their
families. (2.) It shall last long: It shall abide on their cities. David
thought three months flying before his enemies was the only judgment of
the three that was to be excepted against; but this sword shall abide
much longer than three months on the cities of Israel. They continued
their rebellions against God, and therefore God continued his judgments
on them. (3.) It shall make a full end: It shall consume their branches,
and devour them, and lay all waste, and this because of their own
counsels, that is, because they would have their own projects, which God
therefore, in a way of righteous judgment, gave them up to. Note, The
confusion of sinners is owing to their contrivance. God's counsels would
have saved them, but their own counsels ruined them.

[Hosea 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 11:8</span></span>

In these verses we have,

I. God's wonderful backwardness to destroy Israel ([Hos
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008.md), [Hos
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009).md): How shall I give thee up? Here
observe,

1\. God's gracious debate within himself concerning Israel's case, a
debate between justice and mercy, in which victory plainly inclines to
mercy's side. Be astonished, O heavens! at this, and wonder, O earth! at
the glory of God's goodness. Not that there are any such struggles in
God as there are in us, or that he is ever fluctuating or unresolved;
no, he is in one mind, and knows it; but they are expressions after the
manner of men, designed to show what severity the sin of Israel had
deserved, and yet how divine grace would be glorified in sparing them
notwithstanding. The connexion of this with what goes before is very
surprising; it was said of Israel ([Hos
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007).md) that they were bent to backslide
from God, that though they were called to him they would not exalt him,
upon which, one would think, it should have followed, "Now I am
determined to destroy them, and never show them mercy any more." No,
such is the sovereignty of mercy, such the freeness, the fulness, of
divine grace, that it follows immediately, How shall I give thee up? See
here, (1.) The proposals that justice makes concerning Israel, the
suggestion of which is here implied. Let Ephraim be given up, as an
incorrigible son is given up to be disinherited, as an incurable patient
is given over by his physician. Let him be given up to ruin. Let Israel
be delivered into the enemy's hand, as a lamb to the lion to be torn in
pieces; let them be made as Admah and set as Zeboim, the two cities that
with Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed by fire and brimstone rained from
heaven upon them; let them be utterly and irreparably ruined, and be
made as like these cities in desolation as they have been in sin. Let
that curse which is written in the law be executed upon them, that the
whole land shall be brimstone and salt, like the overthrow of Sodom and
Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboim, [Deu
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023.md). Ephraim and Israel deserve to
be thus abandoned, and God will do them no wrong if he deal thus with
them. (2.) The opposition that mercy makes to these proposals: How shall
I do it? As the tender father reasons with himself, "How can I cast off
my untoward son? for he is my son, though he be untoward; how can I find
in my heart to do it?" Thus, "Ephraim has been a dear son, a pleasant
child: How can I do it? He is ripe for ruin; judgments stand ready to
seize him; there wants nothing but giving him up, but I cannot do it.
They have been a people near unto me; there are yet some good among
them; theirs are the children of the covenant; if they be ruined, the
enemy will triumph; it may be they will yet repent and reform; and
therefore how can I do it?" Note, The God of heaven is slow to anger,
and is especially loth to abandon a people to utter ruin that have been
in special relation to him. See how mercy works upon the mention of
those severe proceedings: My heart is turned within me, as we say, Our
heart fails us, when we come to do a thing that is against the grain
with us. God speaks as if he were conscious to himself of a strange
striving of affections in compassion to Israel: as [Lam
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#020.md), My bowels are troubled; my heart
is turned within me. As it follows here, My repentings are kindled
together. His bowels yearned towards them, and his soul was grieved for
their sin and misery, [Jdg 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#016.md).
Compare [Jer 31:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#020.md). Since I spoke
against him my bowels are troubled for him. When God was to give up his
Son to be a sacrifice for sin, and a Saviour for sinners, he did not
say, How shall I give him up? No, he spared not his own Son; it pleased
the Lord to bruise him; and therefore God spared not him, that he might
spare us. But this is only the language of the day of his patience; when
men have sinned that away, and the great day of his wrath comes, then no
difficulty is made of it; nay, I will laugh at their calamity.

2\. His gracious determination of this debate. After a long contest
mercy in the issue rejoices against judgment, has the last word, and
carries the day, [Hos 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009.md). It is
decreed that the reprieve shall be lengthened out yet longer, and I will
not now execute the fierceness of my anger, though I am angry; though
they shall not go altogether unpunished, yet he will mitigate the
sentence and abate the rigour of it. He will show himself to be justly
angry, but not implacably so; they shall be corrected, but not consumed.
I will not return to destroy Ephraim; the judgments that have been
inflicted shall not be repeated, shall not go so deep as they have
deserved. He will not return to destroy, as soldiers, when they have
pillaged a town once, return a second time, to take more, as when what
the palmer-worm has left the locust has eaten. It is added, in the close
of the verse, "I will not enter into the city, into Samaria, or any
other of their cities; I will not enter into them as an enemy, utterly
to destroy them, and lay them waste, as I did the cities of Admah and
Zeboim."

3\. The ground and reason of this determination: For I am God and not
man, the Holy One of Israel. To encourage them, to hope that they shall
find mercy, consider, (1.) What he is in himself: He is God, and not
man, as in other things, so in pardoning sin and sparing sinners. If
they had offended a man like themselves, he would not, he could not have
borne it; his passion would have overpowered his compassion, and he
would have executed the fierceness of his anger; but I am God, and not
man. He is Lord of his anger, whereas men's anger commonly lords it over
them. If an earthly prince were in such a strait between justice and
mercy, he would be at a loss how to compromise the matter between them;
but he who is God, and not man, knows how to find out an expedient to
secure the honour of his justice and yet advance the honour of his
mercy. Man's compassions are nothing in comparison with the tender
mercies of our God, whose thoughts and ways, in receiving returning
sinners, are as much above ours as heaven is above the earth, [Isa
55:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#009.md). Note, It is a great
encouragement to our hope in God's mercies to remember that he is God,
and not man. He is the Holy One. One would think this were a reason why
he should reject such a provoking people. No; God knows how to spare and
pardon poor sinners, not only without any reproach to his holiness, but
very much to the honour of it, as he is faithful and just to forgive us
our sins, and therein declares his righteousness, now Christ has
purchased the pardon and he has promised it. (2.) What he is to them; he
is the Holy One in the midst of thee; his holiness is engaged for the
good of his church, and even in this corrupt and degenerate land and age
there were some that gave thanks at the remembrance of his holiness, and
he required of them all to be holy as he is, [Lev
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#002.md). As long as we have the Holy One
in the midst of us we are safe and well; but woe to us when he leaves
us! Note, Those who submit to the influence may take the comfort of
God's holiness.

II\. Here is his wonderful forwardness to do good for Israel, which
appears in this, that he will qualify them to receive the good he
designs for them ([Hos 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#010.md), [Hos
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#011).md): They shall walk after the
Lord. This respects the same favour with that ([Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005).md), They shall return, and seek the
Lord their God; it is spoken of the ten tribes, and had its
accomplishment, in part, in the return of some of them with those of the
two tribes in Ezra's time; but it had its more full accomplishment in
God's spiritual Israel, the gospel-church, brought together and
incorporated by the gospel of Christ. The ancient Jews referred it to
the time of the Messiah; the learned Dr. Pocock looks upon it as a
prophecy of Christ's coming to preach the gospel to the dispersed
children of Israel, the children of God that were scattered abroad. And
then observe, 1. How they were to be called and brought together: The
Lord shall roar like a lion. The word of the Lord (so says the Chaldee)
shall be as a lion that roars. Christ is called the lion of the tribe of
Judah, and his gospel, in the beginning of it, was the voice of one
crying in the wilderness. When Christ cried with a loud voice it was as
when a lion roared, [Rev 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#003.md). The
voice of the gospel was heard afar, as the roaring of a lion, and it was
a mighty voice. See [Joe 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#016.md). 2. What
impression this call should make upon them, such an impression as the
roaring of a lion makes upon all the beasts of the forest: When he shall
roar then the children shall tremble. See [Amo
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#008.md), The lion has roared; the Lord God
has spoken; and then who will not fear? When those whose hearts the
gospel reached trembled, and were astonished, and cried out, What shall
we do? - when they were by it put upon working out their salvation, and
worshipping God with fear and trembling, then this promise was
fulfilled. The children shall tremble from the west. The dispersed Jews
were carried eastward, to Assyria and Babylon, and those that returned
came from the east; therefore this seems to have reference to the
calling of the Gentiles that lay westward from Canaan, for that way
especially the gospel spread. They shall tremble; they shall move and
come with trembling, with care and haste, from the west, from the
nations that lay that way, to the mountain of the Lord ([Isa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003).md), to the gospel-Jerusalem, upon
hearing the alarm of the gospel. The apostle speaks of mighty signs and
wonders that were wrought by the preaching of the gospel from Jerusalem
round about to Illyricum, [Rom 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#019.md).
Then the children trembled from the west. And, whereas Israel after the
flesh was dispersed in Egypt and Assyria, it is promised that they shall
be effectually summoned thence ([Hos
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#011).md): They shall tremble; they shall
come trembling, and with all haste, as a bird upon the wing, out of
Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; a dove is noted for
swift and constant flight, especially when she flies to her windows,
which the flocking of Jews and Gentiles to the church is here compared
to, as it is [Isa 60:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#008.md). Wherever those
are that belong to the election of grace - east, west, north, or south -
they shall hear the joyful sound, and be wrought upon by it; those of
Egypt and Assyria shall come together; those that lay most remote from
each other shall meet in Christ, and be incorporated in the church. Of
the uniting of Egypt and Assyria, it was prophesied, [Isa
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#023.md). 3. What effect these
impressions should have upon them. Being moved with fear, they shall
flee to the ark: They shall walk after the Lord, after the service of
the Lord (so the Chaldee); they shall take the Lord Christ for their
leader and commander; they shall enlist themselves under him as the
captain of their salvation, and give up themselves to the direction of
the Spirit as their guide by the word; they shall leave all to follow
Christ, as becomes disciples. Note, Our holy trembling at the word of
Christ will draw us to him, not drive us from him. When he roars like a
lion the slaves tremble and flee from him, the children tremble and flee
to him. 4. What entertainment they shall meet with at their return ([Hos
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#011).md): I will place them in their
houses (all those that come at the gospel-call shall have a place and a
name in the gospel-church, in the particular churches which are their
houses, to which they pertain; they shall dwell in God, and be at home
in him, both easy and safe, as a man in his own house; they shall have
mansions, for there are many in our Father's house), in his tabernacle
on earth and his temple in heaven, in everlasting habitations, which may
be called their houses, for they are the lot they shall stand in at the
end of the days.

III\. Here is a sad complaint of the treachery of Ephraim and Israel,
which may be an intimation that it is not Israel after the flesh, but
the spiritual Israel, to whom the foregoing promises belong, for as for
this Ephraim, this Israel, they compass God about with lies and deceit;
all their services of him, when they pretended to compass his altar,
were feigned and hypocritical; when they surrounded him with their
prayers and praises, every one having a petition to present to him, they
lied to him with their mouth and flattered him with their tongue; their
pretensions were so fair, and yet their intentions so foul, that they
would, if possible, have imposed upon God himself. Their professions and
promises were all a cheat, and yet with these they thought to compass
God about, to enclose him as it were, to keep him among them, and
prevent his leaving them.

IV\. Here is a pleasant commendation of the integrity of the two tribes,
which they held fast, and this comes in as an aggravation of the
perfidiousness of the ten tribes, and a reason why God had that mercy in
store for Judah which he had not for Israel ([Hos
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#006.md), [Hos
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#007).md), for Judah yet rules with God and
is faithful with the saints, or with the Most Holy. 1. Judah rules with
God, that is, he serves God, and the service of God is not only true
liberty and freedom, but it is dignity and dominion. Judah rules, that
is, the princes and governors of Judah rule with God; they use their
power for him, for his honour, and the support of his interest. Those
rule with God that rule in the fear of God ([Sa2
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#003).md), and it is their honour to do
so, and their praise shall be of God, as Judah's here is. Judah is
Israel - a prince with God. 2. He is faithful with the holy God, keeps
close to his worship and to his saints, with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
whose steps they faithfully tread in. They walk in the way of good men;
and those that do so rule with God, they have a mighty interest in
Heaven. Judah yet does thus, which intimates that the time would come
when Judah also would revolt and degenerate. Note, When we see how many
there are that compass God about with lies and deceit it may be a
comfort to us to think that God has his remnant that cleave to him with
purpose of heart, and are faithful to his saints; and for those who are
thus faithful unto death is reserved a crown of life, when hypocrites
and all liars shall have their portion without.
