### [Proverbs Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">pro 30:0</span></span>

This and the following chapter are an appendix to Solomon's proverbs;
but they are both expressly called prophecies in the first verses of
both, by which it appears that the penmen of them, whoever they were,
were divinely inspired. This chapter was penned by one that bears the
name of "Agur Ben Jakeh." What tribe he was of, or when he lived, we are
not told; what he wrote, being indited by the Holy Ghost, is here kept
upon record. We have here, I. His confession of faith ([Pro
30:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001).md). II. His prayer ([Pro
30:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#007).md). III. A caution against
wronging servants ([Pro 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#010).md). IV.
Four wicked generations ([Pro
30:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#011).md). V. Four things insatiable
([Pro 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#015.md), [Pro
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#016).md), to which is added fair warning
to undutiful children ([Pro 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#017).md).
VI. Four things unsearchable ([Pro
30:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#018).md). VII. Four things
intolerable ([Pro 30:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#021).md). VIII.
Four things little and wise ([Pro
30:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#024).md). IX. Four things stately
([Pro 30:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#029) to the end.md).

[Proverbs 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 30:1</span></span>

Some make Agur to be not the name of this author, but his character; he
was a collector (so it signifies), a gatherer, one that did not compose
things himself, but collected the wise sayings and observations of
others, made abstracts of the writings of others, which some think is
the reason why he says ([Pro 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#003).md), "I
have not learned wisdom myself, but have been a scribe, or amanuensis,
to other wise and learned men." Note, We must not bury our talent,
though it be but one, but, as we have received the gift, so minister the
same, if it be but to collect what others have written. But we rather
suppose it to be his name, which, no doubt, was well known then, though
not mentioned elsewhere in scripture. Ithiel and Ucal are mentioned,
either, 1. As the names of his pupils, whom he instructed, or who
consulted him as an oracle, having a great opinion of his wisdom and
goodness. Probably they wrote from him what he dictated, as Baruch wrote
from the mouth of Jeremiah, and by their means it was preserved, as they
were ready to attest it to be his, for it was spoken to them; they were
two witnesses of it. Or, 2. As the subject of his discourse. Ithiel
signifies God with me, the application of Immanuel, God with us. The
word calls him God with us; faith appropriates this, and calls him "God
with me, who loved me, and gave himself for me, and into union and
communion with whom I am admitted." Ucal signifies the Mighty One, for
it is upon one that is mighty that help is laid for us. Many good
interpreters therefore apply this to the Messiah, for to him all the
prophecies bear witness, and why not this then? It is what Agur spoke
concerning Ithiel, even concerning Ithiel (that is the name on which the
stress is laid) with us, [Isa 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md).

Three things the prophet here aims at: -

I. To abase himself. Before he makes confession of his faith he makes
confession of his folly and the weakness and deficiency of reason, which
make it so necessary that we be guided and governed by faith. Before he
speaks concerning the Saviour he speaks of himself as needing a Saviour,
and as nothing without him; we must go out of ourselves before we go
into Jesus Christ. 1. He speaks of himself as wanting a righteousness,
and having done foolishly, very foolishly. When he reflects upon himself
he owns, Surely I am more brutish than any man. Every man has become
brutish, [Jer 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#014.md). But he that knows
his own heart knows so much more evil of himself than he does of any
other that he cries out, "Surely I cannot but think that I am more
brutish than any man; surely no man has such a corrupt deceitful heart
as I have. I have acted as one that has not the understanding of Adam,
as one that is wretchedly degenerated from the knowledge and
righteousness in which man was at first created; nay, I have not the
common sense and reason of a man, else I should not have done as I have
done." Agur, when he was applied to by others as wiser than most,
acknowledged himself more foolish than any. Whatever high opinion others
may have of us, it becomes us to have low thoughts of ourselves. 2. He
speaks of himself as wanting a revelation to guide him in the ways of
truth and wisdom. He owns ([Pro 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#003).md)
"I neither learned wisdom by any power of my own (the depths of it
cannot be fathomed by my line and plummet) nor know I the knowledge of
the holy ones, the angels, our first parents in innocency, nor of the
holy things of God; I can get no insight into them, nor make any
judgment of them, further than God is pleased to make them known to me."
The natural man, the natural powers, perceive not, nay, they receive
not, the things of the Spirit of God. Some suppose Agur to be asked, as
Apollo's oracle was of old, Who was the wisest man? The answer is, He
that is sensible of his own ignorance, especially in divine things. Hoc
tantum scio, me nihil scire - All that I know is that I know nothing.

II\. To advance Jesus Christ, and the Father in him ([Pro
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#004).md): Who ascended up into heaven,
etc. 1. Some understand this of God and of his works, which are both
incomparable and unsearchable. He challenges all mankind to give an
account of the heavens above, of the winds, the waters, the earth: "Who
can pretend to have ascended up to heaven, to take a view of the orbs
above, and then to have descended, to give us a description of them? Who
can pretend to have had the command of the winds, to have grasped them
in his hand and managed them, as God does, or to have bound the waves of
the sea with a swaddling band, as God has done? Who has established the
ends of the earth, or can describe the strength of its foundations or
the extent of its limits? Tell me what is the man's name who can
undertake to vie with God or to be of his cabinet-council, or, if he be
dead, what is his name to whom he has bequeathed this great secret." 2.
Others refer it to Christ, to Ithiel and Ucal, the Son of God, for it is
the Son's name, as well as the Father's, that is here enquired after,
and a challenge given to any to vie with him. We must now exalt Christ
as one revealed; they then magnified him as one concealed, as one they
had heard something of but had very dark and defective ideas of. We have
heard the fame of him with our ears, but cannot describe him ([Job
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#022).md); certainly it is God that has
gathered the wind in his fists and bound the waters as in a garment; but
what is his name? It is, I am that I am ([Exo
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#014).md), a name to be adored, not to be
understood. What is his Son's name, by whom he does all these things?
The Old Testament saints expected the Messiah to be the Son of the
Blessed, and he is here spoken of as a person distinct from the Father,
but his name as yet secret. Note, The great Redeemer, in the glories of
his providence and grace, can neither be paralleled nor found out to
perfection. (1.) The glories of the kingdom of his grace are
unsearchable and unparalleled; for who besides has ascended into heaven
and descended? Who besides is perfectly acquainted with both worlds, and
has himself a free correspondence with both, and is therefore fit to
settle a correspondence between them, as Mediator, as Jacob's ladder? He
was in heaven in the Father's bosom ([Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md), [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018).md); thence he descended to take our
nature upon him; and never was there such condescension. In that nature
he again ascended ([Eph 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#009).md), to
receive the promised glories of his exalted state; and who besides has
done this? [Rom 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#006). (2..md) The glories
of the kingdom of his providence are likewise unsearchable and
unparalleled. The same that reconciles heaven and earth was the Creator
of both and governs and disposes of all. His government of the three
lower elements of air, water, and earth, is here particularized. \[1.\]
The motions of the air are of his directing. Satan pretends to be the
prince of the power of the air, but even there Christ has all power; he
rebuked the winds and they obeyed him. \[2.\] The bounds of the water
are of his appointing: He binds the waters as in a garment; hitherto
they shall come, and no further, [Job
38:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#009.md). \[3.\] The foundations of the
earth are of his establishing. He founded it at first; he upholds it
still. If Christ had not interposed, the foundations of the earth would
have sunk under the load of the curse upon the ground, for man's sin.
Who and what is the mighty He that does all this? We cannot find out
God, nor the Son of God, unto perfection. Oh the depth of that
knowledge!

III\. To assure us of the truth of the word of God, and to recommend it
to us, [Pro 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#005.md), [Pro
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#006.md). Agur's pupils expect to be
instructed by him in the things of God. "Alas!" says he, "I cannot
undertake to instruct you; go to the word of God; see what he has there
revealed of himself, and of his mind and will; you need know no more
than what that will teach you, and that you may rely upon as sure and
sufficient. Every word of God is pure; there is not the least mixture of
falsehood and corruption in it." The words of men are to be heard and
read with jealousy and with allowance, but there is not the least ground
to suspect any deficiency in the word of God; it is as silver purified
seven times ([Psa 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#006).md), without the
least dross or alloy. Thy word is very pure, [Psa
119:140](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#140.md). 1. It is sure, and therefore
we must trust to it and venture our souls upon it. God in his word, God
in his promise, is a shield, a sure protection, to all those that put
themselves under his protection and put their trust in him. The word of
God, applied by faith, will make us easy in the midst of the greatest
dangers, [Psa 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001.md), [Psa
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#002.md). 2. It is sufficient, and
therefore we must not add to it ([Pro
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#006).md): Add thou not unto his words,
because they are pure and perfect. This forbids the advancing of any
thing, not only in contradiction to the word of God, but in competition
with it; though it be under the plausible pretence of explaining it,
yet, if it pretend to be of equal authority with it, it is adding to his
words, which is not only a reproach to them as insufficient, but opens a
door to all manner of errors and corruptions; for, that one absurdity
being granted, that the word of any man, or company of men, is to be
received with the same faith and veneration as the word of God, a
thousand follow. We must be content with what God has thought fit to
make known to us of his mind, and not covet to be wise above what is
written; for, (1.) God will resent it as a heinous affront: "He will
reprove thee, will reckon with thee as a traitor against his crown and
dignity, and lay thee under the heavy doom of those that add to his
words, or diminish from them," [Deu
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#002.md); [Deu
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#032). (2..md) We shall run ourselves
into endless mistakes: "Thou wilt be found a liar, a corrupter of the
word of truth, a broacher of heresies, and guilty of the worst of
forgeries, counterfeiting the broad seal of heaven, and pretending a
divine mission and inspiration, when it is all a cheat. Men may be thus
deceived, but God is not mocked."

[Proverbs 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 30:7</span></span>

After Agur's confession and creed, here follows his litany, where we may
observe,

I. The preface to his prayer: Two things have I required (that is,
requested) of thee, O God! Before we go to pray it is good to consider
what we need, and what the things are which we have to ask of God. -
What does our case require? What do our hearts desire? What would we
that God should do for us? - that we may not have to seek for our
petition and request when we should be presenting it. He begs, Deny me
not before I die. In praying, we should think of dying, and pray
accordingly. "Lord, give me pardon, and peace, and grace, before I die,
before I go hence and be no more; for, if I be not renewed and
sanctified before I die, the work will not be done after; if I do not
prevail in prayer before I die, prayers afterwards will not prevail, no,
not Lord, Lord. There is none of this wisdom or working in the grave.
Deny me not thy grace, for, if thou do, I die, I perish; if thou be
silent to me, I am like those that go down to the pit, [Psa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001.md). Deny me not before I die; as
long as I continue in the land of the living, let me continue under the
conduct of thy grace and good providence."

II\. The prayer itself. The two things he requires are grace sufficient
and food convenient. 1. Grace sufficient for his soul: "Remove from me
vanity and lies; deliver me from sin, from all corrupt principles,
practices, and affections, from error and mistake, which are at the
bottom of all sin, from the love of the world and the things of it,
which are all vanity and a lie." Some understand it as a prayer for the
pardon of sin, for, when God forgives sin, he removes it, he takes it
away. Or, rather, it is a prayer of the same import with that, Lead us
not into temptation. Nothing is more mischievous to us than sin, and
therefore there is nothing which we should more earnestly pray against
than that we may do no evil. 2. Food convenient for his body. Having
prayed for the operations of divine grace, he here begs the favours of
the divine Providence, but such as may tend to the good and not to the
prejudice of the soul. (1.) He prays that of God's free gift he might
receive a competent portion of the good things of this life: "Feed me
with the bread of my allowance, such bread as thou thinkest fit to allow
me." As to all the gifts of the divine Providence, we must refer
ourselves to the divine wisdom. Or, "the bread that is fit for me, as a
man, a master of a family, that which is agreeable to my rank and
condition in the world." For as is the man so is his competency. Our
Saviour seems to refer to this when he teaches us to pray, Give us this
day our daily bread, as this seems to refer to Jacob's vow, in which he
wished for no more than bread to eat and raiment to put on. Food
convenient for us is what we ought to be content with, though we have
not dainties, varieties, and superfluities - what is for necessity,
though we have not for delight and ornament; and it is what we may in
faith pray for and depend upon God for. (2.) He prays that he may be
kept from every condition of life that would be a temptation to him.
\[1.\] He prays against the extremes of abundance and want: Give me
neither poverty nor riches. He does not hereby prescribe to God, nor
pretend to teach him what condition he shall allot to him, nor does he
pray against poverty or riches absolutely, as in themselves evil, for
either of them, by the grace of God, may be sanctified and be a means of
good to us; but, First, He hereby intends to express the value which
wise and good men have for a middle state of life, and, with submission
to the will of God, desires that that might be his state, neither great
honour nor great contempt. We must learn how to manage both (as St.
Paul, [Phi 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#012).md), but rather wish to
be always between both. Optimus pecuniae modus qui nec in paupertatem
cedit nec procul paupertate discedit - The best condition is that which
neither implies poverty nor yet recedes far from it. Seneca. Secondly,
He hereby intimates a holy jealousy he had of himself, that he could not
keep his ground against the temptations either of an afflicted or a
prosperous condition. Others may preserve their integrity in either, but
he is afraid of both, and therefore grace teaches him to pray against
riches as much as nature against poverty; but the will of the Lord be
done. \[2.\] He gives a pious reason for his prayer, [Pro
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#009.md). He does not say, "Lest I be
rich, and cumbered with care, and envied by my neighbours, and eaten up
with a multitude of servants, or, lest I be poor and trampled on, and
forced to work hard and fare hard;" but, "Lest I be rich and sin, or
poor and sin." Sin is that which a good man is afraid of in every
condition and under every event; witness Nehemiah ([Neh
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#013).md), that I should be afraid, and do
so, and sin. First, He dreads the temptations of a prosperous condition,
and therefore even deprecates that: Lest I be full and deny thee (as
Jeshurun, who waxed fat and kicked, and forsook God who made him, [Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015).md), and say, as Pharaoh in his
pride, Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice? Prosperity makes
people proud and forgetful of God, as if they had no need of him and
were therefore under no obligation to him. What can the Almighty do for
them? [Job 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#017.md). And therefore they
will do nothing for him. Even good men are afraid of the worst sins, so
deceitful do they think their own hearts to be; and they know that the
greatest gains of the world will not balance the least guilt. Secondly,
He dreads the temptations of a poor condition, and for that reason, and
no other, deprecates that: Lest I be poor and steal. Poverty is a strong
temptation to dishonesty, and such as many are overcome by, and they are
ready to think it will be their excuse; but it will not bear them out at
God's bar any more than at men's to say, "I stole because I was poor;"
yet, if a man steal for the satisfying of his soul when he is hungry, it
is a case of compassion ([Pro 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#030).md)
and what even those that have some principles of honesty in them may be
drawn to. But observe why Agur dreads this, not because he should
endanger himself by it, "Lest I steal, and be hanged for it, whipped or
put in the stocks, or sold for a bondman," as among the Jews poor
thieves were, who had not wherewithal to make restitution; but lest he
should dishonour God by it: "Lest I should steal, and take the name of
my God in vain, that is, discredit my profession of religion by
practices disagreeable to it." Or, "Lest I steal, and, when I am charged
with it, forswear myself." He therefore dreads one sin, because it would
draw on another, for the way of sin is downhill. Observe, He calls God
his God, and therefore he is afraid of doing any thing to offend him
because of the relation he stands in to him.

[Proverbs 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 30:10</span></span>

Here is, I. A caution not to abuse other people's servants any more than
our own, nor to make mischief between them and their masters, for it is
an ill office, invidious, and what will make a man odious, [Pro
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#010.md). Consider, 1. It is an injury to
the servant, whose poor condition makes him an object of pity, and
therefore it is barbarous to add affliction to him that is afflicted:
Hurt not a servant with thy tongue (so the margin reads it); for it
argues a sordid disposition to smite any body secretly with the scourge
of the tongue, especially a servant, who is not a match for us, and whom
we should rather protect, if his master be severe with him, than
exasperate him more. 2. "It will perhaps be an injury to thyself. If a
servant be thus provoked, perhaps he will curse thee, will accuse thee
and bring thee into trouble, or give thee an ill word and blemish thy
reputation, or appeal to God against thee, and imprecate his wrath upon
thee, who is the patron and protector of oppressed innocency."

II\. An account, upon occasion of this caution, of some wicked
generations of men, that are justly abominable to all that are virtuous
and good. 1. Such as are abusive to their parents, give them bad
language and wish them ill, call them bad names and actually injure
them. There is a generation of such; young men of that black character
commonly herd together, and irritate one another against their parents.
A generation of vipers those are who curse their natural parents, or
their magistrates, or their ministers, because they cannot endure the
yoke; and those are near of kin to them who, though they have not yet
arrived at such a pitch of wickedness as to curse their parents, yet do
not bless them, cannot give them a good word, and will not pray for
them. 2. Such as are conceited of themselves, and, under a show and
pretence of sanctity, hide from others, and perhaps from themselves too,
abundance of reigning wickedness in secret ([Pro
30:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#012).md); they are pure in their own
eyes, as if they were in all respects such as they should be. They have
a very good opinion of themselves and their own character, that they are
not only righteous, but rich and increased with goods ([Rev
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#017).md), and yet are not cleansed from
their filthiness, the filthiness of their hearts, which they pretend to
be the best part of them. They are, it may be, swept and garnished, but
they are not washed, nor sanctified; as the Pharisees that within were
full of all uncleanness, [Mat 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#025.md),
[Mat 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#026.md). 3. Such as are haughty and
scornful to those about them, [Pro
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#013.md). He speaks of them with
amazement at their intolerable pride and insolence: "Oh how lofty are
their eyes! With what disdain do they look upon their neighbours, as not
worthy to be set with the dogs of their flock! What a distance do they
expect every body should keep; and, when they look upon themselves, how
do they strut and vaunt like the peacock, thinking they make themselves
illustrious when really they make themselves ridiculous!" There is a
generation of such, on whom he that resists the proud will pour
contempt. 4. Such as are cruel to the poor and barbarous to all that lie
at their mercy ([Pro 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#014).md); their
teeth are iron and steel, swords and knives, instruments of cruelty,
with which they devour the poor with the greatest pleasure imaginable,
and as greedily as hungry men cut their meat and eat it. God has so
ordered it that the poor we shall always have with us, that they shall
never cease out of the land; but there are those who, because they hate
to relieve them, would, if they could, abolish them from the earth, from
among men, especially God's poor. Some understand it of those who wound
and ruin others by slanders and false accusations, and severe censures
of their everlasting state; their tongues, and their teeth too (which
are likewise organs of speech), are as swords and knives, [Psa
57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004.md).

[Proverbs 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 30:15</span></span>

He had spoken before of those that devoured the poor ([Pro
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#014).md), and had spoken of them last,
as the worst of all the four generations there mentioned; now here he
speaks of their insatiableness in doing this. The temper that puts them
upon it is made up of cruelty and covetousness. Now those are two
daughters of the horse-leech, its genuine offspring, that still cry,
"Give, give, give more blood, give more money;" for the bloody are still
blood-thirsty; being drunk with blood, they add thirst to their
drunkenness, and will seek it yet again. Those also that love silver
shall never be satisfied with silver. Thus, while from these two
principles they are devouring the poor, they are continually uneasy to
themselves, as David's enemies, [Psa
59:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#014.md), [Psa
59:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#015.md). Now, for the further
illustration of this,

I. He specifies four other things which are insatiable, to which those
devourers are compared, which say not, It is enough, or It is wealth.
Those are never rich that are always coveting. Now these four things
that are always craving are, 1. The grave, into which multitudes fall,
and yet still more will fall, and it swallows them all up, and returns
none, Hell and destruction are never full, [Pro
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#020.md). When it comes to our turn we
shall find the grave ready for us, [Job
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#001.md). 2. The barren womb, which is
impatient of its affliction in being barren, and cries, as Rachel did,
Give me children. 3. The parched ground in time of drought (especially
in those hot countries), which still soaks in the rain that comes in
abundance upon it and in a little time wants more. 4. The fire, which,
when it has consumed abundance of fuel, yet still devours all the
combustible matter that is thrown into it. So insatiable are the corrupt
desires of sinners, and so little satisfaction have they even in the
gratification of them.

II\. He adds a terrible threatening to disobedient children ([Pro
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#017).md), for warning to the first of
those four wicked generations, that curse their parents ([Pro
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#011).md), and shows here,

1\. Who they are that belong to that generation, not only those that
curse their parents in heat and passion, but, (1.) Those that mock at
them, though it be but with a scornful eye, looking with disdain upon
them because of their bodily infirmities, or looking sour or dogged at
them when they instruct or command, impatient at their checks and angry
at them. God takes notice with what eye children look upon their
parents, and will reckon for the leering look and the casts of the evil
eye as well as for the bad language given them. (2.) Those that despise
to obey them, that think it a thing below them to be dutiful to their
parents, especially to the mother, they scorn to be controlled by her;
and thus she that bore them in sorrow in greater sorrow bears their
manners.

2\. What their doom will be. Those that dishonour their parents shall be
set up as monuments of God's vengeance; they shall be hanged in chains,
as it were, for the birds of prey to pick out their eyes, those eyes
with which they looked so scornfully on their good parents. The dead
bodies of malefactors were not to hang all night, but before night the
ravens would have picked out their eyes. If men do not punish undutiful
children, God will, and will load those with the greatest infamy that
conduct themselves haughtily towards their parents. Many who have come
to an ignominious end have owned that the wicked courses that brought
them to it began in a contempt of their parents' authority.

Here is, I. An account of four things that are unsearchable, too
wonderful to be fully known. And here,

1\. The first three are natural things, and are only designed as
comparisons for the illustration of the last. We cannot trace, (1.) An
eagle in the air. Which way she has flown cannot be discovered either by
the footstep or by the scent, as the way of a beast may upon ground; nor
can we account for the wonderful swiftness of her flight, how soon she
has gone beyond our ken. (2.) A serpent upon a rock. The way of a
serpent in the sand we may find by the track, but not of a serpent upon
the hard rock; nor can we describe how a serpent will, without feet, in
a little time creep to the top of a rock. (3.) A ship in the midst of
the sea. The leviathan indeed makes a path to shine after him, one would
think the deep to be hoary ([Job
41:32](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#032).md), but a ship leaves no mark
behind it, and sometimes it is so tossed upon the waves that one would
wonder how it lives at sea and gains its point. The kingdom of nature is
full of wonders, marvellous things which the God of nature does, past
finding out.

2\. The fourth is a mystery of iniquity, more unaccountable than any of
these; it belongs to the depths of Satan, that deceitfulness and that
desperate wickedness of the heart which none can know, [Jer
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#009). It is twofold: - (1..md) The cursed
arts which a vile adulterer has to debauch a maid, and to persuade her
to yield to his wicked and abominable lust. This is what a wanton poet
wrote a whole book of, long since, De arte amandi - On the art of love.
By what pretensions and protestations of love, and all its powerful
charms, promises of marriage, assurances of secresy and reward, is many
an unwary virgin brought to sell her virtue, and honour, and peace, and
soul, and all to a base traitor; for so all sinful lust is in the
kingdom of love. The more artfully the temptation is managed the more
watchful and resolute ought every pure heart to be against it. (2.) The
cursed arts which a vile adulteress has to conceal her wickedness,
especially from her husband, from whom she treacherously departs; so
close are her intrigues with her lewd companions, and so craftily
disguised, that it is as impossible to discover her as to track an eagle
in the air. She eats the forbidden fruit, after the similitude of Adam's
transgression, and then wipes her mouth, that it may not betray itself,
and with a bold and impudent face says, I have done no wickedness.
\[1.\] To the world she denies the fact, and is ready to swear it that
she is as chaste and modest as any woman, and never did the wickedness
she is suspected of. Those are the works of darkness which are
industriously kept from coming to the light. \[2.\] To her own
conscience (if she have any left) she denies the fault, and will not own
that that great wickedness is any wickedness at all, but an innocent
entertainment. See [Hos 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#007.md), [Hos
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#008.md). Thus multitudes ruin their souls
by calling evil good and out-facing their convictions with a
self-justification.

II\. An account of four things that are intolerable, that is, four sorts
of persons that are very troublesome to the places where they live and
the relations and companies they are in; the earth is disquieted for
them, and groans under them as a burden it cannot bear, and they are all
much alike: - 1. A servant when he is advanced, and entrusted with
power, who is, of all others, most insolent and imperious; witness
Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, [Neh
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#010.md). 2. A fool, a silly, rude,
boisterous, vicious man, who when he has grown rich, and is partaking of
the pleasures of the table, will disturb all the company with his
extravagant talk and the affronts he will put upon those about him. 3.
An ill-natured, cross-grained, woman, when she gets a husband, one who,
having made herself odious by her pride and sourness, so that one would
not have thought any body would ever love her, yet, if at last she be
married, that honourable estate makes her more intolerably scornful and
spiteful than ever. It is a pity that that which should sweeten the
disposition should have a contrary effect. A gracious woman, when she is
married, will be yet more obliging. 4. An old maid-servant that has
prevailed with her mistress, by humouring her, and, as we say, getting
the length of her foot, to leave her what she has, or is as dear to her
as if she was to be her heir, such a one likewise will be intolerably
proud and malicious, and think all too little that her mistress gives
her, and herself wronged if any thing be left from her. Let those
therefore whom Providence has advanced to honour from mean beginnings
carefully watch against that sin which will most easily beset them,
pride and haughtiness, which will in them, of all others, be most
insufferable and inexcusable; and let them humble themselves with the
remembrance of the rock out of which they were hewn.

[Proverbs 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 30:24</span></span>

I. Agur, having specified four things that seem great and yet are really
contemptible, here specifies four things that are little and yet are
very admirable, great in miniature, in which, as bishop Patrick
observes, he teaches us several good lessons; as, 1. Not to admire
bodily bulk, or beauty, or strength, nor to value persons or think the
better of them for such advantages, but to judge of men by their wisdom
and conduct, their industry and application to business, which are
characters that deserve respect. 2. To admire the wisdom and power of
the Creator in the smallest and most despicable animals, in an ant as
much as in an elephant. 3. To blame ourselves who do not act so much for
our own true interest as the meanest creatures do for theirs. 4. Not to
despise the weak things of the world; there are those that are little
upon the earth, poor in the world and of small account, and yet are
exceedingly wise, wise for their souls and another world, and those are
exceedingly wise, wiser than their neighbours. Margin, They are wise,
made wise by the special instinct of nature. All that are wise to
salvation are made wise by the grace of God.

II\. Those he specifies are, 1. The ants, minute animals and very weak,
and yet they are very industrious in gathering proper food, and have a
strange sagacity to do it in the summer, the proper time. This is so
great a piece of wisdom that we may learn of them to be wise for
futurity, [Pro 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#006.md). When the ravening
lions lack, and suffer hunger, the laborious ants have plenty, and know
no want. 2. The conies, or, as some rather understand it, the Arabian
mice, field mice, weak creatures, and very timorous, yet they have so
much wisdom as to make their houses in the rocks, where they are well
guarded, and their feebleness makes them take shelter in those natural
fastnesses and fortifications. Sense of our own indigence and weakness
should drive us to him that is a rock higher than we for shelter and
support; there let us make our habitation. 3. The locusts; they are
little also, and have no king, as the bees have, but they go forth all
of them by bands, like an army in battle-array; and, observing such good
order among themselves, it is not any inconvenience to them that they
have no king. They are called God's great army ([Joe
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#025).md); for, when he pleases, he
musters, he marshals them, and wages war by them, as he did upon Egypt.
They go forth all of them gathered together (so the margin); sense of
weakness should engage us to keep together, that we may strengthen the
hands of one another. 4. The spider, an insect, but as great an instance
of industry in our houses as the ants are in the field. Spiders are very
ingenious in weaving their webs with a fineness and exactness such as no
art can pretend to come near: They take hold with their hands, and spin
a fine thread out of their own bowels, with a great deal of art; and
they are not only in poor men's cottages, but in kings' palaces,
notwithstanding all the care that is there taken to destroy them.
Providence wonderfully keeps up those kinds of creatures, not only which
men provide not for, but which every man's hand is against and seeks the
destruction of. Those that will mind their business, and take hold of it
with their hands, shall be in kings' palaces; sooner or later, they will
get preferment, and may go on with it, notwithstanding the difficulties
and discouragements they meet with. If one well-spun web be swept away,
it is but making another.

[Proverbs 30:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 30:29</span></span>

Here is, I. An enumeration of four things which are majestic and stately
in their going, which look great: - 1. A lion, the king of beasts,
because strongest among beasts. Among beasts it is strength that gives
the pre-eminence, but it is a pity that it should do so among men, whose
wisdom is their honour, not their strength and force. The lion turns not
away, nor alters his pace, for fear of any pursuers, since he knows he
is too hard for them. Herein the righteous are bold as a lion, that they
turn not away from their duty for fear of any difficulty they meet with
in it. 2. A greyhound that is girt in the loins and fit for running; or
(as the margin reads it) a horse, which ought not to be omitted among
the creatures that are comely in going, for so he is, especially when he
is dressed up in his harness or trappings. 3. A he-goat, the comeliness
of whose going is when he goes first and leads the flock. It is the
comeliness of a Christian's going to go first in a good work and to lead
others in the right way. 4. A king, who, when he appears in his majesty,
is looked upon with reverence and awe, and all agree that there is no
rising up against him; none can vie with him, none can contend with him,
whoever does it, it is at his peril. And, if there is no rising up
against an earthly prince, woe to him then that strives with his Maker.
It is intended that we should learn courage and fortitude in all
virtuous actions from the lion and not to turn away for any difficulty
we meet with; from the greyhound we may learn quickness and despatch,
from the he-goat the care of our family and those under our charge, and
from a king to have our children in subjection with all gravity, and
from them all to go well, and to order the steps of our conversation so
as that we may not only be safe, but comely, in going.

II\. A caution to us to keep our temper at all times and under all
provocations, and to take heed of carrying our resentments too far upon
any occasion, especially when there is a king in the case, against whom
there is no rising up, when it is a ruler, or one much our superior,
that is offended; nay, the rule is always the same.

1\. We must bridle and suppress our own passion, and take shame to
ourselves, whenever we are justly charged with a fault, and not insist
upon our own innocency: If we have lifted up ourselves, either in a
proud conceit of ourselves or a peevish opposition to those that are
over us, if we have transgressed the laws of our place and station, we
have therein done foolishly. Those that magnify themselves over others
or against others, that are haughty and insolent, do but shame
themselves and betray their own weakness. Nay, if we have but thought
evil, if we are conscious to ourselves that we have harboured an ill
design in our minds, or it has been suggested to us, we must lay our
hand upon our mouth, that is, (1.) We must humble ourselves for what we
have done amiss, and even lie in the dust before God, in sorrow for it,
as Job did, when he repented of what he had said foolishly ([Job
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#004.md), I will lay my hand upon my
mouth), and as the convicted leper, who put a covering upon his upper
lip. If we have done foolishly, we must not stand to it before men, but
by silence own our guilt, which will be the best way of appeasing those
we have offended. 2. We must keep the evil thought we have conceived in
our minds from breaking out in any evil speeches. Do not give the evil
thought an imprimatur - a license; allow it not to be published; but lay
thy hand upon thy mouth; use a holy violence with thyself, if need be,
and enjoin thyself silence; as Christ suffered not the evil spirits to
speak. It is bad to think ill, but it is much worse to speak it, for
that implies a consent to the evil thought and a willingness to infect
others with it.

2\. We must not irritate the passions of others. Some are so very
provoking in their words and conduct that they even force wrath, they
make those about them angry whether they will or no, and put those into
a passion who are not only not inclined to it, but resolved against it.
Now this forcing of wrath brings forth strife, and where that is there
is confusion and every evil work. As the violent agitation of the cream
fetches all the good out of the milk, and the hard wringing of the nose
will extort blood from it, so this forcing of wrath wastes both the body
and spirits of a man, and robs him of all the good that is in him. Or,
as it is in the churning of milk and the wringing of the nose, that is
done by force which otherwise would not be done, so the spirit is heated
by degrees with strong passions; one angry word begets another, and that
a third; one passionate debate makes work for another, and so it goes on
till it ends at length in irreconcilable feuds. Let nothing therefore be
said or done with violence, but every thing with softness and calmness.
