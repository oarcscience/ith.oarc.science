### [Micah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md)

[Micah](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mic 4:0</span></span>

Comparing this chapter with the close of the foregoing chapter, the
comfortable promises here with the terrible threatenings there, we may,
with the apostle, "behold the goodness and severity of God," ([Rom
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#022).md), towards the Jewish church
which fell, severity when Zion was ploughed as a field, but towards the
Christian church, which was built upon the ruins of it, goodness, great
goodness; for it is here promised, I. That it shall be advanced and
enlarged by the accession of the nations to it ([Mic
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md), [Mic
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#002).md). II. That it shall be protected
in tranquility and peace ([Mic 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#003.md),
[Mic 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#004).md). III. That it shall be kept
close, and constant, and faithful to God ([Mic
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#005).md). IV. That under Christ's
government, all its grievances shall be redressed ([Mic
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#006.md), [Mic
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#007).md). V. That it shall have an ample
and flourishing dominion ([Mic 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#008).md).
VI. That its troubles shall be brought to a happy issue at length ([Mic
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009.md), [Mic
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010).md). VII. That its enemies shall be
disquieted, nay, that they shall be destroyed in and by their attempts
against it ([Mic 4:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011).md).

[Micah 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 4:1</span></span>

It is a very comfortable but with which this chapter begins, and very
reviving to those who lay the interests of God's church near their heart
and are concerned for the welfare of it. When we sometimes see the
corruptions of the church, especially of church-rulers, princes,
priests, and prophets, seeking their own things and not the things of
God, and when we soon after see the desolations of the church, Zion for
their sakes ploughed as a field, we are ready to fear that it will one
day perish between both, that the name of Israel shall be no more in
remembrance; we are ready to give up all for gone, and to conclude the
church will have neither root not branch upon earth. But let not our
faith fail in this matter; out of the ashes of the church another
phoenix shall arise. In the last words of the foregoing chapter we left
the mountain of the house as desolate and waste as the high places of
the forest; and is it possible that such a wilderness should ever become
a fruitful field again? Yes, the first words of this chapter bring in
the mountain of the Lord's house as much dignified by being frequented
as ever it had been disgraced by being deserted. Though Zion be ploughed
as a field, yet God has not cast off his people, but by the fall of the
Jews salvation has come to the Gentiles, so that it proves to be the
riches of the world, [Rom 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011.md), [Rom
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012.md). This is the mystery which God
by the prophet here shows us, and he says the very same in the first
three verses of this chapter which another prophet said by the word of
the Lord at the same time ([Isa
2:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002).md), that out of the mouth of these
two witnesses these promises might be established; and very precious
promises they are, relating to the gospel-church, which have been in
part accomplished, and will be yet more and more, for he is faithful
that has promised.

I. That there shall be a church for God set up in the world, after the
defection and destruction of the Jewish church, and this in the last
days; that is, as some of the rabbin themselves acknowledge, in the days
of the Messiah. The people of God shall be incorporated by a new
charter, a new spiritual way of worship shall be enacted, and a new
institution of offices to attend it; better privileges shall be granted
by this new charter, and better provision made for enlarging and
establishing the kingdom of God among men than had been made by the Old
Testament constitution: The mountain of the house of the Lord shall
again appear firm ground for God's faithful worshippers to stand, and
go, and build upon, in their attendance on him, [Mic
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md). And it shall be a centre of unity
to them; a church shall be set up in the world, to which the Lord will
be daily adding such as shall be saved.

II\. That this church shall be firmly founded and well-built: It shall
be established in the top of the mountains; Christ himself will build it
upon a rock; it shall be an impregnable fort upon an immovable
foundation, so that the gates of hell shall neither overthrow the one
nor undermine the other ([Mat 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018).md);
its foundations are still in the holy mountains ([Psa
87:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001).md), the everlasting mountains,
which cannot, which shall not, be removed. It shall be established, not
as the temple, upon one mountain, but upon many; for the foundations of
the church, as they are sure, so they are large.

III\. That it shall be highly advanced, and become eminent and
conspicuous: It shall be exalted above the hills, observed with wonder
for its growing greatness from small beginnings. The kingdom of Christ
shall shine with greater lustre than ever any of the kingdoms of the
earth did. It shall be as a city on a hill, which cannot be hid, [Mat
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014.md). The glory of this latter house
is greater than that of the former, [Hag
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009.md). See [Co2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007.md), [Co2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#008.md), etc.

IV\. That there shall be a great accession of converts to it and
succession of converts in it. People shall flow unto it as the waters of
a river are continually flowing; there shall be a constant stream of
believers flowing in from all parts into the church, as the people of
the Jews flowed into the temple, while it was standing, to worship
there. Then many tribes came to the mountain of the house, to enquire of
God's temple; but in gospel-times many nations shall flow into the
church, shall fly like a cloud and as the doves to their windows.
Ministers shall be sent forth to disciple all nations, and they shall
not labour in vain; for, multitudes being wrought upon to believe the
gospel and embrace the Christian religion, they shall excite and
encourage one another, and shall say, "Come, and let us go up to the
mountain of the Lord now raised among us, even to the house of the God
of Jacob, the spiritual temple which we need not travel far to, for it
is brought to our doors and set up in the midst of us." Thus shall
people be made willing in the day of his power ([Psa
110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003).md), and shall do what they can to
make others willing, as Andrew invited Peter, and Philip Nathanael, to
be acquainted with Christ. They shall call the people to the mountain
([Deu 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#019).md), for there is in Christ
enough for all, enough for each. Now observe what it is, 1. Which these
converts expect to find in the house of the God of Jacob. They come
thither for instruction: "He will teach us of his ways, what is the way
in which he would have us to walk with him and in which we may depend
upon him to meet us graciously." Note, Where we come to worship God we
come to be taught of him. 2. Which they engage to do when they are thus
taught of God: We will walk in his paths. Note, Those may comfortably
expect that God will teach them who are firmly resolved by his grace to
do as they are taught.

V. That, in order to this, a new revelation shall be published to the
world, on which the church shall be founded, and by which multitudes
shall be brought into it: For the law shall go forth of Zion, and the
word of the Lord from Jerusalem. The gospel is here called the word of
the Lord, for the Lord gave the word, and great was the company of those
that published it, [Psa 68:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#011.md). It was
of a divine original, a divine authority; it began to be spoken by the
Lord Christ himself, [Heb 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#003.md). And it
is a law, a law of faith; we are under the law to Christ. This was to go
forth from Jerusalem, from Zion, the metropolis of the Old Testament
dispensation, where the temple, and altars, and oracles were, and
whither the Jews went to worship from all parts; thence the gospel must
take rise, to show the connexion between the Old Testament and the New,
that the gospel is not set up in opposition to the law, but is an
explication and illustration of it, and a branch growing out of its
roots. It was in Jerusalem that Christ preached and wrought miracles;
there he died, rose again, and ascended; there the Spirit was poured
out; and those that were to preach repentance and remission of sins to
all nations were ordered to begin at Jerusalem, so that thence flowed
the streams that were to water the desert world.

VI\. That a convincing power should go along with the gospel of Christ,
in all places where it should be preached ([Mic
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#003).md): He shall judge among many
people. Messiah, the lawgiver ([Mic
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#002)..md), is here the judge, for to him
the Father committed all judgment, and for judgment he came into this
world; his word, the word of his gospel, that was to go forth from
Jerusalem, was the golden sceptre by which he shall rule and judge when
he sits as king on the holy hill of Zion, [Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md). By it he shall rebuke strong
nations afar off; for the Spirit working with the word shall reprove the
world, [Joh 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008.md). It is promised to
the Son of David that he shall judge among the heathen ([Psa
110:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#006).md), which he does when in the
chariot of his everlasting gospel he goes forth, and goes on, conquering
and to conquer.

VII\. That a disposition to mutual peace and love shall be the happy
effect of the setting up of the kingdom of the Messiah: They shall beat
their swords into plough-shares; that is, angry passionate men, that
have been fierce and furious, shall be wonderfully sweetened, and made
mild and meek, [Tit 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#002.md), [Tit
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#003.md). Those who, before their
conversion, did injuries, and would bear none, after their conversion
can bear injuries, but will do none. As far as the gospel prevails it
makes men peaceable, for such is the wisdom from above; it is gentle and
easy to be entreated; and if nations were but leavened by it, there
would be universal peace. When Christ was born there was universal peace
in the Roman empire; those that were first brought into the gospel
church were all of one heart and of one soul ([Act
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#032).md); and it was observed of the
primitive Christians how well they loved one another. In heaven this
will have its full accomplishment. It is promised, 1. That none shall be
quarrelsome. The art of war, instead of being improved (which some
reckon the glory of a kingdom), shall be forgotten and laid aside as
useless. They shall not learn war any more as they have done, for they
shall have no need to defend themselves nor any inclination to offend
their neighbours. Nation shall no longer lift up sword against nation;
not that the gospel will make men cowards, but it will make men
peaceable. 2. That all shall be quiet, both from evil and from the fear
of evil ([Mic 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#004).md): They shall sit
safely, and none shall disturb them; they shall sit securely, and shall
not disturb themselves, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree,
enjoying the fruit of them, and needing no other shelter than the leaves
of them. None shall make them afraid; not only there shall be nothing
that is likely to frighten them, but they shall not be disposed to fear.
under the dominion of Christ, as that of Solomon, there shall be
abundance of peace. Though his followers have trouble in the world, in
him they enjoy great tranquillity. If this seems unlikely, yet we may
depend upon it, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it, and no word of
his shall fall to the ground; what he has spoken by his word he will do
by his providence and grace. He that is the Lord of hosts will be the
God of peace; and those may well be easy whom the Lord of hosts, of all
hosts, undertakes the protection of.

VIII\. That the churches shall be constant in their duty, and so shall
make a good use of their tranquillity and shall not provoke the Lord to
deprive them of it, [Mic 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#005.md). When the
churches have rest they shall be edified, and confirmed, and comforted,
and shall resolve to be as firm to their God as other nations are to
theirs, though they be no gods. Where we find the foregoing promises,
[Isa 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md), etc. it follows ([Mic
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#005).md), O house of Jacob! come ye, and
let us walk in the light of the Lord; and here, We will walk in the name
of the Lord our God. Note, Peace is a blessing indeed when it
strengthens our resolutions to cleave to the Lord. Observe, 1. How
constant other nations were to their gods: All people will walk every
one in the name of his god, will own their god and cleave to him, will
worship their god and serve him, will depend upon him and put confidence
in him. Whatever men make a god of they will make use of, and take his
name along with them in all their actions and affairs. The mariners, in
a storm, cried every man to his god, [Jon
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#005.md). And no instance could be found of
a nation's changing its gods, [Jer
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#011.md) : If the hosts of heaven were
their gods, they loved them, and served them, and walked after them,
[Jer 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#002.md). 2. How constant God's people
now resolve to be to him: "We will walk in the name of the Lord our God,
will acknowledge him in all our ways, and govern ourselves by a
continual regard to him, doing nothing but what we have warrant from him
for, and openly professing our relation to him." Observe, Their
resolution is peremptory; it is not a thing that needs be disputed: "We
will walk in the name of the Lord our God." It is just and reasonable:
He is our God. And it is a resolution for a perpetuity: "We will do it
for ever and ever, and will never leave him. He will be ours for ever,
and therefore so we will be his, and never repent our choice."

IX\. That notwithstanding the dispersions, distress, and infirmities of
the church, it shall be formed and established, and made very
considerable, [Mic 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#006.md), [Mic
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#007.md). 1. The state of the church had
been low, and weak, and very helpless, in the latter times of the Old
Testament, partly through the corruptions of the Jewish nation, and
partly through the oppressions under which they groaned. They were like
a flock of sheep that were maimed, worried, and scattered, [Eze
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#016.md); [Jer
50:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#006.md). 17. The good people among them,
and in other places, that were well inclined, were dispersed, were very
infirm, and in a manner lost and cast far off. 2. It is promised that
all these grievances shall be redressed and the distemper healed. Christ
will come himself ([Mat 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#024).md), and
send his apostles to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, [Mat
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#006.md). From among the Jews that halted,
or that for want of strength, could not go upright, God gathered a
remnant ([Mic 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#007).md), that remnant
according to the election of grace which is spoken of in [Rom
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#007.md), which embraced the gospel of
Christ. And from among the Gentiles that were cast far off (so the
Gentiles are described to be, [Eph
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#013.md), [Act
2:39](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#039).md) he raised a strong nation;
greater numbers of them were brought into the church than of the Jews,
[Gal 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#027.md). And such a strong nation
the gospel-church is that the gates of hell shall never be able to
prevail against it. The church of Christ is more numerous than any other
nation, and strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.

X. That the Messiah shall be the king of this kingdom, shall protect and
govern it, and order all the affairs of it for the best, and this to the
end of time. The Lord Jesus shall reign over them in Mount Zion by his
word and Spirit in his ordinances, and this henceforth and for ever, for
of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.

[Micah 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 4:8</span></span>

These verses relate to Zion and Jerusalem, here called the tower of the
flock or the tower of Edor; we read of such a place ([Gen
35:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#021).md) near Bethlehem; and some
conjecture it is the same place where the shepherds were keeping their
flocks when the angels brought them tidings of the birth of Christ, and
some think Bethlehem itself is here spoken of, as [Mic
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002.md). Some think it is a tower at that
gate of Jerusalem which is called the sheep-gate ([Neh
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#032).md), and conjecture that through
that gate Christ rode in triumph into Jerusalem. However, it seems to be
put for Jerusalem itself, or for Zion the tower of David. All the sheep
of Israel flocked thither three times a year; it was the stronghold
(Ophel, which is also a name of a place in Jerusalem, [Neh
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#027).md), or castle, of the daughter of
Zion. Now here,

I. We have a promise of the glories of the spiritual Jerusalem, the
gospel-church, which is; the tower of the flock, that one fold in which
all the sheep of Christ are protected under one Shepherd: "Unto thee
shall it come; that which thou hast long wanted and wished for, even the
first dominion, a dignity and power equal to that of David and Solomon,
by whom Jerusalem was first raised, that kingdom shall again come to the
daughter of Jerusalem, which it was deprived of at the captivity. It
shall make as great a figure and shine with as much lustre among the
nations, and have as much influence upon them, as ever it had; this is
the first or chief dominion." Now this had by no means its
accomplishment in Zerubbabel; his was nothing like the first dominion
either in respect of splendour and sovereignty at home or the extent of
power abroad; and therefore it must refer to the kingdom of the Messiah
(and to that the Chaldee-paraphrase refers it) and had its
accomplishment when God gave to our Lord Jesus the throne of his father
David ([Luk 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032).md), set him king upon
the holy hill of Zion and gave him the heathen for his inheritance ([Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006).md), made him, his first-born, higher
than the kings of the earth, [Psa
89:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#027.md); [Dan
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014.md). David, in spirit, called him
Lord, and (as Dr. Pocock observes) he witnessed of himself, and his
witness was true, that he was greater than Solomon, none of their
dominions being like his for extent and duration. The common people
welcomed Christ into Jerusalem with hosannas to the son of David, to
show that it was the first dominion that came to the daughter of Zion;
and the evangelist applies it to the promise of Zion's king coming to
her, [Mat 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#005.md); [Zac
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009.md). Some give this sense of the
words: To Zion, and Jerusalem that tower of the flock, to the nation of
the Jews, came the first dominion; that is, there the kingdom of Christ
was first set up, the gospel of the kingdom was first preached ([Luk
24:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047).md), there Christ was first called
king of the Jews.

II\. This is illustrated by a prediction of the calamities of the
literal Jerusalem, to which some favour and relief should be granted, as
a type and figure of what God would do for the gospel-Jerusalem in the
last days, notwithstanding its distresses. We have here,

1\. Jerusalem put in pain by the providences of God. "She cries out
aloud, that all her neighbours may take notice of her griefs, because
there is no king in her, none of that honour and power she used to have.
Instead of ruling the nations, as she did when she sat a queen, she is
ruled by them, and has become a captive. Her counsellors have perished;
she is no longer at her own disposal, but is given up to the will of her
enemies, and is governed by their counsellors. Pangs have taken her."
(1.) She is carried captive to Babylon, and there is in pangs of grief.
"She goes forth out of the city, and is constrained to dwell in the
field, exposed to all manner of inconveniences; she goes even to
Babylon, and there wears out seventy tedious years in a miserable
captivity, all that while in pain, as a woman in travail, waiting to be
delivered, and thinking the time very long." (2.) When she is delivered
out of Babylon, and redeemed from the hand of her enemies there, yet
still she is in pangs of fear; the end of one trouble is but the
beginning of another; for now also, when Jerusalem is in the rebuilding,
many nations are gathered against her, [Mic
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011.md). They were so in Ezra's and
Nehemiah's time, and did all they could to obstruct the building of the
temple and the wall. They were so in the time of the Maccabees; they
said, Let her be defiled; let her be looked upon as a place polluted
with sin, and be forsaken and abandoned both of God and man; let her
holy places be profaned and all her honours laid in the dust; let our
eye look upon Zion, and please itself with the sight of its ruins, as it
is said of Edom ([Oba 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#012.md), Thou
shouldst not have looked upon the day of thy brother); let our eyes see
our desire upon Zion, the day we have long wished for. When they hear
the enemies thus combine against them, and insult over them, no wonder
that they are in pain, and cry aloud. Without are fightings, within are
fears.

2\. Jerusalem made easy by the promises of God: "Why dost thou cry out
aloud? Let thy griefs and fears be silenced; indulge not thyself in
them, for, though things are bad with thee, they shall end well; thy
pangs are great, but they are like those of a woman in travail ([Mic
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009).md), that labours to bring forth
([Mic 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010).md), the issue of which will
be good at last." Jerusalem's pangs are not as dying agonies, but as
travailing throes, which after a while will be forgotten, for joy that a
child is born into the world. Let the literal Jerusalem comfort herself
with this, that, whatever straits she may be reduced to, she shall
continue until the coming of the Messiah, for there his kingdom must be
first set up, and she shall not be destroyed while that blessing is in
her; and when at length she is ploughed as a field, and become heaps (as
is threatened, [Mic 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012).md), yet her
privileges shall be resigned to the spiritual Jerusalem, and in that the
promises made to her shall be fulfilled. Let Jerusalem be easy then,
for, (1.) Her captivity in Babylon shall have an end, a happy end ([Mic
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010).md): There shalt thou be delivered,
and the Lord shall redeem thee from the hand of thy enemies there. This
was done by Cyrus, who acted therein as God's servant; and that
deliverance was typical of our redemption by Jesus Christ, and the
release from our spiritual bondage which is proclaimed in the
everlasting gospel, that acceptable year of the Lord, in which Christ
himself preached liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison
to those that were bound, [Luk 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md),
[Luk 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#019). (2..md) The designs of her
enemies against her afterwards shall be baffled, nay, they shall turn
upon themselves, [Mic 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#012.md), [Mic
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#013.md). They promise themselves a day of
it, but it shall prove God's day. They are gathered against Zion, to
destroy it, but it shall prove to their own destruction, which Israel
and Israel's God shall have the glory of. \[1.\] Their coming together
against Zion shall be the occasion of their ruin. They associate
themselves, and gird themselves, that they may break Jerusalem in
pieces, but it will prove that they shall be broken in pieces, [Isa
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#009.md). They know not the thoughts of the
Lord. When they are gathering together, and Providence favours them in
it, they little think what God is designing by it, nor do they
understand his counsel; they know what they aim at in coming together,
but they know not what God aims at in bringing them together; they aim
at Zion's ruin, but God aims at theirs. Note, When men are made use of
as instruments of Providence in accomplishing its purposes it is very
common for them to intend one thing and for God to intend quite the
contrary. The king of Assyria is to be a rod in God's hand for the
correction of his people, in order to their reformation; howbeit he
means not so, nor does his heart think so, [Isa
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#007.md). And thus it is here; the nations
are gathered against Zion, as soldiers into the field, but God gathers
them as sheaves into the floor, to be beaten to pieces; and they could
not have been so easily, so effectually, destroyed, if they had not
gathered together against Zion. Note, The designs of enemies for the
ruin of the church often prove ruining to themselves; and thereby they
prepare themselves for destruction and put themselves in the way of it;
they are snared in the work of their own hands. \[2.\] Zion shall have
the honour of being victorious over them, [Mic
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#013.md). When they are gathered as
sheaves into the floor, to be trodden down, as the corn then was by the
oxen, then, "Arise, and thresh, O daughter of Zion! instead of fearing
them, and fleeing from them, boldly set upon them, and take the
opportunity Providence favours thee with of trampling upon them. Plead
not thy own weakness, and that thou art not a match for so many
confederated enemies; God will make thy horn iron, to push them down,
and thy hoofs brass, to tread upon them when they are down; and thus
thou shalt beat in pieces many people, that have long been beating thee
in pieces." Thus, when God pleases, the daughter of Babylon is made a
threshing floor (it is time to thresh her, [Jer
51:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#033).md), and the worm Jacob is made a
threshing instrument, with which God will thresh the mountains, and make
them as chaff, [Isa 41:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#014.md), [Isa
41:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#015.md). How strangely, how happily, are
the tables turned, since Jacob was the threshing-floor and Babylon the
threshing instrument! [Isa 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#010.md).
Note, When God has conquering work for his people to do he will furnish
them with strength and ability for it, will make the horn iron and the
hoofs brass; and, when he does so, they must exert the power he gives
them, and execute the commission; even the daughter of Zion must arise,
and thresh. \[3.\] The glory of the victory shall redound to God. Zion
shall thresh these sheaves in the floor, but the corn threshed out shall
be a meat-offering at God's altar: I will consecrate their gain unto the
Lord (that is, I will have it consecrated) and their substance unto the
Lord of the whole earth. The spoils gained by Zion's victory shall be
brought into the sanctuary, and devoted to God, either in part, as those
of Midian ([Num 31:28](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#028).md), or in whole,
as those of Jericho, [Jos 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#017.md). God is
Jehovah, the fountain of being; he is the Lord of the whole earth, the
fountain of power; and therefore he needs not any of our gain or
substance, but may challenge and demand it all if he please; and with
ourselves we must devote all we have to his honour, to be employed as he
directs. Thus far all we have must have holiness to the Lord written
upon it, all our gain and substance must be consecrated to the Lord of
the whole earth, [Isa 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#018.md). And
extraordinary successes call for extraordinary acknowledgments, whether
they be of spoils in war or gains in trade. It is God that gives us
power to get wealth, which way soever it is honestly got, and therefore
he must be honoured with what we get. Some make all this to point at the
defeat of Sennacherib when he besieged Jerusalem, others to the
destruction of Babylon, others to the successes of the Maccabees; but
the learned Dr. Pocock and others think it had its full accomplishment
in the spiritual victories obtained by the gospel of Christ over the
powers of darkness that fought against it. The nations thought to ruin
Christianity in its infancy, but it was victorious over them; those that
persisted in their enmity were broken to pieces ([Mat
21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044).md), particularly the Jewish
nation; but multitudes by divine grace were gained to the church, and
they and their substance were consecrated to the Lord Jesus, the Lord of
the whole earth.
