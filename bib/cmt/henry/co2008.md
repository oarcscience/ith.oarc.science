### [2 Corinthians Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">co2 8:0</span></span>

In this and the following chapter Paul is exhorting and directing the
Corinthians about a particular work of charity - to relieve the
necessities of the poor saints at Jerusalem and in Judea, according to
the good example of the churches in Macedonia, [Rom
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#026.md). The Christians at Jerusalem,
through war, famine, and persecution, had become poor, many of them had
fallen into decay, and perhaps most of them were but poor when they
first embraced Christianity; for Christ said, "The poor receive the
gospel." Now Paul, though he was the apostle of the Gentiles, had a
fonder regard, and kind concern, for those among the Jews who were
converted to the Christian faith; and, though many of them had not so
much affection to the Gentile converts as they ought to have had, yet
the apostle would have the Gentiles to be kind to them, and stirred them
up to contribute liberally for their relief. Upon this subject he is
very copious, and writes very affectingly. In this eighth chapter he
acquaints the Corinthians with, and commends, the good example of the
Macedonians in this work of charity, and that Titus was sent to Corinth
to collect their bounty ([Co2 8:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001).md).
He the proceeds to urge this duty with several cogent arguments ([Co2
8:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#007).md), and commends the persons who
were employed in this affair ([Co2
8:16-24](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#016).md).

[2 Corinthians 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 8:1</span></span>

Observe here,

I. The apostle takes occasion from the good example of the churches of
Macedonia, that is, of Philippi, Thessalonica, Berea, and others in the
region of Macedonia, to exhort the Corinthians and the Christians in
Achaia to the good work of charity. And,

1\. He acquaints them with their great liberality, which he calls the
grace of God bestowed on the churches, [Co2
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001.md). Some think the words should be
rendered, the gift of God given in or by the churches. He certainly
means the charitable gifts of these churches, which are called the grace
or gifts of God, either because they were very large, or rather because
their charity to the poor saints did proceed from God as the author, and
was accompanied with true love to God, which also was manifested this
way. The grace of God must be owned as the root and fountain of all the
good that is in us, or done by us, at any time; and it is great grace
and favour from God, and bestowed on us, if we are made useful to
others, and are forward to any good work.

2\. He commends the charity of the Macedonians, and sets it forth with
good advantage. He tells them, (1.) They were but in a low condition,
and themselves in distress, yet they contributed to the relief of
others. They were in great tribulation and deep poverty, [Co2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#002.md). It was a time of great affliction
with them, as may be seen, [Act 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#017.md).
The Christians in these parts met with ill treatment, which had reduced
them to deep poverty; yet, as they had abundance of joy in the midst of
tribulation, they abounded in their liberality; they gave out of a
little, trusting in God to provide for them, and make it up to them.
(2.) They gave very largely, with the riches of liberality ([Co2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#002).md), that is, as liberally as if they
had been rich. It was a large contribution they made, all things
considered; it was according to, yea beyond, their power ([Co2
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#003).md), as much as could well be
expected from them, if not more. Note, Though men may condemn the
indiscretion, yet God will accept the pious zeal, of those who in real
works of piety and charity do rather beyond their power. (3.) They were
very ready and forward to this good work. They were willing of
themselves ([Co2 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#003).md), and were so far
from needing that Paul should urge and press them with many arguments
that they prayed him with much entreaty to receive the gift, [Co2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#004.md). It seems Paul was backward to
undertake this trust, for he would give himself to the word and prayer;
or, it may be, he was apprehensive how ready his enemies would be to
reproach and blacken him upon all occasions, and might take a handle
against him upon account of so large a sum deposited in his hands, to
suspect or accuse him of indiscretion and partiality in the
distribution, if not of some injustice. Note, How cautious ministers
should be, especially in money-matters, not to give occasion to those
who seek occasion to speak reproachfully! (4.) Their charity was founded
in true piety, and this was the great commendation of it. They performed
this good work in a right method: First they gave themselves to the
Lord, and then they gave unto us their contributions, by the will of God
([Co2 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#005).md), that is, according as it
was the will of God they should do, or to be disposed of as the will of
God should be, and for his glory. This, it seems, exceeded the
expectation of the apostle; it was more than he hoped for, to see such
warm and pious affections shining in these Macedonians, and this good
work performed with so much devotion and solemnity. They solemnly,
jointly, and unanimously, made a fresh surrender of themselves, and all
they had, unto the Lord Jesus Christ. They had done this before, and now
they do it again upon this occasion; sanctifying their contributions to
God's honour, by first giving themselves to the Lord. Note, \[1.\] We
should give ourselves to God; we cannot bestow ourselves better. \[2.\]
When we give ourselves to the Lord, we then give him all we have, to be
called for and disposed of according to his will. \[3.\] Whatever we use
or lay out for God, it is only giving to him what is his own. \[4.\]
What we give or bestow for charitable uses will not be accepted of God,
nor turn to our advantage, unless we first give ourselves to the Lord.

II\. The apostle tells them that Titus was desired to go and make a
collection among them ([Co2 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#006).md), and
Titus, he knew, would be an acceptable person to them. He had met with a
kind reception among them formerly. They had shown good affection to
him, and he had a great love for them. Besides, Titus had already begun
this work among them, therefore he was desired to finish it. So that he
was, on all accounts, a proper person to be employed; and, when so good
a work had already prospered in so good a hand, it would be a pity if it
should not proceed and be finished. Note, It is an instance of wisdom to
use proper instruments in a work we desire to do well; and the work of
charity will often succeed the best when the most proper persons are
employed to solicit contributions and dispose of them.

[2 Corinthians 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 8:7</span></span>

In these verses the apostle uses several cogent arguments to stir up the
Corinthians to this good work of charity.

I. He urges upon them the consideration of their eminence in other gifts
and graces, and would have them excel in this of charity also, [Co2
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#007.md). Great address and much holy art
are here used by the apostle. When he would persuade the Corinthians to
this good thing, he commends them for other good things that were found
in them. Most people love to be complimented, especially when we ask a
gift of them for ourselves or others; and it is a justice we owe to
those in whom God's grace shines to give them their due commendation.
Observe here, What it was that the Corinthians abounded in. Faith is
mentioned first, for that is the root; and, as without faith it is
impossible to please God ([Heb 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006).md),
so those who abound in faith will abound in other graces and good works
also; and this will work and show itself by love. To their faith was
added utterance, which is an excellent gift, and redounds much to the
glory of God and the good of the church. Many have faith who want
utterance. But these Corinthians excelled most churches in spiritual
gifts, and particularly in utterance; and yet this was not in them, as
in too many, both the effect and evidence of ignorance; for with their
utterance there appeared knowledge, abundance of knowledge. They had a
treasury of things new and old, and in their utterance they brought out
of this treasury. They abounded also in all diligence. Those who have
great knowledge and ready utterance are not always the most diligent
Christians. Great talkers are not always the best doers; but these
Corinthians were diligent to do, as well as know and talk, well. And
further, they had abundant love to their minister; and were not like too
many, who, having gifts of their own, are but too apt to slight their
ministers, and neglect them. Now to all these good things the apostle
desires them to add this grace also, to abound in charity to the poor;
that, where so much good was found, there should be found yet more good.
Before the apostle proceeds to another argument he takes care to prevent
any misapprehensions of his design to impose on them, or to bind heavy
burdens upon them by his authority; and tells them ([Co2
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#008).md) he does not speak by commandment,
or in a way of authority. I give my advice, [Co2
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#010.md). He took occasion from the
forwardness of others to propose what would be expedient for them, and
would prove the sincerity of their love, or be the genuine effect and
evidence thereof. Note, A great difference should be made between plain
and positive duty, and the improvement of a present opportunity of doing
or getting good. Many a thing which is good for us to do, yet can not be
said to be, by express and indispensable commandment, our duty at this
or that time.

II\. Another argument is taken from the consideration of the grace of
our Lord Jesus Christ. The best arguments for Christian duties are those
that are taken from the love of Christ, that constraineth us. The
example of the churches of Macedonia was such as the Corinthians should
imitate; but the example of our Lord Jesus Christ should have much
greater influence. And you know, saith the apostle, the grace of our
Lord Jesus Christ ([Co2 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009).md), that
though he was rich, as being God, equal in power and glory with the
Father, rich in all the glory and blessedness of the upper world, yet
for your sakes he became poor; not only did become man for us, but he
became poor also. He was born in poor circumstances, lived a poor life,
and died in poverty; and this was for our sakes, that we thereby might
be made rich, rich in the love and favour of God, rich in the blessings
and promises of the new covenant, rich in the hopes of eternal life,
being heirs of the kingdom. This is a good reason why we should be
charitable to the poor out of what we have, because we ourselves live
upon the charity of the Lord Jesus Christ.

III\. Another argument is taken from their good purposes, and their
forwardness to begin this good work. As to this he tells them, 1. It was
expedient for them to perform what they purposed, and finish what they
had begun, [Co2 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#010.md), [Co2
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#011.md). What else did their good
purposes and good beginnings signify? Good purposes, indeed, are good
things; they are like buds and blossoms, pleasant to behold, and give
hopes of good fruit; but they are lost, and signify nothing, without
performances. So good beginnings are amiable; but we shall lose the
benefit unless there be perseverance, and we bring forth fruit to
perfection. Seeing therefore the Corinthians had shown a readiness to
will, he would have them be careful also in the performance, according
to their ability. For, 2. This would be acceptable to God. This willing
mind is accepted ([Co2 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#012).md), when
accompanied with sincere endeavours. When men purpose that which is
good, and endeavour, according to their ability, to perform also, God
will accept of what they have, or can do, and not reject them for what
they have not, and what is not in their power to do: and this is true as
to other things besides the work of charity. But let us note here that
this scripture will by no means justify those who think good meanings
are enough, or that good purposes, and the profession of a willing mind,
are sufficient to save them. It is accepted, indeed, where there is a
performance as far as we are able, and when Providence hinders the
performance, as in David's case concerning building a house for the
Lord, 2 Sa. 7.

IV\. Another argument is taken from the discrimination which the divine
Providence makes in the distribution of the things of this world, and
the mutability of human affairs, [Co2
8:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#013.md). The force of the arguing
seems to be this: - Providence gives to some more of the good things of
this world, and to some less, and that with this design, that those who
have a greater abundance may supply those who are in want, that there
may be room for charity. And further, considering the mutability of
human affairs, and how soon there may be an alteration, so that those
who now have an abundance may stand in need of being supplied themselves
in their wants, this should induce them to be charitable while they are
able. It is the will of God that, by our mutually supplying one another,
there should be some sort of equality; not an absolute equality indeed,
or such a levelling as would destroy property, for in such a case there
could be no exercise of charity. But as in works of charity there should
be an equitable proportion observed, that the burden should not lie too
heavy on some, while others are wholly eased, so all should think
themselves concerned to supply those who are in want. This is
illustrated by the instance of gathering and distributing manna in the
wilderness, concerning which (as we may read, Ex. 16) it was the duty of
every family, and all in the family, to gather what they could, which,
when it was gathered, was put into some common receptacle for each
family, whence the master of the family distributed to every one as he
had occasion, to some more than they were able, through age and
infirmity, to gather up; to others less than they gathered, because they
did not need so much: and thus he that had gathered much (more than he
had occasion for) had nothing over, when a communication was made to him
that had gathered little, who by this method had no lack. Note, Such is
the condition of men in this world that we mutually depend on one
another, and should help one another. Those who have ever so much of
this world have no more than food and raiment; and those who have but a
little of this world seldom want these; nor, indeed, should those who
have abundance suffer others to want, but be ready to afford supply.

[2 Corinthians 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 8:16</span></span>

In these verses the apostle commends the brethren who were sent to them
to collect their charity; and as it were, gives them letters credential,
that, if they were enquired after ([Co2
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#023).md), if any should be inquisitive or
suspicious concerning them, it might be known who they were and how
safely they might be trusted.

I. He commends Titus, 1. For his earnest care and great concern of heart
for them, and desire in all things to promote their welfare. This is
mentioned with thankfulness to God ([Co2
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#016).md), and it is cause of thankfulness
if God hath put it into the hearts of any to do us or others any good.
2. For his readiness to this present service. He accepted the office,
and was forward to go upon this good errand, [Co2
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#017.md). Asking charity for the relief of
others is by many looked upon as a thankless office; yet it is a good
office, and what we should not be shy of when we are called to it.

II\. He commends another brother, who was sent with Titus. It is
generally thought that this was Luke. He is commended, 1. As a man whose
praise was in the gospel through all the churches, [Co2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#018.md). His ministerial services of
several kinds were well known, and he had approved himself praiseworthy
in what he had done. 2. As one chosen of the churches ([Co2
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#019).md) and joined with the apostle in
his ministration. This was done, it is most likely, at the motion and
request of Paul himself; for this reason, that no man might blame him in
that abundance which was administered by him ([Co2
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#020).md), so cautious was the apostle to
avoid all occasions that evil-minded men might lay hold on to blacken
him. He would not give occasion to any to accuse him of injustice or
partiality in this affair, and thought it to be his duty, as it is the
duty of all Christians, to provide for things honest, not only in the
sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men; that is, to act so
prudently as to prevent, as far as we can, all unjust suspicions
concerning us, and all occasions of scandalous imputations. Note, We
live in a censorious world, and should cut off occasion from those who
seek occasion to speak reproachfully. It is the crime of others if they
reproach or censure us without occasion; and it is our imprudence at
least if we give them any occasion, when there may not be a just cause
for them so to do.

III\. He commends also another brother who was joined with the two
former in this affair. This brother is thought to be Apollos. Whoever he
was, he had approved himself diligent in many things; and therefore was
fit to be employed in this affair. Moreover, he had great desire to this
work, because of the confidence or good opinion he had of the
Corinthians ([Co2 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#022).md), and it is a
great comfort to see those employed in good works who have formerly
approved themselves diligent.

IV\. He concludes this point with a general good character of them all
([Co2 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#023).md), as fellow-labourers with
him for their welfare; as the messengers of the churches; as the glory
of Christ, who were to him for a name and a praise, who brought glory to
Christ as instruments and had obtained honour from Christ to be counted
faithful and employed in his service. Wherefore, upon the whole, he
exhorts them to show their liberality, answerable to the great
expectation others had concerning them at this time, that these
messengers of the churches, and the churches themselves, might see a
full proof of their love to God and to their afflicted brethren, and
that it was with good reason the apostle had even boasted on their
behalf, [Co2 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#024.md). Note, The good
opinion others entertain of us should be an argument with us to do well.
