### [Deuteronomy Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 12:0</span></span>

Moses at this chapter comes to the particular statues which he had to
give in charge to Israel, and he begins with those which relate to the
worship of God, and particularly those which explain the second
commandment, about which God is in a special manner jealous. I. They
must utterly destroy all relics and remains of idolatry ([Deu
12:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#001).md). II. They must keep close to
the tabernacle ([Deu 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#004.md), [Deu
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005).md). The former precept was intended
to prevent all false worship, the latter to preserve the worship God had
instituted. By this latter law, 1. They are commanded to bring all their
offerings to the altar of God, and all their holy things to the place
which he should choose ([Deu 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#006.md),
[Deu 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#007.md), [Deu
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#011.md), [Deu
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#012.md), [Deu
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#014.md), [Deu
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#018.md), [Deu
12:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#026).md). 2. They are forbidden, in
general, to do as they now did in the wilderness ([Deu
12:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#008).md), and as the Canaanites had
done ([Deu 12:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#029).md), and, in
particular, to eat the hallowed things at their own houses ([Deu
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#013.md), [Deu
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#017.md), [Deu
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#018).md), or to forsake the instituted
ministry ([Deu 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#019).md). 3. They are
permitted to eat flesh as common food at their own houses, provided they
do not eat the blood ([Deu 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#015.md), [Deu
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#016.md), and again, [Deu
12:20-26](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#020).md).

[Deuteronomy 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 12:1</span></span>

From those great original truths, That there is a God, and that there is
but one God, arise those great fundamental laws, That that God is to be
worshipped, and he only, and that therefore we are to have no other God
before him: this is the first commandment, and the second is a guard
upon it, or a hedge about it. To prevent a revolt to false gods, we are
forbidden to worship the true God in such a way and manner as the false
gods were worshipped in, and are commanded to observe the instituted
ordinances of worship that we may adhere to the proper object of
worship. For this reason Moses is very large in his exposition of the
second commandment. What is contained in this and the four following
chapters mostly refers to that. These are statutes and judgments which
they must observe to do ([Deu 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#001).md),
1. In the days of their rest and prosperity, when they should be masters
of Canaan. We must not think that our religion is instituted only to be
our work in the years of our servitude, our entertainment in the places
of our solitude, and our consolation in affliction; no, when we come to
possess a good land, still we must keep up the worship of God in Canaan
as well as in a wilderness, when we have grown up as well as when we are
children, when we are full of business as well as when we have nothing
else to do. 2. All the days, as long as you live upon the earth. While
we are here in our state of trial, we must continue in our obedience,
even to the end, and never leave our duty, nor grow weary of well-doing.
Now,

I. They are here charged to abolish and extirpate all those things that
the Canaanites had served their idol-gods with, [Deu
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#002.md), [Deu
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#003.md). Here is no mention of
idol-temples, which countenances the opinion some have, that the
tabernacle Moses reared in the wilderness was the first habitation that
ever was made for religious uses, and that from it temples took their
rise. But the places that had been used, and were now to be levelled,
were enclosures for their worship on mountains and hills (as if the
height of the ground would give advantage to the ascent of their
devotions), and under green trees, either because pleasant or because
awful: whatever makes the mind easy and reverent, contracts and composes
it, was thought to befriend devotion. The solemn shade and silence of a
grove are still admired by those that are disposed to contemplation. But
the advantage which these retirements gave to the Gentiles in the
worship of their idols was that they concealed those works of darkness
which could not bear the light; and therefore they must all be
destroyed, with the altars, pillars, and images, that had been used by
the natives in the worship of their gods, so as that the very names of
them might be buried in oblivion, and not only not be remembered with
respect, but not remembered at all. They must thus consult, 1. The
reputation of their land; let it never be said of this holy land that it
had been thus polluted, but let all these dunghills be carried away, as
things they were ashamed of. 2. The safety of their religion; let none
be left remaining, lest profane unthinking people, especially in
degenerate ages, should make use of them in the service of the God of
Israel. Let these pest-houses be demolished, as things they were afraid
of. He begins the statutes that relate to divine worship with this,
because there must first be an abhorrence of that which is evil before
there can be a steady adherence to that which is good, [Rom
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#009.md). The kingdom of God must be set
up, both in persons and places, upon the ruins of the devil's kingdom;
for they cannot stand together, nor can there be any communion between
Christ and Belial.

II\. They are charged not to transfer the rites and usages of idolaters
into he worship of God; no, not under colour of beautifying and
improving it ([Deu 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#004).md): You shall
not do so to the Lord your god, that is, "you must not think to do
honour to him by offering sacrifices on mountains and hills, erecting
pillars, planting groves, and setting up images; no, you must not
indulge a luxurious fancy in your worship, nor think that whatever
pleases that will please God: he is above all gods, and will not be
worshipped as other gods are."

[Deuteronomy 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 12:5</span></span>

There is not any one particular precept (as I remember) in all the law
of Moses so largely pressed and inculcated as this, by which they are
all tied to bring their sacrifices to that one altar which was set up in
the court of the tabernacle, and there to perform all the rituals of
their religion; for, as to moral services, then, no doubt, as now, men
might pray every where, as they did in their synagogues. The command to
do this, and the prohibition of the contrary, are here repeated again
and again, as we teach children: and yet we are sure that there is in
scripture no vain repetition; but all this stress is laid upon it, 1.
Because of the strange proneness there was in the hearts of the people
to idolatry and superstition, and the danger of their being seduced by
the many temptations which they would be surrounded with. 2. Because of
the great use which the observance of this appointment would be of to
them, both to prevent the introducing of corrupt customs into their
worship and to preserve among them unity and brotherly love, that,
meeting all in one place, they might continue both of one way and of one
heart. 3. Because of the significancy of this appointment. They must
keep to one place, in token of their belief of those two great truths,
which we find together ([Ti1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005).md),
That there is one God, and one Mediator between God and man. It not only
served to keep up the notion of the unity of the Godhead, but was an
intimation to them (though they could not stedfastly discern it) of the
one only way of approach to God and communion with him, in and by the
Messiah.

Let us now reduce this long charge to its proper heads.

I. It is here promised that when they were settled in Canaan, when they
had rest from their enemies, and dwelt in safety, God would choose a
certain place, which he would appoint to be the centre of their unity,
to which they should bring all their offerings, [Deu
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#010.md), [Deu
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#011.md). Observe, 1. If they just be
tied to one place, they should not be left in doubt concerning it, but
should certainly know what place it was. Had Christ intended, under the
gospel, to make any one place such a seat of power as Rome pretends to
be, we should not have been left so destitute of instruction as we are
concerning the appointed place. 2. God does not leave it to them to
choose the place, lest the tribes should have quarrelled about it, each
striving, for their secular advantage, to have it among them; but he
reserves the choice to himself, as he does the designation of the
Redeemer and the institution of holy ordinances. 3. He does not appoint
the place now, as he had appointed mounts Gerizim and Ebal, for the
pronouncing of the blessings and curses ([Deu
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#029).md), but reserves the doing of it
till hereafter, that hereby they might be made to expect further
directions from heaven, and a divine conduct, after Moses should be
removed. The place which God would choose is said to be the place where
he would put his name, that is, which he would have to be called his,
where his honour should dwell, where he would manifest himself to his
people, and make himself known, as men do by their names, and where he
would receive addresses, by which his name is both praised and called
upon. It was to be his habitation, where, as King of Israel, he would
keep court, and be found by all those that reverently sought him. The
ark was the token of God's presence, and where that was put there God
put his name, and that was his habitation. It contained the tables of
the law; for none must expect to receive favours from God's hand but
those that are willing to receive the law from his mouth. The place
which God first chose for the ark to reside in was Shiloh; and, after
that place had sinned away its honours, we find the ark at
Kirjath-jearim and other places; but at length, in David's time, it was
fixed at Jerusalem, and God said concerning Solomon's temple, more
expressly than ever he had said concerning any other place, This I have
chosen for a house of sacrifice, [Ch2
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#012.md). Compare [Ch2
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#005.md). Now, under the gospel, we have no
temple that sanctifies the gold, no altar that sanctifies the gift, but
Christ only; and, as to the places of worship, the prophets foretold
that in every place the spiritual incense should be offered, [Mal
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011.md). And our Saviour has declared
that those are accepted as true worshippers who worship God in sincerity
and truth, without regard either to this mountain or Jerusalem, [Joh
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#023.md).

II\. They are commanded to bring all their burnt-offerings and
sacrifices to this place that God would choose ([Deu
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#006.md) and again [Deu
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#011).md): Thither shall you bring all
that I command you; and ([Deu 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#014).md),
There thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings; and ([Deu
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#027).md), The flesh and the blood must
be offered upon the altar of the Lord thy God. And of their
peace-offerings, here called their sacrifices, though they were to eat
the flesh, yet the blood was to be poured out upon the altar. By this
they were taught that sacrifices and offerings God did not desire, nor
accept, for their own sake, nor for any intrinsic worth in them, as
natural expressions of homage and adoration; but that they received
their virtue purely from that altar on which they were offered, as it
typified Christ; whereas prayers and praises, as much more necessary and
valuable, were to be offered every day by the people of God wherever
they were. A devout Israelite might honour God, and keep up communion
with him, and obtain mercy from him, though he had not an opportunity,
perhaps, for many months together, of bringing a sacrifice to his altar.
But this signified the obligation we Christians are under to offer up
all our spiritual sacrifices to God in the name of Jesus Christ, hoping
for acceptance only upon the score of his mediation, [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md).

III\. They are commanded to feast upon their hallowed things before the
Lord, with holy joy. They must not only bring to the altar the
sacrifices which were to be offered to God, but hey must bring to the
place of the altar all those things which they were appointed by the law
to eat and drink, to the honour of God, in token of their communion with
him, [Deu 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#006.md). Their, tithes, and
heave-offerings of their hand, that is, their first-fruits, their vows,
and free-will-offerings, and firstlings, all those things which were to
be religiously made use of either by themselves or by the priests and
Levites, must be brought to the place which God would choose; as all the
revenues of the crown, from all parts of the kingdom, are brought into
the exchequer. And ([Deu 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#007).md): There
you shall eat before the Lord, and rejoice in all that you put your
hands unto; and again ([Deu 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#012).md),
You shall rejoice before the Lord, you, and your sons, and your
daughters. Observe here, 1. That what we do in the service of God and to
his glory redounds to our benefit, if it be not our own fault. Those
that sacrifice to God are welcome to eat before him, and to feast upon
their sacrifices: he sups with us, and we with him, [Rev
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#020.md). If we glorify God, we edify
ourselves, and cultivate our own minds, through the grace of God, by the
increase of our knowledge and faith, the enlivening of devout
affections, and the confirming of gracious habits and resolutions: thus
is the soul nourished. 2. That work for God should be done with holy joy
and cheerfulness. You shall eat and rejoice, [Deu
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#007.md), and again, [Deu
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#012.md) and [Deu
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#018). (1..md) Now while they were before
the Lord they must rejoice, [Deu
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#012.md). It is the will of God that we
should serve him with gladness; none displeased him more than those that
covered his altar with tears. [Mal
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#013.md). See what a good Master we serve,
who has made it our duty to sing at our work. Even the children and
servants must rejoice with them before God, that the services of
religion might be a pleasure to them, and not a task or drudgery. (2.)
They must carry away with them the grateful relish of that delight which
they found in communion with God; they must rejoice in all that they put
their hands unto, [Deu 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#007.md). Some of
the comfort which they must take with them into their common
employments; and, being thus strengthened in soul, whatever they did
they must do it heartily and cheerfully. And this holy pious joy in God
and his goodness, with which we are to rejoice evermore, would be the
best preservative against the sin and snare of vain and carnal mirth and
a relief against the sorrows of the world.

IV\. They are commanded to be kind to the Levites. Did they feast with
joy? The Levites must feast with them, and rejoice with them, [Deu
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#012.md), and again, [Deu
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#018.md); and a general caution ([Deu
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#019).md), Take heed that thou forsake
not the Levite as long as thou livest. There were Levites that attended
the altar as assistants to the priests, and these must not be forsaken,
that is, the service they performed must be constantly adhered to; no
other altar must be set up than that which God appointed; for that would
be to forsake the Levites. But this seems to be spoken of the Levites
that were dispersed in the country to instruct the people in the law of
God, and to assist them in their devotions; for it is the Levite within
their gates that they are here commanded to make much of. It is a great
mercy to have Levites near us, within our gates, that we may ask the law
at their mouth, and at our feasts to be a check upon us, to restrain
excesses. And it is the duty of people to be kind to their ministers
that give them good instructions and set them good examples. As long as
we live we shall need their assistance, till we come to that world where
ordinances will be superseded; and therefore as long as we live we must
not forsake the Levites. The reason given ([Deu
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#012).md) is because the Levite has no
part nor inheritance with you, so that he cannot grow rich by husbandry
or trade; let him therefore share with you in the comfort of your
riches. They must give the Levites their tithes and offerings, settled
on them by the law, because they had no other maintenance.

V. They are allowed to eat common flesh, but not the flesh of their
offerings, in their own houses, wherever they dwelt. What was any way
devoted to God they must not eat at home, [Deu
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#013.md), [Deu
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#017.md). But what was not so devoted
they might kill and eat of at their pleasure, [Deu
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#015.md). And this permission is again
repeated, [Deu 12:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#020.md). It should
seem that while they were in the wilderness they did not eat the flesh
of any of those kinds of beasts that were used in sacrifice, but what
was killed at the door of the tabernacle, and part of it presented to
God as a peace-offering, [Lev 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#003.md),
[Lev 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#004.md). But when they came to
Canaan, where they must live at a great distance from the tabernacle,
they might kill what they pleased for their own use of their flocks and
herds, without bringing part to the altar. This allowance is very
express, and repeated, lest Satan should take occasion from that law
which forbade the eating of their sacrifices at their own houses to
suggest to them, as he did to our first parents, hard thoughts of God,
as if he grudged them: Thou mayest eat whatsoever thy soul lusteth
after. There is a natural regular appetite, which it is lawful to
gratify with temperance and sobriety, not taking too great a pleasure in
the gratification, nor being uneasy if it be crossed. The unclean, who
might not eat of the holy things, yet might eat of the same sort of
flesh when it was only used as common food. The distinction between
clean persons and unclean was sacred, and designed for the preserving of
the honour of their holy feasts, and therefore must not be brought into
their ordinary meals. This permission has a double restriction: - 1.
They must eat according to the blessing which God had given them, [Deu
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#015.md). Note, It is not only our
wisdom, but our duty, to live according to our estates, and not to spend
above what we have. As it is unjust on the one hand to hoard what should
be laid out, so it is much more unjust to lay out more than we have; for
what is not our own must needs be another's, who is thereby robbed and
defrauded. And this, I say, is much more unjust, because it is easier
afterwards to distribute what has been unduly spared, and so to make a
sort of restitution for the wrong, than it is to repay to wife, and
children, and creditors, what has been unduly spent. Between these two
extremes let wisdom find the mean, and then let watchfulness and
resolution keep it. 2. They must not eat blood ([Deu
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#016.md), and again, [Deu
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#023).md): Only be sure that thou eat not
the blood ([Deu 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#024).md), Thou shalt not
eat it; and ([Deu 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#025).md), Thou shalt
not eat it, that it may go well with thee. When they could not bring the
blood to the altar, to pour it out there before the Lord, as belonging
to him, they must pour it out upon the earth, as not belonging to them,
because it was the life, and therefore, as an acknowledgment, belonged
to him who gives life, and, as an atonement, belonged to him to whom
life is forfeited. Bishop Patrick thinks one reason why they were
forbidden thus strictly the eating of blood was to prevent the
superstitions of the old idolaters about the blood of their sacrifices,
which they thought their demons delighted in, and by eating of which
they imagined that they had communion with them.

VI\. They are forbidden to keep up either their own corrupt usages in
the wilderness or the corrupt usages of their predecessors in the land
of Canaan.

1\. They must not keep up those improper customs which they had got into
in the wilderness, and which were connived at in consideration of the
present unsettledness of their condition ([Deu
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#008.md), [Deu
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#009).md): You shall not do after all the
things that we do here this day. Never was there a better governor than
Moses, and one would think never a better opportunity of keeping up good
order and discipline than now among the people of Israel, when they lay
so closely encamped under the eye of their governor; and yet it seems
there was much amiss and many irregularities had crept in among them. We
must never expect to see any society perfectly pure and right, and as it
should be till we come to the heavenly Canaan. They had sacrifices and
religious worship, courts of justice and civil government, and, by the
stoning of the man that gathered sticks on the sabbath day, it appears
there was great strictness used in guarding the most weighty matters of
the law; but being frequently upon the remove, and always at
uncertainty, (1.) They could none of them observe the solemn feasts, and
the rites of cleansing, with the exactness that the law required. And,
(2.) Those among them that were disposed to do amiss had opportunity
given them to do it unobserved by the frequent interruptions which their
removals gave to the administration of justice. But (says Moses) when
you come to Canaan, you shall not do as we do here. Note, When the
people of God are in an unsettled condition, that may be tolerated and
dispensed with which would by no means be allowed at another time. Cases
of necessity are to be considered while the necessity continues; but
that must not be done in Canaan which was done in the wilderness. While
a house is in the building a great deal of dirt and rubbish are suffered
to lie by it, which must all be taken away when the house is built.
Moses was now about to lay down his life and government, and it was a
comfort to him to foresee that Israel would be better in the next reign
than they had been in his.

2\. They must not worship the Lord by any of those rites or ceremonies
which the notions of Canaan had made use of in the service of their
gods, [Deu 12:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#029.md). They must not so
much as enquire into the modes and forms of idolatrous worship. What
good would it do to them to know those depths of Satan? [Rev
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#024.md). It is best to be ignorant of
that which there is danger of being infected by. They must not introduce
the customs of idolaters, (1.) Because it would be absurd to make those
their patterns whom God had made their slaves and captives, cut off, and
destroyed from before them. The Canaanites had not flourished and
prospered so much in the service of their gods as that the Israelites
should be invited to take up their customs. Those are wretchedly
besotted indeed who will walk in the way of sinners, after they have
seen their end. (2.) Because some of their customs were most barbarous
and inhuman, and such as trampled, not only upon the light and law of
nature, but upon natural affection itself, as burning their sons and
their daughters in the fire to their gods ([Deu
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#031).md), the very mention of which is
sufficient to make it odious, and possess us with a horror of it. (3.)
Because their idolatrous customs were an abomination to the Lord, and
the translating of them into his worship would make even that an
abomination and an affront to him by which they should give him honour,
and by which they hoped to obtain his favour. The case is bad indeed
when the sacrifice itself has become an abomination, [Pro
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#008.md). He therefore concludes ([Deu
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#032).md) with the same caution
concerning the worship of God which he had before given concerning the
word of God ([Deu 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#002).md): "You shall not
add thereto any inventions of your own, under pretence of making the
ordinance either more significant or more magnificent, nor diminish from
it, under pretence of making it more easy and practicable, or of setting
aside that which may be spared; but observe to do all that, and that
only, which God has commanded." We may then hope in our religious
worship to obtain the divine acceptance when we observe the divine
appointment. God will have his own work done in his own way.
