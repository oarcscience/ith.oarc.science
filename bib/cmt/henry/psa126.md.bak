### [Psalms Chapter 126](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 126:0</span></span>

It was with reference to some great and surprising deliverance of the
people of God out of bondage and distress that this psalm was penned,
most likely their return out of Babylon in Ezra's time. Though Babylon
be not mentioned here (as it is, [Psa
137:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001).md) yet their captivity there was
the most remarkable captivity both in itself and as their return out of
it was typical of our redemption by Christ. Probably this psalm was
penned by Ezra, or some of the prophets that came up with the first. We
read of singers of the children of Asaph, that famous psalmist, who
returned then, [Ezr 2:41](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#041.md). It being a
song of ascents, in which the same things are twice repeated with
advancement ([Psa 126:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#002.md), [Psa
126:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#003.md), and [Psa
126:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#004.md), [Psa
126:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#005).md), it is put here among the rest
of the psalms that bear that title. I. Those that had returned out of
captivity are here called upon to be thankful ([Psa
126:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001).md). II. Those that were yet
remaining in captivity are here prayed for ([Psa
126:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#004).md) and encouraged ([Psa
126:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#005.md), [Psa
126:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#006).md). It will be easy, in singing
this psalm, to apply it either to any particular deliverance wrought for
the church or our own land or to the great work of our salvation by
Christ.

A song of degrees.

[Psalms 126:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 126:1</span></span>

While the people of Israel were captives in Babylon their harps were
hung upon the willow-trees, for then God called to weeping and mourning,
then he mourned unto them and they lamented; but now that their
captivity is turned they resume their harps; Providence pipes to them,
and they dance. Thus must we accommodate ourselves to all the
dispensations of Providence and be suitably affected with them. And the
harps are never more melodiously tunable than after such a melancholy
disuse. The long want of mercies greatly sweetens their return. Here is,
1. The deliverance God has wrought for them: He turned again the
captivity of Zion. It is possible that Zion may be in captivity for the
punishment of her degeneracy, but her captivity shall be turned again
when the end is answered and the work designed by it is effected. Cyrus,
for reasons of state, proclaimed liberty to God's captives, and yet it
was the Lord's doing, according to his word many years before. God sent
them into captivity, not as dross is put into the fire to be consumed,
but as gold to be refined. Observe, The release of Israel is called the
turning again of the captivity of Zion, the holy hill, where God's
tabernacle and dwelling-place were; for the restoring of their sacred
interests, and the reviving of the public exercise of their religion,
were the most valuable advantages of their return out of captivity. 2.
The pleasing surprise that this was to them. They were amazed at it; it
came so suddenly that at first they were in confusion, not knowing what
to make of it, nor what it was tending to: "We thought ourselves like
men that dream; we thought it too good news to be true, and began to
question whether we were well awake or no, and whether it was not still"
(as sometimes it had been to the prophets) "only a representation of it
in vision," as St. Peter for a while thought his deliverance was, [Act
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#009.md). Sometimes the people of God are
thus prevented with the blessings of his goodness before they are aware.
We were like those that are recovered to health (so Dr. Hammond reads
it); "such a comfortable happy change it was to us, as life from the
dead or sudden ease from exquisite pain; we thought ourselves in a new
world." And the surprise of it put them into such an ecstasy and
transport of joy that they could scarcely contain themselves within the
bounds of decency in the expressions of it: Our mouth was filled with
laughter and our tongue with singing. Thus they gave vent to their joy,
gave glory to their God, and gave notice to all about them what wonders
God had wrought for them. Those that were laughed at now laugh and a new
song is put into their mouths. It was a laughter of joy in God, not
scorn of their enemies. 3. The notice which their neighbours took of it:
They said among the heathen, Jehovah, the God of Israel, has done great
things for that people, such as our gods cannot do for us. The heathen
had observed their calamity and had triumphed in it, [Jer
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#008.md), [Jer
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#009.md); [Psa
137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007.md). Now they could not but observe
their deliverance and admire that. It put a reputation upon those that
had been scorned and despised, and made them look considerable; besides,
it turned greatly to the honour of God, and extorted from those that set
up other gods in competition with him an acknowledgment of his wisdom,
power, and providence. 4. The acknowledgments which they themselves made
of it, [Psa 126:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#003.md). The heathen were
but spectators, and spoke of it only as matter of news; they had no part
nor lot in the matter; but the people of God spoke of it as sharers in
it, (1.) With application: "He has done great things for us, things that
we are interested in and have advantage by." Thus it is comfortable
speaking of the redemption Christ has wrought out as wrought out for us.
Who loved me, and gave himself for me. (2.) With affection: "Whereof we
are glad. The heathen are amazed at it, and some of them angry, but we
are glad." While Israel went a whoring from their God joy was forbidden
them ([Hos 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#001).md); but now that the
iniquity of Jacob was purged by the captivity, and their sin taken away,
now God makes them to rejoice. It is the repenting reforming people that
are, and shall be, the rejoicing people. Observe here, \[1.\] God's
appearances for his people are to be looked upon as great things. \[2.\]
God is to be eyed as the author of all the great things done for the
church. \[3.\] It is good to observe how the church's deliverances are
for us, that we may rejoice in them.

[Psalms 126:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 126:4</span></span>

These verses look forward to the mercies that were yet wanted. Those
that had come out of captivity were still in distress, even in their own
land ([Neh 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#003).md), and many yet remained
in Babylon; and therefore they rejoiced with trembling, and bore upon
their hearts the grievances that were yet to be redressed. We have here,
1. A prayer for the perfecting of their deliverance ([Psa
126:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#004).md): "Turn again our captivity. Let
those that have returned to their own land be eased of the burdens which
they are yet groaning under. Let those that remain in Babylon have their
hearts stirred up, as ours were, to take the benefit of the liberty
granted." The beginnings of mercy are encouragements to us to pray for
the completing of it. And while we are here in this world there will
still be matter for prayer, even when we are most furnished with matter
for praise. And, when we are free and in prosperity ourselves, we must
not be unmindful of our brethren that are in trouble and under
restraint. The bringing of those that were yet in captivity to join with
their brethren that had returned would be as welcome to both sides as
streams of water in those countries, which, lying far south, were
parched and dry. As cold water to a thirsty soul, so would this good
news be from that far country, [Pro
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#025.md). 2. A promise for their
encouragement to wait for it, assuring them that, though they had now a
sorrowful time, yet it would end well. But the promise is expressed
generally, that all the saints may comfort themselves with this
confidence, that their seedness of tears will certainly end in a harvest
of joy at last, [Psa 126:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#005.md), [Psa
126:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#006). (1..md) Suffering saints have a
seedness of tears. They are in tears often; they share in the calamities
of human life, and commonly have a greater share in them than others.
But they sow in tears; they do the duty of an afflicted state and so
answer the intentions of the providences they are under. Weeping must
not hinder sowing; when we suffer ill we must be doing well. Nay, as the
ground is by the rain prepared for the seed, and the husbandman
sometimes chooses to sow in the wet, so we must improve times of
affliction, as disposing us to repentance, and prayer, and humiliation.
Nay, there are tears which are themselves the seed that we must sow,
tears of sorrow for sin, our own and others, tears of sympathy with the
afflicted church, and the tears of tenderness in prayer and under the
word. These are precious seed, such as the husbandman sows when corn is
dear and he has but little for his family, and therefore weeps to part
with it, yet buries it under ground, in expectation of receiving it
again with advantage. Thus does a good man sow in tears. (2.) They shall
have a harvest of joy. The troubles of the saints will not last always,
but, when they have done their work, shall have a happy period. The
captives in Babylon were long sowing in tears, but at length they were
brought forth with joy, and then they reaped the benefit of their
patient suffering, and brought their sheaves with them to their own
land, in their experiences of the goodness of God to them. Job, and
Joseph, and David, and many others, had harvests of joy after a
sorrowful seedness. Those that sow in the tears of godly sorrow shall
reap in the joy of a sealed pardon and a settled peace. Those that sow
to the spirit, in this vale of tears, shall of the spirit reap life
everlasting, and that will be a joyful harvest indeed. Blessed are those
that mourn, for they shall be for ever comforted.
