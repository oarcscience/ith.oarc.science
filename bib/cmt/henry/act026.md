### [Acts Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#001.md)

[Acts](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">act 26:0</span></span>

We left Paul at the bar, and Festus, and Agrippa, and Bernice, and all
the great men of the city of Caesarea, upon the bench, or about it,
waiting to hear what he had to say for himself. Now in this chapter we
have, I. The account he gives of himself, in answer to the calumnies of
the Jews. And in this, 1. His humble address to king Agrippa, and the
compliment he passed upon him ([Act
26:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#001).md). 2. His account of his origin,
and education, his profession as a Pharisee, and his adherence still to
that which was then the main article of his creed, in distinction from
the Sadducees, the "resurrection of the dead," however in rituals he had
since departed from it ([Act 26:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#003).md).
3. Of his zeal against the Christian religion, and the professors of it,
in the beginning of his time ([Act
26:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#009).md). 4. Of his miraculous
conversion to the faith of Christ ([Act
26:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#012).md). 5. Of the commission he
received from heaven to preach the gospel to the Gentiles ([Act
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#017.md), [Act
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#018).md). 6. Of his proceedings pursuant
to that commission, which had given this mighty offence to the Jews
([Act 26:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#019).md). 7. Of the doctrine
which he had made it his business to preach to the Gentiles, which was
so far from destroying the law and the prophets that it showed the
fulfilling of both ([Act 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#022.md), [Act
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#023).md). II. The remarks that were made
upon his apology. 1. Festus thought he never heard a man talk so madly,
and slighted him as crazed ([Act
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#024).md). In answer to him, he denies
the charge, and appeals to king Agrippa ([Act
26:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#025).md). 2. King Agrippa, being more
closely and particularly dealt with, thinks he never heard a man talk
more rationally and convincingly, and owns himself almost his convert
([Act 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#028).md), and Paul heartily wishes
him so ([Act 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#029).md). 3. They all
agreed that he was an innocent man, that he ought to be set at liberty,
and that it was a pity he was provoked to put a bar in his own door by
appealing to Caesar ([Act 26:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#030).md).

[Acts 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 26:1</span></span>

Agrippa was the most honourable person in the assembly, having the title
of king bestowed upon him, though otherwise having only the power of
other governors under the emperor, and, though not here superior, yet
senior, to Festus; and therefore, Festus having opened the cause,
Agrippa, as the mouth of the court, intimates to Paul a licence given
him to speak for himself, [Act 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#001.md).
Paul was silent till he had this liberty allowed him; for those are not
the most forward to speak that are best prepared to speak and speak
best. This was a favour which the Jews would not allow him, or not
without difficulty; but Agrippa freely gives it to him. And Paul's cause
was so good that he desired no more than to have liberty to speak for
himself; he needed no advocate, no Tertullus, to speak for him. Notice
is taken of his gesture: He stretched forth his hand, as one that was
under no consternation at all, but had perfect freedom and command of
himself; it also intimates that he was in earnest, and expected their
attention while he answered for himself. Observe, He did not insist upon
his having appealed to Caesar as an excuse for being silent, did not
say, "I will be examined no more till I come to the emperor himself;"
but cheerfully embraced the opportunity of doing honour to the cause he
suffered for. If we must be ready to give a reason of the hope that is
in us to every man that asketh us, much more to every man in authority,
[Pe1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#015.md). Now in this former part of
the speech,

I. Paul addressed himself with a very particular respect to Agrippa,
[Act 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#002.md), [Act
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#003.md). He answered cheerfully before
Felix, because he knew he had been many years a judge to that nation,
[Act 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#010.md). But his opinion of Agrippa
goes further. Observe, 1. Being accused of the Jews, and having many
base things laid to his charge, he is glad he has an opportunity of
clearing himself; so far is he from imagining that his being an apostle
exempted him from the jurisdiction of the civil powers. Magistracy is an
ordinance of God, which we have all benefit by, and therefore must all
be subject to. 2. Since he is forced to answer for himself, he is glad
it is before king Agrippa, who, being himself a proselyte to the Jewish
religion, understood all matters relating to it better than the other
Roman governors did: I know thee to be expert in all customs and
questions which are among the Jews. It seems, Agrippa was a scholar, and
had been particularly conversant in the Jewish learning, was expert in
the customs of the Jewish religion, and knew the nature of them, and
that they were not designed to be either universal or perpetual. He was
expert also in the questions that arose upon those customs, in
determining which the Jews themselves were not all of a mind. Agrippa
was well versed in the scriptures of the Old Testament, and therefore
could make a better judgment upon the controversy between him and the
Jews concerning Jesus being the Messiah than another could. It is an
encouragement to a preacher to have those to speak to that are
intelligent, and can discern things that differ. When Paul says, Judge
you what I say, yet he speaks as to wise men, [Co1
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#015.md). 3. He therefore begs that he
would hear him patiently, makrothumōs - with long suffering. Paul
designs a long discourse, and begs that Agrippa will hear him out, and
not be weary; he designs a plain discourse, and begs that he will hear
him with mildness, and not be angry. Paul had some reason to fear that
as Agrippa, being a Jew, was well versed in the Jewish customs, and
therefore the more competent judge of his cause, so he was soured in
some measure with the Jewish leaven, and therefore prejudiced against
Paul as the apostle of the Gentiles; he therefore says this to sweeten
him: I beseech thee, hear me patiently. Surely the least we can expect,
when we preach the faith of Christ, is to be heard patiently.

II\. He professes that though he was hated and branded as a apostate,
yet he still adhered to all that good which he was first educated and
trained up in; his religion was always built upon the promise of God
made unto the fathers; and this he still built upon.

1\. See here what his religion was in his youth: His manner of life was
well known, [Act 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#004.md), [Act
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#005.md). He was not indeed born among his
own nation, but he was bred among them at Jerusalem. Though he had of
late years been conversant with the Gentiles (which had given great
offence to the Jews), yet at his setting out in the world he was
intimately acquainted with the Jewish nation, and entirely in their
interests. His education was neither foreign nor obscure; it was among
his own nation at Jerusalem, where religion and learning flourished. All
the Jews knew it, all that could remember so long, for Paul made himself
remarkable betimes. Those that knew him from the beginning could testify
for him that he was a Pharisee, that he was not only of the Jewish
religion, and an observer of all the ordinances of it, but that he was
of the most strict sect of that religion, most nice and exact in
observing the institutions of it himself, and most rigid and critical in
imposing them upon others. He was not only called a Pharisee, but he
lived a Pharisee. All that knew him knew very well that never any
Pharisee conformed more punctually to the rules of his order than he
did. Nay, and he was of the better sort of Pharisees; for he was brought
up at the feet of Gamaliel, who was an eminent rabbi of the school of
house of Hillel, which was in much greater reputation for religion than
the school or house of Samai. Now if Paul was a Pharisee, and lived a
Pharisee, (1.) Then he was a scholar, a man of learning, and not an
ignorant, illiterate, mechanic; the Pharisees knew the law, and were
well versed in it, and in the traditional expositions of it. It was a
reproach to the other apostles that they had not had an academical
education, but were bred fishermen, [Act
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013.md). Therefore, that the unbelieving
Jews might be left without excuse, here is an apostle raised up that had
sat at the feet of their most eminent doctors. (2.) Then he was a
moralist, a man of virtue, and not a rake or loose debauched young man.
If he lived like a Pharisee, he was no drunkard nor fornicator; and,
being a young Pharisee, we may hope he was no extortioner, nor had yet
learned the arts which the crafty covetous old Pharisees had of
devouring the houses of poor widows; but he was, as touching the
righteousness which is in the law, blameless. He was not chargeable with
any instance of open vice and profaneness; and therefore, as he could
not be thought to have deserted his religion because he did not know it
(for he was a learned man), so he could not be thought to have deserted
it because he did not love it, or was disaffected to the obligations of
it, for he was a virtuous man, and not inclined to any immorality. (3.)
Then he was orthodox, sound in the faith, and not a deist or sceptic, or
a man of corrupt principles that led to infidelity. He was a Pharisee,
in opposition to a Sadducee; he received those books of the Old
Testament which the Sadducees rejected, believed a world of spirits, the
immortality of the soul, the resurrection of the body, and the rewards
and punishments of the future state, all which the Sadducees denied.
They could not say, He quitted his religion for want of a principle, or
for want of a due regard to divine revelation; no, he always had a
veneration for the ancient promise made of God unto the fathers, and
built his hope upon it.

Now though Paul knew very well that all this would not justify him
before God, nor make a righteousness for him yet he knew it was for his
reputation among the Jews, and an argument ad hominem - such as Agrippa
would feel, that he was not such a man as they represented him to be.
Though he counted it but loss that he might win Christ, yet he mentioned
it when it might serve to honour Christ. He knew very well that all this
while he was a stranger to the spiritual nature of the divine law, and
to heart-religion, and that except his righteousness exceeded this he
should never go to heaven; yet he reflects upon it with some
satisfaction that he had not been before his conversion an atheistical,
profane, vicious man, but, according to the light he had, had lived in
all good conscience before God.

2\. See here what his religion is. He has not indeed such a zeal for the
ceremonial law as he had in his youth. The sacrifices and offerings
appointed by that, he thinks, are superseded by the great sacrifice
which they typified; ceremonial pollutions and purifications from them
he makes no conscience of, and thinks the Levitical priesthood is
honourably swallowed up in the priesthood of Christ; but for the main
principles of his religion he is as zealous for them as ever, and more
so, and resolves to live and die by them.

(1.) His religion is built upon the promise made of God unto the
fathers. It is built upon divine revelation, which he receives and
believes, and ventures his soul upon; it is built upon divine grace, and
that grace manifested and conveyed by promise. The promise of God is the
guide and ground of his religion, the promise made to the fathers, which
was more ancient than the ceremonial law, that covenant which was
confirmed before of God in Christ, and which the law, that was not till
four hundred and thirty years after, could not disannul, [Gal
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#017.md). Christ and heaven are the two
great doctrines of the gospel - that God has given to us eternal life,
and this life is in his Son. Now these two are the matter of the promise
made unto the fathers. It may look back as far as the promise made to
father Adam, concerning the seed of the woman, and those discoveries of
a future state which the first patriarchs acted faith upon, and were
saved by that faith; but it respects chiefly the promise made to father
Abraham, that in his seed all the families of the earth should be
blessed, and that God would be a God to him, and to his seed after him:
the former meaning Christ, the latter heaven; for, if God had not
prepared for them a city, he would have been ashamed to have called
himself their God. [Heb 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016.md).

(2.) His religion consists in the hopes of this promise. He places it
not, as they did, in meats and drinks, and the observance of carnal
ordinances (God had often shown what little account he made of them),
but in a believing dependence upon God's grace in the covenant, and upon
the promise, which was the great charter by which the church was first
incorporated. \[1.\] He had hope in Christ as the promised seed; he
hoped to be blessed in him, to receive the blessing of God and to be
truly blessed. \[2.\] He had hopes of heaven; this is expressly meant,
as appears by comparing [Act 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#015.md),
That there shall be a resurrection of the dead. Paul had no confidence
in the flesh, but in Christ; no expectation at all of great things in
this world, but of greater things in the other world than any this world
can pretend to; he had his eye upon a future state.

(3.) Herein he concurred with all the pious Jews; his faith was not only
according to the scripture, but according to the testimony of the
church, which was a support to it. Though they set him up as a mark, he
was not singular: "Our twelve tribes, the body of the Jewish church,
instantly serving God day and night, hope to come to this promise, that
is, to the good promised." The people of Israel are called the twelve
tribes, because so they were at first; and, though we read not of the
return of the ten tribes in a body, yet we have reason to think many
particular persons, more or less of every tribe, returned to their own
land; perhaps, by degrees, the greater part of those that were carried
away. Christ speaks of the twelve tribes, [Mat
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028.md). Anna was of the tribe of Asher,
[Luk 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#036.md). James directs his epistle
to the twelve tribes scattered abroad, [Jam
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001.md). "Our twelve tribes, which make up
the body of our nation, to which I and others belong. Now all the
Israelites profess to believe in this promise, both of Christ and
heaven, and hope to come to the benefits of them. They all hope for a
Messiah to come, and we that are Christians hope in a Messiah already
come; so that we all agree to build upon the same promise. They look for
the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come, and this
is what I look for. Why should I be looked upon as advancing something
dangerous and heterodox, or as an apostate from the faith and worship of
the Jewish church, when I agree with them in this fundamental article? I
hope to come to the same heaven at last that they hope to come to; and,
if we expect to meet so happily in our end, why should we fall out so
unhappily by the way?" Nay, the Jewish church not only hoped to come to
this promise, but, in the hope of it, they instantly served God day and
night. The temple-service, which consisted in a continual course of
religious duties, morning and evening, day and night, from the beginning
of the year to the end of it, and was kept up by the priests and
Levites, and the stationary men, as they called them, who continually
attended there to lay their hands upon the public sacrifices, as the
representatives of all the twelve tribes, this service was kept up in
the profession of faith in the promise of eternal life, and, in
expectation of it, Paul instantly serves God day and night in the gospel
of his Son; the twelve tribes by their representatives do so in the law
of Moses, but he and they do it in hope of the same promise: "Therefore
they ought not to look upon me as a deserter from their church, so long
as I hold by the same promise that they hold by." Much more should
Christians, who hope in the same Jesus, for the same heaven, though
differing in the modes and ceremonies of worship, hope the best one of
another, and live together in holy love. Or it may be meant of
particular persons who continued in the communion of the Jewish church,
and were very devout in their way, serving God with great intenseness,
and a close application of mind, and constant in it, night and day, as
Anna, who departed not from the temple, but served God (it is the same
word here used) in fastings and prayers night and day, [Luk
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#037.md). "In this way they hope to come
to the promise, and I hope they will." Note, Those only can upon good
grounds hope for eternal life that are diligent and constant in the
service of God; and the prospect of that eternal life should engage us
to diligence and constancy in all religious exercises. We should go on
with our work with heaven in our eye. And of those that instantly serve
God day and night, though not in our way, we ought to judge charitably.

(4.) This was what he was now suffering for - for preaching that
doctrine which they themselves, if they did but understand themselves
aright, must own: I am judged for the hope of the promise made unto the
fathers. He stuck to the promise, against the ceremonial law, while his
persecutors stuck to the ceremonial law, against the promise: "It is for
this hope's sake, king Agrippa, that I am accused of the Jews - because
I do that which I think myself obliged to do by the hope of this
promise." It is common for men to hate and persecute the power of that
religion in others which yet they pride themselves in the form of.
Paul's hope was what they themselves also allowed ([Act
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#015).md), and yet they were thus enraged
against him for practising according to that hope. But it was his honour
that when he suffered as a Christian he suffered for the hope of Israel,
[Act 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#020.md).

(5.) This was what he would persuade all that heard him cordially to
embrace ([Act 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#008).md): Why should it be
thought a thing incredible with you that God should raise the dead? This
seems to come in somewhat abruptly; but it is probable Paul said much
more than is here recorded, and that he explained the promise made to
the fathers to be the promise of the resurrection and eternal life, and
proved that he was in the right way of pursuing his hope of that
happiness because he believed in Christ who had risen from the dead,
which was a pledge and earnest of that resurrection which the fathers
hoped for. Paul is therefore earnest to know the power of Christ's
resurrection, that by it he might attain to the resurrection of the
dead; see [Phi 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010.md), [Phi
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#011.md). Now many of his hearers were
Gentiles, most of them perhaps, Festus particularly, and we may suppose,
when they heard him speak so much of Christ's resurrection, and of the
resurrection from the dead, which the twelve tribes hoped for, that they
mocked, as the Athenians did, began to smile at it, and whispered to one
another what an absurd thing it was, which occasioned Paul thus to
reason with them. What! is it thought incredible with you that God
should raise the dead? So it may be read. If it be marvellous in your
eyes, should it be marvellous in mine eyes, saith the Lord of hosts?
[Zac 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#006.md). If it be above the power of
nature, yet it is not above the power of the God of nature. Note, There
is no reason why we should think it at all incredible that God should
raise the dead. We are not required to believe any thing that is
incredible, any thing that implies a contradiction. There are motives of
credibility sufficient to carry us through all the doctrines of the
Christian religion, and this particularly of the resurrection of the
dead. Has not God an infinite almighty power, to which nothing is
impossible? Did not he make the world at first out of nothing, with a
word's speaking? Did he not form our bodies, form them out of the clay,
and breathe into us the breath of life at first? and cannot the same
power form them again out of their own clay, and put life into them
again? Do we not see a kind of resurrection in nature, at the return of
every spring? Has the sun such a force to raise dead plants, and should
it seem incredible to us that God should raise dead bodies?

III\. He acknowledges that while he continued a Pharisee he was a bitter
enemy to Christians and Christianity, and thought he ought to be so, and
continued so to the moment that Christ wrought that wonderful change in
him. This he mentions,

1\. To show that his becoming a Christian and a preacher was not the
product and result of any previous disposition or inclination that way,
or any gradual advance of thought in favour of the Christian doctrine;
he did not reason himself into Christianity by a chain of arguments, but
was brought into the highest degree of an assurance of it, immediately
from the highest degree of prejudice against it, by which it appeared
that he was made a Christian and a preacher by a supernatural power; so
that his conversion in such a miraculous way was not only to himself,
but to others also, a convincing proof of the truth of Christianity.

2\. Perhaps he designs it for such an excuse of his persecutors as
Christ made for his, when he said, They know not what they do. Paul
himself once thought he did what he ought to do when he persecuted the
disciples of Christ, and he charitably thinks they laboured under the
like mistake. Observe,

(1.) What a fool he was in his opinion ([Act
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#009).md): He thought with himself that he
ought to do many things, every thing that lay in his power, contrary to
the name of Jesus of Nazareth, contrary to his doctrine, his honour, his
interest. That name did not harm, yet, because it agreed not with the
notion he had of the kingdom of the Messiah, he was for doing all he
could against it. He thought he did God good service in persecuting
those who called on the name of Jesus Christ. Note, It is possible for
those to be confident they are in the right who yet are evidently in the
wrong; and for those to think they are doing their duty who are wilfully
persisting in the greatest sin. Those that hated their brethren, and
cast them out, said, Let the Lord be glorified, [Isa
66:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005.md). Under colour and pretext of
religion, the most barbarous and inhuman villanies have been not only
justified, but sanctified and magnified, [Joh
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#002.md).

(2.) What a fury he was in his practice, [Act
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010.md), [Act
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#011.md). There is not a more violent
principle in the world than conscience misinformed. When Paul thought it
his duty to do all he could against the name of Christ, he spared no
pains nor cost in it. He gives an account of what he did of that kind,
and aggravates it as one that was truly penitent for it: I was a
blasphemer, a persecutor, [Ti1 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#013.md).
\[1.\] He filled the jails with Christians, as if they had been the
worst of criminals, designing hereby not only to terrify them, but to
make them odious to the people. He was the devil that cast some of them
into prison ([Rev 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010).md), took them
into custody, in order to their being prosecuted. Many of the saints did
I shut up in prison ([Act 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010).md), both
men and women, [Act 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#003.md). \[2.\] He
made himself the tool of the chief priests. Herein from them he received
authority, as an inferior officer, to put their laws in execution, and
proud enough he was to be a man in authority for such a purpose. \[3.\]
He was very officious to vote, unasked for, the putting of Christians to
death, particularly Stephen, to whose death Saul was consenting ([Act
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001).md), and so made himself particeps
criminis - partaker of the crime. Perhaps he was, for his great zeal,
though young, made a member of the sanhedrim, and there voted for the
condemning of Christians to die; or, after they were condemned, he
justified what was done, and commended it, and so made himself guilty ex
post facto - after the deed was committed, as if he had been a judge or
jury-man. \[4.\] He brought them under punishments of an inferior
nature, in the synagogues, where they were scourged as transgressors of
the rules of the synagogue. He had a hand in the punishing of many; nay,
it should seem the same persons were by his means often punished, as he
himself was five times, [Co2 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#024.md).
\[5.\] He not only punished them for their religion, but, taking a pride
in triumphing over men's consciences, he forced them to abjure their
religion, by putting them to the torture: "I compelled them to blaspheme
Christ, and to say he was a deceiver and they were deceived in him -
compelled them to deny their Master, and renounce their obligations to
him." Nothing will lie heavier upon persecutors than forcing men's
consciences, how much soever they may now triumph in the proselytes they
have made by their violences. \[6.\] His rage swelled so against
Christians and Christianity that Jerusalem itself was too narrow a stage
for it to act upon, but, being exceedingly mad against them, he
persecuted them even to strange cities. He was mad at them, to see how
much they had to say for themselves, notwithstanding all he did against
them, mad to see them multiply the more for their being afflicted. He
was exceedingly mad; the stream of his fury would admit no banks, no
bounds, but he was as much a terror to himself as he was to them, so
great was his vexation within himself that he could not prevail, as well
as his indignation against them. Persecutors are mad men, and some of
them exceedingly mad. Paul was mad to see that those in other cities
were not so outrageous against the Christians, and therefore made
himself busy where he had no business, and persecuted the Christians
even in strange cities. There is not a more restless principle than
malice, especially that which pretends conscience.

This was Paul's character, and this his manner of life in the beginning
of his time; and therefore he could not be presumed to be a Christian by
education or custom, or to be drawn in by hope of preferment, for all
imaginable external objections lay against his being a Christian.

[Acts 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 26:12</span></span>

All who believe a God, and have a reverence for his sovereignty, must
acknowledge that those who speak and act by his direction, and by
warrant from him, are not to be opposed; for that is fighting against
God. Now Paul here, by a plain and faithful narrative of matters of
fact, makes it out to this august assembly that he had an immediate call
from heaven to preach the gospel of Christ to the Gentile world, which
was the thing that exasperated the Jews against him. He here shows,

I. That he was made a Christian by a divine power, notwithstanding all
his prejudices against that way. He was brought into it on a sudden by
the hand of heaven; not compelled to confess Christ by outward force, as
he had compelled others to blaspheme him, but by a divine and spiritual
energy, by a revelation of Christ from above, both to him and in him:
and this when he was in the full career of his sin, going to Damascus,
to suppress Christianity by persecuting the Christians there, as hot as
ever in the cause, his persecuting fury not in the least spent nor
tired, nor was he tempted to give it up by the failing of his friends,
for he had at this time as ample an authority and commission from the
chief priests to persecute Christianity as ever he had, when he was
obliged by a superior power to give up that, and accept another
commission to preach up Christianity. Two things bring about this
surprising change, a vision from heaven and a voice from heaven, which
conveyed the knowledge of Christ to him by the two learning senses of
seeing and hearing.

1\. He saw a heavenly vision, the circumstances of which were such that
it could not be a delusion - deciptio visus, but it was without doubt a
divine appearance. (1.) He saw a great light, a light from heaven, such
as could not be produced by any art, for it was not in the night, but at
mid day; it was not in a house where tricks might have been played with
him, but it was in the way, in the open air; it was such a light as was
above the brightness of the sun, outshone and eclipsed that ([Isa
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023).md), and this could not be the
product of Paul's own fancy, for it shone round about those that
journeyed with him: they were all sensible of their being surrounded
with this inundation of light, which made the sun itself to be in their
eyes a less light. The force and power of this light appeared in the
effects of it; they all fell to the earth upon the sight of it, such a
mighty consternation did it put them into; this light was lightning for
its force, yet did not pass away as lightning, but continued to shine
round about them. In Old Testament times God commonly manifested himself
in the thick darkness, and made that his pavilion, [Ch2
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#001.md). He spoke to Abraham in a great
darkness ([Gen 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#012).md), for that was a
dispensation of darkness; but now that life and immortality were brought
to light by the gospel Christ appeared in a great light. In the creation
of grace, as of the world, the first thing created is light, [Co2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006). (2..md) Christ himself appeared to
him ([Act 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#016).md): I have appeared to
thee for this purpose. Christ was in this light, though those that
travelled with Paul saw the light only, and not Christ in the light. It
is not every knowledge that will serve to make us Christians, but it
must be the knowledge of Christ.

2\. He heard a heavenly voice, an articulate one, speaking to him; it is
here said to be in the Hebrew tongue (which was not taken notice of
before), his native language, the language of his religion, to intimate
to him that though he must be sent among the Gentiles, yet he must not
forget that he was a Hebrew, nor make himself a stranger to the Hebrew
language. In what Christ said to him we may observe, (1.) That he called
him by his name, and repeated it (Saul, Saul), which would surprise and
startle him; and the more because he was now in a strange place, where
he thought nobody knew him. (2.) That he convinced him of sin, of that
great sin which he was now in the commission of, the sin of persecuting
the Christians, and showed him the absurdity of it. (3.) That he
interested himself in the sufferings of his followers: Thou persecutest
me ([Act 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#014).md), and again, It is
Jesus whom thou persecutest, [Act
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#015.md). Little did Paul think, when he
was trampling upon those that he looked upon as the burdens and
blemishes of this earth, that he was insulting one that was so much the
glory of heaven. (4.) That he checked him for his wilful resistance of
those convictions: It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks, or
goads, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke. Paul's spirit at first
perhaps began to rise, but he is told it is at his peril, and then he
yields. Or, it was spoken by way of caution: "Take heed lest thou resist
these convictions, for they are designed to affect thee, not to affront
thee." (5.) That, upon his enquiry, Christ made himself known to him.
Paul asked ([Act 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#015).md), "Who art
thou, Lord? Let me know who it is that speaks to me from heaven, that I
may answer him accordingly?" And he said, "I am Jesus; he whom thou hast
despised, and hated, and vilified; I bear that name which thou hast made
so odious, and the naming of it criminal." Paul thought Jesus was buried
in the earth, and, though stolen out of his own sepulchre, yet laid in
some other. All the Jews were taught to say so, and therefore he is
amazed to hear him speak from heaven, to see him surrounded with all
this glory whom he had loaded with all possible ignominy. This convinced
him that the doctrine of Jesus was divine and heavenly, and not only not
to be opposed, but to be cordially embraced: That Jesus is the Messiah,
for he has not only risen from the dead, but he has received from God
the Father honour and glory; and this is enough to make him a Christian
immediately, to quit the society of the persecutors, whom the Lord from
heaven thus appears against, and to join himself with the society of the
persecuted, whom the Lord from heaven thus appears for.

II\. That he was made a minister by a divine authority: That the same
Jesus that appeared to him in that glorious light ordered him to go and
preach the gospel to the Gentiles; he did not run without sending, nor
was he sent by men like himself, but by him whom the Father sent, [Joh
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#021.md). What is said of his being an
apostle is here joined immediately to that which was said to him by the
way, but it appears by [Act 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015.md), and
[Act 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#015.md), [Act
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#017.md), etc., that it was spoken to him
afterwards; but he puts the two together for brevity-sake: Rise, and
stand upon thy feet. Those whom Christ, by the light of his gospel,
casts down in humiliation for sin, shall find that it is in order to
their rising and standing upon their feet, in spiritual grace, strength,
and comfort. If Christ has torn, it is that he may heal; if he has cast
down, it is that he may raise up. Rise then, and shake thyself from the
dust ([Isa 52:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#002).md), help thyself, and
Christ shall help thee. He must stand up, for Christ shall help thee. He
must stand up, for Christ has work for him to do - has an errand, and a
very great errand, to send him upon: I have appeared to thee to make
thee a minister. Christ has the making of his own ministers; they have
both their qualifications and their commissions from him. Paul thanks
Christ Jesus who put him into the ministry, [Ti1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#012.md). Christ appeared to him to make
him a minister. One way or other, Christ will manifest himself to all
those whom he makes his ministers; for how can those preach him who do
not know him? And how can those know him to whom he does not by his
spirit make himself known? Observe,

1\. The office to which Paul is appointed: he is made a minister, to
attend on Christ, and act for him, as a witness - to give evidence in
his cause, and attest the truth of his doctrine. He must testify the
gospel of the grace of God; Christ appeared to him that he might appear
for Christ before men.

2\. The matter of Paul's testimony: he must give an account to the
world, (1.) Of the things which he had seen, now at this time, must tell
people of Christ's manifesting himself to him by the way, and what he
said to him. He saw these things that he might publish them, and he did
take all occasions to publish them, as here, and before, ch. 22. (2.) Of
those things in which he would appear to him. Christ now settled a
correspondence with Paul, which he designed afterwards to keep up, and
only told him now that he should hear further from him. Paul at first
had but confused notions of the gospel, till Christ appeared to him and
gave him fuller instructions. The gospel he preached he received from
Christ immediately ([Gal 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#012).md); but he
received it gradually, some at one time and some at another, as there
was occasion. Christ often appeared to Paul, oftener, it is likely, than
is recorded, and still taught him, that he might still teach the people
knowledge.

3\. The spiritual protection he was taken under, while he was thus
employed as Christ's witness: all the powers of darkness could not
prevail against him till he had finished his testimony ([Act
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#017).md), delivering thee from the
people of the Jews and from the Gentiles. Note, Christ's witnesses are
under his special care, and, though they may fall into the hands of the
enemies, yet he will take care to deliver them out of their hands, and
he knows how to do it. Christ had shown Paul at this time what great
things he must suffer ([Act 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#016).md), and
yet tells him here he will deliver him from the people. Note, Great
sufferings are reconcilable to the promise of the deliverance of God's
people, for it is not promised that they shall be kept from trouble, but
kept through it; and sometimes God delivers them into the hands of their
persecutors that he may have the honour of delivering them out of their
hands.

4\. The special commission given him to go among the Gentiles, and the
errand upon which he is sent to them; it was some years after Paul's
conversion before he was sent to the Gentiles, or (for aught that
appears) knew any thing of his being designed for that purpose (see [Act
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#021).md); but at length he is ordered to
steer his course that way.

(1.) There is great work to be done among the Gentiles, and Paul must be
instrumental in doing it. Two things must be done, which their case
calls for the doing of: - \[1.\] A world that sits in darkness must be
enlightened; those must be brought to know the things that belong to
their everlasting peace who are yet ignorant of them, to know God as
their end, and Christ as their way, who as yet know nothing of either.
He is sent to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light.
His preaching shall not only make known to them those things which they
had not before heard of, but shall be the vehicle of that divine grace
and power by which their understandings shall be enlightened to receive
those things, and bid them welcome. Thus he shall open their eyes, which
before were shut against the light, and they shall be willing to
understand themselves, their own case and interest. Christ opens the
heart by opening the eyes, does not lead men blindfold, but gives them
to see their own way. He is sent not only to open their eyes for the
present, but to keep them open, to turn them from darkness to light,
that is, from following false and blind guides, their oracles,
divinations, and superstitious usages, received by tradition from their
fathers, and the corrupt notions and ideas they had of their gods, to
follow a divine revelation of unquestionable certainty and truth. This
was turning them from darkness to light, from the ways of darkness to
those on which the light shines. The great design of the gospel is to
instruct the ignorant, and to rectify the mistakes of those who are in
error, that things may be set and seen in a true light. \[2.\] A world
that lies in wickedness, in the wicked one, must be sanctified and
reformed; it is not enough for them to have their eyes opened, they must
have their hearts renewed; not enough to be turned from darkness to
light, but they must be turned from the power of Satan unto God, which
will follow of course; for Satan rules by the power of darkness, and God
by the convincing evidence of light. Sinners are under the power of
Satan; idolaters were so in a special manner, they paid their homage to
devils. All sinners are under the influence of his temptations, yield
themselves captives to him, are at his beck; converting grace turns them
from under the dominion of Satan, and brings them into subjection to
God, to conform to the rules of his word and comply with the dictates
and directions of his Spirit, translates them out of the kingdom of
darkness into the kingdom of his dear Son. When gracious dispositions
are strong in the soul (as corrupt and sinful dispositions had been), it
is then turned from the power of Satan unto God.

(2.) There is a great happiness designed for the Gentiles by this work -
that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among those
who are sanctified; they are turned from the darkness of sin to the
light of holiness, from the slavery of Satan to the service of God; not
that God may be a gainer by them, but that they may be gainers by him.
\[1.\] That they may be restored to his favour, which by sin they have
forfeited and thrown themselves out of: That they may receive
forgiveness of sins. They are delivered from the dominion of sin, that
they may be saved from that death which is the wages of sin. Not that
they may merit forgiveness as a debt of reward, but that they may
receive it as a free gift, that they may be qualified to receive the
comfort of it. They are persuaded to lay down their arms, and return to
their allegiance, that they may have the benefit of the act of
indemnity, and may plead it in arrest of the judgment to be given
against them. \[2.\] That they may be happy in the fruition of him; not
only that they may have their sins pardoned, but that they may have an
inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith that is in me. Note,
First, Heaven is an inheritance, it descends to all the children of God;
for, if children, then heirs. That they may have, klēron - a lot (so it
might be read), alluding to the inheritances of Canaan, which were
appointed by lot, and that also is the act of God, the disposal thereof
is of the Lord. That they may have a right, so some read it; not by
merit, but purely by grace. Secondly, All that are effectually turned
from sin to God are not only pardoned, but preferred - have not only
their attainder reversed, but a patent of honour given to them, and a
grant of a rich inheritance. And the forgiveness of sins makes way for
this inheritance, by taking that out of the way which alone hindered.
Thirdly, All that shall be saved hereafter are sanctified now; those
that have the heavenly inheritance must have it in this way, they must
be prepared and made meet for it. None can be happy that are not holy;
nor shall any be saints in heaven that are not first saints on earth.
Fourthly, We need no more to make us happy than to have our lot among
those that are sanctified, to fare as they fare; this is having our lot
among the chosen, for they are chosen to salvation through
sanctification. Those who are sanctified shall be glorified. Let us
therefore now cast in our lot among them, by coming into the communion
of saints, and be willing to take our lot with them, and share with them
in their afflictions, which (how grievous soever) our lot with them in
the inheritance will abundantly make amends for. Fifthly, We are
sanctified and saved by faith in Christ. Some refer it to the word next
before, sanctified by faith, for faith purifies the heart, and applies
to the soul those precious promises, and subjects the soul to the
influence of that grace, by which we partake of a divine nature. Others
refer it to the receiving of both pardon and the inheritance; it is by
faith accepting the grant: it comes all to one; for it is by faith that
we are justified, sanctified, and glorified. By faith, tē eis eme - that
faith which is in me; it is emphatically expressed. That faith which not
only receives divine revelation in general, but which in a particular
manner fastens upon Jesus Christ and his mediation, by which we rely
upon Christ as the Lord our righteousness, and resign ourselves to him
as the Lord our ruler. This is that by which we receive the remission of
sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and eternal life.

III\. That he had discharged his ministry, pursuant to his commission,
by divine aid, and under divine direction and protection. God, who
called him to be an apostle, owned him in his apostolical work, and
carried him on in it with enlargement and success.

1\. God gave him a heart to comply with the call ([Act
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#019).md): I was not disobedient to the
heavenly vision, for any one would say he ought to be obedient to it.
Heavenly visions have a commanding power over earthly counsels, and it
is at our peril if we be disobedient to them; yet if Paul had conferred
with flesh and blood, and been swayed by his secular interest, he would
have done as Jonah did, gone any where rather than upon this errand; but
God opened his ear, and he was not rebellious. He accepted the
commission, and, having with it received his instructions, he applied
himself to act accordingly.

2\. God enabled him to go through a great deal of work, though in it he
grappled with a great deal of difficulty, [Act
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#020.md). He applied himself to the
preaching of the gospel with all vigour. (1.) He began at Damascus,
where he was converted, for he resolved to lose no time, [Act
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#020). (2..md) When he came to Jerusalem,
where he had his education, he there witnessed for Christ, where he had
most furiously set himself against him, [Act
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#029). (3..md) He preached throughout all
the coasts of Judea, in the country towns and villages, as Christ had
done; he made the first offer of the gospel to the Jews, as Christ had
appointed, and did not leave them till they had wilfully thrust the
gospel from them; and laid out himself for the good of their souls,
labouring more abundantly than any of the apostles, nay perhaps then all
put together.

3\. His preaching was all practical. He did not go about to fill
people's heads with airy notions, did not amuse them with nice
speculations, nor set them together by the ears with matters of doubtful
disputation, but he showed them, declared it, demonstrated it, that they
ought, (1.) To repent of their sins, to be sorry for them and to confess
them, and enter into covenant against them; they ought to bethink
themselves, so the word metanoein properly signifies; they ought to
change their mind and change their way, and undo what they had done
amiss. (2.) To turn to God. They must not only conceive an antipathy to
sin, but they must come into a conformity to God - must not only turn
from that which is evil, but turn to that which is good; they must turn
to God, in love and affection, and return to God in duty and obedience,
and turn and return from the world and the flesh; this is that which is
required from the whole revolted degenerate race of mankind, both Jews
and Gentiles; epistrephein epi ton Theon - to turn back to God, even to
him: to turn to him as our chief good and highest end, as our ruler and
portion, turn our eye to him, turn our heart to him, and turn our feet
unto his testimonies. (3.) To do works meet for repentance. This was
what John preached, who was the first gospel preacher, [Mat
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#008.md). Those that profess repentance
must practise it, must live a life of repentance, must in every thing
carry it as becomes penitents. It is not enough to speak penitent words,
but we must do works agreeable to those words. As true faith, so true
repentance, will work. Now what fault could be found with such preaching
as this? Had it not a direct tendency to reform the world, and to
redress its grievances, and to revive natural religion?

4\. The Jews had no quarrel with him but upon this account, that he did
all he could to persuade people to be religious, and to bring them to
God by bringing them to Christ ([Act
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#021).md): It was for these causes, and
no other, that the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill
me; and let any one judge whether these were crimes worthy of death or
of bonds. He suffered ill, not only for doing well himself, but for
doing good to others. They attempted to kill him; it was his precious
life that they hunted for, and hated, because it was a useful life; they
caught him in the temple worshipping God, and there they set upon him,
as if the better place the better deed

5\. He had no help but from heaven; supported and carried on by that, he
went on in this great work ([Act
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#022).md): "Having therefore obtained
help of God, I continue unto this day; hestēka - I have stood, my life
has been preserved, and my work continued; I have stood my ground, and
have not been beaten off; I have stood to what I said, and have not been
afraid nor ashamed to persist in it." It was now above twenty years
since Paul was converted, and all that time he had been very busy
preaching the gospel in the midst of hazards; and what was it that bore
him up? Not any strength of his own resolutions, but having obtained
help of God; for therefore, because the work was so great and he had so
much opposition, he could not otherwise have gone on in it, but by help
obtained of God. Note, Those who are employed in work for God shall
obtain help from God; for he will not be wanting in necessary
assistances to his servants. And our continuance to this day must be
attributed to help obtained of God; we had sunk, if he had not borne us
up - had fallen off, if he had not carried us on; and it must be
acknowledged with thankfulness to his praise. Paul mentions it as an
evidence that he had his commission from God that from him he had
ability to execute it. The preachers of the gospel could never have
done, and suffered, and prospered, as they did, if they had not had
immediate help from heaven, which they would not have had if it had not
been the cause of God that they were now pleading.

6\. He preached no doctrine but what agreed with the scriptures of the
Old Testament: He witnessed both to small and great, to young and old,
rich and poor, learned and unlearned, obscure and illustrious, all being
concerned in it. It was an evidence of the condescending grace of the
gospel that it was witnessed to the meanest, and the poor were welcome
to the knowledge of it; and of the incontestable truth and power of it
that it was neither afraid nor ashamed to show itself to the greatest.
The enemies of Paul objected against him that he preached something more
than that men should repent, and turn to God, and do works meet for
repentance. These indeed were but what the prophets of the old Testament
had preached; but, besides these, he had preached Christ, and his death,
and his resurrection, and this was what they quarrelled with him for, as
appears by [Act 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#019.md), that he
affirmed Jesus to be alive: "And so I did," says Paul, "and so I do, but
therein also I say no other than that which Moses and the prophets said
should come; and what greater honour can be done to them than to show
that what they foretold is accomplished, and in the appointed season too
- that what they said should come is come, and at the time they
prefixed?" Three things they prophesied, and Paul preached: - (1.) That
Christ should suffer, that the Messiah should be a sufferer - pathētos;
not only a man, and capable of suffering, but that, as Messiah, he
should be appointed to sufferings; that his ignominious death should be
not only consistent with, but pursuant of, his undertaking. The cross of
Christ was a stumbling-block to the Jews, and Paul's preaching it was
the great thing that exasperated them; but Paul stands to it that, in
preaching that, he preached the fulfilling of the Old Testament
predictions, and therefore they ought not only not to be offended at
what he preached, but to embrace it, and subscribe to it. (2.) That he
should be the first that should rise from the dead; not the first in
time, but the first in influence - that he should be the chief of the
resurrection, the head, or principal one, prōtos ex anastaseōs, in the
same sense that he is called the first-begotten from the dead ([Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005).md), and the first-born from the
dead, [Col 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018.md). He opened the womb of
the grave, as the first-born are said to do, and made way for our
resurrection; and he is said to be the first-fruits of those that slept
([Co1 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020).md), for he sanctified the
harvest. He was the first that rose from the dead to die no more; and,
to show that the resurrection of all believers is in virtue of his, just
when he arose many dead bodies of saints arose, and went into the holy
city, [Mat 27:52](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#052.md), [Mat
27:53](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#053). (3..md) That he should show light
unto the people, and to the Gentiles, to the people of the Jews in the
first place, for he was to be the glory of his people Israel. To them he
showed light by himself, and then to the Gentiles by the ministry of his
apostles, for he was to be a light to enlighten those who sat in
darkness. In this Paul refers to his commission ([Act
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#018).md), To turn them from darkness to
light. He rose from the dead on purpose that he might show light to the
people, that he might give a convincing proof of the truth of his
doctrine, and might send it with so much the greater power, both among
Jews and Gentiles. This also was foretold by the Old Testament prophets,
that the Gentiles should be brought to the knowledge of God by the
Messiah; and what was there in all this that the Jews could justly be
displeased at?

[Acts 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 26:24</span></span>

We have reason to think that Paul had a great deal more to say in
defence of the gospel he preached, and for the honour of it, and to
recommend it to the good opinion of this noble audience; he had just
fallen upon that which was the life of the cause - the death and
resurrection of Jesus Christ, and here he is in his element; now he
warms more than before, his mouth is opened towards them, his heart is
enlarged. Lead him but to this subject, and let him have leave to go on,
and he will never know when to conclude; for the power of Christ's
death, and the fellowship of his sufferings, are with him inexhaustible
subjects. It was a thousand pities then that he should be interrupted,
as he is here, and that, being permitted to speak for himself ([Act
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#001).md), he should not be permitted to
say all he designed. But it was a hardship often put upon him, and is a
disappointment to us too, who read his discourse with so much pleasure.
But there is no remedy, the court thinks it is time to proceed to give
in their judgment upon his case.

I. Festus, the Roman governor, is of opinion that the poor man is
crazed, and that Bedlam is the fittest place for him. he is convinced
that he is no criminal, no bad man, that should be punished, but he
takes him to be a lunatic, a distracted man, that should be pitied, but
at the same time should not be heeded, nor a word he says regarded; and
thus he thinks he has found out an expedient to excuse himself both from
condemning Paul as a prisoner and from believing him as a preacher; for,
if he be not compos mentis - in his senses, he is not to be either
condemned or credited. Now here observe,

1\. What it was that Festus said of him ([Act
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#024).md): He said with a loud voice, did
not whisper it to those that sat next him; if so, it had been the more
excusable, but (without consulting Agrippa, to whose judgment he had
seemed to pay profound deference, [Act
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#026).md), said aloud, that he might
oblige Paul to break off his discourse, and might divert the auditors
from attending to it "Paul, thou art beside thyself, thou talkest like a
madman, like one with a heated brain, that knowest not what thou
sayest;" yet he does not suppose that a guilty conscience had disturbed
his reason, nor that his sufferings, and the rage of his enemies against
him, had given any shock to it; but he puts the most candid construction
that could be upon his delirium: Much learning hath made thee mad, thou
hast cracked thy brains with studying. This he speaks, not so much in
anger, as in scorn and contempt. He did not understand what Paul said;
it was above his capacity, it was all a riddle to him, and therefore he
imputes it all to a heated imagination. Si non vis intelligi, debes
negligi - if thou art not willing to be understood, thou oughtest to be
neglected. (1.) He owns Paul to be a scholar, and a man of learning,
because he could so readily refer to what Moses and the prophets wrote,
books that he was a stranger to; and even this is turned to his
reproach. The apostles, who were fishermen, were despised because they
had no learning; Paul, who was a university-man, and bred a Pharisee, is
despised as having too much learning, more than did him good. Thus the
enemies of Christ's ministers will always have something or other to
upbraid them with. (2.) He reproaches him as a madman. The prophets of
the Old Testament were thus stigmatized, to prejudice people against
them by putting them into an ill-name: Wherefore came this mad fellow
unto thee? said the captains of the prophet, [Kg2
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#011.md); [Hos
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007.md). John Baptist and Christ were
represented as having a devil, as being crazed. It is probable that Paul
now spoke with more life and earnestness than he did in the beginning of
his discourse, and used more gestures that were expressive of his zeal,
and therefore Festus put this invidious character upon him, which
perhaps never a one in the company but himself thought of. It is not so
harmless a suggestion as some make it to say concerning those that are
zealous in religion above others that they are crazed.

2\. How Paul cleared himself from this invidious imputation, which
whether he had ever lain under before is not certain; it should seem, it
had been said of him by the false apostles, for he ways ([Co2
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#013).md), If we be beside ourselves, as
they say we are, it is to God; but he was never charged with this before
the Roman governor, and therefore he must say something to this. (1.) He
denies the charge, with due respect indeed to the governor, but with
justice to himself, protesting that there was neither ground nor colour
for it ([Act 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#025).md): "I am not mad,
most noble Festus, nor ever was, nor any thing like it; the use of my
reason, thanks be to God, has been all my days continued to me, and at
this time I do not ramble, but speak the words of truth and soberness,
and know what I say." Observe, Though Festus gave Paul this base and
contemptuous usage, not becoming a gentlemen, much less a judge, yet
Paul is so far from resenting it, and being provoked by it, that he
gives him all possible respect, compliments him with his title of
honour, most noble Festus, to teach us not to render railing for
railing, nor one invidious character for another, but to speak civilly
to those who speak slightly of us. It becomes us, upon all occasions, to
speak the words of truth and soberness, and then we may despise the
unjust censures of men. (2.) He appeals to Agrippa concerning what he
spoke ([Act 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#026).md): For the king knows
of these things, concerning Christ, and his death and resurrection, and
the prophecies of the Old Testament, which had their accomplishment
therein. He therefore spoke freely before him, who knew these were no
fancies, but matters of fact, knew something of them, and therefore
would be willing to know more: For I am persuaded that none of these
things are hidden from him; no, not that which he had related concerning
his own conversion, and the commission he had received to preach the
gospel. Agrippa could not but have heard of it, having been so long
conversant among the Jews. This thing was not done in a corner; all the
country rang of it; and any of the Jews present might have witnessed for
him that they had heard it many a time from others, and therefore it was
unreasonable to censure him as a distracted man for relating it, much
more for speaking of the death and resurrection of Christ, which was so
universally spoken of. Peter tells Cornelius and his friends ([Act
10:37](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#037).md), That word you know which was
published throughout all Judea concerning Christ; and therefore Agrippa
could not be ignorant of it, and it was a shame for Festus that he was
so.

II\. Agrippa is so far from thinking him a madman that he thinks he
never heard a man argue more strongly, nor talk more to the purpose.

1\. Paul applies himself closely to Agrippa's conscience. Some think
Festus was displeased at Paul because he kept his eye upon Agrippa, and
directed his discourse to him all along, and that therefore he gave him
that interruption, [Act 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#024.md). But, if
that was the thing that affronted him, Paul regards it not: he will
speak to those who understand him, and whom he is likely to fasten
something upon, and therefore still addresses Agrippa; and, because he
had mentioned Moses and the prophets as confirming the gospel he
preached, he refers Agrippa to them ([Act
26:27](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#027).md): "King Agrippa, believest thou
the prophets? Dost thou receive the scriptures of the Old Testament as a
divine revelation, and admit them as foretelling good things to come?"
He does not stay for an answer, but, in compliment to Agrippa, takes it
for granted: I know that thou believest; for every one knew that Agrippa
professed the Jews' religion, as his fathers had done, and therefore
both knew the writings of the prophets and gave credit to them. Note, It
is good dealing with those who have acquaintance with the scriptures and
believe them; for such one has some hold of.

2\. Agrippa owns there was a great deal of reason in what Paul said
([Act 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#028).md): Almost thou persuadest
me to be a Christian. Some understand this as spoken ironically, and
read it thus, Wouldst thou in so little a time persuade me to be a
Christian? But, taking it so, it is an acknowledgement that Paul spoke
very much to the purpose, and that, whatever others thought of it, to
his mind there came a convincing power along with what he said: "Paul,
thou art too hasty, thou canst not think to make a convert of me all of
a sudden." Others take it as spoken seriously, and as a confession that
he was in a manner, or within a little, convinced that Christ was the
Messiah; for he could not but own, and had many a time thought so within
himself, that the prophecies of the Old Testament had had their
accomplishment in him; and now that it is urged thus solemnly upon him
he is ready to yield to the conviction, he begins to sound a parley, and
to think of rendering. He is as near being persuaded to believe in
Christ as Felix, when he trembled, was to leave his sins: he sees a
great deal of reason for Christianity; the proofs of it, he owns, are
strong, and such as he cannot answer; the objections against it
trifling, and such as he cannot for shame insist upon; so that if it
were not for his obligations to the ceremonial law, and his respect to
the religion of his fathers and of his country, or his regard to his
dignity as a king and to his secular interests, he would turn Christian
immediately. Note, Many are almost persuaded to be religious who are not
quite persuaded; they are under strong convictions of their duty, and of
the excellency of the ways of God, but yet are overruled by some
external inducements, and do not pursue their convictions.

3\. Paul, not being allowed time to pursue his argument, concludes with
a compliment, or rather a pious wish that all his hearers were
Christians, and this wish turned into a prayer: euxaimēn an tō Theō - I
pray to God for it ([Act 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#029).md); it
was his heart's desire and prayer to God for them all that they might be
saved, [Rom 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#001.md). That not only thou
but all that hear me this day (for he has the same kind design upon them
all) were both almost, and altogether, such as I am, except these bonds.
Hereby, (1.) He professes his resolution to cleave to his religion, as
that which he was entirely satisfied in, and determined to live and die
by. In wishing that they were all as he was, he does in effect declare
against ever being as they were, whether Jews or Gentiles, how much
soever it might be to his worldly advantage. He adheres to the
instruction God gave to the prophet ([Jer
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#019).md), Let them return unto thee, but
return not thou unto them. (2.) He intimates his satisfaction not only
in the truth, but in the benefit and advantage of Christianity; he had
so much comfort in it for the present, and was so sure it would end in
his eternal happiness, that he could not wish better to the best friend
he had in the world than to wish him such a one as he was, a faithful
zealous disciple of Jesus Christ. Let my enemy be as the wicked, says
Job, [Job 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#007.md). Let my friend be as
the Christian, says Paul. (3.) He intimates his trouble and concern that
Agrippa went no further than being almost such a one as he was, almost a
Christian, and not altogether one; for he wishes that he and the rest of
them might be not only almost (what good would that do?) but altogether
such as he was, sincere thorough-paced Christians. (4.) He intimates
that it was the concern, and would be the unspeakable happiness, of
every one of them to become true Christians - that there is grace enough
in Christ for all, be they ever so many - enough for each, be they ever
so craving. (5.) He intimates the hearty good-will he bore to them all;
he wishes them, \[1.\] As well as he wished his own soul, that they
might be as happy in Christ as he was. \[2.\] Better than he now was as
to his outward condition, for he excepts these bonds; he wishes they
might all be comforted Christians as he was, but not persecuted
Christians as he was - that they might taste as much as he did of the
advantages that attended religion, but not so much of its crosses. They
had made light of his imprisonment, and were in no concern for him.
Felix detained him in bonds to gratify the Jews. Now this would have
tempted many a one to wish them all in his bonds, that they might know
what it was to be confined as he was, and then they would know the
better how to pity him; but he was so far from this that, when he wished
them in bonds to Christ, he desired they might never be in bonds for
Christ. Nothing could be said more tenderly nor with a better grace.

III\. They all agree that Paul is an innocent man, and is wronged in his
prosecution. 1. The court broke up with some precipitation ([Act
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#030).md): When he had spoken that
obliging word ([Act 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#029).md), which
moved them all, the king was afraid, if he were permitted to go on, he
would say something yet more moving, which might work upon some of them
to appear more in his favour than was convenient, and perhaps might
prevail with them to turn Christians. The king himself found his own
heart begin to yield, and durst not trust himself to hear more, but,
like Felix, dismissed Paul for this time. They ought in justice to have
asked the prisoner whether he had any more to say for himself; but they
thought he had said enough, and therefore the king rose up, and the
governor, and Bernice, and those that sat with them, concluding the case
was plain, and with this they contented themselves, when Paul had more
to say which would have made it plainer. 2. They all concurred in an
opinion of Paul's innocency, [Act
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#031.md). The court withdrew to consult
of the matter, to know one another's minds upon it, and they talked
among themselves, all to the same purport, that this man does nothing
worthy of bonds - he is not a dangerous man, whom it is prudent to
confine. After this, Nero made a law for the putting of those to death
who professed the Christian religion, but as yet there was no law of
that kind among the Romans, and therefore no transgression; and this
judgment of theirs is a testimony against that wicked law which Nero
made not long after this, that Paul, the most active zealous Christian
that ever was, was adjudged, even by those that were no friends to his
way, to have done nothing worthy of death, or of bonds. Thus was he made
manifest in the conscience of those who yet would not receive his
doctrine; and the clamours of the hot-headed Jews, who cried out, Away
with him, it is not fit he should live, were shamed by the moderate
counsels of this court. 3. Agrippa gave his judgment that he might have
been set at liberty, if he had not himself appealed to Caesar ([Act
26:32](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#032).md), but by that appeal he had put
a bar in his own door. Some think that by the Roman law this was true,
that, when a prisoner had appealed to the supreme court, the inferior
courts could no more discharge him than they could condemn him; and we
suppose the law was so, if the prosecutors joined issue upon the appeal,
and consented to it. But it does not appear that in Paul's case the
prosecutors did so; he was forced to do it, to screen himself from their
fury, when he saw the governor did not take the care he ought to have
done for his protection. And therefore others think that Agrippa and
Festus, being unwilling to disoblige the Jews by setting him at liberty,
made this serve for an excuse of their continuing him in custody, when
they themselves knew they might have justified the discharging of him.
Agrippa, who was but almost persuaded to be a Christian, proves no
better than if he had not been at all persuaded. And now I cannot tell,
(1.) Whether Paul repented of his having appealed to Caesar, and wished
he had not done it, blaming himself for it as a rash thing, now he saw
that was the only thing that hindered his discharge. He had reason
perhaps to reflect upon it with regret, and to charge himself with
imprudence and impatience in it, and some distrust of the divine
protection. He had better have appealed to God than to Caesar. It
confirms what Solomon says ([Ecc
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012).md), Who knows what is good for man
in this life? What we think is for our welfare often proves to be a
trap; such short-sighted creatures are we, and so ill-advised in
leaning, as we do, to our own understanding. Or, (2.) Whether,
notwithstanding this, he was satisfied in what he had done, and was easy
in his reflections upon it. His appealing to Caesar was lawful, and what
became a Roman citizen, and would help to make his cause considerable;
and forasmuch as when he did it it appeared to him, as the case then
stood, to be for the best, though afterwards it appeared otherwise, he
did not vex himself with any self-reproach in the matter, but believed
there was a providence in it, and it would issue well at last. And
besides, he was told in a vision that he must bear witness to Christ at
Rome, [Act 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#011.md). And it is all one to
him whether he goes thither a prisoner or at his liberty; he knows the
counsel of the Lord shall stand, and says, Let it stand. The will of the
Lord be done.
