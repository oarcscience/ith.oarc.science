### [Exodus Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 32:0</span></span>

It is a very lamentable interruption which the story of this chapter
gives to the record of the establishment of the church, and of religion
among the Jews. Things went on admirably well towards that happy
settlement: God had shown himself very favourable, and the people also
had seemed to be pretty tractable. Moses had now almost completed his
forty days upon the mount, and, we may suppose, was pleasing himself
with the thoughts of the very joyful welcome he should have to the camp
of Israel at his return, and the speedy setting up of the tabernacle
among them. But, behold, the measures are broken, the sin of Israel
turns away those good things from them, and puts a stop to the current
of God's favours; the sin that did the mischief (would you think it?)
was worshipping a golden calf. The marriage was ready to be solemnized
between God and Israel, but Israel plays the harlot, and so the match is
broken, and it will be no easy matter to piece it again. Here is, I. The
sin of Israel, and of Aaron particularly, in making the golden calf for
a god ([Exo 32:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001).md), and worshipping
it ([Exo 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#005.md), [Exo
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#006).md). II. The notice which God gave
of this to Moses, who was now in the mount with him ([Exo
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#007.md), [Exo
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#008).md), and the sentence of his wrath
against them ([Exo 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#009.md), [Exo
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#010).md). III. The intercession which
Moses immediately made for them in the mount ([Exo
32:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#011).md), and the prevalency of that
intercession ([Exo 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#014).md). IV. His
coming down from the mount, when he became an eye-witness of their
idolatry ([Exo 32:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#015).md), in
abhorrence of which, and as an expression of just indignation, he broke
the tables ([Exo 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#019).md), and burnt the
golden calf ([Exo 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#020).md). V. The
examination of Aaron about it ([Exo
32:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#021).md). VI. Execution done upon the
ring-leaders in the idolatry ([Exo
32:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#025).md). VII. The further
intercession Moses made for them, to turn away the wrath of God from
them ([Exo 32:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#030).md), and a reprieve
granted thereupon, reserving them for a further reckoning ([Exo
32:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#033), etc..md).

[Exodus 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 32:1</span></span>

While Moses was in the mount, receiving the law from God, the people had
time to meditate upon what had been delivered, and prepare themselves
for what was further to be revealed, and forty days was little enough
for that work; but, instead of that, there were those among them that
were contriving how to break the laws they had already received, and to
anticipate those which they were in expectation of. On the thirty-ninth
day of the forty, the plot broke out of rebellion against the Lord. Here
is,

I. A tumultuous address which the people made to Aaron, who was
entrusted with the government in the absence of Moses: Up, make us gods,
which shall go before us, [Exo 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001.md).

1\. See the ill effect of Moses's absence from them; if he had not had
God's call both to go and stay, he would not have been altogether free
from blame. Those that have the charge of others, as magistrates,
ministers, and masters of families, ought not, without just cause, to
absent themselves from their charge, lest Satan get advantage thereby.

2\. See the fury and violence of a multitude when they are influenced
and corrupted by such as lie in wait to deceive. Some few, it is likely,
were at first possessed with this humour, while many, who would never
have thought of it if they had not put it into their hearts, were
brought to follow their pernicious ways; and presently such a multitude
were carried down the stream that the few who abhorred the proposal
durst not so much as enter their protestation against it. Behold how
great a matter a little fire kindles! Now what was the matter with this
giddy multitude?

(1.) They were weary of waiting for the promised land. They thought
themselves detained too long at mount Sinai; though there they lay very
safe and very easy, well fed and well taught, yet they were impatient to
be going forward. They had a God that staid with them, and manifested
his presence with them by the cloud; but this would not serve. They must
have a god to go before them; they are for hastening to the land flowing
with milk and honey, and cannot stay to take their religion along with
them. Note, Those that would anticipate God's counsels are commonly
precipitate in their own. We must first wait for God's law before we
catch at his promises. He that believeth doth not make haste, not more
haste than good speed.

(2.) They were weary of waiting for the return of Moses. When he went up
into the mount, he had not told them (for God had not told him) how long
he must stay; and therefore, when he had outstayed their time, though
they were every way well provided for in his absence, some bad people
advanced I know not what surmises concerning his delay: As for this
Moses, the man that brought us up out of Egypt, we wot not what has
become of him. Observe, \[1.\] How slightly they speak of his person -
this Moses. Thus ungrateful are they to Moses, who had shown such a
tender concern for them, and thus do they walk contrary to God. While
God delights to put honour upon him, they delight to put contempt upon
him, and this to the face of Aaron his brother, and now his viceroy.
Note, The greatest merits cannot secure men from the greatest
indignities and affronts in this ungrateful world. \[2.\] How
suspiciously they speak of his delay: We wot not what has become of him.
They thought he was either consumed by the devouring fire or starved for
want to food, as if that God who kept and fed them, who were so
unworthy, would not take care for the protection and supply of Moses his
favourite. Some of them, who were willing to think well of Moses,
perhaps suggested that he was translated to heaven like Enoch; while
others that cared not how ill they thought of him insinuated that he had
deserted his undertaking, as unable to go on with it, and had returned
to his father-in-law to keep his flock. All these suggestions were
perfectly groundless and absurd, nothing could be more so; it was easy
to tell what had become of him: he was seen to go into the cloud, and
the cloud he went into was still seen by all Israel upon the top of the
mount; they had all the reason in the world to conclude that he was safe
there; if the Lord had been pleased to kill him, he would not have shown
him such favours as these. If he tarried long, it was because God had a
great deal to say to him, for their good; he resided upon the mount as
the ambassador, and he would certainly return as soon as he had finished
the business he went upon; and yet they make this the colour for their
wicked proposal: We wot not what has become of him. Note, First, Those
that are resolved to think ill, when they have ever so much reason to
think well, commonly pretend that they know not what to think. Secondly,
Misinterpretations of our Redeemer's delays are the occasion of a great
deal of wickedness. Our Lord Jesus has gone up into the mount of glory,
where he is appearing in the presence of Gold for us, but out of our
sight; the heavens must contain him, must conceal him, that we may live
by faith. There he has been long; there he is yet. Hence unbelievers
suggest that they know not what has become of him; and ask, Where is the
promise of his coming? ([Pe2 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#004).md), as
if, because he has not come yet, he would never come. The wicked servant
emboldens himself in his impieties with this consideration, My Lord
delays his coming. Thirdly, Weariness in waiting betrays us to a great
many temptations. This began Saul's ruin; he staid for Samuel to the
last hour of the time appointed, but had not patience to stay that hour
([Sa1 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#008), etc..md); so Israel here, if
they could but have staid one day longer, would have seen what had
become of Moses. The Lord is a God of judgment, and must be waited for
till he comes waited for though he tarry; and then we shall not lose our
labour, for he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.

(3.) They were weary of waiting for a divine institution of religious
worship among them for that was the thing they were now in expectation
of. They were told that they must serve God in this mountain, and fond
enough they would be of the pomp and ceremony of it; but, because that
was not appointed them so soon as they wished, they would set their own
wits on work to devise signs of God's presence with them, and would
glory in them, and have a worship of their own invention, probably such
as they had seen among the Egyptians; for Stephen says that when they
said unto Aaron, Make us gods, they did, in heart, turn back into Egypt,
[Act 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#039.md), [Act
7:40](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#040.md). This was a very strange motion,
Up, make us gods. If they knew not what had become of Moses, and thought
him lost, it would have been decent for them to have appointed a solemn
mourning for him for certain days; but see how soon so great a
benefactor is forgotten. If they had said, "Moses is lost, make us a
governor," there would have been some sense in it, though a great deal
of ingratitude to the memory of Moses, and contempt of Aaron and Hur who
were left lords-justices in his absence; but to say, Moses is lost, make
us a god, was the greatest absurdity imaginable. Was Moses their god?
Had he ever pretended to be so? Whatever had become of Moses, was it not
evident, beyond contradiction that God was still with them? And had they
any room to question his leading their camp who victualled it so well
every day? Could they have any other god that would provide so well for
them as he had done, nay as he now did? And yet, Make us gods, which
shall go before us! Gods! How many would they have? Is not one
sufficient? Make us gods! and what good would gods of their own making
do them? They must have such gods to go before them as could not go
themselves further than they were carried. So wretchedly besotted and
intoxicated are idolaters: they are mad upon their idols, [Jer
50:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#038.md).

II\. Here is the demand which Aaron makes of their jewels thereupon:
Bring me your golden ear-rings, [Exo
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#002.md). We do not find that he said one
word to discountenance their proposal; he did not reprove their
insolence, did not reason with them to convince them of the sin and
folly of it, but seemed to approve the motion, and showed himself not
unwilling to humour them in it. One would hope he designed, at first,
only to make a jest of it, and, by setting up a ridiculous image among
them, to expose the motion, and show them the folly of it. But, if so,
it proved ill jesting with sin: it is of dangerous consequence for the
unwary fly to play about the candle. Some charitably suppose that when
Aaron told them to break off their ear-rings, and bring them to him, he
did it with design to crush the proposal, believing that though their
covetousness would have let them lavish gold out of the bag to make an
idol of ([Isa 46:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#006).md), yet their pride
would not have suffered them to part with the golden ear-rings. But it
is not safe to try how far men's sinful lusts will carry them in a
sinful way, and what expense they will be at; it proved here a dangerous
experiment.

III\. Here is the making of the golden calf, [Exo
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#003.md), [Exo
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#004.md). 1. The people brought in their
ear-rings to Aaron, whose demand of them, instead of discouraging the
motion, perhaps did rather gratify their superstition, and beget in them
a fancy that the gold taken from their ears would be the most
acceptable, and would make the most valuable god. Let their readiness to
part with their rings to make an idol of shame us out of our
niggardliness in the service of the true God. Did they not draw back
from the charge of their idolatry? And shall we grudge the expenses of
our religion, or starve so good a cause? 2. Aaron melted down their
rings, and, having a mould prepared for the purpose, poured the melted
gold into it, and then produced it in the shape of an ox or calf, giving
it some finishing strokes with a graving tool. Some think that Aaron
chose this figure, for a sign or token of the divine presence, because
he thought the head and horns of an ox a proper emblem of the divine
power, and yet, being so plain and common a thing, he hoped the people
would not be so sottish as to worship it. But it is probable that they
had learnt of the Egyptians thus to represent the Deity, for it is said
([Eze 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#008).md), They did not forsake the
idols of Egypt, and ([Exo 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#008).md),
Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt. Thus they changed
their glory into the similitude of an ox ([Psa
106:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#020).md), and proclaimed their own
folly, beyond that of other idolaters, who worshipped the host of
heaven.

IV\. Having made the calf in Horeb, they worshipped the graven image,
[Psa 106:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#019.md). Aaron, seeing the people
fond of their calf, was willing yet further to humour them, and he built
an altar before it, and proclaimed a feast to the honour of it ([Exo
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#005).md), a feast of dedication. Yet he
calls it a feast to Jehovah; for, brutish as they were, they did not
imagine that this image was itself a god, nor did they design to
terminate their adoration in the image, but they made it for a
representation of the true God, whom they intended to worship in and
through this image; and yet this did not excuse them from gross
idolatry, any more than it will excuse the papists, whose plea it is
that they do not worship the image, but God by the image, so making
themselves just such idolaters as the worshippers of the golden calf,
whose feast was a feast to Jehovah, and proclaimed to be so, that the
most ignorant and unthinking might not mistake it. The people are
forward enough to celebrate this feast ([Exo
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#006).md): They rose up early on the
morrow, to show how well pleased they were with the solemnity, and,
according to the ancient rites of worship, they offered sacrifice to
this new-made deity, and then feasted upon the sacrifice; thus having,
at the expense of their ear-rings, made their god, they endeavour, at
the expense of their beasts, to make this god propitious. Had they
offered these sacrifices immediately to Jehovah, without the
intervention of an image, they might (for aught I know) have been
accepted ([Exo 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#024).md); but having set
up an image before them as a symbol of God's presence, and so changed
the truth of God into a lie, these sacrifices were an abomination,
nothing could be more so. When the idolatry of theirs is spoken of in
the New Testament the account of their feast upon the sacrifice is
quoted and referred to ([Co1 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#007).md):
They sat down to eat and drink of the remainder of what was sacrificed,
and then rose up to play, to play the fool, to play the wanton. Like
god, like worship. They would not have made a calf their god if they had
not first made their belly their god; but, when the god was a jest, no
marvel that the service was sport. Being vain in their imaginations,
they became vain in their worship, so great was this vanity. Now, 1. It
was strange that any of the people, especially so great a number of
them, should do such a thing. Had they not, but the other day, in this
very place, heard the voice of the Lord God speaking to them out of the
midst of the fire, Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image? Had
they not heard the thunder, seen the lightnings, and felt the
earthquake, with the dreadful pomp of which this law was given? Had they
not been particularly cautioned not to make gods of gold? [Exo
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#023.md). Nay, had they not themselves
solemnly entered into covenant with God, and promised that all that
which he had said unto them they would do, and would be obedient? [Exo
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#007.md). And yet, before they stirred
from the place where this covenant had been solemnly ratified, and
before the cloud was removed from the top of mount Sinai, thus to break
an express command, in defiance of an express threatening that this
iniquity should be visited upon them and their children - what shall be
think of it? It is a plain indication that the law was no more able to
sanctify than it was to justify; by it is the knowledge of sin, but not
the cure of it. This is intimated in the emphasis laid upon the place
where this sin was committed ([Psa
106:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#019).md). They made a calf in Horeb,
the very place where the law was given. It was otherwise with those that
received the gospel; they immediately turned from idols; [Th1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009.md). 2. It was especially strange that
Aaron should be so deeply implicated in this sin, that he should make
the calf, and proclaim the feast! Is this Aaron, the saint of the Lord,
the brother of Moses his prophet, that could speak so well. ([Exo
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#014).md), and yet speaks not one word
against this idolatry? Is this he that had not only seen, but had been
employed in summoning, the plagues of Egypt, and the judgments, executed
upon the gods of the Egyptians? What! and yet himself copying out the
abandoned idolatries of Egypt? With what face could they say, These are
thy gods that brought thee out of Egypt, when they thus bring the
idolatry of Egypt (the worst thing there) along with them? Is this
Aaron, who had been with Moses in the mount ([Exo
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#024.md); [Exo
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#009).md), and knew that there was no
manner of similitude seen there, by which they might make an image? Is
this Aaron who was entrusted with the care of the people in the absence
of Moses? Is he aiding and abetting in this rebellion against the Lord?
How was it possible that he should ever do so sinful a thing? Either he
was strangely surprised into it, and did it when he was half asleep, or
he was frightened into it by the outrages of the rabble. The Jews have a
tradition that his colleague Hur opposing it the people fell upon him
and stoned him (and therefore we never read of him after) and that this
frightened Aaron into a compliance. And God left him to himself, \[1.\]
To teach us what the best of men are when they are so left, that we may
cease from man, and that he who thinks he stands may take heed lest he
fall. \[2.\] Aaron was, at this time, destined by the divine appointment
to the great office of the priesthood; though he knew it not, Moses in
the mount did. Now, lest he should be lifted up, above measure, with the
honours that were to be put upon him, a messenger of Satan was suffered
to prevail over him, that the remembrance thereof might keep him humble
all his days. He who had once shamed himself so far as to build an altar
to a golden calf must own himself altogether unworthy of the honour of
attending at the altar of God, and purely indebted to free grace for it.
Thus pride and boasting were for ever silenced, and a good effect
brought out of a bad cause. By this likewise it was shown that the law
made those priests who had infirmity, and needed first to offer for
their own sins.

[Exodus 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 32:7</span></span>

Here, I. God acquaints Moses with what was doing in the camp while he
was absent, [Exo 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#007.md), [Exo
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#008.md). He could have told him sooner,
as soon as the first step was taken towards it, and have hastened him
down to prevent it; but he suffered it to come to this height, for wise
and holy ends, and then sent him down to punish it. Note, It is no
reproach to the holiness of God that he suffers sin to be committed,
since he knows, not only how to restrain it when he pleases, but how to
make it serviceable to the designs of his own glory. Observe what God
here says to Moses concerning this sin. 1. That they had corrupted
themselves. Sin is the corruption or depravation of the sinner, and it
is a self-corruption; every man is tempted when he is drawn aside of his
own lust. 2. That they had turned aside out of the way. Sin is a
deviation from the way of our duty into a by-path. When they promised to
do all that God should command them, they set out as fair as could be;
but now they missed their way, and turned aside. 3. That they had turned
aside quickly, quickly after the law was given them and they had
promised to obey it, quickly after God had done such great things for
them and declared his kind intentions to do greater. They soon forgot
his works. To fall into sin quickly after we have renewed our covenants
with God, or received special mercy from him, is very provoking. 4. He
tells him particularly what they had done: They have made a calf, and
worshipped it. Note, Those sins which are concealed from our governors
are naked and open before God. He sees that which they cannot discover,
nor is any of the wickedness in the world hidden from him. We could not
bear to see the thousandth part of that provocation which God sees every
day and yet keeps silence. 5. He seems to disown them, in saying to
Moses, They are thy people whom thou broughtest up out of the land of
Egypt; as if he had said, "I will not own any relation to them, or
concern for them; let it never be said that they are my people, or that
I brought them out of Egypt." Note, Those that corrupt themselves not
only shame themselves, but even make God himself ashamed of them and of
his kindness to them. 6. He sends him down to them with all speed: Go,
get thee down. He must break off even his communion with God to go and
do his duty as a magistrate among the people; so must Joshua, [Jos
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#010.md). Every thing is beautiful in its
season.

II\. He expresses his displeasure against Israel for this sin, and the
determination of his justice to cut them off, [Exo
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#009.md), [Exo
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#010.md). 1. He gives this people their
true character: "It is a stiff-necked people, unapt to come under the
yoke of the divine law, and governed as it were by a spirit of
contradiction, averse to all good and prone to evil, obstinate against
the methods employed for their cure." Note, The righteous God sees, not
only what we do, but what we are, not only the actions of our lives, but
the dispositions of our spirits, and has an eye to them in all his
proceedings. 2. He declares what was their just desert - that his wrath
should wax hot against them, so as to consume them at once, and blot out
their name from under heaven ([Deu
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#014).md); not only cast them out of
covenant, but chase them out of the world. Note, Sin exposes us to the
wrath of God; and that wrath, if it be not allayed by divine mercy, will
burn us up as stubble. It were just with God to let the law have its
course against sinners, and to cut them off immediately in the very act
of sin; and, if he should do so, it would be neither loss nor dishonour
to him. 3. He holds out inducements to Moses not to intercede for them:
Therefore, let me alone. What did Moses, or what could he do, to hinder
God from consuming them? When God resolves to abandon a people, and the
decree of ruin has gone forth, no intercession can prevent it, [Eze
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#014.md); [Jer
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001.md). But God would thus express the
greatness of his just displeasure against them, after the manner of men,
who would have none to intercede for those they resolve to be severe
with. Thus also he would put an honour upon prayer, intimating that
nothing but the intercession of Moses could save them from ruin, that he
might be a type of Christ, by whose mediation alone God would reconcile
the world unto himself. That the intercession of Moses might appear the
more illustrious, God fairly offers him that, if he would not interpose
in this matter, he would make of him a great nation, that either, in
process of time, he would raise up a people out of his loins, or that he
would immediately, by some means or other, bring another great nation
under his government and conduct, so that he should be no loser by their
ruin. Had Moses been of a narrow selfish spirit, he would have closed
with this offer; but he prefers the salvation of Israel before the
advancement of his own family. Here was a man fit to be a governor.

III\. Moses earnestly intercedes with God on their behalf ([Exo
32:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#011).md): he besought the Lord his
God. If God would not be called the God of Israel, yet he hoped he might
address him as his own God. What interest we have at the throne of grace
we should improve for the church of God, and for our friends. Now Moses
is standing in the gap to turn away the wrath of God, [Psa
106:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#023.md). He wisely took the hint which
God gave him when he said, Let me alone, which, though it seemed to
forbid his interceding, did really encourage it, by showing what power
the prayer of faith has with God. In such a case, God wonders if there
be no intercessor, [Isa 59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016.md).
Observe, 1. His prayer ([Exo 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#012).md):
Turn from thy fierce wrath; not as if he thought God was not justly
angry, but he begs that he would not be so greatly angry as to consume
them. "Let mercy rejoice against judgment; repent of this evil; change
the sentence of destruction into that of correction." 2. His pleas. He
fills his mouth with arguments, not to move God, but to express his own
faith and to excite his own fervency in prayer. He urges, (1.) God's
interest in them, the great things he had already done for them, and the
vast expense of favours and miracles he had been at upon them, [Exo
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#011.md). God had said to Moses ([Exo
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#007).md), They are thy people, whom thou
broughtest up out of Egypt; but Moses humbly turns them back upon God
again: "They are thy people, thou art their Lord and owner; I am but
their servant. Thou broughtest them forth out of Egypt; I was but the
instrument in thy hand; that was done in order to their deliverance
which thou only couldest do." Though their being his people was a reason
why he should be angry with them for setting up another god, yet it was
a reason why he should not be so angry with them as to consume them.
Nothing is more natural than for a father to correct his son, but
nothing more unnatural than for a father to slay his son. And as the
relation is a good plea ("they are thy people"), so is the experience
they had had of his kindness to them: "Thou broughtest them out of
Egypt, though they were unworthy, and had there served the gods of the
Egyptians, [Jos 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#015.md). If thou didst
that for them, notwithstanding their sins in Egypt, wilt thou undo it
for their sins of the same nature in the wilderness?" (2.) He pleads the
concern of God's glory ([Exo 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#012).md):
Wherefore should the Egyptians say, For mischief did he bring them out?
Israel is dear to Moses as his kindred, as his charge; but it is the
glory of God that he is most concerned for; this lies nearer his heart
than any thing else. If Israel could perish without any reproach to
God's name, Moses could persuade himself to sit down contented; but he
cannot bear to hear God reflected on, and therefore this he insists
upon, Lord, what will the Egyptians say? Their eyes, and the eyes of all
the neighbouring nations, were now upon Israel; from the wondrous
beginnings of that people, they raised their expectations of something
great in their latter end; but, if a people so strangely saved should be
suddenly ruined, what would the world say of it, especially the
Egyptians, who have such an implacable hatred both to Israel and to the
God of Israel? They would say, "God was either weak, and could not, or
fickle, and would not, complete the salvation he began; he brought them
forth to that mountain, not to sacrifice (as was pretended), but to be
sacrificed." They will not consider the provocation given by Israel, to
justify the proceeding, but will think it cause enough for triumph that
God and his people could not agree, but that their God had done that
which they (the Egyptians) wished to see done. Note, The glorifying of
God's name, as it ought to be our first petition (it is so in the Lord's
prayer), so it ought to be our great plea, [Psa
79:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#009.md) Do not disgrace the throne of thy
glory, [Jer 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#021.md); and see [Jer
33:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#008.md), [Jer
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#009.md). And, if we would with comfort
plead this with God as a reason why he should not destroy us, we ought
to plead it with ourselves as a reason why we should not offend him:
What will the Egyptians say? We ought always to be careful that the name
of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed through us. (3.) He pleads
God's promise to the patriarchs that he would multiply their seed, and
give them the land of Canaan for an inheritance, and this promise
confirmed by an oath, an oath by himself, since he could swear by no
greater, [Exo 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#013.md). God's promises
are to be our pleas in prayer; for what he has promised he is able to
perform, and the honour of this truth is engaged for the performance of
it. "Lord, if Israel be cut off, what will become of the promise? Shall
their unbelief make that of no effect? God forbid." Thus we must take
our encouragement in prayer from God only.

IV\. God graciously abated the rigour of the sentence, and repented of
the evil he thought to do ([Exo
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#014).md); though he designed to punish
them, yet he would not ruin them. See here, 1. The power of prayer; God
suffers himself to be prevailed with by the humble believing importunity
of intercessors. 2. The compassion of God towards poor sinners, and how
ready he is to forgive. Thus he has given other proofs besides his own
oath that he has no pleasure in the death of those that die; for he not
only pardons upon the repentance of sinners, but spares and reprieves
upon the intercession of others for them.

[Exodus 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 32:15</span></span>

Here is, I. The favour of God to Moses, in trusting him with the two
tables of the testimony, which, though of common stone, were far more
valuable than all the precious stones that adorned the breast-plate of
Aaron. The topaz of Ethiopia could not equal them, [Exo
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#015.md), [Exo
32:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#016.md). God himself, without the
ministry either of man or angel (for aught that appears), wrote the ten
commandments on these tables, on both their sides, some on one table and
some on the other, so that they were folded together like a book, to be
deposited in the ark.

II\. The familiarity between Moses and Joshua. While Moses was in the
cloud, as in the presence-chamber, Joshua continued as near as he might,
in the anti-chamber (as it were), waiting till Moses came out, that he
might be ready to attend him; and though he was all alone for forty days
(fed, it is likely, with manna), yet he was not weary of waiting, as the
people were, but when Moses came down he came with him, and not till
then. And here we are told what constructions they put upon the noise
that they heard in the camp, [Exo
32:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#017.md), [Exo
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#018.md). Though Moses had been so long
in immediate converse with God, yet he did not disdain to talk freely
with his servant Joshua. Those whom God advances he preserves from being
puffed up. Nor did he disdain to talk of the affairs of the camp.
Blessed Paul was not the less mindful of the church on earth for having
been in the third heavens, where he heard unspeakable words. Joshua, who
was a military man, and had the command of the train-bands, feared there
was a noise of war in the camp, and then he would be missed; but Moses,
having received notice of it from God, better distinguished the sound,
and was aware that it was the voice of those that sing. It does not
however appear that he told Joshua what he knew of the occasion of their
singing; for we should not be forward to proclaim men's faults: they
will be known too soon.

III\. The great and just displeasure of Moses against Israel, for their
idolatry. Knowing what to expect, he was presently aware of the golden
calf, and the sport the people made with it. He saw how merry they could
be in his absence, how soon he was forgotten among them, and what little
thought they had of him and his return. He might justly take this ill,
as an affront to himself, but this was the least part of the grievance;
he resented it as an offence to God, and the scandal of his people. See
what a change it is to come down from the mount of communion with God to
converse with a world that lies in wickedness. In God we see nothing but
what is pure and pleasant, in the world nothing but pollution and
provocation. Moses was the meekest man on the earth, and yet when he saw
the calf, and the dancing, his anger waxed hot. Note, It is no breach of
the law of meekness to show our displeasure at the wickedness of the
wicked. Those are angry and sin not that are angry at sin only, not as
against themselves, but as against God. Ephesus is famous for patience,
and yet cannot bear those that are evil, [Rev
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#002.md). It becomes us to be cool in our
own cause, but warm in God's. Moses showed himself very angry, both by
breaking the tables and burning the calf, that he might, by these
expressions of strong indignation, awaken the people to a sense of the
greatness of the sin they had been guilty of, which they would have been
ready to make light of if he had not thus shown his resentment, as one
in earnest for their conviction. 1. To convince them that they had
forfeited and lost the favour of God, he broke the tables, [Exo
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#019.md). Though God knew of their sin,
before Moses came down, yet he did not order him to leave the tables
behind him, but gave them to him to take down in his hand, that the
people might see how forward God was to take them into covenant with
himself, and that nothing but their own sin prevented it; yet he put in
into his heart, when the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered (as the
expression is, [Hos 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#001).md), to break the
tables before their eyes (as it is [Deu
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#017).md), that the sight of it might the
more affect them, and fill them with confusion, when they saw what
blessings they had lost. Thus, they being guilty of so notorious an
infraction of the treaty now on foot, the writings were torn, even when
they lay ready to be sealed. Note, The greatest sign of God's
displeasure against any person or people is his taking his law from
them. The breaking of the tables is the breaking of the staff of beauty
and band ([Zac 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#010.md), [Zac
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#014).md); it leaves a people unchurched
and undone. Some think that Moses sinned in breaking the tables, and
observe that, when men are angry, they are in danger of breaking all
God's commandments; but it rather seems to be an act of justice than of
passion, and we do not find that he himself speaks of it afterwards
([Deu 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#017).md) with any regret. 2. To
convince them that they had betaken themselves to a God that could not
help them, he burnt the calf ([Exo
32:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#020).md), melted it down, and then filed
it to dust; and, that the powder to which it was reduced might be taken
notice of throughout the camp, he strewed it upon that water of which
they all drank. That it might appear that an idol is nothing in the
world ([Co1 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004).md); he reduced this to
atoms, that it might be as near nothing as could be. To show that false
gods cannot help their worshippers, he here showed that this could not
save itself, [Isa 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001.md), [Isa
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#002.md). And to teach us that all the
relics of idolatry ought to be abolished, and that the names of Baalim
should be taken away, the very dust to which it was ground was
scattered. Filings of gold are precious (we say), and therefore are
carefully gathered up; but the filings of the golden calf were odious,
and must be scattered with detestation. Thus the idols of silver and
gold must be cast to the moles and the bats ([Isa
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#020.md); [Isa
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#022).md), and Ephraim shall say, What
have I to do any more with idols? His mixing this powder with their
drink signified to them that the curse they had thereby brought upon
themselves would mingle itself with all their enjoyments, and embitter
them; it would enter into their bowels like water, and like oil into
their bones. The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways;
he shall drink as he brews. These were indeed waters of Marah.

[Exodus 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 32:21</span></span>

Moses, having shown his just indignation against the sin of Israel by
breaking the tables and burning the calf, now proceeds to reckon with
the sinners and to call them to an account, herein acting as the
representative of God, who is not only a holy God, and hates sin, but a
just God, and is engaged in honour to punish it, [Isa
59:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#018.md). Now,

I. He begins with Aaron, as God began with Adam, because he was the
principal person, though not first in the transgression, but drawn into
it. Observe here,

1\. The just reproof Moses gives him, [Exo
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#021.md). He does not order him to be
cut-off, as those ([Exo 32:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#027).md) that
had been the ring-leaders in the sin. Note, A great deal of difference
will be made between those that presumptuously rush into sin and those
that through infirmity are surprised into it, between those that
overtake the fault that flees from them and those that are overtaken in
the fault they flee from. See [Gal
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001.md). Not but that Aaron deserved to be
cut off for this sin, and would have been so if Moses had not interceded
particularly for him, as appears [Deu
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#020.md). And having prevailed with God
for him, to save him from ruin, he here expostulates with him, to bring
him to repentance. He puts Aaron upon considering, (1.) What he had done
to this people: Thou hast brought so great a sin upon them. The sin of
idolatry is a great sin, so great a sin that the evil of it cannot be
expressed; the people, as the first movers, might be said to bring the
sin upon Aaron; but he being a magistrate, who should have suppressed
it, and yet aiding and abetting it, might truly be said to bring it upon
them, because he hardened their hearts and strengthened their hands in
it. It is a shocking thing for governors to humour people in their sins,
and give countenance to that to which they should be a terror. Observe,
in general, Those who bring sin upon others, either by drawing them into
it or encouraging them in it, do more mischief than they are aware of;
we really hate those whom we either bring or suffer sin upon, [Lev
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#017.md). Those that share in sin help to
break their partners, and really ruin one another. (2.) What moved him
to it: What did this people unto thee? He takes it for granted that it
must needs be something more than ordinary that prevailed with Aaron to
do such a thing, thus insinuating an excuse for him, because he knew
that his heart was upright: "What did they? Did they accost thee fairly,
and wheedle thee into it; and durst thou displease thy God, to please
the people? Did they overcome thee by importunity; and hadst thou so
little resolution left as to yield to the stream of a popular clamour?
Did they threaten to stone thee; and couldest not thou have opposed
God's threatenings to theirs, and frightened them worse than they could
frighten thee?" Note, We must never be drawn into sin by any thing that
man can say or do to us, for it will not justify us to say that we were
so drawn in. Men can but tempt us to sin; they cannot force us. Men can
but frighten us; if we do not comply, they cannot hurt us.

2\. The frivolous excuse Aaron makes for himself. We will hope that he
testified his repentance for the sin afterwards better than he did now;
for what he says here has little in it of the language of a penitent. If
a just man fall, he shall rise again, but perhaps not quickly. (1.) He
deprecates the anger of Moses only, whereas he should have deprecated
God's anger in the first place: Let not the anger of my Lord wax hot,
[Exo 32:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#022). (2..md) He lays all the fault
upon the people: They are set on mischief, and they said, Make us gods.
It is natural to us to endeavour thus to transfer our guilt; we have it
in our kind, Adam and Eve did so; sin is a brat that nobody is willing
to own. Aaron was now the chief magistrate and had power over the
people, and yet pleads that the people overpowered him; he that had
authority to restrain them, yet had so little resolution as to yield to
them. (3.) It is well if he did not intend a reflection upon Moses, as
accessory to the sin, by staying so long on the mount, in repeating,
without need, that invidious surmise of the people, As for this Moses,
we know not what has become of him, [Exo
32:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#023). (4..md) He extenuates and conceals
his own share in the sin, as if he had only bidden them break off their
gold that they had about them, intending to make a hasty assay for the
present, and to try what he could make of the gold that was next hand:
and childishly insinuates that when he cast the gold into the fire it
came out, either by accident or by the magic art of some of the mixed
multitude (as the Jewish writers dream), in this shape; but not a word
of his graving and fashioning it, [Exo
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#024.md). But Moses relates to all ages
what he did ([Exo 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#004).md), though he
himself here would not own it. Note, He that covers his sin shall not
prosper, for sooner or later it will be discovered. Well, this was all
Aaron had to say for himself; and he had better have said nothing, for
his defence did but aggravate his offence; and yet he is not only
spared, but preferred; as sin did abound, grace did much more abound.

II\. The people are next to be judged for this sin. The approach of
Moses soon spoiled their sport and turned their dancing into trembling.
Those that hectored Aaron into a compliance with them in their sin durst
not look Moses in the face, nor make the least opposition to the
severity which he thought fit to use both against the idol and against
the idolaters. Note, It is not impossible to make those sins which were
committed with daring presumption appear contemptible, when the insolent
perpetrators of them slink away overwhelmed in their own confusion. The
king that sits upon the throne of judgment scatters away all evil with
his eyes. Observe two things: -

1\. How they were exposed to shame by their sin: The people were naked
([Exo 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#025).md), not so much because they
had some of them lost their ear-rings (that was inconsiderable), but
because they had lost their integrity, and lay under the reproach of
ingratitude to their best benefactor, and a treacherous revolt from
their rightful Lord. It was a shame to them, and a perpetual blot, that
they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox. Other nations
boasted that they were true to their false gods; well may Israel blush
for being false to the true God. Thus were they made naked, stripped of
their ornaments, and exposed to contempt; stripped of their armour, and
liable to insults. Thus our first parents, when they had sinned, became
naked, to their shame. Note, Those that do dishonour to God really bring
the greatest dishonour upon themselves: so Israel here did, and Moses
was concerned to see it, though they themselves were not; he saw that
they were naked.

2\. The course that Moses took to roll away this reproach, not by
concealing the sin, or putting any false colour upon it, but by
punishing it, and so bearing a public testimony against it. Whenever it
should be case in their teeth that they had made a calf in Horeb, they
might have this to say, in answer to those that reproached them, that
though it was true there were those that did so, yet justice was
executed upon them. The government disallowed the sin, and suffered not
the sinners to go unpunished. They did so, but they paid dearly for it.
Thus (said God) thou shalt put the evil away, [Deu
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#005.md). Observe here,

(1.) By whom vengeance was taken - by the children of Levi ([Exo
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#026.md), [Exo
32:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#028).md); not by the immediate hand of
God himself, as on Nadab and Abihu, but by the sword of man, to teach
them that idolatry was an iniquity to be punished by the judge, being a
denial of the God that is above, [Job
31:28](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#028.md); [Deu
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#009.md). It was to be done by the sword
of their own brethren, that the execution of justice might redound more
to the honour of the nation. And, if they must fall now into the hands
of man, better so than flee before their enemies. The innocent must be
culled out to be the executioners of the guilty, that it might be the
more effectual warning to themselves, that they did not the like another
time; and the putting of them upon such an unpleasant service, and so
much against the grain as this must needs be, to kill their next
neighbours, was a punishment to them too for not appearing sooner to
prevent the sin, and make head against it. The Levites particularly were
employed in doing this execution; for, it should seem, there were more
of them than of any other tribe that had kept themselves free from the
contagion, which was the more laudable because Aaron, the head of their
tribe, was so deeply concerned in it. Now here we are told, \[1.\] How
the Levites were called out to this service: Moses stood in the gate of
the camp, the place of judgment; there he displayed a banner, as it
were, because of the truth, to enlist soldiers for God. He proclaimed,
Who is on the Lord's side? The idolaters had set up the golden calf for
their standard, and now Moses set up his, in opposition to them. Now
Moses clad himself with zeal as with a robe, and summoned all those to
appear forthwith that were on God's side, against the golden calf. He
does not proclaim, as Jehu, "Who is on my side ([Kg2
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#032).md), to avenge the indignity done to
me?" but, Who is on the Lord's side? It was God's cause that he espoused
against the evil-doers, [Psa 94:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#016.md).
Note, First, There are two great interests on foot in the world, with
the one or the other of which all the children of men are siding. The
interest of sin and wickedness is the devil's interest, and all wicked
people side with that interest; the interest of truth and holiness is
God's interest, with which all godly people side; and it is a case that
will not admit a neutrality. Secondly, It concerns us all to enquire
whether we are on the Lord's side or not. Thirdly, Those who are on his
side are comparatively but few, and sometimes seem fewer than really
they are. Fourthly, God does sometimes call out those that are on his
side to appear for him, as witnesses, as soldiers, as intercessors.
\[2.\] How they were commissioned for this service ([Exo
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#027).md): Slay every man his brother,
that is, "Slay all those that you know to have been active for the
making and worshipping of the golden calf, though they were your own
nearest relations, or dearest friends." The crime was committed
publicly, the Levites saw who of their acquaintance were concerned in
it, and therefore needed no other direction than their own knowledge
whom to slay. And probably the greatest part of those that were guilty
were known, and known to be so, by some or other of the Levites who were
employed in the execution. Yet, it should seem, they were to slay those
only whom they found abroad in the streets of the camp; for it might be
hoped that those who had retired into their tents were ashamed of what
they had done, and were upon their knees, repenting. Those are marked
for ruin who persist in sin, and are not ashamed of the abominations
they have committed, [Jer 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#012.md). But
how durst the Levites encounter so great a body, who probably were much
enraged by the burning of their calf? It is easy to account for this; a
sense of guilt disheartened the delinquents, and a divine commission
animated the executioners. And one thing that put life into them was
that Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the Lord, that he
may bestow a blessing upon you, thereby intimating to them that they now
stood fair for preferment and that, if they would but signalize
themselves upon this occasion, it would be construed into such a
consecration of themselves to God, and to his service, as would put upon
their tribe a perpetual honour. Those that consecrate themselves to the
Lord he will set apart for himself. Those that do the duty shall have
the dignity; and, if we do signal services for God, he will bestow
especial blessings upon us. There was a blessing designed for the tribe
of Levi; now says Moses, "Consecrate yourselves to the Lord, that you
may qualify yourselves to receive the blessing." The Levites were to
assist in the offering of sacrifice to God; and now they must begin with
the offering of these sacrifices to the honour of divine justice. Those
that are to minister about holy things must be not only sincere and
serious, but warm and zealous, bold and courageous, for God and
godliness. Thus all Christians, but especially ministers, must forsake
father and mother, and prefer the service of Christ and his interest far
before their nearest and dearest relations; for if we love our relations
better than Christ we are not worthy of him. See how this zeal of the
Levites is applauded, [Deu 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#009.md).

(2.) On whom vengeance is taken: There fell of the people that day about
3000 men, [Exo 32:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#028.md). Probably these
were but few, in comparison with the many that were guilty; but these
were the men that headed the rebellion, and were therefore picked out,
to be made examples of, for terror to all others. Those that in the
morning were shouting and dancing before night were dying in their own
blood; such a sudden change do the judgments of God sometimes make with
sinners that are secure and jovial in their sin, as with Belshazzar by
the hand-writing upon the wall. This is written for warning to us. [Co1
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#007.md), Neither be you idolaters, as
were some of them.

[Exodus 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">exo 32:30</span></span>

Moses, having executed justice upon the principal offenders, is here
dealing both with the people and with God.

I. With the people, to bring them to repentance, [Exo
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#030.md).

1\. When some were slain, lest the rest should imagine that, because
they were exempt from the capital punishment, they were therefore looked
upon as free from guilt, Moses here tells the survivors, You have sinned
a great sin, and therefore, though you have escaped this time, except
you repent, you shall all likewise perish. That they might not think
lightly of the sin itself, he calls it a great sin; and that they might
not think themselves innocent, because perhaps they were not all so
deeply guilty as some of those that were put to death, he tells them
all, You have sinned a great sin. The work of ministers is to show
people their sins, and the greatness of their sins. "You have sinned,
and therefore you are undone if your sins be not pardoned, for ever
undone without a Saviour. It is a great sin, and therefore calls for
great sorrow, for it puts you in great danger." To affect them with the
greatness of their sin he intimates to them what a difficult thing it
would be to make up the quarrel which God had with them for it. (1.) It
would not be done, unless he himself went up unto the Lord on purpose,
and gave as long and as solemn attendance as he had done for the
receiving of the law. And yet, (2.) Even so it was but a peradventure
that he should make atonement for them; the case was extremely
hazardous. This should convince us of the great evil there is in sin,
that he who undertook to make atonement found it no easy thing to do it;
he must go up to the Lord with his own blood to make atonement. The
malignity of sin appears in the price of pardons.

2\. Yet it was some encouragement to the people (when they were told
that they had sinned a great sin) to hear that Moses, who had so great
an interest in heaven and so true an affection for them, would go up
unto the Lord to make atonement for them. Consolation should go along
with conviction: first wound, and then heal; first show people the
greatness of their sin, and then make known to them the atonement, and
give them hopes of mercy. Moses will go up unto the Lord, though it be
but a peradventure that he should make atonement. Christ, the great
Mediator, went upon greater certainty than this, for he had lain in the
bosom of the Father, and perfectly knew all his counsels. But to us poor
supplicants it is encouragement enough in prayer for particular mercies
that peradventure we may obtain them, though we have not an absolute
promise. [Zep 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#003.md), It may be, you
shall be hid. In our prayers for others, we should be humbly earnest
with God, though it is but a peradventure that God will give them
repentance, [Ti2 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#025.md).

II\. He intercedes with God for mercy. Observe,

1\. How pathetic his address was. Moses returned unto the Lord, not to
receive further instructions about the tabernacle: there were no more
conferences now about that matter. Thus men's sins and follies make work
for their friends and ministers, unpleasant work, many times, and give
great interruptions to that work which they delight in. Moses in this
address expresses, (1.) His great detestation of the people's sin, [Exo
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#031.md). He speaks as one overwhelmed
with the horror of it: Oh! this people have sinned a great sin. God had
first told him of it ([Exo 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#007).md), and
now he tells God of it, by way of lamentation. He does not call them
God's people, he knew they were unworthy to be called so; but this
people, this treacherous ungrateful people, they have made for
themselves gods of gold. It is a great sin indeed to make gold our god,
as those do that make it their hope, and set their heart on it. He does
not go about to excuse or extenuate the sin; but what he had said to
them by way of conviction he says to God by way of confession: They have
sinned a great sin; he came not to make apologies, but to make
atonement. "Lord, pardon the sin, for it is great," [Psa
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#011). (2..md) His great desire of the
people's welfare ([Exo 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032).md): Yet now
it is not too great a sin for infinite mercy to pardon, and therefore if
thou wilt forgive their sin. What then Moses? It is an abrupt
expression, "If thou wilt, I desire no more; if thou wilt, thou wilt be
praised, I shall be pleased, and abundantly recompensed for my
intercession." It is an expression like that of the dresser of the
vineyard ([Luk 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#009).md), If it bear
fruit; or, If thou wilt forgive, is as much as, "O that thou wouldest
forgive!" as [Luk 19:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#042.md), If thou hadst
known is, O that thou hadst known. "But if not, if the decree has gone
forth, and there is no remedy, but they must be ruined; if this
punishment which has already been inflicted on many is not sufficient
([Co2 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#006).md), but they must all be cut
off, blot me, I pray thee, out of the book which thou hast written;"
that is, "If they must be cut off, let me be cut off with them, and cut
short of Canaan; if all Israel must perish, I am content to perish with
them; let not the land of promise be mine by survivorship." This
expression may be illustrated from [Eze
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#009.md), where this is threatened against
the false prophets, They shall not be written in the writing of the
house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel. God
had told Moses that, if he would not interpose he would make of him a
great nation, [Exo 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#010.md). "No," says
Moses, "I am so far from desiring to see my name and family built up on
the ruins of Israel, that I will choose rather to sink with them. If I
cannot prevent their destruction, let me not see it ([Num
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#015).md); let me not be written among
the living ([Isa 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#003).md), nor among those
that are marked for preservation; even let me die in the last ditch."
Thus he expresses his tender affection for the people, and is a type of
the good Shepherd, that lays down his life for the sheep ([Joh
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011).md), who was to be cut off from the
land of the living for the transgression of my people, [Isa
53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md); [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md). He is also an example of
public-spiritedness to all, especially to those in public stations. All
private interests must be made subordinate to the good and welfare of
communities. It is no great matter what becomes of us and our families
in this world, so that it go well with the church of God, and there be
peace upon Israel. Moses thus importunes for a pardon, and wrestles with
God, not prescribing to him ("If thou wilt not forgive, thou art either
unjust or unkind"); no, he is far from that; but, "If not, let me die
with the Israelites, and the will of the Lord be done."

2\. Observe how prevalent his address was. God would not take him at his
word; no, he will not blot any out of his book but those that by their
wilful disobedience have forfeited the honour of being enrolled in it
([Exo 32:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#033).md); the soul that sins shall
die, and not the innocent for the guilty. This was also an intimation of
mercy to the people, that they should not all be destroyed in a body,
but those only that had a hand in the sin. Thus Moses gets ground by
degrees. God would not at first give him full assurances of his being
reconciled to them, lest, if the comfort of a pardon were too easily
obtained, they should be emboldened to do the like again, and should not
be made sensible enough of the evil of the sin. Comforts are suspended
that convictions may be the deeper impressed: also God would hereby
exercise the faith and zeal of Moses, their great intercessor. Further,
in answer to the address of Moses, (1.) God promises, notwithstanding
this, to go on with his kind intention of giving them the land of
Canaan, the land he had spoken to them of, [Exo
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#034.md). Therefore he sends Moses back
to them to lead them, though they were unworthy of him, and promises
that his angel should go before them, some created angel that was
employed in the common services of the kingdom of providence, which
intimated that they were not to expect any thing for the future to be
done for them out of the common road of providence, not any thing
extraordinary. Moses afterwards obtained a promise of God's special
presence with them ([Exo 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014.md), [Exo
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#017).md); but at present this was all he
could prevail for. (2.) Yet he threatens to remember this sin against
them when hereafter he should see cause to punish them for other sins:
"When I visit, I will visit for this among the rest. Next time I take
the rod in hand, they shall have one stripe the more for this." The Jews
have a saying, grounded on this, that henceforward no judgment fell upon
Israel but there was in it an ounce of the powder of the golden calf. I
see no ground in scripture for the opinion some are of, that God would
not have burdened them with such a multitude of sacrifices and other
ceremonial institutions if they had not provoked him by worshipping the
golden calf. On the contrary, Stephen says that when they made a calf,
and offered sacrifice to the idol, God turned, and gave them up to
worship the host of heaven ([Act 7:41](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#041.md),
[Act 7:42](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#042).md); so that the strange
addictedness of that people to the sin of idolatry was a just judgment
upon them for making and worshipping the golden calf, and a judgment
they were never quite freed from till the captivity of Babylon. See [Rom
1:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#023.md). Note, Many that are not
immediately cut off in their sins are reserved for a further day of
reckoning: vengeance is slow, but sure. For the present, the Lord
plagued the people ([Exo 32:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#035).md),
probably by the pestilence, or some other infectious disease, which was
a messenger of God's wrath, and an earnest of worse. Aaron made the
calf, and yet it is said the people made it, because they worshipped it.
Deos qui rogat, ille facit - He who asks for gods makes them. Aaron was
not plagued, but the people; for his was a sin of infirmity, theirs a
presumptuous sin, between which there is a great difference, not always
discernable to us, but evident to God, whose judgment therefore, we are
sure, is according to truth. Thus Moses prevailed for a reprieve and a
mitigation of the punishment, but could not wholly turn away the wrath
of God. This (some think) bespeaks the inability of the law of Moses to
reconcile men to God and to perfect our peace with him, which was
reserved for Christ to do, in whom alone it is that God so pardons sin
as to remember it no more.
