### [Psalms Chapter 92](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 92:0</span></span>

It is a groundless opinion of some of the Jewish writers (who are
usually free of their conjectures) that this psalm was penned and sung
by Adam in innocency, on the first sabbath. It is inconsistent with the
psalm itself, which speaks of the workers of iniquity, when as yet sin
had not entered. It is probable that it was penned by David, and, being
calculated for the sabbath day, I. Praise, the business of the sabbath,
is here recommended ([Psa 92:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001).md). II.
God's works, which gave occasion for the sabbath, are here celebrated as
great and unsearchable in general ([Psa
92:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#004).md). In particular, with reference
to the works both of providence and redemption, the psalmist sings unto
God both of mercy and judgment, the ruin of sinners and the joy of
saints, three times counterchanged. 1. The wicked shall perish ([Psa
92:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#007).md), but God is eternal ([Psa
92:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#008).md). 2. God's enemies shall be cut
off, but David shall be exalted ([Psa
92:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#009.md), [Psa
92:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#010).md). 3. David's enemies shall be
confounded ([Psa 92:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#011).md), but all the
righteous shall be fruitful and flourishing ([Psa
92:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012).md). In singing this psalm we
must take pleasure in giving to God the glory due to his name, and
triumph in his works.

A psalm or song for the sabbath day.

[Psalms 92:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 92:1</span></span>

This psalm was appointed to be sung, at least it usually was sung, in
the house of the sanctuary on the sabbath day, that day of rest, which
was an instituted memorial of the work of creation, of God's rest from
that work, and the continuance of it in his providence; for the Father
worketh hitherto. Note, 1. The sabbath day must be a day, not only of
holy rest, but of holy work, and the rest is in order to the work. 2.
The proper work of the sabbath is praising God; every sabbath day must
be a thanksgiving-day; and the other services of the day must be in
order to this, and therefore must by no means thrust this into a corner.
One of the Jewish writers refers it to the kingdom of the Messiah, and
calls it, A psalm or song for the age to come, which shall be all
sabbath. Believers, through Christ, enjoy that sabbatism which remains
for the people of God ([Heb 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#009).md), the
beginning of the everlasting sabbath. In these verses,

I. We are called upon and encouraged to praise God ([Psa
92:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001).md): It is a good thing to give
thanks unto the Lord. Praising God is good work: it is good in itself
and good for us. It is our duty, the rent, the tribute, we are to pay to
our great Lord; we are unjust if we withhold it. It is our privilege
that we are admitted to praise God, and have hope to be accepted in it.
It is good, for it is pleasant and profitable, work that is its own
wages; it is the work of angels, the work of heaven. It is good to give
thanks for the mercies we have received, for that is the way of fetching
in further mercy: it is fit to sing to his name who is Most High,
exalted above all blessing and praise. Now observe here, 1. How we must
praise God. We must do it by showing forth his lovingkindness and his
faithfulness. Being convinced of his glorious attributes and
perfections, we must show them forth, as those that are greatly affected
with them ourselves and desire to affect others with them likewise. We
must show forth, not only his greatness and majesty, his holiness and
justice, which magnify him and strike an awe upon us, but his
lovingkindness and his faithfulness; for his goodness is his glory ([Exo
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#018.md), [Exo
33:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#019).md), and by these he proclaims his
name. His mercy and truth are the great supports of our faith and hope,
and the great encouragements of our love and obedience; these therefore
we must show forth as our pleas in prayer and the matter of our joy.
This was then done, not only by singing, but by music joined with it,
upon an instrument of ten strings ([Psa
92:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#003).md); but then it was to be with a
solemn sound, not that which was gay, and apt to dissipate the spirits,
but that which was grave, and apt to fix them. 2. When we must praise
God - in the morning and every night, not only on sabbath days, but
every day; it is that which the duty of every day requires. We must
praise God, not only in public assemblies, but in secret, and in our
families, showing forth, to ourselves and those about us, his
lovingkindness and faithfulness. We must begin and end every day with
praising God, must give him thanks every morning, when we are fresh and
before the business of the day comes in upon us, and every night, when
we are again composed and retired, and are recollecting ourselves; we
must give him thanks every morning for the mercies of the night and
every night for the mercies of the day; going out and coming in we must
bless God.

II\. We have an example set before us in the psalmist himself, both to
move us to and to direct us in this work ([Psa
92:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#004).md): Thou, Lord, hast made me glad
through thy work. Note, 1. Those can best recommend to others the duty
of praise who have themselves experienced the pleasantness of it. "God's
works are to be praised, for they have many a time rejoiced my heart;
and therefore, whatever others may think of them, I must think well and
speak well of them." 2. If God has given us the joy of his works, there
is all the reason in the world why we should give him the honour of
them. Has he made our hearts glad? Let us then make his praises
glorious. Has God made us glad through the works of his providence for
us, and of his grace in us, and both through the great work of
redemption? (1.) Let us thence fetch encouragement for our faith and
hope; so the psalmist does: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.
From a joyful remembrance of what God has done for us we may raise a
joyful prospect of what he will do, and triumph in the assurance of it,
triumph over all opposition, [Th2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013.md), [Th2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#014). (2..md) Let us thence fetch matter
for holy adorings and admirings of God ([Psa
92:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#005).md): O Lord! how great are thy works
- great beyond conception, beyond expression, the products of great
power and wisdom, of great consequence and importance! men's works are
nothing to them. We cannot comprehend the greatness of God's works, and
therefore must reverently and awfully wonder at them, and even stand
amazed at the magnificence of them. "Men's works are little and
trifling, for their thoughts are shallow; but, Lord, thy works are great
and such as cannot be measured; for thy thoughts are very deep and such
as cannot be fathomed." God's counsels as much exceed the contrivances
of our wisdom as his works do the efforts of our power. His thoughts are
above our thoughts, as his ways are above our ways, [Isa
55:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#009.md). O the depth of God's designs!
[Rom 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033.md). The greatness of God's
works should lead us to consider the depth of his thoughts, that counsel
of his own will according to which he does all things - what a compass
his thoughts fetch and to what a length they reach!

III\. We are admonished not to neglect the works of God, by the
character of those who do so, [Psa
92:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#006.md). Those are fools, they are
brutish, who do not know, who do not understand, how great God's works
are, who will not acquaint themselves with them, nor give him the glory
of them; they regard not the work of the Lord nor consider the operation
of his hands ([Psa 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#005).md);
particularly, they understand not the meaning of their own prosperity
(which is spoken of [Psa 92:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#007).md); they
take it as a pledge of their happiness, whereas it is a preparative for
their ruin. If there are so many who know not the designs of Providence,
nor care to know them, those who through grace are acquainted with them,
and love to be so, have the more reason to be thankful.

[Psalms 92:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 92:7</span></span>

The psalmist had said ([Psa 92:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#004).md) that
from the works of God he would take occasion to triumph; and here he
does so.

I. He triumphs over God's enemies ([Psa
92:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#007.md), [Psa
92:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#009.md), [Psa
92:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#011).md), triumphs in the foresight of
their destruction, not as it would be the misery of his
fellow-creatures, but as it would redound to the honour of God's justice
and holiness. He is confident of the ruin of sinners, 1. Though they are
flourishing ([Psa 92:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#007).md): When the
wicked spring as the grass in spring (so numerous, so thickly sown, so
green, and growing so fast), and all the workers of iniquity do flourish
in pomp, and power, and all the instances of outward prosperity, are
easy and many, and succeed in their enterprises, one would think that
all this was in order to their being happy, that it was a certain
evidence of God's favour and an earnest of something as good or better
in reserve: but it is quite otherwise; it is that they shall be
destroyed for ever. The very prosperity of fools shall slay them, [Pro
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#032.md). The sheep that are designed for
the slaughter are put into the fattest pasture. 2. Though they are
daring, [Psa 92:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#009.md). They are thy
enemies, and impudently avow themselves to be so. They are contrary to
God, and they fight against God. They are in rebellion against his crown
and dignity, and therefore it is easy to foresee that they shall perish;
for who ever hardened his heart against God and prospered? Note, All the
impenitent workers of iniquity shall be deemed and taken as God's
enemies, and as such they shall perish and be scattered. Christ reckons
those his enemies that will not have him to reign over them; and they
shall be brought forth and slain before him. The workers of iniquity are
now associated, and closely linked together, in a combination against
God and religion; but they shall be scattered, and disabled to help one
another against the just judgment of God. In the world to come they
shall be separated from the congregation of the righteous; so the
Chaldee, [Psa 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#005.md). 3. Though they had
a particular malice against the psalmist, and, upon that account, he
might be tempted to fear them, yet he triumphs over them ([Psa
92:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#011).md): "My eye shall see my desire on
my enemies that rise up against me; I shall see them not only disabled
from doing me any further mischief, but reckoned with for the mischief
they have done me, and brought either to repentance or ruin:" and this
was his desire concerning them. In the Hebrew it is no more than thus,
My eye shall look on my enemies, and my ear shall hear of the wicked. He
does not say what he shall see or what he shall hear, but he shall see
and hear that in which God will be glorified and in which he will
therefore be satisfied. This perhaps has reference to Christ, to his
victory over Satan, death, and hell, the destruction of those that
persecuted and crucified him, and opposed his gospel, and to the final
ruin of the impenitent at the last day. Those that rise up against
Christ will fall before him and be made his footstool.

II\. He triumphs in God, and his glory and grace. 1. In the glory of God
([Psa 92:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#008).md): "But thou, O Lord! art
most high for evermore. The workers of iniquity who fight against us may
be high for a time, and think to carry all before them with a high hand,
but thou art high, most high, for evermore. Their height will be humbled
and brought down, but thine is everlasting." Let us not therefore fear
the pride and power of evil men, nor be discouraged by their impotent
menaces, for the moth shall eat them up as a garment, but God's
righteousness shall be for ever, [Isa
51:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#007.md), [Isa
51:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#008.md). 2. In the grace of God, his
favour and the fruits of it, (1.) To himself ([Psa
92:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#010).md): "Thou, O Lord! that art
thyself most high, shalt exalt my horn." The great God is the fountain
of honour, and he, being high for evermore, himself will exalt his
people for ever, for he is the praise of all his saints, [Psa
148:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#014.md). The wicked are forbidden to
lift up the horn ([Psa 75:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#004.md), [Psa
75:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#005).md), but those that serve God and
the interest of his kingdom with their honour or power, and commit it to
him to keep it, to raise it, to use it, and to dispose of it, as he
pleases, may hope that he will exalt their horn as the horn of a
unicorn, to the greatest height, either in this world or the other: My
horn shalt thou exalt, when thy enemies perish; for then shall the
righteous shine forth as the sun, when the wicked shall be doomed to
shame and everlasting contempt. He adds, I shall be anointed with fresh
oil, which denotes a fresh confirmation in his office to which he had
been anointed, or abundance of plenty, so that he should have fresh oil
as often as he pleased, or renewed comforts to revive him when his
spirits drooped. Grace is the anointing of the Spirit; when this is
given to help in the time of need, and is received, as there is
occasion, from the fulness that is in Christ Jesus, we are then anointed
with fresh oil. Some read it, When I grow old thou shalt anoint me with
fresh oil. My old age shalt thou exalt with rich mercy; so the
Septuagint. Compare [Psa 92:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#014.md), They
shall bring forth fruit in old age. The comforts of God's Spirit, and
the joys of his salvation, shall be a refreshing oil to the hoary heads
that are found in the way of righteousness. (2.) To all the saints. They
are here represented as trees of righteousness, [Isa
61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003.md); [Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md). Observe, \[1.\] The good place
they are fixed in; they are planted in the house of the Lord, [Psa
92:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#013.md). The trees of righteousness do
not grow of themselves; they are planted, not in common soil, but in
paradise, in the house of the Lord. Trees are not usually planted in a
house; but God's trees are said to be planted in his house because it is
from his grace, by his word and Spirit, that they receive all the sap
and virtue that keep them alive and make them fruitful. They fix
themselves to holy ordinances, take root in them, abide by them, put
themselves under the divine protection, and bring forth all their fruits
to God's honour and glory. \[2.\] The good plight they shall be kept in.
It is here promised, First, That they shall grow, [Psa
92:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012.md). Where God gives true grace he
will give more grace. God's trees shall grow higher, like the cedars,
the tall cedars in Lebanon; they shall grow nearer heaven, and with a
holy ambition shall aspire towards the upper world; they shall grow
stronger, like the cedars, and fitter for use. He that has clean hands
shall be stronger and stronger. Secondly, That they shall flourish, both
in the credit of their profession and in the comfort and joy of their
own souls. They shall be cheerful themselves and respected by all about
them. They shall flourish like the palm-tree, which has a stately body
([Sol 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#007).md), and large boughs, [Lev
23:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#040.md); [Jdg
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#005.md). Dates, the fruit of it, are very
pleasant, but it is especially alluded to here as being ever green. The
wicked flourish as the grass ([Psa
92:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#007).md), which is soon withered, but the
righteous as the palm-tree, which is long-lived and which the winter
does not change. It has been said of the palm-tree, Sub pondere crescit
- The more it is pressed down the more it grows; so the righteous
flourish under their burdens; the more they are afflicted the more they
multiply. Being planted in the house of the Lord (there their root is),
they flourish in the courts of our God - there their branches spread.
Their life is hid with Christ in God. But their light also shines before
men. It is desirable that those who have a place should have a name in
God's house, and within his walls, [Isa
56:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#005.md). Let good Christians aim to
excel, that they may be eminent and may flourish, and so may adorn the
doctrine of God our Saviour, as flourishing trees adorn the courts of a
house. And let those who flourish in God's courts give him the glory of
it; it is by virtue of this promise, They shall be fat and flourishing.
Their flourishing without is from a fatness within, from the root and
fatness of the good olive, [Rom 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017.md).
Without a living principle of grace in the heart the profession will not
be long flourishing; but where that is the leaf also shall not wither,
[Psa 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md). The trees of the Lord are
full of sap, [Psa 104:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#016.md). See [Hos
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#005.md), [Hos
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#006.md). Thirdly, That they shall be
fruitful. Were there nothing but leaves upon them, they would not be
trees of any value; but they shall still bring forth fruit. The products
of sanctification, all the instances of a lively devotion and a useful
conversation, good works, by which God is glorified and others are
edified, these are the fruits of righteousness, in which it is the
privilege, as well as the duty, of the righteous to abound; and their
abounding in them is the matter of a promise as well as of a command. It
is promised that they shall bring forth fruit in old age. Other trees,
when they are old, leave off bearing, but in God's trees the strength of
grace does not fail with the strength of nature. The last days of the
saints are sometimes their best days, and their last work is their best
work. This indeed shows that they are upright; perseverance is the
surest evidence of sincerity. But it is here said to show that the Lord
is upright ([Psa 92:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#015).md), that he is
true to his promises and faithful to every word that he has spoken, and
that he is constant to the work which he has begun. As it is by the
promises that believers first partake of a divine nature, so it is by
the promises that that divine nature is preserved and kept up; and
therefore the power it exerts is an evidence that the Lord is upright,
and so he will show himself with an upright man, [Psa
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#025.md). This the psalmist triumphs in:
"He is my rock and there is no unrighteousness in him. I have chosen him
for my rock on which to build, in the clefts of which to take shelter,
on the top of which to set my feet. I have found him a rock, strong and
stedfast, and his word as firm as a rock. I have found" (and let every
one speak as he finds) "that there is no unrighteousness in him." He is
as able, and will be as kind, as his word makes him to be. All that ever
trusted in God found him faithful and all-sufficient, and none were ever
made ashamed of their hope in him.
