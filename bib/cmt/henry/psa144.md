### [Psalms Chapter 144](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 144:0</span></span>

The four preceding psalms seem to have been penned by David before his
accession to the crown, when he was persecuted by Saul; this seems to
have been penned afterwards, when he was still in trouble (for there is
no condition in this world privileged with an exemption from trouble),
the neighbouring nations molesting him and giving him disturbance,
especially the Philistines, [Sa2 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#017.md).
In this psalm, I. He acknowledges, with triumph and thankfulness, the
great goodness of God to him in advancing him to the government ([Psa
144:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001).md). II. He prays to God to help
him against the enemies who threatened him ([Psa
144:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#005.md) and again [Psa
144:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#011).md). III. He rejoices in the
assurance of victory over them ([Psa
144:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#009.md), [Psa
144:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#010).md). IV. He prays for the
prosperity of his own kingdom, and pleases himself with the hopes of it
([Psa 144:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#012).md). In singing this
psalm we may give God the glory of our spiritual privileges and
advancements, and fetch in help from him against our spiritual enemies;
we may pray for the prosperity of our souls, of our families, and of our
land; and, in the opinion of some of the Jewish writers, we may refer
the psalm to the Messiah and his kingdom.

A psalm of David.

[Psalms 144:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 144:1</span></span>

Here, I. David acknowledges his dependence upon God and his obligations
to him, [Psa 144:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001.md), [Psa
144:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#002.md). A prayer for further mercy is
fitly begun with a thanksgiving for former mercy; and when we are
waiting upon God to bless us we should stir up ourselves to bless him.
He gives to God the glory of two things: -

1\. What he was to him: Blessed be the Lord my rock ([Psa
144:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001).md), my goodness, my fortress, [Psa
144:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#002.md). He has in the covenant engaged
himself to be so, and encouraged us, accordingly, to depend upon him;
all the saints, who by faith have made him theirs, have found him not
only to answer but to out do their expectations. David speaks of it here
as the matter of his trust, and that which made him easy, as the matter
of his triumph, and that which made him glad, and in which he gloried.
See how he multiplies words to express the satisfaction he had in God
and his interest in him. (1.) "He is my strength, on whom I stay, and
from whom I have power both for my work and for my warfare, my rock to
build on, to take shelter in." Even when we are weak we may be strong in
the Lord and in the power of his might. (2.) "My goodness, not only good
to me, but my chief good, in whose favour I place my felicity, and who
is the author of all the goodness that is in me, and from whom comes
every good and perfect gift." (3.) "My fortress, and my high tower, in
whom I think myself as safe as ever any prince thought himself in a
castle or strong-hold." David had formerly sheltered himself in
strong-holds at En-gedi ([Sa1 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#029).md),
which perhaps were natural fastnesses. He had lately made himself master
of the strong-hold of Zion, which was fortified by art, and he dwelt in
the fort ([Sa2 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#007.md), [Sa2
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#009).md), but he depends not on these.
"Lord," says he, "thou art my fortress and my high tower." The divine
attributes and promises are fortifications to a believer, far exceeding
those either of nature or art. (4.) My deliverer, and, as it is in the
original, very emphatically, my deliverer to me, "not only a deliverer I
have interest in, but who is always nigh unto me and makes all my
deliverances turn to my real benefit." (5.) "My shield, to guard me
against all the malignant darts that my enemies let fly at me, not only
my fortress at home, but my shield abroad in the field of battle."
Wherever a believer goes he carries his protection along with him. Fear
not, Abram, I am thy shield.

2\. What he had done for him. He was bred a shepherd, and seems not to
have been designed by his parents, or himself for any thing more. But,
(1.) God had made him a soldier. His hands had been used to the crook
and his fingers to the harp, but God taught his hands to war and his
fingers to fight, because he designed him for Israel's champion; and
what God calls men to he either finds them or makes them fit for. Let
the men of war give God the glory of all their military skill; the same
that teaches the meanest husbandman his art teaches the greatest general
his. It is a pity that any whose fingers God has taught to fight should
fight against him or his kingdom among men. Those have special reason to
acknowledge God with thankfulness who prove to be qualified for services
which they themselves never thought of. (2.) God had made him a
sovereign prince, had taught him to wield the sceptre as well as the
sword, to rule as well as fight, the harder and nobler art of the two:
He subdueth my people under me. The providence of God is to be
acknowledged in making people subject to their prince, and so preserving
the order and benefit of societies. There was a special hand of God
inclining the people of Israel to be subject to David, pursuant to the
promise God had made him; and it was typical of that great act of divine
grace, the bringing of souls into subjection to the Lord Jesus and
making them willing in the day of his power.

II\. He admires God's condescension to man and to himself in particular
([Psa 144:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#003.md), [Psa
144:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#004).md): "Lord, what is man, what a
poor little thing is he, that thou takest knowledge of him, that thou
makest account of him, that he falls so much under thy cognizance and
care, and that thou hast such a tender regard to any of that mean and
worthless race as thou hast had to me!" Considering the many disgraces
which the human nature lies under, we have reason to admire the honours
God has put upon mankind in general (the saints especially, some in a
particular manner, as David) and upon the Messiah (to whom those words
are applied, [Heb 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#006).md), who was highly
exalted because he humbled himself to be found in fashion as a man, and
has authority to execute judgment because he is the Son of man. A
question to this purport David asked ([Psa
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004).md), and he illustrated the wonder by
the consideration of the great dignity God has placed man in ([Psa
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005).md), Thou hast crowned him with glory
and honour. Here he illustrates it by the consideration of the meanness
and mortality of man, notwithstanding the dignity put upon him ([Psa
144:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#004).md): Man is like to vanity; so
frail is he, so weak, so helpless, compassed about with so many
infirmities, and his continuance here so very short and uncertain, that
he is as like as may be to vanity itself. Nay, he is vanity, he is so at
his best estate. His days have little substance in them, considering how
many of the thoughts and cares of an immortal soul are employed about a
poor dying body; they are as a shadow, dark and flitting, transitory and
finishing with the sun, and, when that sets, resolving itself into all
shadow. They are as a shadow that passeth away, and there is no loss of
it. David puts himself into the number of those that are thus mean and
despicable.

III\. He begs of God to strengthen him and give him success against the
enemies that invaded him, [Psa
144:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#005.md). He does not specify who they
were that he was in fear of, but says, Scatter them, destroy them. God
knew whom he meant, though he did not name them. But afterwards he
describes them ([Psa 144:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#007.md), [Psa
144:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#008).md): "They are strange children,
Philistines, aliens, bad neighbours to Israel, heathens, whom we are
bound to be strange to and not to make any leagues with, and who
therefore carry it strangely towards us." Notwithstanding the advantages
with which God had blessed David's arms against them, they were still
vexatious and treacherous, and men that one could put no confidence in:
"One cannot take their word, for their mouth speaketh vanity; nay, if
they give their hand upon it, or offer their hand to help you, there is
no trusting them; for their right hand is a right hand of falsehood."
Against such as these we cannot defend ourselves, but we may depend on
the God of truth and justice, who hates falsehood, to defend us from
them. 1. David prays that God would appear, that he would do something
extraordinary, for the conviction of those who preferred their
dunghill-deities before the God of Israel ([Psa
144:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#005).md): "Bow thy heavens, O Lord! and
make it evident that they are indeed thine, and that thou art the Lord
of them, [Isa 66:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001.md). Let thy providence
threaten my enemies, and look black upon them, as the clouds do on the
earth when they are thick, and hang very low, big with a storm. Fight
against those that fight against us, so that it may visibly appear that
thou art for us. Touch the mountains, our strong and stately enemies,
and let them smoke. Show thyself by the ministry of thy angels, as thou
didst upon Mount Sinai." 2. That he would appear against his enemies,
that he would fight from heaven against them, as sometimes he had done,
by lightnings, which are his arrows (his fiery darts, against which the
hardest steel is no armour of proof, so penetrating is the force of
lightning), that he himself would shoot these arrows, who, we are sure,
never misses his mark, but hits where he aims. 3. That he would appear
for him, [Psa 144:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#007.md). He begs for their
destruction, in order to his own deliverance and the repose of his
people: "Send thy hand, thy power, from above, for that way we look for
help; rid me and deliver me out of these great waters that are ready to
overflow me." God's time to help his people is when they are sinking and
all other helps fail.

[Psalms 144:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 144:9</span></span>

The method is the same in this latter part of the psalm as in the
former; David first gives glory to God and then begs mercy from him.

I. He praises God for the experiences he had had of his goodness to him
and the encouragements he had to expect further mercy from him, [Psa
144:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#009.md), [Psa
144:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#010.md). In the midst of his complaints
concerning the power and treachery of his enemies, here is a holy
exultation in his God: I will sing a new song to thee, O God! a song of
praise for new mercies, for those compassions that are new every
morning. Fresh favours call for fresh returns of thanks; nay, we must
praise God for the mercies we hope for by his promise as well as those
we have received by his providence, [Ch2
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#020.md), [Ch2
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#021.md). He will join music with his
songs of praise, to express and excite his holy joy in God; he will
praise God upon a psaltery of ten strings, in the best manner, thinking
all little enough to set forth the praises of God. He tells us what this
new song shall be ([Psa 144:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#010).md): It is
he that giveth salvation unto kings. This intimates, 1. That great kings
cannot save themselves without him. Kings have their life-guards, and
have armies at command, and all the means of safety that can be devised;
but, after all, it is God that gives them their salvation, and secures
them by those means, which he could do, if there were occasion, without
them, [Psa 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#016.md). Kings are the
protectors of their people, but it is God that is their protector. How
much service do they owe him then with their power who gives them all
their salvations! 2. That good kings, who are his ministers for the good
of their subjects, shall be protected and saved by him. He has engaged
to give salvation to those kings that are his subjects and rule for him;
witness the great things he had done for David his servant, whom he had
many a time delivered from the hurtful sword, to which Saul's malice,
and his own zeal for the service of his country, had often exposed him.
This may refer to Christ the Son of David, and then it is a new song
indeed, a New Testament song. God delivered him from the hurtful sword,
upheld him as his servant, and brought him off a conqueror over all the
powers of darkness, [Isa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md); [Isa
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008.md). To him he gave salvation, not
for himself only, but for us, raising him up to be a horn of salvation.

II\. He prays for the continuance of God's favour.

1\. That he might be delivered from the public enemies, [Psa
144:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#011.md). Here he repeats his prayer and
plea, [Psa 144:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#007.md), [Psa
144:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#008.md). His persecutors were still of
the same character, false and perfidious, and who would certainly
over-reach an honest man and be too hard for him: "Therefore, Lord, do
thou deliver me from them, for they are a strange sort of people."

2\. That he might see the public peace and prosperity: "Lord, let us
have victory, that we may have quietness, which we shall never have
while our enemies have it in their power to do us mischief." David, as a
king, here expresses the earnest desire he had of the welfare of his
people, wherein he was a type of Christ, who provides effectually for
the good of his chosen. We have here,

(1.) The particular instances of that public prosperity which David
desired for his people. \[1.\] A hopeful progeny ([Psa
144:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#012).md): "That our sons and our
daughters may be in all respects such as we could wish." He means not
those only of his own family, but those of his subjects, that are the
seed of the next generation. It adds much to the comfort and happiness
of parents in this world to see their children promising and likely to
do well. First, It is pleasant to see our sons as plants grown up in
their youth, as olive-plants ([Psa
128:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001) :.md), the planting of the Lord
([Isa 61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003).md), - to see them as plants,
not as weeds, not as thorns, - to see them as plants growing great, not
withered and blasted, - to see them of a healthful constitution, a quick
capacity, a towardly disposition, and especially of a pious inclination,
likely to bring forth fruit unto God in their day, - to see them in
their youth, their growing time, increasing in every thing that is good,
growing wiser and better, till they grow strong in spirit. Secondly, It
is no less desirable to see our daughters as corner-stones, or
corner-pillars, polished after the similitude of a palace, or temple. By
daughters families are united and connected, to their mutual strength,
as the parts of a building are by the corner-stones; and when they are
graceful and beautiful both in body and mind they are then polished
after the similitude of a nice and curious structure. When we see our
daughters well-established and stayed with wisdom and discretion, as
corner-stones are fastened in the building, - when we see them by faith
united to Christ, as the chief corner-stone, adorned with the graces of
God's Spirit, which are the polishing of that which is naturally rough,
and become women professing godliness, - when we see them purified and
consecrated to God as living temples, we think ourselves happy in them.
\[2.\] Great plenty. Numerous families increase the care, perhaps more
than the comfort, where there is not sufficient for their maintenance;
and therefore he prays for a growing estate with a growing family.
First, That their store-houses might be well-replenished with the fruits
and products of the earth: That our garners may be full, like those of
the good householder, who brings out of them things new and old (those
things that are best new he has in that state, those that are best when
they are kept he has in that state), - that we may have in them all
manner of stores, for ourselves and our friends, - that, living
plentifully, we may live not luxuriously, for then we abuse our plenty,
but cheerfully and usefully, - that, having abundance, we may be
thankful to God, generous to our friends, and charitable to the poor;
otherwise, what profit is it to have our garners full? [Jam
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#003.md). Secondly, That their flocks might
greatly increase: That our sheep may bring forth thousands, and ten
thousands, in our folds. Much of the wealth of their country consisted
in their flocks ([Pro 27:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#026).md), and this
is the case with ours too, else wool would not be, as it is, a staple
commodity. The increase of our cattle is a blessing in which God is to
be acknowledged. Thirdly, That their beasts designed for service might
be fit for it: That our oxen may be strong to labour in the plough, that
they may be fat and fleshy (so some), in good working case. We were none
of us made to be idle, and therefore we should pray for bodily health,
not that we may be easy and take our pleasures, but that we may be
strong to labour, that we may do the work of our place and day, else we
are worse than the beasts; for when they are strong it is for labour.
\[3.\] An uninterrupted peace. First, That there be no war, no breaking
in of invaders, no going out of deserters. "Let not our enemies break in
upon us; let us not have occasion to march out against them." War brings
with it abundance of mischiefs, whether it be offensive or defensive.
Secondly, That there be no oppression nor faction - no complaining in
our streets, that the people may have no cause to complain either of
their government or of one another, nor may be so peevish as to complain
without cause. It is desirable thus to dwell in quiet habitations.

(2.) His reflection upon this description of the prosperity of the
nation, which he so much desired ([Psa
144:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#015).md): Happy are the people that are
in such a case (but it is seldom so, and never long so), yea, happy are
the people whose God is the Lord. The relation of a people to God as
theirs is here spoken of either, \[1.\] As that which is the fountain
whence all those blessings flow. Happy are the Israelites if they
faithfully adhere to the Lord as their God, for they may expect to be in
such a case. National piety commonly brings national prosperity; for
nations as such, in their national capacity, are capable of rewards and
punishments only in this life. Or, \[2.\] As that which is abundantly
preferable to all these enjoyments. The psalmist began to say, as most
do, Happy are the people that are in such a case; those are blessed that
prosper in the world. But he immediately corrects himself: Yea, rather,
happy are the people whose God is the Lord, who have his favour, and
love, and grace, according to the tenour of the covenant, though they
have not abundance of this world's goods. As all this, and much more,
cannot make us happy, unless the Lord be our God, so, if he be, the want
of this, the loss of this, nay, the reverse of this, cannot make us
miserable.
