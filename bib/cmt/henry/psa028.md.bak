### [Psalms Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 28:0</span></span>

The former part of this psalm is the prayer of a saint militan and now
in distress ([Psa 28:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001).md), to which is
added the doom of God's implacable enemies ([Psa
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#004.md), [Psa
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#005).md). The latter part of the psalm is
the thanksgiving of a saint triumphant, and delivered out of his
distresses ([Psa 28:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#006).md), to which is
added a prophetical prayer for all God's faithful loyal subjects ([Psa
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#009).md). So that it is hard to say which
of these two conditions David was in when he penned it. Some think he
was now in trouble seeking God, but at the same time preparing to praise
him for his deliverance, and by faith giving him thanks for it, before
it was wrought. Others think he was now in triumph, but remembered, and
recorded for his own and others' benefit, the prayers he made when he
was in affliction, that the mercy might relish the better, when it
appeared to be an answer to them.

A psalm of David.

[Psalms 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 28:1</span></span>

In these verses David is very earnest in prayer.

I. He prays that God would graciously hear and answer him, now that, in
his distress, he called upon him, [Psa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001.md), [Psa
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002.md). Observe his faith in prayer: O
Lord, my rock, denoting his belief of God's power (he is a rock) and his
dependence upon that power - "He is my rock, on whom I build my hope."
Observe his fervency in prayer: "To thee will I cry, as one in earnest,
being ready to sink, unless thou come in with seasonable succour." And
observe how solicitous he is to obtain an answer: "Be not silent to me,
as one angry at my prayers, [Psa 80:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#004.md).
Lord, speak to me, answer me with good words and comfortable words ([Zac
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#013).md); though the thing I pray for has
not been given me, yet let God speak to me joy and gladness, and make me
to hear them. Lord, speak for me, in answer to my prayers, plead my
cause, command deliverances for me, and thus hear and answer the voice
of my supplications." Two things he pleads: - 1. The sad despair he
should be in if God slighted him: "If thou be silent to me, and I have
not the tokens of thy favour, I am like those that go down into the pit
(that is, I am a dead man, lost and undone); if God be not my friend,
appear not to me and appear not for me, my hope and my help will have
perished." Nothing can be so cutting, so killing, to a gracious soul, as
the want of God's favour and the sense of his displeasure. I shall be
like those that go down to hell (so some understand it); for what is the
misery of the damned but this, that God is ever silent to them and deaf
to their cry? Those are in some measure qualified for God's favour, and
may expect it, who are thus possessed with a dread of his wrath, and to
whom his frowns are worse than death. 2. The good hopes he had that God
would favour him: I lift up my hands towards thy holy oracle, which
denotes, not only an earnest desire, but an earnest expectation, thence
to receive an answer of peace. The most holy place within the veil is
here, as elsewhere, called the oracle; there the ark and the mercy-seat
were, there God was said to dwell between the cherubim, and thence he
spoke to his people, [Num 7:89](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#089.md). That
was a type of Christ, and it is to him that we must lift up our eyes and
hands, for through him all good comes from God to us. It was also a
figure of heaven ([Heb 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024).md); and from
God as our Father in heaven we are taught to expect an answer to our
prayers. The scriptures are called the oracles of God, and to them we
must have an eye in our prayers and expectations. There is the word on
which God hath caused and encouraged us to hope.

II\. He deprecates the doom of wicked people, as before ([Psa
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#009.md), "Gather not my soul with
sinners): Lord, I attend thy holy oracle, draw me not away from that
with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity," [Psa
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#003.md). 1. "Save me from being entangled
in the snares they have laid for me. They flatter and cajole me, and
speak peace to me; but they have a design upon me, for mischief is in
their heart; they aim to disturb me, nay, to destroy me. Lord, suffer me
not to be drawn away and ruined by their cursed plots; for they have,
can have, no power, no success, against me, except it be given them from
above." 2. "Save me from being infected with their sins and from doing
as they do. Let me not be drawn away by their fallacious arguments, or
their allurements, from the holy oracle (where I desire to dwell all the
days of my life), to practise any wicked works;" see [Psa
141:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#004.md). "Lord, never leave me to
myself, to use such arts of deceit and treachery for my safety as they
use to my ruin. Let no event of Providence be an invincible temptation
to me, to draw me either into the imitation or into the interest of
wicked people." Good men dread the way of sinners; the best are sensible
of the danger they are in of being drawn aside into it; and therefore we
should all pray earnestly to God for his grace to keep us in our
integrity. 3. "Save me from being involved in their doom; let me not be
led forth with the workers of iniquity, for I am not one of those that
speak peace while war is in their hearts." Note, Those that are careful
not to partake with sinners in their sins have reason to hope that they
shall not partake with them in their plagues, [Rev
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004.md).

III\. He imprecates the just judgments of God upon the workers of
iniquity ([Psa 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#004).md): Give them
according to their deeds. This is not the language of passion or
revenge, nor is it inconsistent with the duty of praying for our
enemies. But, 1. Thus he would show how far he was from complying with
the workers of iniquity, and with what good reason he had begged not to
be drawn away with them, because he was convinced that they could not be
made more miserable then to be dealt with according to their deeds. 2.
Thus he would express his zeal for the honour of God's justice in the
governing world. "Lord, they think all well that they do, and justify
themselves in their wicked practices. Lord, give them after the work of
their hands, and so undeceive those about them, who think there is no
harm in what they do because it goes unpunished," [Psa
94:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#001.md), [Psa
94:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#002.md). 3. This prayer is a prophecy
that God will, sooner or later, render to all impenitent sinners
according to their deserts. If what has been done amiss be not undone by
repentance, there will certainly come a reckoning day, when God will
render to every man who persists in his evil deeds according to them. It
is a prophecy particularly of the destruction of destroyers: "They speak
peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts; Lord, give
them according to their deeds, let the spoilers be spoiled, and let
those be treacherously dealt with who have thus dealt treacherously;"
see [Isa 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001.md); [Rev
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#006.md); [Rev
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#010.md). Observe, He foretels that God
will reward them, not only according to their deed, but according to the
wickedness of their endeavours; for sinners shall be reckoned with, not
only for the mischief they have done, but for the mischief they would
have done, which they designed, and did what they could to effect. And,
if God go by this rule in dealing with the wicked, surely he will do so
in dealing with the righteous, and will reward them, not only for the
good they have done, but for the good they have endeavoured to do,
though they could not accomplish it.

IV\. He foretels their destruction for their contempt of God and his
hand ([Psa 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#005).md): "Because they regard
not the works of the Lord and the operations of his hands, by which he
manifests himself and speaks to the children of men, he will destroy
them in this world and in the other, and not build them up." Note, A
stupid regardlessness of the works of God is the cause of their ruin.
Why do men question the being or attributes of God, but because they do
not duly regard his handiworks, which declare his glory, and in which
the invisible things of him are clearly seen? Why do men forget God, and
live without him, nay, affront God, and live in rebellion against him,
but because they consider not the instances of that wrath of his which
is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
men? Why do the enemies of God's people hate and persecute them, and
devise mischief against them, but because they regard not the works God
has wrought for his church, by which he has made it appear how dear it
is to him? See [Isa 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012.md).

In singing this we must arm ourselves against all temptations to join
with the workers of iniquity, and animate ourselves against all the
troubles we may be threatened with by the workers of iniquity.

[Psalms 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 28:6</span></span>

In these verses,

I. David gives God thanks for the audience of his prayers as
affectionately as a few verses before he had begged it: Blessed be the
Lord, [Psa 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#006.md). How soon are the
saints' sorrows turned into songs and their prayers into praises! It was
in faith that David prayed ([Psa
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002).md), Hear the voice of my
supplications; and by the same faith he gives thanks ([Psa
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#006).md) that God has heard the voice of
his supplications. Note, 1. Those that pray in faith may rejoice in
hope. "He hath heard me (graciously accepted me) and I am as sure of a
real answer as if I had it already." 2. What we win by prayer we must
wear by praise. Has God heard our supplications? Let us then bless his
name.

II\. He encourages himself to hope in God for the perfecting of every
thing that concerned him. Having given to God the glory of his grace
([Psa 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#006).md), he is humbly bold to take
the comfort of it, [Psa 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#007.md). This is
the method of attaining peace: let us begin with praise that is
attainable. Let us first bless God and then bless ourselves. Observe, 1.
His dependence upon God: "The Lord is my strength, to support me, and
carry me on, through all my services and sufferings. He is my shield, to
protect me from all the malicious designs of my enemies against me. I
have chosen him to be so, I have always found him so, and I expect he
will still be so." 2. His experience of the benefits of that dependence:
"My heart trusted in him, and in his power and promise; and it has not
been in vain to do so, for I am helped, I have been often helped; not
only God has given to me, in his due time, the help I trusted to him
for, but my very trusting in him has helped me, in the mean time, and
kept me from fainting." [Psa 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013.md).
The very actings of faith are present aids to a dropping spirit, and
often help it at a dead lift. 3. His improvement of this experience.
(1.) He had the pleasure of it: Therefore my heart greatly rejoices. The
joy of a believer is seated in the heart, while, in the laughter of the
fool, the heart is sorrowful. It is great joy, joy unspeakable and full
of glory. The heart that truly believes shall in due time greatly
rejoice; it is joy and peace in believing that we are to expect. (2.)
God shall have the praise of it: when my heart greatly rejoices, with my
song will I praise him. This must we express our gratitude; it is the
least we can do; and others will hereby be invited and encouraged to
trust in him too.

III\. He pleases himself with the interest which all good people,
through Christ, have in God ([Psa
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#008).md): "The Lord is their strength;
not mine only, but the strength of every believer." Note, The saints
rejoice in their friends' comforts as well as their own; for, as we have
not the less benefit from the light of the sun, so neither from the
light of Gods' countenance, for others' sharing therein; for we are sure
there is enough for all and enough for each. This is our communion with
all saints, that God is their strength and ours, Christ their Lord and
ours, [Co1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#002.md). He is their strength,
the strength of all Israel, because he is the saving strength of his
anointed, that is, 1. Of David in the type. God, in strengthening him
that was their king and fought their battles, strengthened the whole
kingdom. He calls himself God's anointed because it was the unction he
had received that exposed him to the envy of his enemies, and therefore
entitled him to the divine protection. 2. Of Christ, his anointed, his
Messiah, in the anti-type. God was his saving strength, qualified him
for his undertaking and carried him through it; see [Psa
89:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#021.md); [Isa
49:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#005.md); [Isa
50:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007.md), [Isa
50:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#009.md). And so he becomes their
strength, the strength of all the saints; he strengthened him that is
the church's head, and from him diffuses strength to all the members,
has commanded his strength, and so strengthens what he has wrought for
us; [Psa 68:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#028.md); [Psa
80:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#017.md), [Psa
80:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#018.md).

IV\. He concludes with a short but comprehensive prayer for the church
of God, [Psa 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#009.md). He prays for
Israel, not as his people ("save my people, and bless my inheritance"),
though they were so, but, "thine." God's interest in them lay nearer his
heart than his own. We are thy people is a good plea, [Isa
64:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#009.md); [Isa
63:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#019.md). I am thine, save me. God's
people are his inheritance, dear to him, and precious in his eyes; what
little glory he has from this world he has from them. The Lord's portion
is his people. That which he begs of God for them is, 1. That he would
save them from their enemies and the dangers they were exposed to. 2.
That he would bless them with all good, flowing from his favour, in
performance of his promise, and amounting to a happiness for them. 3.
That he would feed them, bless them with plenty, and especially the
plenty of his ordinances, which are food to the soul. Rule them; so the
margin. "Direct their counsels and actions aright, and overrule their
affairs for good. Feed them, and rule them; sets pastors, set rulers,
over them, that shall do their office with wisdom and understanding." 4.
That he would lift them up for ever, lift them up out of their troubles
and distresses, and do this, not only for those of that age, but for his
people in every age to come, even to the end. "Lift them up into thy
glorious kingdom, lift them up as high as heaven." There, and there
only, will the saints be lifted up for ever, never more to sink or be
depressed. Observe, Those, and those only, whom God feeds and rules, who
are willing to be taught, and guided, and governed, by him, shall be
saved, and blessed, and lifted up for ever.
