### [Isaiah Chapter 64](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 64:0</span></span>

This chapter goes on with that pathetic pleading prayer which the church
offered up to God in the latter part of the foregoing chapter. They had
argued from their covenant-relation to God and his interest and concern
in them; now here, I. They pray that God would appear in some remarkable
and surprising manner for them against his and their enemies ([Isa
64:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md), [Isa
64:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#002).md). II. They plead what God had
formerly done, and was always ready to do, for his people ([Isa
64:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#003).md). III. They confess themselves
to be sinful and unworthy of God's favour, and that they had deserved
the judgments they were now under ([Isa
64:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#006.md), [Isa
64:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#007).md). IV. They refer themselves to
the mercy of God as a Father, and submit themselves to his sovereignty
([Isa 64:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#008).md). V. They represent the
very deplorable condition they were in, and earnestly pray for the
pardon of sin and the turning away of God's anger ([Isa
64:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#009).md). And this was not only
intended for the use of the captive Jews, but may serve for direction to
the church in other times of distress, what to ask of God and how to
plead with him. Are God's people at any time in affliction, in great
affliction? Let them pray, let them thus pray.

[Isaiah 64:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 64:1</span></span>

Here, I. The petition is that God would appear wonderfully for them now,
[Isa 64:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md), [Isa
64:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#002.md). Their case was represented in
the close of the foregoing chapter as very sad and very hard, and in
this case it was time to cry, "Help, Lord; O that God would manifest his
zeal and his strength!" They had prayed ([Isa
63:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#015).md) that God would look down from
heaven; here they pray that he would come down to deliver them, as he
had said, [Exo 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008.md). 1. They desire
that God would in his providence manifest himself both to them and for
them. When God works some extraordinary deliverance for his people he is
said to shine forth, to show himself strong; so, here, they pray that he
would rend the heavens and come down, as when he delivered David he is
said to bow the heavens, and come down ([Psa
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#009).md), to display his power, and
justice, and goodness, in an extraordinary manner, so that all may take
notice of them and acknowledge them. This God's people desire and pray
for, that they themselves having the satisfaction of seeing him though
his way be in the sea, others may be made to see him when his way is in
the clouds. This is applicable to the second coming of Christ, when the
Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout. Come, Lord Jesus,
come quickly. 2. They desire that he would vanquish all opposition and
that it might be made to give way before him: That the mountains might
flow down at thy presence, that the fire of thy wrath may burn so
fiercely against thy enemies as even to dissolve the rockiest mountains
and melt them down before it, as metal in the furnace, which is made
liquid and cast into what shape the operator pleases; so the melting
fire burns, [Isa 64:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#002.md). Let things be
put into a ferment, in order to a glorious revolution in favour of the
church: As the fire causes the waters to boil. There is an allusion
here, some think, to the volcanoes, or burning mountains, which
sometimes send forth such sulphureous streams as make the adjacent
rivers and seas to boil, which, perhaps, are left as sensible
intimations of the power of God's wrath and warning - pieces of the
final conflagration. 3. They desire that this may tend very much to the
glory and honour of God, may make his name known, not only to his
friends (they knew it before, and trusted in his power), but to his
adversaries likewise, that they may know it and tremble at his presence,
and may say, with the men of Bethshemesh, Who is able to stand before
this holy Lord God? Who knows the power of his anger? Note, Sooner or
later God will make his name known to his adversaries and force those to
tremble at his presence that would not come and worship in his presence.
God's name, if it be not a stronghold for us, into which we may run and
be safe, will be a strong-hold against us, out of the reach of which we
cannot run and be safe. The day will come when nations shall be made to
tremble at the presence of God, though they be ever so numerous and
strong.

II\. The plea is that God had appeared wonderfully for his people
formerly; and thou hast, therefore thou wilt, is good arguing at the
throne of grace, [Psa 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017.md).

1\. They plead what he had done for his people Israel in particular when
he brought them out of Egypt, [Isa
64:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#003.md). He then did terrible things in
the plagues of Egypt, which they looked not for; they despaired of
deliverance, so far were they from any thought of being delivered with
such a high hand and outstretched arm. Then he came down upon Mount
Sinai in such terror as made that and the adjacent mountains to flow
down at his presence, to skip like rams ([Psa
114:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#004).md), to tremble, so that they were
scattered and the perpetual hills were made to bow, [Hab
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#006.md). In the many great salvations God
wrought for that people he did terrible things which they looked not
for, made great men, that seemed as stately and strong as mountains, to
fall before him, and great opposition to give way. See [Jdg
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#004.md), [Jdg
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#005.md); [Psa
68:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#007.md), [Psa
68:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#008.md). Some refer this to the defeat of
Sennacherib's powerful army, which was as surprising an instance of the
divine power as the melting down of rocks and mountains would be.

2\. They plead what God had been used to do, and had declared his
gracious purpose to do, for his people in general. The provision he has
made for the safety and happiness of his people, even of all those that
seek him, and serve him, and trust in him, is very rich and very ready,
so that they need not fear being either disappointed of it, for it is
sure, or disappointed in it, for it is sufficient.

(1.) It is very rich, [Isa 64:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004.md). Men
have not heard nor seen what God has prepared for those that wait for
him. Observe the character of God's people; they are such as wait for
him in the way of duty, wait for the salvation he has promised and
designed for them. Observe where the happiness of this people is bound
up; it is what God has prepared for them, what he has designed for them
in his counsel and is in his providence and grace preparing for them and
preparing them for, what he has done or will do, so it may be read. Some
of the Jewish doctors have understood this of the blessings reserved for
the days of the Messiah, and to them the apostle applies these words;
and others extend them to the glories of the world to come. It is all
that goodness which God has laid up for those that fear him, and wrought
for those that trust in him, [Psa
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#019.md). Of this it is here said that
since the beginning of the world, in the most prying and inquisitive
ages of it, men have not, either by hearing or seeing, the two learning
senses, come to the full knowledge of it. None have seen, nor heard, nor
can understand, but God himself, what the provision is that is made for
the present and future felicity of holy souls. For, \[1.\] Much of it
was concealed in former ages; they knew it not, because the unsearchable
riches of Christ were hidden in God, were hidden from the wise and
prudent; but in latter ages they were revealed by the gospel; so the
apostle applies this ([Co1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009).md), for
it follows ([Isa 64:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#010).md), But God has
revealed them unto us by his Spirit; compare [Rom
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025.md), [Rom
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#026.md), with [Eph
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009.md). That which men had not heard
since the beginning of the world they should hear before the end of it,
and at the end of it should see, when the veil shall be rent to
introduce the glory that is yet to be revealed. God himself knew what he
had in store for believers, but none knew besides him. \[2.\] It cannot
be fully comprehended by the human understanding, no, not when it is
revealed; it is spiritual, and refined from those ideas which our minds
are most apt to receive in this world of sense; it is very great, and
will far outdo the utmost of our expectations. Even the present peace of
believers, much more their future bliss, is such as surpasses all
conception and expression, [Phi 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007.md).
None can comprehend it but God himself, whose understanding is infinite.
Some give another reading of these words, referring the transcendency,
not so much to the work itself as to the author of it: Neither has the
eye seen a god besides thee, who doth so (or has done or can do so) for
him that waits for him. We must infer from God's works of wonderous
grace, as well as from his works of wondrous power, from the kind
things, as well as from the great things, he does, that there is no god
like him, nor any among the sons of the mighty to be compared with him.

(2.) It is very ready ([Isa 64:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#005).md):
"Thou meetest him that rejoices and works righteousness, meetest him
with that good which thou hast prepared for him ([Isa
64:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004).md), and dost not forget those that
remember thee in thy ways." See here what communion there is between a
gracious God and a gracious soul. \[1.\] What God expects from us, in
order to our having communion with him. First, We must make conscience
of doing our duty in every thing, we must work righteousness, must do
that which is good and which the Lord our God requires of us, and must
do it well. Secondly, We must be cheerful in doing our duty, we must
rejoice and work righteousness, must delight ourselves in God and in his
law, must be cheerful in his service and sing at our work. God loves a
cheerful giver, a cheerful worshipper. We must serve the Lord with
gladness. Thirdly, We must conform ourselves to all the methods of his
providence concerning us and be suitably affected with them, must
remember him in his ways, in all the ways wherein he walks, whether he
walks towards us or walks contrary to us. We must mind him and make
mention of him with thanksgiving when his ways are ways of mercy (in a
day of prosperity be joyful), with patience and submission when he
contends with us. In the way of thy judgments we have waited for thee;
for in a day of adversity we must consider. \[2.\] We are here told what
we may expect from God if we thus attend him in the way of duty: Thou
meetest him. This intimates the friendship, fellowship, and familiarity
to which God admits his people; he meets them, to converse with them, to
manifest himself to them, and to receive their addresses, [Exo
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#024.md); [Exo
29:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#043.md). It likewise intimates his
freeness and forwardness in doing them good; he will anticipate them
with the blessings of his goodness, will rejoice to do good to those
that rejoice in working righteousness, and wait to be gracious to those
that wait for him. He meets his penitent people with a pardon, as the
father of the prodigal met his returning son, [Luk
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#020.md). He meets his praying people
with an answer of peace, while they are yet speaking, [Isa
65:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#024.md).

3\. They plead the unchangeableness of God's favour and the stability of
his promise, notwithstanding the sins of his people and his displeasure
against them for their sins: "Behold, thou hast many a time been wroth
with us because we have sinned, and we have been under the tokens of thy
wrath; but in those, those ways of thine, the ways of mercy in which we
have remembered thee, in those is continuance," or "in those thou art
ever" (his mercy endures for ever), "and therefore we shall at last be
saved, though thou art wroth, and we have sinned." This agrees with the
tenour of God's covenant, that, if we forsake the law, he will visit our
transgression with a rod, but his lovingkindness he will not utterly
take away, his covenant he will not break ([Psa
89:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#030), etc..md), and by this his people
have been many a time saved from ruin when they were just upon the brink
of it; see [Psa 78:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#038.md). And by this
continuance of the covenant we hope to be saved, for its being an
everlasting covenant is all our salvation. Though God has been angry
with us for our sins, and justly, yet his anger has endured but for a
moment and has been soon over; but in his favour is life, because in it
is continuance; in the ways of his favour he proceeds and perseveres,
and on that we depend for our salvation, see [Isa
54:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#007.md), [Isa
54:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#008.md). It is well for us that our hopes
of salvation are built not upon any merit or sufficiency of our own (for
in that there is no certainty, even Adam in innocency did not abide),
but upon God's mercies and promises, for in those, we are sure, is
continuance.

[Isaiah 64:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 64:6</span></span>

As we have the Lamentations of Jeremiah, so here we have the
Lamentations of Isaiah; the subject of both is the same - the
destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans and the sin of Israel that
brought that destruction - only with this difference, Isaiah sees it at
a distance and laments it by the Spirit of prophecy, Jeremiah saw it
accomplished. In these verses,

I. The people of God in their affliction confess and bewail their sins,
thereby justifying God in their afflictions, owning themselves unworthy
of his mercy, and thereby both improving their troubles and preparing
for deliverance. Now that they were under divine rebukes for sin they
had nothing to trust to but the mere mercy of God and the continuance of
that; for among themselves there is none to help, none to uphold, none
to stand in the gap and make intercession, for they are all polluted
with sin and therefore unworthy to intercede, all careless and remiss in
duty and therefore unable and unfit to intercede.

1\. There was a general corruption of manners among them ([Isa
64:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#006).md): We are all as an unclean thing,
or as an unclean person, as one overspread with a leprosy, who was to be
shut out of the camp. The body of the people were like one under a
ceremonial pollution, who was not admitted into the courts of the
tabernacle, or like one labouring under some loathsome disease, from the
crown of the head to the sole of the foot nothing but wounds and
bruises, [Isa 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006.md). We have all by sin
become not only obnoxious to God's justice, but odious to his holiness;
for sin is that abominable thing which the Lord hates, and cannot endure
to look upon. Even all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags. (1.) "The
best of our persons are so; we are all so corrupt and polluted that even
those among us who pass for righteous men, in comparison with what our
fathers were who rejoiced and wrought righteousness ([Isa
64:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#005).md), are but as filthy rags, fit to
be case to the dunghill. The best of them is as a brier." (2.) "The best
of our performances are so. There is not only a general corruption of
manners, but a general defection in the exercises of devotion too; those
which pass for the sacrifices of righteousness, when they come to be
enquired into, are the torn, and the lame, and the sick, and therefore
are provoking to God, as nauseous as filthy rags." Our performances,
though they be ever so plausible, if we depend upon them as our
righteousness and think to merit by them at God's hand, are as filthy
rags - rags, and will not cover us - filthy rags, and will but defile
us. True penitents cast away their idols as filthy rags ([Isa
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#022).md), odious in their sight; here
they acknowledge even their righteousness to be so in God's sight if he
should deal with them in strict justice. Our best duties are so
defective, and so far short of the rule, that they are as rags, and so
full of sin and corruption cleaving to them that they are as filthy
rags. When we would do good evil is present with us; and the iniquity of
our holy things would be our ruin if we were under the law.

2\. There was a general coldness of devotion among them, [Isa
64:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#007.md). The measure was filled by the
abounding iniquity of the people, and nothing was done to empty it. (1.)
Prayer was in a manner neglected: "There is none that calls on thy name,
none that seeks to thee for grace to reform us and take away sin, or for
mercy to relieve us and take away the judgments which our sins have
brought upon us." Therefore people are so bad, because they do not pray;
compare [Psa 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#003.md), [Psa
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#004.md), They have altogether become
filthy, for they call not upon the Lord. It bodes ill to a people when
prayer is restrained among them. (2.) It was very negligently performed.
If there was here and there one that called on God's name, it was with a
great deal of indifferency: There is none that stirs up himself to take
hold of God. Note, \[1.\] To pray is to take hold of God, by faith to
take hold of the promises and the declarations God has made of his
good-will to us and to plead them with him, - to take hold of him as of
one who is about to depart from us, earnestly begging of him not to
leave us, or of one that has departed, soliciting his return, - to take
hold of him as he that wrestles takes hold of him he wrestles with; for
the seed of Jacob wrestle with him and so prevail. But when we take hold
of God it is as the boatman with his hook takes hold on the shore, as if
he would pull the shore to him, but really it is to pull himself to the
shore; so we pray, not to bring God to our mind, but to bring ourselves
to him. \[2.\] Those that would take hold of God in prayer so as to
prevail with him must stir up themselves to do it; all that is within us
must be employed in the duty (and all little enough), our thoughts fixed
and our affections flaming. In order hereunto all that is within us must
be engaged and summoned into the service; we must stir up the gift that
is in us by an actual consideration of the importance of the work that
is before us and a close application of mind to it; but how can we
expect that God should come to us in ways of mercy when there are none
that do this, when those that profess to be intercessors are mere
triflers?

II\. They acknowledge their afflictions to be the fruit and product of
their own sins and God's wrath. 1. They brought their troubles upon
themselves by their own folly: "We are all as an unclean thing, and
therefore we do all fade away as a leaf ([Isa
64:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#006).md), we not only wither and lose our
beauty, but we fall and drop off" (so the word signifies) "as leaves in
autumn; our profession of religion withers, and we grow dry and sapless;
our prosperity withers and comes to nothing; we fall to the ground, as
despicable and contemptible; and then our iniquities like the wind have
taken us away and hurried us into captivity, as the winds in autumn blow
off, and then blow away, the faded withered leaves," [Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md), [Psa
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004.md). Sinners are blasted, and then
carried away, by the malignant and violent wind of their own iniquity;
it withers them and then ruins them. 2. God brought their troubles upon
them by his wrath ([Isa 64:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#007).md): Thou
hast hidden thy face from us; hast been displeased with us and refused
to afford us any succour. When they made themselves as an unclean thing
no wonder that God turned his face away from them, as loathing them. Yet
this was not all: Thou hast consumed us because of our iniquities. This
is the same complaint with that ([Psa
90:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#007.md), [Psa
90:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#008).md), We are consumed by thy anger;
thou hast melted us, so the word is. God had put them in the furnace,
not to consume them as dross, but to melt them as gold, that they might
be refined and new-cast.

III\. They claim relation to God as their God, and humbly plead it with
him, and in consideration of it cheerfully refer themselves to him ([Isa
64:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#008).md): "But now, O Lord! thou art our
Father: though we have conducted ourselves very undutifully and
ungratefully towards thee, yet still we have owned thee as our Father;
and, though thou hast corrected us, yet thou hast not cast us off.
Foolish and careless as we are, poor and despised and trampled upon as
we are by our enemies, yet still thou art our Father; to thee therefore
we return in our repentance, as the prodigal arose and came to his
father; to thee we address ourselves by prayer; from whom should we
expect relief and succour but from our Father? It is the wrath of a
Father that we are under, who will be reconciled and not keep his anger
for ever." God is their Father, 1. By creation; he gave them their
being, formed them into a people, shaped them as he pleased: "We are the
clay and thou our potter, therefore we will not quarrel with thee,
however thou art pleased to deal with us, [Jer
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#006.md). Nay, therefore we will hope that
thou wilt deal well with us, that thou who madest us wilt new-make us,
new-form us, though we have unmade and deformed ourselves: We are all as
an unclean thing, but we are all the work of thy hands, therefore do
away our uncleanness, that we may be fit for thy use, the use we were
made for. We are the work of thy hands, therefore forsake us not," [Psa
138:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#008.md). 2. By covenant; this is pleaded
([Isa 64:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#009).md): "Behold, see, we beseech
thee, we are all thy people, all the people thou hast in the world, that
make open profession of thy name. We are called thy people, our
neighbours look upon us as such, and therefore what we suffer reflects
upon thee, and the relief that our case requires is expected from thee.
We are thy people; and should not a people seek unto their God? [Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019.md). We are thine; save us," [Psa
119:94](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#094.md). Note, When we are under
providential rebukes from God it is good to keep fast hold of our
covenant-relation to him.

IV\. They are importunate with God for the turning away of his anger and
the pardoning of their sins ([Isa
64:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#009).md): "Be not wroth very sore, O
Lord! though we have deserved that thou shouldst, neither remember
iniquity for ever against us." They do not expressly pray for the
removal of the judgment they were under; as to that, they refer
themselves to God. But, 1. They pray that God would be reconciled to
them, and then they can be easy whether the affliction be continued or
removed: "Be not wroth to extremity, but let thy anger be mitigated by
the clemency and compassion of a father." They do not say, Lord, rebuke
us not, for that may be necessary, but Not in thy anger, not in thy hot
displeasure. It is but in a little wrath that God hides his face. 2.
They pray that they may not be dealt with according to the desert of
their sin: Neither remember iniquity for ever. Such is the evil of sin
that it deserves to be remembered for ever; and this is that which they
deprecate, that consequence of sin, which is for ever. Those make it to
appear that they are truly humbled under the hand of God who are more
afraid of the terror of God's wrath, and the fatal consequences of their
own sin, than of any judgment whatsoever, looking upon these as the
sting of death.

V. They lodge in the court of heaven a very melancholy representation,
or memorial, of the lamentable condition they were in and the ruins they
were groaning under. 1. Their own houses were in ruins, [Isa
64:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#010.md). The cities of Judah were
destroyed by the Chaldeans and the inhabitants of them were carried
away, so that there was none to repair them or take any notice of them,
which would in a few years make them look like perfect deserts: Thy holy
cities are a wilderness. The cities of Judah are called holy cities, for
the people were unto God a kingdom of priests. The cities had synagogues
in them, in which God was served; and therefore they lamented the ruins
of them, and insisted upon this in pleading with God for them, not so
much that they were stately cities, rich or ancient ones, but that they
were holy cities, cities in which God's name was known, professed, and
called upon. "These cities are a wilderness; the beauty of them is
sullied; they are neither inhabited nor visited, as formerly. They have
burnt up all the synagogues of God in the land," [Psa
74:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#008.md). Nor was it only the smaller
cities that were thus left as a wilderness unfrequented, but even "Zion
is a wilderness; the city of David itself lies in ruins; Jerusalem, that
was beautiful for situation and the joy of the whole earth, is now
deformed, and has become the scorn and scandal of the whole earth; that
noble city is a desolation, a heap of rubbish." See what devastations
sin brings upon a people; and an external profession of sanctity will be
no fence against them; holy cities, if they become wicked cities, will
be soonest of all turned into a wilderness, [Amo
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#002.md). 2. God's house was in ruins, [Isa
64:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#011.md). This they lament most of all,
that the temple was burnt with fire; but, as soon as it was built, they
were told what their sin would bring it to. [Ch2
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#021.md), This house, which is high, shall
be an astonishment. Observe how pathetically they bewail the ruins of
the temple. (1.) It was their holy and beautiful house; it was a most
sumptuous building, but the holiness of it was in their eye the greatest
beauty of it, and consequently the profanation of it was the saddest
part of its desolation and that which grieved them most, that the sacred
services which used to be performed there were discontinued. (2.) It was
the place where their fathers praised God with their sacrifices and
songs; what a pity is it that that should lie in ashes which had been
for so many ages the glory of their nation! It aggravated their present
disuse of the songs of Zion that their fathers had so often praised God
with them. They interest God in the cause when they plead that it was
the house where he had been praised, and put him in mind too of his
covenant with their fathers by taking notice of their fathers' praising
him. (3.) With it all their pleasant things were laid waste, all their
desires and delights, all those things which were employed by them in
the service of God, which they had a great delight in; not only the
furniture of the temple, the altars and table, but especially the
sabbaths and new moons, and all their religious feasts, which they used
to keep with gladness, their ministers and solemn assemblies, these were
all a desolation. Note, God's people reckon their sacred things their
most delectable things; rob them of holy ordinances and the means of
grace, and you lay waste all their pleasant things. What have they more?
Observe here how God and his people have their interest twisted and
interchanged; when they speak of the cities for their own habitation
they call them thy holy cities, for to God they were dedicated; when
they speak of the temple wherein God dwelt they call it our beautiful
house and its furniture our pleasant things, for they had heartily
espoused it and all the interests of it. If thus we interest God in all
our concerns by devoting them to his service, and interest ourselves in
all his concerns by laying them near our hearts, we may with
satisfaction leave both with him, for he will perfect both.

VI\. They conclude with an affectionate expostulation, humbly arguing
with God concerning their present desolations ([Isa
64:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#012).md): "Wilt thou refrain thyself for
these things? Or, Canst thou contain thyself at these things? Canst thou
see thy temple ruined and not resent it, not revenge it? Has the jealous
God forgotten to be jealous? [Psa
74:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#022.md), Arise, O God! plead thy own
cause. Lord, thou art insulted, thou art blasphemed; and wilt thou hold
thy peace and take no notice of it? Shall the highest affronts that can
be done to Heaven pass unrebuked?" When we are abused we hold our peace,
because vengeance does not belong to us, and because we have a God to
refer our cause to. When God is injured in his honour it may justly be
expected that he should speak in the vindication of it; his people
prescribe not to him what he shall say, but their prayer is (as here)
[Psa 83:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#001.md), Keep not thou silence, O
God! and [Psa 109:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#001.md), "Hold not thy
peace, O God of my praise! Speak for the conviction of thy enemies,
speak for the comfort and relief of thy people; for wilt thou afflict us
very grievously, or afflict us for ever?" It is a sore affliction to
good people to see God's sanctuary laid waste and nothing done towards
the raising of it out of its ruins. But God has said that he will not
contend for ever, and therefore his people may depend upon it that their
afflictions shall be neither to extremity nor to eternity, but light and
for a moment.
