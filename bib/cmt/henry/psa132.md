### [Psalms Chapter 132](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 132:0</span></span>

It is probable that this psalm was penned by Solomon, to be sung at the
dedication of the temple which he built according to the charge his
father gave him, [Ch1 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002.md), etc.
Having fulfilled his trust, he begs of God to own what he had done. I.
He had built this house for the honour and service of God; and when he
brings the ark into it, the token of God's presence, he desires that God
himself would come and take possession of it ([Psa
132:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#008).md). With these words Solomon
concluded his prayer, [Ch2 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#041.md), [Ch2
6:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#042.md). II. He had built it in pursuance
of the orders he had received from his father, and therefore his pleas
to enforce these petitions refer to David. 1. He pleads David's piety
towards God ([Psa 132:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#001).md). 2. He
pleads God's promise to David ([Psa
132:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#011).md). The former introduces his
petition: the latter follows it as an answer to it. In singing this
psalm we must have a concern for the gospel church as the temple of God,
and a dependence upon Christ as David our King, in whom the mercies of
God are sure mercies.

A song of degrees.

[Psalms 132:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 132:1</span></span>

In these verses we have Solomon's address to God for his favour to him
and to his government, and his acceptance of his building a house to
God's name. Observe,

I. What he pleads - two things: -

1\. That what he had done was in pursuance of the pious vow which his
father David had made to build a house for God. Solomon was a wise man,
yet pleads not any merit of his own: "I am not worthy, for whom thou
shouldst do this; but, Lord, remember David, with whom thou madest the
covenant" (as Moses prayed, [Exo
32:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#013.md), Remember Abraham, the first
trustee of the covenant); "remember all his afflictions, all the
troubles of his life, which his being anointed was the occasion of," or
his care and concern about the ark, and what an uneasiness it was to him
that the ark was in curtains, [Sa2
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#002.md). Remember all his humility and
meekness (so some read it), all that pious and devout affection with
which he had made the following vow. Note, It is not amiss for us to put
God in mind of our predecessors in profession, of their afflictions,
their services, and their sufferings, of God's covenant with them, the
experiences they have had of his goodness, the care they took of, and
the many prayers they put up for, those that should come after them. We
may apply it to Christ, the Son of David, and to all his afflictions:
"Lord, remember the covenant made with him and the satisfaction made by
him. Remember all his offerings ([Psa
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#003).md), that is, all his sufferings."
He especially pleads the solemn vow that David had made as soon as ever
he was settled in his government, and before he was well settled in a
house of his own, that he would build a house for God. Observe, (1.)
Whom he bound himself to, to the Lord, to the mighty God of Jacob. Vows
are to be made to God, who is a party as well as a witness. The Lord is
the Mighty One of Jacob, Jacob's God, and a mighty one, whose power is
engaged for Jacob's defence and deliverance. Jacob is weak, but the God
of Jacob is a mighty one. (2.) What he bound himself to do, to find out
a place for the Lord, that is, for the ark, the token of his presence.
He had observed in the law frequent mention of the place that God would
choose to put his name there, to which all the tribes should resort.
When he came to the crown there was no such place; Shiloh was deserted,
and no other place was pitched upon, for want of which the feasts of the
Lord were not kept with due solemnity. "Well," says David, "I will find
out such a place for the general rendezvous of all the tribes, a place
of habitation for the Mighty One of Jacob, a place for the ark, where
there shall be room both for the priests and people to attend upon it."
(3.) How intent he was upon it; he would not settle in his bed, till he
had brought this matter to some head, [Psa
132:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#003.md), [Psa
132:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#004.md). The thing had been long talked
of, and nothing done, till at last David, when he went out one morning
about public business, made a vow that before night he would come to a
resolution in this matter, and would determine the place either where
the tent should be pitched for the reception of the ark, at the
beginning of his reign, or rather where Solomon should build the temple,
which was not fixed till the latter end of his reign, just after the
pestilence with which he was punished for numbering the people ([Ch1
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#001.md), Then David said, This is the
house of the Lord); and perhaps it was upon occasion of that judgment
that he made this vow, being apprehensive that one of God's
controversies with him was for his dilatoriness in this matter. Note,
When needful work is to be done for God it is good for us to task
ourselves, and tie ourselves to a time, because we are apt to put off.
It is good in the morning to cut out work for the day, binding ourselves
that we will do it before we sleep, only with submission to Providence;
for we know not what a day may bring forth. Especially in the great work
of conversion to God we must be thus solicitous, thus zealous; we have
good reason to resolve that we will not enjoy the comforts of this life
till we have laid a foundation for hopes of a better.

2\. That it was in pursuance of the expectations of the people of
Israel, [Psa 132:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#006.md), [Psa
132:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#007). (1..md) They were inquisitive
after the ark; for they lamented its obscurity, [Sa1
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#002.md). They heard of it at Ephratah
(that is, at Shiloh, in the tribe of Ephraim); there they were told it
had been, but it was gone. They found it, at last, in the fields of the
wood, that is, in Kirjath-jearim, which signifies the city of woods.
Thence all Israel fetched it, with great solemnity, in the beginning of
David's reign ([Ch1 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#006).md), so that in
building his house for the ark Solomon had gratified all Israel. They
needed not to go about to seek the ark anymore; they now knew where to
find it. (2.) They were resolved to attend it: "Let us but have a
convenient place, and we will go into his tabernacle, to pay our homage
there; we will worship at his footstool as subjects and suppliants,
which we neglected to do, for want of such a place, in the days of
Saul," [Ch1 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#003.md).

II\. What he prays for, [Psa 132:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#008.md).
1. That God would vouchsafe, not only to take possession of, but to take
up his residence in, this temple which he had built: Arise, O Lord! into
thy rest, and let this be it, thou, even the ark of thy strength, the
pledge of thy presence, thy mighty presence. 2. That God would give
grace to the ministers of the sanctuary to do their duty: Let thy
priests be clothed with righteousness; let them appear righteous both in
their administrations and in their conversations, and let both be
according to the rule. Note, Righteousness is the best ornament of a
minister. Holiness towards God, and goodness towards all men, are habits
for ministers of the necessity of which there is no dispute. "They are
thy priests, and will therefore discredit their relation to thee if they
be not clothed with righteousness." 3. That the people of God might have
the comfort of the due administration of holy ordinances among them: Let
thy saints shout for joy. They did so when the ark was brought into the
city of David ([Sa2 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#015).md); they will
do so when the priests are clothed with righteousness. A faithful
ministry is the joy of the saints; it is the matter of it; it is a
friend and a furtherance to it; we are helpers of your joy, [Co2
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#024.md). 4. That Solomon's own prayer,
upon occasion of the dedicating of the temple, might be accepted of God:
"Turn not away the face of thy anointed, that is, deny me not the things
I have asked of thee, send me not away ashamed." He pleads, (1.) That he
was the anointed of the Lord, and this he pleads as a type of Christ,
the great anointed, who, in his intercession, urges his designation to
his office. He is God's anointed, and therefore the Father hears him
always. (2.) That he was the son of David: "For his sake do not deny
me;" and this is the Christian's plea: "For the sake of Christ" (our
David), "in whom thou art well pleased, accept me." He is David, whose
name signifies beloved; and we are made accepted in the beloved. He is
God's servant, whom he upholds, [Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md). "We have no merit of our own to
plead, but for his sake, in whom there is a fulness of merit, let us
find favour." When we pray for the prosperity of the church we may pray
with great boldness, for Christ's sake, who purchased the church with
his own blood. "Let both ministers and people do their duty."

[Psalms 132:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 132:11</span></span>

These are precious promises, confirmed by an oath, that the heirs of
them might have strong consolation, [Heb
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#017.md), [Heb
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018.md). It is all one whether we take
them as pleas urged in the prayer or as answers returned to the prayer;
believers know how to make use of the promises both ways, with them to
speak to God and in them to hear what God the Lord will speak to us.
These promises relate to the establishment both in church and state,
both to the throne of the house of David and to the testimony of Israel
fixed on Mount Zion. The promises concerning Zion's hill are as
applicable to the gospel-church as these concerning David's seed are to
Christ, and therefore both pleadable by us and very comfortable to us.
Here is,

I. The choice God made of David's house and Zion hill. Both were of
divine appointment.

1\. God chose David's family for the royal family and confirmed his
choice by an oath, [Psa 132:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#011.md), [Psa
132:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#012.md). David, being a type of Christ,
was made king with an oath: The Lord hath sworn and will not repent,
will not turn from it. Did David swear to the Lord ([Psa
132:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#002).md) that he would find him a house?
The Lord swore to David that he would build him a house; for God will be
behind with none of his people in affections or assurances. The promise
made to David refers, (1.) To a long succession of kings that should
descend from his loins: Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy
throne, which was fulfilled in Solomon; David himself lived to see it
with great satisfaction, [Kg1 1:48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#048.md).
The crown was also entailed conditionally upon his heirs for ever: If
thy children, in following ages, will keep my covenant and my testimony
that I shall teach them. God himself engaged to teach them, and he did
his part; they had Moses and the prophets, and all he expects is that
they should keep what he taught them, and keep to it, and then their
children shall sit upon thy throne for evermore. Kings are before God
upon their good behaviour, and their commission from him runs quamdiu se
bene gesserint - during good behaviour. The issue of this was that they
did not keep God's covenant, and so the entail was at length cut off,
and the sceptre departed from Judah by degrees. (2.) To an everlasting
successor, a king that should descend from his loins of the increase of
whose government and peace there shall be no end. St. Peter applies this
to Christ, nay, he tells us that David himself so understood it. [Act
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#030.md), He knew that God had sworn with
an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh,
he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; and in the fulness of
time he did so, and gave him the throne of his father David, [Luk
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032.md). He did fulfill the condition of
the promise; he kept God's covenant and his testimony, did his Father's
will, and in all things pleased him; and therefore to him, and his
spiritual seed, the promise shall be made good. He, and the children God
has given him, all believers, shall sit upon the throne for evermore,
[Rev 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021.md).

2\. God chose Zion hill for the holy hill, and confirmed his choice by
the delight he took in it, [Psa
132:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#013.md), [Psa
132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014.md). He chose the Mount Zion which
he loved ([Psa 78:68](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#068).md); he chose it for
the habitation of his ark, and said of it, This is my rest for ever, and
not merely my residence for a time, as Shiloh was. Zion was the city of
David; he chose it for the royal city because God chose it for the holy
city. God said, Here will I dwell, and therefore David said, Here will I
dwell, for here he adhered to his principle, It is good for me to be
near to God. Zion must be here looked upon as a type of the
gospel-church, which is called Mount Zion ([Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022).md), and in it what is here said of
Zion has its full accomplishment. Zion was long since ploughed as a
field, but the church of Christ is the house of the living God ([Ti1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015).md), and it is his rest for ever,
and shall be blessed with his presence always, even to the end of the
world. The delight God takes in his church, and the continuance of his
presence with his church, are the comfort and joy of all its members.

II\. The choice blessings God has in store for David's house and Zion
hill. Whom God chooses he will bless.

1\. God, having chosen Zion hill, promises to bless that,

(1.) With the blessings of the life that now is; for godliness has the
promise of them, [Psa 132:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#015.md). The
earth shall yield her increase; where religion is set up there shall be
provision, and in blessing God will bless it ([Psa
67:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#006).md); he will surely and abundantly
bless it. And a little provision, with an abundant blessing upon it,
will be more serviceable, as well as more comfortable, than a great deal
without that blessing. God's people have a special blessing upon common
enjoyments, and that blessing puts a peculiar sweetness into them. Nay,
the promise goes further: I will satisfy her poor with bread. Zion has
her own poor to keep; and it is promised that God will take care even of
them. \[1.\] By his providence they shall be kept from wanting; they
shall have provision enough. If there be scarcity, the poor are the
first that feel it, so that it is a sure sign of plenty if they have
sufficient. Zion's poor shall not want, for God has obliged all the sons
of Zion to be charitable to the poor, according to their ability, and
the church must take care that they be not neglected, [Act
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md). \[2.\] By his grace they shall be
kept from complaining; though they have but dry bread, yet they shall be
satisfied. Zion's poor have, of all others, reason to be content with a
little of this world, because they have better things prepared for them.
And this may be understood spiritually of the provision that is made for
the soul in the word and ordinances; God will abundantly bless that for
the nourishment of the new man, and satisfy the poor in spirit with the
bread of life. What God sanctifies to us we shall and may be satisfied
with.

(2.) With the blessings of the life that is to come, things pertaining
to godliness ([Psa 132:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#016).md), which is
an answer to the prayer, [Psa 132:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#009.md).
\[1.\] It was desired that the priests might be clothed with
righteousness; it is here promised that God will clothe them with
salvation, not only save them, but make them and their administrations
instrumental for the salvation of his people; they shall both save
themselves and those that hear them, and add those to the church that
shall be saved. Note, Whom God clothes with righteousness he will clothe
with salvation; we must pray for righteousness and then with it God will
give salvation. \[2.\] It was desired that the saints might shout for
joy; it is promised that they shall shout aloud for joy. God gives more
than we ask, and when he gives salvation he will give an abundant joy.

2\. God, having chosen David's family, here promises to bless that also
with suitable blessings. (1.) Growing power: There, in Zion, will I make
the horn of David to bud, [Psa 132:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#017.md).
The royal dignity shall increase more and more, and constant additions
he made to the lustre of it. Christ is the horn of salvation (denoting a
plentiful and powerful salvation) which God has raised up, and made to
bud, in the house of his servant David. David had promised to use his
power for God's glory, to cut off the horns of the wicked, and to exalt
the horns of the righteous ([Psa
75:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#010).md); in recompence for it God here
promises to make his horn to bud, for to those that have power, and use
it well, more shall be given. (2.) Lasting honour: I have ordained a
lamp for my anointed. Thou wilt light my candle, [Psa
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#028.md). That lamp is likely to burn
brightly which God ordains. A lamp is a successor, for, when a lamp is
almost out, another may be lighted by it; it is a succession, for by
this means David shall not want a man to stand before God. Christ is the
lamp and the light of the world. (3.) Complete victory: "His enemies,
who have formed designs against him, will I clothe with shame, when they
shall see their designs baffled." Let the enemies of all good governors
expect to be clothed with shame, and especially the enemies of the Lord
Jesus and his government, who shall rise, in the great day, to
everlasting shame and contempt. (4.) Universal prosperity: Upon himself
shall his crown flourish, that is, his government shall be more and more
his honour. This was to have its full accomplishment in Jesus Christ,
whose crown of honour and power shall never fade, nor the flowers of it
wither. The crowns of earthly princes endure not to all generations
([Pro 27:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#024).md), but Christ's crown shall
endure to all eternity and the crowns reserved for his faithful subjects
are such as fade not away.
