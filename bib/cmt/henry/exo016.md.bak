### [Exodus Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 16:0</span></span>

This chapter gives us an account of the victualling of the camp of
Israel. I. Their complaint for want of bread ([Exo
16:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#001).md). II. The notice God gave them
beforehand of the provision he intended to make for them ([Exo
16:4-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#004).md). III. The sending of the
manna ([Exo 16:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#013).md). IV. The laws
and orders concerning the manna. 1. That they should gather it daily for
their daily bread ([Exo 16:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#016).md). 2.
That they should gather a double portion on the sixth day ([Exo
16:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#022).md). 3. That they should expect
none on the seventh day ([Exo
16:27-31](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#027).md). 4. That they should
preserve a pot of it for a memorial ([Exo
16:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#032), etc..md).

[Exodus 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 16:1</span></span>

The host of Israel, it seems, took along with them out of Egypt, when
they came thence on the fifteenth day of the first month, a month's
provisions, which, by the fifteenth day of the second month, was all
spent; and here we have,

I. Their discontent and murmuring upon that occasion, [Exo
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#002.md), [Exo
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#003.md). The whole congregation, the
greatest part of them, joined in this mutiny; it was not immediately
against God that they murmured, but (which was equivalent) against Moses
and Aaron, God's viceregents among them. 1. They count upon being killed
in the wilderness - nothing less, at the first appearance of disaster.
If the Lord had been pleased to kill them, he could easily have done
that in the Red Sea; but then he preserved them, and now could as easily
provide for them. It argues great distrust of God, and of his power and
goodness, in every distress and appearance of danger to despair of life,
and to talk of nothing but being speedily killed. 2. They invidiously
charge Moses with a design to starve them when he brought them out of
Egypt; whereas what he had done was both by order from God and with a
design to promote their welfare. Note, It is no new thing for the
greatest kindnesses to be misinterpreted and basely represented as the
greatest injuries. The worst colours are sometimes put upon the best
actions. Nay, 3. They so far undervalue their deliverance that they wish
they had died in Egypt, nay, and died by the hand of the Lord too, that
is, by some of the plagues which cut off the Egyptians, as if it were
not the hand of the Lord, but of Moses only, that brought them into this
hungry wilderness. It is common for people to say of that pain, or
sickness, or sore, of which they see not the second causes, "It is what
pleases God," as if that were not so likewise which comes by the hand of
man, or some visible accident. Prodigious madness! They would rather die
by the fleshpots of Egypt, where they found themselves with provision,
than live under the guidance of the heavenly pillar in a wilderness and
be provided for by the hand of God! they pronounce it better to have
fallen in the destruction of God's enemies than to bear the fatherly
discipline of his children! We cannot suppose that they had any great
plenty in Egypt, how largely soever they now talk of the flesh-pots; nor
could they fear dying for want in the wilderness, while they had their
flocks and herds with them. But discontent magnifies what is past, and
vilifies what is present, without regard to truth or reason. None talk
more absurdly than murmurers. Their impatience, ingratitude, and
distrust of God, were so much the worse in that they had lately received
such miraculous favours, and convincing proofs both that God could help
them in the greatest exigencies and that really he had mercy in store
for them. See how soon they forgot his works, and provoked him at the
sea, even at the Red Sea, [Psa
106:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#007.md). Note, Experiences of God's
mercies greatly aggravate our distrusts and murmurings.

II\. The care God graciously took for their supply. Justly he might have
said, "I will rain fire and brimstone upon these murmurers, and consume
them;" but, quite contrary, he promises to rain bread upon them.
Observe,

1\. How God makes known to Moses his kind intentions, that he might not
be uneasy at their murmurings, nor be tempted to wish he had let them
alone in Egypt. (1.) He takes notice of the people's complaints: I have
heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, [Exo
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#012.md). As a God of pity, he took
cognizance of their necessity, which was the occasion of their
murmuring; as a just and holy God, he took cognizance of their base and
unworthy reflections upon his servant Moses, and was much displeased
with them. Note, When we begin to fret and be uneasy, we ought to
consider that God hears all our murmurings, though silent, and only the
murmurings of the heart. Princes, parents, masters, do not hear all the
murmurs of their inferiors against them, and it is well they do not, for
perhaps they could not bear it; but God hears, and yet bears. We must
not think, because God does not immediately take vengeance on men for
their sins, that therefore he does not take notice of them; no, he hears
the murmurings of Israel, and is grieved with this generation, and yet
continues his care of them, as the tender parent of the froward child.
(2.) He promises them a speedy, sufficient, and constant supply, [Exo
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#004.md). Man being made out of the earth,
his Maker has wisely ordered him food out of the earth, [Psa
104:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#014.md). But the people of Israel,
typifying the church of the first-born that are written in heaven, and
born from above, and being themselves immediately under the direction
and government of heaven, receiving their charters, laws, and
commissions, from heaven, from heaven also received their food: their
law being given by the disposition of angels, they did also eat angels'
food. See what God designed in making this provision for them: That I
may prove them, whether they will walk in my law or no. \[1.\] Thus he
tried whether they would trust him, and walk in the law of faith or no,
whether they could live from hand to mouth, and (though now uneasy
because their provisions were spent) could rest satisfied with the bread
of the day in its day, and depend upon God for fresh supplies tomorrow.
\[2.\] Thus he tried whether they would serve him, and be always
faithful to so good a Master, that provided so well for his servants;
and hereby he made it appear to all the world, in the issue, what an
ungrateful people they were, whom nothing could affect with a sense of
obligation. Let favour be shown to them, yet will they not learn
righteousness, [Isa 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#010.md).

2\. How Moses made known these intentions to Israel, as God ordered him.
Here Aaron was his prophet, as he had been to Pharaoh. Moses directed
Aaron what to speak to the congregation of Israel ([Exo
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#009).md); and some think that, while
Aaron was giving a public summons to the congregation to come near
before the Lord, Moses retired to pray, and that the appearance of the
glory of the Lord ([Exo 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#010).md) was in
answer to his prayer. They are called to come near, as [Isa
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018.md), Come, and let us reason
together. Note, God condescends to give even murmurers a fair hearing;
and shall we then despise the cause of our inferiors when they contend
with us? [Job 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#013). (1..md) He convinces
them of the evil of their murmurings. They thought they reflected only
upon Moses and Aaron, but here they are told that God was struck at
through their sides. This is much insisted on ([Exo
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#007.md), [Exo
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#008).md): "Your murmurings are not
against us, then we would have been silent, but against the Lord; it was
he that led you into these straits, and not we." Note, When we murmur
against those who are instruments of any uneasiness to us, whether
justly or unjustly, we should do well to consider how much we reflect
upon God by it; men are but God's hand. Those that quarrel with the
reproofs and convictions of the word, and are angry with their ministers
when they are touched in a tender part, know not what they do, for
therein they strive with their Maker. Let this for ever stop the mouth
of murmuring, that it is daring impiety to murmur at God, because he is
God; and gross absurdity to murmur at men, because they are but men.
(2.) He assures them of the supply of their wants, that since they had
harped upon the flesh-pots so much they should for once have flesh in
abundance that evening, and bread the next morning, and so on every day
thenceforward, [Exo 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#008.md), [Exo
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#012.md). Many there are of whom we say
that they are better fed than taught; but the Israelites were thus fed,
that they might be taught. He led him about, he instructed him ([Deu
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#010).md); and, as to this instance, see
[Deu 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003.md), He fed thee with manna, that
thou mightest know that man doth not live by bread only. And, besides
this, here are two things mentioned, which he intended to teach them by
sending them manna: - \[1.\] By this you shall know that the Lord hath
brought you out from the land of Egypt, [Exo
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#006.md). That they were brought out of
Egypt was plain enough; but so strangely sottish and short-sighted were
they that they said it was Moses that brought them out, [Exo
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#003.md). Now God sent them manna, to
prove that it was no less than infinite power and goodness that brought
them out, and this could perfect what was begun. If Moses only had
brought them out of Egypt, he could not thus have fed them; they must
therefore own that that was the Lord's doing, because this was so, and
both were marvellous in their eyes; yet, long afterwards, they needed to
be told that Moses gave them not this bread from heaven, [Joh
6:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#032.md). \[2.\] By this you shall know
that I am the Lord your God, [Exo
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#012.md). This gave proof of his power as
the Lord, and his particular favour to them as their God. When God
plagued the Egyptians, it was to make them know that he was the Lord;
when he provided for the Israelites, it was to make them know that he
was their God.

3\. How God himself manifested his glory, to still the murmurings of the
people, and to put a reputation upon Moses and Aaron, [Exo
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#010.md). While Aaron was speaking, the
glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud. The cloud itself, one would
think, was enough both to strike an awe upon them and to give
encouragement to them; yet, in a few days, it had grown so familiar to
them that it made no impression upon them, unless it shone with an
unusual brightness. Note, What God's ministers say to us is then likely
to do us good when the glory of God shines in with it upon our souls.

[Exodus 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 16:13</span></span>

Now they begin to be provided for by the immediate hand of God.

I. He makes them a feast, at night, of delicate fowl, feathered fowl
([Psa 78:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#027).md), therefore not locusts,
as some think; quails, or pheasants, or some wild fowl, came up, and
covered the camp, so tame that they might take up as many of them as
they pleased. Note, God gives us of the good things of this life, not
only for necessity, but for delight, that we may not only serve him, but
serve him cheerfully.

II\. Next morning he rained manna upon them, which was to be continued
to them for their daily bread. 1. That which was provided for them was
manna, which descended from the clouds, so that, in some sense, they
might be said to live upon the air. It came down in dew that melted, and
yet was itself of such a consistency as to serve for nourishing
strengthening food, without any thing else. They called it manna, manhu,
"What is this?" Either, "What a poor thing this is!" despising it: or,
"What a strange thing this is!" admiring it: or, "It is a portion, no
matter what it is; it is that which our God has allotted us, and we will
take it and be thankful," [Exo 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#014.md),
[Exo 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#015.md). It was pleasant food; the
Jews say that it was palatable to all, however varied their tastes. It
was wholesome food, light of digestion, and very necessary (Dr. Grew
says) to cleanse them from disorders with which he thinks it probable
that they were, in the time of their bondage, more or less infected,
which disorders a luxurious diet would have made contagious. By this
spare and plain diet we are all taught a lesson of temperance, and
forbidden to desire dainties and varieties. 2. They were to gather it
every morning ([Exo 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#021).md), the
portion of a day in his day, [Exo
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#004.md). Thus they must live upon daily
providence, as the fowls of the air, of which it is said, That which
thou givest them they gather ([Psa
104:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#028).md); not today for tomorrow: let
the morrow take thought for the things of itself. To this daily raining
and gathering of manna our Saviour seems to allude when he teaches us to
pray, Give us this day our daily bread. We are hereby taught, (1.)
Prudence and diligence in providing food convenient for ourselves and
our household. What God graciously gives we must industriously gather;
with quietness working, and eating our own bread, not the bread either
of idleness or deceit. God's bounty leaves room for man's duty; it did
so even when manna was rained: they must not eat till they have
gathered. (2.) Contentment and satisfaction with a sufficiency. They
must gather, every man according to his eating; enough is as good as a
feast, and more than enough is as bad as a surfeit. Those that have most
have, for themselves, but food, and raiment, and mirth; and those that
have least generally have these: so that he who gathers much has nothing
over, and he who gathers little has no lack. There is not so great a
disproportion between one and another in the comforts and enjoyments of
the things of this life as there is in the property and possession of
the things themselves. (3.) Dependence upon Providence: Let no man leave
till morning ([Exo 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#019).md), but let
them learn to go to bed and sleep quietly, though they have not a bit of
bread in their tent, nor in all their camp, trusting that God, with the
following day, will bring them their daily bread." It was surer and
safer in God's store-house than in their own, and would thence come to
them sweeter and fresher. Read with this, [Mat
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025.md), Take no thought for your life,
etc. See here the folly of hoarding. The manna that was laid up by some
(who thought themselves wiser and better managers than their neighbours,
and who would provide in case it should fail next day), putrefied, and
bred worms, and became good for nothing. Note, That proves to be most
wasted which is covetously and distrustfully spared. Those riches are
corrupted, [Jam 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#002.md), [Jam
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#003.md). Let us set ourselves to think,
\[1.\] Of that great power of God which fed Israel in the wilderness,
and made miracles their daily bread. What cannot this God do, who
prepared a table in the wilderness, and furnished it richly even for
those who questioned whether he could or no? [Psa
78:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#019.md), [Psa
78:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#020.md). Never was there such a market
of provisions as this, where so many hundred thousand men were daily
furnished, without money and without price. Never was there such an open
house kept as God kept in the wilderness for forty years together, nor
such free and plentiful entertainment given. The feast which Ahasuerus
made, to show the riches of his kingdom, and the honour of his majesty,
was nothing to this, [Est 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#004.md). It is
said ([Exo 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#021).md), When the sun waxed
hot, it melted; as if what was left were drawn up by the heat of the sun
into the air to be the seed of the next day's harvest, and so from day
to day. \[2.\] Of that constant providence of God which gives food to
all flesh, for his mercy endures for ever, [Psa
136:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#025.md). He is a great house-keeper
that provides for all the creatures. The same wisdom, power, and
goodness that now brought food daily out of the clouds, are employed in
the constant course of nature, bringing food yearly out of the earth,
and giving us all things richly to enjoy.

[Exodus 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 16:22</span></span>

We have here, 1. A plain intimation of the observing of a seventh day
sabbath, not only before the giving of the law upon Mount Sinai, but
before the bringing of Israel out of Egypt, and therefore, from the
beginning, [Gen 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#003.md). If the sabbath
had now been first instituted, how could Moses have understood what God
said to him ([Exo 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#005).md), concerning a
double portion to be gathered on the sixth day, without making any
express mention of the sabbath? And how could the people so readily take
the hint ([Exo 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#022).md), even to the
surprise of the rulers, before Moses had declared that it was done with
a regard to the sabbath, if they had not had some knowledge of the
sabbath before? The setting apart of one day in seven for holy work,
and, in order to that, for holy rest, was a divine appointment ever
since God created man upon the earth, and the most ancient of positive
laws. The way of sabbath-sanctification is the good old way. 2. The
double provision which God made for the Israelites, and which they were
to make for themselves, on the sixth day: God gave them on the sixth day
the bread of two days, [Exo 16:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#029.md).
Appointing them to rest on the seventh day, he took care that they
should be no losers by it; and none ever will be losers by serving God.
On that day they were to fetch in enough for two days, and to prepare
it, [Exo 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#023.md). The law was very
strict, that they must bake and seeth, the day before, and not on the
sabbath day. This does not now make it unlawful for us to dress meat on
the Lord's day, but directs us to contrive our family affairs so that
they may hinder us as little as possible in the work of the sabbath.
Works of necessity, no doubt, are to be done on that day; but it is
desirable to have as little as may be to do of things necessary to the
life that now is, that we may apply ourselves the more closely to the
one thing needful. That which they kept of for their food on the sabbath
day did not putrefy, [Exo 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#024.md). When
they kept it in opposition to a command ([Exo
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#020).md) it stank; when they kept it in
obedience to a command it was sweet and good; for every thing is
sanctified by the word of God and prayer. 3. The intermission of the
manna on the seventh day. God did not send it then, and therefore they
must not expect it, nor go out to gather, [Exo
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#025.md), [Exo
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#026.md). This showed that it was not
produced by natural causes, and that it was designed for a confirmation
of the divine authority of the law which was to be given by Moses. Thus
God took an effectual course to make them remember the sabbath day; they
could not forget it, nor the day of preparation for it. Some, it seems,
went out on the seventh day, expecting to find manna ([Exo
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#027).md); but they found none, for those
that will find must seek in the appointed time: seek the Lord while he
may be found. God, upon this occasion, said to Moses, How long refuse
you to keep my commandments? [Exo
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#028.md). Why did he say this to Moses?
He was not disobedient. No, but he was the ruler of a disobedient
people, and God charges it upon him that he might the more warmly charge
it upon them, and might take care that their disobedience should not be
through any neglect or default of his. It was for going out to seek for
manna on he seventh day that they were thus reproved. Note, (1.)
Disobedience, even in a small matter, is very provoking. (2.) God is
jealous for the honour of his sabbaths. If walking out on the sabbath to
seek for food was thus reproved, walking out on that day purely to find
our own pleasure cannot be justified.

[Exodus 16:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">exo 16:32</span></span>

God having provided manna to be his people's food in the wilderness, and
to be to them a continual feast, we are here told, 1. How the memory of
it was preserved. An omer of this manna was laid up in a golden pot, as
we are told ([Heb 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004).md), and kept
before the testimony, or the ark, when it was afterwards made, [Exo
16:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#032.md). The preservation of this
manna from waste and corruption was a standing miracle, and therefore
the more proper memorial of this miraculous food. "Posterity shall see
the bread," says God, "wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness," see
what sort of food it was, and how much each man's daily proportion of it
was, that it may appear they were neither kept to hard fare nor to short
allowance, and then judge between God and Israel, whether they had any
cause given them to murmur and find fault with their provisions, and
whether they and their seed after them had not a great deal of reason
gratefully to won God's goodness to them. Note, Eaten bread must not be
forgotten. God's miracles and mercies are to be had in everlasting
remembrance, for our encouragement to trust in him at all times. 2. How
the mercy of it was continued as long as they had occasion for it. The
manna never ceased till they came to the borders of Canaan, where there
was bread enough and to spare, [Exo
16:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#035.md). See how constant the care of
Providence is; seedtime and harvest fail not, while the earth remains.
Israel was very provoking in the wilderness, yet the manna never failed
them: thus still God causes his rain to fall on the just and unjust. The
manna is called spiritual meat ([Co1
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#003).md), because it was typical of
spiritual blessings in heavenly things. Christ himself is the true
manna, the bread of life, of which this was a figure, [Joh
6:49-51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#049.md). The word of God is the manna
by which our souls are nourished, [Mat
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#004.md). The comforts of the Spirit are
hidden manna, [Rev 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017.md). These come
from heaven, as the manna did, and are the support and comfort of the
divine life in the soul, while we are in the wilderness of this world.
It is food for Israelites, for those only that follow the pillar of
cloud and fire. It is to be gathered; Christ in the word is to be
applied to the soul, and the means of grace are to be used. We must
every one of us gather for ourselves, and gather in the morning of our
opportunities, which if we let slip, it may be too late to gather. The
manna they gathered must not be hoarded up, but eaten; those that have
received Christ must by faith live upon him, and not receive his grace
in vain. There was manna enough for all, enough for each, and none had
too much; so in Christ there is a complete sufficiency, and no
superfluity. But those that did eat manna hungered again, died at last,
and with many of them God was not well-pleased; whereas those that feed
on Christ by faith shall never hunger, and shall die no more, and with
them God will be for ever well pleased. The Lord evermore give us this
bread!
