### [2 Corinthians Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">co2 11:0</span></span>

In this chapter the apostle goes on with his discourse, in opposition to
the false apostles, who were very industrious to lessen his interest and
reputation among the Corinthians, and had prevailed too much by their
insinuations. I. He apologizes for going about to commend himself, and
gives the reason for what he did ([Co2
11:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001).md). II. He mentions, in his own
necessary vindication, his equality with the other apostles, and with
the false apostles in this particular of preaching the gospel to the
Corinthians freely, without wages ([Co2
11:5-15](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#005).md). III. He makes another
preface to what he was about further to say in his own justification
([Co2 11:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#016).md). And, IV. He gives a
large account of his qualifications, labours, and sufferings, in which
he exceeded the false apostles ([Co2
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#022) to the end.md).

[2 Corinthians 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 11:1</span></span>

Here we may observe, 1. The apology the apostle makes for going about to
commend himself. He is loth to enter upon this subject of
self-commendation: Would to God you could bear with me a little in my
folly, [Co2 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001.md). He calls this folly,
because too often it is really no better. In his case it was necessary;
yet, seeing others might apprehend it to be folly in him, he desires
them to bear with it. Note, As much against the grain as it is with a
proud man to acknowledge his infirmities, so much is it against the
grain with a humble man to speak in his own praise. It is no pleasure to
a good man to speak well of himself, yet in some cases it is lawful,
namely, when it is for the advantage of others, or for our own necessary
vindication; as thus it was here. For, 2. We have the reasons for what
the apostle did. (1.) To preserve the Corinthians from being corrupted
by the insinuations of the false apostles, [Co2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002.md), [Co2
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#003.md). He tells them he was jealous
over them with godly jealousy; he was afraid lest their faith should be
weakened by hearkening to such suggestions as tended to lessen their
regard to his ministry, by which they were brought to the Christian
faith. He had espoused them to one husband, that is, converted them to
Christianity (and the conversion of a soul is its marriage to the Lord
Jesus); and he was desirous to present them as a chaste virgin - pure,
and spotless, and faithful, not having their minds corrupted with false
doctrines by false teachers, as Eve was beguiled by the subtlety of the
serpent. This godly jealousy in the apostle was a mixture of love and
fear; and faithful ministers cannot but be afraid and concerned for
their people, lest they should lose that which they have received, and
turn from what they have embraced, especially when deceivers have gone
abroad, or have crept in among them. (2.) To vindicate himself against
the false apostles, forasmuch as they could not pretend they had another
Jesus, or another Spirit, or another gospel, to preach to them, [Co2
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#004.md). If this had been the case, there
would have been some colour of reason to bear with them, or to hearken
to them. But seeing there is but one Jesus, one Spirit, and one gospel,
that is, or at least that ought to be, preached to them and received by
them, what reason could there be why the Corinthians should be
prejudiced against him, who first converted them to the faith, by the
artifices of any adversary? It was a just occasion of jealousy that such
persons designed to preach another Jesus, another Spirit, and another
gospel.

[2 Corinthians 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 11:5</span></span>

After the foregoing preface to what he was about to say, the apostle in
these verses mentions,

I. His equality with the other apostles - that he was not a whit behind
the very chief of the apostles, [Co2
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#005.md). This he expresses very modestly:
I suppose so. He might have spoken very positively. The apostleship, as
an office, was equal in all the apostles; but the apostles, like other
Christians, differed one from another. These stars differed one from
another in glory, and Paul was indeed of the first magnitude; yet he
speaks modestly of himself, and humbly owns his personal infirmity, that
he was rude in speech, had not such a graceful delivery as some others
might have. Some think that he was a man of very low stature, and that
his voice was proportionably small; others think that he may have had
some impediment in his speech, perhaps a stammering tongue. However, he
was not rude in knowledge; he was not unacquainted with the best rules
of oratory and the art of persuasion, much less was he ignorant of the
mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, as had been thoroughly manifested
among them.

II\. His equality with the false apostles in this particular - the
preaching of the gospel unto them freely, without wages. This the
apostle largely insists on, and shows that, as they could not but own
him to be a minister of Christ, so they ought to acknowledge he had been
a good friend to them. For, 1. He had preached the gospel to them
freely, [Co2 11:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#007.md). He had proved at
large, in his former epistle to them, the lawfulness of ministers'
receiving maintenance from the people, and the duty of the people to
give them an honourable maintenance; and here he says he himself had
taken wages of other churches ([Co2
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#008).md), so that he had a right to have
asked and received from them: yet he waived his right, and chose rather
to abase himself, by working with his hands in the trade of tent-making
to maintain himself, than be burdensome to them, that they might be
exalted, or encouraged to receive the gospel, which they had so cheaply;
yea, he chose rather to be supplied from Macedonia than to be chargeable
unto them. 2. He informs them of the reason of this his conduct among
them. It was not because he did not love them ([Co2
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#011).md), or was unwilling to receive
tokens of their love (for love and friendship are manifested by mutual
giving and receiving), but it was to avoid offence, that he might cut
off occasion from those that desired occasion. He would not give
occasion for any to accuse him of worldly designs in preaching the
gospel, or that he intended to make a trade of it, to enrich himself;
and that others who opposed him at Corinth might not in this respect
gain an advantage against him: that wherein they gloried, as to this
matter, they might be found even as he, [Co2
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#012.md). It is not improbable to suppose
that the chief of the false teachers at Corinth, or some among them,
were rich, and taught (or deceived) the people freely, and might accuse
the apostle or his fellow-labourers as mercenary men, who received hire
or wages, and therefore the apostle kept to his resolution not to be
chargeable to any of the Corinthians.

III\. The false apostles are charged as deceitful workers ([Co2
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#013).md), and that upon this account,
because they would transform themselves into the likeness of the
apostles of Christ, and, though they were the ministers of Satan, would
seem to be the ministers of righteousness. They would be as industrious
and as generous in promoting error as the apostles were in preaching
truth; they would endeavour as much to undermine the kingdom of Christ
as the apostles did to establish it. There were counterfeit prophets
under the Old Testament, who wore the garb and learned the language of
the prophets of the Lord. So there were counterfeit apostles under the
New Testament, who seemed in many respects like the true apostles of
Christ. And no marvel (says the apostle); hypocrisy is a thing not to be
much wondered at in this world, especially when we consider the great
influence Satan has upon the minds of many, who rules in the hearts of
the children of disobedience. As he can turn himself into any shape, and
put on almost any form, and look sometimes like an angel of light, in
order to promote his kingdom of darkness, so he will teach his ministers
and instruments to do the same. But it follows, Their end is according
to their works ([Co2 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#015).md); the end
will discover them to be deceitful workers, and their work will end in
ruin and destruction.

[2 Corinthians 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 11:16</span></span>

Here we have a further excuse that the apostle makes for what he was
about to say in his own vindication. 1. He would not have them think he
was guilty of folly, in saying what he said to vindicate himself: Let no
man think me a fool, [Co2 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#016.md).
Ordinarily, indeed, it is unbecoming a wise man to be much and often
speaking in his own praise. Boasting of ourselves is usually not only a
sign of a proud mind, but a mark of folly also. However, says the
apostle, yet as a fool receive me; that is, if you count it folly in me
to boast a little, yet give due regard to what I shall say. 2. He
mentions a caution, to prevent the abuse of what he should say, telling
them that what he spoke, he did not speak after the Lord, [Co2
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#017.md). He would not have them think
that boasting of ourselves, or glorying in what we have, is a thing
commanded by the Lord in general unto Christians, nor yet that this is
always necessary in our own vindication; though it may be lawfully used,
because not contrary to the Lord, when, strictly speaking, it is not
after the Lord. It is the duty and practice of Christians, in obedience
to the command and example of the Lord, rather to humble and abase
themselves; yet prudence must direct in what circumstances it is needful
to do that which we may do lawfully, even speak of what God has wrought
for us, and in us, and by us too. 3. He gives a good reason why they
should suffer him to boast a little; namely, because they suffered
others to do so who had less reason. Seeing many glory after the flesh
(of carnal privileges, or outward advantages and attainments), I will
glory also, [Co2 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#018.md). But he would
not glory in those things, though he had as much or more reason than
others to do so. But he gloried in his infirmities, as he tells them
afterwards. The Corinthians thought themselves wise, and might think it
an instance of wisdom to bear with the weakness of others, and therefore
suffered others to do what might seem folly; therefore the apostle would
have them bear with him. Or these words, You suffer fools gladly, seeing
you yourselves are wise ([Co2 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#019).md),
may be ironical, and then the meaning is this: "Notwithstanding all your
wisdom, you willingly suffer yourselves to be brought into bondage under
the Jewish yoke, or suffer others to tyrannize over you; nay, to devour
you, or make a prey of you, and take of you hire for their own
advantage, and to exalt themselves above you, and lord it over you; nay,
even to smite you on the face, or impose upon you to your very faces
([Co2 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#020).md), upbraiding you while
they reproach me, as if you had been very weak in showing regard to me,"
[Co2 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#021.md). Seeing this was the case,
that the Corinthians, or some among them, could so easily bear all this
from the false apostles, it was reasonable for the apostle to desire,
and expect, they should bear with what might seem to them an
indiscretion in him, seeing the circumstances of the case were such as
made it needful that whereinsoever any were bold he should be bold also,
[Co2 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#021.md).

[2 Corinthians 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co2 11:22</span></span>

Here the apostle gives a large account of his own qualifications,
labours, and sufferings (not out of pride or vain-glory, but to the
honour of God, who had enabled him to do and suffer so much for the
cause of Christ), and wherein he excelled the false apostles, who would
lessen his character and usefulness among the Corinthians. Observe,

I. He mentions the privileges of his birth ([Co2
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#022).md), which were equal to any they
could pretend to. He was a Hebrew of the Hebrews; of a family among the
Jews that never intermarried with the Gentiles. He was also an
Israelite, and could boast of his being descended from the beloved Jacob
as well as they, and was also of the seed of Abraham, and not of the
proselytes. It should seem from this that the false apostles were of the
Jewish race, who gave disturbance to the Gentile converts.

II\. He makes mention also of his apostleship, that he was more than an
ordinary minister of Christ, [Co2
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023.md). God had counted him faithful,
and had put him into the ministry. He had been a useful minister of
Christ unto them; they had found full proofs of his ministry: Are they
ministers of Christ? I am more so.

III\. He chiefly insists upon this, that he had been an extraordinary
sufferer for Christ; and this was what he gloried in, or rather he
gloried in the grace of God that had enabled him to be more abundant in
labours, and to endure very great sufferings, such as stripes above
measure, frequent imprisonments, and often the dangers of death, [Co2
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023.md). Note, When the apostle would
prove himself an extraordinary minister, he proves that he had been an
extraordinary sufferer. Paul was the apostle of the Gentiles, and for
that reason was hated of the Jews. They did all they could against him;
and among the Gentiles also he met with hard usage. Bonds and
imprisonments were familiar to him; never was the most notorious
malefactor more frequently in the hands of public justice than Paul was
for righteousness' sake. The jail and the whipping-post, and all other
hard usages of those who are accounted the worst of men, were what he
was accustomed to. As to the Jews, whenever he fell into their hands,
they never spared him. Five times he fell under their lash, and received
forty stripes save one, [Co2 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#024.md).
Forty stripes was the utmost their law allowed ([Deu
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#003).md), but it was usual with them,
that they might not exceed, to abate one at least of that number. And to
have the abatement of one only was all the favour that ever Paul
received from them. The Gentiles were not tied up to that moderation,
and among them he was thrice beaten with rods, of which we may suppose
once was at Philippi, [Act 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#022.md). Once
he was stoned in a popular tumult, and was taken up for dead, [Act
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019.md). He says that thrice he suffered
shipwreck; and we may believe him, though the sacred history gives a
relation but of one. A night and a day he had been in the deep ([Co2
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#025).md), in some deep dungeon or other,
shut up as a prisoner. Thus he was all his days a constant confessor;
perhaps scarcely a year of his life, after his conversion, passed
without suffering some hardship or other for his religion; yet this was
not all, for, wherever he went, he went in perils; he was exposed to
perils of all sorts. If he journeyed by land, or voyaged by sea, he was
in perils of robbers, or enemies of some sort; the Jews, his own
countrymen, sought to kill him, or do him a mischief; the heathen, to
whom he was sent, were not more kind to him, for among them he was in
peril. If he was in the city, or in the wilderness, still he was in
peril. He was in peril not only among avowed enemies, but among those
also who called themselves brethren, but were false brethren, [Co2
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#026.md). Besides all this, he had great
weariness and painfulness in his ministerial labours, and these are
things that will come into account shortly, and people will be reckoned
with for all the care and pains of their ministers concerning them. Paul
was a stranger to wealth and plenty, power and pleasure, preferment and
ease; he was in watchings often, and exposed to hunger and thirst; in
fastings often, it may be out of necessity; and endured cold and
nakedness, [Co2 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#027.md). Thus was he,
who was one of the greatest blessings of the age, used as if he had been
the burden of the earth, and the plague of his generation. And yet this
is not all; for, as an apostle, the care of all the churches lay on him,
[Co2 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#028.md). He mentions this last, as
if this lay the heaviest upon him, and as if he could better bear all
the persecutions of his enemies than the scandals that were to be found
in the churches he had the oversight of. Who is weak, and I am not weak?
Who is offended, and I burn not? [Co2
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#029.md). There was not a weak Christian
with whom he did not sympathize, nor any one scandalized, but he was
affected therewith. See what little reason we have to be in love with
the pomp and plenty of this world, when this blessed apostle, one of the
best of men that ever lived, excepting Jesus Christ, felt so much
hardship in it. Nor was he ashamed of all this, but, on the contrary, it
was what he accounted his honour; and therefore, much against the grain
as it was with him to glory, yet, says he, if I must needs glory, if my
adversaries will oblige me to it in my own necessary vindication, I will
glory in these my infirmities, [Co2
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#030.md). Note, Sufferings for
righteousness' sake will, the most of any thing, redound to our honour.

In the last two verses, he mentions one particular part of his
sufferings out of its place, as if he had forgotten it before, or
because the deliverance God wrought for him was most remarkable; namely,
the danger he was in at Damascus, soon after he was converted, and not
settled in Christianity, at least in the ministry and apostleship. This
is recorded, [Act 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#024.md), [Act
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#025.md). This was his first great danger
and difficulty, and the rest of his life was a piece with this. And it
is observable that, lest it should be thought he spoke more than was
true, the apostle confirms this narrative with a solemn oath, or appeal
to the omniscience of God, [Co2 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#031.md).
It is a great comfort to a good man that the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ, who is an omniscient God, knows the truth of all he says,
and knows all he does and all he suffers for his sake.
