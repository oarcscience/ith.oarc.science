### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 29:0</span></span>

How Saul, who was forsaken of God, when he was in a strait was more and
more perplexed and embarrassed with his own counsels, we read in the
foregoing chapter. In this chapter we find how David, who kept close to
God, when he was in a strait was extricated and brought off by the
providence of God, without any contrivance of his own. We have him, I.
Marching with the Philistines ([Sa1
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001.md), [Sa1
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#002).md). II. Excepted against by the
lords of the Philistines ([Sa1
29:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#003).md). III. Happily dismissed by
Achish from that service which did so ill become him, and which yet he
knew not how to decline ([Sa1
29:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#006).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 29:1</span></span>

Here is, I. The great strait that David was in, which we may suppose he
himself was aware of, though we read not of his asking advice from God,
nor of any project of his own to get clear of it. The two armies of the
Philistines and the Israelites were encamped and ready to engage, [Sa1
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001.md). Achish, who had been kind to
David, had obliged him to come himself and bring the forces he had into
his service. David came accordingly, and, upon a review of the army, was
found with Achish, in the post assigned him in the rear, [Sa1
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#002.md). Now, 1. If, when the armies
engaged, he should retire, and quit his post, he would fall under the
indelible reproach, not only of cowardice and treachery, but of base
ingratitude to Achish, who had been his protector and benefactor and had
reposed a confidence in him, and from whom he had received a very
honourable commission. Such an unprincipled thing as this he could by no
means persuade himself to do. 2. If he should, as was expected from him,
fight for the Philistines against Israel, he would incur the imputation
of being an enemy to the Israel of God and a traitor to his country,
would make his own people hate him, and unanimously oppose his coming to
the crown, as unworthy the name of an Israelite, much more the honour
and trust of a king of Israel, when he had fought against them under the
banner of the uncircumcised. If Saul should be killed (as it proved he
was) in this engagement, the fault would be laid at David's door, as if
he had killed him. So that on each side there seemed to be both sin and
scandal. This was the strait he was in; and a great strait it was to a
good man, greater to see sin before him than to see trouble. Into this
strait he brought himself by his own unadvisedness, in quitting the land
of Judah, and going among the uncircumcised. It is strange if those that
associate themselves with wicked people, and grow intimate with them,
come off without guilt, or grief, or both. What he himself proposed to
do does not appear. Perhaps he designed to act only as keeper to the
king's head, the post assigned him ([Sa1
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#002).md) and not to do any thing
offensively against Israel. But it would have been very hard to come so
near the brink of sin and not to fall in. Therefore, though God might
justly have left him in this difficulty, to chastise him for his folly,
yet, because his heart was upright with him, he would not suffer him to
be tempted above what he was able, but with the temptation made a way
for him to escape, [Co1 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013.md).

II\. A door opened for his deliverance out of this strait. God inclined
the hearts of the princes of the Philistines to oppose his being
employed in the battle, and to insist upon his being dismissed. Thus
their enmity befriended him, when no friend he had was capable of doing
him such a kindness. 1. It was a proper question which they asked, upon
the mustering of the forces, "What do these Hebrews here? [Sa1
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#003.md). What confidence can we put in
them, or what service can we expect from them?" A Hebrew is out of his
place, and, if he has the spirit of a Hebrew, is out of his element,
when he is in the camp of the Philistines, and deserves to be made
uneasy there. David used to hate the congregation of evil doers, however
he came now to be among them, [Psa
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#005.md). It was an honourable testimony
which Achish, on this occasion, gave to David. He looked upon him as a
refugee, that fled from a wrongful prosecution in his own country, and
had put himself under his protection, whom therefore he was obliged, in
justice, to take care of, and thought he might in prudence employ; "for
(says he) he has been with me these days, or these years," that is, a
considerable time, many days at his court and a year or two in his
country, and he never found any fault in him, nor saw any cause to
distrust his fidelity, or to think any other than that he had heartily
come over to him. By this it appears that David had conducted himself
with a great deal of caution, and had prudently concealed the affection
he still retained for his own people. We have need to walk in wisdom
towards those that are without, to keep our mouth when the wicked is
before us, and to be upon the reserve. 3. Yet the princes are peremptory
in it, that he must be sent home; and they give good reasons for their
insisting on it. (1.) Because he had been an old enemy to the
Philistines; witness what was sung in honour of his triumphs over them:
Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands, [Sa1
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#005.md). "It will be a reproach to us to
harbour and trust so noted a destroyer of our people; nor can it be
thought that he will now act heartily against Saul who then acted so
vigorously with him and for him." Who would be fond of popular praise or
applause when, even that may, another time, be turned against a man to
his reproach? (2.) Because he might be a most dangerous enemy to them,
and do them more mischief then all Saul's army could ([Sa1
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#004).md): "He may in the battle be an
adversary to us, and surprise us with an attack in the rear, while their
army charges us in the front; and we have reason to think he will do so,
that, by betraying us, he may reconcile himself to his master. Who can
trust a man who, besides his affection to his country, will think it his
interest to be false to us?" It is dangerous to put confidence in a
reconciled enemy.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 29:6</span></span>

If the reasons Achish had to trust David were stronger than the reasons
which the princes offered why they should distrust him (as I do not see
that, in policy, they were, for the princes were certainly in the
right), yet Achish was but one of five, though the chief, and the only
one that had the title of king; accordingly, in a council of war held on
this occasion, he was over-voted, and obliged to dismiss David, though
he was extremely fond of him. Kings cannot always do as they would, nor
have such as they would about them.

I. The discharge Achish gives him is very honourable, and not a final
discharge, but only from the present service. 1. He signifies the great
pleasure and satisfaction he had taken in him and in his conversation:
Thou art good in my sight as an angel of God, [Sa1
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#009.md). Wise and good men will gain
respect, wherever they go, from all that know how to make a right
estimate of persons and things, though of different professions in
religion. What Achish says of David, God, by the prophet, says of the
house of David ([Zac 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008).md), that it
shall be as the angel of the Lord. But the former is a court-compliment;
the latter is a divine promise. 2. He gives him a testimonial of his
good behaviour, [Sa1 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#006.md). It is very
full and in obliging terms: "Thou hast been upright, and thy whole
conduct has been good in my sight, and I have not found evil in thee."
Saul would not have given him such a testimonial, though he had done far
more service to him than Achish. God's people should behave themselves
always so inoffensively as if possible to get the good word of all they
have dealings with; and it is a debt we owe to those who have acquitted
themselves well to give them the praise of it. 3. He lays all the blame
of his dismission upon the princes, who would by no means suffer him to
continue in the camp. "The king loves thee entirely, and would venture
his life in thy hand; but the lords favour thee not, and we must not
disoblige them, nor can we oppose them; therefore return and go in
peace." He had better part with his favourite than occasion a disgust
among his generals and a mutiny in his army. Achish intimates a reason
why they were uneasy. It was not so much for David's own sake as for the
sake of his soldiers that attended him, whom he calls his master's
servants (namely, Saul's), [Sa1 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#010.md).
They could trust him, but not them. (4.) He orders him to be gone early,
as soon as it was light ([Sa1 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#010).md),
to prevent their further resentments, and the jealousies they would have
been apt to conceive if he had lingered.

II\. His reception of this discourse is very complimental; but, I fear,
not without some degree of dissimulation. "What?" says David, "must I
leave my lord the king, whom I am bound by office to protect, just now
when he is going to expose himself in the field? Why may not I go and
fight against the enemies of my lord the king?" [Sa1
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#008.md). He seemed anxious to serve him
when he was at this juncture really anxious to leave him, but he was not
willing that Achish should know that he was. No one knows how strong the
temptation is to compliment and dissemble which those are in that attend
great men, and how hard it is to avoid it.

III\. God's providence ordered it wisely and graciously for him. For,
besides that the snare was broken and he was delivered out of the
dilemma to which he was first reduced, it proved a happy hastening of
him to the relief of his own city, which sorely wanted him, though he
did not know it. Thus the disgrace which the lords of the Philistines
put upon him prove, in more ways than one, an advantage to him. The
steps of a good man ore ordered by the Lord, and he delighteth in his
way. What he does with us we know not now, but we shall know hereafter,
and shall see it was all for good.
