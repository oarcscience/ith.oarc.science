### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 5:0</span></span>

Two more of Elisha's miracles are recorded in this chapter. I. The
cleansing of Naaman, a Syrian, a stranger, from his leprosy, and there,
1. The badness of his case ([Kg2 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#001).md).
2. The providence that brought him to Elisha, the intelligence given him
by a captive maid ([Kg2 5:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#002).md). A
letter from the king of Syria to the king of Israel, to introduce him
([Kg2 5:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#005).md). And the invitation
Elisha sent him ([Kg2 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#008).md). 3. The
method prescribed for his cure, his submission, with much ado, to that
method, and his cure thereby ([Kg2
5:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#009).md). 4. The grateful
acknowledgments he made to Elisha hereupon ([Kg2
5:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#015).md). II. The smiting of Gehazi,
his own servant, with that leprosy. 1. Gehazi's sins, which were belying
his master to Naaman ([Kg2 5:20-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#020).md),
and lying to his master when he examined him ([Kg2
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#025).md). 2. His punishment for these
sins. Naaman's leprosy was entailed on his family ([Kg2
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#026.md), [Kg2
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#027).md). And, if Naaman's cure was
typical of the calling of the Gentiles, as our Saviour seems to make it
([Luk 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#027).md), Gehazi's stroke may be
looked upon as typical of the blinding and rejecting of the Jews, who
envied God's grace to the Gentiles, as Gehazi envied Elisha's favour to
Naaman.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 5:1</span></span>

Our saviour's miracles were intended for the lost sheep of the house of
Israel, yet one, like a crumb, fell from the table to a woman of Canaan;
so this one miracle Elisha wrought for Naaman, a Syrian; for God does
good to all, and will have all men to be saved. Here is,

I. The great affliction Naaman was under, in the midst of all his
honours, [Kg2 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#001.md). He was a great man,
in a great place; not only rich and raised, but particularly happy for
two things: - 1. That he had been very serviceable to his country. God
made him so: By him the Lord had often given deliverance to Syria,
success in their wars even with Israel. The preservation and prosperity
even of those that do not know God and serve him must be ascribed to
him, for he is the Saviour of all men, but especially of those that
believe. Let Israel know that when the Syrians prevailed it was from the
Lord. 2. That he was very acceptable to his prince, was his favourite,
and prime-minister of state; so great was he, so high, so honourable,
and a mighty man of valour; but he was a leper, was under that loathsome
disease, which made him a burden to himself. Note, (1.) No man's
greatness, or honour, or interest, or valour, or victory, can set him
out of the reach of the sorest calamities of human life; there is many a
sickly crazy body under rich and gay clothing. (2.) Every man has some
but or other in his character, something that blemishes and diminishes
him, some allay to his grandeur, some damp to his joy; he may be very
happy, very good, yet, in something or other, not so good as he should
be nor so happy as he would be. Naaman was a great as the world could
make him, and yet (as bishop Hall expresses it) the basest slave in
Syria would not change skins with him.

II\. The notice that was given him of Elisha's power, by a little maid
that waited on his lady, [Kg2 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#002.md),
[Kg2 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#003.md). This maid was, by birth, an
Israelite, providentially carried captive into Syria, and there
preferred into Naaman's family, where she published Elisha's fame to the
honour of Israel and Israel's God. The unhappy dispersing of the people
of God has sometimes proved the happy occasion of the diffusion of the
knowledge of God, [Act 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#004.md). This
little maid, 1. As became a true-born Israelite, consulted the honour of
her country, and could give an account, though but a girl, of the famous
prophet they had among them. Children should betimes acquaint themselves
with the wondrous works of God, that, wherever they go, they may have
them to talk of. See [Psa 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#002.md). 2. As
became a good servant, she desired the health and welfare of her master,
though she was a captive, a servant by force; much more should servants
of choice seek their masters' good. The Jews in Babylon were to seek the
peace of the land of their captivity. [Jer
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#007.md). Elisha had not cleansed any
leper in Israel ([Luk 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#027).md), yet this
little maid, from the other miracles he had wrought, inferred that he
could cure her master, and from his common beneficence inferred that he
would do it, though he was a Syrian. Servants may be blessings to the
families where they are, by telling what they know of the glory of God
and the honour of his prophets.

III\. The application which the king of Syria hereupon made to the king
of Israel on Naaman's behalf. Naaman took notice of the intelligence,
though given by a simple maid, and did not despise it for the sake of
her meanness, when it tended to his bodily health. he did not say, "The
girl talks like a fool; how can any prophet of Israel do that for me
which all the physicians of Syria have attempted in vain?" Though he
neither loved nor honoured the Jewish nation, yet, if one of that nation
can but cure him of his leprosy, he will thankfully acknowledge the
obligation. O that those who are spiritually diseased would hearken thus
readily to the tidings brought them of the great Physician! See what
Naaman did upon this little hint. 1. He would not send for the prophet
to come to him, but such honour would he pay to one that had so much of
a divine power with him as to be able to cure diseases that he would go
to him himself, though he himself was sickly, unfit for society, the
journey long, and the country an enemy's; princes, he thinks, must stoop
to prophets when they need them. 2. He would not go incognito - in
disguise, though his errand proclaimed his loathsome disease, but went
in state, and with a great retinue, to do the more honour to the
prophet. 3. He would not go empty-handed, but took with him gold,
silver, and raiment, to present to his physician. Those that have
wealth, and want health show which they reckon the more valuable
blessing; what will they not give for ease, and strength, and soundness
of body? 4. He would not go without a letter to the king of Israel from
the king his master, who did himself earnestly desire his recovery. He
knows not where in Samaria to find this wonder-working prophet, but
takes it for granted the king knows where to find him; and, to engage
the prophet to do his utmost for Naaman, he will go to him supported
with the interest of two kings. If the king of Syria must entreat his
help, he hopes the king of Israel, being his liege-lord, may command it.
The gifts of the subject must all be (he thinks) for the service and
honour of the prince, and therefore he desires the king that he would
recover the leper ([Kg2 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#006).md), taking
it for granted that there was a greater intimacy between the king and
the prophet than really there was.

IV\. The alarm this gave to the king of Israel, [Kg2
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#007.md). He apprehended there was in this
letter, 1. A great affront upon God, and therefore he rent his clothes,
according to the custom of the Jews when they heard or read that which
they thought blasphemous; and what less could it be than to attribute to
him a divine power? "Am I a God, to kill whom I will, and make alive
whom I will? No, I pretend not to such an authority." Nebuchadnezzar
did, as we find, [Dan 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#019.md). "Am I a
God, to kill with a word, and make alive with a word? No, I pretend not
to such a power;" thus this great man, this bad man, is made to own that
he is but a man. Why did he not, with this consideration, correct
himself for his idolatry, and reason thus: - Shall I worship those as
gods that can neither kill nor make alive, can do neither good nor evil?
2. A bad design upon himself. He appeals to those about him for this:
"See how he seeketh a quarrel against me; he requires me to recover the
leper, and if I do not, though I cannot, he will make that a pretence to
wage war with me," which he suspects the rather because Naaman is his
general. had he rightly understood the meaning of the letter, that when
the king wrote to him to recover the leper he meant that he would take
care he might be recovered, he would not have been in this fright. Note,
We often create a great deal of uneasiness to ourselves by
misinterpreting the words and actions of others that are well intended:
it is charity to ourselves to think no evil. If he had bethought himself
of Elisha, and his power, he would easily have understood the letter,
and have known what he had to do; but he is put into this confusion by
making himself a stranger to the prophet: the captive maid had him more
in her thoughts than the king had.

V. The proffer which Elisha made of his services. He was willing to do
any thing to make his prince easy, though he was neglected and his
former good services were forgotten by him. Hearing on which occasion
the king had rent his clothes, he sent to him to let him know that if
his patient would come to him he should not lose his labour ([Kg2
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#008).md): He shall know that there is a
prophet in Israel (and it were sad with Israel if there were not), that
there is a prophet in Israel who can do that which the king of Israel
dares not attempt, which the prophets of Syria cannot pretend to. It was
not for his own honour, but for the honour of God, that he coveted to
make them all know that there was a prophet in Israel, though obscure
and overlooked.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 5:9</span></span>

We have here the cure of Naaman's leprosy.

I. The short and plain direction which the prophet gave him, with
assurance of success. Naaman designed to do honour to Elisha when he
came in his chariot, and with all his retinue, to Elisha's door, [Kg2
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#009.md). Those that showed little respect
to prophets at other times were very complaisant to them when they
needed them. He attended at Elisha's door as a beggar for an alms. Those
that would be cleansed from the spiritual leprosy must wait at Wisdom's
gate, and watch at the posts of her doors. Naaman expected to have his
compliment returned, but Elisha gave him his answer without any
formality, would not go to the door to him, lest he should seem too much
pleased with the honour done him, but sent a messenger to him, saying,
Go wash in Jordan seven times, and promising him that if he did so his
disease should be cured. The promise was express: Thou shalt be clean.
The method prescribed was plain: Go wash in Jordan. This was not
intended as any means of the cure; for, though cold bathing is
recommended by many as a very wholesome thing, yet some think that in
the case of a leprosy it was rather hurtful. But it was intended as a
sign of the cure, and a trial of his obedience. Those that will be
helped of God must do as they are bidden. But why did Elisha send a
messenger to him with these directions? 1. Because he had retired, at
this time, for devotion, was intent upon his prayers for the cure, and
would not be diverted; or, 2. Because he knew Naaman to be a proud man,
and he would let him know that before the great God all men stand upon
the same level.

II\. Naaman's disgust at the method prescribed, because it was not what
he expected. Two things disgusted him: -

1\. That Elisha, as he thought, put a slight upon his person, in sending
him orders by a servant, and not coming to him himself, [Kg2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#011.md). Being big with the expectation
of a cure, he had been fancying how this cure would be wrought, and the
scheme he had laid was this: "He will surely come out to me, that is the
least he can do to me, a peer of Syria, to me that have come to him in
all this state, to me that have so often been victorious over Israel. He
will stand, and call on the name of his God, and name me in his prayer,
and then he will wave his hand over the place, and so effect the cure."
And, because the thing was not done just thus, he fell into a passion,
forgetting, (1.) That he was a leper, and the law of Moses, which Elisha
would religiously observe, shut lepers out from society - a leper, and
therefore he ought not to insist upon the punctilios of honor. Note,
Many have hearts unhumbled under humbling providences; see [Num
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#014). (2..md) That he was a petitioner,
suing for a favour which he could not demand; and beggars must not be
choosers, patients must not prescribe to their physicians. See in Naaman
the folly of pride. A cure will not content him unless he be cured with
ceremony, with a great deal of pomp and parade; he scorns to be healed,
unless he be humoured.

2\. That Elisha, as he thought, put a slight upon his country. He took
it hard that he must be sent to wash in Jordan, a river of Israel, when
he thought Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the
waters of Israel. How magnificently does he speak of these two rivers
that watered Damascus, which soon after fell into one, called by
geographers Chrysoroas - the golden stream! How scornfully does he speak
of all the waters of Israel, though God had called the land of Israel
the glory of all lands, and particularly for its brooks of water! [Deu
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#007.md). So common it is for God and man
to differ in their judgments. How slightly does he speak of the
prophet's directions! May I not wash in them and be clean? He might wash
in them and be clean from dirt, but not wash in them and be clean from
leprosy. He was angry that the prophet bade him wash and be clean; he
thought that the prophet must do all and was not pleased that he was
bidden to do any thing, - or he thought this too cheap, too plain, too
common a thing for so great a man to be cured by, - or he did not
believe it would at all effect the cure, or, if it would, what medicinal
virtue was there in Jordan more than in the rivers of Damascus? But he
did not consider, (1.) That Jordan belonged to Israel's God, from whom
he was to expect the cure, and not from the gods of Damascus; it watered
the Lord's land, the holy land, and, in a miraculous cure, relation to
God was much more considerable than the depth of the channel or the
beauty of the stream. (2.) That Jordan had more than once before this
obeyed the commands of omnipotence. It had of old yielded a passage to
Israel, and of late to Elijah and Elisha, and therefore was fitter for
such a purpose than those rivers which had only observed the common law
of their creation, and had never been thus distinguished; but, above
all, (3.) Jordan was the river appointed, and, if he expected a cure
from the divine power, he ought to acquiesce in the divine will, without
asking why or wherefore. Note, It is common for those that are wise in
their own conceit to look with contempt on the dictates and
prescriptions of divine wisdom and to prefer their own fancies before
them; those that are for establishing their own righteousness will not
submit to the righteousness of God, [Rom
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#003.md). Naaman talked himself into such
a heat (as passionate men usually do) that he turned away from the
prophet's door in a rage, ready to swear he would never have any thing
more to say to Elisha; and who then would be the loser? Note, Those that
observe lying vanities forsake their own mercies. [Jon
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#008.md). Proud men are the worst enemies
to themselves and forego their own redemption.

III\. The modest advice which his servants gave him, to observe the
prophet's prescriptions, with a tacit reproof of his resentments, [Kg2
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#013.md). Though at other times they kept
their distance, and now saw him in a passion, yet, knowing him to be a
man that would hear reason at any time, and from any body (a good
character of great men, and a very rare one), they drew near, and made
bold to argue the matter a little with him. They had conceived a great
opinion of the prophet (having, perhaps, heard more of him from the
common people, whom they had conversed with, than Naaman had heard from
the king and courtiers, whom he had conversed with), and therefore
begged of him to consider: "If the prophet had bidden thee to do some
great thing, had ordered thee into a tedious course of physic, or to
submit to some painful operation, blistering, or cupping, or salivating,
Wouldst thou not have done it? No doubt thou wouldst. And wilt thou not
submit to so easy a method as this, Wash and be clean?" Observe, 1. His
own servants gave him this reproof and counsel, which was no more
disparagement to him than that he had intelligence of one that could
cure him from his wife's maid, [Kg2
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#003.md). Note, It is a great mercy to have
those about us that will be free with us, and faithfully tell us of our
faults and follies, though they be our inferiors. Masters must be
willing to hear reason from their servants, [Job
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#013.md), [Job
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#014.md). As we should be deaf to the
counsel of the ungodly, though given by the greatest and most venerable
names, so we should have our ear open to good advice, though brought us
by those who are much below us: no matter who speaks, if the thing be
well said. 2. The reproof was very modest and respectful. They call him
Father; for servants must honour and obey their masters with a kind of
filial affection. In giving reproof or counsel we must make it appear
that it comes from love and true honour, and that we intend, not
reproach, but reformation. 3. It was very rational and considerate. If
the rude and unthinking servants had stirred up their master's angry
resentment, and offered to avenge his quarrel upon the prophet, who (he
thought) affronted him, how mischievous would the consequences have
been! Fire from heaven, probably, upon them all! But they, to our great
surprise, took the prophet's part. Elisha, though it is likely he
perceived that what he had said had put Naaman out of humour, did not
care to pacify him: it was at his peril if he persisted in his wrath.
But his servants were made use of by Providence to reduce him to temper.
They reasoned with him, (1.) From his earnest desire of a cure: Wouldst
thou not do any thing? Note, When diseased sinners come to this, that
they are content to do any thing, to submit to any thing, to part with
any thing, for a cure, then, and not till then, there begin to be some
hopes of them. Then they will take Christ on his own terms when they are
made willing to have Christ upon any terms. (2.) From the easiness of
the method prescribed: "It is but, Wash and be clean. It is but trying;
the experiment is cheap and easy, it can do no hurt, but may do good."
Note, the methods prescribed for the healing of the leprosy of sin are
so plain that we are utterly inexcusable if we do not observe them. It
is but, "Believe, and be saved" - "Repent, and be pardoned" - "Wash, and
be clean."

IV\. The cure effected, in the use of the means prescribed, [Kg2
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#014.md). Naaman, upon second thoughts,
yielded to make the experiment, yet, it should seem, with no great faith
and resolution; for, whereas the prophet bade him wash in Jordan seven
times, he did but dip himself so many times, as lightly as he could.
However God was pleased so far to honour himself and his word as to make
that effectual. His flesh came again, like the flesh of a child. to his
great surprise and joy. This men get by yielding to the will of God, by
attending to his institutions. His being cleansed by washing put an
honour on the law for cleansing lepers. God will magnify his word above
all his name.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 5:15</span></span>

Of the ten lepers that our Saviour cleansed, the only one that returned
to give thanks was a Samaritan, [Luk
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#016.md). This Syrian did so, and here
expresses himself.

I. Convinced of the power of the God of Israel, not only that he is God,
but that he is God alone, and that indeed there is no God in all the
earth but in Israel ([Kg2 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#015).md) - a
noble confession, but such as intimates the misery of the Gentile world;
for the nations that had many gods really had no God, but were without
God in the world. He had formerly thought the gods of Syria gods indeed,
but now experience had rectified his mistake, and he knew Israel's God
was God alone, the sovereign Lord of all. Had he seen other lepers
cleansed, perhaps the sight would not have convinced him, but the mercy
of the cure affected him more than the miracle of it. Those are best
able to speak of the power of divine grace who have themselves
experienced it.

II\. Grateful to Elisha the prophet: "Therefore, for his sake whose
servant thou art, I have a present for thee, silver, and gold, and
raiment, whatever thou wilt please to accept." He valued the cure, not
by the easiness of it to the prophet, but the acceptableness of it to
himself, and would gladly pay for it accordingly. But Elisha generously
refused the fee, though urged to accept it; and, to prevent further
importunity, backed his refusal with an oath: As the Lord liveth, I will
receive none ([Kg2 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#016).md), not because
he did not need it, for he was poor enough, and knew what to do with it,
and how to bestow it among the sons of the prophets, nor because he
thought it unlawful, for he received presents from others; but he would
not be beholden to this Syrian, nor should he say, I have made Elisha
rich, [Gen 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#023.md). It would be much for
the honour of God to show this new convert that the servants of the God
of Israel were taught to look upon the wealth of this world with a holy
contempt, which would confirm him in his belief that there was no God
but in Israel. See [Co1 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#018.md); [Co2
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009.md).

III\. Proselyted to the worship of the God of Israel. He will not only
offer a sacrifice to the Lord, in thanks for his present cure, but he
resolves he will never offer sacrifice to any other gods, [Kg2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#017.md). It was a happy cure of his
leprosy which cured him of his idolatry, a more dangerous disease. But
here are two instances of his weakness and infirmity in his conversion:
- 1. In one instance he over-did it, that he would not only worship the
God of Israel, but he would have clods of earth out of the prophet's
garden, or at least of the prophet's ordering, to make an altar of, [Kg2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#017.md). He that awhile ago had spoken
very slightly of the waters of Israel ([Kg2
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#012).md) now is in another extreme, and
over-values the earth of Israel, supposing (since God has appointed
altars of earth, [Exo 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#024).md) that an
altar of that earth would be most acceptable to him, not considering
that all the earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof. Or perhaps the
transport of his affection and veneration for the prophet, not only upon
the account of his power, but of his virtue and generosity, made him, as
we say, love the very ground he went upon and desire to have some of it
home with him. The modern compliment equivalent to this would be, "Pray,
sir, let me have your picture." 2. In another instance he under-did it,
that he reserved to himself a liberty to bow in the house of Rimmon, in
complaisance to the king his master, and according to the duty of his
place at court ([Kg2 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#018).md), in this
thing he must be excused. He owns he ought not to do it, but that he
cannot otherwise not do it, but that he cannot otherwise keep his place,
- protests that his bowing is not, nor ever shall be, as it had been, in
honour to the idol, but only in honour to the king, - and therefore he
hopes God will forgive him. Perhaps, all things considered, this might
admit of some apology, though it was not justifiable. But, as to us, I
am sure, (1.) If, in covenanting with God, we make a reservation for any
known sin, which we will continue to indulge ourselves in, that
reservation is a defeasance of his covenant. We must cast away all our
transgressions and not except any house of Rimmon. (2.) Though we are
encouraged to pray for the remission of the sins we have committed, yet,
if we ask for a dispensation to go on in any sin for the future, we mock
God, and deceive ourselves. (3.) Those that know not how to quit a place
at court when they cannot keep it without sinning against God, and
wronging their consciences, do not rightly value the divine favour. (4.)
Those that truly hate evil will make conscience of abstaining from all
appearances of evil. Though Naaman's dissembling his religion cannot be
approved, yet because his promise to offer no sacrifice to any god but
the God of Israel only was a great point gained with a Syrian, and
because, by asking pardon in this matter, he showed such a degree of
conviction and ingenuousness as gave hopes of improvement, the prophet
took fair leave of him, and bade him Go in peace, [Kg2
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#019.md). Young converts must be tenderly
dealt with.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 5:20</span></span>

Naaman, a Syrian, a courtier, a soldier, had many servants, and we read
how wise and good they were, [Kg2
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#013.md). Elisha, a holy prophet, a man of
God, has but one servant, and he proves a base, lying, naughty fellow.
Those that heard of Elisha at a distance honoured him, and got good by
what they heard; but he that stood continually before him, to hear his
wisdom, had no good impressions made upon him either by his doctrine or
miracles. One would have expected that Elisha's servant should be a
saint (even Ahab's servant, Obadiah, was), but even Christ himself had a
Judas among his followers. The means of grace cannot give grace. The
best men, the best ministers have often had those about them that have
been their grief and shame. The nearer the church the further from God.
Many come from the east and west to sit down with Abraham when the
children of the kingdom shall be cast out. Here is,

I. Gehazi's sin. It was a complicated sin. 1. The love of money, that
root of all evil, was at the bottom of it. His master contemned Naaman's
treasures, but he coveted them, [Kg2
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#020). His heart (says bishop Hall.md) was
packed up in Naaman's chests, and he must run after him to fetch it.
Multitudes, by coveting worldly wealth, have erred from the faith and
pierced themselves with many sorrows. 2. He blamed his master for
refusing Naaman's present, condemned him as foolish in not taking gold
when he might have it, envied and grudged his kindness and generosity to
this stranger, though it was for the good of his soul. In short, he
thought himself wiser than his master. 3. When Naaman, like a person of
accomplished manners, alighted from his chariot to meet him ([Kg2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#021).md), he told him a deliberate lie,
that his master sent him to him, and so he received that courtesy to
himself that Naaman intended to his master. 4. He abused his master, and
basely misrepresented him to Naaman as one that had soon repented of his
generosity, that was fickle, and did not know his own mind, that would
say and unsay, swear and unswear, that would not do an honourable thing
but he must presently undo it again. his story of the two sons of the
prophets was as silly as it was false; if he would have begged a token
for two young scholars, surely less than a talent of silver might serve
them. 5. There was danger of his alienating Naaman from that holy
religion which he had espoused, and lessening his good opinion of it. he
would be ready to say, as Paul's enemies suggested concerning him ([Co2
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#016.md), [Co2
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#017).md), that, though Elisha himself
did not burden him, yet being crafty he caught him with guile, sending
those that made a gain of him. We hope that he understood afterwards
that Elisha's hand was not in it, and that Gehazi was forced to restore
what he had unjustly got, else it might have driven him to his idols
again. 6. His seeking to conceal what he had unjustly got added much to
his sin. (1.) He hid it, as Achan did his gain, by sacrilege, in the
tower, a secret place, a strong place, till he should have an
opportunity of laying it out, [Kg2
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#024.md). Now he thought himself sure of
it, and applauded his own management of a fraud by which he had imposed,
not only upon the prudence of Naaman, but upon Elisha's spirit of
discerning, as Ananias and Sapphira upon the apostles. (2.) He denied
it: He went in, and stood before his master, ready to receive his
orders. None looked more observant of his master, though really none
more injurious to him; he thought, as Ephraim, I have become rich, but
they shall find no iniquity in me, [Hos
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#008.md). His master asked him where he
had been, "Nowhere, sir" (said he), "out of the house." Note, One lie
commonly begets another: the way of that sin is down-hill; therefore
dare to be true.

II\. The punishment of this sin. Elisha immediately called him to an
account for it; and observe,

1\. How he was convicted. he thought to impose upon the prophet, but was
soon given to understand that the Spirit of prophecy could not be
deceived, and that it was in vain to lie to the Holy Ghost. Elisha could
tell him, (1.) What he had done, though he had denied it. "Thou sayest
thou wentest nowhere, but went not my heart with thee?" [Kg2
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#026.md). Had Gehazi yet to learn that
prophets had spiritual eyes? or could he think to hide any thing from a
seer, from him with whom the secret of the Lord was? Note, It is folly
to presume upon sin in hopes of secresy. When thou goest aside into any
by-path does not thy own conscience go with thee? Does not the eye of
God go with thee? He that covers his sin shall not prosper, particularly
a lying tongue is but for a moment, [Pro
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#019.md). Truth will transpire, and often
comes to light strangely, to the confusion of those that make lies their
refuge. (2.) What he designed, though he kept that in his own breast. He
could tell him the very thoughts and intents of his heart, that he was
projecting, now that he had got these two talents, to purchase ground
and cattle, to leave Elisha's service, and to set up for himself. Note,
All the foolish hopes and contrivances of carnal worldlings are open
before God. And he tells him also the evil of it: "Is it a time to
receive money? Is this an opportunity of enriching thyself? Couldst thou
find no better way of getting money than by belying thy master and
laying a stumbling-block before a young convert?" Note, Those that are
for getting wealth at any time, and by any ways and means whatsoever,
right or wrong, lay themselves open to a great deal of temptation. Those
that will be rich (per fas, per nefas; rem, rem, quocunque modo rem - by
fair means, by foul means; careless of principle, intent only on money)
drown themselves in destruction and perdition, [Ti1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009.md). War, and fire, and plague, and
shipwreck, are not, as many make them, things to get money by. It is not
a time to increase our wealth when we cannot do it but in such ways as
are dishonourable to God and religion or injurious to our brethren or
the public.

2\. How he was punished for it: The leprosy of Naaman shall cleave to
thee, [Kg2 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#027.md). If he will have his
money, he shall take his disease with it, Transit cum onere - It passes
with this incumbrance. He was contriving to entail lands upon his
posterity; but, instead of them, he entails a loathsome disease on the
heirs of his body, from generation to generation. The sentence was
immediately executed on himself; no sooner said than done: He went out
from his presence a leper as white as snow. Thus he is stigmatized and
made infamous, and carries the mark of his shame wherever he goes: thus
he loads himself and family with a curse, which shall not only for the
present proclaim his villany, but for ever perpetuate the remembrance of
it. Note, The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed
to and fro of those that seek death, [Pro
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#006.md). Those who get wealth by fraud
and injustice cannot expect either the comfort or the continuance of it.
What was Gehazi profited, though he gained his two talents, when thereby
he lost his health, his honour, his peace, his service, and, if
repentance prevented not, his soul for ever? See [Job
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#012.md), etc.
