### [Exodus Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 12:0</span></span>

This chapter gives an account of one of the most memorable ordinances,
and one of the most memorable providences, of all that are recorded in
the Old Testament. I. Not one of all the ordinances of the Jewish church
was more eminent than that of the passover, nor is any one more
frequently mentioned in the New Testament; and we have here an account
of the institution to it. The ordinance consisted of three parts: - 1.
The killing and eating of the paschal lamb ([Exo
12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#001.md), [Exo
12:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#008).md). 2. The sprinkling of the
blood upon the door-posts, spoken of as a distinct thing ([Heb
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#028).md), and peculiar to this first
passover ([Exo 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#007).md), with the reason
for it ([Exo 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#013).md). 3. The feast of
unleavened bread for seven days following; this points rather at what
was to be done afterwards, in the observance of this ordinance ([Exo
12:14-20](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#014).md). This institution is
communicated to the people, and they are instructed in the observance,
(1.) Of this first passover ([Exo
12:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#021)). (2..md) Of the after passovers
([Exo 12:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#024).md). And the Israelites'
obedience to these orders ([Exo
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#028).md). II. Not one of all the
providences of God concerning the Jewish church was more illustrious, or
is more frequently mentioned, than the deliverance of the children of
Israel out of Egypt. 1. The firstborn of the Egyptians are slain ([Exo
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#029.md), [Exo
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#030).md). 2. Orders are given
immediately for their discharge ([Exo
12:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#031).md). 3. They begin their march.
(1.) Loaded with their own effects ([Exo
12:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#034)). (2..md) Enriched with the spoils
of Egypt ([Exo 12:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#035.md), [Exo
12:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#036)). (3..md) Attended with a mixed
multitude ([Exo 12:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#037.md), [Exo
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#038)). (4..md) Put to their shifts for
present supply ([Exo 12:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#039).md). The event
is dated ([Exo 12:40-42](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#040).md). Lastly, A
recapitulation in the close, \[1.\] Of this memorable ordinance, with
some additions ([Exo 12:43-49](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#043).md). \[2.\]
Of this memorable providence ([Exo
12:50](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#050.md), [Exo
12:51](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#051).md).

[Exodus 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 12:1</span></span>

Moses and Aaron here receive of the Lord what they were afterwards to
deliver to the people concerning the ordinance of the passover, to which
is prefixed an order for a new style to be observed in their months
([Exo 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#001.md), [Exo
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#002).md): This shall be to you the
beginning of months. They had hitherto begun their year from the middle
of September, but henceforward they were to begin it from the middle of
March, at least in all their ecclesiastical computations. Note, It is
good to begin the day, and begin the year, and especially to begin our
lives, with God. This new calculation began the year with the spring,
which reneweth the face of the earth, and was used as a figure of the
coming of Christ, [Sol 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#011.md), [Sol
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#012.md). We may suppose that, while Moses
was bringing the ten plagues upon the Egyptians, he was directing the
Israelites to prepare for their departure at an hour's warning. Probably
he had be degrees brought them near together from their dispersions, for
their are here called the congregation of Israel ([Exo
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#003).md), and to them as a congregation
orders are here sent. Their amazement and hurry, it is easy to suppose,
were great; yet now they must apply themselves to the observance of a
sacred rite, to the honour of God. Note, When our heads are fullest of
care, and our hands of business, yet we must not forget our religion,
nor suffer ourselves to be indisposed for acts of devotion.

I. God appointed that on the night wherein they were to go out of Egypt
they should, in each of their families, kill a lamb, or that two or
three families, if they were small, should join for a lamb. The lamb was
to be got ready four days before and that afternoon they were to kill it
([Exo 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006).md) as a sacrifice; not
strictly, for it was not offered upon the altar, but as a religious
ceremony, acknowledging God's goodness to them, not only in preserving
them from, but in delivering them by, the plagues inflicted on the
Egyptians. See the antiquity of family-religion; and see the convenience
of the joining of small families together for religious worship, that it
may be made the more solemn.

II\. The lamb so slain they were to eat, roasted (we may suppose, in its
several quarters), with unleavened bread and bitter herbs, because they
were to eat it in haste ([Exo 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#011).md),
and to leave none of it until the morning; for God would have them to
depend upon him for their daily bread, and not to take thought for the
morrow. He that led them would feed them.

III\. Before they ate the flesh of the lamb, they were to sprinkle the
blood upon the doorposts, [Exo 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#007.md).
By this their houses were to be distinguished from the houses of the
Egyptians, and so their first-born secured from the sword of the
destroying angel, [Exo 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#012.md), [Exo
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#013.md). Dreadful work was to be made
this night in Egypt; all the first-born both of man and beast were to be
slain, and judgment executed upon the gods of Egypt. Moses does not
mention the fulfillment, in this chapter, yet he speaks of it [Num
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#004.md). It is very probable that the
idols which the Egyptians worshipped were destroyed, those of metal
melted, those of wood consumed, and those of stone broken to pieces,
whence Jethro infers ([Exo 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#011).md), The
Lord is greater than all gods. The same angel that destroyed their
first-born demolished their idols, which were no less dear to them. For
the protection of Israel from this plague they were ordered to sprinkle
the blood of the lamb upon the door-posts, their doing which would be
accepted as an instance of their faith in the divine warnings and their
obedience to the divine precepts. Note, 1. If in times of common
calamity God will secure his own people, and set a mark upon them; they
shall be hidden either in heaven or under heaven, preserved either from
the stroke of judgments or at least from the sting of them. 2. The blood
of sprinkling is the saint's security in times of common calamity; it is
this that marks them for God, pacifies conscience, and gives them
boldness of access to the throne of grace, and so becomes a wall of
protection round them and a wall of partition between them and the
children of this world.

IV\. This was to be annually observed as a feast of the Lord in their
generations, to which the feast of unleavened bread was annexed, during
which, for seven days, they were to eat no bread but what was
unleavened, in remembrance of their being confined to such bread, of
necessity, for many days after they came out of Egypt, [Exo
12:14-20](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#014.md). The appointment is
inculcated for their better direction, and that they might not mistake
concerning it, and to awaken those who perhaps in Egypt had grown
generally very stupid and careless in the matters of religion to a
diligent observance of the institution. Now, without doubt, there was
much of the gospel in this ordinance; it is often referred to in the New
Testament, and, in it, to us is the gospel preached, and not to them
only, who could not stedfastly look to the end of these things, [Heb
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#002.md); [Co2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#013.md).

1\. The paschal lamb was typical. Christ is our Passover, [Co1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007). (1..md) It was to be a lamb; and
Christ is the Lamb of God ([Joh 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029).md),
often in the Revelation called the Lamb, meek and innocent as a lamb,
dumb before the shearers, before the butchers. (2.) It was to be a male
of the first year ([Exo 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#005).md), in its
prime; Christ offered up himself in the midst of his days, not in
infancy with the babes of Bethlehem. It denotes the strength and
sufficiency of the Lord Jesus, on whom our help was laid. (3.) It was to
be without blemish ([Exo 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#005).md),
denoting the purity of the Lord Jesus, a Lamb without spot, [Pe1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019.md). The judge that condemned him (as
if his trial were only like the scrutiny that was made concerning the
sacrifices, whether they were without blemish or no) pronounced him
innocent. (4.) It was to be set apart four days before ([Exo
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#003.md), [Exo
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006).md), denoting the designation of the
Lord Jesus to be a Saviour, both in the purpose and in the promise. It
is very observable that as Christ was crucified at the passover, so he
solemnly entered into Jerusalem four days before, the very day that the
paschal lamb was set apart. (5.) It was to be slain, and roasted with
fire ([Exo 12:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006).md), denoting the
exquisite sufferings of the Lord Jesus, even unto death, the death of
the cross. The wrath of God is as fire, and Christ was made a curse for
us. (6.) It was to be killed by the whole congregation between the two
evenings, that is, between three o'clock and six. Christ suffered in the
end of the world ([Heb 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026).md), by the
hand of the Jews, the whole multitude of them ([Luk
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#018).md), and for the good of all his
spiritual Israel. (7.) Not a bone of it must be broken ([Exo
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#046).md), which is expressly said to be
fulfilled in Christ ([Joh 19:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#033.md), [Joh
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#036).md), denoting the unbroken strength
of the Lord Jesus.

2\. The sprinkling of the blood was typical. (1.) It was not enough that
the blood of the lamb was shed, but it must be sprinkled, denoting the
application of the merits of Christ's death to our souls; we must
receive the atonement, [Rom 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#011). (2..md)
It was to be sprinkled with a bunch of hyssop ([Exo
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#022).md) dipped in the basin. The
everlasting covenant, like the basin, in the conservatory of this blood,
the benefits and privileges purchased by it are laid up for us there;
faith is the bunch of hyssop by which we apply the promises to ourselves
and the benefits of the blood of Christ laid up in them. (3.) It was to
be sprinkled upon the door-posts, denoting the open profession we are to
make of faith in Christ, and obedience to him, as those that are not
ashamed to own our dependence upon him. The mark of the beast may be
received on the forehead or in the right hand, but the seal of the Lamb
is always in the forehead, [Rev 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#003.md).
There is a back-way to hell, but no back-way to heaven; no, the only way
to this is a high-way, [Isa 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#008). (4..md)
It was to be sprinkled upon the lintel and the sideposts, but not upon
the threshold ([Exo 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#007).md), which
cautions us to take heed of trampling under foot the blood of the
covenant, [Heb 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029.md). It is precious
blood, and must be precious to us. (5.) The blood, thus sprinkled, was a
means of the preservation of the Israelites from the destroying angel,
who had nothing to do where the blood was. If the blood of Christ be
sprinkled upon our consciences, it will be our protection from the wrath
of God, the curse of the law, and the damnation of hell, [Rom
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001.md).

3\. The solemnly eating of the lamb was typical of our gospel-duty to
Christ. (1.) The paschal lamb was killed, not to be looked upon only,
but to be fed upon; so we must by faith make Christ ours, as we do that
which we eat, and we must receive spiritual strength and nourishment
from him, as from our food, and have delight and satisfaction in him, as
we have in eating and drinking when we are hungry or thirsty: see [Joh
6:53-55](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#053). (2..md) It was to be all eaten;
those that by faith feed upon Christ must feed upon a whole Christ; they
must take Christ and his yoke, Christ and his cross, as well as Christ
and his crown. Is Christ divided? Those hat gather much of Christ will
have nothing over. (3.) It was to be eaten immediately, not deferred
till morning, [Exo 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#010.md). Today Christ
is offered, and is to be accepted while it is called today, before we
sleep the sleep of death. (4.) It was to be eaten with bitter herbs
([Exo 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#008).md), in remembrance of the
bitterness of their bondage in Egypt. We must feed upon Christ with
sorrow and brokenness of heart, in remembrance of sin; this will give an
admirable relish to the paschal lamb. Christ will be sweet to us if sin
be bitter. (5.) It was to be eaten in a departing posture ([Exo
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#011).md); when we feed upon Christ by
faith we must absolutely forsake the rule and dominion of sin, shake off
Pharaoh's yoke; and we must sit loose to the world, and every thing in
it, forsake all for Christ, and reckon it no bad bargain, [Heb
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#013.md), [Heb
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#014.md).

4\. The feast of unleavened bread was typical of the Christian life,
[Co1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007.md), [Co1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#008.md). Having received Christ Jesus the
Lord, (1.) We must keep a feast in holy joy, continually delighting
ourselves in Christ Jesus; no manner of work must be done ([Exo
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#016).md), no care admitted or indulged,
inconsistent with, or prejudicial to, this holy joy: if true believers
have not a continual feast, it is their own fault. (2.) It must be a
feast of unleavened bread, kept in charity, without the leaven of
malice, and in sincerity, without the leaven of hypocrisy. The law was
very strict as to the passover, and the Jews were so in their usages,
that no leaven should be found in their houses, [Exo
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#019.md). All the old leaven of sin must
be put far from us, with the utmost caution and abhorrence, if we would
keep the feast of a holy life to the honour of Christ. (3.) It was by an
ordinance for ever ([Exo 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#017).md); as
long as we live, we must continue feeding upon Christ and rejoicing in
him, always making thankful mention of the great things he has done for
us.

[Exodus 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 12:21</span></span>

I. Moses is here, as a faithful steward in God's house, teaching the
children of Israel to observe all things which God had commanded him;
and no doubt he gave the instructions as largely as he received them,
though they are not so largely recorded. It is here added,

1\. That this night, when the first-born were to be destroyed, no
Israelite must stir out of doors till morning, that is, till towards
morning, when they would be called to march out of Egypt, [Exo
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#022.md). Not but that the destroying
angel could have known an Israelite from an Egyptian in the street; but
God would intimate to them that their safety was owing to the blood of
sprinkling; if they put themselves from under the protection of that, it
was at their peril. Those whom God has marked for himself must not
mingle with evil doers: see [Isa
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020.md), [Isa
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#021.md). They must not go out of the
doors, lest they should straggle and be out of the way when they should
be summoned to depart: they must stay within, to wait for the salvation
of the Lord, and it is good to do so.

2\. That hereafter they should carefully teach their children the
meaning of this service, [Exo 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#026.md),
[Exo 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#027.md). Observe,

(1.) The question which the children would ask concerning this solemnity
(which they would soon take notice of in the family): "What mean you by
this service? What is he meaning of all this care and exactness about
eating this lamb, and this unleavened bread, more than about common
food? Why such a difference between this meal and other meals?" Note,
\[1.\] It is a good thing to see children inquisitive about the things
of God; it is to be hoped that those who are careful to ask for the way
will find it. Christ himself, when a child, heard and asked questions,
[Luk 2:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#046.md). \[2.\] It concerns us all
rightly to understand the meaning of those holy ordinances wherein we
worship God, what is the nature and what the end of them, what is
signified and what intended, what is the duty expected from us in them
and what are the advantages to be expected by us. Every ordinance has a
meaning; some ordinances, as sacraments, have not their meaning so plain
and obvious as others have; therefore we are concerned to search, that
we may not offer the blind for sacrifice, but may do a reasonable
service. If either we are ignorant of, or mistake about, the meaning of
holy ordinances, we can neither please God nor profit ourselves.

(2.) The answer which the parents were to return to this question ([Exo
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#027).md): You shall say, It is the
sacrifice of the Lord's passover, that is, "By the killing and
sacrificing of this lamb, we keep in remembrance the work of wonder and
grace which God did for our fathers, when," \[1.\] "To make way for our
deliverance out of bondage, he slew the firstborn of the Egyptians, so
compelling them to sign our discharge;" and, \[2.\] "Though there were
with us, even with us, sins against the Lord our God, for which the
destroying angel, when he was abroad doing execution, might justly have
destroyed our first-born too, yet God graciously appointed and accepted
the family-sacrifice of a lamb, instead of the first-born, as, of old,
the ram instead of Isaac, and in every house where the lamb was slain
the first-born were saved." The repetition of this solemnity in the
return of every year was designed, First, To look backward as a
memorial, that in it they might remember what great things God had done
for them and their fathers. The word pesach signifies a leap, or
transition; it is a passing over; for the destroying angel passed over
the houses of the Israelites, and did not destroy their first-born. When
God brings utter ruin upon his people he says, I will not pass by them
any more ([Amo 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#008.md); [Amo
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#002).md), intimating how often he had
passed by them, as now when the destroying angel passed over their
houses. Note, 1. Distinguishing mercies lay under peculiar obligations.
When a thousand fall at our side, and ten thousand at our right hand,
and yet we are preserved, and have our lives given us for a prey, this
should greatly affect us, [Psa 91:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#007.md).
In war or pestilence, if the arrow of death have passed by us, passed
over us, hit the next to us and just missed us, we must not say it was
by chance that we were preserved but by the special providence of our
God. 2. Old mercies to ourselves, or to our fathers, must not be
forgotten, but be had in everlasting remembrance, that God may be
praised, our faith in him encouraged, and our hearts enlarged in his
service. Secondly, It was designed to look forward as an earnest of the
great sacrifice of the Lamb of God in the fulness of time, instead of us
and our first-born. We were obnoxious to the sword of the destroying
angel, but Christ our passover was sacrificed for us, his death was our
life, and thus he was the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world,
from the foundation of the Jewish church: Moses kept the passover by
faith in Christ, for Christ was the end of the law for righteousness.

II\. The people received these instructions with reverence and ready
obedience. 1. They bowed the head and worshipped ([Exo
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#027).md): they hereby signified their
submission to this institution as a law, and their thankfulness for it
as a favour and privilege. Note, When God gives law to us, we must give
honour to him; when he speaks, we must bow our heads and worship. 2.
They went away and did as they were commanded, [Exo
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#023.md). Here was none of that
discontent and murmuring among them which we read of, [Exo
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#020.md), [Exo
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#021.md). The plagues of Egypt had done
them good, and raised their expectations of a glorious deliverance,
which before they despaired of; and now they went forth to meet it in
the way appointed. Note, The perfecting of God's mercies to us must be
waited for in a humble observance of his institutions.

[Exodus 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">exo 12:29</span></span>

Here we have, I. The Egyptians' sons, even their first-born, slain, [Exo
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#029.md), [Exo
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#030.md). If Pharaoh would have taken the
warning which was given him of this plague, and would thereupon have
released Israel, what a great many dear and valuable lives might have
been preserved! But see what obstinate infidelity brings upon men.
Observe, 1. The time when this blow was given: It was at midnight, which
added to the terror of it. The three preceding nights were made dreadful
by the additional plague of darkness, which might be felt, and doubtless
disturbed their repose; and now, when they hoped for one quiet night's
rest, at midnight was the alarm given. When the destroying angel drew
his sword against Jerusalem, it was in the day-time ([Sa2
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#015).md), which made it the less
frightful; but the destruction of Egypt was by a pestilence walking in
darkness, [Psa 91:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#006.md). Shortly there
will be an alarming cry at midnight, Behold, the bridegroom cometh. 2.
On whom the plague fastened - on their first-born, the joy and hope of
their respective families. They had slain the Hebrews' children, and now
God slew theirs. Thus he visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the
children; and he is not unrighteous who taketh vengeance. 3. How far it
reached - from the throne to the dungeon. Prince and peasant stand upon
the same level before God's judgments, for there is no respect of
persons with him; see [Job 34:29](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#029.md), [Job
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#020.md). Now the slain of the Lord were
many; multitudes, multitudes, fall in this valley of decision, when the
controversy between God and Pharaoh was to be determined. 4. What an
outcry was made upon it: There was a great cry in Egypt, universal
lamentation for their only son (with many), and with all for their
first-born. If any be suddenly taken ill in the night, we are wont to
call up neighbours; but the Egyptians could have no help, no comfort,
from their neighbours, all being involved in the same calamity. Let us
learn hence, (1.) To tremble before God, and to be afraid of his
judgments, [Psa 119:120](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#120.md). Who is able
to stand before him, or dares resist him? (2.) To be thankful to God for
the daily preservation of ourselves and our families: lying so much
exposed, we have reason to say, "It is of the Lord's mercies that we are
not consumed."

II\. God's sons, even his first-born, released; this judgment conquered
Pharaoh, and obliged him to surrender at discretion, without
capitulating. Men had better come up to God's terms at first, for he
will never come down to theirs, let them object as long as they will.
Now Pharaoh's pride is abased, and he yields to all that Moses had
insisted on: Serve the Lord as you have said ([Exo
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#031).md), and take your flocks as you
have said, [Exo 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#032.md). Note, God's
word will stand, and we shall get nothing by disputing it, or delaying
to submit to it. Hitherto the Israelites were not permitted to depart,
but now things had come to the last extremity, in consequence of which,
1. They are commanded to depart: Rise up, and get you forth, [Exo
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#031.md). Pharaoh had told Moses he
should see his face no more; but now he sent for him. Those will seek
God early in their distress who before had set him at defiance. Such a
fright he was now in that he gave orders by night for their discharge,
fearing lest, if he delayed any longer, he himself should fall next; and
that he sent them out, not as men hated (as the pagan historians have
represented this matter), but as men feared, is plainly discovered by
his humble request to them ([Exo
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#032).md): "Bless me also; let me have
your prayers, that I may not be plagued for what is past, when you are
gone." Note, Those that are enemies to God's church are enemies to
themselves, and, sooner or later, they will be made to see it. 2. They
are hired to depart by the Egyptians; they cried out ([Exo
12:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#033).md), We be all dead men. Note, When
death comes into our houses, it is seasonable for us to think of our own
mortality. Are our relations dead? It is easy to infer thence that we
are dying, and, in effect, already dead men. Upon this consideration
they were urgent with the Israelites to be gone, which gave great
advantage to the Israelites in borrowing their jewels, [Exo
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#035.md), [Exo
12:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#036.md). When the Egyptians urged them
to be gone, it was easy for the to say that the Egyptians had kept them
poor, that they could not undertake such a journey with empty purses,
but, that, if they would give them wherewithal to bear their charges,
they would be gone. And this the divine Providence designed in suffering
things to come to this extremity, that they, becoming formidable to the
Egyptians, might have what they would, for asking; the Lord also, by the
influence he has on the minds of people, inclined the hearts of the
Egyptians to furnish them with what they desired, they probably
intending thereby to make atonement, that the plagues might be stayed,
as the Philistines, when they returned the ark, sent a present with it
for a trespass-offering, having an eye to this precedent, [Sa1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#003.md), [Sa1
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#006.md). The Israelites might receive and
keep what they thus borrowed, or rather required, of the Egyptians, (1.)
As justly as servants receive wages from their masters for work done,
and sue for it if it be detained. (2.) As justly as conquerors take the
spoils of their enemies whom they have subdued; Pharaoh was in rebellion
against the God of the Hebrews, by which all that he had was forfeited.
(3.) As justly as subjects receive the estates granted to them by their
prince. God is the sovereign proprietor of the earth, and the fulness
thereof; and, if he take from one and give to another, who may say unto
him, What doest thou? It was by God's special order and appointment that
the Israelites did what they did, which was sufficient to justify them,
and bear them out; but what they did will by no means authorize others
(who cannot pretend to any such warrant) to do the same. Let us
remember, \[1.\] That the King of kings can do no wrong. \[2.\] That he
will do right to those whom men injure, [Psa
146:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#007.md). Hence it is that the wealth of
the sinner often proves to be laid up for the just, [Pro
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#022.md); [Job
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#016.md), [Job
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#017.md).

[Exodus 12:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">exo 12:37</span></span>

Here is the departure of the children of Israel out of Egypt; having
obtained their dismission, they set forward without delay, and did not
defer to a more convenient season. Pharaoh was now in a good mind; but
they had reason to think he would not long continue so, and therefore it
was no time to linger. We have here an account, 1. Of their number,
about 600,000 men ([Exo 12:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#037).md),
besides women and children, which I think, we cannot suppose to make
less than 1,200,000 more. What a vast increase was this, to arise from
seventy souls in little more than 200 years' time! See the power and
efficacy of that blessing, when God commands it, Be fruitful and
multiply. This was typical of the multitudes that were brought into the
gospel church when it was first founded; so mightily grew the word of
God, and prevailed. 2. Of their retinue ([Exo
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#038).md): A mixed multitude went up with
them, hangers on to that great family, some perhaps willing to leave
their country, because it was laid waste by the plagues, and to seek
their fortune, as we say, with the Israelites; others went out of
curiosity, to see the solemnities of Israel's sacrifice to their God,
which had been so much talked of, and expecting to see some glorious
appearances of their God to them in the wilderness, having seen such
glorious appearances of their God for them in the field of Zoan, [Psa
78:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#012.md). Probably the greatest part of
this mixed multitude were but a rude unthinking mob, that followed the
crowd they knew not why; we afterwards find that they proved a snare to
them ([Num 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#004).md), and it is probable
that when, soon afterwards, they understood that the children of Israel
were to continue forty years in the wilderness, they quitted them, and
returned to Egypt. Note, There were always those among the Israelites
that were not Israelites, and there are still hypocrites in the church,
who make a deal of mischief, but will be shaken off at last. 3. Of their
effects. They had with them flocks and herds, even very much cattle.
This is taken notice of because it was long before Pharaoh would give
them leave to remove their effects, which were chiefly cattle, [Gen
46:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#032.md). 4. Of the provision made for
the camp, which was very poor and slender. They brought some dough with
them out of Egypt in their knapsacks, [Exo
12:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#034.md). They had prepared to bake, the
next day, in order to their removal, understanding it was very near;
but, being hastened away sooner than they thought of, by some hours,
they took the dough as it was, unleavened; when they came to Succoth,
their first stage, they baked unleavened cakes, and, though these were
of course insipid, yet the liberty they were brought into made this the
most joyful meal they had ever eaten in their lives. Note, The servants
of God must not be slaves to their appetites, nor solicitous to wind up
all the delights of sense to their highest pitch. We should be willing
to take up with dry bread, nay, with unleavened bread, rather than
neglect or delay any service we have to do for God, as those whose meat
and drink it is to do his will. 5. Of the date of this great event: it
was just 430 years from the promise made to Abraham (as the apostle
explains it, [Gal 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#017).md) at his first
coming into Canaan, during all which time the children of Israel, that
is, the Hebrews, the distinguished chosen seed, were sojourners in a
land that was not theirs, either Canaan or Egypt. So long the promise
God made to Abraham of a settlement lay dormant and unfulfilled, but
now, at length, it revived, and things began to work towards the
accomplishment of it. The first day of the march of Abraham's seed
towards Canaan was just 430 years (it should seem to a day) from the
promise made to Abraham, [Gen 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002.md), I
will make of thee a great nation. See how punctual God is to his time;
though his promises be not performed quickly, they will be accomplished
in their season. 6. Of the memorableness of it: It is a night to be much
observed, [Exo 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#042). (1..md) The
providences of that first night were very observable; memorable was the
destruction of the Egyptians, and the deliverance of the Israelites by
it; God herein made himself taken notice of. (2.) The ordinances of that
night, in the annual return of it, were to be carefully observed: This
is that night of the Lord, that remarkable night, to be celebrated in
all generations. Note, The great things God does for his people are not
to be a nine days' wonder, as we say, but the remembrance of them is to
be perpetuated throughout all ages, especially the work of our
redemption by Christ. This first passover-night was a night of the Lord
much to be observed; but the last passover-night, in which Christ was
betrayed (and in which the passover, with the rest of the ceremonial
institutions, was superseded and abolished), was a night of the Lord
much more to be observed, when a yoke heavier than that of Egypt was
broken from off our necks, and a land better than that of Canaan set
before us. That was a temporal deliverance to be celebrated in their
generation; this is an eternal redemption to be celebrated in the
praises of glorious saints, world without end.

[Exodus 12:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">exo 12:43</span></span>

Some further precepts are here given concerning the passover, as it
should be observed in times to come.

I. All the congregation of Israel must keep it, [Exo
12:47](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#047.md). All that share in God's mercies
should join in thankful praises for them. Though it was observed in
families apart, yet it is looked upon as the act of the whole
congregation; for the smaller communities constituted the greater. The
New Testament passover, the Lord's supper, ought not to be neglected by
any who are capable of celebrating it. He is unworthy the name of an
Israelite that can contentedly neglect the commemoration of so great a
deliverance. 1. No stranger that was uncircumcised might be admitted to
eat of it, [Exo 12:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#043.md), [Exo
12:45](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#045.md), [Exo
12:48](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#048.md). None might sit at the table but
those that came in by the door; nor may any now approach to the
improving ordinance of the Lord's supper who have not first submitted to
the initiating ordinance of baptism. We must be born again by the word
ere we can be nourished by it. Nor shall any partake of the benefit of
Christ's sacrifice, or feast upon it, who are not first circumcised in
heart, [Col 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011.md). 2. Any stranger that
was circumcised might be welcome to eat of the passover, even servants,
[Exo 12:44](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#044.md). If, by circumcision, they
would make themselves debtors to the law in its burdens, they were
welcome to share in the joy of its solemn feasts, and not otherwise.
Only it is intimated ([Exo 12:48](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#048).md) that
those who were masters of families must not only be circumcised
themselves, but have all their males circumcised too. If in sincerity,
and with that zeal which the thing required and deserves, we give up
ourselves to God, we shall, with ourselves, give up all we have to him,
and do our utmost that all ours may be his too. Here is an early
indication of favour to the poor Gentiles, that the stranger, if
circumcised, stands upon the same level with the home-born Israelite.
One law for both, [Exo 12:49](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#049.md). This was
a mortification to the Jews, and taught them that it was their
dedication to God, not their descent from Abraham, that entitled them to
their privileges. A sincere proselyte was as welcome to the passover as
a native Israelite, [Isa 56:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#006.md), [Isa
56:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#007.md).

II\. In one house shall it be eaten ([Exo
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#046).md), for good-fellowship sake, that
they might rejoice together, and edify one another in the eating of it.
None of it must be carried to another place, nor left to another time;
for God would not have them so taken up with care about their departure
as to be indisposed to take the comfort of it, but to leave Egypt, and
enter upon a wilderness, with cheerfulness, and, in token of that, to
eat a good hearty meal. The papists' carrying their consecrated host
from house to house is not only superstitious in itself, but contrary to
this typical law of the passover, which directed that no part of the
lamb should be carried abroad.

The chapter concludes with a repetition of the whole matter, that the
children of Israel did as they were bidden, and God did for them as he
promised ([Exo 12:50](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#050.md), [Exo
12:51](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#051).md); for he will certainly be the
author of salvation to those that obey him.
