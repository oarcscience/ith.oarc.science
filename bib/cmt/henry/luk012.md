### [Luke Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001.md)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 12:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have divers excellent discourses of our Saviour's
upon various occasions, many of which are to the same purport with what
we had in Matthew upon other the like occasions; for we may suppose that
our Lord Jesus preached the same doctrines, and pressed the same duties,
at several times, in several companies, and that one of the evangelists
took them as he delivered them at one time and another at another time;
and we need thus to have precept upon precept, line upon line. Here, I.
Christ warns his disciples to take heed of hypocrisy, and of cowardice
in professing Christianity and preaching the gospel ([Luk
12:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001).md). II. He gives a caution
against covetousness, upon occasion of a covetous motion made to him,
and illustrates that caution by a parable of a rich man suddenly cut off
by death in the midst of his worldly projects and hopes ([Luk
12:13-21](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#013).md). III. He encourages his
disciples to cast all their care upon God, and to live easy in a
dependence upon his providence, and exhorts them to make religion their
main business ([Luk 12:22-34](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#022).md). IV. He
stirs them up to watchfulness for their Master's coming, from the
consideration of the reward of those who are then found faithful, and
the punishment of those who are found unfaithful ([Luk
12:35-48](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#035).md). V. He bids them expect
trouble and persecution ([Luk
12:49-53](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#049).md). VI. He warns the people to
observe and improve the day of their opportunities and to make their
peace with God in time ([Luk
12:54-59](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#054).md).

[Luke 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 12:1</span></span>

We find here, I. A vast auditory that was got together to hear Christ
preach. The scribes and Pharisees sought to accuse him, and do him
mischief; but the people, who were not under the bias of their
prejudices and jealousies, still admired him, attended on him, and did
him honour. In the mean time ([Luk
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001).md), while he was in the Pharisee's
house, contending with them that sought to ensnare him, the people got
together for an afternoon sermon, a sermon after dinner, after dinner
with a Pharisee; and he would not disappoint them. Though in the morning
sermon, when they were gathered thickly together ([Luk
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#029).md), he had severely reproved them,
as an evil generation that seek a sign, yet they renewed their
attendance on him; so much better could the people bear their reproofs
than the Pharisees theirs. The more the Pharisees strove to drive the
people from Christ, the more flocking there was to him. Here was an
innumerable multitude of people gathered together, so that they trade
one upon another, in labouring to get foremost, and to come within
hearing. It is a good sight to see people thus forward to hear the word,
and venture upon inconvenience and danger rather than miss an
opportunity for their souls. Who are these that thus fly as the doves to
their windows? [Isa 60:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#008.md). When the net
is cast where there is such a multitude of fish, it may be hoped that
some will be enclosed.

II\. The instructions which he gave his followers, in the hearing of
this auditory.

1\. He began with a caution against hypocrisy. This he said to his
disciples first of all; either to the twelve, or to the seventy. These
were his more peculiar charge, his family, his school, and therefore he
particularly warned them as his beloved sons; they made more profession
of religion than others and hypocrisy in that was the sin they were most
in danger of. They were to preach to others; and, if they should
prevaricate, corrupt the word, and deal deceitfully, hypocrisy would be
worse in them than in others. Besides, there was a Judas among them, who
was a hypocrite, and Christ knew it, and would hereby startle him, or
leave him inexcusable. Christ's disciples were, for aught we know, the
best men then in the world, yet they needed to be cautioned against
hypocrisy. Christ said this to the disciples, in the hearing of this
great multitude, rather than privately when he had them by themselves,
to add the greater weight to the caution, and to let the world know that
he would not countenance hypocrisy, no, not in his own disciples. Now
observe,

(1.) The description of that sin which he warns them against: It is the
leaven of the Pharisees. \[1.\] It is leaven; it is spreading as leaven,
insinuates itself into the whole man, and all that he does; it is
swelling and souring as leaven, for it puffs men up with pride,
embitters them with malice, and makes their service unacceptable to God.
\[2.\] It is the leaven of the Pharisees: "It is the sin they are most
of them found in. Take heed of imitating them; be not you of their
spirit; do not dissemble in Christianity as they do in Judaism; make not
your religion a cloak of maliciousness, as they do theirs."

(2.) A good reason against it: "For there is nothing covered that shall
not be revealed, [Luk 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#002.md), [Luk
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#003.md). It is to no purpose to
dissemble, for, sooner or later, truth will come out; and a lying tongue
is but for a moment. If you speak in darkness that which is unbecoming
you, and is inconsistent with your public professions, it shall be heard
in the light; some way or other it shall be discovered, a bird of the
air shall carry the voice ([Ecc
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#020).md), and your folly and falsehood
will be made manifest." The iniquity that is concealed with a show of
piety will be discovered, perhaps in this world, as Judas's was, and
Simon Magus's, at furthest in the great day, when the secrets of all
hearts shall be made manifest, [Ecc
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#014.md); [Rom
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#016.md). If men's religion prevail not to
conquer and cure the wickedness of their hearts, it shall not always
serve for a cloak. The day is coming when hypocrites will be stripped of
their fig-leaves.

2\. To this he added a charge to them to be faithful to the trust
reposed in them, and not to betray it, through cowardice or base fear.
Some make [Luk 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#002.md), [Luk
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#003.md), to be a caution to them not to
conceal those things which they had been instructed in, and were
employed to publish to the world. "Whether men will hear, or whether
they will forbear, tell them the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth; what has been spoken to you, and you have talked of among
yourselves, privately, and in corners, that do you preach publicly,
whoever is offended; for, if you please men, you are not Christ's
servants, nor can you please him," [Gal
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#010.md). But this was not the worst of
it: it was likely to be a suffering cause, though never a sinking one:
let them therefore arm themselves with courage; and divers arguments are
furnished here to steel them with a holy resolution in their work.
Consider,

(1.) "The power of your enemies is a limited power ([Luk
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#004).md): I say unto you, my friends"
(Christ's disciples are his friends, he calls them friends, and gives
them this friendly advice), "be not afraid, do not disquiet yourselves
with tormenting fears of the power and rage of men." Note, Those whom
Christ owns for his friends need not be afraid of any enemies. "Be not
afraid, no, not of them that kill the body, let it not be in the power
of scoffers, not even of murderers, to drive you off from your work, for
you that have learned to triumph over death may say, even of them, Let
them do their worst, after that there is no more that they can do; the
immortal soul lives, and is happy, and enjoys itself and its God, and
sets them all at defiance." Note, Those can do Christ's disciples no
real harm, and therefore ought not to be dreaded, who can but kill the
body; for they only send that to its rest, and the soul to its joy, the
sooner.

(2.) God is to be feared more than the most powerful men: "I will
forewarn you whom you shall fear ([Luk
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#005).md): that you may fear man less,
fear God more. Moses conquers his fear of the wrath of the king, by
having an eye to him that is invisible. By owning Christ you may incur
the wrath of men, which can reach no further than to put you to death
(and without God's permission they cannot do that); but by denying
Christ, and disowning him, you will incur the wrath of God, which has
power to send you to hell, and there is no resisting it. Now of two
evils the less is to be chosen, and the greater is to be dreaded, and
therefore I say unto you, Fear him." "It is true," said that blessed
martyr, Bishop Hooper, "life is sweet, and death bitter; but eternal
life is more sweet, and eternal death more bitter."

(3.) The lives of good Christians and good ministers are the particular
care of divine Providence, [Luk 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#006.md),
[Luk 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#007.md). To encourage us in times of
difficulty and danger, we must have recourse to our first principles,
and build upon them. Now a firm belief of the doctrine of God's
universal providence, and the extent of it, will be satisfying to us
when at any time we are in peril, and will encourage us to trust God in
the way of duty. \[1.\] Providence takes cognizance of the meanest
creatures, even of the sparrows. "Though they are of such small account
that five of them are sold for two farthings, yet not one of them is
forgotten of God, but is provided for, and notice is taken of its death.
Now, you are of more value than many sparrows, and therefore you may be
sure you are not forgotten, though imprisoned, though banished, though
forgotten by your friends; much more precious in the sight of the Lord
is the death of saints than the death of sparrows." \[2.\] Providence
takes cognizance of the meanest interest of the disciples of Christ:
"Even the very hairs of your head are all numbered ([Luk
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#007).md); much more are your sighs and
tears numbered, and the drops of your blood, which you shed for Christ's
name's sake. An account is kept of all your losses, that they may be,
and without doubt they shall be, recompensed unspeakably to your
advantage."

(4.) "You will be owned or disowned by Christ, in the great day,
according as you now own or disown him," [Luk
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#008.md), [Luk
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#009.md). \[1.\] To engage us to confess
Christ before men, whatever we may lose or suffer for our constancy to
him, and how dear soever it may cost us, we are assured that they who
confess Christ now shall be owned by him in the great day before the
angels of God, to their everlasting comfort and honour. Jesus Christ
will confess, not only that he suffered for them, and that they are to
have the benefit of his sufferings, but that they suffered for him, and
that his kingdom and interest on earth were advanced by their
sufferings; and what greater honour can be done them? \[2.\] To deter us
from denying Christ, and a cowardly deserting of his truths and ways, we
are here assured that those who deny Christ, and treacherously depart
from him, whatever they may save by it, though it were life itself, and
whatever they may gain by it, though it were a kingdom, will be vast
losers at last, for they shall be denied before the angels of God;
Christ will not know them, will not own them, will not show them any
favour, which will turn to their everlasting terror and contempt. By the
stress here laid upon their being confessed or denied before the angels
of God, it should seem to be a considerable part of the happiness of
glorified saints that they will not only stand right, but stand high, in
the esteem of the holy angels; they will love them, and honour them, and
own them, if they be Christ's servants; they are their fellow-servants,
and they will take them for their companions. On the contrary, a
considerable part of the misery of damned sinners will be that the holy
angels will abandon them, and will be the pleased witnesses, not only of
their disgrace, as here, but of their misery, for they shall be
tormented in the presence of the holy angels ([Rev
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#010).md), who will give them no relief.

(5.) The errand they were shortly to be sent out upon was of the highest
and last importance to the children of men, to whom they were sent, [Luk
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#010.md). Let them be bold in preaching
the gospel, for a sorer and heavier doom would attend those that
rejected them (after the Spirit was poured upon them, which was to be
the last method of conviction) than those that now rejected Christ
himself, and opposed him: "Greater works than those shall he do, and,
consequently, greater will be the punishment of those that blaspheme the
gifts and operations of the Holy Ghost in you. Whosoever shall speak a
word against the Son of man, shall stumble at the meanness of his
appearance, and speak slightly and spitefully of him, it is capable of
some excuse: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. But
unto him that blasphemes the Holy Ghost, that blasphemes the Christian
doctrine, and maliciously opposes it, after the pouring out of the
Spirit and his attestation of Christ's being glorified ([Act
2:33](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#033.md); [Act
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#032).md), the privilege of the
forgiveness of sins shall be denied; he shall have no benefit by Christ
and his gospel. You may shake off the dust of your feet against those
that do so, and give them over as incurable; they have forfeited that
repentance and that remission which Christ was exalted to give, and
which you are commissioned to preach." The sin, no doubt, was the more
daring, and consequently the case the more desperate, during the
continuance of the extraordinary gifts and operations of the Spirit in
the church, which were intended for a sign to them who believed not,
[Co1 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#022.md). There were hopes of those
who, though not convinced by them at first, yet admired them, but those
who blasphemed them were given over.

(6.) Whatever trials they should be called out to, they should be
sufficiently furnished for them, and honourably brought through them,
[Luk 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#011.md), [Luk
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#012.md). The faithful martyr for Christ
has not only sufferings to undergo, but a testimony to bear, a good
confession to witness, and is concerned to do that well, so that the
cause of Christ may not suffer, though he suffer for it; and, if this be
his care, let him cast it upon God: "When they bring you into the
synagogues, before church-rulers, before the Jewish courts, or before
magistrates and powers, Gentile rulers, rulers in the state, to be
examined about your doctrine, what it is, and what the proof of it, take
no thought what ye shall answer," \[1.\] "That you may save yourselves.
Do not study by what art or rhetoric to mollify your judges, or by what
tricks in law to bring yourselves off; if it be the will of God that you
should come off, and your time is not yet come, he will bring it about
effectually." \[2.\] "That you may serve your Master; aim at this, but
do not perplex yourselves about it, for the Holy Ghost, as a Spirit of
wisdom, shall teach you what you ought to say, and how to say it, so
that it may be for the honour of God and his cause."

[Luke 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 12:13</span></span>

We have in these verses,

I. The application that was made to Christ, very unseasonably, by one of
his hearers, desiring him to interpose between him and his brother in a
matter that concerned the estate of the family ([Luk
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#013).md): "Master, speak to my brother;
speak as a prophet, speak as a king, speak with authority; he is one
that will have regard to what thou sayest; speak to him, that he divide
the inheritance with me." Now, 1. Some think that his brother did him
wrong, and that he appealed to Christ to right him, because he knew the
law was costly. His brother was such a one as the Jews called
Ben-hamesen - a son of violence, that took not only his own part of the
estate, but his brother's too, and forcibly detained it from him. Such
brethren there are in the world, who have no sense at all either of
natural equity or natural affection, who make a prey of those whom they
ought to patronize and protect. They who are so wronged have God to go
to, who will execute judgment and justice for those that are oppressed.
2. Others think that he had a mind to do his brother wrong, and would
have Christ to assist him; that, whereas the law gave the elder brother
a double portion of the estate, and the father himself could not dispose
of what he had but by that rule ([Deu
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#016.md), [Deu
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#017).md), he would have Christ to alter
that law, and oblige his brother, who perhaps was a follower of Christ
at large, to divide the inheritance equally with him, in gavel-kind,
share and share alike, and to allot him as much as his elder brother. I
suspect that this was the case, because Christ takes occasion from it to
warn against covetousness, pleonexia - a desire of having more, more
than God in his providence has allotted us. It was not a lawful desire
of getting his own, but a sinful desire of getting more than his own.

II\. Christ's refusal to interpose in this matter ([Luk
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#014).md): Man, who made me a judge or
divider over you? In matters of this nature, Christ will not assume
either a legislative power to alter the settled rule of inheritances, or
a judicial power to determine controversies concerning them. He could
have done the judge's part, and the lawyer's, as well as he did the
physician's, and have ended suits at law as happily as he did diseases;
but he would not, for it was not in his commission: Who made me a judge?
Probably he refers to the indignity done to Moses by his brethren in
Egypt, with which Stephen upbraided the Jews, [Act
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#027.md), [Act
7:35](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#035.md). "If I should offer to do this,
you would taunt me as you did Moses, Who made thee a judge or a
divider?" He corrects the man's mistake, will not admit his appeal (it
was coram non judice - not before the proper judge), and so dismisses
his bill. If he had come to him to desire him to assist his pursuit of
the heavenly inheritance, Christ would have given him his best help; but
as to this matter he has nothing to do: Who made me a judge? Note, Jesus
Christ was no usurper; he took no honour, no power, to himself, but what
was given him, [Heb 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#005.md). Whatever he
did, he could tell by what authority he did it, and who gave him that
authority. Now this shows us what is the nature and constitution of
Christ's kingdom. It is a spiritual kingdom, and not of this world. 1.
It does not interfere with civil powers, nor take the authority of
princes out of their hands. Christianity leaves the matter as it found
it, as to civil power. 2. It does not intermeddle with civil rights; it
obliges all to do justly, according to the settled rules of equity, but
dominion is not founded in grace. 3. It does not encourage our
expectations of worldly advantages by our religion. If this man will be
a disciple of Christ, and expects that in consideration of this Christ
should give him his brother's estate, he is mistaken; the rewards of
Christ's disciples are of another nature. 4. It does not encourage our
contests with our brethren, and our being rigorous and high in our
demands, but rather, for peace' sake, to recede from our right. 5. It
does not allow ministers to entangle themselves in the affairs of this
life ([Ti2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#004).md), to leave the word of
God to serve tables. There are those whose business it is, let it be
left to them, Tractent fabrilia fabri - Each workman to his proper
craft.

III\. The necessary caution which Christ took occasion from this to give
to his hearers. Though he came not to be a divider of men's estates, he
came to be a director of their consciences about them, and would have
all take heed of harbouring that corrupt principle which they saw to be
in others the root of so much evil. Here is,

1\. The caution itself ([Luk 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#015).md):
Take heed and beware of covetousness; horate - "Observe yourselves, keep
a jealous eye upon your own hearts, lest covetous principles steal into
them; and phulassesthe - preserve yourselves, keep a strict band upon
your own hearts, lest covetous principles rule and give law in them."
Covetousness is a sin which we have need constantly to watch against,
and therefore frequently to be warned against.

2\. The reason of it, or an argument to enforce this caution: For a
man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he
possesseth; that is, "our happiness and comfort do not depend upon our
having a great deal of the wealth of this world." (1.) The life of the
soul, undoubtedly, does not depend upon it, and the soul is the man. The
things of the world will not suit the nature of a soul, nor supply its
needs, nor satisfy its desires, nor last so long as it will last. Nay,
(2.) Even the life of the body and the happiness of that do not consist
in an abundance of these things; for many live very contentedly and
easily, and get through the world very comfortably, who have but a
little of the wealth of it (a dinner of herbs with holy love is better
than a feast of fat things); and, on the other hand, many live very
miserably who have a great deal of the things of this world; they
possess abundance, and yet have no comfort of it; they bereave their
souls of good, [Ecc 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#008.md). Many who have
abundance are discontented and fretful, as Ahab and Haman; and then what
good does their abundance do them?

3\. The illustration of this by a parable, the sum of which is to show
the folly of carnal worldlings while they live, and their misery when
they die, which is intended not only for a check to that man who came to
Christ with an address about his estate, while he was in no care about
his soul and another world, but for the enforcing of that necessary
caution to us all, to take heed of covetousness. The parable gives us
the life and death of a rich man, and leaves us to judge whether he was
a happy man.

(1.) Here is an account of his worldly wealth and abundance ([Luk
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#016).md): The ground of a certain rich
man brought forth plentifully, chōra - regio - the country. He had a
whole country to himself, a lordship of his own; he was a little prince.
Observe, His wealth lay much in the fruits of the earth, for the king
himself is served by the field, [Ecc
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#009.md). He had a great deal of ground,
and his ground was fruitful; much would have more, and he had more.
Note, The fruitfulness of the earth is a great blessing, but it is a
blessing which God often gives plentifully to wicked men, to whom it is
a snare, that we may not think to judge of his love or hatred by what is
before us.

(2.) Here are the workings of his heart, in the midst of this abundance.
We are here told what he thought within himself, [Luk
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#017.md). Note, The God of heaven knows
and observes whatever we think within ourselves, and we are accountable
to him for it. He is both a discerner and judge of the thoughts and
intents of the heart. We mistake if we imagine that thoughts are hid and
thoughts are free. Let us here observe,

\[1.\] What his cares and concerns were. When he saw an extraordinary
crop upon his ground, instead of thanking God for it, or rejoicing in
the opportunity it would give him of doing the more good, he afflicts
himself with this thought, What shall I do, because I have no room where
to bestow my fruits? He speaks as one at a loss, and full of perplexity.
What shall I do now? The poorest beggar in the country, that did not
know where to get a meal's meat, could not have said a more anxious
word. Disquieting care is the common fruit of an abundance of this
world, and the common fault of those that have abundance. The more men
have, the more perplexity they have with it, and the more solicitous
they are to keep what they have and to add to it, how to spare and how
to spend; so that even the abundance of the rich will not suffer them to
sleep, for thinking what they shall do with what they have and how they
shall dispose of it. The rich man seems to speak it with a sigh, What
shall I do? And if you ask, Why, what is the matter? Truly he had
abundance of wealth, and wants a place to put it in, that is all.

\[2.\] What his projects and purposes were, which were the result of his
cares, and were indeed absurd and foolish like them ([Luk
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#018).md): "This will I do, and it is the
wisest course I can take, I will pull down my barns, for they are too
little, and I will build greater, and there will I bestow all my fruits
and my goods, and then I shall be at ease." Now here, First, It was
folly for him to call the fruits of the ground his fruits and his goods.
He seems to lay a pleasing emphasis upon that, my fruits and my goods;
whereas what we have is but lent us for our use, the property is still
in God; we are but stewards of our Lord's goods, tenants at will of our
Lord's land. It is my corn (saith God) and my wine, [Hos
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#008.md), [Hos
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#009.md). Secondly, It was folly for him to
hoard up what he had, and then to think it well bestowed. There will I
bestow it all; as if none must be bestowed upon the poor, none upon his
family, none upon the Levite and the stranger, the fatherless and the
widow, but all in the great barn. Thirdly, It was folly for him to let
his mind rise with his condition; when his ground brought forth more
plentifully than usual, then to talk of bigger barns, as if the next
year must needs be as fruitful as this, and much more abundant, whereas
the barn might be as much too big the next year as it was too little
this. Years of famine commonly follow years of plenty, as they did in
Egypt; and therefore it were better to stack some of his corn for this
once. Fourthly, It was folly for him to think to ease his care by
building new barns, for the building of them would but increase his
care; those know this who know any thing of the spirit of building. The
way that God prescribes for the cure of inordinate care is certainly
successful, but the way of the world does but increase it. Besides, when
he had done this, there were other cares that would still attend him;
the greater the barns, still the greater the cares, [Ecc
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#010.md). Fifthly, It was folly for him to
contrive and resolve all this absolutely and without reserve. This I
will do: I will pull down my barns and will build greater, yea, that I
will; without so much as that necessary proviso, If the Lord will, I
shall live, [Jam 4:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#013.md). Peremptory
projects are foolish projects; for our times are in God's hand, and not
in our own, and we do not so much as know what shall be on the morrow.

\[3.\] What his pleasing hopes and expectations were, when he should
have made good these projects. "Then I will say to my soul, upon the
credit of this security, whether God say it or no, Soul, mark what I
say, thou hast much goods laid up for many years in these barns; now
take thine ease, enjoy thyself, eat, drink, and be merry," [Luk
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#019.md). Here also appears his folly, as
much in the enjoyment of his wealth as in the pursuit of it. First, It
was folly for him to put off his comfort in his abundance till he had
compassed his projects concerning it. When he has built bigger barns,
and filled them (which will be a work of time), then he will take his
ease; and might he not as well have done that now? Grotius here quotes
the story of Pyrrhus, who was projecting to make himself master of
Sicily, Africa, and other places, in the prosecution of his victories.
Well, says his friend Cyneas, and what must we do then? Postea vivemus,
says he, Then we will live; At hoc jam licet, says Cyneas, We may live
now if we please. Secondly, It was folly for him to be confident that
his goods were laid up for many years, as if his bigger barns would be
safer than those he had; whereas in an hour's time they might be burnt
to the ground and all that was laid up in them, perhaps by lightning,
against which there is no defence. A few years may make a great change;
moth and rust may corrupt, or thieves break through and steal. Thirdly,
It was folly for him to count upon certain ease, when he had laid up
abundance of the wealth of this world, whereas there are many things
that may make people uneasy in the midst of their greatest abundance.
One dead fly may spoil a whole pot of precious ointment; and one thorn a
whole bed of down. Pain and sickness of body, disagreeableness of
relations, and especially a guilty conscience, may rob a man of his
ease, who has ever so much of the wealth of this world. Fourthly, It was
folly for him to think of making no other use of his plenty than to eat
and drink, and to be merry; to indulge the flesh, and gratify the
sensual appetite, without any thought of doing good to others, and being
put thereby into a better capacity of serving God and his generation: as
if we lived to eat, and did not eat to live, and the happiness of man
consisted in nothing else but in having all the gratifications of sense
wound up to the height of pleasurableness. Fifthly, It was the greatest
folly of all to say all this to his soul. if he had said, Body, take
thine ease, for thou hast goods laid up for many years, there had been
sense in it; but the soul, considered as an immortal spirit, separable
from the body, was no way interested in a barn full of corn or a bag
full of gold. If he had had the soul of a swine, he might have blessed
it with the satisfaction of eating and drinking; but what is this to the
soul of a man, that has exigencies and desires which these things will
be no ways suited to? It is the great absurdity which the children of
this world are guilty of that they portion their souls in the wealth of
the world and the pleasures of sense.

(3.) Here is God's sentence upon all this; and we are sure that his
judgment is according to truth. He said to himself, said to his soul,
Take thine ease. If God had said so too, the man had been happy, as his
Spirit witnesses with the spirit of believers to make them easy. But God
said quite otherwise; and by his judgment of us we must stand or fall,
not by ours of ourselves, [Co1 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#003.md),
[Co1 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#004.md). His neighbours blessed him
([Psa 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#003).md), praised him as doing well
for himself ([Psa 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#018).md); but God said
he did ill for himself: Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required
of thee, [Luk 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#020.md). God said to him,
that is, decreed this concerning him, and let him know it, either by his
conscience or by some awakening providence, or rather by both together.
This was said when he was in the fulness of his sufficiency ([Job
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#022).md), when his eyes were held waking
upon his bed with his cares and contrivances about enlarging his barns,
not by adding a bay or two more of building to them, which might serve
to answer the end, but by pulling them down and building greater, which
was requisite to please his fancy. When he was forecasting this, and had
brought it to an issue, and then lulled himself asleep again with a
pleasing dream of many years' enjoyment of his present improvements,
then God said this to him. Thus Belshazzar was struck with terror by the
hand-writing on the wall, in the midst of his jollity. Now observe what
God said,

\[1.\] The character he gave him: Thou fool, thou Nabal, alluding to the
story of Nabal, that fool (Nabal is his name, and folly is with him)
whose heart was struck dead as a stone while he was regaling himself in
the abundance of his provision for his sheep-shearers. Note, Carnal
worldlings are fools, and the day is coming when God will call them by
their own name, Thou fool, and they will call themselves so.

\[2.\] The sentence he passed upon him, a sentence of death: This night
thy soul shall be required of thee; they shall require thy soul (so the
words are), and then whose shall those things be which thou hast
provided? He thought he had goods that should be his for many years, but
he must part from them this night; he thought he should enjoy them
himself, but he must leave them to he knows not who. Note, The death of
carnal worldlings is miserable in itself and terrible to them.

First, It is a force, an arrest; it is the requiring of the soul, that
soul that thou art making such a fool of; what hast thou to do with a
soul, who canst use it no better? Thy soul shall be required; this
intimates that he is loth to part with it. A good man, who has taken his
heart off from this world, cheerfully resigns his soul at death, and
gives it up; but a worldly man has it torn from him with violence; it is
a terror to him to think of leaving this world. They shall require thy
soul. God shall require it; he shall require an account of it. "Man,
woman, what hast thou done with thy soul. Give an account of that
stewardship." They shall; that is, evil angels as the messengers of
God's justice. As good angels receive gracious souls to carry them to
their joy, so evil angels receive wicked souls to carry them to the
place of torment; they shall require it as a guilty soul to be punished.
The devil requires thy soul as his own, for it did, in effect, give
itself to him.

Secondly, It is a surprise, an unexpected force. It is in the night, and
terrors in the night are most terrible. The time of death is day-time to
a good man; it is his morning. But it is night to a worldling, a dark
night; he lies down in sorrow. It is this night, this present night,
without delay; there is no giving bail, or begging a day. This pleasant
night, when thou art promising thyself many years to come, now thou must
die, and go to judgment. Thou art entertaining thyself with the fancy of
many a merry day, and merry night, and merry feast; but, in the midst of
all, here is an end of all, [Isa 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#004.md).

Thirdly, It is the leaving of all those things behind which they have
provided, which they have laboured for, and prepared for hereafter, with
abundance of toil and care. All that which they have placed their
happiness in, and built their hope upon, and raised their expectations
fRom. they must leave behind. Their pomp shall not descend after them
([Psa 49:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#017).md), but they shall go as
naked out of the world as they came into it, and they shall have no
benefit at all by what they have hoarded up either in death, in
judgment, or in their everlasting state.

Fourthly, It is leaving them to they know not who: "Then whose shall
those things be? Not thine to be sure, and thou knowest not what they
will prove for whom thou didst design them, thy children and relations,
whether they will be wise or fools ([Ecc
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#018.md), [Ecc
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#019).md), whether such as will bless thy
memory or curse it, be a credit to thy family or a blemish, do good or
hurt with what thou leavest them, keep it or spend it; nay, thou knowest
not but those for whom thou dost design it may be prevented from the
enjoyment of it, and it may be turned to somebody else thou little
thinkest of; nay, though thou knowest to whom thou leavest it, thou
knowest not to whom they will leave it, or into whose hand it will come
at last." If many a man could have foreseen to whom his house would have
come after his death, he would rather have burned it than beautified it.

Fifthly, It is a demonstration of his folly. Carnal worldlings are fools
while they live: this their way is their folly ([Psa
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#013).md); but their folly is made most
evident when they die: at his end he shall be a fool ([Jer
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#011).md); for then it will appear that
he took pains to lay up treasure in a world he was hastening fRom. but
took no care to lay it up in the world he was hastening to.

Lastly, Here is the application of this parable ([Luk
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#021).md): So is he, such a fool, a fool
in God's judgment, a fool upon record, that layeth up treasure for
himself, and is not rich towards God. This is the way and this is the
end of such a man. Observe here,

1\. The description of a worldly man: He lays up treasure for himself,
for the body, for the world, for himself in opposition to God, for that
self that is to be denied. (1.) It is his error that he counts his flesh
himself, as if the body were the man. If self be rightly stated and
understood, it is only the true Christian that lays up treasure for
himself, and is wise for himself, [Pro
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#012). (2..md) It is his error that he
makes it his business to lay up for the flesh, which he calls laying up
for himself. All his labour is for his mouth ([Ecc
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#007).md), making provision for the flesh.
(3.) It is his error that he counts those things his treasure which are
thus laid up for the world, and the body, and the life that now is; they
are the wealth he trusts to, and spends upon, and lets out his
affections toward. (4.) The greatest error of all is that he is in no
care to be rich towards God, rich in the account of God, whose
accounting us rich makes us so ([Rev
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#009).md), rich in the things of God, rich
in faith ([Jam 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#005).md), rich in good
works, in the fruits of righteousness ([Ti1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#018).md), rich in graces, and comforts,
and spiritual gifts. Many who have abundance of this world are wholly
destitute of that which will enrich their souls, which will make them
rich towards God, rich for eternity.

2\. The folly and misery of a worldly man: So is he. Our Lord Jesus
Christ, who knows what the end of things will be, has here told us what
his end will be. Note, It is the unspeakable folly of the most of men to
mind and pursue the wealth of this world more than the wealth of the
other world, that which is merely for the body and for time, more than
that which is for the soul and eternity.

[Luke 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 12:22</span></span>

Our Lord Jesus is here inculcating some needful useful lessons upon his
disciples, which he had before taught them, and had occasion afterwards
to press upon them; for they need to have precept upon precept, and line
upon line: "Therefore, because there are so many that are ruined by
covetousness, and an inordinate affection to the wealth of this world, I
say unto you, my disciples, take heed of it." Thou, O man of God, flee
these things, as well as thou, O man of the world, [Ti1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#011.md).

I. He charges them not to afflict themselves with disquieting perplexing
cares about the necessary supports of life: Take no thought for your
life, [Luk 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#022.md). In the foregoing
parable he had given us warning against that branch of covetousness of
which rich people are most in danger; and that is, a sensual complacency
in the abundance of this world's goods. Now his disciples might think
they were in no danger of this, for they had no plenty or variety to
glory in; and therefore he here warns them against another branch of
covetousness, which they are most in temptation to that have but a
little of this world, which was the case of the disciples at best and
much more now that they had left all to follow Christ, and that was, an
anxious solicitude about the necessary supports of life: "Take no
thought for your life, either for the preservation of it, if it be in
danger, or for the provision that is to be made for it, either of food
or clothing, what ye shall eat or what ye shall put on." This is the
caution he had largely insisted upon, [Mat
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025.md), etc.; and the arguments here
used are much the same, designed for our encouragement to cast all our
care upon God, which is the right way to ease ourselves of it. Consider
then,

1\. God, who has done the greater for us, may be depended upon to do the
less. He has, without any care or forecast of our own, given us life and
a body, and therefore we may cheerfully leave it to him to provide meat
for the support of that life, and raiment for the defence of that body.

2\. God, who provides for the inferior creatures, may be depended upon
to provide for good Christians. "Trust God for meat, for he feeds the
ravens ([Luk 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#024).md); they neither sow
nor reap, they take neither care nor pains beforehand to provide for
themselves, and yet they are fed, and never perish for want. Now
consider how much better ye are than the fowls, than the ravens. Trust
God for clothing, for he clothes the lilies ([Luk
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#027.md), [Luk
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#028).md); they make no preparation for
their own clothing, they toil not, they spin not, the root in the ground
is a naked thing, and without ornament, and yet, as the flower grows up,
it appears wonderfully beautified. Now, if God has so clothed the
flowers, which are fading perishing things, shall he not much more
clothe you with such clothing as is fit for you, and with clothing
suited to your nature, as theirs is?" When God fed Israel with manna in
the wilderness, he also took care for their clothing; for though he did
not furnish them with new clothes, yet (which came all to one) he
provided that those they had should not wax old upon them, [Deu
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#004.md). Thus will he clothe his spiritual
Israel; but then let them not be of little faith. Note, Our inordinate
cares are owing to the weakness of our faith; for a powerful practical
belief of the all-sufficiency of God, his covenant-relation to us as a
Father, and especially his precious promises, relating both to this life
and that to come, would be mighty, through God, to the pulling down of
the strong holds of these disquieting perplexing imaginations.

3\. Our cares are fruitless, vain, and insignificant, and therefore it
is folly to indulge them. They will not gain us our wishes, and
therefore ought not to hinder our repose ([Luk
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#025).md): "Which of you by taking
thought can add to his stature one cubit, or one inch, can add to his
age one year or one hour? Now if ye be not able to do that which is
least, if it be not in your power to alter your statures, why should you
perplex yourselves about other things, which are as much out of your
power, and about which it is necessary that we refer ourselves to the
providence of God?" Note, As in our stature, so in our state, it is our
wisdom to take it as it is, and make the best of it; for fretting and
vexing, carping and caring, will not mend it.

4\. An inordinate anxious pursuit of the things of this world, even
necessary things, very ill becomes the disciples of Christ ([Luk
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#029.md), [Luk
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#030).md): "Whatever others do, seek not
ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; do not you afflict
yourselves with perplexing cares, nor weary yourselves with constant
toils; do not hurry hither and thither with enquiries what you shall eat
or drink, as David's enemies, that wandered up and down for meat ([Psa
59:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#015).md), or as the eagle that seeks the
prey afar off, [Job 39:29](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#029.md). Let not the
disciples of Christ thus seek their food, but ask it of God day by day;
let them not be of doubtful mind; mē meteōrizesthe - Be not as meteors
in the air, that are blown hither and thither with every wind; do not,
like them, rise and fall, but maintain a consistency with yourselves; be
even and steady, and have your hearts fixed; live not in careful
suspense; let not your minds be continually perplexed between hope and
fear, ever upon the rack." Let not the children of God make themselves
uneasy; for,

(1.) This is to make themselves like the children of this world: "All
these things do the nations of the world seek after, [Luk
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#030.md). They that take care for the
body only, and not for the soul, for this world only, and not for the
other, look no further than what they shall eat and drink; and, having
no all-sufficient God to seek to and confide in, they burden themselves
with anxious cares about those things. But it ill becomes you to do so.
You, who are called out of the world, ought not to be thus conformed to
the world, and to walk in the way of this people," [Isa
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#011.md), [Isa
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#012.md). When inordinate cares prevail
over us, we should think, "What am I, a Christian or a heathen? Baptized
or not baptized? If a Christian, if baptized, shall I rank myself with
Gentiles, and join with them in their pursuits?"

(2.) It is needless for them to disquiet themselves with care about the
necessary supports of life; for they have a Father in heaven who does
and will take care for them: "Your Father knows that you have need of
these things, and considers it, and will supply your needs according to
his riches in glory; for he is your Father, who made you subject to
these necessities, and therefore will suit his compassions to them: your
Father, who maintains you, educates you, and designs an inheritance for
you, and therefore will take care that you want no good thing."

(3.) They have better things to mind and pursue ([Luk
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#031).md): "But rather seek ye the
kingdom of God, and mind this, you, my disciples, who are to preach the
kingdom of God; let your hearts be upon your work, and your great care
how to do that well, and this will effectually divert your thoughts from
inordinate care about things of the world. And let all that have souls
to save seek the kingdom of God, in which only they can be safe. Seek
admission into it, seek advancement in it; seek the kingdom of grace, to
be subjects in that; the kingdom of glory, to be princes in that; and
then all these things shall be added to you. Mind the affairs of your
souls with diligence and care, and then trust God with all your other
affairs."

(4.) They have better things to expect and hope for: Fear not, little
flock, [Luk 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#032.md). For the banishing
of inordinate cares, it is necessary that fears should be suppressed.
When we frighten ourselves with an apprehension of evil to come, we put
ourselves upon the stretch of care how to avoid it, when after all
perhaps it is but the creature of our own imagination. Therefore fear
not, little flock, but hope to the end; for it is your Father's good
pleasure to give you the kingdom. This comfortable word we had not in
Matthew. Note, \[1.\] Christ's flock in this world is a little flock;
his sheep are but few and feeble. The church is a vineyard, a garden, a
small spot, compared with the wilderness of this world; as Israel ([Kg1
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#027).md), who were like two little
flocks of kids, when the Syrians filled the country. \[2.\] Though it be
a little flock, quite over-numbered, and therefore in danger of being
overpowered, by its enemies, yet it is the will of Christ that they
should not be afraid: "Fear not, little flock, but see yourselves safe
under the protection and conduct of the great and good Shepherd, and lie
easy." \[3.\] God has a kingdom in store for all that belong to Christ's
little flock, a crown of glory ([Pe1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004).md), a throne of power ([Rev
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021).md), unsearchable riches, far
exceeding the peculiar treasures of kings and provinces. The sheep on
the right hand are called to come and inherit the kingdom; it is theirs
for ever; a kingdom for each. \[4.\] The kingdom is given according to
the good pleasure of the Father; It is your Father's good pleasure; it
is given not of debt, but of grace, free grace, sovereign grace; even
so, Father, because it seemed good unto thee. The kingdom is his; and
may he not do what he will with his own? \[5.\] The believing hopes and
prospects of the kingdom should silence and suppress the fears of
Christ's little flock in this world. "Fear no trouble; for, though it
should come, it shall not come between you and the kingdom, that is
sure, it is near." (That is not an evil worth trembling at the thought
of which cannot separate us from the love of God). "Fear not the want of
any thing that is good for you; for, if it be your Father's good
pleasure to give you the kingdom, you need not question but he will bear
your charges thither."

II\. He charged them to make sure work for their souls, by laying up
their treasure in heaven, [Luk 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#033.md),
[Luk 12:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#034.md). Those who have done this
may be very easy as to all the events of time.

1\. "Sit loose to this world, and to all your possessions in it: Sell
that ye have, and give alms," that is, "rather than want wherewith to
relieve those that are truly necessitous, sell what you have that is
superfluous, all that you can spare from the support of yourselves and
families, and give it to the poor. Sell what you have, if you find it a
hindrance fRom. or incumbrance in, the service of Christ. Do not think
yourselves undone, if by being fined, imprisoned, or banished, for the
testimony of Jesus, you be forced to sell your estates, thought they be
the inheritance of your fathers. Do not sell to hoard up the money, or
because you can make more of it by usury, but sell and give alms; what
is given in alms, in a right manner, is put out to the best interest,
upon the best security."

2\. "Set your hearts upon the other world, and your expectations from
that world. Provide yourselves bags that wax not old, that wax not
empty, not of gold, but of grace in the heart and good works in the
life; these are the bags that will last." Grace will go with us into
another world, for it is woven in the soul; and our good works will
follow us, for God is not unrighteous to forget them. These will be
treasures in heaven, that will enrich us to eternity. (1.) It is
treasure that will not be exhausted; we may spend upon it to eternity,
and it will not be at all the less; there is no danger of seeing the
bottom of it. (2.) It is treasure that we are in no danger of being
robbed of, for no thief approaches near it; what is laid up in heaven is
out of reach of enemies. (3.) It is treasure that will not spoil with
keeping, any more than it will waste with spending; the moth does not
corrupt it, as it does our garments which we now wear. Now by this it
appears that we have laid up our treasure in heaven if our hearts be
there while we are here ([Luk 12:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#034).md),
if we think much of heaven and keep our eye upon it, if we quicken
ourselves with the hopes of it and keep ourselves in awe with the fear
of falling short of it. But, if your hearts be set upon the earth and
the things of it, it is to be feared that you have your treasure and
portion in it, and are undone when you leave it.

III\. He charges them to get ready, and to keep in a readiness for
Christ's coming, when all those who have laid up their treasure in
heaven shall enter upon the enjoyment of it, [Luk
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#035.md), etc.

1\. Christ is our Master, and we are his servants, not only working
servants, but waiting servants, servants that are to do him honour, in
waiting on him, and attending his motions: If any man serve me, let him
follow me. Follow the Lamb whithersoever he goes. But that is not all:
they must do him honour in waiting for him, and expecting his return. We
must be as men that wait for their Lord, that sit up late while he stays
out late, to be ready to receive him.

2\. Christ our Master, though now gone from us, will return again,
return from the wedding, from solemnizing the nuptials abroad, to
complete them at home. Christ's servants are now in a state of
expectation, looking for their Master's glorious appearing, and doing
every thing with an eye to that, and in order to that. He will come to
take cognizance of his servants, and, that being a critical day, they
shall either stay with him or be turned out of doors, according as they
are found in that day.

3\. The time of our Master's return is uncertain; it will be in the
night, it will be far in the night, when he has long deferred his
coming, and when many have done looking for him; in the second watch,
just before midnight, or in the third watch, next after midnight, [Luk
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#038.md). His coming to us, at our death,
is uncertain, and to many it will be a great surprise; for the Son of
Man cometh at an hour that ye think not ([Luk
12:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#040).md), without giving notice
beforehand. This bespeaks not only the uncertainty of the time of his
coming, but the prevailing security of the greatest part of men, who are
unthinking, and altogether regardless of the notices given them, so
that, whenever he comes, it is in an hour that they think not.

4\. That which he expects and requires from his servants is that they be
ready to open to him immediately, whenever he comes ([Luk
12:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#036).md), that is, that they be in a
frame fit to receive him, or rather to be received by him; that they be
found as his servants, in the posture that becomes them, with their
loins girded about, alluding to the servants that are ready to go
whither their master sends them, and do what their master bids them,
having their long garments tucked up (which otherwise would hang about
them, and hinder them), and their lights burning, with which to light
their master into the house, and up to his chamber.

5\. Those servants will be happy who shall be found ready, and in a good
frame, when their Lord shall come ([Luk
12:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#037).md): Blessed are those servants
who, after having waited long, continue in a waiting frame, until the
hour that their Lord comes, and are then found awake and aware of his
first approach, of his first knock; and again ([Luk
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#038).md): Blessed are those servants,
for then will be the time of their preferment. Here is such an instance
of honour done them as is scarcely to be found among men: He will make
them sit down to meat, and will serve them. For the bridegroom to wait
upon his bride at table is not uncommon, but to wait upon his servants
is not the manner of men; yet Jesus Christ was among his disciples as
one that served, and did once, to show his condescension, gird himself,
and serve them, when he washed their feet ([Joh
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#004.md), [Joh
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#005).md); it signified the joy with which
they shall be received into the other world by the Lord Jesus, who is
gone before, to prepare for them, and has told them that his Father will
honour them, [Joh 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#026.md).

6\. We are therefore kept at uncertainty concerning the precise time of
his coming that we may be always ready; for it is no thanks to a man to
be ready for an attack, if he know beforehand just the time when it will
be made: The good man of the house, if he had known what hour the thief
would have come, though he were ever so careless a man, would yet have
watched, and have frightened away the thieves, [Luk
12:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#039.md). But we do not know at what hour
the alarm will be given us, and therefore are concerned to watch at all
tines, and never to be off our guard. Or this may intimate the miserable
case of those who are careless and unbelieving in this great matter. If
the good man of the house had had notice of his danger of being robbed
such a night, he would have sat up, and saved his house; but we have
notice of the day of the Lord's coming, as a thief in the night, to the
confusion and ruin of all secure sinners, and yet do not thus watch. If
men will take such care of their houses, O let us be thus wise for our
souls: Be ye therefore ready also, as ready as the good man of the house
would be if he knew what hour the thief would come.

[Luke 12:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 12:41</span></span>

Here is, I. Peter's question, which he put to Christ upon occasion of
the foregoing parable ([Luk 12:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#041).md):
"Lord, speakest thou this parable to us that are thy constant followers,
to us that are ministers, or also to all that come to be taught by thee,
to all the hearers, and in them to all Christians?" Peter was now, as
often, spokesman for the disciples. We have reason to bless God that
there are some such forward men, that have a gift of utterance; let
those that are such take heed of being proud. Now Peter desires Christ
to explain himself, and to direct the arrow of the foregoing parable to
the mark he intended. He calls it a parable, because it was not only
figurative, but weighty, solid, and instructive. Lord, said Peter, was
it intended for us, or for all? To this Christ gives a direct answer
([Mar 13:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#037).md): What I say unto you, I
say unto all. Yet here he seems to show that the apostles were primarily
concerned in it. Note, We are all concerned to take to ourselves what
Christ in his word designs for us, and to enquire accordingly concerning
it: Speakest thou this to us? To me? Speak, Lord, for thy servant hears.
Doth this word belong to me? Speak it to my heart.

II\. Christ's reply to this question, directed to Peter and the rest of
the disciples. If what Christ had said before did not so peculiarly
concern them, but in common with other Christians, who must all watch
and pray for Christ's coming, as his servants, yet this that follows is
peculiarly adapted to ministers, who are the stewards in Christ's house.
Now our Lord Jesus here tells them,

1\. What was their duty as stewards, and what the trust committed to
them. (1.) They are made rulers of God's household, under Christ, whose
own the house is; ministers derive an authority from Christ to preach
the gospel, and to administer the ordinances of Christ, and apply the
seals of the covenant of grace. (2.) Their business is to give God's
children and servants their portion of meat, that which is proper for
them and allotted to them; convictions and comfort to those to whom they
respectively belong. Suum cuique - to every one his own. This is rightly
to divide the word of truth, [Ti2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#015). (3..md) To give it to them in due
season, at that time and in that way which are most suitable to the
temper and condition of those that are to be fed; a word in season to
him that is weary. (4.) Herein they must approve themselves faithful and
wise; faithful to their Master, by whom this great trust is reposed in
them, and faithful to their fellow-servants, for whose benefit they are
put in trust; and wise to improve an opportunity of doing honour to
their Master, and service in the family. Ministers must be both skilful
and faithful.

2\. What would be their happiness if they approved themselves faithful
and wise ([Luk 12:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#043).md): Blessed is that
servant, (1.) That is doing, and is not idle, nor indulgent of his ease;
even the rulers of the household must be doing, and make themselves
servants of all. (2.) That is so doing, doing as he should be, giving
them their portion of meat, by public preaching and personal
application. (3.) That is found so doing when his Lord comes; that
perseveres to the end, notwithstanding the difficulties he may meet with
in the way. Now his happiness is illustrated by the preferment of a
steward that has approved himself within a lower and narrower degree of
service; he shall be preferred to a larger and higher ([Luk
12:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#044).md): He will make him ruler over
all that he has, which was Joseph's preferment in Pharaoh's court. Note,
Ministers that obtain mercy of the Lord to be faithful shall obtain
further mercy to be abundantly rewarded for their faithfulness in the
day of the Lord.

3\. What a dreadful reckoning there would be if they were treacherous
and unfaithful, [Luk 12:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#045.md), [Luk
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#046.md). If that servant begin to be
quarrelsome and profane, he shall be called to an account, and severely
punished. We had all this before in Matthew, and therefore shall here
only observe, (1.) Our looking upon Christ's second coming as a thing at
a distance is the cause of all those irregularities which render the
thought of it terrible to us: He saith in his heart, My Lord delays his
coming. Christ's patience is very often misinterpreted his delay, to the
discouragement of his people, and the encouragement of his enemies. (2.)
The persecutors of God's people are commonly abandoned to security and
sensuality; they beat their fellow-servants, and then eat and drink with
the drunken, altogether unconcerned either at their own sin or their
brethren's sufferings, as the king and Haman, who sat down to drink when
the city Shushan was perplexed. Thus they drink, to drown the clamours
of their own consciences, and baffle them, which would otherwise fly in
their faces. (3.) Death and judgment will be very terrible to all wicked
people, but especially to wicked ministers. It will be a surprise to
them: At an hour when they are not aware. It will be the determining of
them to endless misery; they shall be cut in sunder, and have their
portion assigned them with the unbelievers.

4\. What an aggravation it would be of their sin and punishment that
they knew their duty, and did not do it ([Luk
12:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#047.md), [Luk
12:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#048).md): That servant that knew his
lord's will, and did it not, shall be beaten with many stripes, shall
fall under a sorer punishment; and he that knew not shall be beaten with
few stripes, his punishment shall, in consideration of this, be
mitigated. Here seems to be an allusion to the law, which made a
distinction between sins committed through ignorance, and presumptuous
sins ([Lev 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#015.md), etc.; [Num
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#029.md), [Num
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#030).md), as also to another law
concerning the number of stripes given to a malefactor, to be according
to the nature of the crime, [Deu 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#002.md),
[Deu 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#003). Now, (1..md) Ignorance of our
duty is an extenuation of sin. He that knew not his lord's will, through
carelessness and neglect, and his not having such opportunities as some
others had of coming to the knowledge of it, and did things worthy of
stripes, he shall be beaten, because he might have known his duty
better, but with few stripes; his ignorance excuses in part, but not
wholly. Thus through ignorance the Jews put Christ to death ([Act
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#017.md); [Co1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008).md), and Christ pleaded that
ignorance in their excuse: They know not what they do. (2.) The
knowledge of our duty is an aggravation of our sin: That servant that
knew his lord's will, and yet did his own will, shall be beaten with
many stripes. God will justly inflict more upon him for abusing the
means of knowledge he afforded him, which others would have made a
better use of, because it argues a great degree of wilfulness and
contempt to sin against knowledge; of how much sorer punishment then
shall they be thought worthy, besides the many stripes that their own
consciences will give them! Son, remember. Here is a good reason for
this added: To whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required,
especially when it is committed as a trust he is to account for. Those
have greater capacities of mind than others, more knowledge and
learning, more acquaintance and converse with the scriptures, to them
much is given, and their account will be accordingly.

III\. A further discourse concerning his own sufferings, which he
expected, and concerning the sufferings of his followers, which he would
have them also to live in expectation of. In general ([Luk
12:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#049).md): I am come to send fire on the
earth. By this some understand the preaching of the gospel, and the
pouring out of the Spirit, holy fire; this Christ came to send with a
commission to refine the world, to purge away its dross, to burn up its
chaff, and it was already kindled. The gospel was begun to be preached;
some prefaces there were to the pouring out of the Spirit. Christ
baptized with the Holy Ghost and with fire; this Spirit descended in
fiery tongues. But, by what follows, it seems rather to be understood of
the fire of persecution. Christ is not the Author of it, as it is the
sin of the incendiaries, the persecutors; but he permits it, nay, he
commissions it, as a refining fire for the trial of the persecuted. This
fire was already kindled in the enmity of the carnal Jews to Christ and
his followers. "What will I that it may presently be kindled? What thou
doest, do quickly. If it be already kindled, what will I? Shall I wait
the quenching of it? No, for it must fasten upon myself, and upon all,
and glory will redound to God from it."

1\. He must himself suffer many things; he must pass through this fire
that was already kindled ([Luk 12:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#050).md):
I have a baptism to be baptized with. Afflictions are compared both to
fire and water, [Psa 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012.md); [Psa
69:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001.md), [Psa
69:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#002.md). Christ's sufferings were both.
He calls them a baptism ([Mat 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#022).md);
for he was watered or sprinkled with them, as Israel was baptized in the
cloud, and dipped into them, as Israel was baptized in the sea, [Co1
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#002.md). He must be sprinkled with his
own blood, and with the blood of his enemies, [Isa
63:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#003). See here, (1..md) Christ's
foresight of his sufferings; he knew what he was to undergo, and the
necessity of undergoing it: I am to be baptized with a baptism. He calls
his sufferings by a name that mitigates them; it is a baptism, not a
deluge; I must be dipped in them, not drowned in them; and by a name
that sanctifies them, for baptism is a name that sanctifies them, for
baptism is a sacred rite. Christ in his sufferings devoted himself to
his Father's honour, and consecrated himself a priest for evermore, [Heb
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#027.md), [Heb
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#028). (2..md) Christ's forwardness to his
sufferings: How am I straitened till it be accomplished! He longed for
the time when he should suffer and die, having an eye to the glorious
issue of his sufferings. It is an allusion to a woman in travail, that
is pained to be delivered, and welcomes her pains, because they hasten
the birth of the child, and wishes them sharp and strong, that the work
may be cut short. Christ's sufferings were the travail of his soul,
which he cheerfully underwent, in hope that he should by them see his
seed, [Isa 53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md), [Isa
53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011.md). So much was his heart set upon
the redemption and salvation of man.

2\. He tells those about him that they also must bear with hardships and
difficulties ([Luk 12:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#051).md): "Suppose ye
that I came to give peace on earth, to give you a peaceable possession
of the earth, and outward prosperity on the earth?" It is intimated that
they were ready to entertain such a thought as this, nay, that they went
upon this supposition, that the gospel would meet with a universal
welcome, that people unanimously embrace it, and would therefore study
to make the preachers of it easy and great, that Christ, if he did not
give them pomp and power, would at least give them peace; and herein
they were encouraged by divers passages of the Old Testament, which
speak of the peace of the Messiah's kingdom, which they were willing to
understand of external peace. "But," saith Christ, "you will be
mistaken, the event will declare the contrary, and therefore do not
flatter yourselves into a fool's paradise. You will find,"

(1.) "That the effect of the preaching of the gospel will be division."
Not but that the design of the gospel and its proper tendency are to
unite the children of men to one another, to knit them together in holy
love, and, if all would receive it, this would be the effect of it; but
there being multitudes that not only will not receive it, but oppose it,
and have their corruptions exasperated by it, and are enraged at those
that do receive it, it proves, though not the cause yet the occasion of
division. While the strong man armed kept his palace, in the Gentile
world, his goods were at peace; all was quiet, for all went one way, the
sects of philosophers agreed well enough, so did the worshippers of
different deities; but when the gospel was preached, and many were
enlightened by it, and turned from the power of Satan to God, then there
was a disturbance, a noise and a shaking, [Eze
37:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#007.md). Some distinguished themselves by
embracing the gospel, and others were angry that they did so. Yea, and
among them that received the gospel there would be different sentiments
in minor things, which would occasion division; and Christ permits it
for holy ends ([Co1 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#018).md), that
Christians may learn and practise mutual forbearance, [Rom
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#001.md), [Rom
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#002.md).

(2.) "That this division will reach into private families, and the
preaching of the gospel will give occasion for discord among the nearest
relations" ([Luk 12:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#053).md): The father
shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father, when
the one turns Christian and the other does not; for the one that does
turn Christian will be zealous by arguments and endearments to turn the
other too, [Co1 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#016.md). As soon as ever
Paul was converted, he disputed, [Act
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#029.md). The one that continues in
unbelief will be provoked, and will hate and persecute the one that by
his faith and obedience witnesses against, and condemns, his unbelief
and disobedience. A spirit of bigotry and persecution will break through
the strongest bonds of relation and natural affection; see [Mat
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#035.md); [Mat
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#007.md). Even mothers and daughters fall
out about religion; and those that believe not are so violent and
outrageous that they are ready to deliver up into the hands of the
bloody persecutors those that believe, though otherwise very near and
dear to them. We find in the Acts that, wherever the gospel came,
persecution was stirred up; it was every where spoken against, and there
was no small stir about that way. Therefore let not the disciples of
Christ promise themselves peace upon earth, for they are sent forth as
sheep in the midst of wolves.

[Luke 12:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">luk 12:54</span></span>

Having given his disciples their lesson in the foregoing verses, here
Christ turns to the people, and gives them theirs, [Luk
12:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#054.md). He said also to the people: he
preached ad populum - to the people, as well as ad clerum - to the
clergy. In general, he would have them be as wise in the affairs of
their souls as they are in their outward affairs. Two things he
specifies: -

I. Let them learn to discern the way of God towards them, that they may
prepare accordingly. They were weather-wise, and by observing the winds
and clouds could foresee when there would be rain and when there would
be hot weather ([Luk 12:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#054.md), [Luk
12:55](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#055).md); and, according as they foresaw
the weather would be, they either housed their hay and corn, or threw it
abroad, and equipped themselves for a journey? Even in regard to changes
of the weather God gives warning to us what is coming, and art has
improved the notices of nature in weather-glasses. The prognostications
here referred to had their origin in repeated observations upon the
chain of causes: from what has been we conjecture what will be. See the
benefit of experience; by taking notice we may come to give notice.
Whose is wise will observe and learn. See now.

1\. The particulars of the presages: "When you see a cloud arising out
of the west" (the Hebrew would say, out of the sea), "perhaps it is at
first no bigger than a man's hand ([Kg1
18:44](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#044).md), but you say, There is a shower
in the womb of it, and it proves so. When you observe the south wind
blow, you say, There will be heat" (for the hot countries of Africa lay
not far south from Judea), "and it usually comes to pass;" yet nature
has not ties itself to such a track but that sometimes we are mistaken
in our prognostics.

2\. The inferences from them ([Luk
12:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#056).md): "Ye hypocrites, who pretend to
be wise, but really are not so, who pretend to expect the Messiah and
his kingdom" (for so the generality of the Jews did) "and yet are no way
disposed to receive and entertain it, how is it that you do not discern
this time, that you do not discern that now is the time, according to
the indications given in the Old Testament prophecies, for the Messiah
to appear, and that, according to the marks given of him, I am he? Why
are you not aware that you have now an opportunity which you will not
have long, and which you may never have again, of securing to yourselves
an interest in the kingdom of God and the privileges of that kingdom?"
Now is the accepted time, now or never. It is the folly and misery of
man that he knows not his time, [Ecc
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#012.md). This was the ruin of the men of
that generation, that they knew not the day of their visitation, [Luk
19:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#044.md). But a wise man's heart discerns
time and judgment; such was the wisdom of the men of Issachar, who had
understanding of the times, [Ch1
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#032.md). He adds, "Yea, and why even of
yourselves, though ye had not these loud alarms given you, judge ye not
what is right? [Luk 12:57](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#057.md). You are not
only stupid and regardless in matters that are purely of divine
revelation, and take not the hints which that gives you, but you are so
even in the dictates of the very light and law of nature." Christianity
has reason and natural conscience on its side; and, if men would allow
themselves the liberty of judging what is right, they would soon find
that all Christ's precepts concerning all things are right, and that
there is nothing more equitable in itself, nor better becoming us, than
to submit to them and be ruled by them.

II\. Let them hasten to make their peace with God in time, before it be
too late, [Luk 12:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#058.md), [Luk
12:59](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#059.md). This we had upon another
occasion, [Mat 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#025.md), [Mat
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#026.md). 1. We reckon it our wisdom in
our temporal affairs to compound with those with whom we cannot contend,
to agree with our adversary upon the best terms we can, before the
equity be foreclosed, and we be left to the rigour of the law: "When
thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, to whom the appeal is
made, and knowest that he has an advantage against thee, and thou art in
danger of being cast, thou knowest it is the most prudent course to make
the matter up between yourselves; as thou art in the way, give diligence
to be delivered from him, to get a discharge, lest judgment be given,
and execution awarded according to law." Wise men will not let their
quarrels go to an extremity, but accommodate them in time. 2. Let us do
thus in the affairs of our souls. We have by sin made God our adversary,
have provoked his displeasure against us, and he has both right and
might on his side; so that it is to no purpose to think of carrying on
the controversy with him either at bar or in battle. Christ, to whom all
judgment is committed, is the magistrate before whom we are hastening to
appear: if we stand a trial before him, and insist upon our own
justification, the cause will certainly go against us, the Judge will
deliver us to the officer, the ministers of his justice, and we shall be
cast into the prison of hell, and the debt will be exacted to the
utmost; though we cannot make a full satisfaction for it, it will be
continually demanded, till the last mite be paid, which will not be to
all eternity. Christ's sufferings were short, yet the value of them made
them fully satisfactory. In the sufferings of damned sinners what is
wanting in value must be made up in an endless duration. Now, in
consideration of this, let us give diligence to be delivered out of the
hands of God as an adversary, into his hands as a Father, and this as we
are in the way, which has the chief stress laid upon it here. While we
are alive, we are in the way; and now is our time, by repentance and
faith through Christ (who is the Mediator as well as the magistrate), to
get the quarrel made up, while it may be done, before it be too late.
Thus was God in Christ reconciling the world to himself, beseeching us
to be reconciled. Let us take hold on the arm of the Lord stretched out
in this gracious offer, that we may make peace, and we shall make peace
([Isa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#004.md), [Isa
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#005).md), for we cannot walk together
till we be agreed.
