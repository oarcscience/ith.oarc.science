### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 22:0</span></span>

This chapter begins the story of the reign of good king Josiah, whose
goodness shines the brighter because it came just after so much
wickedness, which he had the honour to reform, and just before so great
a destruction, which yet he had not the honour to prevent. Here, after
his general character ([Kg2 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#001.md), [Kg2
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#002).md), we have a particular account of
the respect he paid I. To God's house, which he repaired ([Kg2
22:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#003).md). II. To God's book, which he
was much affected with the reading of ([Kg2
22:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#008).md). III. To God's messengers,
whom he thereupon consulted ([Kg2
22:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#012).md). And by whom he received
from God an answer threatening Jerusalem's destruction ([Kg2
22:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#015).md), but promising favour to him
([Kg2 22:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#018).md), upon which he set
about that glorious work of reformation which we have an account of in
the next chapter.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 22:1</span></span>

Concerning Josiah we are here told,

I. That he was very young when he began to reign ([Kg2
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#001).md), only eight years old. Solomon
says, Woe unto thee, O land! when thy king is a child; but happy art
thou, O land! when thy king is such a child. Our English Israel had once
a king that was such a child, Edward VI. Josiah, being young, had not
received any bad impressions from the example of his father and
grandfather, but soon saw their errors, and God gave his grace to take
warning by them. See [Eze 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#014.md), etc.

II\. That he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, [Kg2
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#002.md). See the sovereignty of divine
grace - the father passed by and left to perish in his sin, the son a
chosen vessel. See the triumphs of that grace - Josiah born of a wicked
father, no good education nor good example given him, but many about him
who no doubt advised him to tread in his father's steps and few that
gave him any good counsel, and yet the grace of God made him an eminent
saint, cut him off from the wild olive and grafted him into the good
olive, [Rom 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#024.md). Nothing is too hard
for that grace to do. He walked in a good way, and turned not aside (as
some of his predecessors had done who began well) to the right hand nor
to the left. There are errors on both hands, but God kept him in the
right way; he fell neither into superstition nor profaneness.

III\. That he took care for the repair of the temple. This he did in the
eighteenth year of his reign, [Kg2
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#003.md). Compare [Ch2
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#008.md). He began much sooner to seek the
Lord (as appears, [Ch2 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#003).md), but it
is to be feared the work of reformation went slowly on and met with much
opposition, so that he could not effect what he desired and designed,
till his power was thoroughly confirmed. The consideration of the time
we unavoidably lost in our minority should quicken us, when we have come
to years, to act with so much the more vigour in the service of God.
Having begun late we have need work hard. He sent Shaphan, the secretary
of state, to Hilkiah the high priest, to take an account of the money
that was collected for this use by the door-keepers ([Kg2
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#004).md); for, it seems, they took much
the same way of raising the money that Joash took, [Kg2
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#009.md). When people gave by a little at
a time the burden was insensible, and, the contribution being voluntary,
it was not complained of. This money, so collected, he ordered him to
lay out for the repair of the temple, [Kg2
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#005.md), [Kg2
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#006.md). And now, it seems, the workmen
(as in the days of Joash) acquitted themselves so well that there was no
reckoning made with them ([Kg2 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#007).md),
which is certainly mentioned to the praise of the workmen, that they
gained such a reputation for honesty, but whether to the praise of those
that employed them I know not; a man should count money (we say) after
his own father; it would not have been amiss to have reckoned with the
workmen, that others also might be satisfied of their honesty.

IV\. That, in repairing the temple, the book of the law was happily
found and brought to the king, [Kg2
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#008.md), [Kg2
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#010.md). Some think this book was the
autograph, or original manuscript, of the five books of Moses, under his
own hand; others think it was only an ancient and authentic copy. Most
likely it was that which, by the command of Moses, was laid up in the
most holy place, [Deu 31:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#024.md), etc. 1.
It seems, this book of the law was lost or missing. Perhaps it was
carelessly mislaid and neglected, thrown by into a corner (as some throw
their Bibles), by those that knew not the value of it, and forgotten
there; or it was maliciously concealed by some of the idolatrous kings,
or their agents, who were restrained by the providence of God or their
own consciences from burning and destroying it, but buried it, in hopes
it would never see the light again; or, as some think, it was carefully
laid up by some of its friends, lest it should fall into the hands of
its enemies. Whoever were the instruments of its preservation, we ought
to acknowledge the hand of God in it. If this was the only authentic
copy of the Pentateuch then in being, which had (as I may say) so narrow
a turn for its life and was so near perishing, I wonder the hearts of
all good people did not tremble for that sacred treasure, as Eli's for
the ark, and I am sure we now have reason to thank God, upon our knees,
for that happy providence by which Hilkiah found this book at this time,
found it when he sought it not, [Isa
65:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001.md). If the holy scriptures had not
been of God, they would not have been in being at this day; God's care
of the Bible is a plain indication of his interest in it. 2. Whether
this was the only authentic copy in being or no, it seems the things
contained in it were new both to the king himself and to the high
priest; for the king, upon the reading of it, rent his clothes. We have
reason to think that neither the command for the king's writing a copy
of the law, nor that for the public reading of the law every seventh
year ([Deu 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#018.md); [Deu
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#010.md), [Deu
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#011).md), had been observed for a long
time; and when the instituted means of keeping up religion are neglected
religion itself will soon go to decay. Yet, on the other hand, if the
book of the law was lost, it seems difficult to determine what rule
Josiah went by in doing that which was right in the sight of the Lord,
and how the priests and people kept up the rites of their religion. I am
apt to think that the people generally took up with abstracts of the
law, like our abridgements of the statutes, which the priests, to save
themselves the trouble of writing and the people of reading the book at
large, had furnished them with - a sort of ritual, directing them in the
observances of their religion, but leaving out what they thought fit,
and particularly the promises and threatenings (Lev. 26 and Deu. 28,
etc.), for I observe that these were the portions of the law which
Josiah was so much affected with ([Kg2
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#013).md), for these were new to him. No
summaries, extracts, or collections, out of the Bible (though they may
have their use) can be effectual to convey and preserve the knowledge of
God and his will like the Bible itself. It was no marvel that the people
were so corrupt when the book of the law was such a scarce thing among
them; where that vision is not the people perish. Those that endeavoured
to debauch them no doubt used all the arts they could to get that book
out of their hands. The church of Rome could not keep up the use of
images but by forbidding the use of the scripture. 3. It was a great
instance of God's favour, and a token for good to Josiah and his people,
that the book of the law was thus seasonably brought to light, to direct
and quicken that blessed reformation which Josiah had begun. It is a
sign that God has mercy in store for a people when he magnifies his law
among them and makes that honourable, and furnishes them with means for
the increase of scripture-knowledge. The translating of the scriptures
into vulgar tongues was the glory, strength, and joy of the Reformation
from Popery. It is observable that they were about a good work,
repairing the temple, when they found the book of the law. Those that do
their duty according to their knowledge shall have their knowledge
increased. To him that hath shall be given. The book of the law was an
abundant recompence for all their care and cost about the repair of the
temple. 4. Hilkiah the priest was exceedingly well pleased with the
discovery. "O," says he to Shaphan, "rejoice with me, for I have found
the book of the law, heurēka, heurēka, - I have found, I have found,
that jewel of inestimable value. Here, carry it to the king; it is the
richest jewel of his crown. Read it before him. He walks in the way of
David his father, and, if he be like him, he will love the book of the
law and bid that welcome; that will be his delight and his counsellor."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 22:11</span></span>

We hear no more of the repairing of the temple: no doubt that good work
went on well; but the book of the law that was found in it occupies us
now, and well it may. It is not laid up in the king's cabinet as a piece
of antiquity, a rarity to be admired, but it is read before the king.
Those put the truest honour upon their Bibles that study them and
converse with them daily, feed on that bread and walk by that light. Men
of honour and business must look upon an acquaintance with God's word to
be their best business and honour. Now here we have,

I. The impressions which the reading of the law made upon Josiah. He
rent his clothes, as one ashamed of the sin of his people and afraid of
the wrath of God; he had long thought the case of his kingdom bad, by
reason of the idolatries and impieties that had been found among them,
but he never thought it so bad as he perceived it to be by the book of
the law now read to him. The rending of his clothes signified the
rending of his heart for the dishonour done to God, and the ruin he saw
coming upon his people.

II\. The application he made to God hereupon: Go, enquire of the Lord
for me, [Kg2 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#013.md).

1\. Two things we may suppose he desired to know: - "Enquire, (1.) What
we shall do; what course we shall take to turn away God's wrath and
prevent the judgments which our sins have deserved." Convictions of sin
and wrath should put us upon this enquiry, What shall we do to be saved?
Wherewithal shall we come before the Lord? If you will thus enquire,
enquire quickly, before it be too late. (2.) "What we may expect and
must provide for." He acknowledges, "Our fathers have not hearkened to
the words of this book; if this be the rule of right, certainly our
fathers have been much in the wrong." Now that the commandment came sin
revived, and appeared sin; in the glass of the law, he saw the sins of
his people more numerous and more heinous than he had before seen them,
and more exceedingly sinful. He infers hence, "Certainly great is the
wrath that is kindled against us; if this be the word of God, as no
doubt it is, and he will be true to his word, as no doubt he will be, we
are all undone. I never thought the threatenings of the law so severe,
and the curses of the covenant so terrible, as now I find them to be; it
is time to look about us if these be in force against us." Note, Those
who are truly apprehensive of the weight of God's wrath cannot but be
very solicitous to obtain his favour, and inquisitive how they may make
their peace with him. Magistrates should enquire for their people, and
study how to prevent the judgments of God that they see hanging over
them.

2\. This enquiry Josiah sent, (1.) By some of his great men, who are
named [Kg2 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#012.md), and again [Kg2
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#014.md). Thus he put an honour upon the
oracle, by employing those of the first rank to attend it. (2.) To
Huldah the prophetess, [Kg2 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#014.md). The
spirit of prophecy, that inestimable treasure, was sometimes put not
only into earthen vessels, but into the weaker vessels, that the
excellency of the power might be of God. Miriam helped to lead Israel
out of Egypt ([Mic 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#004).md), Deborah
judged them, and now Huldah instructed them in the mind of God, and her
being a wife was no prejudice at all to her being a prophetess; marriage
is honourable in all. It was a mercy to Jerusalem that when Bibles were
scarce they had prophets, as afterwards, when prophecy ceased, that they
had more Bibles; for God never leaves himself without witness, because
he will leave sinners without excuse. Jeremiah and Zephaniah prophesied
at this time, yet the king's messengers made Huldah their oracle,
probably because her husband having a place at court (for he was keeper
of the wardrobe) they had had more and longer acquaintance with her and
greater assurances of her commission than of any other; they had, it is
likely, consulted her upon other occasions, and had found that the word
of God in her mouth was truth. She was near, for she dwelt at Jerusalem,
in a place called Mishneh, the second rank of buildings from the royal
palace. The Jews say that she prophesied among the women, the court
ladies, being herself one of them, who it is probable had their
apartments in that place. Happy the court that had a prophetess within
the verge of it, and knew how to value her.

III\. The answer he received from God to his enquiry. Huldah returned it
not in the language of a courtier - "Pray give my humble service to his
Majesty, and let him know that this is the message I have for him from
the God of Israel;" but in the dialect of a prophetess, speaking from
him before whom all stand upon the same level - Tell the man that sent
you to me, [Kg2 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#015.md). Even kings,
though gods to us, are men to God, and shall so be dealt with; for with
him there is no respect of persons.

1\. She let him know what judgments God had in store for Judah and
Jerusalem ([Kg2 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#016.md), [Kg2
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#017).md): My wrath shall be kindled
against this place; and what is hell itself but the fire of God's wrath
kindled against sinners? Observe, (1.) The degree and duration of it. It
is so kindled that it shall not be quenched; the decree has gone forth;
it is too late now to think of preventing it; the iniquity of Jerusalem
shall not be purged with sacrifice or offering. Hell is unquenchable
fire. (2.) The reference it has, \[1.\] To their sins: "They have
committed them, as it were, with design, and on purpose to provoke me to
anger. It is a fire of their own kindling; they would provoke me, and at
length I am provoked." \[2.\] To God's threatenings: "The evil I bring
is according to the words of the book which the king of Judah has read;
the scripture is fulfilled in it. Those that would not be bound by the
precept shall be bound by the penalty." God will be found no less
terrible to impenitent sinners than his word makes him to be.

2\. She let him know what mercy God had in store for him. (1.) Notice is
taken of his great tenderness and concern for the glory of God and the
welfare of his kingdom ([Kg2 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#019).md):
Thy heart was tender. Note, God will distinguish those that distinguish
themselves. The generality of the people were hardened and their hearts
unhumbled, so were the wicked kings his predecessors, but Josiah's heart
was tender. He received the impressions of God's word, trembled at it
and yielded to it; he was exceedingly grieved for the dishonour done to
God by the sins of his fathers and of his people; he was afraid of the
judgments of God, which he saw coming upon Jerusalem, and earnestly
deprecated them. This is tenderness of heart, and thus he humbled
himself before the Lord, and expressed these pious affections by rending
his clothes and weeping before God, probably in his closet; but he that
sees in secret says it was before him, and he heard it, and put every
tear of tenderness into his bottle. Note, Those that most fear God's
wrath are least likely to feel it. It should seem that those words ([Lev
26:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#032).md) much affected Josiah, I will
bring the land into desolation; for when he heard of the desolation and
of the curse, that is, that God would forsake them and separate them to
evil (for till it came to that they were neither desolate nor accursed),
then he rent his clothes: the threatening went to his heart. (2.) A
reprieve is granted till after his death ([Kg2
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#020).md): I will gather thee to thy
fathers. The saints then, no doubt, had a comfortable prospect of
happiness on the other side death, else being gathered to their fathers
would not have been so often made the matter of a promise as we find it
was. Josiah could not prevail to prevent the judgment itself, but God
promised him he should not live to see it, which (especially considering
that he died in the midst of his days, before he was forty years old)
would have been but a small reward for his eminent piety if there had
not been another world in which he should be abundantly recompensed,
[Heb 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016.md). When the righteous is
taken away from the evil to come he enters into peace, [Isa
57:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001.md), [Isa
57:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#002.md). This is promised to Josiah here:
Thou shalt go to thy grave in peace, which refers not to the manner of
his death (for he was killed in a battle), but to the time of it; it was
a little before the captivity in Babylon, that great trouble, in
comparison with which the rest were as nothing, so that he might be
truly said to die in peace that did not live to share in that. He died
in the love and favour of God, which secure such a peace as no
circumstances of dying, no, not dying in the field of war, could alter
the nature of, or break in upon.
