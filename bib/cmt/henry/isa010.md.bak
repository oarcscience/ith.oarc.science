### [Isaiah Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 10:0</span></span>

The prophet, in this chapter, is dealing, I. With the proud oppressors
of his people at home, that abused their power, to pervert justice, whom
he would reckon with for their tyranny ([Isa
10:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#001).md). II. With a threatening
invader of his people from abroad, Sennacherib king of Assyria,
concerning whom observe, 1. The commission given him to invade Judah
([Isa 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md), [Isa
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#006).md). 2. His pride and insolence in
the execution of that commission ([Isa
10:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#007.md), [Isa
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#013.md), [Isa
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#014).md). 3. A rebuke given to his
haughtiness, and a threatening of his fall and ruin, when he had served
the purposes for which God raised him up ([Isa
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012.md), [Isa
10:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#015).md). 4. A promise of grace to
the people of God, to enable them to bear up under the affliction, and
to get good by it ([Isa 10:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#020).md). 5.
Great encouragement given to them not to fear this threatening storm,
but to hope that, though for the present all the country was put into a
great consternation by it, yet it would end well, in the destruction of
this formidable enemy ([Isa 10:24-34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024).md).
And this is intended to quiet the minds of good people in reference to
all the threatening efforts of the wrath of the church's enemies. If God
be for us, who can be against us? None to do us any harm.

[Isaiah 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 10:1</span></span>

Whether they were the princes and judges of Israel of Judah, or both,
that the prophet denounced this woe against, is not certain: if those of
Israel, these verses are to be joined with the close of the foregoing
chapter, which is probable enough, because the burden of that prophecy
(for all this his anger is not turned away) is repeated here ([Isa
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#004).md); if those of Judah, they then
show what was the particular design with which God brought the Assyrian
army upon them - to punish their magistrates for mal-administration,
which they could not legally be called to account for. To them he speaks
woes before he speaks comfort to God's own people. Here is,

I. The indictment drawn up against these oppressors, [Isa
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#001.md), [Isa
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#002.md). They are charged, 1. With making
wicked laws and edicts: They decree unrighteous decrees, contrary to
natural equity and the law of God: and what mischief they prescribe
those under them write it, enrol it, and put it into the formality of a
law. "Woe to the superior powers that devise and decree these decrees!
they are not too high to be under the divine check. And woe to the
inferior officers that draw them up, and enter them upon record - the
writers that write the grievousness, they are not too mean to be within
the divine cognizance. Principal and accessaries shall fall under the
same woe." Note, It is bad to do hurt, but it is worse to do it with
design and deliberation, to do wrong to many, and to involve many in the
guilt of doing wrong. 2. With perverting justice in the execution of the
laws that were made. No people had statutes and judgments to righteous
as they had, and yet corrupt judges found ways to turn aside the needy
from judgment, to hinder them from coming at their right and recovering
what was their due, because they were needy and poor, and such as they
could get nothing by nor expect any bribes from. 3. With enriching
themselves by oppressing those that lay at their mercy, whom they ought
to have protected. They make widows' houses and estates their prey, and
they rob the fatherless of the little that is left them, because they
have no friend to appear for them. Not to relieve them if they had
wanted, not to right them if they were wronged, would have been crime
enough in men that had wealth and power; but to rob them because on the
side of the oppressors there was power, and the oppressed had no
comforter ([Ecc 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001).md), was such apiece
of barbarity as one would think none could ever be guilty of that had
either the nature of a man or the name of an Israelite.

II\. A challenge given them with all their pride and power to outface
the judgments of God ([Isa 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#003).md):
"What will you do? To whom will you flee? You can trample upon the
widows and fatherless; but what will you do when God riseth up?" [Job
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#014.md). Great men, who tyrannise over
the poor, think they shall never be called to account for their tyranny,
shall never hear of it again, or fare the worse for it; but shall not
God visit for these things? [Jer 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#029.md).
Will there not come a desolation upon those that have made others
desolate? Perhaps it may come from far, and therefore may be long in
coming; but it will come at last (reprieves are not pardons), and coming
from far, from a quarter whence it was least expected, it will be the
greater surprise and the more terrible. What will then become of these
unrighteous judges? Now they see their help in the gate ([Job
31:21](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#021).md); but to whom will they then
flee for help? Note, 1. There is a day of visitation coming, a day of
enquiry and discovery, a searching day, which will bring to light, to a
true light, every man, and every man's work. 2. The day of visitation
will be a day of desolation to all wicked people, when all their
comforts and hopes will be lost and gone, and buried in ruin, and
themselves left desolate. 3. Impenitent sinners will be utterly at a
loss, and will no know what to do in the day of visitation and
desolation. They cannot fly and hide themselves, cannot fight it out and
defend themselves; they have no refuge in which either to shelter
themselves from the present evil (to whom will you flee for help?) or to
secure to themselves better times hereafter: "Where will you leave your
glory, to find it again when the storm is over?" The wealth they had got
was their glory, and they had no place of safety in which to deposit
that, but they should certainly see it flee away. If our souls be our
glory, as they ought to be, and we make them our chief care, we know
where to leave them, and into whose hands to commit them, even those of
a faithful Creator. 4. It concerns us all seriously to consider what we
shall do in the day of visitation, in a day of affliction, in the day of
death and judgment, and to provide that we may do well.

III\. Sentence passed upon them, by which they are doomed, some to
imprisonment and captivity (they shall bow down among the prisoners, or
under them - those that were most highly elevated in sin shall be most
heavily loaded and most deeply sunk in trouble), others to death: they
shall fall first, and so shall fall under the rest of the slain. Those
that had trampled upon the widows and fatherless shall themselves be
trodden down, [Isa 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#004.md). "This it will
come to," says God, "without me, that is, because you have deserted me
and driven me away from you." Nothing but utter ruin can be expected by
those that live without God in the world, that cast him behind their
back, and so cast themselves out of his protection.

And yet, for all this, his anger is not turned away, which intimates not
only that God will proceed in his controversy with them, but that they
shall be in a continual dread of it; they shall, to their unspeakable
terror, see his hand still stretched out against them, and there shall
remain nothing but a fearful looking for of judgment.

[Isaiah 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 10:5</span></span>

The destruction of the kingdom of Israel by Shalmaneser king of Assyria
was foretold in the foregoing chapter, and it had its accomplishment in
the sixth year of Hezekiah, [Kg2
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#010.md). It was total and final, head
and tail were all cut off. Now the correction of the kingdom of Judah by
Sennacherib king of Assyria is foretold in this chapter; and this
prediction was fulfilled in the fourteenth year of Hezekiah, when that
potent prince, encouraged by the successes of his predecessor against
the ten tribes, came up against all the fenced cities of Judah and took
them, and laid siege to Jerusalem ([Kg2
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013.md), [Kg2
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017).md), in consequence of which we may
well suppose Hezekiah and his kingdom were greatly alarmed, though there
was a good work of reformation lately begun among them: but it ended
well, in the confusion of the Assyrians and the great encouragement of
Hezekiah and his people in their return to God. Now let us see here,

I. How God, in his sovereignty, deputed the king of Assyria to be his
servant, and made use of him as a mere tool to serve his own purposes
with ([Isa 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md), [Isa
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#006).md): "O Assyrian! know this, that
thou art the rod of my anger; and I will send thee to be a scourge to
the people of my wrath." Observe here, 1. How bad the character of the
Jews was, though they appeared very good. They were a hypocritical
nation, that made a profession of religion, and at this time
particularly of reformation, but were not truly religious, not truly
reformed, not so good as they pretended to be now that Hezekiah had
brought goodness into fashion. When rulers are pious, and so religion is
in reputation, it is common for nations to be hypocritical. They are a
profane nation; so some read it. Hezekiah had in a great measure cured
them of their idolatry, and now they ran into profaneness; nay,
hypocrisy is profaneness: none profane the name of God so much as those
who are called by that name and call upon it, and yet live in sin. Being
a profane hypocritical nation, they are the people of God's wrath; they
lie under his wrath, and are likely to be consumed by it. Note,
Hypocritical nations are the people of God's wrath: nothing is more
offensive to God than dissimulation in religion. See what a change sin
made: those that had been God's chosen and hallowed people, above all
people, had now become the people of his wrath. See [Amo
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#002.md). 2. How mean the character of the
Assyrian was, though he appeared very great. He was but the rod of God's
anger, an instrument God was pleased to make use of for the chastening
of his people, that, being thus chastened of the Lord, they might not be
condemned with the world. Note, The tyrants of the world are but the
tools of Providence. Men are God's hand, his sword sometimes, to kill
and slay ([Psa 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013.md), [Psa
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014).md), at other times his rod to
correct. The staff in their hand, wherewith they smite his people, is
his indignation; it is his wrath that puts the staff into their hand and
enables them to deal blows at pleasure among such as thought themselves
a match for them. Sometimes God makes an idolatrous nation, that serves
him not at all, a scourge to a hypocritical nation, that serves him not
in sincerity and truth. The Assyrian is called the rod of God's anger
because he is employed by him. (1.) From him his power is derived: I
will send him; I will give him a charge. Note, All the power that wicked
men have, though they often use it against God, they always receive from
him. Pilate could have no power against Christ unless it were given him
from above, [Joh 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#011). (2..md) By him
the exercise of that power is directed. The Assyrian is to take the
spoil and to take the prey, not to shed any blood. We read not of any
slain, but he is to plunder the country, rifle the houses, drive away
the cattle, strip the people of all their wealth and ornaments, and
tread them down like the mire of the streets. When God's professing
people wallow in the mire of sin it is just with God to suffer their
enemies to tread upon them like mire. But why must the Assyrian prevail
thus against them? Not that they might be ruined, but that they might be
thoroughly reformed.

II\. See how the king of Assyria, in his pride, magnified himself as his
own master, and pretended to be absolute and above all control, to act
purely according to his own will and for his own honour. God ordained
him for judgment, even the mighty God established him for correction
([Hab 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012).md), to be an instrument of
bringing his people to repentance, howbeit he means not so, nor does his
heart think so, [Isa 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#007.md).

1\. He does not think that he is either God's servant or Israel's
friend, either that he can do no more than God will let him or that he
shall do no more than God will make to work for the good of his people.
God designs to correct his people for, and so to cure them of, their
hypocrisy, and bring them nearer to himself; but was that Sennacherib's
design? No, it was the furthest thing from his thoughts - he means not
so. Note, (1.) The wise God often makes even the sinful passions and
projects of men subservient to his own great and holy purposes. (2.)
When God makes use of men as instruments in his hand to do his work it
is very common for him to mean one thing and them to mean another, nay,
for them to mean quite the contrary to what he intends. What Joseph's
brethren designed for hurt God overruled for good, [Gen
50:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#020.md). See [Mic
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011.md), [Mic
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#012.md). Men have their ends and God has
his, but we are sure the counsel of the Lord shall stand. But what is it
the proud Assyrian aims at? The heart of kings is unsearchable, but God
knew what was in his heart.

2\. He designs nothing but to destroy and to cut off nations not a few,
and to make himself master of them. \[1.\] He designs to gratify his own
cruelty; nothing will serve but to destroy and cut off. He hopes to
regale himself with blood and slaughter; that of particular persons will
not suffice, he must cut off nations. It is below him to deal by retail;
he traffics in murders by wholesale. Nations, and those not a few, must
have but one neck, which he will have the pleasure of cutting off.
\[2.\] He designs to gratify his own covetousness and ambition, to set
up for a universal monarch, and to gather unto him all nations, [Hab
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005.md). An insatiable desire of wealth
and dominion is that which carries him on in this undertaking.

3\. The prophet here brings him in vaunting, and hectoring; and by his
general's letter to Hezekiah, written in his name, vainglory and
arrogance seem to have entered very far into the spirit and genius of
the man. His haughtiness and presumption are here described very
largely, and his very language copied out, partly to represent him as
ridiculous and partly to assure the people of God that he would be
brought down; for that maxim generally holds true, that pride goes
before destruction. It also intimates that God takes notice, and keeps
an account, of all men's proud and haughty words, with which they set
heaven and earth at defiance. Those that speak great swelling words of
vanity shall hear of them again.

(1.) He boasts of the great things he had done to other nations. \[1.\]
He had made their kings his courtiers ([Isa
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#008).md): "My princes are altogether
kings. Those that are now my princes are such as have been kings." Or he
means that he had raised his throng to such a degree that his servants,
and those that were in command under him, were as great, and lived in as
much pomp, as the kings of other countries. Or those that were absolute
princes in their own dominions held their crowns under him, and did him
homage. This was a vainglorious boast; but how great is our God whom we
serve, who is indeed King of kings, and whose subjects are made to him
kings! [Rev 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006.md). \[2.\] He had made
himself master of their cities. He names several ([Isa
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#009).md) that were all alike reduced by
him. Calno soon yielded as Carchemish did, Hamath could not hold out any
more than Arpad, and Samaria had become his as well as Damascus. To
support his boasts he is obliged to bring the victories of his
predecessor into the account; for it was he that conquered Samaria, not
Sennacherib. \[3.\] He had been too hard for their idols, their tutelar
gods, had found out the kingdoms of the idols and found out ways to make
them his own, [Isa 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#010.md). Their
kingdoms took denomination from the idols they worshipped; the Moabites
are called the people of Chemosh ([Jer
48:46](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#046).md), because they imagined their
gods were their patrons and protectors; and therefore Sennacherib vainly
imagined that every conquest of a kingdom was the conquest of a god.
\[4.\] He had enlarged his own dominions, and removed the bounds of the
people ([Isa 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#013).md), enclosing many
large territories within the limits of his own kingdom and shifting a
great way further the ancient land-marks which his fathers had set; he
could not bear to be hemmed in so closely, but must have more room to
thrive. By his removing the border of the people Mr. White understands
his arbitrarily transplanting colonies from place to place, which was
the constant practice of the Assyrians in all their conquests; and this
is a probable interpretation. \[5.\] He had enriched himself with their
wealth, and brought it into his own exchequer: I have robbed their
treasures. In this he said truly, Great conquerors are often no better
than great robbers. \[6.\] He had mastered all the opposition he met
with: "I have put down the inhabitants as a valiant man. Those that sat
high, and thought they say firmly, I have humbled and made to come
down."

(2.) He boasts of the manner in which he had done them. \[1.\] That he
had done all this by his own policy and power ([Isa
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#013).md): "By the strength of my hand,
for I am valiant; and by my wisdom, for I am prudent;" not by the
permission of Providence and the blessing of God. He knows not that it
is God that makes him what he is, and puts the staff into his hand, but
sacrifices to his own net, [Hab 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#016.md).
"This wealth is all gotten by my might and the power of my hand," [Deu
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#017.md). Downright atheism and
profaneness, as well as pride and vanity, are at the bottom of men's
attributing their prosperity and success thus to themselves and their
own conduct, and raising their own character upon it. \[2.\] That he had
done all this with a great deal of ease, and had made but a sport and
diversion of it, as if he had been taking birds' nests ([Isa
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#014).md): my hand has found as a nest
the riches of the people; and when he had found them there was no more
difficulty in taking them than in rifling a nest, nor any more
reluctance or regret within his own breast in destroying families and
cities than in destroying crows'-nests; killing children was no more to
him than killing birds. "As one gathers the eggs that are left in the
nest by the dam, so easily have I gathered all the earth." Like
Alexander, he thought he had conquered the world; and whatever prey he
seized there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or
peeped, as birds do when their nests are rifled. They durst not make any
opposition, no, nor any complaint; such awe did they stand in of this
mighty conqueror. They were so weak that they knew it was to no purpose
to resist, and he was so arbitrary that they knew it was to no purpose
to complain. Strange that ever men who were made to do good should take
a pride and a pleasure in doing wrong, and doing mischief to all about
them without control, and should reckon that their glory which is their
shame! But their day will come to fall who thus make themselves the
terror of thy mighty, and much more of the feeble, in the land of the
living.

(3.) He threatens what he will do to Jerusalem, which he was now about
to lay siege to, [Isa 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#010.md), [Isa
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#011.md). He would master Jerusalem and
her idols, as he had subdued other places and their idols, particularly
Samaria. \[1.\] He blasphemously calls the God of Israel an idol, and
sets him on a level with the false gods of other nations, as if none
were the true God but Mithras, the sun, whom he worshipped. See how
ignorant he was, and then we shall the less wonder that he was so proud.
\[2.\] He prefers the graven images of other countries before those of
Jerusalem and Samaria, when he might have known that the worshippers of
the God of Israel were expressly forbidden to make any graven images,
and if any did it must be by stealth, and therefore they could not be so
rich and pompous as those of other nations. If he means the ark and the
mercy-seat, he speaks like himself, very foolishly, and as one that
judged by the sight of the eye, and might therefore be easily deceived
in matters of spiritual concern. Those who make external pomp and
splendour a mark of the true church go by the same rule. \[3.\] Because
he had conquered Samaria, he concluded Jerusalem would fall of course:
"Shall not I do so to Jerusalem? can I not as easily, and may I not as
justly?" But it did not follow; for Jerusalem adhered to her God,
whereas Samaria had forsaken him.

III\. See how God, in his justice, rebukes his pride and reads his doom.
We have heard what the great king, the king of Assyria, says, and how
big he talks. Let us now hear what the great God has to say by his
servant the prophet, and we shall find that, wherein he deals proudly,
God is above him.

1\. He shows the vanity of his insolent and audacious boasts ([Isa
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#015).md): Shall the axe boast itself
against him that hews therewith? or shall the saw magnify itself against
him that draws it? So absurd are the boasts of this proud man. "O what a
dust do I make!" said the fly upon the cart-wheel in the fable. "What
destruction do I make among the trees!" says the axe. Two ways the axe
may be said to boast itself against him that hews with it: - (1.) By way
of resistance and opposition. Sennacherib blasphemed God, insulted him,
threatened to serve him as he had served the gods of the nations; now
this was as if the axe should fly in the face of him that hews with it.
The tool striving with the workman is no less absurd than the clay
striving with the potter; and as it is a thing not to be justified that
men should fight against God with the wit, and wealth, and power, which
he gives them, so it is a thing not to be suffered. But if men will be
thus proud and daring, and bid defiances to all that is just and sacred,
let them expect that God will reckon with them; the more insolent they
are the surer and sorer will their ruin be. (2.) By way of rivalship and
competition. Shall the axe take to itself the praise of the work it is
employed in? So senseless, so absurd was it for Sennacherib to say, By
the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, [Isa
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#013.md). It is as if the rod, when it is
shaken, should boast that it guides the hand which shakes it; whereas,
when the staff is lifted up, is it not wood still? so the last clause
may be read. If it be an ensign of authority (as the nobles of the
people carried staves, [Num 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#018).md), if
it be an instrument of service, either to support a weak man or to
correct a bad man, still it is wood, and can do nothing but as it is
directed by him that uses it. The psalmist prays that God would make the
nations to know that they were but men ([Psa
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#020).md), the staff to know that it is
but wood

2\. He foretels his fall and ruin.

(1.) That when God had done his work by him he would then do his work
upon him, [Isa 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012.md). For the comfort
of the people of God in reference to Sennacherib's invasion, though it
was a dismal time with them, let them know, \[1.\] That God designed to
do good to Zion and Jerusalem by this providence. There is a work to be
done upon them, which God intends, and which he will perform. Note, When
God lets loose the enemies of his church and people, and suffers them
for a time to prevail, it is in order to the performing of some great
good work upon them; and, when that is done, then, and not till then, he
will work deliverance for them. When God brings his people into trouble
it is to try them ([Dan 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035).md), to
bring sin to their remembrance and humble them for it, and to awaken
them to a sense of their duty, to teach them to pray and to love and
help one another; and this must be the fruit, even the taking away of
sin, [Isa 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#009.md). When these points are,
in some measure, gained by the affliction, it shall be removed, in mercy
([Lev 26:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#041.md), [Lev
26:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#042).md), otherwise not; for, as the
word, so the rod shall accomplish that for which God sends it. \[2.\]
That when God had wrought this work of grace for his people he would
work a work of wrath and vengeance upon their invaders: I will punish
the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria. His big words are
here said to come from his stout heart, and they are the fruit of it;
for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. Notice is taken
too of the glory of his high looks, for a proud look is the indication
of a proud spirit. The enemies of the church are commonly very high and
haughty; but, sooner or later, God will reckon for their haughtiness. He
glories in it as an incontestable proof of his power and sovereignty
that he looks upon proud men and abases them, [Job
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#011.md), etc.

(2.) That, how threatening soever this attempt was upon Zion and
Jerusalem, it should certainly be baffled, and broken, and come to
nothing, and he should not be able to bring to pass his enterprise, [Isa
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#016.md), [Isa
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#019.md). Observe,

\[1.\] Who it is that undertakes his destruction, and will be the author
of it; not Hezekiah, or his princes, or the militia of Judah and
Jerusalem (what can they do against such a potent force?), but God
himself will do it, as the Lord of hosts, and as the light of Israel.
First, We are sure he can do it, for he is the Lord of hosts, of all the
hosts of heaven and earth. All the creatures are at his command; he
makes what use he pleases on them. He is the Lord of the hosts both of
Judah and of Assyria, and can give the victory to which he pleases. Let
us not fear the hosts of any enemy if we have the Lord of hosts for us.
Secondly, We have reason to hope he will do it, for he is the light of
Israel, and his Holy One. God is light; in him are perfect brightness,
purity, and happiness. He is light, for he is the Holy One; his holiness
is his glory. He is Israel's light, to direct and counsel his people, to
favour and countenance them, and so to gladden and comfort them in the
worst of times. He is their Holy One, for he is in covenant with them;
his holiness is engaged and employed for them. God's holiness is the
saints' comfort; they give thanks at the remembrance of it, and with a
great deal of pleasure call him their Holy One, [Hab
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012.md).

\[2.\] How this destruction is represented. It shall be, First, As a
consumption of the body by a disease: The Lord shall send leanness among
his fatnesses, or his fat ones. His numerous army, that was like a body
covered with fatness, shall be diminished, and waste away, and become
like a skeleton. Secondly, As a consumption of buildings, or trees and
bushes, by fire: Under his glory, that very thing which he glories in,
he will kindle a burning, as the burning of a fire, which shall lay his
army in ruins as suddenly as a raging fire lays a stately house in
ashes. Some make it an allusion to the fire kindled under the
sacrifices; for proud sinners fall as sacrifices to divine justice.
Observe, 1. How this fire shall be kindled, [Isa
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#017.md). The same God that is a
rejoicing light to those that serve him faithfully will be a consuming
fire to those that trifle with him or rebel against him. The light of
Israel shall be for a fire to the Assyrians, as the same pillar of cloud
was a light to the Israelites and a terror to the Egyptians in the Red
Sea. What can oppose, what can extinguish, such a fire? 2. What
desolation it shall make: it shall burn and devour its thorns and
briers, his officers and soldiers, which are of little worth, and
vexations to God's Israel, as thorns and briers, whose end is to be
burned, and which are easily and quickly consumed by a devouring fire.
"Who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle? They would be
so far from stopping the fire that they would inflame it. I would go
through them and burn them together ([Isa
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#004).md); they shall be devoured in one
day, all cut off in an instant." When they cried not only Peace and
safety, but Victory and triumph, then sudden destruction came; it came
surprisingly, and was completed in a little time. "Even the glory of his
forest ([Isa 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#018).md), the choice troops
of his army, the veterans, the troops of the household, the bravest
regiments he had, that he was most proud of and depended most upon, that
he valued as men do their timber-trees (the glory of their forest) or
their fruit-trees (the glory of the Carmel), shall be put as briers and
thorns before the fire; they shall be consumed both soul and body,
entirely consumed, not only a limb burned, but life taken away." Note,
God is able to destroy both soul and body, and therefore we should fear
him more than man, who can but kill the body. Great armies before him
are but as great woods, which he can fell or fire when he pleases.

\[3.\] What would be the effect of this great slaughter. The prophet
tells us, First, That the army would hereby be reduced to a very small
number: The rest of the trees of his forest shall be few; very few shall
escape the sword of the destroying angel, so few that there needs no
artist, no muster-master or secretary of war, to take an account of
them, for even a child may soon reckon the numbers of them, and write
the names of them. Secondly, That those few who remained should be quite
dispirited: They shall be as when a standard-bearer fainteth. When he
either falls or flees, and his colours are taken by the enemy, this
discourages the whole army, and puts them all into confusion. Upon the
whole matter we must say, Who is able to stand before this great and
holy Lord God?

[Isaiah 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 10:20</span></span>

The prophet had said ([Isa 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012).md) that
the Lord would perform his whole work upon Mount Zion and upon
Jerusalem, by Sennacherib's invading the land. Now here we are told what
that work should be, a twofold work: -

I. The conversion of some, to whom this providence should be sanctified
and yield the peaceable fruit of righteousness, though for the present
it was not joyous, but grievous; these are but a remnant ([Isa
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022).md), the remnant of Israel ([Isa
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#020).md), the remnant of Jacob ([Isa
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#021).md), but a very few in comparison
with the vast numbers of the people of Israel, who were as the sand of
the sea. Note, Converting work is wrought but on a remnant, who are
distinguished from the rest and set apart for God. When we see how
populous Israel is, how numerous the members of the visible church are,
as the sand of the sea, and yet consider that of these a remnant only
shall be saved, that of the many that are called there are but few
chosen, we shall surely strive to enter in at the strait gate and fear
lest we seem to come short. This remnant of Israel are said to be such
as had escaped of the house of Jacob, such as escaped the corruptions of
the house of Jacob, and kept their integrity in times of common
apostasy; and that was a fair escape. And therefore they escape the
desolations of that house, and shall be preserved in safety in times of
common calamity; and that also will be a fair and narrow escape. Their
lives shall be given them for a prey, [Jer
45:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#005.md). The righteous scarcely are
saved. Now, 1. This remnant shall come off from all confidence in an arm
of flesh, this providence shall cure them of that: "They shall no more
again stay upon him that smote them, shall never depend upon the
Assyrians, as they have done, for help against their other enemies,
finding that they are themselves their worst enemies." Ictus piscator
sapit - sufferings teach caution. "They have now learned by dear-bought
experience the folly of leaning upon that staff as a stay to them which
may perhaps prove a staff to beat them." It is part of the covenant of a
returning people ([Hos 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#003).md), Assyria
shall not save us. Note, By our afflictions we may learn not to make
creatures our confidence. 2. They shall come home to God, to the mighty
God (one of the names given to the Messiah, [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006).md), to the Holy One of Israel: "The
remnant shall return (that was signified by the name of the prophet's
son, Shear-jashub, [Isa 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003).md), even the
remnant of Jacob. They shall return, after the raising of the siege of
Jerusalem, not only to the quiet possession of their houses and lands,
but to God and to their duty; they shall repent, and pray, and seek his
face, and reform their lives." The remnant that escape are a returning
remnant: they shall return to God, and shall stay upon him. Note, Those
only may with comfort stay upon God that return to him; then may we have
a humble confidence in God when we make conscience of our duty to him.
They shall stay upon the Holy One of Israel, in truth, and not in
pretence and profession only. This promise of the conversion and
salvation of a remnant of Israel is applied by the apostle ([Rom
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#027).md) to the remnant of the Jews which
at the first preaching of the gospel received and entertained it, and
sufficiently proves that it was no new thing for God to abandon to ruin
a great many of the seed of Abraham in full force and virtue; for so it
was now. The number of the children of Israel was as the sand of the sea
(according to the promise, [Gen
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017).md), and yet only a remnant shall
be saved.

II\. The consumption of others: The Lord God of hosts shall make a
consumption, [Isa 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#023.md). This is not
meant (as that [Isa 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#018).md) of the
consumption of the Assyrian army, but of the consumption of the estates
and families of many of the Jews by the Assyrian army. This is taken
notice of to magnify the power and goodness of God in the escape of the
distinguished remnant, and to let us know what shall become of those
that will not return to God; they shall be wasted away by this
consumption, this general decay in the midst of the land. Observe, 1. It
is a consumption of God's own making; he is the author of it. The Lord
God of hosts, whom none can resist, shall make this consumption. 2. It
is decreed. It is not the product of a sudden resolve, but was before
ordained. It is determined, not only that there shall be such a
consumption, but it is cut out (so the word is); it is particularly
appointed how far it shall extend and how long it shall continue, who
shall be consumed by it and who not. 3. It is an overflowing
consumption, that shall overspread the land, and, like a mighty torrent
or inundation, bear down all before it. 4. Though it overflows, it is
not at random, but in righteousness, which signifies both wisdom and
equity. God will justly bring this consumption upon a provoking people,
but he will wisely and graciously set bounds to it. Hitherto it shall
come, and no further.

[Isaiah 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 10:24</span></span>

The prophet, in his preaching, distinguishes between the precious and
the vile; for God in his providence, even in the same providence, does
so. He speaks terror, in Sennacherib's invasion, to the hypocrites, who
were the people of God's wrath, [Isa
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#006.md). But here he speaks comfort to
the sincere, who were the people of God's love. The judgment was sent
for the sake of the former; the deliverance was wrought for the sake of
the latter. Here we have,

I. An exhortation to God's people not to be frightened at this
threatening calamity, nor to be put into any confusion or consternation
by it. Let the sinners in Zion be afraid ([Isa
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014).md): but O my people, that dwellest
in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian, [Isa
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024.md). Note, It is against the mind
and will of God that his people, whatever may happen, should give way to
that fear which has torment and amazement. Those that dwell in Zion,
where God dwells and where his people attend him, and are employed in
his service, that are under the protection of the bulwarks that are
round about Zion ([Psa 48:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#013).md), need
not be afraid of any enemy. Let their souls dwell at ease in God.

II\. Considerations offered for the silencing of their fear.

1\. The Assyrian shall do nothing against them but what God has
appointed and determined. They are here told before hand what he shall
do, that it may be no surprise to them: "He shall smite thee by the
divine permission, but it shall be only with a rod to correct thee, not
with a sword to wound and kill; nay, he shall but lift up his staff
against thee, threaten thee, and frighten thee, and shake the rod at
thee, after the manner of Egypt, as the Egyptians shook their staff
against your fathers at the Red Sea, when they said, We will pursue, we
will overtake ([Exo 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#009).md), but could
not reach to do them any hurt." Note, We should not be frightened at
those enemies that can do no more than frighten us.

2\. The storm shall soon blow over ([Isa
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#025).md): Yet a very little while - a
little, little while (so the word is), and the indignation shall cease,
even my anger, which is the staff in their hand ([Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005).md), so that when that ceases they
are disarmed and disabled to do any further mischief. Note, God's anger
against his people is but for a moment ([Psa
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#005).md), and when that ceases, and is
turned away from us, we need not fear the fury of any man, for it is
impotent passion.

3\. The enemy that threatens them shall himself be reckoned with. God's
anger against his people shall cease in the destruction of their
enemies; when he turns away his wrath from Israel he shall turn it
against the Assyrian; and the rod with which he corrected his people
shall not only be laid aside, but thrown into the fire. He lifted up his
staff against Zion, but God shall stir up a scourge for him ([Isa
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#026).md); he is a terror to God's
people, but God will be a terror to him. The destroying angel shall be
this scourge, which he can neither flee from nor contend with. The
prophet, for the encouragement of God's people, quotes precedents, and
puts them in mind of what God had done formerly against the enemies of
his church, who were very strong and formidable, but were brought to
ruin. The destruction of the Assyrian shall be, (1.) According to the
slaughter of Midian (which was effected by an invisible power, but
effected suddenly, and it was a total rout); and as, at the rock of
Oreb, one of the princes of Midian, after the battle, was slain, so
shall Sennacherib be in the temple of his god Nisroch, after the defeat
of his forces, when he thinks the bitterness of death is past. Compare
with this [Psa 83:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#011.md), Make their
nobles like Oreb and like Zeeb; and see how God's promises and his
people's prayers agree. (2.) As his rod was upon the sea, the Red Sea,
as Moses' rod was upon that, to divide it first for the escape of Israel
and then to close it again for the destruction of their pursuers, so
shall his rod now be lifted up, after the manner of Egypt, for the
deliverance of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Assyrian. Note, It
is good to observe a resemblance between God's latter and former
appearances for his people, and against his and their enemies.

4\. They shall be wholly delivered from the power of the Assyrian, and
from the fear of it, [Isa 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#027.md). "They
shall not only be eased of the Assyrian army, which is now quartered
upon them and which is a grievous yoke and burden to them, but they
shall no more pay that tribute to the king of Assyria which before this
invasion he exacted from them ([Kg2
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014).md), shall be no longer at his
service, nor lie at his mercy, as they have done; nor shall he ever
again put the country under contribution." Some think it looks further,
to the deliverance of the Jews out of their captivity in Babylon; and
further yet, to the redemption of believers from the tyranny of sin and
Satan. The yoke shall not only be taken away, but it shall be destroyed.
The enemy shall no more recover his strength, to do the mischief he has
done; and this because of the anointing, for their sakes who were
partakers of the anointing. (1.) For Hezekiah's sake, who was the
anointed of the Lord, who had been an active reformer, and was dear to
God. (2.) For David's sake. This is particularly given as the reason why
God would defend Jerusalem from Sennacherib ([Isa
37:35](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#035).md), For my own sake, and for my
servant David's sake. (3.) For his people Israel's sake, the good people
among them that had received the unction of divine grace. (4.) For the
sake of the Messiah, the Anointed of God, whom God had an eye to in all
the deliverances of the Old Testament church, and hath still an eye to
in all the favours he shows to his people. It is for his sake that the
yoke is broken, and that we are made free indeed.

III\. A description both of the terror of the enemy and the terror with
which many were struck by it, and the folly of both exposed, [Isa
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#028.md), to the end. Here observe,

1\. How formidable the Assyrians were and how daring and threatening
they affected to appear. Here is a particular description of the march
of Sennacherib, what course he steered, what swift advances he made: He
has come to Aiath, etc. "This and the other place he has made himself
master of, and has met with no opposition." At Michmash he has laid up
his carriages, as if he had no further occasion for his heavy artillery,
so easily was every place he came to reduced; or the store-cities of
Judah, which were fortified for that purpose, had now become his
magazines. Some remarkable pass, and an important one, he had taken:
They have gone over the passage.

2\. How cowardly the men of Judah were, the degenerate seed of that
lion's whelp. They were afraid; they fled upon the first alarm, and did
not offer to make any head against the enemy. Their apostasy from God
had dispirited them, so that one chased a thousand of them. Instead of a
valiant shout, to animate one another, nothing was heard by lamentation,
to discourage and weaken one another. And poor Anathoth, a priests'
city, that should have been a pattern of courage, shrieks louder than
any, [Isa 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#030.md). With respect to those
that gathered themselves together, it was not to fight, but to flee by
consent, [Isa 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#031.md). This is designed
either, (1.) To show how fast the news of the enemy's progress flew
through the kingdom: He has come to Aiath, says one; nay, says another,
He has passed to Migron, etc. And yet, perhaps, it was not altogether so
bad as common fame represented it. But we must watch against the fear,
not only of evil things, but of evil tidings, which often make things
worse than really they are, [Psa
112:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#007). Or, (2..md) To show what imminent
danger Jerusalem was in, when its enemies made so many bold advances
towards it and its friends could not make one bold stand to defend it.
Note, The more daring the church's enemies are, and the more dastardly
those are that should appear for her, the more will God be exalted in
his own strength, when, notwithstanding this, he works deliverance for
her.

3\. How impotent his attempt upon Jerusalem shall be: he shall remain at
Nob, whence he may see Mount Zion, and there he shall shake his hand
against it, [Isa 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#032.md). He shall
threaten it, and that shall be all; it shall be safe, and shall set him
at defiance. The daughter of Jerusalem, to be even with him, shall shake
her head at him, [Isa 37:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#022.md).

4\. How fatal it would prove, in the issue, to himself. When he shakes
his hand at Jerusalem, and is about to lay hands on it, then is God's
time to appear against him; for Zion is the place of which God has said,
This is my rest for ever; therefore those who threaten it affront God
himself. Then the Lord shall lop the bough with terror and cut down the
thickets of the forest, [Isa 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#033.md),
[Isa 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#034). (1..md) The pride of the
enemy shall be humbled, the boughs that are lifted up on high shall be
lopped off, the high and stately trees shall be hewn down; that is, the
haughty shall be humbled. Those that lift up themselves in competition
with God or opposition to him shall be abased. (2.) The power of the
enemy shall be broken: The thickets of the forest he shall cut down.
When the Assyrian soldiers were under their arms, and their spears
erect, they looked like a forest, like Lebanon; but, when in one night
they all became as dead corpses, the pikes were laid on the ground, and
Lebanon was of a sudden cut down by a mighty one, by the destroying
angel, who in a little time slew so many thousands of them: and, if this
shall be the exit of that proud invader, let not God's people be afraid
of him. Who art thou, that thou shouldst be afraid of a man that shall
die?
