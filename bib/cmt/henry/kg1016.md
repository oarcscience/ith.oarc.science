### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg1 16:0</span></span>

This chapter relates wholly to the kingdom of Israel, and the
revolutions of that kingdom - many in a little time. The utter ruin of
Jeroboam's family, after it had been twenty-four years a royal family,
we read of in the foregoing chapter. In this chapter we have, I. The
ruin of Baasha's family, after it had been but twenty-six years a royal
family, foretold by a prophet ([Kg1
16:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#001).md), and executed by Zimri, one of
his captains ([Kg1 16:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#008).md). II. The
seven days' reign of Zimri, and his sudden fall ([Kg1
16:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#015).md). III. The struggle between
Omri and Tibni, and Omri's prevalency, and his reign ([Kg1
16:21-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#021).md). IV. The beginning of the
reign of Ahab, of whom we shall afterwards read much ([Kg1
16:29-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#029).md). V. The rebuilding of
Jericho ([Kg1 16:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#034).md). All this while,
in Judah, things went well.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 16:1</span></span>

Here is, I. The ruin of the family of Baasha foretold. He was a man
likely enough to have raised and established his family - active,
politic, and daring; but he was an idolater, and this brought
destruction upon his family.

1\. God sent him warning of it before. (1.) That, if he were thereby
wrought upon to repent and reform, the ruin might be prevented; for God
threatens, that he may not strike, as one that desires not the death of
sinners. (2.) That, if not, it might appear that the destruction when it
did come, whoever might be instruments of it, was the act of God's
justice and the punishment of sin.

2\. The warning was sent by Jehu the son of Hanani. The father was a
seer, or prophet, at the same time ([Ch2
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#007).md), and was sent to Asa king of
Judah; but the son, who was young and more active, was sent on this
longer and more dangerous expedition to Baasha king of Israel. Juniores
ad labores - Toil and adventure are for the young. This Jehu was a
prophet and the son of a prophet. Prophecy, thus happily entailed, was
worthy of so much the more honour. This Jehu continued long in his
usefulness, for we find him reproving Jehoshaphat ([Ch2
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#002).md) above forty years after, and
writing the annals of that prince, [Ch2
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#034.md). The message which this prophet
brought to Baasha is much the same with that which Ahijah sent to
Jeroboam by his wife.

(1.) He reminds Baasha of the great things God had done for him ([Kg1
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#002).md): I exalted thee out of the dust
to the throne of glory, a great instance of the divine sovereignty and
power, [Sa1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#008.md). Baasha seemed to have
raised himself by his own treachery and cruelty, yet there was a hand of
Providence in it, to bring about God's counsel, concerning Jeroboam's
house; and God's owning his advancement as his act and deed does by no
means amount to the patronising of his ambition and treachery. It is God
that puts power into bad men's hands, which he makes to serve his good
purposes, notwithstanding the bad use they make of it. I made thee
prince over my people. God calls Israel his people still, though
wretchedly corrupted, because they retained the covenant of
circumcision, and there were many good people among them; it was not
till long after that they were called Loammi, not a people, [Hos
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#009.md).

(2.) He charges him with high crimes and misdemeanours, \[1.\] That he
had caused Israel to sin, had seduced God's subjects from their
allegiance and brought them to pay to dunghill-deities the homage due to
him only, and herein he had walked in the way of Jeroboam ([Kg1
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#002).md), and been like his house, [Kg1
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#007.md). \[2.\] That he had himself
provoked God to anger with the work of his hands, that is, by
worshipping images, the work of men's hands; though perhaps others made
them, yet he served them and thereby avowed the making of them, and they
are therefore called the work of his hands. \[3.\] That he had destroyed
the house of Jeroboam ([Kg1 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#007).md),
because he killed him, namely, Jeroboam's son and all his: if he had
done that with an eye to God, to his will and glory, and from a holy
indignation against the sins of Jeroboam and his house, he would have
been accepted and applauded as a minister of God's justice; but, as he
did it, he was only the tool of God's justice, but a servant to his own
lusts, and is justly punished for the malice and ambition which actuated
and governed him in all he did. Note, Those who are in any way employed
in denouncing or executing the justice of God (magistrates or ministers)
are concerned to do it from a good principle and in a holy manner, lest
it turn into sin to them and they make themselves obnoxious by it.

(3.) He foretels the same destruction to come upon his family which he
himself had been employed to bring upon the family of Jeroboam, [Kg1
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#003.md), [Kg1
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#004.md). Note, Those who resemble others
in their sins may expect to resemble them in their plagues, especially
those who seem zealous against such sins in others as they allow
themselves in; the house of Jehu was reckoned with for the blood of the
house of Ahab, [Hos 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#004.md).

II\. A reprieve granted for some time, so long that Baasha himself dies
in peace, and is buried with honour in his own royal city ([Kg1
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#006).md), so far is he from being a prey
either to the dogs or to the fowls, which yet was threatened to his
house, [Kg1 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#004.md). He lives not either
to see or feel the punishment threatened, yet he was himself the
greatest delinquent. Certainly there must be a future state, in which
impenitent sinners will suffer in their own persons, and not escape, as
often they do in this world. Baasha died under no visible stroke of
divine vengeance for aught that appears, but God laid up his iniquity
for his children, as Job speaks, [Job
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#019.md). Thus he often visits sin.
Observe, Baasha is punished by the destruction of his children after his
death, and his children are punished by the abuse of their bodies after
their death; that is the only thing which the threatening specifies
([Kg1 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#004).md), that the dogs and the
fowls of the air should eat them, as if herein were designed a tacit
intimation that there are punishments after death, when death has done
its worst, which will be the sorest punishments and are most to be
dreaded; these judgments on the body and posterity signified judgments
on the soul when separated from the body, by him who, after he has
killed, has power to cast into hell.

III\. Execution done at last. Baasha's son Elah, like Jeroboam's son
Nadab, reigned two years, and then was slain by Zimri, one of his own
soldiers, as Nadab was by Baasha; so like was his house made to that of
Jeroboam, as was threatened, [Kg1
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#003.md). Because his idolatry was like
his, and one of the sins for which God contended with him being the
destruction of Jeroboam's family, the more the destruction of his own
resembled that, the nearer did the punishment resemble the sin, as face
answers to face in a glass.

1\. As then, so now, the king himself was first slain, but Elah fell
more ingloriously than Nadab. Nadab was slain in the field of action and
honour, he and his army then besieging Gibbethon ([Kg1
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#027).md); but the siege being then
raised upon that disaster, and the city remaining still in the
Philistines' hands, the army of Israel was now renewing the attempt
([Kg1 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#015).md) and Elah should have been
with them to command in chief, but he loved his own ease and safety
better than his honour or duty, or the public good, and therefore staid
behind to take his pleasure; and, when he was drinking himself drunk in
his servant's house, Zimri killed him, [Kg1
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#009.md), [Kg1
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#010.md). Let it be a warning to
drunkards, especially to those who designedly drink themselves drunk,
that they know not but death may surprise them in that condition. (1.)
Death comes easily upon men when they are drunk. Besides the chronic
diseases which men frequently bring themselves into by hard drinking,
and which cut them off in the midst of their days, men in that condition
are more easily overcome by an enemy, as Amnon by Absalom, and are
liable to more bad accidents, being unable to help themselves, (2.)
Death comes terribly upon men in that condition. Finding them in the act
of sin, and incapacitated for any act of devotion, that day comes upon
them unawares ([Luk 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#034).md), like a
thief.

2\. As then, so now, the whole family was cut off, and rooted out. The
traitor was the successor, to whom the unthinking people tamely
submitted, as if it were all one to them what kind they had, so that
they had one. The first thing Zimri did was to slay all the house of
Baasha; thus he held by cruelty what he got by treason. His cruelty
seems to have extended further than Baasha's did against the house of
Jeroboam, for he left to Elah none of his kinsfolks or friends ([Kg1
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#011).md), none of his avengers (so the
word is), none that were likely to avenge his death; yet divine justice
soon avenged it so remarkably that it was used as a proverb long after,
Had Zimri peace who slew his master? [Kg2
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#031). In this, (1..md) The word of God
was fulfilled, [Kg1 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#012). (2..md) The
sins of Baasha and Elah were reckoned for, with which they provoked God
by their vanities, [Kg1 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#013.md). Their
idols are called their vanities, for they cannot profit nor help.
Miserable are those whose deities are vanities.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 16:15</span></span>

Solomon observes ([Pro 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#002).md) that for
the transgression of a land many were the princes thereof (so it was
here in Israel), but by a man of understanding the state thereof shall
be prolonged - so it was with Judah at the same time under Asa. When men
forsake God they are out of the way of rest and establishment. Zimri,
and Tibni, and Omri, are here striving for the crown. Proud aspiring men
ruin one another, and involve others in the ruin. These confusions end
in the settlement of Omri; we must therefore take him along with us
through this part of the story.

I. How he was chosen, as the Roman emperors often were, by the army in
the field, now encamped before Gibbethon. Notice was soon brought
thither that Zimri had slain their king ([Kg1
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#016).md) and set up himself in Tirzah,
the royal city, whereupon they chose Omri king in the camp, that they
might without delay avenge the death of Elah upon Zimri. Though he was
idle and intemperate, yet he was their king, and they would not tamely
submit to his murderer, nor let the treason go unpunished. They did not
attempt to avenge the death of Nadab upon Baasha, perhaps because the
house of Baasha had ruled with more gentleness than the house of
Jeroboam; but Zimri shall feel the resentments of the provoked army. The
siege of Gibbethon is quitted (Philistines are sure to gain when
Israelites quarrel) and Zimri is prosecuted.

II\. How he conquered Zimri, who is said to have reigned seven days
([Kg1 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#015).md), so long before Omri was
proclaimed king and himself proclaimed traitor; but we may suppose it
was a longer time before he died, for he continued long enough to show
his inclination to the way of Jeroboam, and to make himself obnoxious to
the justice of God by supporting his idolatry, [Kg1
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#019.md). Tirzah was a beautiful city,
but not fortified, so that Omri soon made himself master of it ([Kg1
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#017).md), forced Zimri into the palace,
which being unable to defend, and yet unwilling to surrender, he burnt,
and himself in it, [Kg1 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#018.md).
Unwilling that his rival should ever enjoy that sumptuous palace, he
burnt it; and fearing that if he fell into the hands of the army, either
alive or dead, he should be ignominiously treated, he burnt himself in
it. See what desperate practices men's wickedness sometimes brings them
to, and how it hurries them into their own ruin; see the disposition of
incendiaries, who set palaces and kingdoms on fire, though they are
themselves in danger of perishing in the flame.

III\. How he struggled with Tibni, and at length got clear of him: Half
of the people followed this Tibni ([Kg1
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#021).md), probably those who were in
Zimri's interest, with whom others joined, who would not have a king
chosen in the camp (lest he should rule by the sword and a standing
army), but in a convention of the states. The contest between these two
lasted some years, and, it is likely, cost a great deal of blood on both
sides, for it was in the twenty-seventh year of Asa that Omri was first
elected ([Kg1 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#015).md) and thence the
twelve years of his reign are to be dated; but it was not till the
thirty-first year of Asa that he began to reign without a rival; then
Tibni died, it is likely in battle, and Omri reigned, [Kg1
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#022.md). Sir Walter Raleigh, in his
History of the World (2.19.6), enquires here why it was that in all
these confusions and revolutions of the kingdom of Israel they never
thought of returning to the house of David, and uniting themselves again
to Judah, for then it was better with them than now; and he thinks the
reason was because the kings of Judah assumed a more absolute,
arbitrary, and despotic power than the kings of Israel. It was the
heaviness of the yoke that they complained of when they first revolted
from the house of David, and the dread of that made them ever after
averse to it, and attached to kings of their own, who ruled more by law
and the rules of a limited monarchy.

IV\. How he reigned when he was at length settled on the throne. 1. He
made himself famous by building Samaria, which, ever after, was the
royal city of the kings of Israel (the palace at Tirzah being burnt),
and in process of time grew so considerable that it gave name to the
middle part of Canaan (which lay between Galilee on the north and Judea
on the south) and to the inhabitants of that country, who were called
Samaritans. He bought the ground for two talents of silver, somewhat
more than 700l. of our money, for a talent was 353l. 11s. 10 1/2d.
Perhaps Shemer, who sold him the ground, let him have it considerably
the cheaper upon condition that the city should be called after his
name, for otherwise it would have borne the name of the purchaser; it
was called Samaria, or Shemeren (as it is in the Hebrew), from Shemer,
the former owner, [Kg1 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#024.md). The
kings of Israel changed their royal seats, Shechem first, then Tirzah,
now Samaria; but the kings of Judah were constant to Jerusalem, the city
of God. Those that cleave to the Lord fix, but those that leave him ever
wander. 2. He made himself infamous by his wickedness; for he did worse
than all that were before him, [Kg1
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#025.md). Though he was brought to the
throne with much difficulty, and Providence had remarkably favoured him
in his advancement, yet he was more profane, or more superstitious, and
a greater persecutor, than either of the houses of Jeroboam or Baasha.
He went further than they had done in establishing iniquity by a law,
and forcing his subjects to comply with him in it; for we read of the
statutes of Omri, the keeping of which made Israel a desolation, [Mic
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016.md). Jeroboam caused Israel to sin by
temptation, example, and allurement; but Omri did it by compulsion.

V. How he ended his reign, [Kg1 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#027.md),
[Kg1 16:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#028.md). He was in some repute for
the might which he showed. Many a bad man has been a stout man. He died
in his bed, as did Jeroboam and Baasha themselves; but, like them, left
it to his posterity to fill up the measure, and then pay off the scores,
of his iniquity.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 16:29</span></span>

We have here the beginning of the reign of Ahab, of whom we have more
particulars recorded than of any of the kings of Israel. We have here
only a general idea given us of him, as the worst of all the kings, that
we may expect what the particulars will be. He reigned twenty-two years,
long enough to do a great deal of mischief.

I. He exceeded all his predecessors in wickedness, did evil above all
that were before him ([Kg1 16:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#030).md),
and, as if it were done with a particular enmity both to God and Israel,
to affront him and ruin them, it is said, He did more purposely to
provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger, and, consequently, to send
judgments on his land, than all the kings of Israel that were before
him, [Kg1 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#033.md). It was bad with the
people when every successive king was worse than his predecessor. What
would they come to at last? He had seen the ruin of other wicked kings
and their families; yet, instead of taking warning, his heart was
hardened and enraged against God by it. He thought it a light thing to
walk in the sins of Jeroboam, [Kg1
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#031.md). It was nothing to break the
second commandment by image-worship, he would set aside the first also
by introducing other gods; his little finger should fall heavier upon
God's ordinances than Jeroboam's loins. Making light of less sins makes
way for greater, and those that endeavour to extenuate other people's
sins will but aggravate their own.

II\. He married a wicked woman, who he knew would bring in the worship
of Baal, and seemed to marry her with that design. As if it had been a
light thing to walk in the sins of Jeroboam, he took to wife Jezebel
([Kg1 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#031).md), a zealous idolater,
extremely imperious and malicious in her natural temper, addicted to
witchcrafts and whoredoms ([Kg2 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#022).md),
and every way vicious. The false prophetess spoken of [Rev
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#020.md) is there called Jezebel, for a
wicked woman could not be called by a worse name than hers; what
mischiefs she did, and what mischief at last befel her ([Kg2
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#033).md), we shall find in the following
story; this one strange wife debauched Israel more than all the strange
wives of Solomon.

III\. He set up the worship of Baal, forsook the God of Israel and
served the god of the Sidonians, Jupiter instead of Jehovah, the sun (so
some think), a deified hero of the Phoenicians (so others): he was weary
of the golden calves, and thought they had been worshipped long enough;
such vanities were they that those who had been fondest of them at
length grew sick of them, and, like adulterers, much have variety. In
honour of this mock deity, whom they called Baal - lord, and for the
convenience of his worship, 1. Ahab built a temple in Samaria, the royal
city, because the temple of God was in Jerusalem, the royal city of the
other kingdom. He would have Baal's temple near him, that he might the
better frequent it, protect it, and put honour upon it. 2. He reared an
altar in that temple, on which to offer sacrifice to Baal, by which they
acknowledged their dependence upon him and sought his favour. O the
stupidity of idolaters, who are at a great expense to make one their
friend whom they might have chosen whether they would make a god of or
no! 3. He made a grove about his temple, either a natural one, by
planting shady trees there, or, if those would be too long in growing,
an artificial one in imitation of it; for it is not said he planted, but
he made a grove, something that answered the intention, which was to
conceal and so countenance the abominable impurities that were committed
in the filthy worship of Baal. Lucus, lucendo, quia non lucet - He that
doeth evil hateth the light.

IV\. One of his subjects, in imitation of his presumption, ventured to
build Jericho, in defiance of the curse Joshua had long since pronounced
on him that should attempt it, [Kg1
16:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#034.md). It comes in as an instance of
the height of impiety to which men had arrived, especially at Bethel,
where one of the calves was, for of that city this daring sinner was.
Observe, 1. How ill he did. Like Achan he meddled with the accursed
thing, turned that to his own use which was devoted to God's honour. He
began to build, in defiance of the curse well known in Israel, jesting
with it perhaps as a bugbear, or fancying its force worn out by length
of time, for it was above 500 years since it was pronounced, [Jos
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#026.md). He went on to build, in defiance
of the execution of the curse in part; for, though his eldest son died
when he began, yet he would proceed in contempt of God and his wrath
revealed from heaven against his ungodliness. 2. How ill he sped. He
built for his children, but God wrote him childless; his eldest son died
when he began, the youngest when he finished, and all the rest (it is
supposed) between. Note, Those whom God curses are cursed indeed; none
ever hardened his heart against God and prospered. God keep us back from
presumptuous sins, those great transgressions!
