### [Psalms Chapter 65](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 65:0</span></span>

In this psalm we are directed to give to God the glory of his power and
goodness, which appear, I. In the kingdom of grace ([Psa
65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001).md), hearing prayer ([Psa
65:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#002).md), pardoning sin ([Psa
65:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#003).md), satisfying the souls of the
people ([Psa 65:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#004).md), protecting and
supporting them ([Psa 65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005).md). II. In
the kingdom of Providence, fixing the mountains ([Psa
65:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#006).md), calming the sea ([Psa
65:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#007).md), preserving the regular
succession of day and night ([Psa
65:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#008).md), and making the earth fruitful
([Psa 65:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009).md). These are blessings we
are all indebted to God for, and therefore we may easily accommodate
this psalm to ourselves in singing it.

To the chief musician. A psalm and song of David.

[Psalms 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 65:1</span></span>

The psalmist here has no particular concern of his own at the throne of
grace, but begins with an address to God, as the master of an assembly
and the mouth of a congregation; and observe,

I. How he gives glory to God, [Psa
65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001.md). 1. By humble thankfulness:
Praise waiteth for thee, O God! in Zion, waits till it arrives, that it
may be received with thankfulness at its first approach. When God is
coming towards us with his favours we must go forth to meet him with our
praises, and wait till the day dawn. "Praise waits, with an entire
satisfaction in thy holy will and dependence on thy mercy." When we
stand ready in every thing to give thanks, then praise waits for God.
"Praise waits thy acceptance" the Levites by night stood in the house of
the Lord, ready to sing their songs of praise at the hour appointed
([Psa 134:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001.md), [Psa
134:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#002).md), and thus their praise waited
for him. Praise is silent unto thee (so the word is), as wanting words
to express the great goodness of God, and being struck with a silent
admiration at it. As there are holy groanings which cannot be uttered,
so there are holy adorings which cannot be uttered, and yet shall be
accepted by him that searches the heart and knows what is the mind of
the spirit. Our praise is silent, that the praises of the blessed
angels, who excel in strength, may be heard. Let it not be told him that
I speak, for if a man offer to speak forth all God's praise surely he
shall be swallowed up, [Job 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#020.md).
Before thee praise is reputed as silence (so the Chaldee), so far
exalted is God above all our blessing and praise. Praise is due to God
from all the world, but it waits for him in Zion only, in his church,
among his people. All his works praise him (they minister matter for
praise), but only his saints bless him by actual adorations. The
redeemed church sing their new song upon Mount Zion, [Rev
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001.md), [Rev
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#003.md). In Zion was God's
dwelling-place, [Psa 76:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#002.md). Happy are
those who dwell with him there, for they will be still praising him. 2.
By sincere faithfulness: Unto thee shall the vow be performed, that is,
the sacrifice shall be offered up which was vowed. We shall not be
accepted in our thanksgivings to God for the mercies we have received
unless we make conscience of paying the vows which we made when we were
in pursuit of the mercy; for better it is not to vow than to vow and not
to pay.

II\. What he gives him glory for.

1\. For hearing prayer ([Psa 65:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#002).md):
Praise waits for thee; and why is it so ready? (1.) "Because thou art
ready to grant our petitions. O thou that hearest prayer! thou canst
answer every prayer, for thou art able to do for us more than we are
able to ask or think ([Eph 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020).md), and
thou wilt answer every prayer of faith, either in kind or kindness." It
is much for the glory of God's goodness, and the encouragement of ours,
that he is a God hearing prayer, and has taken it among the titles of
his honour to be so; and we are much wanting to ourselves if we do not
take all occasions to give him his title. (2.) Because, for that reason,
we are ready to run to him when we are in our straits. "Therefore,
because thou art a God hearing prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come;
justly does every man's praise wait for thee, because every man's prayer
waits on thee when he is in want or distress, whatever he does at other
times. Now only the seed of Israel come to thee, and the proselytes to
their religion; but, when thy house shall be called a house of prayer to
all people, then unto thee shall all flesh come, and be welcome," [Rom
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#012.md), [Rom
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#013.md). To him let us come, and come
boldly, because he is a God that hears prayer.

2\. For pardoning sin. In this who is a God like unto him? [Mic
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018.md). By this he proclaims his name
([Exo 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#007).md), and therefore, upon this
account, praise waits for him, [Psa
65:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#003.md). "Our sins reach to the heavens,
iniquities prevail against us, and appear so numerous, so heinous, that
when they are set in order before us we are full of confusion and ready
to fall into despair. They prevail so against us that we cannot pretend
to balance them with any righteousness of our own, so that when we
appear before God our own consciences accuse us and we have no reply to
make; and yet, as for our transgressions, thou shalt, of thy own free
mercy and for the sake of a righteousness of thy own providing, purge
them away, so that we shall not come into condemnation for them." Note,
The greater our danger is by reason of sin the more cause we have to
admire the power and riches of God's pardoning mercy, which can
invalidate the threatening force of our manifold transgressions and our
mighty sins.

3\. For the kind entertainment he gives to those that attend upon him
and the comfort they have in communion with him. Iniquity must first be
purged away ([Psa 65:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#003).md) and then we
are welcome to compass God's altars, [Psa
65:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#004.md). Those that come into communion
with God shall certainly find true happiness and full satisfaction in
that communion.

(1.) They are blessed. Not only blessed is the nation ([Psa
33:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#012).md), but blessed is the man, the
particular person, how mean soever, whom thou choosest, and causest to
approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts; he is a happy man,
for he has the surest token of the divine favour and the surest pledge
and earnest of everlasting bliss. Observe here, \[1.\] What it is to
come into communion with God, in order to this blessedness. First, It is
to approach to him by laying hold on his covenant, setting our best
affections upon him, and letting out our desires towards him; it is to
converse with him as one we love and value. Secondly, It is to dwell in
his courts, as the priests and Levites did, that were at home in God's
house; it is to be constant in the exercises of religion, and apply
ourselves closely to them as we do to that which is the business of our
dwelling-place. \[2.\] How we come into communion with God, not
recommended by any merit of our own, nor brought in by any management of
our own, but by God's free choice: "Blessed is the man whom thou
choosest, and so distinguishest from others who are left to themselves;"
and it is by his effectual special grace pursuant to that choice; whom
he chooses he causes to approach, not only invites them, but inclines
and enables them, to draw nigh to him. He draws them, [Joh
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044.md).

(2.) They shall be satisfied. Here the psalmist changes the person, not,
He shall be satisfied (the man whom thou choosest), but, We shall, which
teaches us to apply the promises to ourselves and by an active faith to
put our own names into them: We shall be satisfied with the goodness of
thy house, even of thy holy temple. Note, \[1.\] God's holy temple is
his house; there he dwells, where his ordinances are administered.
\[2.\] God keeps a good house. There is abundance of goodness in his
house, righteousness, grace, and all the comforts of the everlasting
covenant; there is enough for all, enough for each; it is ready, always
ready; and all on free cost, without money and without price. \[3.\] In
those things there is that which is satisfying to a soul, and with which
all gracious souls will be satisfied. Let them have the pleasure of
communion with God, and that suffices them; they have enough, they
desire no more.

4\. For the glorious operations of his power on their behalf ([Psa
65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005).md): By terrible things in
righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation! This may be
understood of the rebukes which God in his providence sometimes gives to
his own people; he often answers them by terrible things, for the
awakening and quickening of them, but always in righteousness; he
neither does them any wrong nor means them any hurt, for even then he is
the God of their salvation. See [Isa
45:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#015.md). But it is rather to be
understood of his judgments upon their enemies; God answers his people's
prayers by the destructions made, for their sakes, among the heathen,
and the recompence he renders to their proud oppressors, as a righteous
God, the God to whom vengeance belongs, and as the God that protects and
saves his people. By wonderful things (so some read it), things which
are very surprising, and which we looked not for, [Isa
64:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#003.md). Or, "By things which strike an
awe upon us thou wilt answer us." The holy freedom that we are admitted
to in God's courts, and the nearness of our approach to him, must not at
all abate our reverence and godly fear of him; for he is terrible in his
holy places.

5\. For the care he takes of all his people, however distressed, and
whithersoever dispersed. He is the confidence of all the ends of the
earth that is, of all the saints all the world over and not theirs only
that were of the seed of Israel; for he is the God of the Gentiles as
well as of the Jews, the confidence of those that are afar off from his
holy temple and its courts, that dwell in the islands of the Gentiles,
or that are in distress upon the sea. They trust in thee, and cry to
thee, when they are at their wits' end, [Psa
107:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#027.md), [Psa
107:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#028.md). By faith and prayer we may
keep up our communion with God, and fetch in comfort from him, wherever
we are, not only in the solemn assemblies of his people, but also afar
off upon the sea.

[Psalms 65:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 65:6</span></span>

That we may be the more affected with the wonderful condescensions of
the God of grace, it is of use to observe his power and sovereignty as
the God of nature, the riches and bounty of his providential kingdom.

I. He establishes the earth and it abides, [Psa
119:90](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#090.md). By his own strength he setteth
fast the mountains ([Psa 65:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#006).md), did
set them fast at first and still keeps them firm, though they are
sometimes shaken by earthquakes.

\- Feriuntque summos. Fulmina montes.

The lightning blasts and loftiest hills.

Hence they are called everlasting mountains, [Hab
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#006.md). yet God's covenant with his
people is said to stand more firmly than they, [Isa
54:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#010.md).

II\. He stills the sea, and it is quiet, [Psa
65:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#007.md). The sea in a storm makes a great
noise, which adds to its threatening terror; but, when God pleases, he
commands silence among the waves and billows, and lays them to sleep,
turns the storm into a calm quickly, [Psa
107:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#029.md). And by this change in the sea,
as well as by the former instance of the unchangeableness of the earth,
it appears that he whose the sea and the dry land are is girded with
power. And by this our Lord Jesus gave a proof of his divine power, that
he commanded the winds and waves, and they obeyed him. To this instance
of the quieting of the sea he adds, as a thing much of the same nature,
that he stills the tumult of the people, the common people. Nothing is
more unruly and disagreeable than the insurrections of the mob, the
insults of the rabble; yet even these God can pacify, in secret ways,
which they themselves are not aware of. Or it may be meant of the
outrage of the people that were enemies to Israel, [Psa
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md). God has many ways to still them
and will for ever silence their tumults.

III\. He renews the morning and evening, and their revolution is
constant, [Psa 65:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#008.md). This regular
succession of day and night may be considered, 1. As an instance of
God's great power, and so it strikes an awe upon all: Those that dwell
in the uttermost parts of the earth are afraid at thy signs or tokens;
they are by them convinced that there is a supreme deity, a sovereign
monarch, before whom they ought to fear and tremble; for in these things
the invisible things of God are clearly seen; and therefore they are
said to be set for signs, [Gen 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#014.md).
Many of those that dwell in the remote and dark corners of the earth
were so afraid at these tokens that they were driven to worship them
([Deu 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019).md), not considering that they
were God's tokens, undeniable proofs of his power and godhead, and
therefore they should have been led by them to worship him. 2. As an
instance of God's great goodness, and so it brings comfort to all: Thou
makest the outgoings of the morning, before the sun rises, and of the
evening, before the sun sets, to rejoice. As it is God that scatters the
light of the morning and draws the curtains of the evening, so he does
both in favour to man, and makes both to rejoice, gives occasion to us
to rejoice in both; so that how contrary soever light and darkness are
to each other, and how inviolable soever the partition between them
([Gen 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#004).md), both are equally welcome
to the world in their season. It is hard to say which is more welcome to
us, the light of the morning, which befriends the business of the day,
or the shadows of the evening, which befriend the repose of the night.
Does the watchman wait for the morning? So does the hireling earnestly
desire the shadow. Some understand it of the morning and evening
sacrifice, which good people greatly rejoiced in and in which God was
constantly honoured. Thou makest them to sing (so the word is); for
every morning and every evening songs of praise were sung by the
Levites; it was that which the duty of every day required. We are to
look upon our daily worship, alone and with our families, to be both the
most needful of our daily occupations and the most delightful of our
daily comforts; and, if therein we keep up our communion with God, the
outgoings both of the morning and of the evening are thereby made truly
to rejoice.

IV\. He waters the earth and makes it fruitful. On this instance of
God's power and goodness he enlarges very much, the psalm being probably
penned upon occasion either of a more than ordinarily plentiful harvest
or of a seasonable rain after long drought. How much the fruitfulness of
this lower part of the creation depends upon the influence of the upper
is easy to observe; if the heavens be as brass, the earth is as iron,
which is a sensible intimation to a stupid world that every good and
perfect gift is from above, omnia desuper - all from above; we must lift
up our eyes above the hills, lift them up to the heavens, where the
original springs of all blessings are, out of sight, and thither must
our praises return, as the first-fruits of the earth were in the
heave-offerings lifted up towards heaven by way of acknowledgment that
thence they were derived. All God's blessings, even spiritual ones, are
expressed by his raining righteousness upon us. Now observe how the
common blessing of rain from heaven and fruitful seasons is here
described.

1\. How much there is in it of the power and goodness of God, which is
here set forth by a great variety of lively expressions. (1.) God that
made the earth hereby visits it, sends to it, gives proof of his care of
it, [Psa 65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009.md). It is a visit in mercy,
which the inhabitants of the earth ought to return in praises. (2.) God,
that made it dry land, hereby waters it, in order to its fruitfulness.
Though the productions of the earth flourished before God had caused it
to rain, yet even then there was a mist which answered the intention,
and watered the whole face of the ground, [Gen
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#005.md), [Gen
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#006.md). Our hearts are dry and barren
unless God himself be as the dew to us and water us; and the plants of
his own planting he will water and make them to increase. (3.) Rain is
the river of God, which is full of water; the clouds are the springs of
this river, which do not flow at random, but in the channel which God
cuts out for it. The showers of rain, as the rivers of water, he turns
which way soever he pleases. (4.) This river of God enriches the earth,
which without it would quickly be a poor thing. The riches of the earth,
which are produced out of its surface, are abundantly more useful and
serviceable to man than those which are hidden in its bowels; we might
live well enough without silver and gold, but not without corn and
grass.

2\. How much benefit is derived from it to the earth and to man upon it.
(1.) To the earth itself. The rain in season gives it a new face;
nothing is more reviving, more refreshing, than the rain upon the
new-mown grass, [Psa 72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006.md). Even the
ridges of the earth, off which the rain seems to slide, are watered
abundantly, for they drink in the rain which comes often upon them; the
furrows of it, which are turned up by the plough, in order to the
seedness, are settled by the rain and made fit to receive the seed ([Psa
65:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#010).md); they are settled by being made
soft. That which makes the soil of the heart tender settles it; for the
heart is established with that grace. Thus the springing of the year is
blessed; and if the spring, that first quarter of the year, be blessed,
that is an earnest of a blessing upon the whole year, which God is
therefore said to crown with his goodness ([Psa
65:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#011).md), to compass it on every side as
the head is compassed with a crown, and to complete the comforts of it
as the end of a thing is said to crown it. And his paths are said to
drop fatness; for whatever fatness there is in the earth, which
impregnates its productions, it comes from the out-goings of the divine
goodness. Wherever God goes he leaves the tokens of his mercy behind him
([Joe 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#013.md), [Joe
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#014).md) and makes his path thus to shine
after him. These communications of God's goodness to this lower world
are very extensive and diffusive ([Psa
65:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#012).md): They drop upon the pastures of
the wilderness, and not merely upon the pastures of the inhabited land.
The deserts, which man takes no care of and receives no profit from, are
under the care of the divine Providence, and the profits of them redound
to the glory of God, as the great benefactor of the whole creation,
though not immediately to the benefit of man; and we ought to be
thankful not only for that which serves us, but for that which serves
any part of the creation, because thereby it turns to the honour of the
Creator. The wilderness, which makes not such returns as the cultivated
grounds do, receives as much of the rain of heaven as the most fruitful
soil; for God does good to the evil and unthankful. So extensive are the
gifts of God's bounty that in them the hills, the little hills, rejoice
on every side, even the north side, that lies most from the sun. Hills
are not above the need of God's providence; little hills are not below
the cognizance of it. But as, when he pleases, he can make them tremble
([Psa 114:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#006).md), so when he pleases he
can make them rejoice. (2.) To man upon the earth. God, by providing
rain for the earth, prepares corn for man, [Psa
65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009.md). As for the earth, out of it
comes bread ([Job 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#005).md), for out of it
comes corn; but every grain of corn that comes out of it God himself
prepared; and therefore he provides rain for the earth, that thereby he
may prepare corn for man, under whose feet he has put the rest of the
creatures and for whose use he has fitted them. When we consider that
the yearly produce of the corn is not only an operation of the same
power that raises the dead, but an instance of that power not much
unlike it (as appears by that of our Saviour, [Joh
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024).md), and that the constant benefit
we have from it is an instance of that goodness which endures for ever,
we shall have reason to think that it is no less than a God that
prepares corn for us. Corn and cattle are the two staple commodities
with which the husbandman, who deals immediately in the fruits of the
earth, is enriched; and both are owing to the divine goodness in
watering the earth, [Psa 65:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#013.md). To
this it is owing that the pastures are clothed with flocks, [Psa
65:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#013.md). So well stocked are the
pastures that they seem to be covered over with the cattle that are laid
in them, and yet the pasture not overcharged; so well fed are the cattle
that they are the ornament and the glory of the pastures in which they
are fed. The valleys are so fruitful that they seem to be covered over
with corn, in the time of harvest. The lowest parts of the earth are
commonly the most fruitful, and one acre of the humble valleys is worth
five of the lofty mountains. But both corn-ground and pasture-ground,
answering the end of their creation, are said to shout for joy and sin,
because they are serviceable to the honour of God and the comfort of
man, and because they furnish us with matter for joy and praise: as
there is no earthly joy above the joy of harvest, so there was none of
the feasts of the Lord, among the Jews, solemnized with greater
expressions of thankfulness than the feast of in-gathering at the end of
the year, [Exo 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#016.md). Let all these
common gifts of the divine bounty, which we yearly and daily partake of,
increase our love to God as the best of beings, and engage us to glorify
him with our bodies, which he thus provides so well for.
