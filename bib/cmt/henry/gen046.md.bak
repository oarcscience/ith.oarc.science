### [Genesis Chapter 46](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 46:0</span></span>

Jacob is here removing to Egypt in his old age, forced thither by a
famine, and invited thither by a son. Here, I. God sends him thither
([Gen 46:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#001).md). II. All his family goes
with him (v. 5-27). III. Joseph bids him welcome ([Gen
46:28-34](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#028).md).

[Genesis 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 46:1</span></span>

The divine precept is, In all thy ways acknowledge God; and the promise
annexed to it is, He shall direct thy paths. Jacob has here a very great
concern before him, not only a journey, but a removal, to settle in
another country, a change which was very surprising to him (for he never
had any other thoughts than to live and die in Canaan), and which would
be of great consequence to his family for a long time to come. Now here
we are told,

I. How he acknowledged God in this way. He came to Beersheba, from
Hebron, where he now dwelt; and there he offered sacrifices to the God
of his father Isaac, [Gen 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#001.md). He
chose that place, in remembrance of the communion which his father and
grandfather had with God in that place. Abraham called on God there
([Gen 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#033).md), so did Isaac ([Gen
26:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#025).md), and therefore Jacob made it
the place of his devotion, the rather because it lay in his way. In his
devotion, 1. He had an eye to God as the God of his father Isaac, that
is, a God in covenant with him; for by Isaac the covenant was entailed
upon him. God had forbidden Isaac to go down to Egypt when there was a
famine in Canaan ([Gen 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#002).md), which
perhaps Jacob calls to mind when he consults God as the God of his
father Isaac, with this thought, "Lord, though I am very desirous to see
Joseph, yet if thou forbid me to go down to Egypt, as thou didst my
father Isaac, I will submit, and very contentedly stay where I am." 2.
He offered sacrifices, extraordinary sacrifices, besides those at his
stated times; these sacrifices were offered, (1.) By way of thanksgiving
for the late blessed change of the face of his family, for the good news
he had received concerning Joseph, and for the hopes he had of seeing
him. Note, We should give God thanks for the beginnings of mercy, though
they are not yet perfected; and this is a decent way of begging further
mercy. (2.) By way of petition for the presence of God with him in his
intended journey; he desired by these sacrifices to make his peace with
God, to obtain the forgiveness of sin, that he might take no guilt along
with him in this journey, for that is a bad companion. By Christ, the
great sacrifice, we must reconcile ourselves to God, and offer up our
requests to him. (3.) By way of consultation. The heathen consulted
their oracles by sacrifice. Jacob would not go till he had asked God's
leave: "Shall I go down to Egypt, or back to Hebron?" Such must be our
enquiries in doubtful cases; and, though we cannot expect immediate
answers from heaven, yet, if we diligently attend to the directions of
the word, conscience, and providence, we shall find it is not in vain to
ask counsel of God.

II\. How God directed his paths: In the visions of the night (probably
the very next night after he had offered his sacrifices, as [Ch2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#007).md) God spoke unto him, [Gen
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#002.md). Note, Those who desire to keep
up communion with God shall find that it never fails on his side. If we
speak to him as we ought, he will not fail to speak to us. God called
him by name, by his old name, Jacob, Jacob, to remind him of his low
estate; his present fears did scarcely become an Israel. Jacob, like one
well acquainted with the visions of the Almighty, and ready to obey
them, answers, "Here I am, ready to receive orders:" and what has God to
say to him?

1\. He renews the covenant with him: I am God, the God of thy father
([Gen 46:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#003).md); that is, "I am what thou
ownest me to be: thou shalt find me a God, a divine wisdom and power
engaged for thee; and thou shalt find me the God of thy father, true to
the covenant made with him."

2\. He encourages him to make this removal of his family: Fear not to go
down into Egypt. It seems, though Jacob, upon the first intelligence of
Joseph's life and glory in Egypt, resolved, without any hesitation, I
will go and see him; yet, upon second thoughts, he saw some difficulties
in it, which he knew not well how to get over. Note, Even those changes
that seem to have in them the greatest joys and hopes, yet have an alloy
of cares and fears, Nulla est sincera voluptas - There is no unmingled
pleasure. We must always rejoice with trembling. Jacob had many careful
thoughts about this journey, which God took notice of. (1.) He was old,
130 years old; and it is mentioned as one of the infirmities of old
people that they are afraid of that which is high, and fears are in the
way, [Ecc 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#005.md). It was a long journey,
and Jacob was unfit for travel, and perhaps remembered that his beloved
Rachel died in a journey. (2.) He feared lest his sons should be tainted
with the idolatry of Egypt, and forget the God of their fathers, or
enamoured with the pleasures of Egypt, and forget the land of promise.
(3.) Probably he thought of what God had said to Abraham concerning the
bondage and affliction of his seed ([Gen
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013).md), and was apprehensive that his
removal to Egypt would issue in that. Present satisfactions should not
take us off from the consideration and prospect of future
inconveniences, which possibly may arise from what now appears most
promising. (4.) He could not think of laying his bones in Egypt. But,
whatever his discouragements were, this was enough to answer them all,
Fear not to go down into Egypt.

3\. He promises him comfort in the removal. (1.) That he should multiply
in Egypt: "I will there, where thou fearest that thy family will sink
and be lost, make it a great nation. That is the place Infinite Wisdom
has chosen for the accomplishment of that promise." (2.) That he should
have God's presence with him: I will go down with thee into Egypt. Note,
Those that go whither God sends them shall certainly have God with them,
and that is enough to secure them wherever they are and to silence their
fears; we may safely venture even into Egypt if God go down with us.
(3.) That neither he nor his should be lost in Egypt: I will surely
bring thee up again. Though Jacob died in Egypt, yet this promise was
fulfilled, \[1.\] In the bringing up of his body, to be buried in
Canaan, about which, it appears, he was very solicitous, [Gen
49:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#029.md), [Gen
49:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#032.md). \[2.\] In the bringing up of
his seed to be settled in Canaan. Whatever low or darksome valley we are
called into at any time, we may be confident, if God go down with us
into it, that he will surely bring us up again. If he go with us down to
death, he will surely bring us up again to glory. (4.) That living and
dying, his beloved Joseph should be a comfort to him: Joseph shall put
his hand upon thine eyes. This is a promise that Joseph should live as
long as he lived, that he should be with him at his death, and close his
eyes with all possible tenderness and respect, as the dearest relations
used to do. Probably Jacob, in the multitude of this thought within him,
had been wishing that Joseph might do this last office of love for him:
Ille meos oculos comprimat - Let him close my eyes; and God thus
answered him in the letter of his desire. Thus God sometimes gratifies
the innocent wishes of his people, and makes not only their death happy,
but the very circumstances of it agreeable.

[Genesis 46:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 46:5</span></span>

Old Jacob is here flitting. Little did he think of ever leaving Canaan;
he expected, no doubt, to die in his nest, and to leave his seed in
actual possession of the promised land: but Providence orders it
otherwise. Note, Those that think themselves well settled may yet be
unsettled in a little time. Even old people, who think of no other
removal than that to the grave (which Jacob had much upon his heart,
[Gen 37:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#035.md); [Gen
42:38](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#038).md), sometimes live to see great
changes in their family. It is good to be ready, not only for the grave,
but for whatever may happen betwixt us and the grave. Observe, 1. How
Jacob was conveyed; not in a chariot, though chariots were then used,
but in a wagon, [Gen 46:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#005.md). Jacob had
the character of a plain man, who did not affect any thing stately or
magnificent; his son rode in a chariot ([Gen
41:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#043).md), but a wagon would serve him.
2. The removal of what he had with him. (1.) His effects ([Gen
46:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#006).md), cattle and goods; these he took
with him that he might not wholly be beholden to Pharaoh for a
livelihood, and that it might not afterwards be said of them, "that they
came beggars to Egypt." (2.) His family, all his seed, [Gen
46:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#007.md). It is probable that they had
continued to live together in common with their father; and therefore
when he went they all went, which perhaps they were the more willing to
do, because, though they had heard that the land of Canaan was promised
them, yet, to this day, they had none of it in possession. We have here
a particular account of the names of Jacob's family, his sons' sons,
most of whom are afterwards mentioned as heads of houses in the several
tribes. See [Num 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#005.md), etc. Bishop
Patrick observes that Issachar called his eldest son Tola, which
signifies a worm, probably because when he was born he was a very little
weak child, a worm, and no man, not likely to live; and yet there sprang
from him a very numerous offspring, [Ch1
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#002.md). Note, Living and dying do not go
by probability. The whole number that went down into Egypt was sixty-six
([Gen 46:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#026).md), to which add Joseph and
his two sons, who were there before, and Jacob himself, the head of the
family, and you have the number of seventy, [Gen
46:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#027.md). The Septuagint makes them
seventy-five, and Stephen follows them ([Act
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#014).md), the reason of which we leave to
the conjecture of the critics; but let us observe, \[1.\] Masters of
families ought to take care of all under their charge, and to provide
for those of their own house food convenient both for body and soul.
When Jacob himself removed to a land of plenty, he would not leave any
of his children behind him to starve in a barren land. \[2.\] Though the
accomplishment of promises is always sure, yet it is often slow. It was
now 215 years since God had promised Abraham to make of him a great
nation ([Gen 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002).md); and yet that
branch of his seed on which the promise was entailed had increased only
to seventy, of which this particular account is kept, that the power of
God in multiplying these seventy to so vast a multitude, even in Egypt,
may appear the more illustrious. When God pleases, a little one shall
become a thousand, [Isa 60:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#022.md).

[Genesis 46:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 46:28</span></span>

We have here, I. The joyful meeting between Jacob and his son Joseph, in
which observe,

1\. Jacob's prudence in sending Judah before him to Joseph, to give him
notice of his arrival in Goshen. This was a piece of respect owing to
the government, under the protection of which these strangers had come
to put themselves, [Gen 46:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#028.md). We
should be very careful not to give offence to any, especially not to the
higher powers.

2\. Joseph's filial respect to him. He went in his chariot to met him,
and, in the interview, showed, (1.) How much he honoured him: He
presented himself unto him. Note, It is the duty of children to
reverence their parents, yea, though Providence, as to outward
condition, has advanced them above their parents. (2.) How much he loved
him. Time did not wear out the sense of his obligations, but his tears
which he shed abundantly upon his father's neck, for joy to see him,
were real indications of the sincere and strong affection he had for
him. See how near sorrow and joy are to each other in this world, when
tears serve for the expression of both. In the other world weeping will
be restrained to sorrow only; in heaven there is perfect joy, but no
tears of joy: all tears, even those, shall there be wiped away, because
the joys there are, as no joys are here, without any alloy. When Joseph
embraced Benjamin he wept upon his neck, but when he embraced his father
he wept upon his neck a good while; his brother Benjamin was dear, but
his father Jacob must be dearer.

3\. Jacob's great satisfaction in this meeting: Now let me die, [Gen
46:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#030.md). Not but that it was further
desirable to live with Joseph, and to see his honour and usefulness; but
he had so much pleasure and satisfaction in this first meeting that he
thought it too much to desire or expect any more in this world, where
our comforts must always be imperfect. Jacob wished to die immediately,
and lived seventeen years longer, which, as our lives go now, is a
considerable part of a man's age. Note, Death will not always come just
when we call for it, whether in a passion of sorrow or in a passion of
joy. Our times are in God's hand, and not in our own; we must die just
when God pleases, and not either just when we are surfeited with the
pleasures of life or just when we are overwhelmed with its griefs.

II\. Joseph's prudent care concerning his brethren's settlement. It was
justice to Pharaoh to let him know that such a colony had come to settle
in his dominions. Note, If others repose a confidence in us, we must not
be so base and disingenuous as to abuse it by imposing upon them. If
Jacob and his family should come to be a charge to the Egyptians, yet it
should never be said that they came among them clandestinely and by
stealth. Thus Joseph took care to pay his respects to Pharaoh, [Gen
46:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#031.md). But how shall he dispose of his
brethren? Time was when they were contriving to get rid of him; now he
is contriving to settle them to their satisfaction and advantage: This
is rendering good for evil. Now, 1. He would have them to live by
themselves, separate as much as might be from the Egyptians, in the land
of Goshen, which lay nearest to Canaan, and which perhaps was more
thinly peopled by the Egyptians, and well furnished with pastures for
cattle. He desired they might live separately, that they might be in the
less danger both of being infected by the vices of the Egyptians and of
being insulted by the malice of the Egyptians. Shepherds, it seems, were
an abomination to the Egyptians, that is, they looked upon them with
contempt, and scorned to converse with them; and he would not send for
his brethren to Egypt to be tramped upon. And yet, 2. He would have them
to continue shepherds, and not to be ashamed to own that as their
occupation before Pharaoh. He could have employed them under himself in
the corn-trade, or perhaps, by his interest in the king, might have
procured places for them at court or in the army, and some of them, at
least, were deserving enough; but such preferments would have exposed
them to the envy of the Egyptians, and would have tempted them to forget
Canaan and the promise made unto their fathers; therefore he contrives
to continue them in their old employment. Note, (1.) An honest calling
is no disparagement, nor ought we to account it so either in ourselves
or in our relations, but rather reckon it a shame to be idle, or to have
nothing to do. (2.) It is generally best for people to abide in the
callings that they have been bred to, and used to, [Co1
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#024.md). Whatever employment or condition
God, in his providence, has allotted for us, let us accommodate
ourselves to it, and satisfy ourselves with it, and not mind high
things. It is better to be the credit of a mean post than the shame of a
high one.
