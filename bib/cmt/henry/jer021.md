### [Jeremiah Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 21:0</span></span>

It is plain that the prophecies of this book are not placed here in the
same order in which they were preached; for there are chapters after
this which concern Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, and Jeconiah, who all reigned
before Zedekiah, in whose reign the prophecy of this chapter bears date.
Here is, I. The message which Zedekiah sent to the prophet, to desire
him to enquire of the Lord for them ([Jer
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md), [Jer
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#002).md). II. The answer which Jeremiah,
in God's name, sent to that message, in which, 1. He foretels the
certain and inevitable ruin of the city, and the fruitlessness of their
attempts for its preservation ([Jer
21:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#003).md). 2. He advises the people to
make the best of bad, by going over to the king of Babylon ([Jer
21:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#008).md). 3. He advises the king and
his family to repent and reform ([Jer
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#011.md), [Jer
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#012).md), and not to trust to the
strength of their city and grow secure ([Jer
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#013.md), [Jer
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#014).md).

[Jeremiah 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 21:1</span></span>

Here is, I. A very humble decent message which king Zedekiah, when he
was in distress, sent to Jeremiah the prophet. It is indeed charged upon
this Zedekiah that he humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet,
speaking from the mouth of the Lord ([Ch2
36:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#012).md); he did not always humble
himself as he did sometimes; he never humbled himself till necessity
forced him to it; he humbled himself so far as to desire the prophet's
assistance, but not so far as to take his advice, or to be ruled by him.
Observe,

1\. The distress which king Zedekiah was now in: Nebuchadrezzar made war
upon him, not only invaded the land, but besieged the city, and had now
actually invested it. Note, Those that put the evil day far from them
will be the more terrified when it comes upon them; and those who before
slighted God's ministers may then perhaps be glad to court an
acquaintance with them.

2\. The messengers he sent - Pashur and Zephaniah, one belonging to the
fifth course of the priests, the other to the twenty-fourth, [Ch1
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#009.md), [Ch1
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#018.md). It was well that he sent, and
that he sent persons of rank; but it would have been better if he had
desired a personal conference with the prophet, which no doubt he might
easily have had if he would so far have humbled himself. Perhaps these
priests were no better than the rest, and yet, when they were commanded
by the king, they must carry a respectful message to the prophet, which
was both a mortification to them and an honour to Jeremiah. he had
rashly said ([Jer 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#018).md), My days are
consumed with shame; and yet here we find that he lived to see better
days than those were when he made that complaint; now he appears in
reputation. Note, It is folly to say, when things are bad with us, "They
will always be so." It is possible that those who are despised may come
to be respected; and it is promised that those who honour God he will
honour, and that those who have afflicted his people shall bow to them,
[Isa 60:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#014.md).

3\. The message itself: Enquire, I pray thee, of the Lord for us, [Jer
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#002.md). Now that the Chaldean army had
got into their borders, into their bowels, they were at length convinced
that Jeremiah was a true prophet, though loth to own it and brought too
late to it. Under this conviction they desire him to stand their friend
with God, believing him to have that interest in heaven which none of
their other prophets had, who had flattered them with hopes of peace.
They now employ Jeremiah, (1.) To consult the mind of God for them:
"Enquire of the Lord for us; ask him what course we shall take in our
present strait, for the measures we have hitherto taken are all broken."
Note, Those that will not take the direction of God's grace how to get
clear of their sins would yet be glad of the directions of his
providence how to get clear of their troubles. (2.) To seek the favour
of God for them (so some read it): "Entreat the Lord for us; be an
intercessor for us with God." Note, Those that slight the prayers of
God's people and ministers when they are in prosperity may perhaps be
glad of an interest in them when they come to be in distress. Give us of
your oil. The benefit they promise themselves is, It may be the Lord
will deal with us now according to the wondrous works he wrought for our
fathers, that the enemy may raise the siege and go up from us. Observe,
\[1.\] All their care is to get rid of their trouble, not to make their
peace with God and be reconciled to him - "That our enemy may go up from
us," not, "That our God may return to us." Thus Pharaoh ([Exo
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#017).md): Entreat the Lord that he may
take away this death. \[2.\] All their hope is that God had done
wondrous works formerly in the deliverance of Jerusalem when Sennacherib
besieged it, at the prayer of Isaiah (so we are told, [Ch2
32:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#020.md), [Ch2
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#021).md), and who can tell but he may
destroy these besiegers (as he did those) at the prayer of Jeremiah? But
they did not consider how different the character of Zedekiah and his
people was from that of Hezekiah and his people: those were days of
general reformation and piety, these of general corruption and apostasy.
Jerusalem is now the reverse of what it was then. Note, It is folly to
think that God should do for us while we hold fast our iniquity as he
did for those that held fast their integrity.

II\. A very startling cutting reply which God, by the prophet, sent to
that message. If Jeremiah had been to have answered the message of
himself we have reason to think that he would have returned a
comfortable answer, in hope that their sending such a message was an
indication of some good purposes in them, which he would be glad to make
the best of, for he did not desire the woeful day. But God knows their
hearts better than Jeremiah does, and sends them an answer which has
scarcely one word of comfort in it. He sends it to them in the name of
the Lord God of Israel ([Jer 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#003).md), to
intimate to them that though God allowed himself to be called the God of
Israel, and had done great things for Israel formerly, and had still
great things in store for Israel, pursuant to his covenants with them,
yet this should stand the present generation in no stead, who were
Israelites in name only, and not in deed, any more than God's dealings
with them should cut off his relation to Israel as their God. It is here
foretold,

1\. That God will render all their endeavours for their own security
fruitless and ineffectual ([Jer 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#004).md):
"I will be so far from teaching your hands to war, and putting an edge
upon your swords, that I will turn back the weapons of war that are in
your hand, when you sally out upon the besiegers to beat them off, so
that they shall not give the stroke you design; nay, they shall recoil
into your own faces, and be turned upon yourselves." Nothing can make
for those who have God against them.

2\. That the besiegers shall in a little time make themselves masters of
Jerusalem, and of all its wealth and strength: I will assemble those in
the midst of this city who are now surrounding it. Note, If that place
which should have been a centre of devotion be made a centre of
wickedness, it is not strange if God make it a rendezvous of destroyers.

3\. That God himself will be their enemy; and then I know not who can
befriend them, no. not Jeremiah himself ([Jer
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#005).md): "I will be so far from
protecting you, as I have done formerly in a like case, that I myself
will fight against you." Note, Those who rebel against God may justly
expect that he will make war upon them, and that, (1.) With the power of
a God who is irresistibly victorious: I will fight against you with an
outstretched hand, which will reach far, and with a strong arm, which
will strike home and wound deeply. (2.) With the displeasure of a God
who is indisputably righteous. It is not a correction in love, but an
execution in anger, in fury, and in great wrath; it is upon a sentence
sworn in wrath, against which there will lie no exception, and it will
soon be found what a fearful thing it is to fall into the hands of the
living God.

4\. That those who, for their own safety, decline sallying out upon the
besiegers, and so avoid their sword, shall yet not escape the sword of
God's justice ([Jer 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#006).md): I will
smite those that abide in the city (so it may be read), both man and
beast, both the beasts that are for food and those that are for service
in war, foot and horse; they shall, die of a great pestilence, which
shall rage within the walls, while the enemies are encamped about them.
Though Jerusalem's gates and walls may for a time keep out the
Chaldeans, they cannot keep out God's judgments. His arrows of
pestilence can reach those that think themselves safe from other arrows.

5\. That the king himself, and people that escape the sword, famine, and
pestilence, shall fall into the hands of the Chaldeans, who shall cut
them off in cold blood ([Jer 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#007).md):
They shall not spare them, nor have pity on them. Let not those expect
to find mercy with men who have forfeited God's compassions, and shut
themselves out from his mercy. Thus had the decree gone forth; and then
to what purpose was it for Jeremiah to enquire of the Lord for them?

[Jeremiah 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 21:8</span></span>

By the civil message which the king sent to Jeremiah it appeared that
both he and the people began to have a respect for him, which it would
have been Jeremiah's policy to make some advantage of for himself; but
the reply which God obliges him to make is enough to crush the little
respect they begin to have for him, and to exasperate them against him
more than ever. Not only the predictions in the foregoing verses, but
the prescriptions in these, were provoking; for here,

I. He advises the people to surrender and ??desert to the Chaldeans, as
the only means left them to save their lives, [Jer
21:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#008.md). This counsel was very
displeasing to those who were flattered by their false prophets into a
desperate resolution to hold out to the last extremity, trusting to the
strength of their walls and the courage of their soldiery to keep out
the enemy, or to their foreign aids to raise the siege. The prophet
assures them, "The city shall be given into the hand of the king of
Babylon, and he shall not only plunder it, but burn it with fire, for
God himself hath set his face against this city for evil and not for
good, to lay it waste and not to protect it, for evil which shall have
no good mixed with it, no mitigation or merciful allay; and therefore,
if you would make the best of bad, you must beg quarter of the
Chaldeans, and surrender prisoners of war." In vain did Rabshakeh
persuade the Jews to do this while they had God for them ([Isa
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#016).md), but it was the best course
they could take now that God was against them. Both the law and the
prophets had often set before them life and death in another sense -
life if they obey the voice of God, death if they persist in
disobedience, [Deu 30:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#019.md). But they had
slighted that life which would have made them truly happy, to upbraid
them with which the prophet here uses the same expression ([Jer
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#008).md): Behold, I set before you the
way of life and the way of death, which denotes not, as that, a fair
proposal, but a melancholy dilemma, advising them of two evils to choose
the less; and that less evil, a shameful and wretched captivity, is all
the life now left for them to propose to themselves. He that abides in
the city, and trusts to that to secure him, shall certainly die either
by the sword without the walls or famine or pestilence within. But he
that can so far bring down his spirit, and quit his vain hopes, as to go
out, and fall to the Chaldeans, his life shall be given him for a prey;
he shall save his life, but with much difficulty and hazard, as a prey
is taken from the mighty. It is an expression like that, He shall be
saved, yet so as by fire. He shall escape but very narrowly, or he shall
have such surprising joy and satisfaction in escaping with his life from
such a universal destruction as shall equal theirs that divide the
spoil. They thought to make a prey of the camp of the Chaldeans, as
their ancestors did that of the Assyrians ([Isa
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#023).md), but they will be sadly
disappointed; if by yielding at discretion they can but save their
lives, that is all the prey they must promise themselves. Now one would
think this advice from a prophet, in God's name, should have gained some
credit with them and been universally followed; but, for aught that
appears, there were few or none that took it; so wretchedly were their
hearts hardened, to their destruction.

II\. He advises the king and princes to reform, and make conscience of
the duty of their place. Because it was the king that sent the message
to him, in the reply there shall be a particular word for the house of
the king, not to compliment or court them (that was no part of the
prophet's business, no, not when they did him the honour to send to
him), but to give them wholesome counsel ([Jer
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#011.md), [Jer
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#012).md): "Execute judgment in the
morning; do it carefully and diligently. Those magistrates that would
fill up their place with duty had need rise betimes. Do it quickly, and
do not delay to do justice upon appeals made to you, and tire out poor
petitioners as you have done. Do not lie in your beds in a morning to
sleep away the debauch of the night before, nor spend the morning in
pampering the body (as those princes, [Ecc
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#016).md), but spend it in the despatch
of business. You would be delivered out of the hand of those that
distress you, and expect that therein God should do you justice; see
then that you do justice to those that apply to you, and deliver them
out of the hand of their oppressors, lest my fury go out like fire
against you in a particular manner, and you fare worst who think to
escape best, because of the evil of your doings." Now, 1. This intimates
that it was their neglect to do their duty that brought all this
desolation upon the people. It was the evil of their doings that kindled
the fire of God's wrath. Thus plainly does he deal even with the house
of the king; for those that would have the benefit of a prophet's
prayers must thankfully take a prophet's reproofs. 2. This directs them
to take the right method for a national reformation. The princes must
begin, and set a good example, and then the people will be invited to
reform. They must use their power for the punishment of wrong, and then
the people will be obliged to reform. He reminds them that they are the
house of David, and therefore should tread in his steps, who executed
judgment and justice to his people. 3. This gives them some
encouragement to hope that there may yet be a lengthening of their
tranquillity, [Dan 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#027.md). If any thing
will recover their state from the brink of ruin, this will.

III\. He shows them the vanity of all their hopes so long as they
continued unreformed, [Jer 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#013.md), [Jer
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#014.md). Jerusalem is an inhabitant of
the valley, guarded with mountains on all sides, which were their
natural fortifications, making it difficult for an army to approach
them. It is a rock of the plain, which made it difficult for an enemy to
undermine them. These advantages of their situation they trusted to more
than to the power and promise of God; and, thinking their city by these
means to be impregnable, they set the judgments of God at defiance,
saying, "Who shall come down against us? None of our neighbours dare
make a descent upon us, or, if they do, who shall enter into our
habitations?" They had some colour for this confidence; for it appears
to have been the sense of all their neighbours that no enemy could force
his way into Jerusalem, [Lam 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#012.md). But
those are least safe that are most secure. God soon shows the vanity of
that challenge, Who shall come down against us? when he says ([Jer
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#013).md), Behold, I am against thee.
They had indeed by the wickedness driven God out of their city when he
would have tarried with them as a friend; but they could not by their
bulwarks keep them out of their city when he came against them as an
enemy. If God be for us, who can be against us? But, if he be against
us, who can be for us, to stand us in any stead? Nay, he comes against
them not as an enemy that may lawfully and with some hope of success be
resisted, but as a judge that cannot be resisted; for he says ([Jer
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#014).md), I will punish you, by due
course of law, according to the fruit of your doings, that is, according
to the merit of them and the direct tendency of them. That shall be
brought upon you which is the natural product of sin. Nay, he will not
only come with the anger of an enemy and the justice of a judge, but
with the force of a consuming fire, which has no compassion, as a judge
sometimes has, nor spares any thing combustible that comes in its way.
Jerusalem has become a forest, in which God will kindle a fire that
shall consume all before it; for our God is himself a consuming fire;
and who is able to stand in his sight when once he is angry?
