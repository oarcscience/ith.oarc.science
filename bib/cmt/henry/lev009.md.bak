### [Leviticus Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 9:0</span></span>

Aaron and his sons, having been solemnly consecrated to the priesthood,
are in this chapter entering upon the execution of their office, the
very next day after their consecration was completed. I. Moses (no doubt
by direction from God) appoints a meeting between God and his priests,
as the representatives of his people, ordering them to attend him, and
assuring them that he would appear to them ([Lev
9:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#001).md). II. The meeting is held
according to the appointment. 1. Aaron attends on God by sacrifice,
offering a sin-offering and burnt-offering for himself ([Lev
9:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#008).md), and then the offerings for
the people, whom he blessed in the name of the Lord ([Lev
9:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#015).md). 2. God signifies his
acceptance, (1.) Of their persons, by showing them his glory ([Lev
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#023)). (2..md) Of their sacrifices, by
consuming them with fire from heaven ([Lev
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024).md).

[Leviticus 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 9:1</span></span>

Orders are here given for another solemnity upon the eighth day; for the
newly-ordained priests were set to work immediately after the days of
their consecration were finished, to let them know that they were not
ordained to be idle: He that desires the office of a bishop desires a
good work, which must be looked at with desire, more than the honour and
benefit. The priests had not so much as one day's respite from service
allowed them, that they might divert themselves, and receive the
compliments of their friends upon their elevation, but were busily
employed the very next day; for their consecration was the filling of
their hands. God's spiritual priests have constant work cut out for
them, which the duty of every day requires; and those that would give up
their account with joy must redeem time; see [Eze
43:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#026.md), [Eze
43:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#027.md). Now, 1. Moses raises their
expectation of a glorious appearance of God to them this day ([Lev
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#004).md): "To day the Lord will appear to
you that are the priests." And when all the congregation are gathered
together, and stand before the Lord, he tells them ([Lev
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#006).md), The glory of the Lord shall
appear to you. Though they had reason enough to believe God's acceptance
of all that they had done according to his appointment, upon the general
assurance we have that he is the rewarder of those that diligently seek
him (even if he had not given them any sensible token of it), yet that
if possible they and theirs might be effectually obliged to the service
and worship of God, and might never turn aside to idols, the glory of
God appeared to them, and visibly owned what they had done. We are not
now to expect such appearances; we Christians walk more by faith, and
less by sight, than they did. But we may be sure that God draws nigh to
those who draw nigh to him, and that the offerings of faith are really
acceptable to him, though, the sacrifices being spiritual, the tokens of
the acceptance are, as it is fit they should be, spiritual likewise. To
those who are duly consecrated to God he will undoubtedly manifest
himself. 2. He puts both priests and people upon preparing to receive
this favour which God designed them. Aaron and his sons, and the elders
of Israel, are all summoned to attend, [Lev
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#001.md). Note, God will manifest himself
in the solemn assemblies of his people and ministers; and those that
would have the benefit and comfort of God's appearances must in them
give their attendance. (1.) Aaron is ordered to prepare his offerings: A
young calf for a sin-offering, [Lev
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#002.md). The Jewish writers suggest that a
calf was appointed for a sin-offering to remind him of his sin in making
the golden calf, by which he had rendered himself for ever unworthy of
the honour of the priesthood, and which he had reason to reflect upon
with sorrow and shame in all the atonements he made. (2.) Aaron must
direct the people to get theirs ready. Hitherto Moses had told the
people what they must do; but now Aaron, as high priest over the house
of God, must be their teacher, in things pertaining to God: Unto the
children of Israel thou shalt speak, [Lev
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#003.md). Now that he was to speak from
them to God in the sacrifices (the language of which he that appointed
them very well understood) he must speak from God to them in the laws
about the sacrifices. Thus Moses would engage the people's respect and
obedience to him, as one that was set over them in the Lord, to admonish
them. (3.) Aaron must offer his own first, and then the people's, [Lev
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#007.md). Aaron must now go to the altar,
Moses having shown him the way to it; and there, \[1.\] He must make an
atonement for himself; for the high priest, being compassed with
infirmity, ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for
sins ([Heb 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#002.md), [Heb
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#003).md), and for himself first; for how
can we expect to be accepted in our prayers for others, if we ourselves
be not reconciled to God? Nor is any service pleasing to God till the
guilt of sin be removed by our interest in the great propitiation. Those
that have the care of the souls of others are also hereby taught to look
to their own in the first place; this charity must begin at home, though
it must not end there. It is the charge to Timothy, to take care to save
himself first, and then those that heard him, [Ti1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#016.md). The high priest made atonement
for himself, as one that was joined with sinners; but we have a high
priest that was separated from sinners, and needed no atonement. When
Messiah the prince was cut off as a sacrifice, it was not for himself;
for he knew no sin. \[2.\] He must make an atonement for the people, by
offering their sacrifices. Now that he was made a high priest he must
lay to heart the concerns of the people, and this as their great
concern, their reconciliation to God, and the putting away of sin which
had separated between them and God. He must make atonement as the Lord
commanded. See here the wonderful condescension of the mercy of God,
that he not only allows an atonement to be made, but commands it; not
only admits, but requires us to be reconciled to him. No room therefore
is left to doubt but that the atonement which is commanded will be
accepted.

[Leviticus 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 9:8</span></span>

These being the first offerings that ever were offered by the levitical
priesthood, according to the newly-enacted law of sacrifices, the manner
of offering them is particularly related, that it might appear how
exactly they agreed with the institution. 1. Aaron with his own hands
slew the offering ([Lev 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#008).md), and did
the work of the inferior priests; for, great as he was, he must not
think any service below him which he could do for the honour of God:
and, as Moses had shown him how to do this work decently and
dexterously, so he showed his sons, that they might do likewise; for
this is the best way of teaching, and thus parents should instruct their
children by example. Therefore as Moses before, so Aaron now offered
some of each of the several sorts of sacrifices that were appointed,
whose rites differed, that they might be thoroughly furnished for every
good work. 2. He offered these besides the burnt-sacrifice of the
morning, which was every day offered first, [Lev
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#017.md). Note, Our accustomed devotions
morning and evening, alone and in our families, must not be omitted upon
any pretence whatsoever, no, not when extraordinary services are to be
performed; whatever is added, these must not be diminished. 3. It is not
clear whether, when it is said that he burnt such and such parts of the
sacrifices upon the altar ([Lev
9:10-20](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#010).md), the meaning is that he burnt
them immediately with ordinary fire, as formerly, or that he laid them
upon the altar ready to be burnt with the fire from heaven which they
expected ([Lev 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024).md), or whether, as
bishop Patrick thinks, he burnt the offerings for himself with ordinary
fire, but when they were burnt out he laid the people's sacrifices upon
the altar, which were kindled and consumed by the fire of the Lord. I
would rather conjecture, because it is said of all these sacrifices that
he burnt them (except the burnt-offering for the people, of which it is
said that he offered it according to the manner, [Lev
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#016), which seems to be equivalent.md),
that he did not kindle the fire to burn them, but that then the fire
from the Lord fastened upon them, put out the fire that he had kindled
(as we know a greater fire puts out a less), and suddenly consumed the
remainder, which the fire he had kindled would have consumed slowly. 4.
When Aaron had done all that on his part was to be done about the
sacrifices he lifted up his hand towards the people, and blessed them,
[Lev 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#022.md). This was one part of the
priest's work, in which he was a type of Christ, who came into the world
to bless us, and when he was parted from his disciples, at his
ascension, lifted up his hands and blessed them, and in them his whole
church, of which they were the elders and representatives, as the great
high priest of our profession. Aaron lifted up his hands in blessing
them, to intimate whence he desired and expected the blessing to come,
even from heaven, which is God's throne. Aaron could but crave a
blessing, it is God's prerogative to command it. Aaron, when he had
blessed, came down; Christ, when he blessed, went up.

[Leviticus 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 9:23</span></span>

We are not told what Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle to do,
[Lev 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#023.md). Some of the Jewish writers
say, "They went in to pray for the appearance of the divine glory;" most
probably they went in that Moses might instruct Aaron how to do the
service that was to be done there - burn incense, light the lamps, set
the show-bread, etc., that he might instruct his sons in it. But, when
they came out, they both joined in blessing the people, who stood
expecting the promised appearance of the divine glory; and it was now
(when Moses and Aaron concurred in praying) that they had what they
waited for. Note, God's manifestations of himself, of his glory and
grace, are commonly given in answer to prayer. When Christ was praying
the heavens were opened, [Luk 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#021.md).
The glory of God appeared, not while the sacrifices were in offering,
but when the priests prayed (as [Ch2
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#013).md), when they praised God, which
intimates that the prayers and praises of God's spiritual priests are
more pleasing to God than all burnt-offerings and sacrifices.

When the solemnity was finished, the blessing pronounced, and the
congregation ready to be dismissed, in the close of the day, then God
testified his acceptance, which gave them such satisfaction as was well
worth waiting for.

I. The glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people, [Lev
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#023.md). What the appearance of it was we
are not told; no doubt it was such as carried its own evidence along
with it. The glory which filled the tabernacle ([Exo
40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034).md) now showed itself at the door
of the tabernacle to those who attended there, as a prince shows himself
to the expecting crowd, to gratify them. God hereby testified of their
gifts, and showed them that he was worthy for whom they should do all
this. Note, Those that diligently attend upon God in the way he has
appointed shall have such a sight of his glory as shall be abundantly to
their satisfaction. Those that dwell in God's house with an eye of faith
may behold the beauty of the Lord.

II\. There came a fire out from before the Lord, and consumed the
sacrifice, [Lev 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024.md). Here the learned
bishop Patrick has a very probable conjecture, that Moses and Aaron
staid in the tabernacle till it was time to offer the evening sacrifice,
which Aaron did, but it is not mentioned, because it was done of course,
and it was this which the fire that came out from the Lord consumed.
Whether this fire came from heaven, or out of the most holy place, or
from that visible appearance of the glory of God which all the people
saw, it was a manifest token of God's acceptance of their service, as,
afterwards, of Solomon's sacrifice, [Ch2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001.md), and Elijah's, [Kg1
18:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#038.md).

1\. This fire did consume (or, as the word is, eat up) the present
sacrifice. And two ways this was a testimony of acceptance: - (1.) It
signified the turning away of God's wrath from them. God's wrath is a
consuming fire; this fire might justly have fastened upon the people,
and consumed them for their sins; but its fastening upon the sacrifice,
and consuming that, signified God's acceptance of that as an atonement
for the sinner. (2.) It signified God's entering into covenant and
communion with them: they ate their part of the sacrifice, and the fire
of the Lord ate up his part; and thus he did, as it were, sup with them,
and they with him, [Rev 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#020.md).

2\. This fire did, as it were, take possession of the altar. The fire
was thus kindled in God's house, which was to continue as long as the
house stood, as we read before, [Lev
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#013.md). This also was a figure of good
things to come. The Spirit descended upon the apostles in fire ([Act
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#003).md), so ratifying their commission,
as this spoken of here did the priests'. And the descent of this holy
fire into our souls to kindle in them pious and devout affections
towards God, and such a holy zeal as burns up the flesh and the lusts of
it, is a certain token of God's gracious acceptance of our persons and
performances. That redounds to God's glory which is the work of his own
grace in us. Hereby we know that we dwell in God, and God in us, because
he hath thus given us of his Spirit, [Jo1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#013). Now henceforward, (1..md) All their
sacrifices and incense must be offered with this fire. Note, Nothing
goes to God but what comes from him. We must have grace, that holy fire,
from the God of grace, else we cannot serve him acceptably, [Heb
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#028). (2..md) The priests must keep it
burning with a constant supply of fuel, and the fuel must be wood, the
cleanest of fuel. Thus those to whom God has given grace must take heed
of quenching the Spirit.

III\. We are here told how the people were affected with this discovery
of God's glory and grace; they received it, 1. With the highest joy:
They shouted; so stirring up themselves and one another to a holy
triumph, in the assurance now given them that they had God nigh unto
them, which is spoken of the grandeur of their nation, [Deu
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#007.md). 2. With the lowest reverence:
They fell on their faces, humbly adoring the majesty of that God who
vouchsafed thus to manifest himself to them. That is a sinful fear of
God which drives us from him; a gracious fear makes us bow before him.
Very good impressions were made upon their minds for the present, but
they soon wore off, as those commonly do which are made by that which is
only sensible; while the influences of faith are durable.
