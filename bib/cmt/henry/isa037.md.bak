### [Isaiah Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 37:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have a further repetition of the story which we had
before in the book of Kings concerning Sennacherib. In the foregoing
chapter we had him conquering and threatening to conquer. In this
chapter we have him falling, and at last fallen, in answer to prayer,
and in fulfillment of many of the prophecies which we have met with in
the foregoing chapters. Here we have, I. Hezekiah's pious reception of
Rabshakeh's impious discourse ([Isa
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#001).md). II. The gracious message he
sent to Isaiah to desire his prayers ([Isa
37:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#002).md). III. The encouraging answer
which Isaiah sent to him from God, assuring him that God would plead his
cause against the king of Assyria ([Isa
37:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#006.md), [Isa
37:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#007).md). IV. An abusive letter which the
king of Assyria sent to Hezekiah, to the same purport with Rabshakeh's
speech ([Isa 37:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#008).md). V. Hezekiah's
humble prayer to God upon the receipt of this letter ([Isa
37:14-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#014).md). VI. The further full answer
which God sent him by Isaiah, promising him that his affairs should
shortly take a happy turn, that the storm should blow over and every
thing should appear bright and serene (v. 21-35). VII. The immediate
accomplishment of this prophecy in the ruin of his army (v. 36) and the
murder of himself (v. 37, 38). All this was largely opened, 2 Kings 19.

[Isaiah 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 37:1</span></span>

We may observe here, 1. That the best way to baffle the malicious
designs of our enemies against us is to be driven by them to God and to
our duty and so to fetch meat out of the eater. Rabshakeh intended to
frighten Hezekiah from the Lord, but it proves that he frightens him to
the Lord. The wind, instead of forcing the traveller's coat from him,
makes him wrap it the closer about him. The more Rabshakeh reproaches
God the more Hezekiah studies to honour him, by rending his clothes for
the dishonour done to him and attending in his sanctuary to know his
mind. 2. That it well becomes great men to desire the prayers of good
men and good ministers. Hezekiah sent messengers, and honourable ones,
those of the first rank, to Isaiah, to desire his prayers, remembering
how much his prophecies of late had plainly looked towards the events of
the present day, in dependence upon which, it is probable, he doubted
not but that the issue would be comfortable, yet he would have it to be
so in answer to prayer: This is a day of trouble, therefore let it be a
day of prayer. 3. When we are most at a plunge we should be most earnest
in prayer: Now that the children are brought to the birth, but there is
not strength to bring forth, now let prayer come, and help at a dead
lift. When pains are most strong let prayers be most lively; and, when
we meet with the greatest difficulties, then is a time to stir up not
ourselves only, but others also, to take hold on God. Prayer is the
midwife of mercy, that helps to bring it forth. 4. It is an
encouragement to pray though we have but some hopes of mercy ([Isa
37:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#004).md): It may be the Lord thy God will
hear; who knows but he will return and repent? The it may be of the
prospect of the haven of blessings should quicken us with double
diligence to ply the oar of prayer. 5. When there is a remnant left, and
but a remnant, it concerns us to lift up a prayer for that remnant, [Isa
37:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#004.md). The prayer that reaches heaven
must be lifted up by a strong faith, earnest desires, and a direct
intention to the glory of God, all which should be quickened when we
come to the last stake. 6. Those that have made God their enemy we have
no reason to be afraid of, for they are marked for ruin; and, though
they may hiss, they cannot hurt. Rabshakeh has blasphemed God, and
therefore let not Hezekiah be afraid of him, [Isa
37:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#006.md). He has made God a party to the
cause by his invectives, and therefore judgment will certainly be given
against him. God will certainly plead his own cause. 7. Sinners' fears
are but prefaces to their falls. He shall hear the rumour of the
slaughter of his army, which shall oblige him to retire to his own land,
and there he shall be slain, [Isa
37:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#007.md). The terrors that pursue him
shall bring him at last to the king of terrors, [Job
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#011.md), [Job
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#014.md). The curses that come upon
sinners shall overtake them.

[Isaiah 37:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 37:8</span></span>

We may observe here, 1. That, if God give us inward satisfaction in his
promise, this may confirm us in our silently bearing reproaches. God
answered Hezekiah, but it does not appear that he, after deliberation,
sent any answer to Rabshakeh; but, God having taken the work into his
own hands, he quietly left the matter with him. So Rabshakeh returned to
the king his master for fresh instructions. 2. Those that delight in war
shall have enough of it. Sennacherib, without provocation given to him
or warning given by him, went forth to war against Judah; and now with
as little ceremony the king of Ethiopia goes forth to war against him,
[Isa 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#009.md). Those that are quarrelsome
may expect to be quarrelled with; and God sometimes checks the rage of
his enemies by giving it a powerful diversion. 3. It is bad to talk
proudly and profanely, but it is worse to write so, for this argues more
deliberation and design, and what is written spreads further, lasts
longer, and does the more mischief. Atheism and irreligion, written,
will certainly be reckoned for another day. 4. Great successes often
harden sinners' hearts in their sinful ways and make them the more
daring. Because the kings of Assyria have destroyed all lands (though,
in fact, they were but a few that fell within their reach), therefore
they doubt not but to destroy God's land; because the gods of the
nations were unable to help they conclude the God of Israel is so;
because the idolatrous kings of Hamath and Arphad became an easy prey to
them therefore they doubt not but to destroy God's land; because the
idolatrous kings of Hamath and Arphad became an easy prey to them
therefore the religious reforming king of Judah must needs be so too.
Thus is this proud man ripened for ruin by the sunshine of prosperity.
5. Liberty of access to the throne of grace, and liberty of speech
there, are the unspeakable privilege of the Lord's people at all times,
especially in times of distress and danger. Hezekiah took Sennacherib's
letter, and spread it before the Lord, not designing to make any
complaints against him but those grounded upon his own handwriting. Let
the thing speak itself; here it is in black and white: Open thy eyes, O
Lord! and see. God allows his praying people to be humbly free with him,
to utter all their words, as Jephthah did, before him, to spread the
letter, whether of a friend or an enemy, before him, and leave the
contents, the concern of it, with him. 6. The great and fundamental
principles of our religion, applied by faith and improved in prayer,
will be of sovereign use to us in our particular exigencies and
distresses, whatever they are; to them therefore we must have recourse,
and abide by them; so Hezekiah did here. He encouraged himself with
this, that the God of Israel is the Lord of hosts, of all hosts, of the
hosts of Israel, to animate him, of the hosts of their enemies, to
dispirit and restrain them, - that he is God alone, and there is none
that can stand in competition with him, - that he is the God of all the
kingdoms of the earth, and disposes of them all as he pleases; for he
made heaven and earth, and therefore both can do any thing and does
every thing. 7. When we are afraid of men that are great destroyers we
may with humble boldness appeal to God as the great Saviour. They have
indeed destroyed the nations, who had thrown themselves out of the
protection of the true God by worshipping false gods, but the Lord, the
God alone, is our God, our King, our lawgiver, and he will save us, who
is the Saviour of those that believe. 8. We have enough to take hold of,
in our wrestling with God by prayer, if we can but plead that his glory
is interested in our case, that his name will be profaned if we are run
down and glorified if we are relieved. Thence therefore will our most
prevailing pleas be drawn: "Do it for thy glory's sake."

[Isaiah 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 37:21</span></span>

We may here observe, 1. That those who receive messages of terror from
men with patience, and send messages of faith to God by prayer, may
expect messages of grace and peace from God for their comfort, even when
they are most cast down. Isaiah sent a long answer to Hezekiah's prayer
in God's name, sent it in writing (for it was too long to be sent by
word of mouth), and sent it by way of return to his prayer, relation
being thereunto had: "Whereas thou hast prayed to me, know, for thy
comfort, that thy prayer is heard." Isaiah might have referred him to
the prophecies he had delivered (particularly that ch. 10) and bid him
pick out an answer from thence; but, that he might have abundant
consolation, a message is sent him on purpose. The correspondence
between earth and heaven is never let fall on God's side. 2. Those who
magnify themselves, especially who magnify themselves against God and
his people, do really vilify themselves, and made themselves
contemptible, in the eyes of all wise men: "The virgin, the daughter of
Zion, has despised Sennacherib, and all his impotent malice and menaces;
she knows that, while she preserves her integrity, she is sure of the
divine protection, and that though the enemy may bark he cannot bite.
All his threats are a jest; it is all but brutum fulmen - a mere flash,"
3. Those who abuse the people of God affront God himself; and he takes
what is said and done against them as said and done against himself:
"Whom hast thou reproached? Even the Holy One of Israel, whom thou hast
therefore reproached because he is a Holy One." And it aggravated the
indignity Sennacherib did to God that he not only reproached him
himself, but set his servants on to do the same: By thy servants, the
abjects, thou hast reproached me. 4. Those who boast of themselves and
their own achievements reflect upon God and his providence: "Thou hast
said, I have digged, and drunk water; I have done mighty feats, and will
do more; and wilt not own that I have done it," [Isa
37:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#024.md). The most active men are no
more than God makes them, and God makes them no more than of old he
designed to make them: "What I have formed of ancient times, in an
eternal counsel, now have I brought to pass" (for God does all according
to the counsel of his will), "that thou shouldst be to lay waste
defenced cities; it is therefore intolerable arrogance to make it thy
own doing." 5. All the malice, and all the motions and projects, of the
church's enemies, are under the cognizance and check of the church's
God. Sennacherib was active and quick, here, and there, and every where,
but God knew his going out and coming in, and had always an eye upon
him, [Isa 37:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#028.md). And that was not all;
he had a hand upon him too, a strict hand, a strong hand, a hook in his
nose and a bridle in his lips, with which, though he was very headstrong
and unruly, he could and would turn him back by the way which he came,
[Isa 37:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#029.md). Hitherto he shall come and
no further. God had signed Sennacherib's commission against Judah ([Isa
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#006).md); here he supersedes it. He has
frightened them, but he must not hurt them, and therefore is discharged
from going any further; nay, his commitment is here signed, by which he
is clapped up, to answer for what he had done beyond his commission. 6.
God is his people's bountiful benefactor, as well as their powerful
protector, both a sun and a shield to those that trust in him. Jerusalem
shall be defended ([Isa 37:35](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#035).md), the
besiegers shall not come into it, no, nor come before it with any
regular attack, but they shall be routed before they begin the siege,
[Isa 37:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#033.md). But this is not all; God
will return in mercy to his people, and will do them good. Their land
shall be more than ordinarily fruitful, so that their losses shall be
abundantly repaired; they shall not feel any of the ill effects either
of the enemies' wasting the country or of their own being taken off from
husbandry. But the earth, as at first, shall bring forth of itself, and
they shall live and live plentifully upon its spontaneous productions.
The blessing of the Lord can, when he pleases, make rich without the
hand of the diligent. And let them not think that the desolations of
their country would excuse them from observing the sabbatical year,
which happened (as it should seem) the year after, and when they were
not to plough or sow; no, though they had not now their usual stock
beforehand for that year, yet they must religiously observe it, and
depend upon God to provide for them. God must be trusted in the way of
duty. 7. There is no standing before the judgments of God when they come
with commission. (1.) The greatest numbers cannot stand before them: one
angel shall, in one night, lay a vast army of men dead upon the spot,
when God commissions him so to do, [Isa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036.md). Here are 185,000 brave soldiers
in an instant turned into so many dead corpses. Many think the 76th
Psalm was penned upon occasion of this defeat, where from the spoiling
of the stout-hearted, and sending them to sleep their long sleep ([Isa
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#005).md), it is inferred that God is more
glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey ([Isa
37:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#004).md), and that he, even he, is to be
feared, [Isa 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#007.md). Angels are
employed, more than we are aware of, as ministers of God's justice, to
punish the pride and break the power of wicked men. (2.) The greatest
men cannot stand before them: The great king, the king of Assyria, looks
very little when he is forced to return, not only with shame, because he
cannot accomplish what he had projected with so much assurance, but with
terror and fear, lest the angel that had destroyed his army should
destroy him; yet he is made to look less when his own sons, who should
have guarded him, sacrificed him to his idol, whose protection he
sought, [Isa 37:37](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#037.md), [Isa
37:38](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#038.md). God can quickly stop their
breath who breathe out threatenings and slaughter against his people,
and will do it when they have filled up the measure of their iniquity;
and the Lord is known by these judgments which he executes, known to be
a God that resists the proud. Many prophecies were fulfilled in this
providence, which should encourage us, as far as they look further, and
are designed as common and general assurances of the safety of the
church and of all that trust in God, to depend upon God for the
accomplishment of them. He that has delivered does and will deliver.
Lord, forgive our enemies; but, so let all thy enemies perish, O Lord!
