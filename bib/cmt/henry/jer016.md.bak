### [Jeremiah Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 16:0</span></span>

In this chapter, I. The greatness of the calamity that was coming upon
the Jewish nation is illustrated by prohibitions given to the prophet
neither to set up a house of his own ([Jer
16:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#001).md) nor to go into the house of
mourning ([Jer 16:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#005).md) nor into the
house of feasting ([Jer 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#008.md), [Jer
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#009).md). II. God is justified in these
severe proceedings against them by an account of their great wickedness
([Jer 16:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#010).md). III. An intimation is
given of mercy in reserve ([Jer 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#014.md),
[Jer 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#015).md). IV. Some hopes are given
that the punishment of the sin should prove the reformation of the
sinners, and that they should return to God at length in a way of duty,
and so be qualified for his returns to them in a way of favour ([Jer
16:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#016).md).

[Jeremiah 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 16:1</span></span>

The prophet is here for a sign to the people. They would not regard what
he said; let it be tried whether they will regard what he does. In
general, he must conduct himself so, in every thing, as became one that
expected to see his country in ruins very shortly. This he foretold, but
few regarded the prediction; therefore he is to show that he is himself
fully satisfied in the truth of it. Others go on in their usual course,
but he, in the prospect of these sad times, is forbidden and therefore
forbears marriage, mourning for the dead, and mirth. Note, Those that
would convince others of and affect them with the word of God must make
it appear, even in the most self-denying instances, that they do believe
it themselves and are affected with it. If we would rouse others out of
their security, and persuade them to sit loose to the world, we must
ourselves be mortified to present things and show that we expect the
dissolution of them.

I. Jeremiah must not marry, nor think of having a family and being a
housekeeper ([Jer 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#002).md): Thou shalt
not take thee a wife, nor think of having sons and daughters in this
place, not in the land of Judah, not in Jerusalem, not in Anathoth. The
Jews, more than any people, valued themselves on their early marriages
and their numerous offspring. But Jeremiah must live a bachelor, not so
much in honour of virginity as in diminution of it. By this it appears
that it was advisable and seasonable only in calamitous times, and times
of present distress, [Co1 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#026.md). That
it is so is a part of the calamity. There may be a time when it will be
said, Blessed is the womb that bears not, [Luk
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#029.md). When we see such times at hand
it is wisdom for all, especially for prophets, to keep themselves as
much as may be from being entangled with the affairs of this life and
encumbered with that which, the dearer it is to them, the more it will
be the matter of their care, and fear, and grief, at such a time. The
reason here given is because the fathers and mothers, the sons and the
daughters, shall die of grievous deaths, [Jer
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#003.md), [Jer
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#004.md). As for those that have wives and
children, 1. They will have such a clog upon them that they cannot flee
from those deaths. A single man may make his escape and shift for his
own safety, when he that has a wife and children can neither find means
to convey with them nor find in his heart to go and leave them behind
him. 2. They will be in continual terror for fear of those deaths; and
the more they have to lose by them the greater will the terror and
consternation be when death appears every where in its triumphant pomp
and power. 3. The death of every child, and the aggravating
circumstances of it, will be a new death to the parent. Better have no
children than have them brought forth and bred up for the murderer ([Hos
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#013.md), [Hos
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#014).md), than see them live and die in
misery. Death is grievous, but some deaths are more grievous than
others, both to those that die and to their relations that survive them;
hence we read of so great a death, [Co2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#010.md). Two things are used a little to
palliate and alleviate the terror of death as to this world, and to
sugar the bitter pill - bewailing the dead and burying them; but, to
make those deaths grievous indeed, these are denied: They shall not be
lamented, but shall be carried off, as if all the world were weary of
them; nay, they shall not be buried, but left exposed, as if they were
designed to be monuments of justice. They shall be a dung upon the face
of the earth, not only despicable, but detestable, as if they were good
for nothing but to manure the ground; being consumed, some by the sword
and some by famine, their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven
and the beasts of the earth. Will not any one say, "Better be without
children than live to see them come to this?" What reason have we to
say,All is vanity and vexation of spirit, when those creatures that we
expect to be our greatest comforts may prove not only our heaviest
cares, but our sorest crosses!

II\. Jeremiah must not go to the house of mourning upon occasion of the
death of any of his neighbours or relations ([Jer
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#005).md): Enter thou not into the house
of mourning. It was usual to condole with those whose relations were
dead, to bemoan them, to cut themselves, and make themselves bald,
which, it seems, was commonly practised as an expression of mourning,
though forbidden by the law, [Deu
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001.md). Nay, sometimes, in a passion of
grief, they did tear themselves for them ([Jer
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#006.md), [Jer
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#007).md), partly in honour of the
deceased, thus signifying that they thought there was a great loss of
them, and partly in compassion to the surviving relations, to whom the
burden will be made the lighter by their having sharers with them in
their grief. They used to mourn with them, and so to comfort them for
the dead, as Job's friends with him and the Jews with Martha and Mary;
and it was a friendly office to give them a cup of consolation to drink,
to provide cordials for them and press them earnestly to drink of them
for the support of their spirits, give wine to those that are of heavy
heart for their father or mother, that it may be some comfort to them to
find that, though they have lost their parents, yet they have some
friends left that have a concern for them. Thus the usage stood, and it
was a laudable usage. It is a good work to others, as well as of good
use to ourselves, to go to the house of mourning. It seems, the prophet
Jeremiah had been wont to abound in good offices of this kind, and it
well became his character both as a pious man and as a prophet; and one
would think it should have made him better beloved among his people than
it should seem he was. But now God bids him not lament the death of his
friends as usual, for 1. His sorrow for the destruction of his country
in general must swallow up his sorrow for particular deaths. His tears
must now be turned into another channel; and there is occasion enough
for them all. 2. He had little reason to lament those who died now just
before the judgments entered which he saw at the door, but rather to
think those happy who were seasonable taken away from the evil to come.
3. This was to be a type of what was coming, when there should be such
universal confusion that all neighbourly friendly offices should be
neglected. Men shall be in deaths so often, and even dying daily, that
they shall have no time, no room, no heart, for the ceremonies that used
to attend death. The sorrows shall be so ponderous as not to admit
relief, and every one so full of grief for his own troubles that he
shall have no thought of his neighbours. All shall be mourners then, and
no comforters; every one will find it enough to bear his own burden; for
([Jer 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#005).md), "I have taken away my
peace from this people, put a full period to their prosperity, deprived
them of health, wealth, and quiet, and friends, and every thing
wherewith they might comfort themselves and one another." Whatever peace
we enjoy, it is God's peace; it is his gift, and, if he give quietness,
who then can make trouble? But, if we make not a good use of his peace,
he can and will take it away; and where are we then? [Job
34:29](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#029.md). "I will take away my peace,
even my loving-kindness and mercies;" these shall be shut up and
restrained, which are the fresh springs from which all their fresh
streams flow, and then farewell all good. Note, Those have cut
themselves off from all true peace that have thrown themselves out of
the favour of God. All is gone when God takes away from us his
lovingkindness and his mercies. Then it follows ([Jer
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#006).md), Both the great and the small
shall die, even in this land, the land of Canaan, that used to be called
the land of the living. God's favour is our life; take away that, and we
die, we perish, we all perish.

III\. Jeremiah must not go to the house of mirth, any more than to the
house of mourning, [Jer 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#008.md). It had
been his custom, and it was innocent enough, when any of his friends
made entertainments at their houses and invited him to them, to go and
sit with them, not merely to drink, but to eat and to drink, soberly and
cheerfully. But now he must not take that liberty, 1. Because it was
unseasonable, and inconsistent with the providences of God in reference
to that land and nation. God called aloud to weeping, and mourning, and
fasting; he was coming forth against them in his judgments; and it was
time for them to humble themselves; and it well became the prophet who
gave them the warning to give them an example of taking the warning, and
complying with it, and so to make it appear that he did himself believe
it. Ministers ought to be examples of self-denial and mortification, and
to show themselves affected with those terrors of the Lord with which
they desire to affect others. And it becomes all the sons of Zion to
sympathize with her in her afflictions, and not to be merry when she is
perplexed, [Amo 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#006.md). 2. Because he
must thus show the people what sad times were coming upon them. His
friends wondered that he would not meet them, as he used to do, in the
house of feasting. But he lets them know it was to intimate to them that
all their feasting would be at an end shortly ([Jer
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#009).md): "I will cause to cease the
voice of mirth. You shall have nothing to feast on, nothing to rejoice
in, but be surrounded with calamities that shall mar your mirth and cast
a damp upon it." God can find ways to tame the most jovial. "This shall
be done in this place, in Jerusalem, that used to be the joyous city and
thought her joys were all secure to her. It shall be done in your eyes,
in your sight, to be a vexation to you, who now look so haughty and so
merry. It shall be done in your days; you yourselves shall live to see
it." The voice of praise they had made to cease by their iniquities and
idolatries, and therefore justly God made to cease among them the voice
of mirth and gladness. The voice of God's prophets was not heard, was
not heeded, among them, and therefore no longer shall the voice of the
bridegroom and of the bride, of the songs that used to grace the
nuptials, be heard among them. See [Jer
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#034.md).

[Jeremiah 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 16:10</span></span>

Here is, 1. An enquiry made into the reasons why God would bring those
judgments upon them ([Jer 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#010).md): When
thou shalt show this people all these words, the words of this curse,
they will say unto thee, Wherefore has the Lord pronounced all this
great evil against us? One would hope that there were some among them
that asked this question with a humble penitent heart, desiring to know
what was the sin for which God contended with them, that they might cast
it away and prevent the judgment: "Show us the Jonah that raises the
storm and we will throw it overboard." But it seems here to be the
language of those who quarrelled at the word of God, and challenged him
to show what they had done which might deserve so severe a punishment:
"What is our iniquity? Or what is our sin? What crime have we even been
guilty of, proportionable to such a sentence?" Instead of humbling and
condemning themselves, they stand upon their own justification and
insinuate that God did them wrong in pronouncing this evil against them,
that he laid upon them more than was right, and that they had reason to
enter into judgment with God, [Job
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#023.md). Note, It is amazing to see how
hardly sinners are brought to justify God and judge themselves when they
are in trouble, and to own the iniquity and the sin that have procured
them the trouble. 2. A plain and full answer given to this enquiry. Do
they ask the prophet why, and for what reason, God is thus angry with
them? He shall not stop their mouths by telling them that they may be
sure there is a sufficient reason, the righteous God is never angry
without cause, without good cause; but he must tell them particularly
what is the cause, that they may be convinced and humbled, or at least
that God may be justified. Let them know then, (1.) That God visited
upon them the iniquities of their fathers ([Jer
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#011).md): Your fathers have forsaken me,
and have not kept my law. They shook off divine institutions and grew
weary of them (they thought them too plain, too mean), and then they
walked after other gods, whose worship was more gay and pompous; and,
being fond of variety and novelty, they served them and worshipped them;
and this was the sin which God had said, in the second commandment, he
would visit upon their children, who kept up these idolatrous usages,
because they received them by tradition from their fathers, [Pe1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018). (2..md) That God reckoned with them
for their own iniquities ([Jer 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#012).md):
"You have made your fathers' sin your own, and have become obnoxious to
the punishment which in their days was deferred, for you have done worse
than your fathers." If they had made a good use of their fathers'
reprieve, and had been led by the patience of God to repentance, they
would have fared the better for it and the judgment would have been
prevented, the reprieve turned into a national pardon; but, making an
ill use of it, and being hardened by it in their sins, they fared the
worse for it, and, the reprieve having expired, an addition was made to
the sentence and it was executed with the more severity. They were more
impudent and obstinate in sin than their fathers, walked every one after
the imagination of his own heart, made that their guide and rule and
were resolved to follow that, on purpose that they might not hearken to
God and his prophets. They designedly suffered their own lusts and
passions to be noisy, that they might drown the voice of their
consciences. No wonder then that God has taken up this resolution
concerning them ([Jer 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#013).md): "I will
cast you out of this land, this land of light, this valley of vision.
Since you will not hearken to me, you shall not hear me; you shall be
hurried away, not into a neighbouring country which you have formerly
had some acquaintance and correspondence with, but into a far country, a
land that you know not, neither you nor your fathers, in which you have
no interest, nor can expect to meet with any comfortable society, to be
an allay to your misery." Justly were those banished into a strange land
who doted upon strange gods, which neither they nor their fathers knew,
[Deu 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#017.md). Two things would make
their case there very miserable, and both of them relate to the soul,
the better part; the greatest calamities of their captivity were those
which affected that and debarred that from its bliss. \[1.\] "It is the
happiness of the soul to be employed in the service of God; but there
shall you serve other gods day and night; that is, you shall be in
continual temptation to serve them and perhaps compelled to do it by
your cruel task-masters; and, when you are forced to worship idols, you
will be as sick of such worship as ever you were fond of it when it was
forbidden you by your godly kings." See how God often makes men's sin
their punishment, and fills the backslider in heart with his own ways.
"You shall have no public worship at all but the worship of idols, and
then you will think with regret how you slighted the worship of the true
God." \[2.\] "It is the happiness of the soul to have some tokens of the
lovingkindness of God, but you shall go to a strange land, where I will
not show you favour." If they had had God's favour, that would have made
even the land of their captivity a pleasant land; but, if they lie under
his wrath, the yoke of their oppression will be intolerable to them.

[Jeremiah 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 16:14</span></span>

There is a mixture of mercy and judgment in these verses, and it is hard
to know to which to apply some of the passages here - they are so
interwoven, and some seem to look as far forward as the times of the
gospel.

I. God will certainly execute judgment upon them for their idolatries.
Let them expect it, for the decree has gone forth. 1. God sees all their
sins, though they commit them ever so secretly and palliate them ever so
artfully ([Jer 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#017).md): My eyes are
upon all their ways. They have not their eye upon God, have no regard to
him, stand in no awe of him; but he has his eye upon them; neither they
nor their sins are hidden from his face, from his eyes. Note, None of
the sins of sinners either can be concealed from God or shall be
overlooked by him, [Pro 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#021.md); [Job
34:21](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#021.md); [Psa
90:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#008.md). 2. God is highly displeased,
particularly at their idolatries, [Jer
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#018.md). As his omniscience convicts
them, so his justice condemns them: I will recompense their iniquity and
their sin double, not double to what it deserves, but double to what
they expect and to what I have done formerly. Or I will recompense it
abundantly; they shall now pay for their long reprieve and the divine
patience they have abused. The sin for which God has a controversy with
them is their having defiled God's land with their idolatries, and not
only alienated that which he was entitled to as his inheritance, but
polluted that which he dwelt in with delight as his inheritance, and
made it offensive to him with the carcases of their detestable things,
the gods themselves which they worshipped, the images of which, though
they were of gold and silver, were as loathsome to God as the putrid
carcases of men or beasts are to us. Idols are carcases of detestable
things. God hates them, and so should we. Or he might refer to the
sacrifices which they offered to these idols, with which the land was
filled; for they had high places in all the coasts and corners of it.
This was the sin which, above any other, incensed God against them. 3.
He will find out and raise up instruments of his wrath, that shall cast
them out of their land, according to the sentence passed upon them ([Jer
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#016).md): I will send for many fishers
and many hunters - the Chaldean army, that shall have many ways of
ensnaring and destroying them, by fraud as fishers, by force as hunters.
They shall find them out wherever they are, and shall chase and closely
pursue them, to their ruin. They shall discover them wherever they are
hid, in hills or mountains, or holes of the rocks, and shall drive them
out. God has various ways of prosecuting a people with his judgments
that avoid the convictions of his word. He has men at command fit for
his purpose; he has them within call, and can send for them when he
pleases. 4. Their bondage in Babylon shall be sorer and much more
grievous than that in Egypt, their task-masters more cruel, and their
lives made more bitter. This is implied in the promise ([Jer
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#014.md), [Jer
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#015).md), that their deliverance out of
Babylon shall be more illustrious in itself, and more welcome to them,
than that out of Egypt. Their slavery in Egypt came upon them gradually
and almost insensibly; that in Babylon came upon them at once and with
all the aggravating circumstances of terror. In Egypt they had a Goshen
of their own, but none such in Babylon. In Egypt they were used as
servants that were useful, in Babylon as captives that had been hateful.
5. They shall be warned, and God shall be glorified, by these judgments
brought upon them. These judgments have a voice, and speak aloud, (1.)
Instruction to them. When God chastens them he teaches them. By this rod
God expostulates with them ([Jer
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#020).md): "Shall a man make gods to
himself? Will any man be so perfectly void of all reason and
consideration as to think that a god of his own making can stand him in
any stead? Will you ever again be such fools as you have been, to make
to yourselves gods which are no gods, when you have a God whom you may
call your own, who made you, and is himself the true and living God?"
(2.) Honour to God; for he will be known by the judgments which he
executes. He will first recompense their iniquity ([Jer
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#018).md), and then he will this once
([Jer 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#021).md) - this once for all, not
by many interruptions of their peace, but this one desolation and
destruction of it. "For this once, and no more, I will cause them to
know my hand, the length and weight of my punishing hand, how far it can
reach and how deeply it can wound. And they shall know that my name is
Jehovah, a God with whom there is no contending, who gives being to
threatenings and puts life into them as well as promises."

II\. Yet he has mercy in store for them, intimations of which come in
here for the encouragement of the prophet himself and of those few among
them that tremble at God's word. It was said, with an air of severity
([Jer 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#013).md), that God would banish
them into a strange land; but, that thereby they might not be driven to
despair, there follow immediately words of comfort.

1\. The days will come, the joyful days, when the same hand that
dispersed them shall gather them again, [Jer
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#014.md), [Jer
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#015.md). They are cast out, but they are
not cast off, they are not cast away. They shall be brought up from the
land of the north, the land of their captivity, where they are held with
a strong hand, and from all the lands whither they are driven, and where
they seemed to be lost and buried in the crowd; nay, I will bring them
again into their own land, and settle them there. As he foregoing
threatenings agreed with what was written in this law, so does this
promise. Yet will I not cast them away, [Lev
26:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#044.md). Thence will the Lord thy God
gather thee, [Deu 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#004.md). And the
following words ([Jer 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#016).md) may be
understood as a promise; God will send for fishers and hunters, the
Medes and Persians, that shall find them out in the countries where they
are scattered, and send them back to their own land; or Zerubbabel, and
others of their own nation, who should fish them out and hunt after
them, to persuade them to return; or whatever instruments the Spirit of
God made use of to stir up their spirits to go up, which at first they
were backward to do. They began to nestle in Babylon; but, as an eagle
stirs up her nest and flutters over her young, so God did by them, [Zac
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#007.md).

2\. Their deliverance out of Babylon should, upon some accounts, be more
illustrious and memorable than their deliverance out of Egypt was. Both
were the Lord's doing and marvellous in their eyes; both were proofs
that the Lord liveth and were to be kept in everlasting remembrance, to
his honour, as the living God; but the fresh mercy shall be so
surprising, so welcome, that it shall even abolish the memory of the
former. Not but that new mercies should put us in mind of old ones, and
give us occasion to renew our thanksgivings for them; yet because we are
tempted to think that the former days were better than these, and to
ask, Where are all the wonders that our fathers told us of? as if God's
arm had waxed short, and to cry up the age of miracles above the later
ages, when mercies are wrought in a way of common providence, therefore
we are allowed here comparatively to forget the bringing of Israel out
of Egypt as a deliverance outdone by that out of Babylon. That was done
by might and power, this by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts, [Zac
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006.md). In this there was more of
pardoning mercy (the most glorious branch of divine mercy) than in that;
for their captivity in Babylon had more in it of the punishment of sin
than their bondage in Egypt; and therefore that which comforts Zion in
her deliverance out of Babylon is this, that her iniquity is pardoned,
[Isa 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002.md). Note, God glorifies
himself, and we must glorify him, in those mercies that have no miracles
in them, as well as in those that have. And, though the favours of God
to our fathers must not be forgotten, yet those to ourselves in our own
day we must especially give thanks for.

3\. Their deliverance out of captivity shall be accompanied with a
blessed reformation, and they shall return effectually cured of their
inclination to idolatry, which will complete their deliverance and make
it a mercy indeed. They had defiled their own land with their detestable
things, [Jer 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#018.md). But, when they
have smarted for so doing, they shall come and humble themselves before
God, [Jer 16:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#019). (1..md) They shall be
brought to acknowledge that their God only is God indeed, for he is a
God in need - "My strength to support and comfort me, my fortress to
protect and shelter me, and my refuge to whom I may flee in the day of
affliction." Note, Need drives many to God who had set themselves at a
distance from him. Those that slighted him in the day of their
prosperity will be glad to flee to him in the day of their affliction.
(2.) They shall be quickened to return to him by the conversion of the
Gentiles: The Gentiles shall come to thee from the ends of the earth;
and therefore shall not we come? Or, "The Jews, who had by their
idolatries made themselves as Gentiles (so I rather understand it),
shall come to thee by repentance and reformation, shall return to their
duty and allegiance, even from the ends of the earth, from all the
countries whither they were driven." The prophet comforts himself with
the hope of this, and in a transport of joy returns to God the notice he
had given him of it: "O Lord! my strength and my fortress, I am now
easy, since thou hast given me a prospect of multitudes that shall come
to thee from the ends of the earth, both of Jewish converts and of
Gentile proselytes." Note, Those that are brought to God themselves
cannot but rejoice greatly to see others coming to him, coming back to
him. (3.) They shall acknowledge the folly of their ancestors, which it
becomes them to do, when they were smarting for the sins of their
ancestors: "Surely our fathers have inherited, not the satisfaction they
promised themselves and their children, but lies, vanity, and things
wherein there is no profit. We are now sensible that our fathers were
cheated in their idolatrous worship; it did not prove what it promised,
and therefore what have we to do any more with it?" Note, It were well
if the disappointment which some have met with in the service of sin,
and the pernicious consequences of it to them, might prevail to deter
others from treading in their steps. (4.) They shall reason themselves
out of their idolatry; and that reformation is likely to be sincere and
durable which results from a rational conviction of the gross absurdity
there is in sin. They shall argue thus with themselves (and it is well
argued), Should a man be such a fool, so perfectly void of the reason of
a man, as to make gods to himself, the creatures of his own fancy, the
work of his own hands, when they are really no gods? [Jer
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#020.md). Can a man be so besotted, so
perfectly lost to human understanding, as to expect any divine blessing
or favour from that which pretends to no divinity but what it first
received from him? (5.) They shall herein give honour to God, and make
it to appear that they know both his hand in his providence and his name
in his word, and that they are brought to know his name by what they are
made to know of his hand, [Jer 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#021.md).
This once, now at length, they shall be made to know that which they
would not be brought to know by all the pains the prophets took with
them. Note, So stupid are we that nothing less than the mighty hand of
divine grace, known experimentally, can make us know rightly the name of
God as it is revealed to us.

4\. Their deliverance out of captivity shall be a type and figure of
this great salvation to be wrought out by the Messiah, who shall gather
together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad. And this
is that which so far outshines the deliverance out of Egypt as even to
eclipse the lustre of it, and make it even to be forgotten. To this some
apply that of the many fishers and hunters, the preachers of the gospel,
who were fishers of men, to enclose souls with the gospel net, to find
them out in every mountain and hill, and secure them for Christ. Then
the Gentiles came to God, some from the ends of the earth, and turned to
the worship of him from the service of dumb idols.
