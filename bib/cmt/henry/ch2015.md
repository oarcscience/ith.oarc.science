### [2 Chronicles Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 15:0</span></span>

Asa and his army were now returning in triumph from the battle, laden
with spoils and adorned with the trophies of victory, the pious prince,
we may now suppose, studying what he should render to God for this great
favour. He knew that the work of reformation, which he had begun in his
kingdom, was not perfected; his enemies abroad were subdued, but there
were more dangerous enemies at home that were yet unconquered - idols in
Judah and Benjamin: his victory over the former emboldened him
vigorously to renew his attack upon the latter. Now here we have, I. The
message which God sent to him, by a prophet, to engage him to, and
encourage him in, the prosecution of his reformation ([Ch2
15:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001).md). II. The life which this
message put into that good cause, and their proceedings in pursuance of
it. Idols removed ([Ch2 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#008).md). The
spoil dedicated to God ([Ch2 15:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#009).md).
A covenant made with God, and a law for the punishing of idolaters ([Ch2
15:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#012).md). A reformation at court
([Ch2 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#016).md). Dedicated things brought
into the house of God ([Ch2 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#018).md).
All well, but that the high places were permitted ([Ch2
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#017).md). And the effect of this was
great peace ([Ch2 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#019).md).

[2 Chronicles 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 15:1</span></span>

It was a great happiness to Israel that they had prophets among them;
yet, while they were thus blessed, they were strangely addicted to
idolatry, whereas, when the spirit of prophecy had ceased under the
second temple, and the canon of the Old Temple was completed (which was
constantly read in their synagogues), they were pure from idolatry; for
the scriptures are of all other the most sure word of prophecy, and most
effectual, and the church could not be so easily imposed upon by a
counterfeit Bible as by a counterfeit prophet. Here was a prophet sent
to Asa and his army, when they returned victorious from the war with the
Ethiopians, not to compliment them and congratulate them on their
success, but to quicken them to their duty; this is the proper business
of God's ministers, even with princes and the greatest men. The Spirit
of God came upon the prophet ([Ch2
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001).md), both to instruct him what he
should say and to enable him to say it with clearness and boldness.

I. He told them plainly upon what terms they stood with God. Let them
not think that, having obtained this victory, all was their own for
ever; no, he must let them know they were upon their good behaviour. Let
them do well, and it will be well with them, otherwise not. 1. The Lord
is with you while you are with him. This is both a word of comfort, that
those who keep close to God shall always have his presence with them,
and also a word of caution: "He is with you, while you are with him, but
no longer; you have now a signal token of his favourable presence with
you, but the continuance of it depends upon your perseverance in the way
of your duty." 2. "If you seek him, he will be found of you. Sincerely
desire his favour, and aim at it, and you shall obtain it. Pray, and you
shall prevail. He never said, nor ever will, Seek you me in vain." See
[Heb 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006.md). But, 3. "If you forsake him
and his ordinances, he is not tied to you, but will certainly forsake
you, and then you are undone, your present triumphs will be no security
to you; woe to you when God departs."

II\. He set before them the dangerous consequence of forsaking God and
his ordinances, and that there was no way of having grievances
redressed, but by repenting, and returning unto God. When Israel forsook
their duty they were over-run with a deluge of atheism, impiety,
irreligion, and all irregularity ([Ch2
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#003).md), and were continually
embarrassed with vexatious and destroying wars, foreign and domestic,
[Ch2 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#005.md), [Ch2
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#006.md). But when their troubles drove
them to God they found it not in vain to seek him, [Ch2
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#004.md). But the question is, What time
does this refer to? 1. Some think it looks as far back as the days of
the Judges. A long season ago Israel was without the true God, for they
worshipped false gods; it was a time of ignorance, for, though they had
priests, they had no teaching priests, though they had elders, yet no
law to any purpose, v. 3. These were sad times, when they were
frequently oppressed by one enemy or other and grievously harassed by
Moabites, Midianites, Ammonites, and other nations. They were vexed with
all adversity (v. 6), yet when, in their perplexity, they turned to God
by repentance, prayer, and reformation, he raised up deliverers for
them. Then was that maxim often verified, that God is with us while we
are with him. Whatsoever things of this kind were written aforetime were
written for our admonition. 2. Others think it describes the state of
the ten tribes (who were now properly called Israel) in the days of Asa.
"Now, since Jeroboam set up the calves, though he pretended to honour
the God that brought them out of Egypt, yet his idolatry has brought
them to downright infidelity; they are without the true God," and no
marvel when they were without teaching priests. Jeroboam's priests were
not teachers, and thus they came to be without law. It is next to
impossible that any thing of religion should be kept up without a
preaching ministry. In those times there was no peace, [Ch2
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#005.md). Their war with Judah gave them
frequent alarms; so did the late insurrection of Baasha and other
occasions not mentioned. They provoked God with all iniquity, and then
he vexed them with all adversity; yet, when they turned to God, he was
entreated for them. Let Judah take notice of this; let their neighbours'
harms be their warnings. Give no countenance to graven images for you
see what mischiefs they produce. 3. Others think the whole passage may
be read in the future tense, and that it looks forward: Hereafter Israel
will be without the true God and a teaching priest, and they will be
destroyed by one judgment after another till they return to God and seek
him. See [Hos 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004.md).

III\. Upon this he grounded his exhortation to prosecute the work of
reformation with vigour ([Ch2 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#007).md):
Be strong, for your work shall be rewarded. Note, 1. God's work should
be done with diligence and cheerfulness, but will not be done without
resolution. 2. This should quicken us to the work of religion, that we
shall be sure not to lose by it ultimately. It will not go unrewarded.
How should it, when the work is its own reward?

[2 Chronicles 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 15:8</span></span>

We are here told what good effect the foregoing sermon had upon Asa.

I. He grew more bold for God than he had been. His victory would inspire
him with some new degrees of resolution, but this message from God with
much more. Now he took courage. he saw how necessary a further
reformation was, and what assurance he had of God's presence with him in
it; and this made him daring, and helped him over the difficulties which
had before deterred him and driven him off from the undertaking. Now he
ventured to destroy all the abominable idols (and all idolatries are
abominable, [Pe1 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#003).md) as far as ever
his power went. Away with them all. He also renewed the altar of the
Lord, which, it seems, had gone out of repair, though it was not above
thirty-five years since Solomon's head was laid, who erected it. So soon
did these ceremonial institutions begin to wax old, as things which, in
the fulness of time, must vanish away, [Heb
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#013.md).

II\. He extended his influence further than before, [Ch2
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#009.md). He summoned a solemn assembly,
and particularly brought the strangers to it, who had come over to him
from the ten tribes. 1. Their coming was a great encouragement to him;
for the reason of their coming was because they saw that the Lord his
God was with him. It is good to be with those that have God with them,
to come into relation to, and contract acquaintance and friendship with,
those that live in the fear and favour of God. We will go with you, for
we have heard that God is with you, [Zac
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#023.md). 2. The cognizance he took of
them, and the invitation he gave them to the general assembly, were a
great encouragement to them. All strangers are to be helped, but those
that cast themselves upon God's good providence, purely to keep a good
conscience, are worthy of double honour. Asa gave orders for the
gathering of them together ([Ch2
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#009).md), yet it is said ([Ch2
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#010).md) that they gathered themselves
together, made it their own act, so forward were they to obey the king's
orders. This meeting was held in the third month, probably at the feast
of Pentecost, which was in that month.

III\. He and his people offered sacrifices to God, as his share of the
spoil they had got, [Ch2 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#011.md). Their
offering here was nothing to Solomon's ([Ch2
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#005).md), which was owing to the
diminution either of their zeal or of their wealth, or of both. These
sacrifices were intended by way of thanksgiving for the favours they had
received, and supplication for further favours. Prayers and praises are
now our spiritual sacrifices. And, as he took care that the altar should
have its gift, so he took care that the temple should have its gold: He
brought into the house of God all the dedicated things, [Ch2
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#018.md). It is honesty to render to God
the things that are his. What has been long designed for him, and long
laid by for him, as it should seem these dedicated things had been,
should at length be laid out for him. Will a man rob God, or make slow
payment to him, who is always ready to do us good?

IV\. They entered into covenant with God, repenting that they had
violated their engagements to him and resolving to do better for the
future. It is proper for penitents, for converts, to renew their
covenants. It should seem, the motion came not from Asa, but from the
people themselves. Let every man be a volunteer that covenants with God.
Thy people shall be willing, [Psa
110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md). Observe,

1\. What was the matter of this covenant. Nothing but what they were
before obliged to; and, though no vow or promise of theirs could lay any
higher obligation upon them than they were already under from the divine
precept, yet it would help to increase their sense of the obligation, to
arm them against temptations, and would be a testimony to the equity and
goodness of the precept. And, by joining all together in this covenant,
they strengthened the hands one of another. Two things they engaged
themselves to: - (1.) That they would diligently seek God themselves,
seek his precepts, seek his favour. What is religion but seeking God,
enquiring after him, applying to him, upon all occasions? We shall not
enjoy him till we come to heaven; while we are here we must continue
seeking. They would seek God as the God of their fathers, in the way
that their fathers sought him and in dependence upon the promise made to
their fathers; and they would do it with all their heart and with all
their soul, for those only seek God acceptably and successfully that are
inward with him, intent upon him, and entire for him, in their seeking
him. We make nothing of our religion if we do not make heart-work of it.
God will have all the heart or none; and, when a jewel of such
inestimable value as the divine favour is to be found, it is worth while
to seek it with all our soul. (2.) That they would, to the utmost of
their power, oblige others to seek him, [Ch2
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#013.md). They agreed that whosoever
would not seek the Lord God of Israel (that is, would either worship
other gods or refuse to join with them in the worship of the true God,
that was either an obstinate idolater or an obstinate atheist) he should
be put to death. This was no new law of their own making, but an order
to put in execution that law of God to this purport, [Deu
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#002.md), etc. If this law had been duly
executed, there would not have been so many abominable idols found in
Judah and Benjamin, [Ch2 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#008.md). Whether
men may now, under the gospel, be compelled by such methods as these to
seek the Lord is justly questioned; for the weapons of our warfare are
not carnal, and yet mighty.

2\. In what manner they made this covenant. (1.) With great
cheerfulness, and all possible expressions of joy: The swore unto the
Lord; not secretly, as if they were either ashamed of what they did or
afraid of binding themselves too fast to him, but with a loud voice, to
express their own zeal and to animate one another; and they all rejoiced
at the oath, [Ch2 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#014.md), [Ch2
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#015.md). They did not swear to God with
reluctancy (as the poor debtor confesses a judgment to his creditor),
but with all the pleasure and satisfaction imaginable, as the bridegroom
plights his troth to the bride in the marriage covenant. Every honest
Israelite was pleased with his own engagements to God, and they were all
pleased with one another's. They rejoiced in it as a hopeful expedient
to prevent their apostasy from God and a happy indication of God's
presence with them. Note, The times of renewing our covenant with God
should be times of rejoicing, and national reformation cannot but give
general satisfaction to all that are good. It is an honour and happiness
to be in bonds to God. (2.) They did it with great sincerity, zeal and
resolution: They swore to God with all their hearts, and sought him with
their whole desire. The Israelites were now in an extraordinarily good
frame. O that there had always been such a heart in them! This comes in
as the reason why they rejoiced so much in what they did: it was because
they were hearty in it. Note, Those only experience the pleasure and
comfort of religion that are sincere and upright in it. What is done in
hypocrisy is a mere drudgery. But, if God has the heart, we have the
joy.

V. We are told what was the effect of this their solemn covenanting with
God. 1. God did well for them: He was found of them, and gave them rest
round about ([Ch2 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#015).md), so that
there was no war for a long time after ([Ch2
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#019).md), no open general war, though
there were constant bickerings between Judah and Israel upon the
frontiers, [Kg1 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#016.md). National piety
procures national blessings. 2. They did, on the whole, well for him.
They carried on the reformation so far that Maachah the queen-mother was
deposed for idolatry and her idol destroyed, [Ch2
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#016.md). This was bravely done of Asa,
that he would not connive at idolatry in those that were nearest to him,
like Levi, that said to his father and mother, I have not seen him, [Deu
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#009.md). Asa knows he must honour God
more than his grandmother, and dares not leave an idol in an apartment
of his palace while he is destroying idols in the cities of his kingdom.
We may suppose this Maachah was so far convinced of her sin that she was
willing to subscribe the association mentioned ([Ch2
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#012.md), [Ch2
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#013).md), binding herself to seek the
Lord, and therefore was not put to death as those were that refused to
sign it, great as well as small, women as well as men: probably it was
with an eye to her that women were specified. But because she had been
an idolater Asa thought fit to divest her of the dignity and authority
she had, and probably he banished her the court and confined her to
privacy, lest she should influence and infect others. But the
reformation was not complete; the high places were not all taken away,
though many of them were, [Ch2 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#003.md),
[Ch2 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#005.md). Those in the cities were
removed, but not those in the cities of Judah, but not those in the
cities of Israel which were reduced to the house of David; or those that
were used in the service of false gods, but not those that were used in
the service of the God of Israel. These he connived at, and yet his
heart was perfect. There may be defects in some particular duties where
yet the heart, in the man, is upright with God. Sincerity is something
less than sinless perfection.
