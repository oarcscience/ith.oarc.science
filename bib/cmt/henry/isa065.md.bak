### [Isaiah Chapter 65](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 65:0</span></span>

We are now drawing towards the conclusion of this evangelical prophecy,
the last two chapters of which direct us to look as far forward as the
new heavens and the new earth, the new world which the gospel
dispensation should bring in, and the separation that should by it be
made between the precious and the vile. "For judgment" (says Christ)
"have I come into this world." And why should it seem absurd that the
prophet here should speak of that to which all the prophets bore
witness? [Pe1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010.md), [Pe1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011.md). The rejection of the Jews, and
the calling in of the Gentiles, are often mentioned in the New Testament
as that which was foreseen and foretold by the prophets, [Act
10:43](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#043.md); [Act
13:40](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#040.md); [Rom
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#026.md). In this chapter we have, I. The
anticipating of the Gentiles with the gospel call ([Isa
65:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#010).md). II. The rejection of the Jews
for their obstinacy and unbelief ([Isa
65:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#002).md). III. The saving of a remnant
of them by bringing them into the gospel church ([Isa
65:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#008).md). IV. The judgments of God
that should pursue the rejected Jews ([Isa
65:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#011).md). V. The blessings reserved
for the Christian church, which should be its joy and glory ([Isa
65:17-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017).md). But these things are here
prophesied of under the type and figure of the difference God would make
between some and others of the Jews after their return out of captivity,
between those that feared God and those that did not, with reproofs of
the sins then found among them and promises of the blessings then in
reserve for them.

[Isaiah 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 65:1</span></span>

The apostle Paul (an expositor we may depend upon) has given us the true
sense of these verses, and told us what was the event they pointed at
and were fulfilled in, namely, the calling in of the Gentiles and the
rejection of the Jews, by the preaching of the gospel, [Rom
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#020.md), [Rom
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#021.md). And he observes that herein
Esaias is very bold, not only in foretelling a thing so improbable ever
to be brought about, but in foretelling it to the Jews, who would take
it as a gross affront to their nation, and therein Moses's words would
be made good ([Deu 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021).md), I will
provoke you to jealousy by those that are no people.

I. It is here foretold that the Gentiles, who had been afar off, should
be made nigh, [Isa 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001.md). Paul reads it
thus: I was found of those that sought me not; I was made manifest to
those that asked not for me. Observe what a wonderful and blessed change
was made with them and how they were surprised into it. 1. Those who had
long been without God in the world shall now be set a seeking him; those
who had not said, Where is God my maker? shall now begin to enquire
after him. Neither they nor their fathers had called upon his name, but
either lived without prayer or prayed to stocks and stones, the work of
men's hands. But now they shall be baptized and call on the name of the
Lord, [Act 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#021.md). With what pleasure
does the great God here speak of his being sought unto, and how does he
glory in it, especially by those who in time past had not asked for him!
For there is joy in heaven over great sinners who repent. 2. God shall
anticipate their prayers with his blessings: I am found of those that
sought me not. This happy acquaintance and correspondence between God
and the Gentile world began on his side; they came to know God because
they were known of him ([Gal 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009).md), to
seek God and find him because they were first sought and found of him.
Though in after-communion God is found of those that seek him ([Pro
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#017).md), yet in the first conversion he
is found of those that seek him not; for therefore we love him because
he first loved us. The design of the bounty of common providence to them
was that they might seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him
and find him, [Act 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#027.md). But they
sought him not; still he was to them an unknown God, and yet God was
found of them. 3. God gave the advantages of a divine revelation to
those who had never made a profession of religion: I said, Behold me,
behold me (gave them a sight of me and invited them to take the comfort
and benefit of it) to those who were not called by my name, as the Jews
for many ages had been. When the apostles went about from place to
place, preaching the gospel, this was the substance of what they
preached: "Behold God, behold him, turn towards him, fix the eyes of
your minds upon him, acquaint yourselves with him, admire him, adore
him; look off from your idols that you have made, and look upon the
living God who made you." Christ in them said, Behold me, behold me with
an eye of faith; look unto me, and be you saved. And this was said to
those that had long been lo-ammi, and lo-ruhamah ([Hos
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#008.md), [Hos
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#009).md), not a people, and that had not
obtained mercy, [Rom 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#025.md), [Rom
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#026.md).

II\. It is here foretold that the Jews, who had long been a people near
to God, should be cast off and set at a distance [Isa
65:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#002.md). The apostle applies this to the
Jews in his time, as a seed of evil-doers. [Rom
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#021.md), But to Israel he saith, All day
long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying
people. Here observe,

1\. How the Jews were courted to the divine grace. God himself, by his
prophets, by his Son, by his apostles, stretched forth his hands to
them, as Wisdom did, [Pro 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#024.md). God
spread out his hands to them, as one reasoning and expostulating with
them, not only beckoned to them with the finger, but spread out his
hands, as being ready to embrace and entertain them, reaching forth the
tokens of his favour to them, and importuning them to accept them. When
Christ was crucified his hands were spread out and stretched forth, as
if he were preparing to receive returning sinners into his bosom; and
this all the day, all the gospel-day. He waited to be gracious, and was
not weary of waiting; even those that came in at the eleventh hour of
the day were not rejected.

2\. How they contemned the invitation; it was given to a rebellious and
gainsaying people; they were invited to the wedding-supper, and would
not come, but rejected the counsel of God against themselves. Now here
we have,

(1.) The bad character of this people. The world shall see that it was
not for nothing that they were rejected of God; no, it was for their
whoredoms that they were put away.

\[1.\] Their character in general was such as one would not expect of
those who had been so much the favourites of Heaven. First, They were
very wilful. Right or wrong they would do as they had a mind. "They
generally walk on in a way that is not good, not the right way, not a
safe way, for they walk after their own thought, their own devices and
desires." If our guide be our own thoughts, our way is not likely to be
good; for every imagination of the thought of our hearts is only evil.
God had told them his thoughts, what his mind and will were, but they
would walk after their own thoughts, would do what they thought best.
Secondly, They were very provoking. This was God's complaint of them all
along - they grieved him, they vexed his Holy Spirit, as if they would
contrive how to make him their enemy: They provoke me to anger
continually to my face. They cared not what affront they gave to God,
though it were in his sight and presence, in a downright contempt of his
authority and defiance of his justice; and this continually; it had been
their way and manner ever since they were a people, witness the day of
temptation in the wilderness.

\[2.\] The prophet speaks more particularly of their iniquities and the
iniquities of their fathers, as the ground of God's casting them off,
[Isa 65:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#007.md). Now he gives instances of
both.

First, The most provoking iniquity of their fathers was idolatry; this,
the prophet tells them, was provoking God to his face; and it is an
iniquity which, as appears by the second commandment, God often visits
upon the children. This was the sin that brought them into captivity,
and, though the captivity pretty well cured them of it, yet, when the
final ruin of that nation came, that was again brought into the account
against them; for in the day when God visits he will visit that, [Exo
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#034.md). Perhaps there were many, long
after the captivity, who, though they did not worship other gods, were
yet guilty of the disorders here mentioned; for they married strange
wives. 1. They forsook God's temple, and sacrificed in gardens or
groves, that they might have the satisfaction of doing it in their own
way, for they liked not God's institutions. 2. They forsook God's altar,
and burnt incense upon bricks, altars of their own contriving (they
burnt incense according to their own inventions, which were of no more
value, in comparison with God's institution, than an altar of bricks in
comparison with the golden altar which God appointed them to burn
incense on), or upon tiles (so some read it), such as they covered their
flat-roofed houses with, and on them sometimes they burnt incense to
their idols, as appears, [Kg2 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#012.md),
where we read of altars on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, and
[Jer 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#013.md), of their burning incense
to the host of heaven upon the roofs of their houses. 3. "They used
necromancy, or consulting with the dead, and, in order to that, they
remained among the graves, and lodged in the monuments," to seek for the
living to the dead ([Jer 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#019).md), as the
witch of Endor. Or they used to consult the evil spirits that haunted
the sepulchres. 4. They violated the laws of God about their meat, and
broke through the distinction between clean and unclean before it was
taken away by the gospel. They ate swine's flesh. Some indeed chose
rather to die than to eat swine's flesh, as Eleazar and the seven
brethren in the story of the Maccabees; but it is probable that many ate
of it, especially when it came to be a condition of life. In our
Saviour's time we read of a vast herd of swine among them, which gives
us cause to suspect that there were many then who made so little
conscience of the law as to eat swine's flesh, for which they were
justly punished in the destruction of the swine. And the broth, or
pieces, of other forbidden meats, called here abominable things, was in
their vessels, and was made use of for food. The forbidden meat is
called an abomination, and those that meddle with it are said to make
themselves abominable, [Lev 11:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#042.md),
[Lev 11:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#043.md). Those that durst not eat
the meat yet made bold with the broth, because they would come as near
as might be to that which was forbidden, to show how they coveted the
forbidden fruit. Perhaps this is here put figuratively for all forbidden
pleasures and profits which are obtained by sin, that abominable thing
which the Lord hates; they loved to be dallying with it, to be tasting
of its broth. But those who thus take a pride in venturing upon the
borders of sin, and the brink of it, are in danger of falling into the
depths of it. But,

Secondly, The most provoking iniquity of the Jews in our Saviour's time
was their pride and hypocrisy, that sin of the scribes and Pharisees
against which Christ denounced so many woes, [Isa
65:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#005.md). They say, "Stand by thyself,
keep off" (get thee to thine, so the original is); "keep to thy own
companions, but come not near to me, lest thou pollute me; touch me not;
I will not allow thee any familiarity with me, for I am holier than
thou, and therefore thou art not good enough to converse with me; I am
not as other men are, nor even as this publican." This they were ready
to say to every one they met with, so that, in saying, I am holier than
thou, they thought themselves holier than any, not only very good, as
good as they should be, as good as they needed to be, but better than
any of their neighbours. These are a smoke in my nose (says God), such a
smoke as comes not from a quick fire, which soon becomes glowing and
pleasant, but from a fire of wet wood, which burns all the day, and is
nothing but smoke. Note, Nothing in men is more odious and offensive to
God than a proud conceit of themselves and contempt of others; for
commonly those are most unholy of all that think themselves holier than
any.

(2.) The controversy God had with them for this. The proof against them
is plain: Behold, it is written before me, [Isa
65:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#006.md). It is written, to be remembered
against them in time to come; for they may not perhaps be immediately
reckoned with. The sins of sinners, and particularly the vainglorious
boasts and scorns of hypocrites, are laid up in store with God, [Deu
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#034.md). And what is written shall be
read and proceeded upon: "I will not keep silence always, though I may
keep silence long." They shall not think him altogether such a one as
themselves, as sometimes they have done; but he will recompense, even
recompense into their bosom. Those basely abuse religion, that
honourable and sacred thing, who make their profession of it the matter
of their pride, and the jealous God will reckon with them for it; the
profession they boast of shall but serve to aggravate their
condemnation. \[1.\] The iniquity of their fathers shall come against
them; not but that their own sin deserved whatever judgments God brought
upon them, and much heavier; and this they owned, [Ezr
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#013.md). But God would not have wrought
so great a desolation upon them if he had not therein had an eye to the
sins of their fathers. Therefore in the last destruction of Jerusalem
God is said to bring upon them the blood of the Old Testament martyrs,
even that of Abel, [Mat 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035.md). God
will reckon with them, not only for their fathers' idols, but for their
high places, their burning incense upon the mountains and the hills,
though perhaps it was to the true God only. This was blaspheming or
reproaching God; it was a reflection upon the choice he had made of the
place where he would record his name, and the promise he had made that
there he would meet them and bless them. \[2.\] Their own with that
shall bring ruin upon them: Your iniquities and the iniquities of your
fathers together, the one aggravating the other, constitute the former
work, which, though it may seem to be overlooked and forgotten, shall be
measured into their bosom. God will render into the bosom, not only of
his open enemies ([Psa 79:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#012).md), but of
his false and treacherous friends, the reproach wherewith they have
reproached him.

[Isaiah 65:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 65:8</span></span>

This is expounded by St. Paul, [Rom
11:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001.md), where, when, upon occasion of
the rejection of the Jews, it is asked, Hath God then cast away his
people? he answers, No; for at this time there is a remnant according to
the election of grace. This prophecy has reference to that distinguished
remnant. When that hypocritical nation is to be destroyed God will
separate and secure to himself some from among them; some of the Jews
shall be brought to embrace the Christian faith, shall be added to the
church, and so be saved. And our Saviour has told us that for the sake
of these elect the days of the destruction of the Jews should be
shortened, and a stop put to the desolation, which otherwise would have
proceeded to such a degree that no flesh should be saved, [Mat
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#022.md). Now,

I. This is illustrated here by a comparison, [Isa
65:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#008.md). When a vine is so blasted and
withered that there seems to be no sap nor life in it, and therefore the
dresser of the vineyard is inclined to pluck it up or cut it down, yet,
if ever so little of the juice of the grape, fit to make new wine, be
found, though but in one cluster, a stander-by interposes, and says,
Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it; there is life in the root, and
hope that yet it may become good for something. Good men are blessings
to the places where they live; and sometimes God spares whole cities and
nations for the sake of a few such in them. How ambitious should we be
of this honor, not only to be distinguished from others, but serviceable
to others!

II\. Here is a description of those that shall make up this saved saving
remnant. 1. They are such as serve God. It is for my servants' sake
([Isa 65:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#008).md), and they are my servants
that shall dwell there, [Isa 65:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#009.md).
God's faithful servants, however they are looked upon, are the best
friends their country has; and those who serve him do therein serve
their generation. 2. They are such as seek God, make it the end of their
lives to glorify God and the business of their lives to call upon him.
It is for my people that have sought me. Those that seek God shall find
him, and shall find him their bountiful rewarder.

III\. Here is an account of the mercy God has in store for them. The
remnant that shall return out of captivity shall have a happy settlement
again in their own land, and that by an hereditary right, as a seed out
of Jacob, in whom the family is kept up and the entail preserved, and
from whom, as from the seed sown, shall spring a numerous increase; and
these typify the remnant of Jacob that shall be incorporated into the
gospel church by faith. 1. They shall have a good portion for
themselves. They shall inherit my mountains, the holy mountains on which
Jerusalem and the temple were built, or the mountains of Canaan, the
land of promise, typifying the covenant of grace, which all God's
servants, his elect, both inhabit and inherit; they make it their
refuge, their rest and residence, so they dwell in it, are at home in
it; and they have taken it to be their heritage for ever, and it shall
be to them an inheritance incorruptible. God's chosen, the spiritual
seed of praying Jacob, shall be the inheritors of his mountains of bliss
and joy, and shall be carried safely to them through the vale of tears.
2. They shall have a green pasture for their flocks, [Isa
65:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#010.md). Sharon and the valley of Achor
shall again be as well replenished as ever they were with cattle. Sharon
lay westward, near Joppa; Achor lay eastward, near Jordan. It is
therefore intimated that they shall recover the possession of the whole
land, that they shall have wherewith to stock it all, and that they
shall peaceably enjoy it and there shall be none to disturb them nor
make them afraid. Gospel-ordinances are the fields and valleys where the
sheep of Christ shall go in and out and find pasture ([Joh
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#009).md), and where they are made to lie
down ([Psa 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#002).md), as Israel's herds in
the valley of Achor, [Hos 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#015.md).

[Isaiah 65:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 65:11</span></span>

Here the different states of the godly and wicked, of the Jews that
believed and of those that still persisted in unbelief, are set the one
over - against the other, as life and death, good and evil, the blessing
and the curse.

I. Here is the fearful doom of those that persisted in their idolatry
after the deliverance out of Babylon, and in infidelity after the
preaching of the gospel of Christ. Observe,

1\. What the doom is that is here threatened: "I will number you to the
sword as sheep for the slaughter, and there shall be no escaping, no
standing out; you shall all bow down to it," [Isa
65:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#012). God's judgments come, (1..md)
Regularly, and are executed according to the commission. Those fall by
the sword that are numbered or counted out to it, and none besides.
Though the sword seems to devour promiscuously one as well as another,
yet it is made to know its number and shall not exceed. (2.)
Irresistibly. The strongest and most stout-hearted sinners shall be
forced to bow before them; for none ever hardened their hearts against
God and prospered.

2\. What the sins are that number them to the sword. (1.) Idolatry was
the ancient sin ([Isa 65:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#011).md): "You are
those who, instead of seeking me and serving me as my people, forsake
the Lord, disown him, and cast him off to embrace other gods, who forget
my holy mountain (the privileges it confers and the obligations it lays
you under) to burn incense upon the mountains of your idols ([Isa
65:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#007).md), and have deserted the one only
living and true God." They prepared a table for that troop of deities
which the heathen worship and poured out drink-offerings to that
numberless number of them; for those that thought one God too little
never thought scores and hundreds sufficient, but were still adding to
the number of them, till they had as many gods as cities and their
altars were as thick as heaps in the furrows of the field, [Hos
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011.md). Some take Gad and Meni, which
we translate a troop and a number, to be the proper names of two of
their idols, answering to Jupiter and Mercury. Whatever they were, their
worshippers spared no cost to do them honour; they prepared a table for
them, and filled out mixed wine for drink-offerings to them; they would
pinch their families rather than stint their devotions, which should
shame the worshippers of the true God out of their niggardliness. (2.)
Infidelity was the sin of the later Jews ([Isa
65:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#012).md): When I called, you did not
answer, which refers to the same that [Isa
65:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#002.md) did (I have stretched out my
hands to a rebellious people), and that is applied to those who rejected
the gospel. Our Lord Jesus himself called (he stood and cried, [Joh
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037).md), but they did not hear, they
would not answer; they were not convinced by his reasonings nor moved by
his expostulations; both the fair warnings he gave them of death and
ruin and the fair offers he made them of life and happiness were
slighted and made no impression upon them. Yet this was not all: You did
evil before my eyes, not by surprise, or through inadvertency, but with
deliberation: You did choose that wherein I delighted not; he means that
which he utterly detested and abhorred. It is not strange that those who
will not be persuaded to choose that which is good persist in their
choice and pursuit of that which is evil. See the malignity of sin; it
is evil in God's eyes, highly offensive to him, and yet it is committed
before his eyes, in his sight and presence, and in contempt of him; it
is likewise a contradiction to the will of God; it is doing that, of
choice, which we know will displease him.

II\. The aggravation of this doom, from the consideration of the happy
state of those that were brought to repentance and faith.

1\. The blessedness of those that serve God, and the woeful condition of
those that rebel against him, are here set the one over - against the
other, that they may serve as a foil to each other, [Isa
65:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#013). (1..md) God's servants may well
think themselves happy, and for ever indebted to that free grace which
made them so, when they see how miserable some of their neighbours are
for want of that grace, who are hardened, and likely to perish for ever
in unbelief, and what a narrow escape they had of being among them. See
[Isa 66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024). (2..md) It will add to the
grief of those that perish to see the happiness of God's servants (whom
they had hated, and vilified, and looked upon with the utmost disdain),
and especially to think that they might have shared in their bliss if it
had not been their own fault. It made the torment of the rich man in
hell the more grievous that he saw Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his
bosom, [Luk 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#023.md). See [Luk
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#028.md). Sometimes the providence of God
makes such a difference as this between good and bad in this world, and
the prosperity of the righteous becomes a grievous eye-sore and vexation
of heart to the wicked ([Psa 112:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#010).md),
and it will certainly be so in the great day. We fools counted his life
madness and his end without honour; but now how is he numbered with the
saints and his lot is among the chosen. Now,

2\. The difference of their states lies in two things: -

(1.) In point of comfort and satisfaction. \[1.\] God's servants shall
eat and drink; they shall have the bread of life to feed, to feast upon,
continually, shall be abundantly replenished with the goodness of his
house, and shall want nothing that is good for them. Heaven's happiness
will be to them an everlasting feast; they shall be filled with that
which now they hunger and thirst after. But those who set their hearts
upon the world, and place their happiness in that, shall be hungry and
thirsty, always empty, always craving; for it is not bread; it surfeits,
but it satisfies not. In communion with God, and dependence upon him,
there is full satisfaction; but in sinful pursuits there is nothing but
disappointment. \[2.\] God's servants shall rejoice and sing for joy of
heart. They have constant cause for joy, and there is nothing that may
be an occasion of grief to them but they have an allay sufficient for
it; and, as far as faith is in act and exercise, they have a heart to
rejoice, and their joy is their strength. They shall rejoice in their
hope, because it shall not make them ashamed. Heaven will be a world of
everlasting joy to all that are now sowing in tears. But, on the other
hand, those that forsake the Lord shut themselves out from all true joy,
for they shall be ashamed of their vain confidence in themselves, and
their own righteousness, and the hopes they had built thereon. When the
expectations of bliss wherewith they had flattered themselves are
frustrated, O what confusion will fill their faces! Then shall they cry
for sorrow of heart, and howl for vexation of spirit, perhaps in this
world, when their laughter shall be turned into mourning and their joy
into heaviness, and certainly in that world where the torment will be
endless, easeless, and remediless - nothing but weeping, and wailing,
and gnashing of teeth, to eternity. Let these two be compared, Now he is
comforted and thou art tormented, and which of the two will we choose to
take our lot with?

(2.) In point of honour and reputation, [Isa
65:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#015.md), [Isa
65:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#016.md). The memory of the just is, and
shall be, blessed, but the name of the wicked shall rot. \[1.\] The name
of the idolaters and unbelievers shall be left for a curse, shall be
loaded with ignominy and made for ever infamous. It shall be used in
giving bad characters - Thou art as cruel as a Jew; and in imprecation -
God make thee as miserable as a Jew. It shall be for a curse to God's
chosen, that is, for a warning to them; they shall be afraid of falling
under the curse upon the Jewish nation, of perishing after the same
example of unbelief. The curse of those whom God rejects should make his
chosen stand in awe. The Lord God shall slay thee; he shall quite
extirpate the Jews and cut them off from being a people; they shall no
longer live as a nation, nor ever be incorporated again. \[2.\] The name
of God's chosen shall become a blessing: He shall call his servants by
another name. The children of the covenant shall no longer be called
Jews, but Christians; and to them, under that name, all the promises and
privileges of the new covenant shall be secured. This other name shall
be an honourable name; it shall not be confined to one nation, but with
it men shall bless themselves in the earth, all the world over. God
shall have servants out of all nations who shall all be dignified with
this new name. They shall bless themselves in the God of truth. First,
They shall give honour to God both in their prayers and in their solemn
oaths, in their addresses for his favour as their felicity and their
appeals to his justice as their Judge. This is a part of the homage we
owe to God; we must bless ourselves in him, that is, we must reckon that
we have enough to make us happy, that we need no more, and can desire no
more, if we have him for our God. It is of great consequence what we
bless ourselves in, what we most please ourselves with and value
ourselves by our interest in. Worldly people bless themselves in the
abundance they have of this world's goods ([Psa
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#018.md); [Luk
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#019).md); but God's servants bless
themselves in him, as a God all-sufficient for them. He is their crown
of glory and diadem of beauty, their strength and portion. By him also
they shall swear, and not by any creature or any false god. To his
judgment they shall refer their cause, from whom every man's judgment
doth proceed. Secondly, They shall give honour to him as the God of
truth, the God of the Amen (so the word is); some understand it of
Christ who is himself the Amen, the faithful witness ([Rev
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014).md), and in whom all the promises
are yea and amen, [Co2 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020.md). In him we
must bless ourselves, and by him we must swear unto the Lord and
covenant with him. He that is blessed in the earth (so some read it)
shall be blessed in the true God, for Christ is the true God and eternal
life, [Jo1 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020.md). And it was promised
of old that in him all the families of the earth should be blessed, [Gen
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003.md). Some read it, He shall bless
himself in the God of the faithful people, in God as the God of all
believers, desiring no more than to share in the blessings wherewith
they are blessed, to be dealt with as he deals with them. Thirdly, They
shall give him honour as the author of this blessed change which they
have the experience of; they shall think themselves happy in having him
for their God who has made them to forget their former troubles, the
remembrance of them being swallowed up in their present comforts:
Because they are hidden from God's eyes, that is, they are quite taken
away; for, if there were any remainder of their troubles, God would be
sure to have his eye upon it, in compassion to them and concern for
them. They shall no longer feel them; for God will no longer see them.
He is pleased to speak as if he would make himself easy by making them
easy; and therefore they shall with a great deal of satisfaction bless
themselves in him.

[Isaiah 65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 65:17</span></span>

If these promises were in part fulfilled when the Jews, after their
return out of captivity, were settled in peace in their own land and
brought as it were into a new world, yet they were to have their full
accomplishment in the gospel church, militant first and at length
triumphant. The Jerusalem that is from above is free and is the mother
of us all. In the graces and comforts which believers have in and from
Christ we are to look for this new heaven and new earth. It is in the
gospel that old things have passed away and all things have become new,
and by it that those who are in Christ are new creatures, [Co2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017.md). It was a mighty and happy change
that was described [Isa 65:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#016.md), that
the former troubles were forgotten; but here it rises much higher: even
the former world shall be forgotten and shall no more come into mind.
Those that were converted to the Christian faith were so transported
with the comforts of it that all the comforts they were before
acquainted with became as nothing to them; not only their foregoing
griefs, but their foregoing joys, were lost and swallowed up in this.
The glorified saints will therefore have forgotten this world, because
they will be entirely taken up with the other: For, behold, I create new
heavens and a new earth. See how inexhaustible the divine power is; the
same God that created one heaven and earth can create another. See how
entire the happiness of the saints is; it shall be all of a piece; with
the new heavens God will create them (if they have occasion for it to
make them happy) a new earth too. The world is yours if you be Christ's,
[Co1 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#022.md). When God is reconciled to
us, which gives us a new heaven, the creatures too are reconciled to us,
which gives us a new earth. The future glory of the saints will be so
entirely different from what they ever knew before that it may well be
called new heavens and a new earth, [Pe2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013.md). Behold, I make all things new,
[Rev 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#005.md).

I. There shall be new joys. For, 1. All the church's friends, and all
that belong to her, shall rejoice ([Isa
65:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#018).md): You shall be glad and rejoice
for ever in that which I create. The new things which God creates in and
by his gospel are and shall be matter of everlasting joy to all
believers. My servants shall rejoice ([Isa
65:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#013).md), at last they shall, though now
they mourn. Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord. 2. The church shall be
the matter of their joy, so pleasant, so prosperous, shall her condition
be: I create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy. The church
shall not only rejoice but be rejoiced in. Those that have sorrowed with
the church shall rejoice with her. 3. The prosperity of the church shall
be a rejoicing to God himself, who has pleasure in the prosperity of his
servants ([Isa 65:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#019).md): I will rejoice
in Jerusalem's joy, and will joy in my people; for in all their
affliction he was afflicted. God will not only rejoice in the church's
well-doing, but will himself rejoice to do her good and rest in his love
to her, [Zep 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#017.md). What God rejoices
in it becomes us to rejoice in. 4. There shall be no allay of this joy,
nor any alteration of this happy condition of the church: The voice of
weeping shall be no more heard in her. If this relate to any state of
the church in this life, it means no more than that the former occasions
of grief shall not return, but God's people shall long enjoy an
uninterrupted tranquillity. But in heaven it shall have a full
accomplishment, in respect both of the perfection and the perpetuity of
the promised joy; there all tears shall be wiped away.

II\. There shall be new life, [Isa
65:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#020.md). Untimely deaths by the sword or
sickness shall be no more known as they have been, and by this means
there shall be no more the voice of crying, [Isa
65:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#019.md). When there shall be no more
death there shall be no more sorrow, [Rev
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004.md). As death has reigned by sin, so
life shall reign by righteousness, [Rom
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014.md), [Rom
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#021.md). 1. Believers through Christ
shall be satisfied with life, though it be ever so short on earth. If an
infant end its days quickly, yet it shall not be reckoned to die
untimely; for the shorter its life is the longer will its rest be.
Though death reign over those that have not sinned after the similitude
of Adam's transgression, yet they, dying in the arms of Christ, the
second Adam, and belonging to his kingdom, are not to be called infants
of days, but even the child shall be reckoned to die a hundred years
old, for he shall rise again at full age, shall rise to eternal life.
Some understand it of children who in their childhood are so eminent for
wisdom and grace, and by death nipped in the blossom, that they may be
said to die a hundred years old. And, as for old men, it is promised
that they shall fill their days with the fruits of righteousness, which
they shall still bring forth in old age, to show that the Lord is
upright, and then it is a good old age. An old man who is wise, and
good, and useful, may truly be said to have filled his days. Old men who
have their hearts upon the world have never filled their days, never
have enough of this world, but would still continue longer in it. But
that man dies old, and satur dierum - full of days, who, with Simeon,
having seen God's salvation, desires now to depart in peace. 2.
Unbelievers shall be unsatisfied and unhappy in life, though it be ever
so long. The sinner, though he live to a hundred years old, shall be
accursed. His living so long shall be no token to him of the divine
favour and blessing, nor shall it be any shelter to him from the divine
wrath and curse. The sentence he lies under will certainly be executed,
and his long life is but a long reprieve; nay, it is itself a curse to
him, for the longer he lives the more wrath he treasures up against the
day of wrath and the more sins he will have to answer for. So that the
matter is not great whether our lives on earth be long or short, but
whether we live the lives of saints or the lives of sinners.

III\. There shall be a new enjoyment of the comforts of life. Whereas
before it was very uncertain and precarious, their enemies inhabited the
houses which they built and ate the fruit of the trees which they
planted, now it shall be otherwise; they shall build houses and inhabit
them, shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them, [Isa
65:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#021.md), [Isa
65:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#022.md). Their intimates that the labour
of their hands shall be blessed and be made to prosper; they shall gain
what they aimed at, and what they have gained shall be preserved and
secured to them; they shall enjoy it comfortably, and nothing shall
embitter it to them, and they shall live to enjoy it long. Strangers
shall not break in upon them, to expel them, and plant themselves in
their room, as sometimes they have done: My elect shall wear out, or
long enjoy, the work of their hands; it is honestly got, and it will
wear well; it is the work of their hands, which they themselves have
laboured for, and it is most comfortable to enjoy that, and not to eat
the bread of idleness, or bread of deceit. If we have a heart to enjoy
it, that is the gift of God's grace ([Ecc
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#013).md); and, if we live to enjoy it
long, it is the gift of God's providence, for that is here promised: As
the days of a tree are the days of my people; as the days of an oak
([Isa 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#013).md), whose substance is in it,
though it cast its leaves; though it be stripped every winter, it
recovers itself again, and lasts many ages; as the days of the tree of
life; so the Septuagint. Christ is to them the tree of life, and in him
believers enjoy all those spiritual comforts which are typified by the
abundance of temporal blessings here promised; and it shall not be in
the power of their enemies to deprive them of these blessings or disturb
them in the enjoyment of them.

IV\. There shall be a new generation rising up in their stead to inherit
and enjoy these blessings ([Isa
65:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#023).md): They shall not labour in vain,
for they shall not only enjoy the work of their hands themselves, but
they shall leave it with satisfaction to those that shall come after
them, and not with such a melancholy prospect as Solomon did, [Ecc
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#018.md), [Ecc
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#019.md). They shall not beget and bring
forth children for trouble; for they are themselves the seed of the
blessed of the Lord, and there is a blessing entailed upon them by
descent from their ancestors which their offspring with them shall
partake of, and shall be, as well as they, the seed of the blessed of
the Lord. They shall not bring forth for trouble; for, 1. God will make
their children that rise up comforts to them; they shall have the joy of
seeing them walk in the truth. 2. He will make the times that come after
comfortable to their children. As they shall be good, so it shall be
well with them; they shall not be brought forth to days of trouble; nor
shall it ever be said, Blessed is the womb that bore not. In the gospel
church Christ's name shall be borne up by a succession. A seed shall
serve him ([Psa 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#030).md), the seed of
the blessed of the Lord.

V. There shall be a good correspondence between them and their God ([Isa
65:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#024).md): Even before they call, I will
answer. God will anticipate their prayers with the blessings of his
goodness. David did but say, I will confess, and God forgave, [Psa
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005.md). The father of the prodigal met
him in his return. While they are yet speaking, before they have
finished their prayer, I will give them the thing they pray for, or the
assurances and earnests of it. These are high expressions of God's
readiness to hear prayer; and this appears much more in the grace of the
gospel than it did under the law; we owe the comfort of it to the
mediation of Christ as our advocate with the Father and are obliged in
gratitude to give a ready ear to God's calls.

VI\. There shall be a good correspondence between them and their
neighbours ([Isa 65:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#025).md): The wolf and
the lamb shall feed together, as they did in Noah's ark. God's people,
though they are as sheep in the midst of wolves, shall be safe and
unhurt; for God will not so much break the power and tie the hands of
their enemies as formerly, but he will turn their hearts, will alter
their dispositions by his grace. When Paul, who had been a persecutor of
the disciples (and who, being of the tribe of Benjamin, ravened as a
wolf, [Gen 49:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#027).md) joined himself to
them and became one of them, then the wolf and the lamb fed together. So
also when the enmity between Jews and Gentiles was slain, all
hostilities ceased, and they fed together as one sheepfold under Christ
the great Shepherd, [Joh 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#016.md). The
enemies of the church ceased to do the mischief they had done, and its
members ceased to be so quarrelsome with and injurious to one another as
they had been, so that there was none either from without or from within
to hurt or destroy, none to disturb it, much less to ruin it, in all the
holy mountain; as was promised, [Isa
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009.md). For, 1. Men shall be changed:
The lion shall no more be a beast of prey, as perhaps he never would
have been if sin had not entered, but shall eat straw like the bullock,
shall know his owner, and his master's crib, as the ox does. When those
that lived by spoil and rapine, and coveted to enrich themselves, right
or wrong, are brought by the grace of God to accommodate themselves to
their condition, to live by honest labour, and to be content with such
things as they have - when those that stole steal no more, but work with
their hands the thing that is good - then this is fulfilled, that the
lion shall eat straw like the bullock. 2. Satan shall be chained, the
dragon bound; for dust shall be the serpent's meat again. That great
enemy, when he has been let loose, has glutted and regaled himself with
the precious blood of saints, who by his instigation have been
persecuted, and with the precious souls of sinners, who by his
instigation have become persecutors and have ruined themselves for ever;
but now he shall be confined to dust, according to the sentence, On thy
belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat, [Gen
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#014.md). All the enemies of God's church,
that are subtle and venomous as serpents, shall be conquered and
subdued, and be made to lick the dust, Christ shall reign as Zion's King
till all the enemies of his kingdom be made his footstool, and theirs
too. In the holy mountain above, and there only, shall this promise have
its full accomplishment, that there shall be none to hurt nor destroy.
