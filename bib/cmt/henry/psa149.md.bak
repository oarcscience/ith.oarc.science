### [Psalms Chapter 149](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 149:0</span></span>

The foregoing psalm was a hymn of praise to the Creator; this is a hymn
of praise to the Redeemer. It is a psalm of triumph in the God of
Israel, and over the enemies of Israel. Probably it was penned upon
occasion of some victory which Israel was blessed and honoured with.
Some conjecture that it was penned when David had taken the strong-hold
of Zion, and settled his government there. But it looks further, to the
kingdom of the Messiah, who, in the chariot of the everlasting gospel,
goes forth conquering and to conquer. To him, and his graces and
glories, we must have an eye, in singing this psalm, which proclaims, I.
Abundance of joy to all the people of God ([Psa
149:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001).md). II. Abundance of terror to
the proudest of their enemies ([Psa
149:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#006).md).

[Psalms 149:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 149:1</span></span>

We have here,

I. The calls given to God's Israel to praise. All his works were, in the
foregoing psalm, excited to praise him; but here his saints in a
particular manner are required to bless him. Observe then, 1. Who are
called upon to praise God. Israel in general, the body of the church
([Psa 149:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#002).md), the children of Zion
particularly, the inhabitants of that holy hill, who are nearer to God
than other Israelites; those that have the word and ordinances of God
near to them, that are not required to travel far to them, are justly
expected to do more in praising God than others. All true Christians may
call themselves the children of Zion, for in faith and hope we have come
unto Mount Zion, [Heb 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022.md). The
saints must praise God, saints in profession, saints in power, for this
is the intention of their sanctification; they are devoted to the glory
of God, and renewed by the grace of God, that they may be unto him for a
name and a praise. 2. What must be the principle of this praise, and
that is holy joy in God: Let Israel rejoice, and the children of Zion be
joyful, and the saints be joyful in glory. Our praises of God should
flow from a heart filled with delight and triumph in God's attributes,
and our relation to him. Much of the power of godliness in the heart
consists in making God our chief joy and solacing ourselves in him; and
our faith in Christ is described by our rejoicing in him. We then give
honour to God when we take pleasure in him. We must be joyful in glory,
that is, in him as our glory, and in the interest we have in him; and
let us look upon it as our glory to be of those that rejoice in God. 3.
What must be the expressions of this praise. We must by all proper ways
show forth the praises of God: Sing to the Lord. We must entertain
ourselves, and proclaim his name, by singing praises to him ([Psa
149:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#003).md), singing aloud ([Psa
149:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#005).md), for we should sing psalms with
all our heart, as those that are not only not ashamed of it, but are
enlarged in it. We must sing a new song, newly composed upon every
special occasion, sing with new affections, which make the song new,
though the words have been used before, and keep them from growing
threadbare. Let God be praised in the dance with timbrel and harp,
according to the usage of the Old Testament church very early ([Exo
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020).md), where we find God praised with
timbrels and dances. Those who from this urge the use of music in
religious worship must by the same rule introduce dancing, for they went
together, as in David's dancing before the ark, and [Jdg
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#021.md). But, whereas many scriptures in
the New Testament keep up singing as a gospel-ordinance, none provide
for the keeping up of music and dancing; the gospel-canon for psalmody
is to sing with the spirit and with the understanding. 4. What
opportunities must be taken for praising God, none must be let slip, but
particularly, (1.) We must praise God in public, in the solemn assembly
([Psa 149:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001).md), in the congregation of
saints. The more the better; it is the more like heaven. Thus God's name
must be owned before the world; thus the service must have a solemnity
put upon it, and we must mutually excite one another to it. The
principle, end, and design of our coming together in religious
assemblies is that we may join together in praising God. Other parts of
the service must be in order to this. (2.) We must praise him in
private. Let the saints be so transported with their joy in God as to
sing aloud upon their beds, when they awake in the night, full of the
praises of God, as David, [Psa 119:62](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#062.md).
When God's Israel are brought to a quiet settlement, let them enjoy
that, with thankfulness to God; much more may true believers, that have
entered into God's rest, and find repose in Jesus Christ, sing aloud for
joy of that. Upon their sick-beds, their death-beds, let them sing the
praises of their God.

II\. The cause given to God's Israel for praise. Consider, 1. God's
doings for them. They have reason to rejoice inn God, to devote
themselves to his honour and employ themselves in his service; for it is
he that made them. He gave us our being as men, and we have reason to
praise him for that, for it is a noble and excellent being. He gave
Israel their being as a people, as a church, made them what they were,
so very different from other nations. Let that people therefore praise
him, for he formed them for himself, on purpose that they might show
forth his praise, [Isa 43:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#021.md). Let
Israel rejoice in his Makers (so it is in the original); for God said,
Let us make man; and in this, some think, is the mystery of the Trinity.
2. God's dominion over them. This follows upon the former: if he made
them, he is their King; he that gave being no doubt may give law; and
this ought to be the matter of our joy and praise that we are under the
conduct and protection of such a wise and powerful King. Rejoice
greatly, O daughter of Zion! for behold thy king comes, the king
Messiah, whom God has set upon his holy hill of Zion; let all the
children of Zion be joyful in him, and go forth to meet him with their
hosannas, [Zac 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009.md). 3. God's delight
in them. he is a king that rules by love, and therefore to be praised;
for the Lord takes pleasure in his people, in their services, in their
prosperity, in communion with them, and in the communications of his
favour to them. He that is infinitely happy in the enjoyment of himself,
and to whose felicity no accession can be made, yet graciously
condescends to take pleasure in his people, [Psa
147:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#011.md). 4. God's designs concerning
them. Besides the present complacency he has in them, he has prepared
for their future glory: He will beautify the meek, the humble, and
lowly, and contrite in heart, that tremble at his word and submit to it,
that are patient under their afflictions and show all meekness towards
all men. These men vilify and asperse, but God will justify them, and
wipe off their reproach; nay, he will beautify them; they shall appear
not only clear, but comely, before all the world, with the comeliness
that he puts upon them. He will beautify them with salvation, with
temporal salvations (when God works remarkable deliverances for his
people those that had been among the pots become as the wings of a dove
covered with silver, [Psa 68:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#013).md), but
especially with eternal salvation. The righteous shall be beautified in
that day when they shine forth as the sun. In the hopes of this, let
them now, in the darkest day, sing a new song.

[Psalms 149:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 149:6</span></span>

The Israel of God are here represented triumphing over their enemies,
which is both the matter of their praise (let them give to God the glory
of those triumphs) and the recompence of their praise; those that are
truly thankful to God for their tranquillity shall be blessed with
victory. Or it may be taken as a further expression of their praise
([Psa 149:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#006).md): let the high praises of
God be in their mouth, and then, in a holy zeal for his honour, let them
take a two-edged sword in their hand, to fight his battles against the
enemies of his kingdom. Now this may be applied, 1. To the many
victories which God blessed his people Israel with over the nations of
Canaan and other nations that were devoted to destruction. These began
in Moses and Joshua, who, when they taught Israel the high praises of
the Lord, did withal put a two-edged sword in their hand; David did so
too, for, as he was the sweet singer of Israel, so he was the captain of
their hosts, and taught the children of Judah the use of the bow ([Sa2
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#018).md), taught their hands to war, as
God had taught his. Thus he and they went on victoriously, fighting the
Lord's battles, and avenging Israel's quarrels on those that had
oppressed them; then they executed vengeance upon the heathen (the
Philistines, Moabites, Ammonites, and others, [Sa2
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001), etc..md) and punishments upon the
people, for all the wrong they had done to God's people, [Psa
149:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#007.md). Their kings and nobles were
taken prisoners ([Psa 149:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#008).md) and on
some of them the judgment written was executed, as by Joshua on the
kings of Canaan, by Gideon on the princes of Midian, by Samuel on Agag.
The honour of this redounded to all the Israel of God; and to him who
put it upon them they return it entirely in their hallelujahs.
Jehoshaphat's army had at the same time the high praises of God in their
mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand, for they went forth to war
singing the praises of God, and then their sword did execution, [Ch2
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#023.md). Some apply it to the time of
the Maccabees, when the Jews sometimes gained great advantages against
their oppressors. And if it seem strange that the meek should,
notwithstanding that character, be thus severe, and upon kings and
nobles too, here is one word that justifies them in it; it is the
judgment written. They do not do it from any personal malice and
revenge, or any bloody politics that they govern themselves by, but by
commission from God, according to his direction, and in obedience to his
command; and Saul lost his kingdom for disobeying a command of this
nature. Thus the kings of the earth that shall be employed in the
destruction of the New Testament Babylon will but execute the judgment
written, [Rev 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#016.md), [Rev
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#017.md). But, since now no such special
commissions can be produced, this will by no means justify the violence
either of subjects against their princes or of princes against their
subjects, or both against their neighbours, under pretence of religion;
for Christ never intended that his gospel should be propagated by fire
and sword or his righteousness wrought by the wrath of man. When the
high praises of God are in our mouth with them we should have an
olive-branch of peace in our hands. 2. To Christ's victories by the
power of his gospel and grace over spiritual enemies, in which all
believers are more than conquerors. The word of God is the two-edged
sword ([Heb 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012).md), the sword of the
Spirit ([Eph 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#017).md), which it is not
enough to have in our armoury, we must have it in our hand also, as our
Master had, when he said, It is written. Now, (1.) With this two-edged
sword the first preachers of the gospel obtained a glorious victory over
the powers of darkness; vengeance was executed upon the gods of the
heathen, by the conviction and conversion of those that had been long
their worshippers, and by the consternation and confusion of those that
would not repent ([Rev 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#015).md); the
strongholds of Satan were cast down ([Ch2
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#004.md), [Ch2
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#005).md); great men were made to tremble
at the word, as Felix; Satan, the god of this world, was cast out,
according to the judgment given against him. This is the honour of all
Christians, that their holy religion has been so victorious. (2.) With
this two-edged sword believers fight against their own corruptions, and,
through the grace of God, subdue and mortify them; the sin that had
dominion over them is crucified; self, that once sat king, is bound with
chains and brought into subjection to the yoke of Christ; the tempter is
foiled and bruised under their feet. This honour have all the saints.
(3.) The complete accomplishment of this will be in the judgment of the
great day, when the Lord shall come with ten thousands of his saints, to
execute judgment upon all, [Jde 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014.md),
[Jde 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#015.md). Vengeance shall then be
executed upon the heathen ([Psa 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017).md),
and punishments, everlasting punishments, upon the people. Kings and
nobles, that cast away the bands and cords of Christ's government ([Psa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#003).md), shall not be able to cast away
the chains and fetters of his wrath and justice. Then shall be executed
the judgment written, for the secrets of men shall be judged according
to the gospel. This honour shall all the saints have, that, as assessors
with Christ, they shall judge the world, [Co1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#002.md). In the prospect of that let them
praise the Lord, and continue Christ's faithful servants and soldiers to
the end of their lives.
