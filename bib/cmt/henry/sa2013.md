### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 13:0</span></span>

The righteous God had lately told David, by Nathan the prophet, that, to
chastise him for his son in the matter of Uriah, he would "raise up evil
against him out of his own house," ([Sa2
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#011).md). And here, in the very next
chapter, we find the evil beginning to rise; henceforward he was
followed with one trouble after another, which made the latter part of
his reign less glorious and pleasant than the former part. Thus God
chastened him with the rod of men, yet assured him that his
"loving-kindness he would not utterly take away." Adultery and murder
were David's sins, and those sins among his children (Amnon defiling his
sister Tamar, and Absalom murdering his brother Amnon) were the
beginnings of his punishment, and the more grievous because he had
reason to fear that his bad example might help to bring them to these
wickednesses. In this chapter we have, I. Amnon ravishing Tamar,
assisted in his plot to do it by Jonadab his kinsman, and villainously
executing it (v. 1-20). II. Absalom murdering Amnon for it (v. 21-39).
Both were great griefs to David, and the more because he was unwittingly
made accessory to both, by sending Tamar to Amnon and Amnon to Absalom.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 13:1</span></span>

We have here a particular account of the abominable wickedness of Amnon
in ravishing his sister, a subject not fit to be enlarged upon nor
indeed to be mentioned without blushing, that ever any man should be so
vile, especially that a son of David should be so. Amnon's character, we
have reason to think, was bad in other things; if he had not forsaken
God, he would never have been given up to these vile affections. Godly
parents have often been afflicted with wicked children; grace does not
run in the blood, but corruption does. We do not find that David's
children imitated him in his devotion; but his false steps they trod in,
and in those did much worse, and repented not. Parents know not how
fatal the consequences may be if in any instance they give their
children bad examples. Observe the steps of Amnon's sin.

I. The devil, as an unclean spirit, put it into his heart to lust after
his sister Tamar. Beauty is a snare to many; it was so to her. She was
fair, and therefore Amnon coveted her, [Sa2
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#001.md). Those that are peculiarly
handsome have no reason, on that account, to be proud, but great reason
to stand upon their watch. Amnon's lust was, 1. Unnatural in itself, to
lust after his sister, which even natural conscience startles at and
cannot think of without horror. Such a spirit of contradiction there is
in man's corrupt nature that still it desires forbidden fruit, and the
more strongly it is forbidden the more greedily it is desired. Can he
entertain the thought of betraying that virtue and honour of which, as a
brother, he ought to have been the protector? But what wickedness so
vile as not to find admittance into an unsanctified unguarded heart,
left to itself? 2. It was very uneasy to him. He was so vexed that he
could not gain an opportunity to solicit her chastity (for innocent
converse with her was not denied him) that he fell sick, [Sa2
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#002.md). Fleshly lusts are their own
punishment, and not only war against the soul, but against the body too,
and are the rottenness of the bones. See what a hard master sinners
serve, and how heavy his yoke is.

II\. The devil, as a subtle serpent, put it into his head how to compass
this wicked design. Amnon had a friend (so he called him, but he was
really an enemy to him), a kinsman, that had in him more of David's
blood (for he was his nephew) than of David's spirit, for he was a
subtle man, cunning to carry on any bad design, especially an intrigue
of this nature, [Sa2 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#003.md).

1\. He took notice that Amnon looked ill, and, being a subtle man,
concluded that he was love-sick ([Sa2
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#004).md), and asks him, "Why art thou,
being the king's son, lean from day to day? Why dost thou pine, being
the king's eldest son, and heir to the crown. Being the king's son,"
(1.) "Thou hast the pleasures of the court to divert thee; take those
pleasures then, and with them drive away the sorrow, whatever it is."
Content and comfort are not always to be found in royal palaces. With
much more reason may we ask dejected and disconsolate saints why they,
who are the children of the King of kings and heirs of the crown of
life, are thus lean from day to day. (2.) "Thou hast the power of a
prince to command what thou wantest and wishest for; use that power
therefore, and gratify thyself. Pine not away for that which, lawful or
unlawful, thou, being the king's son, mayest have. Quicquid libet licet
- Your will is law." Thus Jezebel to Ahab in a like case ([Kg1
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#007).md), Dost not thou govern Israel?
The abuse of power is the most dangerous temptation of the great.

2\. Amnon having the impudence to own his wicked lust, miscalling it
love (I love Tamar), Jonadab put him in a way to compass his design,
[Sa2 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#005.md). Had he been what he
pretended (Amnon's friend), he would have startled at the mention of
such horrid wickedness, would have laid before him the evil of it, what
an offence it was to God and what a wrong to his own soul to entertain
such a vile thought, of what fatal consequence it would be to him to
cherish and prosecute it; he would have used his subtlety to divert
Amnon from it, by recommending some other person to him, whom he might
lawfully marry. But he seems not at all surprised at it, objects not
either the unlawfulness or the difficulty, the reproach or so much as
his father's displeasure, but puts him in the way to get Tamar to his
bed-side, and then he might do as he pleased. Note, The case of those is
very miserable whose friends, instead of admonishing and reproving them,
flatter them and forward them in their sinful ways, and are their
counsellors and contrivers to do wickedly. Amnon is already sick, but
goes about; he must take upon him to be so ill (and his thin looks will
give colour enough to the pretence) as not to be able to get up, and to
have no appetite to any thing but just that which pleases his fancy.
Dainty meat is abhorred, [Job 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#020.md).
The best dish from the king's table cannot please him; but, if he can
eat any thing, it must be from his sister Tamar's fair hand. This is
what he is advised to.

3\. Amnon followed these directions, and thus got Tamar within his
reach: He made himself sick, [Sa2
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#006.md). Thus he lieth in wait secretly,
as a lion in his den, to catch the poor, and to draw them into his net,
[Psa 10:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#008.md). David was always fond of
his children, and concerned if any thing ailed them; he no sooner hears
that Amnon is sick than he comes himself to visit him. Let parents learn
hence to be tender of their children and compassionate towards them. The
sick child commonly the mother comforteth ([Isa
66:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#013).md), but let not the father be
unconcerned. We may suppose that when David came to see his sick son he
gave him good counsel to make a right use of his affliction, and prayed
with him, which yet did not alter his wicked purpose. At parting, the
indulgent father asks, "Is there any thing thou hast a mind to, that I
can procure for thee?" "Yes, Sir," says the dissembling son, "my stomach
is weak, and I know not of any thing I can eat, unless it be a cake of
my sister Tamar's making, and I cannot be satisfied that it is so unless
I see her make it, and it will do me the more good if I eat it at her
hand." David saw no reason to suspect any mischief intended. God hid his
heart from understanding in this matter. He therefore immediately orders
Tamar to go and attend her sick brother, [Sa2
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#007.md). He does it very innocently, but
afterwards, no doubt, reflected upon it with great regret. Tamar as
innocently goes to her brother's chamber, neither dreading any abuse
(why should she from a brother, a sick brother?) nor disdaining, in
obedience to her father and love to her brother (though but her
half-brother), to be his nurse, [Sa2
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#008.md), [Sa2
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#009.md). Though she was a king's
daughter, a great beauty ([Sa2 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#001).md),
and well dressed ([Sa2 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#018).md), yet she
did not think it below her to knead cakes and bake them, nor would she
have done this now if she had not been used to it. Good house-wifery is
not a thing below the greatest ladies, nor ought they to think it a
disparagement to them. The virtuous woman, whose husband sits among the
elders, yet works willingly with her hands, [Pro
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#013.md). Modern ages have not been
destitute of such instances, nor is it so unfashionable as some would
make it. Preparing for the sick should be more the care and delight of
the ladies than preparing for the nice, charity more than curiosity.

4\. Having got her to him, he contrives to have her alone; for the
adulterer (much more so vile an adulterer as this) is in care that no
eye see him, [Job 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#015.md). The meat is
ready, but he cannot eat while he is looked at by those about him; they
must all be turned out, [Sa2 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#009.md). The
sick must be humoured, and think they have a privilege to command. Tamar
is willing to humour him; her chaste and virtuous soul has not the least
thought of that which his polluted breast is full of; and therefore she
makes no scruple of being alone with him in the inner chamber, [Sa2
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#010.md). And now the mask is thrown off,
the meat is thrown by, and the wicked wretch calls her sister, and yet
impudently courts her to come and lie with him, [Sa2
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#011.md). It was a base affront to her
virtue to think it possible to persuade her to consent to such
wickedness when he knew her behaviour to be always exemplarily modest
and virtuous. But it is common for those that live in uncleanness to
think others such as themselves, at least tinder to their sparks.

III\. The devil, as a strong tempter, deafens his ear to all the
reasonings with which she resisted his assaults and would have persuaded
him to desist. We may well imagine what a surprise and terror it was to
the young lady to be thus attacked, how she blushed and how she
trembled; yet, in this great confusion, nothing could be said more
pertinently, nor with greater strength of argument, than what she said
to him. 1. She calls him brother, reminding him of the nearness of the
relation, which made it unlawful for him to marry her, much more to
debauch her. It was expressly forbidden ([Lev
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#009).md) under a severe penalty, [Lev
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#017.md). Great care must be taken lest
the love that should be among relations degenerate into lust. 2. She
entreats him not to force her, which intimates that she would never
consent to it in any degree; and what satisfaction could he take in
offering violence? 3. She lays before him the great wickedness of it. It
is folly; all sin is so, especially uncleanness. It is wickedness of the
worst kind. Such abominations ought not to be committed in Israel, among
the professing people of God, that have better statutes than the heathen
have. We are Israelites; if we do such things, we are more inexcusable
than others, and our condemnation will be more intolerable, for we
reproach the Lord, and that worthy name by which we are called. 4. She
represents to him the shame of it, which perhaps might influence him
more than the sin of it: "For my part, whither shall I cause my shame to
go? If it should be concealed, yet I shall blush to think of it as long
as I live; and, if ever it be known, how shall I be able to look any of
my friends in the face? For thy part, thou shalt be as one of the fools
in Israel," that is, "Thou wilt be looked upon as an atrocious
debauchee, the worst of men; thou wilt lose thy interest in the esteem
of all that are wise and good, and so wilt be set aside as unfit to
rule, though the first-born; for Israel will never submit to the
government of such a fool." Prospect of shame, especially everlasting
shame, should deter us from sin. 5. To divert him from his wicked
purpose at this time, and (if possible) to get clear of him, she
intimates to him that probably the king, rather than he should die for
love of her, would dispense with the divine law and let him marry her:
not as if she thought he had such a dispensing power, or would pretend
to it; but she was confident that, upon notice given to the king by
himself of this wicked desire, which he would scarcely have believed
from any one else, he would take an effectual course to protect her from
him. But all her arts and all her arguments availed not. His proud
spirit cannot bear a denial; but her comfort, and honour, and all that
was dear to her, must be sacrificed to his brutish and outrageous lust,
[Sa2 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#014.md). It is to be feared that
Amnon, though young, had long lived a lewd life, which his father either
knew not or punished not; for a man could not, of a sudden, arrive at
such a pitch of wickedness as this. But is this his love to Tamar? Is
this the recompence he gives her for her readiness to attend him in his
sickness? Will he deal with his sister as with a harlot? Base villain!
God deliver all that are modest and virtuous from such wicked and
unreasonable men.

IV\. The devil, as a tormentor and betrayer, immediately turns his love
of her into hatred ([Sa2 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#015).md): He
hated her with great hatred, greatly, so it is in the margin, and grew
as outrageous in his malice as he had been in his lust.

1\. He basely turned her out of doors by force; nay, as if he now
disdained to touch her with his own hands, he ordered his servant to
pull her out and bolt the door after her, [Sa2
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#017). Now, (1..md) The innocent injured
lady had reason to resent this as a great affront, and in some respects
(as she says, [Sa2 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#016).md) worse than
the former; for nothing could have been done more barbarous and
ill-natured, or more disgraceful to her. Had he taken care to conceal
what was done, her honour would have been lost to herself only. Had he
gone down on his knees and begged her pardon, it might have been some
little reparation. Had he given her time to compose herself after the
horrid confusion she was put into, she might have kept her countenance
when she went out, and so have kept her counsel. But to dismiss her thus
hurried, thus rudely, as if she had done some wicked thing, obliged her,
in her own defence, to proclaim the wrong that had been done her. (2.)
We may learn from it both the malignity of sin (unbridled passions are
as bad as unbridled appetites) and the mischievous consequences of sin
(at last, it bites like a serpent); for here we find, \[1.\] That sins,
sweet in the commission, afterwards become odious and painful, and the
sinner's own conscience makes them so to himself. Amnon hated Tamar
because she would not consent to his wickedness, and so take part of the
blame upon herself, but to the last resisted it, and reasoned against
it, and so threw all the blame upon him. Had he hated the sin, and
loathed himself for it, we might have hoped he was penitent. Godly
sorrow worketh indignation, [Co2 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011.md).
But to hate the person he had abused showed that his conscience was
terrified, but his heart not at all humbled. See what deceitful
pleasures those of the flesh are, how soon they pass away, and turn into
loathing; see [Eze 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#017.md). \[2.\] That
sins, secret in the commission, afterwards become open and public, and
the sinners themselves often make them so. Their own tongues fall upon
them. The Jewish doctors say that, upon the occasion of this wickedness
of Amnon, a law was made that a young man and a young woman should never
be alone together; for, said they, if the king's daughter be so used,
what will become of the children of private men?

2\. We must now leave the criminal to the terrors of his own guilty
conscience, and enquire what becomes of the poor victim. (1.) She
bitterly lamented the injury she had received, as it was a stain to her
honour, though no real blemish to her virtue. She tore her fine clothes
in token of her grief, and put ashes upon her head, to deform herself,
loathing her own beauty and ornaments, because they had occasioned
Amnon's unlawful love; and she went on crying for another's sin, [Sa2
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#019). (2..md) She retired to her brother
Absalom's house, because he was her own brother, and there she lived in
solitude and sorrow, in token of her modesty and detestation of
uncleanness. Absalom spoke kindly to her, bade her pass by the injury
for the present, designing himself to revenge it, [Sa2
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#020.md). It should seem by Absalom's
question (Has Amnon been with thee?) that Amnon was notorious for such
lewd practices, so that it was dangerous for a modest woman to be with
him; this Absalom might know, and yet Tamar be wholly ignorant of it.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 13:21</span></span>

What Solomon says of the beginning of strife is as true of the beginning
of all sin, it is as the letting forth of water; when once the
flood-gates are plucked up, an inundation follows; one mischief begets
another, and it is hard to say what shall be in the end thereof.

I. We are here told how David resented the tidings of Amnon's sin: He
was very wroth, [Sa2 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#021.md). So he had
reason to be, that his own son should do such a wicked thing and draw
him to be accessory to it. It would be a reproach to him for not giving
him a better education; it would be a blot upon his family, the ruin of
his daughter, a bad example to his kingdom, and a wrong to his son's
soul. But was it enough for him to be angry? He ought to have punished
his son for it, and have put him to open shame; both as a father and as
a king he had power to do it. But the Septuagint here adds these words:
But he saddened not the spirit of his son Amnon, because he loved him,
because he was his first-born. He fell into Eli's error, whose sons made
themselves vile, and he frowned not on them. If Amnon was dear to him,
his punishing him would have been so much the greater punishment to
himself for his own uncleanness. But he cannot bear the shame those must
submit to who correct that in others which they are conscious of in
themselves, and therefore his anger must serve instead of his justice;
and this hardens sinners, [Ecc 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011.md).

II\. How Absalom resented it. He resolves already to do the part of a
judge in Israel; and, since his father will not punish Amnon, he will,
from a principle, not of justice or zeal for virtue, but of revenge,
because he reckons himself affronted in the abuse done to his sister.
Their mother was daughter to a heathen prince ([Sa2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#003).md), which perhaps they were
upbraided with sometimes by their brethren, as children of a stranger.
As such a one Absalom thought his sister was now treated; and, if Amnon
thought her fit to be made his harlot, he would think him fit to be made
his slave. This enraged him, and nothing less than the blood of Amnon
will quench his rage. Here we have,

1\. The design conceived: Absalom hated Amnon ([Sa2
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#022).md), and he that hateth his brother
is a murderer already, and, like Cain, is of that wicked one, [Jo1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#012.md), [Jo1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#015.md). Absalom's hatred of his
brother's crime would have been commendable, and he might justly have
prosecuted him for it by a due course of law, for example to others, and
the making of some compensation to his injured sister; but to hate his
person, and design his death by assassination, was to put a great
affront upon God, by offering to repair the breach of his seventh
commandment by the violation of his sixth, as if they were not all alike
sacred. But he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not
kill, [Jam 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#011.md).

2\. The design concealed. He said nothing to Amnon of this matter,
either good or bad, appeared as if he did not know it, and maintained
towards him his usual civility, only waiting for a fair opportunity to
do him a mischief. That malice is the worst, (1.) Which is hidden
closely, and has no vent given to it. If Absalom had reasoned the matter
with Amnon, he might have convinced him of his sin and brought him to
repentance; but, saying nothing, Amnon's heart was hardened, and his own
more and more embittered against him; therefore rebuking our neighbour
is opposed to hating him in our hearts, [Lev
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#017.md). Let passion have vent and it
will spend itself. (2.) Which is gilded over with a show of friendship;
so Absalom's was, his words smoother than butter but war in his heart.
See [Pro 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#026). (3..md) Which is
harboured long. Two full years Absalom nursed this root of bitterness,
[Sa2 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#024.md). It may be, at first, he
did not intend to kill his brother (for, if he had, he might have had as
fair an opportunity to do it as he had at last), and only waited for an
occasion to disgrace him or do him some other mischief; but in time his
hatred ripened to this, that he would be no less than the death of him.
If the sun going down once upon the wrath gives such place to the devil
(as is intimated, [Eph 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#026.md), [Eph
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#027).md), what would the sunsets of two
full years do?

3\. The design laid. (1.) Absalom has a feast at his house in the
country, as Nabal had, on occasion of his sheep-shearing, [Sa2
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#023.md). Attentive as Absalom was to his
person ([Sa2 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#026).md), and as high as he
looked, he knew the state of his flocks and looked well to his herds.
Those who have no other care about their estates in the country than how
to spend them in the town take a ready way to see the end of them. When
Absalom had sheep-shearers he would himself be with them. (2.) To this
feast he invites the king his father, and all the princes of the blood
([Sa2 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#024).md), not only that he might
have this opportunity to pay his respects to them, but that he might
make himself the more respected among his neighbours. Those that are
akin to great folks are apt to value themselves too much on their
kindred. (3.) The king would not go himself, because he would not put
him to the expense of his entertainment, [Sa2
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#025.md). It seems Absalom had an estate
in his own hands, on which he lived like himself; the king had given it
to him, but would have him to be a good husband of it: in both these he
is an example to parents, when their children have grown up, to give
them a competency to live upon, according to their rank, and then to
take care that they do not live above it, especially that they be no way
accessory to their doing so. It is prudent for young house-keepers to
begin as they can hold out, and not to spend the wool upon the shearing
of it. (4.) Absalom got leave for Amnon, and all the rest of the king's
sons, to come and grace his table in the country, [Sa2
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#026.md), [Sa2
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#027.md). Absalom had so effectually
concealed his enmity to Amnon that David saw no reason to suspect any
design upon him in that particular invitation: "Let my brother Amnon
go;" but this would make the stroke more cutting to David that he was
himself drawn in to consent to that which gave the opportunity for it,
as before, [Sa2 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#007.md). It seems,
David's sons, though grown up, continued to pay such a deference to
their father as not to go such a small journey as this without leave.
Thus ought children, even when they have become men and women, to honour
their parents, consult them, and do nothing material without their
consent, much less against their mind.

4\. The design executed, [Sa2 13:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#028.md),
[Sa2 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#029). (1..md) Absalom's
entertainment was very plentiful; for he resolves that they shall all be
merry with wine, at least concludes that Amnon will be so, for he knew
that he was apt to drink to excess. But, (2.) The orders he gave to his
servants concerning Amnon, that they should mingle his blood with his
wine, were very barbarous. Had he challenged him, and, in reliance upon
the goodness of his cause and the justice of God, fought him himself,
though that would have been bad enough, yet it would have been more
honourable and excusable (our ancient law, in some cases, allowed trial
by battle); but to murder him, as he did, was to copy Cain's example,
only that the reason made a difference: Abel was slain for his
righteousness, Amnon for his wickedness. Observe the aggravations of
this sin: - \[1.\] He would have Amnon slain when his heart was merry
with wine, and he was consequently least apprehensive of danger, least
able to resist it, and also least fit to go out of the world; as if his
malice aimed to destroy both soul and body, not giving him time to say,
Lord, have mercy upon me. What a dreadful surprise hath death been to
many, whose hearts have been overcharged with surfeiting and
drunkenness! \[2.\] His servants must be employed to do it, and so
involved in the guilt. He was to give the word of command - Smite Amnon;
and then they, in obedience to him, and, upon presumption that his
authority would bear them out, must kill him. What an impious defiance
does he bid to the divine law, when, though the command of God is
express, Thou shalt not kill, he bids them kill Amnon, with this
warrant, "Have not I commanded you? That is enough. Be courageous, and
fear neither God nor man." Those servants are ill taught who obey their
masters in contradiction to God, and those are wicked masters who have
taught them to do so. Those are too obsequious that will damn their
souls to please their masters, whose big words cannot secure them from
God's wrath. Masters must always command their servants as those that
know they also have a Master in heaven. \[3.\] He did it in the presence
of all the king's sons, of whom it is said ([Sa2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018).md) that they were chief rulers; so
that it was an affront to public justice which they had the
administration of, and to the king his father whom they represented, and
a contempt of that sword which should have been a terror to his evil
deeds, while his evil deeds, on the contrary, were a terror to those
that bore it. \[4.\] There is reason to suspect that Absalom did this,
not only to revenge his sister's quarrel, but to make way for himself to
the throne, which he was ambitious of, and which he would stand fair for
if Amnon the eldest son was taken off. When the word of command was
given Absalom's servants failed not to execute it, being buoyed up with
an opinion that their master, being now next heir to the crown (for
Chileab was dead, as bishop Patrick thinks), would save them from harm.
Now the threatened sword is drawn in David's house which should not
depart from it. First, His eldest son falls by it, himself being, by his
wickedness, the cause of it, and his father, by his connivance,
accessory to it. Secondly, All his sons flee from it, and come home in
terror, not knowing how far their brother Absalom's bloody design might
extend. See what mischief sin makes in families.

Here is, I. The fright that David was put into by a false report brought
to Jerusalem that Absalom had slain all the king's sons, [Sa2
13:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#030.md). It is common for fame to make
bad worse; and the first news of such a thing as this represents it as
more dreadful than afterwards it proves. Let us not therefore be afraid
of evil tidings, while they want confirmation, but, when we hear the
worst, hope the best, at least hope better. However, this false news
gave as much affliction to David, for the present, as if it had been
true; he tore his garments, and lay on the earth, while as yet it was
only a flying story, [Sa2 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#031.md). It
was well that David had grace; he had need enough of it, for he had
strong passions.

II\. The rectifying of the mistake in two ways: - 1. By the sly
suggestions of Jonadab, David's nephew, who could tell him, Amnon only
is dead, and not all the king's sons ([Sa2
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#032.md), [Sa2
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#033).md), and could tell him too that it
was done by the appointment of Absalom, and designed from the day Amnon
forced his sister Tamar. What a wicked man was he, if he knew all this
or had any cause to suspect it, that he did not make David acquainted
with it sooner, that means might be used to make up the quarrel, or at
least that David might not throw Amnon into the mouth of danger by
letting him go to Absalom's house. If we do not our utmost to prevent
mischief, we make ourselves accessory to it. If we say, Behold, we knew
it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider whether we did or
no? See [Pro 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#011.md), [Pro
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#012.md). It is well if Jonadab was not
as guilty of Amnon's death as he was of his sin; such friends do those
prove who are hearkened to as counsellors to do wickedly: he that would
not be so kind as to prevent Amnon's sin would not be so kind as to
prevent his ruin, when, it should seem, he might have done both. 2. By
the safe return of all the king's sons except Amnon. They and their
attendants were speedily discovered by the watch ([Sa2
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#034.md), [Sa2
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#035).md), and soon arrived, to show
themselves alive, but to bring the certain sad news that Absalom had
murdered their brother Amnon. The grief David had been in for that which
was not made him the better able to bear that which was, by giving him a
sensible occasion, when he was undeceived, to thank God that all his
sons were not dead: yet that Amnon was dead, and slain by his own
brother is such a treacherous barbarous manner, was enough to put the
king and court, the king and kingdom, into real mourning. Sorrow is
never more reasonable than when there is sin in the case.

III\. Absalom's flight from justice: Absalom immediately fled, [Sa2
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#034.md). He was now as much afraid of
the king's sons as they were of him; they fled from his malice, he from
their justice. No part of the land of Israel could shelter him. The
cities of refuge gave no protection to a wilful murderer. Though David
had let Amnon's incest go unpunished, Absalom could not promise himself
his pardon for this murder; so express was the law in this case, and so
well known David's justice, and his dread of blood-guiltiness. He
therefore made the best of his way to his mother's relations, and was
entertained by his grandfather Talmai, king of Geshur ([Sa2
13:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#037).md), and there he was protected
three years ([Sa2 13:38](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#038).md), David not
demanding him, and Talmai not thinking himself obliged to send him back
unless he were demanded.

IV\. David's uneasiness for his absence. He mourned for Amnon a good
while ([Sa2 13:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#037).md), but, he being past
recall, time wore off that grief: he was comforted concerning Amnon. It
also wore off too much his detestation of Absalom's sin; instead of
loathing him as a murderer, he longs to go forth to him, [Sa2
13:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#039.md). At first he could not find in
his heart to do justice on him; now he can almost find in his heart to
take him into his favour again. This was David's infirmity. Something
God saw in his heart that made a difference, else we should have thought
that he, as much as Eli, honoured his sons more than God.
