### [Nehemiah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">neh 4:0</span></span>

We left all hands at work for the building of the wall about Jerusalem.
But such good work is not wont to be carried on without opposition; now
here we are told what opposition was given to it, and what methods
Nehemiah took to forward the work, notwithstanding that opposition. I.
Their enemies reproached and ridiculed their undertaking, but their
scoffs they answered with prayers: they heeded them not, but went on
with their work notwithstanding ([Neh
4:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#001).md). II. They formed a bloody
design against them, to hinder them by force of arms ([Neh
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#007.md), [Neh
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#008.md), [Neh
4:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#010).md). To guard against this
Nehemiah prayed ([Neh 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#009).md), set guards
([Neh 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#013).md), and encouraged them to
fight ([Neh 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#014).md), by which the design
was broken ([Neh 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#015).md), and so the
work was carried on with all needful precaution against a surprise ([Neh
4:16-23](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#016).md). In all this Nehemiah
approved himself a man of great wisdom and courage, as well as great
piety.

[Nehemiah 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 4:1</span></span>

Here is, I. The spiteful scornful reflection which Sanballat and Tobiah
cast upon the Jews for their attempt to build the wall about Jerusalem.
The country rang of it presently; intelligence was brought of it to
Samaria, that nest of enemies to the Jews and their prosperity; and here
we are told how they received the tidings. 1. In heart. They were very
angry at the undertaking, and had great indignation, [Neh
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#001.md). It vexed them that Nehemiah came
to seek the welfare of the children of Israel ([Neh
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#010).md); but, when they heard of this
great undertaking for their good, they were out of all patience. They
had hitherto pleased themselves with the thought that while Jerusalem
was unwalled they could swallow it up and make themselves masters of it
when they pleased; but, if it be walled, it will not only be fenced
against them, but by degrees become formidable to them. The strength and
safety of the church are the grief and vexation of its enemies. 2. In
word. They despised it, and made it the subject of their ridicule. In
this they sufficiently displayed their malice; but good was brought out
of it; for, looking upon it as a foolish undertaking that would sink
under its own weight, they did not go about to obstruct it till it was
too late. Let us see with what pride and malice they set themselves
publicly to banter it. (1.) Sanballat speaks with scorn of the workmen:
"These feeble Jews" ([Neh 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#002).md), "what
will they do for materials? Will they revive the stones out of the
rubbish? And what mean they by being so hasty? Do they think to make the
walling of a city but one day's work, and to keep the feast of
dedication with sacrifice the next day? Poor silly people! See how
ridiculous they make themselves!" (2.) Tobiah speaks with no less scorn
of the work itself. He has his jest too, and must show his wit, [Neh
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#003.md). Profane scoffers sharpen one
another. "Sorry work," says he, "they are likely to make of it; they
themselves will be ashamed of it: If a fox go up, not with his subtlety,
but with his weight, he will break down their stone wall." Many a good
work has been thus looked upon with contempt by the proud and haughty
scorners.

II\. Nehemiah's humble and devout address to God when he heard of these
reflections. He had notice brought him of what they said. It is probable
that they themselves sent him a message to this purport, to discourage
him, hoping to jeer him out of his attempt; but he did not answer these
fools according to their folly; he did not upbraid them with their
weakness, but looked up to God by prayer.

1\. He begs of God to take notice of the indignities that were done them
([Neh 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#004).md), and in this we are to
imitate him: Hear, O our God! for we are despised. Note, (1.) God's
people have often been a despised people, and loaded with contempt. (2.)
God does, and will, hear all the slights that are put upon his people,
and it is their comfort that he does so and a good reason why they
should be as though they were deaf, [Psa
38:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#013.md), [Psa
38:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#015.md). "Thou art our God to whom we
appeal; our cause needs no more than a fair hearing."

2\. He begs of God to avenge their cause and turn the reproach upon the
enemies themselves ([Neh 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#004.md), [Neh
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#005).md); and this was spoken rather by a
spirit of prophecy than by a spirit of prayer, and is not to be imitated
by us who are taught of Christ to pray for those that despitefully use
and persecute us. Christ himself prayed for those that reproached him:
Father, forgive them. Nehemiah here prays, Cover not their iniquity.
Note, (1.) Those that cast contempt on God's people do but prepare
everlasting shame for themselves. (2.) It is a sin from which sinners
are seldom recovered. Doubtless Nehemiah had reason to think the hearts
of those sinners were desperately hardened, so that they would never
repent of it, else he would not have prayed that it might never be
blotted out. The reason he gives is not, They have abused us, but, They
have provoked thee, and that before the builders, to whom, it is likely,
they sent a spiteful message. Note, We should be angry at the malice of
persecutors, not because it is abusive to us, but because it is
offensive to God; and on that we may ground an expectation that God will
appear against it, [Psa 74:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#018.md), [Psa
74:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#022.md).

III\. The vigour of the builders, notwithstanding these reflections,
[Neh 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#006.md). They made such good speed
that in a little time they had run up the wall to half its height, for
the people had a mind to work; their hearts were upon it, and they would
have it forwarded. Note, 1. Good work goes on well when people have a
mind to it. 2. The reproaches of enemies should rather quicken us to our
duty than drive us from it.

[Nehemiah 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">neh 4:7</span></span>

We have here,

I. The conspiracy which the Jews' enemies formed against them, to stay
the building by slaying the builders. The conspirators were not only
Sanballat and Tobiah, but other neighbouring people whom they had drawn
into the plot. They flattered themselves with a fancy that the work
would soon stand still of itself; but, when they heard that it went on a
prospered, they were angry at the Jews for being so hasty to push the
work forward and angry at themselves for being so slow in opposing it
([Neh 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#007).md): They were very wroth.
Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce, and their wrath, for it was
cruel. Nothing would serve but they would fight against Jerusalem, [Neh
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#008.md). Why, what quarrel had they with
the Jews? Had they done them any wrong? Or did they design them any? No,
they lived peaceably by them; but it was merely out of envy and malice;
they hated the Jews' piety, and were therefore vexed at their prosperity
and sought their ruin. Observe, 1. How unanimous they were: They
conspired all of them together, though of different interests among
themselves, yet one in their opposition to the work of God. 2. How close
they were; they said, "They shall not know, neither see, till we have
them at our mercy." Thus they took crafty counsel, and digged deep to
hide it from the Lord, and promised themselves security and success from
the secresy of their management. 3. How cruel they were: We will come
and slay them. If nothing less than the murder of the workmen will put a
stop to the work, they will not stick at that; nay, it is their blood
they thirst for, and they are glad of any pretence to glut themselves
with it. 4. What the design was and how confident they were of success:
it was to cause the work to cease ([Neh
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#011).md), and this they were confident
that they should effect. The hindering of good work is that which bad
men aim at and promise themselves; but good work is God's work, and it
shall prosper.

II\. The discouragements which the builders themselves laboured under.
At the very time when the adversaries said, Let us cause the work to
cease, Judah said, "Let us even let it fall, for we are not able to go
forward with it," [Neh 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#010.md). They
represent the labourers as tired, and the remaining difficulties, even
of that first part of their work, the removing of the rubbish, as
insuperable, and therefore they think it advisable to desist for the
present. Can Judah, that warlike valiant tribe, sneak thus? Active
leading men have many times as much ado to grapple with the fears of
their friends as with the terrors of their enemies.

III\. The information that was brought to Nehemiah of the enemies'
designs, [Neh 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#012.md). There were Jews
that dwelt by them, in the country, who, though they had not zeal enough
to bring them to Jerusalem to help their brethren in building the wall,
yet, having by their situation opportunity to discover the enemies'
motions, had so much honesty and affection to the cause as to give
intelligence of them; nay, that their intelligence might be the more
credited, they came themselves to give it, and they said it ten times,
repeating it as men in earnest, and under a concern, and the report was
confirmed by many witnesses. The intelligence they gave is expressed
abruptly, and finds work for the critics to make out the sense of it,
which perhaps is designed to intimate that they gave this intelligence
as men out of breath and in confusion, whose very looks would make up
the deficiencies of their words. I think it may be read, without
supplying any thing: "Whatever place you turn to, they are against us,
so that you have need to be upon your guard on all sides," Note, God has
many ways of bringing to light, and so bringing to nought, the devices
and designs of his and his church's enemies. Even the cold and feeble
Jews that contentedly dwell by them shall be made to serve as spies upon
them; nay, rather than fail, a bird of the air shall carry their voice.

IV\. The pious and prudent methods which Nehemiah, hereupon, took to
baffle the design, and to secure his work and workmen.

1\. It is said ([Neh 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#014).md) he looked.
(1.) He looked up, engaged God for him, and put himself and his cause
under the divine protection ([Neh
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#009).md): We made our prayer unto our God.
That was the way of this good man, and should be our way; all his cares,
all his griefs, all his fears, he spread before God, and thereby made
himself easy. This was the first thing he did; before he used any means,
he made his prayer to God, for with him we must always begin. (2.) He
looked about him. Having prayed, he set a watch against them. The
instructions Christ has given us in our spiritual warfare agree with
this example, [Mat 26:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#041.md). Watch and
pray. If we think to secure ourselves by prayer only, without
watchfulness, we are slothful and tempt God; if by watchfulness, without
prayer, we are proud and slight God; and, either way, we forfeit his
protection.

2\. Observe, (1.) How he posted the guards, [Neh
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#013.md). In the lower places he set them
behind the wall, that they might annoy the enemy over it, as a
breast-work; but in the higher places, where the wall was raised to its
full height, he set them upon it, that from the top of it they might
throw down stones or darts upon the heads of the assailants: he set them
after their families, that mutual relation might engage them to mutual
assistance. (2.) How he animated and encouraged the people, [Neh
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#014.md). He observed even the nobles and
rulers themselves, as well as the rest of the people, to be in a great
consternation upon the intelligence that was brought them, and ready to
conclude that they were all undone, by which their hands were weakened
both for work and war, and therefore, he endeavours to silence their
fears. "Come," says he, "be not afraid of them, but behave yourselves
valiantly, considering, \[1.\] Whom you fight under. You cannot have a
better captain: Remember the Lord, who is great and terrible; you think
your enemies great and terrible, but what are they in comparison with
God, especially in opposition to him? He is great above them to control
them, and will be terrible to them when he comes to reckon with them."
Those that with an eye of faith see the church's God to be great and
terrible will see the church's enemies to be mean and despicable. The
reigning fear of God is the best antidote against the ensnaring fear of
man. He that is afraid of a man that shall die forgets the Lord his
Maker, [Isa 51:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#012.md), [Isa
51:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#013.md). \[2.\] "Whom you fight for. You
cannot have a better cause; you fight for your brethren ([Psa
122:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#008).md), your sons, and your daughters.
All that is dear to you in their world lies at stake; therefore behave
yourselves valiantly."

V. The happy disappointment which this gave to the enemies, [Neh
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#015.md). When they found that their
design was discovered, and that the Jews were upon their guard, they
concluded that it was to no purpose to attempt any thing, but that God
had brought their counsel to nought. They knew they could not gain their
point but by surprise, and, if their plot was known, it was quashed. The
Jews hereupon returned every one to his work, with so much the more
cheerfulness because they saw plainly that God owned it and owned them
in the doing of it. Note, God's care of our safety should engage and
encourage us to go on with vigour in our duty. As soon as ever a danger
is over let us return to our work, and trust God another time.

[Nehemiah 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">neh 4:16</span></span>

When the builders had so far reason to think the design of the enemies
broken as to return to their work, yet they were not so secure as to lay
down their arms, knowing how restless and unwearied they were in their
attempts, and that, if one design failed, they would be hatching
another. Thus must we watch always against our spiritual enemies, and
not expect that our warfare will be accomplished till our work is. See
what course Nehemiah took, that the people might hold themselves in a
readiness, in case there should be an attack. 1. While one half were at
work, the other half were under their arms, holding spears, and shields,
and bows, not only for themselves but for the labourers too, who would
immediately quit their work, and betake themselves to their weapons,
upon the first alarm, [Neh 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#016.md). It is
probable that they changed services at stated hours, which would relieve
the fatigue of both, and particularly would be an ease to the bearers of
burdens, whose strength had decayed ([Neh
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#010).md); while they held the weapons,
they were eased and yet not idle. Thus dividing their time between the
trowels and the spears, they are said to work with one hand and hold
their weapons with the other ([Neh
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#017).md), which cannot be understood
literally, for the work would require both hands; but it intimates that
they were equally employed in both. Thus must we work out our salvation
with the weapons of our warfare in our hand; for in every duty we must
expect to meet with opposition from our spiritual enemies, against whom
we must still be fighting the good fight of faith. 2. Every builder had
a sword by his side ([Neh 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#018).md), which
he could carry without hindering his labour. The word of God is the
sword of the Spirit, which we ought to have always at hand and never to
seek, both in our labours and in our conflicts as Christians. 3. Care
was taken both to get and give early notice of the approach of the
enemy, in case they should endeavour to surprise them. Nehemiah kept a
trumpeter always by him to sound an alarm, upon the first intimation of
danger. The work was large, and the builders were dispersed; for in all
parts of the wall they were labouring at the same time. Nehemiah
continually walked round to oversee the work and encourage the workmen,
and so would have speedy intelligence if the enemy made an attack, of
which, by sound of trumpet, he would soon give notice to all, and they
must immediately repair to him with a full assurance that their God
would fight for them, [Neh 4:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#018.md).
When they acted as workmen, it was requisite they should be dispersed
wherever there was work to do; but when as soldiers it was requisite
they should come into close order, and be found in a body. Thus should
the labourers in Christ's building be ready to unite against a common
foe. 4. The inhabitants of the villages were ordered to lodge within
Jerusalem, with their servants, not only that they might be the nearer
to their work in the morning, but that they might be ready to help in
case of an attack in the night, [Neh
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#022.md). The strength of a city lies more
in its hands than in its walls; secure them, and God's blessing upon
them, and be secure. 5. Nehemiah himself, and all his men, kept closely
to their business. The spears were held up, with the sight of them to
terrify the enemy, not only from sun to sun, but from twilight to
twilight every day, [Neh 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#021.md). Thus
ought we to be always upon our guard against our spiritual enemies, not
only (as here) while it is light, but when it is dark, for they are the
rulers of the darkness of this world. Nay, so very intent was Nehemiah
upon his work, and so fast did he hold his servants to it, that while
the heat of the business lasted neither he himself nor his attendants
went into bed, but every night lay and slept in their clothes ([Neh
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#023).md), except that they shifted them
now and then, either for cleanliness or in a case of ceremonial
pollution. It was a sign that their heart was upon their work when they
could not find time to dress and undress, but resolved they would be at
all times ready for service. Good work is likely to go on successfully
when those that labour in it thus make a business of it.
