### [Romans Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#001.md)

[Romans](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rom 3:0</span></span>

The apostle, in this chapter, carries on his discourse concerning
justification. He had already proved the guilt both of Gentiles and
Jews. Now in this chapter, I. He answers some objections that might be
made against what he had said about the Jews ([Rom
3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#001).md). II. He asserts the guilt and
corruption of mankind in common, both Jews and Gentiles ([Rom
3:9-18](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#009).md). III. He argues thence that
justification must needs be by faith, and not by the law, which he gives
several reasons for ([Rom 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019.md) to the
end). The many digressions in his writings render his discourse
sometimes a little difficult, but his scope is evident.

[Romans 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 3:1</span></span>

I. Here the apostle answers several objections, which might be made, to
clear his way. No truth so plain and evident but wicked wits and corrupt
carnal hearts will have something to say against it; but divine truths
must be cleared from cavil.

Object. 1. If Jew and Gentile stand so much upon the same level before
God, what advantage then hath the Jew? Hath not God often spoken with a
great deal of respect for the Jews, as a non-such people ([Deu
33:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029).md), a holy nation, a peculiar
treasure, the seed of Abraham his friend: Did not he institute
circumcision as a badge of their church-membership, and a seal of their
covenant-relation to God? Now does not this levelling doctrine deny them
all such prerogatives, and reflect dishonour upon the ordinance of
circumcision, as a fruitless insignificant thing.

Answer. The Jews are, notwithstanding this, a people greatly privileged
and honoured, have great means and helps, though these be not infallibly
saving ([Rom 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#002).md): Much every way. The
door is open to the Gentiles as well as the Jews, but the Jews have a
fairer way up to this door, by reason of their church-privileges, which
are not to be undervalued, though many that have them perish eternally
for not improving them. He reckons up many of the Jews' privileges [Rom
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md), [Rom
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005.md); here he mentions but one (which
is indeed instar omnium - equivalent to all), that unto them were
committed the oracles of God, that is, the scriptures of the Old
Testament, especially the law of Moses, which is called the lively
oracles ([Act 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038).md), and those types,
promises, and prophecies, which relate to Christ and the gospel. The
scriptures are the oracles of God: they are a divine revelation, they
come from heaven, are of infallible truth, and of eternal consequence as
oracles. The Septuagint call the Urim and Thummim the logia - the
oracles. The scripture is our breast-plate of judgment. We must have
recourse to the law and to the testimony, as to an oracle. The gospel is
called the oracles of God, [Heb 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012.md);
[Pe1 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#011.md). Now these oracles were
committed to the Jews; the Old Testament was written in their language;
Moses and the prophets were of their nation, lived among them, preached
and wrote primarily to and for the Jews. They were committed to them as
trustees for succeeding ages and churches. The Old Testament was
deposited in their hands, to be carefully preserved pure and uncorrupt,
and so transmitted down to posterity. The Jews were the Christians'
library-keepers, were entrusted with that sacred treasure for their own
use and benefit in the first place, and then for the advantage of the
world; and, in preserving the letter of the scripture, they were very
faithful to their trust, did not lose one iota or tittle, in which we
are to acknowledge God's gracious care and providence. The Jews had the
means of salvation, but they had not the monopoly of salvation. Now this
he mentions with a chiefly, prōton men gar - this was their prime and
principal privilege. The enjoyment of God's word and ordinances is the
chief happiness of a people, is to be put in the imprimis of their
advantages, [Deu 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#008.md); [Deu
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#003.md); [Psa
147:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#020.md).

Object. 2. Against what he had said of the advantages the Jews had in
the lively oracles, some might object the unbelief of many of them. To
what purpose were the oracles of God committed to them, when so many of
them, notwithstanding these oracles, continued strangers to Christ, and
enemies to his gospel? Some did not believe, [Rom
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003.md).

Answer. It is very true that some, nay most of the present Jews, do not
believe in Christ; but shall their unbelief make the faith of God
without effect? The apostle startles at such a thought: God forbid! The
infidelity and obstinacy of the Jews could not invalidate and overthrow
those prophecies of the Messiah which were contained in the oracles
committed to them. Christ will be glorious, though Israel be not
gathered, [Isa 49:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#005.md). God's words shall
be accomplished, his purposes performed, and all his ends answered,
though there be a generation that by their unbelief go about to make God
a liar. Let God be true but every man a liar; let us abide by this
principle, that God is true to every word which he has spoken, and will
let none of his oracles fall to the ground, though thereby we give the
lie to man; better question and overthrow the credit of all the men in
the world than doubt of the faithfulness of God. What David said in his
haste ([Psa 116:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#011).md), that all men are
liars, Paul here asserts deliberately. Lying is a limb of that old man
which we every one of us come into the world clothed with. All men are
fickle, and mutable, and given to change, vanity and a lie ([Psa
62:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#009).md), altogether vanity, [Psa
39:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#005.md). All men are liars, compared with
God. It is very comfortable, when we find every man a liar (no faith in
man), that God is faithful. When they speak vanity every one with his
neighbour, it is very comfortable to think that the words of the Lord
are pure words, [Psa 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#002.md), [Psa
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#006.md). For the further proof of this he
quotes [Psa 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004.md), That thou mightest
be justified, the design of which is to show, 1. That God does and will
preserve his own honour in the world, notwithstanding the sins of men.
2. That it is our duty, in all our conclusions concerning ourselves and
others, to justify God and to assert and maintain his justice, truth,
and goodness, however it goes. David lays a load upon himself in his
confession, that he might justify God, and acquit him from any
injustice. So here, Let the credit or reputation of man shift for
itself, the matter is not great whether it sink or swim; let us hold
fast this conclusion, how specious soever the premises may be to the
contrary, that the Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all
his works. Thus is God justified in his sayings, and cleared when he
judges (as it is [Psa 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004).md), or when
he is judged, as it is here rendered. When men presume to quarrel with
God and his proceedings, we may be sure the sentence will go on God's
side.

Object. 3. Carnal hearts might hence take occasion to encourage
themselves in sin. He had said that the universal guilt and corruption
of mankind gave occasion to the manifestation of God's righteousness in
Jesus Christ. Now it may be suggested, If all our sin be so far from
overthrowing God's honour that it commends it, and his ends are secured,
so that there is no harm done, is it not unjust for God to punish our
sin and unbelief so severely? If the unrighteousness of the Jews gave
occasion to the calling in of the Gentiles, and so to God's greater
glory, why are the Jews so much censured? If our unrighteousness commend
the righteousness of God, what shall we say? [Rom
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005.md). What inference may be drawn from
this? Is God unrighteous, mē adikos ho Theos - Is not God unrighteous
(so it may be read, more in the form of an objection), who taketh
vengeance? Unbelieving hearts will gladly take any occasion to quarrel
with equity of God's proceedings, and to condemn him that is most just,
[Job 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#017.md). I speak as a man, that is,
I object this as the of carnal hearts; it is suggested like a man, a
vain, foolish, proud creature.

Answer. God forbid; far be it from us to imagine such a thing.
Suggestions that reflect dishonour upon God and his justice and holiness
are rather to be startled at than parleyed with. Get thee behind me,
Satan; never entertain such a thought. For then how shall God judge the
world? [Rom 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#006.md). The argument is much
the same with that of Abraham ([Gen
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#025).md): Shall not the Judge of all the
earth do right? No doubt, he shall. If he were not infinitely just and
righteous, he would be unfit to be the judge of all the earth. Shall
even he that hateth right govern? [Job
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#017.md). Compare [Job
34:18](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#018.md), [Job
34:19](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#019.md). The sin has never the less of
malignity and demerit in it though God bring glory to himself out of it.
It is only accidentally that sin commends God's righteousness. No thanks
to the sinner for that, who intends no such thing. The consideration of
God's judging the world should for ever silence all our doubtings of,
and reflections upon, his justice and equity. It is not for us to
arraign the proceedings of such an absolute Sovereign. The sentence of
the supreme court, whence lies no appeal, is not to be called in
question.

Object. 4. The former objection is repeated and prosecuted ([Rom
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#007.md), [Rom
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#008).md), for proud hearts will hardly be
beaten out of their refuge of lies, but will hold fast the deceit. But
his setting off the objection in its own colours is sufficient to answer
it: If the truth of God has more abounded through my lie. He supposes
the sophisters to follow their objection thus: "If my lie, that is, my
sin" (for there is something of a lie in every sin, especially in the
sins of professors) "have occasioned the glorifying of God's truth and
faithfulness, why should I be judged and condemned as a sinner, and not
rather thence take encouragement to go on in my sin, that grace may
abound?" an inference which at first sight appears too black to be
argued, and fit to be cast out with abhorrence. Daring sinners take
occasion to boast in mischief, because the goodness of God endures
continually, [Psa 52:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001.md). Let us do evil
that good may come is oftener in the heart than in the mouth of sinners,
so justifying themselves in their wicked ways. Mentioning this wicked
thought, he observes, in a parenthesis, that there were those who
charged such doctrines as this upon Paul and his fellow-ministers: Some
affirm that we say so. It is no new thing for the best of God's people
and ministers to be charged with holding and teaching such things as
they do most detest and abhor; and it is not to be thought strange, when
our Master himself was said to be in league with Beelzebub. Many have
been reproached as if they had said that the contrary of which they
maintain: it is an old artifice of Satan thus to cast dirt upon Christ's
ministers, Fortiter calumniari, aliquid adhaerebit - Lay slander thickly
on, for some will be sure to stick. The best men and the best truths are
subject to slander. Bishop Sanderson makes a further remark upon this,
as we are slanderously reported - blasphēmoumetha. Blasphemy in
scripture usually signifies the highest degree of slander, speaking ill
of God. The slander of a minister and his regular doctrine is a more
than ordinary slander, it is a kind of blasphemy, not for his person's
sake, but for his calling's sake and his work's sake, [Th1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#013.md).

Answer. He says no more by way of confutation but that, whatever they
themselves may argue, the damnation of those is just. Some understand it
of the slanderers; God will justly condemn those who unjustly condemn
his truth. Or, rather, it is to be applied to those who embolden
themselves in sin under a pretence of God's getting glory to himself out
of it. Those who deliberately do evil that good may come of it will be
so far from escaping, under the shelter of that excuse, that it will
rather justify their damnation, and render them the more inexcusable;
for sinning upon such a surmise, and in such a confidence, argues a
great deal both of the wit and of the will in the sin - a wicked will
deliberately to choose the evil, and a wicked wit to palliate it with
the pretence of good arising from it. Therefore their damnation is just;
and, whatever excuses of this kind they may now please themselves with,
they will none of them stand good in the great day, but God will be
justified in his proceedings, and all flesh, even the proud flesh that
now lifts up itself against him, shall be silent before him. Some think
Paul herein refers to the approaching ruin of the Jewish church and
nation, which their obstinacy and self-justification in their unbelief
hastened upon them apace.

II\. Paul, having removed these objections, next revives his assertion
of the general guilt and corruption of mankind in common, both of Jews
and Gentiles, [Rom 3:9-18](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#009.md). "Are we
better than they, we Jews, to whom were committed the oracles of God?
Does this recommend us to God, or will this justify us? No, by no
means." Or, "Are we Christians (Jews and Gentiles) so much better
antecedently than the unbelieving part as to have merited God's grace?
Alas! no: before free grace made the difference, those of us that had
been Jews and those that had been Gentiles were all alike corrupted."
They are all under sin. Under the guilt of sin: under it as under a
sentence; - under it as under a bond, by which they are bound over to
eternal ruin and damnation; - under it as under a burden ([Psa
38:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#004).md) that will sink them to the
lowest hell: we are guilty before God, [Rom
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019.md). Under the government and
dominion of sin: under it as under a tyrant and cruel task-master,
enslaved to it; - under it as under a yoke; - under the power of it,
sold to work wickedness. And this he had proved, proētiasametha. It is a
law term: We have charged them with it, and have made good our charge;
we have proved the indictment, we have convicted them by the notorious
evidence of the fact. This charge and conviction he here further
illustrates by several scriptures out of the Old Testament, which
describe the corrupt depraved state of all men, till grave restrain or
change them; so that herein as in a glass we may all of us behold our
natural face. The [Rom 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#010.md), [Rom
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#011.md), and [Rom
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#012.md) verses are taken from [Psa
14:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md), which are repeated as
containing a very weighty truth, [Psa
53:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001.md). The rest that follows here is
found in the Septuagint translation of the 14th Psalm, which some think
the apostle chooses to follow as better known; but I rather think that
Paul took these passages from other places of scripture here referred
to, but in later copies of the Septuagint they were all added in [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md) from this discourse of Paul. It
is observable that, to prove the general corruption of nature, he quotes
some scriptures which speak of the particular corruptions of particular
persons, as of Doeg ([Psa 140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003).md), of
the Jews ([Isa 59:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007.md), [Isa
59:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#008).md), which shows that the same sins
that are committed by one are in the nature of all. The times of David
and Isaiah were some of the better times, and yet to their days he
refers. What is said [Psa 14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md) is
expressly spoken of all the children of men, and that upon a particular
view and inspection made by God himself. The Lord looked down, as upon
the old world, [Gen 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#005.md). And this
judgment of God was according to truth. He who, when he himself had made
all, looked upon every thing that he had made, and behold all was very
good, now that man had marred all, looked, and behold all was very bad.
Let us take a view of the particulars. Observe,

1\. That which is habitual, which is two-fold: -

(1.) An habitual defect of every thing that is good. \[1.\] There is
none righteous, none that has an honest good principle of virtue, or is
governed by such a principle, none that retains any thing of that image
of God, consisting in righteousness, wherein man was created; no, not
one; implying that, if there had been but one, God would have found him
out. When all the world was corrupt, God had his eye upon one righteous
Noah. Even those who through grace are justified and sanctified were
none of them righteous by nature. No righteousness is born with us. The
man after God's own heart owns himself conceived in sin. \[2.\] There is
none that understandeth, [Rom 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#011.md).
The fault lies in the corruption of the understanding; that is blinded,
depraved, perverted. Religion and righteousness have so much reason on
their side that if people had but any understanding they would be better
and do better. But they do not understand. Sinners are fools. \[3.\]
None that seeketh after God, that is, none that has any regard to God,
any desire after him. Those may justly be reckoned to have no
understanding that do not seek after God. The carnal mind is so far from
seeking after God that really it is enmity against him. \[4.\] They are
together become unprofitable, [Rom
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#012.md). Those that have forsaken God
soon grow good for nothing, useless burdens of the earth. Those that are
in a state of sin are the most unprofitable creatures under the sun; for
it follows, \[5.\] There is none that doeth good; no, not a just man
upon the earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not, [Ecc
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#023.md). Even in those actions of sinners
that have some goodness in them there is a fundamental error in the
principle and end; so that it may be said, There is none that doeth
good. Malum oritur ex quolibet defectu - Every defect is the source of
evil.

(2.) An habitual defection to every thing that is evil: They are all
gone out of the way. No wonder that those miss the right way who do not
seek after God, the highest end. God made man in the way, set him in
right, but he hath forsaken it. The corruption of mankind is an
apostasy.

2\. That which is actual. And what good can be expected from such a
degenerate race? He instances,

(1.) In their words ([Rom 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#013.md), [Rom
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#014).md), in three things particularly: -
\[1.\] Cruelty: Their throat is an open sepulchre, ready to swallow up
the poor and innocent, waiting an opportunity to do mischief, like the
old serpent seeking to devour, whose name is Abaddon and Apollyon, the
destroyer. And when they do not openly avow this cruelty, and vent it
publicly, yet they are underhand intending mischief: the poison of asps
is under their lips ([Jam 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#008).md), the
most venomous and incurable poison, with which they blast the good name
of their neighbour by reproaches, and aim at his life by false witness.
These passages are borrowed from [Psa
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#009.md) and [Psa
140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003.md). \[2.\] Cheating: With their
tongues they have used deceit. Herein they show themselves the devil's
children, for he is a liar, and the father of lies. They have used it:
it intimates that they make a trade of lying; it is their constant
practice, especially belying the ways and people of God. \[3.\] Cursing:
reflecting upon God, and blaspheming his holy name; wishing evil to
their brethren: Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. This is
mentioned as one of the great sins of the tongue, [Jam
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#009.md). But those that thus love cursing
shall have enough of it, [Psa
109:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#017.md). How many, who are called
Christians, do by these sin evince that they are still under the reign
and dominion of sin, still in the condition that they were born in.

(2.) In their ways ([Rom 3:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#015).md):
Their feet are swift to shed blood; that is, they are very industrious
to compass any cruel design, ready to lay hold of all such
opportunities. Wherever they go, destruction and misery go along with
them; these are their companions-destruction and misery to the people of
God, to the country and neighbourhood where they live, to the land and
nation, and to themselves at last. Besides the destruction and misery
that are at the end of their ways (death is the end of these things),
destruction and misery are in their ways; their sin is its own
punishment: a man needs no more to make him miserable than to be a slave
to his sins. - And the way of peace have they not known; that is, they
know not how to preserve peace with others, nor how to obtain peace for
themselves. They may talk of peace, such a peace as is in the devil's
palace, while he keeps it, but they are strangers to all true peace;
they know not the things that belong to their peace. These are quoted
from [Pro 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#016.md); [Isa
59:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007.md), [Isa
59:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#008.md).

(3.) The root of all this we have: There is no fear of God before their
eyes, [Rom 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#018.md). The fear of God is
here put for all practical religion, which consists in an awful and
serious regard to the word and will of God as our rule, to the honour
and glory of God as our end. Wicked people have not this before their
eyes; that is, they do not steer by it; they are governed by other
rules, aim at other ends. This is quoted from [Psa
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001.md). Where no fear of God is, no good
is to be expected. The fear of God is would lay a restraint upon our
spirits, and keep them right, [Neh
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#015.md). When once fear is cast off,
prayer is restrained ([Job 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#004).md), and
then all goes to wreck and ruin quickly. So that we have here a short
account of the general depravity and corruption of mankind; and may say,
O Adam! what hast thou done? God made man upright, but thus he hath
sought out many inventions.

[Romans 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 3:19</span></span>

From all this Paul infers that it is in vain to look for justification
by the works of the law, and that it is to be had only by faith, which
is the point he has been all along proving, from [Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md), and which he lays down ([Rom
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#028).md) as the summary of his discourse,
with a quod erat demonstrandum - which was to be demonstrated. We
conclude that a man is justified by faith, without the deeds of the law;
not by the deeds of the first law of pure innocence, which left no room
for repentance, nor the deeds of the law of nature, how highly soever
improved, nor the deeds of the ceremonial law (the blood of bulls and
goats could not take away sin), nor the deeds of the moral law, which
are certainly included, for he speaks of that law by which is the
knowledge of sin and those works which might be matter of boasting. Man,
in his depraved state, under the power of such corruption, could never,
by any works of his own, gain acceptance with God; but it must be
resolved purely into the free grace of God, given through Jesus Christ
to all true believers that receive it as a free gift. If we had never
sinned, our obedience to the law would have been our righteousness: "Do
this, and live." But having sinned, and being corrupted, nothing that we
can do will atone for our former guilt. It was by their obedience to the
moral law that the Pharisees looked for justification, [Luk
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#011.md). Now there are two things from
which the apostle here argues: the guiltiness of man, to prove that we
cannot be justified by the works of the law, and the glory of God, to
prove that we must be justified by faith.

I. He argues from man's guiltiness, to show the folly of expecting
justification by the works of the law. The argument is very plain: we
can never be justified and saved by the law that we have broken. A
convicted traitor can never come off by pleading the statute of 25
Edward III, for that law discovers his crime and condemns him: indeed,
if he had never broken it, he might have been justified by it; but now
it is past that he has broken it, and there is no way of coming off but
by pleading the act of indemnity, upon which he has surrendered and
submitted himself, and humbly and penitently claiming the benefit of it
and casting himself upon it. Now concerning the guiltiness of man,

1\. He fastens it particularly upon the Jews; for they were the men that
made their boast of the law, and set up for justification by it. He had
quoted several scriptures out of the Old Testament to show this
corruption: Now, says he ([Rom 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019).md),
this that the law says, it says to those who are under the law; this
conviction belongs to the Jews as well as others, for it is written in
their law. The Jews boasted of their being under the law, and placed a
great deal of confidence in it: "But," says he, "the law convicts and
condemns you - you see it does." That every mouth may be stopped - that
all boasting may be silenced. See the method that God takes both in
justifying and condemning: he stops every mouth; those that are
justified have their mouths stopped by a humble conviction; those that
are condemned have their mouths stopped too, for they shall at last be
convinced ([Jde 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#015).md), and sent
speechless to hell, [Mat 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#012.md). All
iniquity shall stop her mouth, [Psa
107:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#042.md).

2\. He extends it in general to all the world: That all the world may
become guilty before God. If the world likes in wickedness ([Jo1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019).md), to be sure it is guilty. - May
become guilty; that is, may be proved guilty, liable to punishment, all
by nature children of wrath, [Eph 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003.md).
They must all plead guilty; those that stand most upon their own
justification will certainly be cast. Guilty before God is a dreadful
word, before an all-seeing God, that is not, nor can be, deceived in his
judgment - before a just and righteous judge, who will by no means clear
the guilty. All are guilty, and therefore all have need of a
righteousness wherein to appear before God. For all have sinned ([Rom
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023).md); all are sinners by nature, by
practice, and have come short of the glory of God - have failed of that
which is the chief end of man. Come short, as the archer comes short of
the mark, as the runner comes short of the prize; so come short, as not
only not to win, but to be great losers. Come short of the glory of God.
(1.) Come short of glorifying God. See [Rom
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021.md), They glorified him not as God.
Man was placed at the head of the visible creation, actively to glorify
that great Creator whom the inferior creatures could glorify only
objectively; but man by sin comes short of this, and, instead of
glorifying God, dishonours him. It is a very melancholy consideration,
to look upon the children of men, who were made to glorify God, and to
think how few there are that do it. (2.) Come short of glorying before
God. There is no boasting of innocency: if we go about to glory before
God, to boast of any thing we are, or have, or do, this will be an
everlasting estoppe - hat we have all sinned, and this will silence us.
We may glory before men, who are short-sighted, and cannot search our
hearts, - who are corrupt, as we are, and well enough pleased with sin;
but there is no glorying before God, who cannot endure to look upon
iniquity. (3.) Come short of being glorified by God. Come short of
justification, or acceptance with God, which is glory begun - come short
of the holiness or sanctification which is the glorious image of God
upon man, and have overthrown all hopes and expectations of being
glorified with God in heaven by any righteousness of their own. It is
impossible now to get to heaven in the way of spotless innocency. That
passage is blocked up. There is a cherub and a flaming sword set to keep
that way to the tree of life.

3\. Further to drive us off from expecting justification by the law, he
ascribes this conviction to the law ([Rom
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020).md): For by the law is the knowledge
of sin. That law which convicts and condemns us can never justify us.
The law is the straight rule, that rectum which is index sui et obliqui
- that which points out the right and the wrong; it is the proper use
and intendment of the law to open our wound, and therefore not likely to
be the remedy. That which is searching is not sanative. Those that would
know sin must get the knowledge of the law in its strictness, extent,
and spiritual nature. If we compare our own hearts and lives with the
rule, we shall discover wherein we have turned aside. Paul makes this
use of the law, [Rom 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#009.md), Therefore by
the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight. Observe,
(1.) No flesh shall be justified, no man, no corrupted man ([Gen
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003).md), for that he also is flesh,
sinful and depraved; therefore not justified, because we are flesh. The
corruption that remains in our nature will for ever obstruct any
justification by our own works, which, coming from flesh, must needs
taste of the cask, [Job 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#004). (2..md) Not
justified in his sight. He does not deny that justification which was by
the deeds of the law in the sight of the church: they were, in their
church-estate, as embodied in a polity, a holy people, a nation of
priests; but as the conscience stands in relation to God, in his sight,
we cannot be justified by the deeds of the law. The apostle refers to
[Psa 143:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#002.md).

II\. He argues from God's glory to prove that justification must be
expected only by faith in Christ's righteousness. There is no
justification by the works of the law. Must guilty man then remain
eternally under wrath? Is there no hope? Is the wound become incurable
because of transgression? No, blessed be God, it is not ([Rom
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021.md), [Rom
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022).md); there is another way laid open
for us, the righteousness of God without the law is manifested now under
the gospel. Justification may be obtained without the keeping of Moses's
law: and this is called the righteousness of God, righteousness of his
ordaining, and providing, and accepting, - righteousness which he
confers upon us; as the Christian armour is called the armour of God,
[Eph 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#011.md).

1\. Now concerning this righteousness of God observe, (1.) That it is
manifested. The gospel-way of justification is a high-way, a plain way,
it is laid open for us: the brazen serpent is lifted up upon the pole;
we are not left to grope our way in the dark, but it is manifested to
us. (2.) It is without the law. Here he obviates the method of the
judaizing Christians, who would needs join Christ and Moses together -
owning Christ for the Messiah, and yet too fondly retaining the law,
keeping up the ceremonies of it, and imposing it upon the Gentile
converts: no, says he, it is without the law. The righteousness that
Christ hath brought in is a complete righteousness. (3.) Yet it is
witnessed by the law and the prophets; that is, there were types, and
prophecies, and promises, in the Old Testament, that pointed at this.
The law is so far from justifying us that it directs us to another way
of justification, points at Christ as our righteousness, to whom bear
all the prophets witness. See [Act
10:43](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#043.md). This might recommend it to the
Jews, who were so fond of the law and the prophets. (4.) It is by the
faith of Jesus Christ, that faith which hath Jesus Christ for its object
- an anointed Saviour, so Jesus Christ signifies. Justifying faith
respects Christ as a Saviour in all his three anointed offices, as
prophet, priest, and king-trusting in him, accepting of him, and
adhering to him, in all these. It is by this that we become interested
in that righteousness which God has ordained, and which Christ has
brought in. (5.) It is to all, and upon all, those that believe. In this
expression he inculcates that which he had been often harping upon, that
Jews and Gentiles, if they believe, stand upon the same level, and are
alike welcome to God through Christ; for there is no difference. Or, it
is eis pantas - to all, offered all in general; the gospel excludes none
that do not exclude themselves; but it is to epi pantas tous piseuonta,
upon all that believe, not only tendered to them, but put upon them as a
crown, as a robe; they are, upon their believing, interested in it, and
entitled to all the benefits and privileges of it.

2\. But now how is this for God's glory?

(1.) It is for the glory of his grace ([Rom
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024).md): Justified freely by his grace -
dōrean tē chariti. It is by his grace, not by the grace wrought in us as
the papists say, confounding justification and sanctification, but by
the gracious favour of God to us, without any merit in us so much as
foreseen. And, to make it the more emphatic, he says it is freely by his
grace, to show that it must be understood of grace in the most proper
and genuine sense. It is said that Joseph found grace in the sight of
his master ([Gen 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#004).md), but there was
a reason; he saw that what he did prospered. There was something in
Joseph to invite that grace; but the grace of God communicated to us
comes freely, freely; it is free grace, mere mercy; nothing in us to
deserve such favours: no, it is all through the redemption that is in
Jesus Christ. It comes freely to us, but Christ bought it, and paid
dearly for it, which yet is so ordered as not to derogate from the
honour of free grace. Christ's purchase is no bar to the freeness of
God's grace; for grace provided and accepted this vicarious
satisfaction.

(2.) It is for the glory of his justice and righteousness ([Rom
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md), [Rom
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026).md): Whom God hath set forth to be a
propitiation, etc. Note, \[1.\] Jesus Christ is the great propitiation,
or propitiatory sacrifice, typified by the hilastērion, or mercy-seat,
under the law. He is our throne of grace, in and through whom atonement
is made for sin, and our persons and performances are accepted of God,
[Jo1 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002.md). He is all in all in our
reconciliation, not only the maker, but the matter of it - our priest,
our sacrifice, our altar, our all. God was in Christ as in his
mercy-seat, reconciling the world unto himself. \[2.\] God hath set him
forth to be so. God, the party offended, makes the first overtures
towards a reconciliation, appoints the days-man; proetheto -
fore-ordained him to this, in the counsels of his love from eternity,
appointed, anointed him to it, qualified him for it, and has exhibited
him to a guilty world as their propitiation. See [Mat
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017.md), and [Mat
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#005.md). \[3.\] That by faith in his
blood we become interested in this propitiation. Christ is the
propitiation; there is the healing plaster provided. Faith is the
applying of this plaster to the wounded soul. And this faith in the
business of justification hath a special regard to the blood of Christ,
as that which made the atonement; for such was the divine appointment
that without blood there should be no remission, and no blood but his
would do it effectually. Here may be an allusion to the sprinkling of
the blood of the sacrifices under the law, as [Exo
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#008.md). Faith is the bunch of hyssop,
and the blood of Christ is the blood of sprinkling. \[4.\] That all who
by faith are interested in this propitiation have the remission of their
sins that are past. It was for this that Christ was set forth to be a
propitiation, in order to remission, to which the reprieves of his
patience and forbearance were a very encouraging preface. Through the
forbearance of God. Divine patience has kept us out of hell, that we
might have space to repent, and get to heaven. Some refer the sins that
are past to the sins of the Old Testament saints, which were pardoned
for the sake of the atonement which Christ in the fulness of time was to
make, which looked backward as well as forward. Past through the
forbearance of God. It is owing to the divine forbearance that we were
not taken in the very act of sin. Several Greek copies make en tēanochē
tou Theou - through the forbearance of God, to begin [Rom
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026.md), and they denote two precious
fruits of Christ's merit and God's grace: - Remission: dia tēn paresin -
for the remission; and reprieves: the forbearance of God. It is owing to
the master's goodness and the dresser's mediation that barren trees are
let alone in the vineyard; and in both God's righteousness is declared,
in that without a mediator and a propitiation he would not only not
pardon, but not so much as forbear, not spare a moment; it is owning to
Christ that there is ever a sinner on this side hell. \[5.\] That God
does in all this declare his righteousness. This he insists upon with a
great deal of emphasis: To declare, I say, at this time his
righteousness. It is repeated, as that which has in it something
surprising. He declares his righteousness, First, In the propitiation
itself. Never was there such a demonstration of the justice and holiness
of God as there was in the death of Christ. It appears that he hates
sin, when nothing less than the blood of Christ would satisfy for it.
Finding sin, though but imputed, upon his own Son, he did not spare him,
because he had made himself sin for us, [Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021.md). The iniquities of us all being
laid upon him, though he was the Son of his love, yet it pleased the
Lord to bruise him, [Isa 53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md).
Secondly, In the pardon upon that propitiation; so it follows, by way of
explication: That he might be just, and the justifier of him that
believeth. Mercy and truth are so met together, righteousness and peace
have so kissed each other, that it is now become not only an act of
grace and mercy, but an act of righteousness, in God, to pardon the sins
of penitent believers, having accepted the satisfaction that Christ by
dying made to his justice for them. It would not comport with his
justice to demand the debt of the principal when the surety has paid it
and he has accepted that payment in full satisfaction. See [Jo1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009.md). He is just, that is, faithful to
his word.

(3.) It is for God's glory; for boasting is thus excluded, [Rom
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#027.md). God will have the great work of
the justification and salvation of sinners carried on from first to last
in such a way as to exclude boasting, that no flesh may glory in his
presence, [Co1 1:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#029.md). Now, if
justification were by the works of the law, boasting would not be
excluded. How should it? If we were saved by our own works, we might put
the crown upon our own heads. But the law of faith, that is, the way of
justification by faith, doth for ever exclude boasting; for faith is a
depending, self-emptying, self-denying grace, and casts every crown
before the throne; therefore it is most for God's glory that thus we
should be justified. Observe, He speaks of the law of faith. Believers
are not left lawless: faith is a law, it is a working grace, wherever it
is in truth; and yet, because it acts in a strict and close dependence
upon Jesus Christ, it excludes boasting.

From all this he draws this conclusion ([Rom
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#028).md): That a man is justified by
faith without the deeds of the law.

III\. In the close of the chapter he shows the extent of this privilege
of justification by faith, and that it is not the peculiar privilege of
the Jews, but pertains to the Gentiles also; for he had said ([Rom
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022).md) that there is no difference: and
as to this, 1. He asserts and proves it ([Rom
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#029).md): Is he the God of the Jews only?
He argues from the absurdity of such a supposition. Can it be imagined
that a God of infinite love and mercy should limit and confine his
favours to that little perverse people of the Jews, leaving all the rest
of the children of men in a condition eternally desperate? This would by
no means agree with the idea we have of the divine goodness, for his
tender mercies are over all his works; therefore it is one God of grace
that justifies the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through
faith, that is, both in one and the same way. However the Jews, in
favour of themselves, will needs fancy a difference, really there is no
more difference than between by and through, that is, no difference at
all. 2. He obviates an objection ([Rom
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#031).md), as if this doctrine did nullify
the law, which they knew came from God: "No," says he, "though we do say
that the law will not justify us, yet we do not therefore say that it
was given in vain, or is of no use to us; no, we establish the right use
of the law, and secure its standing, by fixing it on the right basis.
The law is still of use to convince us of what is past, and to direct us
for the future; though we cannot be saved by it as a covenant, yet we
own it, and submit to it, as a rule in the hand of the Mediator,
subordinate to the law of grace; and so are so far from overthrowing
that we establish the law." Let those consider this who deny the
obligation of the moral law on believers.
