### [Psalms Chapter 145](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 145:0</span></span>

The five foregoing psalms were all of a piece, all full of prayers;
this, and the five that follow it to the end of the book, are all of a
piece too, all full of praises; and though only this is entitled David's
psalm yet we have no reason to think but that they were all his as well
as all the foregoing prayers. And it is observable, 1. That after five
psalms of prayer follow six psalms of praise; for those that are much in
prayer shall not want matter for praise, and those that have sped in
prayer must abound in praise. Our thanksgivings for mercy, when we have
received it, should even exceed our supplications for it when we were in
pursuit of it. David, in the last of his begging psalms, had promised to
praise God ([Psa 145:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#009).md), and here he
performs his promise. 2. That the book of Psalms concludes with psalms
of praise, all praise, for praise, is the conclusion of the whole
matter; it is that in which all the psalms centre. And it intimates that
God's people, towards the end of their life, should abound much in
praise, and the rather because, at the end of their life, they hope to
remove to the world of everlasting praise, and the nearer they come to
heaven the more they should accustom themselves to the work of heaven.
This is one of those psalms which are composed alphabetically (as Ps. 25
and Ps. 34, etc.), that it might be the more easily committed to memory,
and kept in mind. The Jewish writers justly extol this psalm as a star
of the first magnitude in this bright constellation; and some of them
have an extravagant saying concerning it, not much unlike some of the
popish superstitions, That whosoever will sing this psalm constantly
three times a day shall certainly be happy in the world to come. In this
psalm, I. David engages himself and others to praise God ([Psa
145:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#001.md), [Psa
145:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#002.md), [Psa
145:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#004.md), [Psa
145:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#010).md). II. He fastens upon those
things that are proper matter for praise, God's greatness (v . 3), his
goodness ([Psa 145:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#008.md), [Psa
145:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#009).md), the proofs of both in the
administration of his kingdom ([Psa
145:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#013).md), the kingdom of providence
([Psa 145:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#014).md), the kingdom of grace
([Psa 145:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#017).md), and then he
concludes with a resolution to continue praising God ([Psa
145:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#021).md) with which resolution our
hearts must be filled, and in which they must be fixed, in singing this
psalm.

David's psalm of praise.

[Psalms 145:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 145:1</span></span>

The entitling of this David's psalm of praise may intimate not only that
he was the penman of it, but that he took a particular pleasure in it
and sung it often; it was his companion wherever he went. In this former
part of the psalm God's glorious attributes are praised, as, in the
latter part of the psalm, his kingdom and the administration of it.
Observe,

I. Who shall be employed in giving glory to God.

1\. Whatever others do, the psalmist will himself be much in praising
God. To this good work he here excites himself, engages himself, and has
his heart much enlarged in it. What he does, that he will do, having
more and more satisfaction in it. It was his duty; it was his delight.
Observe, (1.) How he expresses the work itself: "I will extol thee, and
bless thy name ([Psa 145:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#001).md); I will
speak well of thee, as thou hast made thyself known, and will therein
express my own high thoughts of thee and endeavour to raise the like in
others." When we speak honourably of God, this is graciously interpreted
and accepted as an extolling of him. Again ([Psa
145:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#002).md): I will bless thee, I will
praise thy name; the repetition intimates the fervency of his affection
to this work, the fixedness of his purpose to abound in it, and the
frequency of his performances therein. Again ([Psa
145:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#005).md): I will speak of thy honour,
and ([Psa 145:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#006).md) I will declare thy
greatness. He would give glory to God, not only in his solemn devotions,
but in his common conversation. If the heart be full of God, out of the
abundance of that the mouth will speak with reverence, to his praise,
upon all occasions. What subject of discourse can we find more noble,
more copious, more pleasant, useful, and unexceptionable, than the glory
of God? (2.) How he expresses his resolution to persevere in it. \[1.\]
He will be constant to this work: Every day will I bless thee. Praising
God must be our daily work. No day must pass, though ever so busy a day,
though ever so sorrowful a day, without praising God. We ought to reckon
it the most needful of our daily employments, and the most delightful of
our daily comforts. God is every day blessing us, doing well for us;
there is therefore reason that we should be every day blessing him,
speaking well of him. \[2.\] He will continue in it: I will bless thee
for ever and ever, [Psa 145:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#001.md) and
again [Psa 145:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#002.md). This intimates,
First, That he resolved to continue in this work to the end of his life,
throughout his ever in this world. Secondly, That the psalms he penned
should be made use of in praising God by the church to the end of time,
[Ch2 29:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#030.md). Thirdly, That he hoped to
be praising God to all eternity in the other world. Those that make
praise their constant work on earth shall have it their everlasting
bliss in heaven.

2\. He doubts not but others also would be forward to this work. (1.)
"They shall concur in it now; they shall join with me in it: When I
declare thy greatness men shall speak of it ([Psa
145:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#006).md); they shall abundantly utter
it" ([Psa 145:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#007).md), or pour it out (as
the word is); they shall praise God with a gracious fluency, better than
the most curious oratory. David's zeal would provoke many, and it has
done so. (2.) "They shall keep it up when I am gone, in an uninterrupted
succession ([Psa 145:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#004).md): One
generation shall praise thy works to another." The generation that is
going off shall tell them to that which is rising up, shall tell what
they have seen in their days and what they have heard from their
fathers; they shall fully and particularly declare thy mighty acts ([Psa
78:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#003).md); and the generation that is
rising up shall follow the example of that which is going off: so that
the death of God's worshippers shall be no diminution of his worship,
for a new generation shall rise up in their room to carry on that good
work, more or less, to the end of time, when it shall be left to that
world to do it in which there is no succession of generations.

II\. What we must give to God the glory of.

1\. Of his greatness and his great works. We must declare, Great is the
Lord, his presence infinite, his power irresistible, his brightness
insupportable, his majesty awful, his dominion boundless, and his
sovereignty incontestable; and therefore there is no dispute, but great
is the Lord, and, if great, then greatly to be praised, with all that is
within us, to the utmost of our power, and with all the circumstances of
solemnity imaginable. His greatness indeed cannot be comprehended, for
it is unsearchable; who can conceive or express how great God is? But
then it is so much the more to be praised. When we cannot, by searching,
find the bottom, we must sit down at the brink, and adore the depth,
[Rom 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033). God is great, for, (1..md)
His majesty is glorious in the upper world, above the heavens, where he
has set his glory; and when we are declaring his greatness we must not
fail to speak of the glorious honour of his majesty, the splendour of
the glory of his majesty ([Psa 145:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#005).md),
how brightly he shines in the upper world, so as to dazzle the eyes of
the angels themselves, and oblige them to cover their faces, as unable
to bear the lustre of it. (2.) His works are wondrous in this lower
world. The preservation, maintenance, and government of all the
creatures, proclaim the Creator very great. When therefore we declare
his greatness we must observe the unquestionable proofs of it, and must
declare his mighty acts ([Psa 145:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#004).md),
speak of his wondrous works ([Psa
145:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#005).md), the might of his terrible
acts, [Psa 145:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#006.md). We must see God
acting and working in all the affairs of this lower world. Various
instruments are used, but in all events God is the supreme director; it
is he that performs all things. Much of his power is seen in the
operations of his providence (they are mighty acts, such as cannot be
paralleled by the strength of any creature), and much of his justice -
they are terrible acts, awful to saints, dreadful to sinners. These we
should take all occasions to speak of, observing the finger of God, his
hand, his arm, in all, that we may marvel.

2\. Of his goodness; this is his glory, [Exo
33:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#019.md). It is what he glories in ([Exo
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006.md), [Exo
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#007).md), and it is what we must give him
the glory of: They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great
goodness, [Psa 145:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#007.md). God's goodness
is great goodness, the treasures of it can never be exhausted, nay, they
can never be lessened, for he ever will be as rich in mercy as he ever
was. It is memorable goodness; it is what we ought always to lay before
us, always to have in mind and preserve the memorials of, for it is
worthy to be had in everlasting remembrance; and the remembrance we
retain of God's goodness we should utter, we should abundantly utter, as
those who are full of it, very full of it, and desire that others may be
acquainted and affected with it. But, whenever we utter God's great
goodness, we must not forget, at the same time, to sing of his
righteousness; for, as he is gracious in rewarding those that serve him
faithfully, so he is righteous in punishing those that rebel against
him. Impartial and inflexible justice is as surely in God as
inexhaustible goodness; and we must sing of both together, [Rom
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#022). (1..md) There is a fountain of
goodness in God's nature ([Psa 145:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#008).md):
The Lord is gracious to those that serve him; he is full of compassion
to those that need him, slow to anger to those that have offended him,
and of great mercy to all that seek him and sue to him. he is ready to
give, and ready to forgive, more ready than we are to ask, than we are
to repent. (2.) There are streams of goodness in all the dispensations
of his providence, [Psa 145:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#009.md). As he
is good, so he does good; he is good to all, to all his creatures, from
the highest angel to the meanest worm, to all but devils and damned
sinners, that have shut themselves out from his goodness. His tender
mercies are over all his works. \[1.\] All his works, all his creatures,
receive the fruits of his merciful care and bounty. It is extended to
them all; he hates nothing that he has made. \[2.\] The works of his
mercy out-shine all his other works, and declare him more than any of
them. In nothing will the glory of God be for ever so illustrious as in
the vessels of mercy ordained to glory. To the divine goodness will the
everlasting hallelujahs of all the saints be sung.

[Psalms 145:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 145:10</span></span>

The greatness and goodness of him who is optimus et maximus - the best
and greatest of beings, were celebrated in the former part of the psalm;
here, in these verses, we are taught to give him the glory of his
kingdom, in the administration of which his greatness and goodness shine
so clearly, so very brightly. Observe, as before,

I. From whom the tribute of praise is expected ([Psa
145:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#010).md): All God's works shall praise
him. They all minister to us matter for praise, and so praise him
according to their capacity; even those that refuse to give him honour
he will get himself honour upon. But his saints do bless him, not only
as they have peculiar blessings from him, which other creatures have
not, but as they praise him actively, while his other works praise him
only objectively. They bless him, for they collect the rent or tribute
of praise from the inferior creatures, and pay it into the treasury
above. All God's works do praise him, as the beautiful building praises
the builder or the well-drawn picture praises the painter; but the
saints bless him as the children of prudent tender parents rise up and
call them blessed. Of all God's works, his saints, the workmanship of
his grace, the first-fruits of his creatures, have most reason to bless
him.

II\. For what this praise is to be given: They shall speak of thy
kingdom. The kingdom of God among men is a thing to be often thought of
and often spoken of. As, before, he had magnified God's greatness and
goodness in general, so here he magnifies them with application to his
kingdom. Consider then,

1\. The greatness of his kingdom. It is great indeed, for all the kings
and kingdoms of the earth are under his control. To show the greatness
of God's kingdom, he observes, (1.) The pomp of it. Would we by faith
look within the veil, we should see, and, believing, we should speak of
the glory of his kingdom ([Psa
145:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#011).md), the glorious majesty of it
([Psa 145:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#012).md), for he has prepared his
throne in the heavens, and it is high and lifted up, and surrounded with
an innumerable company of angels. The courts of Solomon and Ahasuerus
were magnificent; but, compared with the glorious majesty of God's
kingdom, they were but as glow-worms to the sun. The consideration of
this should strike an awe upon us in all our approaches to God. (2.) The
power of it: When they speak of the glory of God's kingdom they must
talk of his power, the extent of it, the efficacy of it - his power, by
which he can do any thing and does every thing he pleases ([Psa
145:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#011).md); and, as a proof of it, let
them make known his mighty acts ([Psa
145:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#012).md), that the sons of men may be
invited to yield themselves his willing subjects and so put themselves
under the protection of such a mighty potentate. (3.) The perpetuity of
it, [Psa 145:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#013.md). The thrones of
earthly princes totter, and the flowers of their crowns wither,
monarchies come to an end; but, Lord, thy kingdom is an everlasting
kingdom. God will govern the world to the end of time, when the
Mediator, who is now entrusted with the administration of his kingdom,
shall deliver it up to God, even the Father, that he may be all in all
to eternity. His dominion endures throughout all generations, for he
himself is eternal, and his counsels are unchangeable and uniform; and
Satan, who has set up a kingdom in opposition to him, is conquered and
in a chain.

2\. The goodness of his kingdom. His royal style and title are, The Lord
God, gracious and merciful; and his government answers to his title. The
goodness of God appears in what he does,

(1.) For all the creatures in general ([Psa
145:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#015.md), [Psa
145:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#016).md): He provides food for all
flesh, and therein appears his everlasting mercy, [Psa
136:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#025.md). All the creatures live upon
God, and, as they had their being from him at first, so from him they
have all the supports of their being and on him they depend for the
continuance of it. \[1.\] The eye of their expectation attends upon him:
The eyes of all wait on thee. The inferior creatures indeed have not the
knowledge of God, nor are capable of it, and yet they are said to wait
upon God, because they seek their food according to the instinct which
the God of nature has put into them (and they sow not, neither do they
reap, [Mat 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#026).md), and because they
take what the God of nature has provided for them, in the time and way
that he has appointed, and are content with it. \[2.\] The hand of his
bounty is stretched out to them: Thou givest them their meat in due
season, the meat proper for them, and in the proper time, when they need
it; so that none of the creatures ordinarily perish for want of food,
no, not in the winter. Thou openest thy hand freely and liberally, and
satisfiest the desire of every living thing, except some of the
unreasonable children of men, that will be satisfied with nothing, but
are still complaining, still crying, Give, give.

(2.) For the children of men in particular, whom he governs as
reasonable creatures.

\[1.\] He does none of them any wrong, for ([Psa
145:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#017).md) the Lord is righteous in all
his ways, and not unrighteous in any of them; he is holy, and acts like
himself, with a perfect rectitude in all his works. In all the acts of
government he is just, injurious to none, but administering justice to
all. The ways of the lord are equal, though ours are unequal. In giving
laws, in deciding controversies, in recompensing services, and punishing
offences, he is incontestably just, and we are bound to own that he is
so.

\[2.\] He does all of them good, his own people in a special manner.

First, He supports those that are sinking, and it is his honour to help
the weak, [Psa 145:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#014.md). He upholds all
that fall, in that, though they fall, they are not utterly cast down.
Many of the children of men are brought very low by sickness and other
distresses, and seem ready to drop into the grave, and yet Providence
wonderfully upholds them, raises them up, and says, Return, [Psa
110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md). If all had died who once seemed
dying, the world would have been very thin. Many of the children of God,
who have been ready to fall into sin, to fall into despair, have
experienced his goodness in preventing their falls, or recovering them
speedily by his graces and comforts, so that, though they fell, they
were not utterly cast down, [Psa
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#024.md). If those who were bowed down by
oppression and affliction are raised up, it was God that raised them.
And, with respect to all those that are heavy-laden under the burden of
sin, if they come to Christ by faith, he will ease them, he will raise
them.

Secondly, He is very ready to hear and answer the prayers of his people,
[Psa 145:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#018.md), [Psa
145:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#019.md). In this appears the grace of
his kingdom, that his subjects have not only liberty of petitioning, but
all the encouragement that can be to petition. 1. The grant is very
rich, that God will be nigh to all that call upon him; he will be always
within call of their prayers, and they shall always find themselves
within reach of his help. If a neighbour that is near is better than a
brother afar off ([Pro 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#010).md), much
more a God that is near. Nay, he will not only be nigh to them, that
they may have the satisfaction of being heard, but he will fulfil their
desires; they shall have what they ask and find that they seek. It was
said ([Psa 145:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#016).md) that he satisfies
the desire of every living thing, much more will he fulfil the desire of
those that fear him; for he that feeds his birds will not starve his
babes. He will hear their call and will save them; that is hearing them
to purpose, as he heard David (that is, saved him) from the horn of the
unicorn, [Psa 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#021.md). 2. The proviso is
very reasonable. He will hear and help us, (1.) If we fear him, if we
worship and serve him with a holy awe of him; for otherwise how can we
expect that he should accept us? (2.) If we call upon him in truth; for
he desires truth in the inward part. We must be faithful to God, and
sincere in our professions of dependence on him, and devotedness to him.
In all devotions inward impressions must be answerable to the outward
expressions, else they are not performed in truth.

Thirdly, He takes those under his special protection who have a
confidence and complacency in him ([Psa
145:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#020).md): The Lord preserves all those
that love him; they lie exposed in this world, but he, by preserving
them in their integrity, will effectually secure them, that no real evil
shall befal them.

\[3.\] If any are destroyed they may thank themselves: All the wicked he
will destroy, but they have by their wickedness fitted themselves for
destruction. This magnifies his goodness in the protection of the
righteous, that with their eyes they shall see the reward of the wicked
([Psa 91:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#008).md); and God will by this
means preserve his people, even by destroying the wicked that would do
them a mischief.

Lastly, The psalmist concludes, 1. With a resolution to give glory to
God himself ([Psa 145:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#021).md): My mouth
shall speak the praise of the Lord. When we have said what we can, in
praising God, still there is more to be said, and therefore we must not
only begin our thanksgivings with this purpose, as he did ([Psa
145:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#001).md), but conclude them with it, as
he does here, because we shall presently have occasion to begin again.
As the end of one mercy is the beginning of another, so should the end
of one thanksgiving be. While I have breath to draw, my mouth shall
still speak God's praises. 2. With a call to others to do so too: Let
all flesh, all mankind, bless his holy name for ever and ever. Some of
mankind shall be blessing God for ever; it is a pity but that they
should be all so engaged.
