### [Numbers Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 30:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have a law concerning vows, which had been mentioned
in the close of the foregoing chapter. I. Here is a general rule laid
down that all vows must be carefully performed ([Num
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#001.md), [Num
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#002).md). II. Some particular exceptions
to this rule. 1. That the vows of daughters should not be binding unless
allowed by the father ([Num 30:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#003).md).
Nor, 2. The vows of wives unless allowed by the husband ([Num
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#006), etc..md).

[Numbers 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 30:1</span></span>

This law was delivered to the heads of the tribes that they might
instruct those who were under their charge, explain the law to them,
give then necessary cautions, and call them to account, if there were
occasion, for the breach of their vows. Perhaps the heads of the tribes
had, upon some emergency of this kind, consulted Moses, and desired by
him to know the mind of God, and here they are told it: This is the
thing which the Lord has commanded concerning vows, and it is a command
still in force.

1\. The case supposed is that a person vows a vow unto the Lord, making
God a party to the promise, and designing his honour and glory in it.
The matter of the vow is supposed to be something lawful: no man can be
by his own promise bound to do that which he is already by the divine
precept prohibited from doing. Yet it is supposed to be something which,
in such and such measures and degrees, was not a necessary duty
antecedent to the vow. A person might vow to bring such and such
sacrifices at certain times, to give such and such a sum or such a
proportion in alms, to forbear such meats and drinks which the law
allowed, to fast and afflict the soul (which is specified [Num
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#013).md) at other times besides the day
of atonement. And many similar vows might be made in an extraordinary
heat of holy zeal, in humiliation for some sin committed or for the
prevention of sin, in the pursuit of some mercy desired or in gratitude
for some mercy received. It is of great use to make such vows as these,
provided they be made in sincerity with due caution. Vows (say the
Jewish doctors) are the hedge of separation, that is, a fence to
religion. He that vows is here said to bind his soul with a bond. It is
a vow to God, who is a spirit, and to him the soul, with all its powers,
must be bound. A promise to man is a bond upon the estate, but a promise
to God is a bond upon the soul. Our sacramental vows, by which we are
bound to no more than what was before our duty, and which neither father
nor husband can disannul, are bonds upon the soul, and by them we must
feel ourselves bound out from all sin and bound up to the whole will of
God. Our occasional vows concerning that which before was in our own
power ([Act 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#004).md), when they are made,
are bonds upon the soul likewise. 2. The command given is that these
vows be conscientiously performed: He shall not break his word, though
afterwards he may change his mind, but he shall do according to what he
has said. Margin, He shall not profane his word. Vowing is an ordinance
of God; if we vow in hypocrisy we profane that ordinance: it is plainly
determined, Better not vow than vow and not pay, [Ecc
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#005.md). Be not deceived, God is not
mocked. His promises to us are yea and amen, let not ours to him be yea
and nay.

[Numbers 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 30:3</span></span>

It is here taken for granted that all such persons as are sui juris - at
their own disposal, and are likewise of sound understanding and memory,
are bound to perform whatever they vow that is lawful and possible; but,
if the person vowing be under the dominion and at the disposal of
another, the case is different. Two cases much alike are here put and
determined: -

I. The case of a daughter in her father's house: and some think,
probably enough, that it extends to a son likewise, while he is at home
with his father, and under tutors and governors. Whether the exception
may thus be stretched I cannot say. Non est distinguendum, ubi lex non
distinguit - We are not allowed to make distinctions which the law does
not. The rule is general, If a man vow, he must pay. But for a daughter
it is express: her vow is nugatory or in suspense till her father knows
it, and (it is supposed) knows it from her; for, when it comes to his
knowledge, it is in his power either to ratify or nullify it. But in
favour of the vow, 1. Even his silence shall suffice to ratify it: If he
hold his peace, her vows shall stand, [Num
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#004.md). Qui tacet, consentire videtur -
Silence gives consent. Hereby he allows his daughter the liberty she has
assumed, and, as long as he says nothing against her vow, she shall be
bound by it. But, 2. His protestation against it shall perfectly
disannul it, because it is possible that such vow may by prejudicial to
the affairs of the family, break the father's measures, perplex the
provision made for his table if the vow related to meats, or lessen the
provision made for his children if the vow would be more expensive than
his estate would bear; however, it was certain that it was an
infringement of his authority over his child, and therefore, if he
disallow it, she is discharged, and the Lord shall forgive her, that is,
she shall not be charged with the guilt of violating her vow; she showed
her good-will in making the vow, and, if her intentions therein were
sincere, she shall be accounted better than sacrifice. This shows how
great a deference children owe to their parents, and how much they ought
to honour them and be obedient to them. It is for the interest of the
public that the paternal authority be supported; for, when children are
countenanced in their disobedience to their parents (as they were by the
tradition of the elders, [Mat 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#005.md),
[Mat 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#006).md), they soon become in other
things children of Belial. If this law be not to be extended to
children's marrying without their parents' consent so far as to put it
in parents' power to annul the marriage and dissolve the obligation (as
some have thought it does), yet certainly it proves the sinfulness of
it, and obliges the children that have thus done foolishly to repent and
humble themselves before God and their parents.

II\. The case of a wife is much the same. As for a woman that is a widow
or divorced, she has neither father nor husband to control her, so that,
whatever vows she binds her soul with, they shall stand against her
([Num 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#009).md), it is at her peril if she
run back; but a wife, who has nothing that she can strictly call her
own, but with her husband's allowance, cannot, without that, make any
such vow. 1. The law is plain in case of a wife that continues so long
after the vow. If her husband allow her vow, though only by silence, it
must stand, [Num 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#006.md), [Num
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#007.md). If he disallow it, since her
obligation to that which she had vowed arose purely from her own act,
and not from any prior command of God, her obligation to her husband
shall take place of it, for to him she ought to be in subjection as unto
the Lord; and now it is so far from being her duty to fulfil her vow
that it would be her sin to disobey her husband, whose consent perhaps
she ought to have asked before she made the vow; therefore she needs
forgiveness, [Num 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#008.md). 2. The law is
the same in case of a wife that soon after becomes a widow, or is put
away. Though, if she return to her father's house, she does not
therefore so come again under his authority as that he has power to
disannul hew vows ([Num 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#009).md), yet if
the vow was made while she was in the house of her husband, and her
husband disallowed it, it was made void and of no effect for ever, and
she does not return under the law of her vow when she is loosed from the
law of her husband. This seems to be the distinct meaning of [Num
30:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#010.md), which otherwise would be but
a repetition of [Num 30:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#006.md). But it is
added ([Num 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#015).md) that, if the
husband make void the vows of his wife, he shall bear her iniquity; that
is, if the thing she had vowed was really good, for the honour of God
and the prosperity of her own soul, and the husband disallowed it out of
covetousness, or humour, or to show his authority, though she be
discharged from the obligation of her vow, yet he will have a great deal
to answer for. Now here it is very observable how carefully the divine
law consults the good order of families, and preserves the power of
superior relations, and the duty and reverence of inferiors. It is fit
that every man should bear rule in his own house, and have his wife and
children in subjection with all gravity; and rather than this great rule
should be broken, or any encouragement given to inferior relations to
break those bonds asunder, God himself would quit his right, and release
the obligations even of a solemn vow; so much does religion strengthen
the ties of all relations, and secure the welfare of all societiesd,
that in it the families of the earth are blessed.
