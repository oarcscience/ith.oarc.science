### [Job Chapter 40](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 40:0</span></span>

Many humbling confounding questions God had put to Job, in the foregoing
chapter; now, in this chapter, I. He demands an answer to them ([Job
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#001.md), [Job
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#002).md). II. Job submits in a humble
silence ([Job 40:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#003).md). III. God
proceeds to reason with him, for his conviction, concerning the infinite
distance and disproportion between him and God, showing that he was by
no means an equal match for God. He challenges him ([Job
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#006.md), [Job
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#007).md) to vie with him, if he durst,
for justice ([Job 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#008).md), power ([Job
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#009).md), majesty ([Job
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#010).md), and dominion over the proud
([Job 40:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#011).md), and he gives an
instance of his power in one particular animal, here called "Behemoth,"
([Job 40:15-24](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#015).md).

[Job 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 40:1</span></span>

Here is, I. A humbling challenge which God gave to Job. After he had
heaped up many hard questions upon him, to show him, by his manifest
ignorance in the works of nature, what an incompetent judge he was of
the methods and designs of Providence, he clenches the nail with one
demand more, which stands by itself here as the application of the
whole. It should seem, God paused awhile, as Elihu had done, to give Job
time to say what he had to say, or to think of what God had said; but
Job was in such confusion that he remained silent, and therefore God
here put him upon replying, [Job 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#001.md),
[Job 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#002.md). This is not said to be
spoken out of the whirlwind, as before; and therefore some think God
said it in a still small voice, which wrought more upon Job than the
whirlwind did, as upon Elijah, [Kg1
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#012.md), [Kg1
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#013.md). My doctrine shall drop as the
rain, and then it does wonders. Though Job had not spoken any thing, yet
God is said to answer him; for he knows men's thoughts, and can return a
suitable answer to their silence. Here, 1. God puts a convincing
question to him: "Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct
him? Shall he pretend to dictate to God's wisdom or prescribe to his
will? Shall God receive instruction from every peevish complainer, and
change the measures he has taken to please him?" It is a question with
disdain. Shall any teach God knowledge? [Job
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#022.md). It is intimated that those who
quarrel with God do, in effect, go about to teach him how to mend his
work. For if we contend with men like ourselves, as not having done
well, we ought to instruct them how to do better; but is it a thing to
be suffered that any man should teach his Maker? He that contends with
God is justly looked upon as his enemy; and shall he pretend so far to
have prevailed in the contest as to prescribe to him? We are ignorant
and short-sighted, but before him all things are naked and open; we are
depending creatures, but he is the sovereign Creator; and shall we
pretend to instruct him? Some read it, Is it any wisdom to contend with
the Almighty? The answer is easy. No; it is the greatest folly in the
world. Is it wisdom to contend with him whom it will certainly be our
ruin to oppose and unspeakably our interest to submit to? 2. He demands
a speedy reply to it: "He that reproaches God let him answer this
question to his own conscience, and answer it thus, Far be it from me to
contend with the Almighty or to instruct him. Let him answer all those
questions which I have put, if he can. Let him answer for his
presumption and insolence, answer it at God's bar, to his confusion."
Those have high thoughts of themselves, and mean thoughts of God, who
reprove any thing he says or does.

II\. Job's humble submission thereupon. Now Job came to himself, and
began to melt into godly sorrow. When his friends reasoned with him he
did not yield; but the voice of the Lord is powerful. When the Spirit of
truth shall come, he shall convince. They had condemned him for a wicked
man; Elihu himself had been very sharp upon him ([Job
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#007.md), [Job
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#008.md), [Job
34:37](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#037).md); but God had not given him such
hard words. We may sometimes have reason to expect better treatment from
God, and a more candid construction of what we do, than we meet with
from our friends. This the good man is here overcome by, and yields
himself a conquered captive to the grace of God. 1. He owns himself an
offender, and has nothing to say in his own justification ([Job
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#004).md): "Behold, I am vile, not only
mean and contemptible, but vile and abominable, in my own eyes." He is
now sensible that he has sinned, and therefore calls himself vile. Sin
debases us, and penitents abase themselves, reproach themselves, are
ashamed, yea, even confounded. "I have acted undutifully to my Father,
ungratefully to my benefactor, unwisely for myself; and therefore I am
vile." Job now vilifies himself as much as ever he had justified and
magnified himself. Repentance changes men's opinion of themselves. Job
had been too bold in demanding a conference with God, and thought he
could make his part good with him: but now he is convinced of his error,
and owns himself utterly unable to stand before God or to produce any
thing worth his notice, the veriest dunghill-worm that ever crawled upon
God's ground. While his friends talked with him, he answered them, for
he thought himself as good as they; but, when God talked with him, he
had nothing to say, for, in comparison with him, he sees himself
nothing, less than nothing, worse than nothing, vanity and vileness
itself; and therefore, What shall I answer thee? God demanded an answer,
[Job 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#002.md). Here he gives the reason of
his silence; it was not because he was sullen, but because he was
convinced he had been in the wrong. Those that are truly sensible of
their own sinfulness and vileness dare not justify themselves before
God, but are ashamed that ever they entertained such a thought, and, in
token of their shame, lay their hand upon their mouth. 2. He promises
not to offend any more as he had done; for Elihu had told him that this
was meet to be said unto God. When we have spoken amiss we must repent
of it and not repeat it nor stand to it. He enjoins himself silence
([Job 40:4](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#004).md): "I will lay my hand upon
my mouth, will keep that as with a bridle, to suppress all passionate
thoughts which may arise in my mind, and keep them from breaking out in
intemperate speeches." It is bad to think amiss, but it is much worse to
speak amiss, for that is an allowance of the evil thought and gives it
an imprimatur - a sanction; it is publishing the seditious libel; and
therefore, if thou hast thought evil, lay thy hand upon thy mouth and
let it go no further ([Pro 30:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#032).md) and
that will be an evidence for thee that that which thou thoughtest thou
allowest not. Job had suffered his evil thoughts to vent themselves:
"Once have I spoken amiss, yea, twice," that is, "divers times, in one
discourse and in another; but I have done: I will not answer; I will not
stand to what I have said, nor say it again; I will proceed no further."
Observe here what true repentance is. (1.) It is to rectify our errors,
and the false principles we went upon in doing as we did. What we have
long, and often, and vigorously maintained, once, yea, twice, we must
retract as soon as we are convinced that it is a mistake, not adhere to
it any longer, but take shame to ourselves for holding it so long. (2.)
It is to return from every by-path and to proceed not one step further
in it: "I will not add" (so the word is); "I will never indulge my
passion so much again, nor give myself such a liberty of speech, will
never say as I have said nor do as I have done." Till it comes to this,
we come short of repentance. Further observe, Those who dispute with God
will be silenced at last. Job had been very bold and forward in
demanding a conference with God, and talked very boldly, how plain he
would make his case, and how sure he was that he should be justified. As
a prince he would go near unto him ([Job
31:37](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#037).md); he would come even to his seat
([Job 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#003).md); but he has soon enough of
it; he lets fall his plea and will not answer. "Lord, the wisdom and
right are all on thy side, and I have done foolishly and wickedly in
questioning them."

[Job 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 40:6</span></span>

Job was greatly humbled for what God had already said, but not
sufficiently; he was brought low, but not low enough; and therefore God
here proceeds to reason with him in the same manner and to the same
purport as before, [Job 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#006.md). Observe,
1. Those who duly receive what they have heard from God, and profit by
it, shall hear more from him. 2. Those who are truly convinced of sin,
and penitent for it, yet have need to be more thoroughly convinced and
to be made more deeply penitent. Those who are under convictions, who
have their sins set in order before their eyes and their hearts broken
for them, must learn from this instance not to catch at comfort too
soon; it will be everlasting when it comes, and therefore it is
necessary that we be prepared for it by deep humiliation, that the wound
be searched to the bottom and not skinned over, and that we do not make
more haste out of our convictions than good speed. When our hearts begin
to melt and relent within us, let those considerations be dwelt upon and
pursued which will help to make a thorough effectual thaw of it.

God begins with a challenge ([Job
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#007).md), as before ([Job
38:3](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#003).md): "Gird up thy loins now like a
man; if thou hast the courage and confidence thou hast pretended to,
show them now; but thou wilt soon be made to see and own thyself no
match for me." This is that which every proud heart must be brought to
at last, either by its repentance or by its ruin; and thus low must
every mountain and hill be, sooner or later, brought. We must
acknowledge,

I. That we cannot vie with God for justice, that the Lord is righteous
and holy in his dealings with us, but that we are unrighteous and unholy
in our conduct towards him; we have a great deal to blame ourselves for,
but nothing to blame him for ([Job
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#008).md): "Wilt thou disannul my
judgment? Wilt thou take exceptions to what I say and do, and bring a
writ of error, to reverse the judgment I have given as erroneous and
unjust?" Many of Job's complaints had too much of a tendency this way: I
cry out of wrong, says he, but I am not heard; but such language as this
is by no means to be suffered. God's judgment cannot, must not, be
disannulled, for we are sure it is according to truth, and therefore it
is a great piece of impudence and iniquity in us to call in question.
"Wilt thou," says God, "condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? Must
my honour suffer for the support of thy reputation? Must I be charged as
dealing unjustly with thee because thou canst not otherwise clear
thyself from the censures thou liest under?" Our duty is to condemn
ourselves, that God may be righteous. David is therefore ready to own
the evil he has done in God's sight, that God may be justified when he
speaks and clear when he judges, [Psa
51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004.md). See [Neh
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#033.md); [Dan
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#007.md). But those are very proud, and
very ignorant both of God and themselves, who, to clear themselves, will
condemn God; and the day is coming when, if the mistake be not rectified
in time by repentance, the eternal judgment will be both the confutation
of the plea and the confusion of the prisoner, for the heavens shall
declare God's righteousness and all the world shall become guilty before
him.

II\. That we cannot vie with God for power; and therefore, as it is
great impiety, so it is great impudence to contest with him, and is as
much against our interest as it is against reason and justice ([Job
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#009).md): "Hast thou an arm like God,
equal to his in length and strength? Or canst thou thunder with a voice
like him, as he did ([Job 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#001.md), [Job
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#002).md), or does now out of the
whirlwind?" To convince Job that he was not so able as he thought
himself to contest with God, he shows him, 1. That he could never fight
it out with him, nor carry his cause by force of arms. Sometimes, among
men, controversies have been decided by battle, and the victorious
champion is adjudged to have justice on his side; but, if the
controversy were put upon that issue between God and man, man would
certainly go by the worse, for all the forces he could raise against the
Almighty would be but like briers and thorns before a consuming fire,
[Isa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#004.md). "Hast thou, a poor weak
worm of the earth, an arm comparable to his who upholds all things?" The
power of creatures, even of angels themselves, is derived from God,
limited by him, and dependent on him; but the power of God is original,
independent, and unlimited. He can do every thing without us; we can do
nothing without him; and therefore we have not an arm like God. 2. That
he could never talk it out with him, nor carry his cause by noise and
big words, which sometimes among men go a great way towards the gaining
of a point: "Canst thou thunder with a voice like him? No; his voice
will soon drown thine and one of his thunders will overpower and
overrule all thy whispers." Man cannot speak so convincingly, so
powerfully, nor with such a commanding conquering force as God can, who
speaks, and it is done. his creating voice is called his thunder ([Psa
104:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#007).md), so is that voice of his with
which he terrifies and discomfits his enemies, [Sa1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010.md). The wrath of a king may
sometimes be like the roaring of a lion, but can never pretend to
imitate God's thunder.

III\. That we cannot vie with God for beauty and majesty, [Job
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#010.md). "If thou wilt enter into a
comparison with him, and appear more amiable, put on thy best attire:
Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency. Appear in all the martial
pomp, in all the royal pageantry that thou hast; make the best of every
thing that will set thee off: Array thyself with glory and beauty, such
as may awe thy enemies and charm thy friends; but what is it all to the
divine majesty and beauty? No more than the light of a glow-worm to that
of the sun when he goes forth in his strength." God decks himself with
such majesty and glory as are the terror of devils and all the powers of
darkness and make them tremble; he arrays himself with such glory and
beauty as are the wonder of angels and all the saints in light and make
them rejoice. David could dwell all his days in God's house, to behold
the beauty of the Lord. But, in comparison with this, what is all the
majesty and excellency by which princes think to make themselves feared,
and all the glory and beauty by which lovers think to make themselves
beloved? If Job think, in contending with God, to carry the day by
looking great and making a figure, he is quite mistaken. The sun shall
be ashamed, and the moon confounded, when God shines forth.

IV\. That we cannot vie with God for dominion over the proud, [Job
40:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#011.md). here the cause is put upon
this short issue: if Job can humble and abase proud tyrants and
oppressors as easily and effectually as God can, it shall be
acknowledged that he has some colour to compete with God. Observe here,

1\. The justice Job is here challenged to do, and that is to bring the
proud low with a look. If Job will pretend to be a rival with God,
especially if he pretend to be a judge of his actions, he must be able
to do this.

(1.) It is here supposed that God can do it and will do it himself, else
he would not have put it thus upon Job. By this God proves himself to be
God, that he resists the proud, sits Judge upon them, and is able to
bring them to ruin. Observe here, \[1.\] That proud people are wicked
people, and pride is at the bottom of a great deal of the wickedness
that is in this world both towards God and man. \[2.\] Proud people will
certainly be abased and brought low; for pride goes before destruction.
If they bend not, they will break; if they humble not themselves by true
repentance, God will humble them, to their everlasting confusion. The
wicked will be trodden down in their place, that is, Wherever they are
found, though they pretend to have a place of their own, and to have
taken root in it, yet even there they shall be trodden down, and all the
wealth, and power, and interest, to which their place entitles them,
will not be their security. \[3.\] The wrath of God, scattered among the
proud, will humble them, and break them, and bring them down. If he
casts abroad the rage of his wrath, as he will do at the great day and
sometimes does in this life, the stoutest heart cannot hold out against
him. Who knows the power of his anger? \[4.\] God can and does easily
abase proud tyrants; he can look upon them, and bring them low, can
overwhelm them with shame, and fear, and utter ruin, by one angry look,
as he can, by a gracious look, revive the hearts of the contrite ones.
\[5.\] He can and will at last do it effectually ([Job
40:13](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#013).md), not only bring them to the
dust, from which they might hope to arise, but hide them in the dust,
like the proud Egyptian whom Moses slew and hid in the sand ([Exo
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#012).md), that is, they shall be brought
not only to death, but to the grave, that pit out of which there is no
return. They were proud of the figure they made, but they shall be
buried in oblivion and be no more remembered than those that are hidden
in the dust, out of sight and out of mind. They were linked in leagues
and confederacies to do mischief, and are now bound in bundles. They are
hidden together; not their rest, but their shame together is in the
dust, [Job 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#016.md). Nay, they are
treated as malefactors (who, when condemned, had their faces covered, as
Haman's was: He binds their faces in secret) or as dead men: Lazarus, in
the grave, had his face bound about. Thus complete will be the victory
that God will gain, at last, over proud sinners that set themselves in
opposition to him. Now by this he proves himself to be God. Does he thus
hate proud men? Then he is holy. Will he thus punish them? Then he is
the just Judge of the world. Can he thus humble them? Then he is the
Lord Almighty. When he had abased proud Pharaoh, and hidden him in the
sand of the Red Sea, Jethro thence inferred that doubtless the Lord is
greater than all gods, for wherein the proud enemies of his Israel dealt
proudly he was above them, he was too hard for them, [Exo
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#011.md). See [Rev
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001.md), [Rev
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#002.md).

(2.) It is here proposed to Job to do it. He had been passionately
quarrelling with God and his providence, casting abroad the rage of his
wrath towards heaven, as if he thought thereby to bring God himself to
his mind. "Come," says God, "try thy hand first upon proud men, and thou
wilt soon see how little they value the rage of thy wrath; and shall I
then regard it, or be moved by it?" Job had complained of the prosperity
and power of tyrants and oppressors, and was ready to charge God with
mal-administration for suffering it; but he ought not to find fault,
except he could mend. If God, and he only, has power enough to humble
and bring down proud men, no doubt he has wisdom enough to know when and
how to do it, and it is not for us to prescribe to him or to teach him
how to prescribe to him or to teach him how to govern the world. Unless
we had an arm like God we must not think to take his work out of his
hands.

2\. The justice which is here promised to be done him if he can perform
such mighty works as these ([Job
40:14](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#014).md): "They will I also confess unto
thee that thy right hand is sufficient to save thee, though, after all,
it would be too weak to contend with me." It is the innate pride and
ambition of man that he would be his own saviour (would have his own
hands sufficient for him and be independent), but it is presumption to
pretend that he is. Our own hands cannot save us by recommending us to
God's grace, much less by rescuing us from his justice. Unless we could
by our own power humble our enemies, we cannot pretend by our own power
to save ourselves; but, if we could, God himself would confess it. He
never did nor ever will defraud any man of his just praise, nor deny him
the honour he has merited. But, since we cannot do this, we must confess
unto him that our own hands cannot save us, and therefore into his hand
we must commit ourselves.

[Job 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 40:15</span></span>

God, for the further proving of his own power and disproving of Job's
pretensions, concludes his discourse with the description of two vast
and mighty animals, far exceeding man in bulk and strength, one he calls
behemoth, the other leviathan. In these verses we have the former
described. "Behold now behemoth, and consider whether thou art able to
contend with him who made that beast and gave him all the power he has,
and whether it is not thy wisdom rather to submit to him and make thy
peace with him." Behemoth signifies beasts in general, but must here be
meant of some one particular species. Some understand it of the bull;
others of an amphibious animal, well known (they say) in Egypt, called
the river-horse (hippopotamus), living among the fish in the river Nile,
but coming out to feed upon the earth. But I confess I see no reason to
depart from the ancient and most generally received opinion, that it is
the elephant that is here described, which is a very strong stately
creature, of very large stature above any other, of wonderful sagacity,
and of so great a reputation in the animal kingdom that among so many
four-footed beasts as we have had the natural history of (ch. 38 and 39)
we can scarcely suppose this should be omitted. Observe,

I. The description here given of the behemoth.

1\. His body is very strong and well built. His strength is in his
loins, [Job 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#016.md). His bones, compared
with those of other creatures, are like bars of iron, [Job
40:18](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#018.md). His back-bone is so strong
that, though his tail be not large, yet he moves it like a cedar, with a
commanding force, [Job 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#017.md). Some
understand it of the trunk of the elephant, for the word signifies any
extreme part, and in that there is indeed a wonderful strength. So
strong is the elephant in his back and loins, and the sinews of his
thighs, that he will carry a large wooden tower, and a great number of
fighting men in it. No animal whatsoever comes near the elephant for
strength of body, which is the main thing insisted on in this
description.

2\. He feeds on the productions of the earth and does not prey upon
other animals: He eats grass as an ox ([Job
40:15](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#015).md), the mountains bring him forth
food ([Job 40:20](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#020).md), and the beasts of
the field do not tremble before him nor flee from him, as from a lion,
but they play about him, knowing they are in no danger from him. This
may give us occasion, (1.) To acknowledge the goodness of God in
ordering it so that a creature of such bulk, which requires so much
food, should not feed upon flesh (for then multitudes must die to keep
him alive), but should be content with the grass of the field, to
prevent such destruction of lives as otherwise must have ensued. (2.) To
commend living upon herbs and fruits without flesh, according to the
original appointment of man's food, [Gen
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#029.md). Even the strength of an
elephant, as of a horse and an ox, may be supported without flesh; and
why not that of a man? Though therefore we use the liberty God has
allowed us, yet be not among riotous eaters of flesh, [Pro
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#020). (3..md) To commend a quiet and
peaceable life. Who would not rather, like the elephant, have his
neighbours easy and pleasant about him, than, like the lion, have them
all afraid of him?

3\. He lodges under the shady trees ([Job
40:21](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#021).md), which cover him with their
shadow ([Job 40:22](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#022).md), where he has a
free and open air to breathe in, while lions, which live by prey, when
they would repose themselves, are obliged to retire into a close and
dark den, to live therein, and to abide in the covert of that, [Job
38:40](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#040.md). Those who are a terror to
others cannot but be sometimes a terror to themselves too; but those
will be easy who will let others be easy about them; and the reed and
fens, and the willows of the brook, though a very weak and slender
fortification, yet are sufficient for the defence and security of those
who therefore dread no harm, because they design none.

4\. That he is a very great and greedy drinker, not of wine or strong
drink (to be greedy of that is peculiar to man, who by his drunkenness
makes a beast of himself), but of fair water. (1.) His size is
prodigious, and therefore he must have supply accordingly, [Job
40:23](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#023.md). He drinks so much that one
would think he could drink up a river, if you would give him time, and
not hasten him. Or, when he drinks, he hasteth not, as those do that
drink in fear; he is confident of his own strength and safety, and
therefore makes no haste when he drinks, no more haste than good speed.
(2.) His eye anticipates more than he can take; for, when he is very
thirsty, having been long kept without water, he trusts that he can
drink up Jordan in his mouth, and even takes it with his eyes, [Job
40:24](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#024.md). As a covetous man causes his
eyes to fly upon the wealth of this world, which he is greedy of, so
this great beast is said to snatch, or draw up, even a river with his
eyes. (3.) His nose has in it strength enough for both; for, when he
goes greedily to drink with it, he pierces through snares or nets, which
perhaps are laid in the waters to catch fish. He makes nothing of the
difficulties that lie in his way, so great is his strength and so eager
his appetite.

II\. The use that is to be made of this description. We have taken a
view of this mountain of a beast, this over-grown animal, which is here
set before us, not merely as a show (as sometimes it is in our country)
to satisfy our curiosity and to amuse us, but as an argument with us to
humble ourselves before the great God; for, 1. He made this vast animal,
which is so fearfully and wonderfully made; it is the work of his hands,
the contrivance of his wisdom, the production of his power; it is
behemoth which I made, [Job 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#015.md).
Whatever strength this, or any other creature, has, it is derived from
God, who therefore must be acknowledged to have all power originally and
infinitely in himself, and such an arm as it is not for us to contest
with. This beast is here called the chief, in its kind, of the ways of
God ([Job 40:19](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#019).md), an eminent instance
of the Creator's power and wisdom. Those that will peruse the accounts
given by historians of the elephant will find that his capacities
approach nearer to those of reason than the capacities of any other
brute-creature whatsoever, and therefore he is fitly called the chief of
the ways of God, in the inferior part of the creation, no creature below
man being preferable to him. 2. He made him with man, as he made other
four-footed beasts, on the same day with man ([Gen
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#025.md), [Gen
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026).md), whereas the fish and fowl were
made the day before; he made him to live and move on the same earth, in
the same element, and therefore man and beast are said to be jointly
preserved by divine Providence as fellow-commoners, [Psa
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#006.md). "It is behemoth, which I made
with thee; I made that beast as well as thee, and he does not quarrel
with me; why then dost thou? Why shouldst thou demand peculiar favours
because I made thee ([Job 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#009).md), when
I made the behemoth likewise with thee? I made thee as well as that
beast, and therefore can as easily manage thee at pleasure as that
beast, and will do it whether thou refuse or whether thou choose. I made
him with thee, that thou mayest look upon him and receive instruction."
We need not go far for proofs and instances of God's almighty power and
sovereign dominion; they are near us, they are with us, they are under
our eye wherever we are. 3. He that made him can make his sword to
approach to him ([Job 40:19](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#019).md), that is,
the same hand that made him, notwithstanding his great bulk and
strength, can unmake him again at pleasure and kill an elephant as
easily as a worm or a fly, without any difficulty, and without the
imputation either of waste or wrong. God that gave to all the creatures
their being may take away the being he gave; for may he not do what he
will with his own? And he can do it; he that has power to create with a
word no doubt has power to destroy with a word, and can as easily speak
the creature into nothing as at first he spoke it out of nothing. The
behemoth perhaps is here intended (as well as the leviathan afterwards)
to represent those proud tyrants and oppressors whom God had just now
challenged Job to abase and bring down. They think themselves as well
fortified against the judgments of God as the elephant with his bones of
brass and iron; but he that made the soul of man knows all the avenues
to it, and can make the sword of justice, his wrath, to approach to it,
and touch it in the most tender and sensible part. He that framed the
engine, and put the parts of it together, knows how to take it in
pieces. Woe to him therefore that strives with his Maker, for he that
made him has therefore power to make him miserable, and will not make
him happy unless he will be ruled by him.
