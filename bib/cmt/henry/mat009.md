### [Matthew Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#001.md)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 9:0</span></span>

We have in this chapter remarkable instances of the power and pity of
the Lord Jesus, sufficient to convince us that he is both able to save
to the uttermost all that come to God by him, and as willing as he is
able. His power and pity appear here in the good offices he did, I. To
the bodies of people, in curing the palsy ([Mat
9:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002).md); raising to life the ruler's
daughter, and healing the bloody issue ([Mat
9:18-26](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#018).md); giving sight to two blind
men ([Mat 9:27-31](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#027).md); casting the devil
out of one possessed ([Mat 9:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#032).md);
and healing all manner of sickness ([Mat
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#035).md). II. To the souls of people; in
forgiving sins ([Mat 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002).md); calling
Matthew, and conversing freely with publicans and sinners ([Mat
9:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#009).md); considering the frame of his
disciples, with reference to the duty of fasting ([Mat
9:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#014).md); preaching the gospel, and,
in compassion to the multitude, providing preachers for them ([Mat
9:35-38](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#035).md). Thus did he prove himself to
be, as undoubtedly he is, the skilful, faithful Physician, both of soul
and body, who has sufficient remedies for all the maladies of both: for
which we must, therefore, apply ourselves to him, and glorify him both
with our bodies and with our spirits, which are his, in return to him
for his kindness to both.

[Matthew 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 9:1</span></span>

The first words of this chapter oblige us to look back to the close of
that which precedes it, where we find the Gadarenes so resenting the
loss of their swine, that they were disgusted with Christ's company, and
besought him to depart out of their coasts. Now here it follows, He
entered into a ship, and passed over. They bid him begone, and he took
them at their word, and we never read that he came into their coasts
again. Now here observe, 1. His justice - that he left them. Note,
Christ will not tarry long where he is not welcome. In righteous
judgment, he forsakes those places and persons that are weary of him,
but abides with those that covet and court his stay. If the unbeliever
will depart from Christ, let him depart; it is at his peril, [Co1
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#015.md). 2. His patience - that he did
not leave some destroying judgment behind him, to punish them, as they
deserved, for their contempt and contumacy. How easily, how justly,
might he have sent them after their swine, who were already so much
under the devil's power. The provocation, indeed, was very great: but he
put it up, and passed it by; and, without any angry resentments or
upbraidings, he entered into a ship, and passed over. This was the day
of his patience; he came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them;
not to kill, but to cure. Spiritual judgments agree more with the
constitution of gospel times; yet some observe, that in those bloody
wars which the Romans made upon the Jews, which began not many years
after this, they first besieged the town of Gadara, where these
Gadarenes dwelt. Note, Those that drive Christ from them, draw all
miseries upon them. Woe unto us, if God depart from us.

He came into his own city, Capernaum, the principal place of his
residence at present ([Mar 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#001).md), and
therefore called his own city. He had himself testified, that a prophet
it least honoured in his own country and city, yet thither he came; for
he sought not his own honour; but, being in a state of humiliation, he
was content to be despised of the people. At Capernaum all the
circumstances recorded in this chapter happened, and are, therefore, put
together here, though, in the harmony of the evangelists, other events
intervened. When the Gadarenes desired Christ to depart, they of
Capernaum received him. If Christ be affronted by some, there are others
in whom he will be glorious; if one will not, another will.

Now the first occurrence, after Christ's return to Capernaum, as
recorded in these verses, was the cure of the man sick of the palsy. In
which we may observe,

I. The faith of his friends in bringing him to Christ. His distemper was
such, that he could not come to Christ himself, but as he was carried.
Note, Even the halt and the lame may be brought to Christ, and they
shall not be rejected by him. If we do as well as we can, he will accept
of us. Christ had an eye to their faith. Little children cannot go to
Christ themselves, but he will have an eye to the faith of those that
bring them, and it shall not be in vain. Jesus saw their faith, the
faith of the paralytic himself, as well as of them that brought him;
Jesus saw the habit of faith, though his distemper, perhaps, impaired
his intellect, and obstructed the actings of it. Now their faith was, 1.
A strong faith; they firmly believed that Jesus Christ both could and
would heal him; else they would not have brought the sick man to him so
publicly, and through so much difficulty. 2. A humble faith; though the
sick man was unable to stir a step, they would not ask Christ to make
him a visit, but brought him to attend on Christ. It is fitter than we
should wait on Christ, than he on us. 3. An active faith: in the belief
of Christ's power and goodness, they brought the sick man to him, lying
on a bed, which could not be done without a deal of pains. Note, A
strong faith regards no obstacles in pressing after Christ.

II\. The favour of Christ, in what he said to him; Son, be of good
cheer, thy sins be forgiven thee. This was a sovereign cordial to a sick
man, and was enough to make all his bed in his sickness; and to make it
easy to him. We read not of any thing said to Christ; probably the poor
sick man could not speak for himself, and they that brought him chose
rather to speak by actions than words; they set him before Christ; that
was enough. Note, It is not in vain to present ourselves and our friends
to Christ, as the objects of his pity. Misery cries as well as sin, and
mercy is no less quick of hearing than justice. Here is, in what Christ
said, 1. A kind compellation; Son. Note, Exhortations and consolations
to the afflicted speak to them as to sons, for afflictions are fatherly
discipline, [Heb 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#005.md). 2. A gracious
encouragement; "Be of good cheer. Have a good heart on it; cheer up thy
spirits." Probably the poor man, when let down among them all in his
bed, was put out of countenance, was afraid of a rebuke for being
brought in so rudely: but Christ does not stand upon ceremony; he bids
him be of good cheer; all would be well, he should not be laid before
Christ in vain. Christ bids him be of good cheer; and then cures him. He
would have those to whom he deals his gifts, to be cheerful in seeking
him, and in trusting in him; to be of good courage. 3. A good reason for
that encouragement; Thy sins are forgiven thee. Now this may be
considered, (1.) as an introduction to the cure of his bodily distemper;
"Thy sins are pardoned, and therefore thou shalt be healed." Note, As
sin is the cause of sickness, so the remission of sin is the comfort of
recovery from sickness; not but that sin may be pardoned, and yet the
sickness not removed; not but that the sickness may be removed, and yet
the sin not pardoned: but if we have the comfort of our reconciliation
to God, with the comfort of our recovery from sickness, this makes it a
mercy indeed to us, as to Hezekiah, [Isa
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#017). Or, (2..md) As a reason of the
command to be of good cheer, whether he were cured of his disease or
not; "Though I should not heal thee, wilt thou not say thou hast not
sought in vain, if I assure thee that thy sins are pardoned; and wilt
thou not look upon that as a sufficient ground of comfort, though thou
shouldst continue sick of the palsy?" Note, They who, through grace,
have some evidence of the forgiveness of their sins, have reasons to be
of good cheer, whatever outward troubles or afflictions they are under;
see [Isa 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#024.md).

III\. The cavil of the scribes at that which Christ said ([Mat
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#003).md); They said within themselves, in
their hearts, among themselves, in their secret whisperings, This man
blasphemeth. See how the greatest instance of heaven's power and grace
is branded with the blackest note of hell's enmity; Christ's pardoning
sin is termed blasphemy; nor had it been less, if he had not had
commission from God for it. They, therefore, are guilty of blasphemy,
that have no such commission, and yet pretend to pardon sin.

IV\. The conviction which Christ gave them of the unreasonableness of
this cavil, before he proceeded.

1\. He charged them with it. Though they did but say it within
themselves, he knew their thoughts. Note, Our Lord Jesus has the perfect
knowledge of all that we say within ourselves. Thoughts are secret and
sudden, yet naked and open before Christ, the eternal Word ([Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012.md), [Heb
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#013).md), and he understands them afar
off, [Psa 139:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#002.md). He could say to them
(which no mere man could), Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts? Note,
There is a great deal of evil in sinful thoughts, which is very
offensive to the Lord Jesus. He being the Sovereign of the heart, sinful
thoughts invade his right, and disturb his possession; therefore he
takes notice of them, and is much displeased with them. In them lies the
root of bitterness, [Gen 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#005.md). The sins
that begin and end in the heart, and go no further, are as dangerous as
any other.

2\. He argued them out of it, [Mat
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#005.md), [Mat
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#006.md). Where observe,

(1.) How he asserts his authority in the kingdom of grace. He undertakes
to make out, that the Son of man, the Mediator, has power on earth to
forgive sins; for therefore the Father has committed all judgment to the
Son, and has given him this authority, because he is the Son of man,
[Joh 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022.md), [Joh
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027.md). If he has power to give eternal
life, as he certainly has ([Joh 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#002).md),
he must have power to forgive sin; for guilt is a bar that must be
removed, or we can never get to heaven. What an encouragement is this to
poor sinners to repent, that the power of pardoning sin is put into the
hands of the Son of man, who is bone of our bone! And if he had this
power on earth, much more now that he is exalted to the Father's right
hand, to give repentance and remission of sins, and so to be both a
Prince and a Saviour, [Act 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#031.md).

(2.) How he proves it, by his power in the kingdom of nature; his power
to cure diseases. Is it not as easy to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee,
as to say, Arise and walk? He that can cure the disease, whether
declaratively as a Prophet, or authoritatively as God, can, in like
manner, forgive the sin. Now, \[1.\] This is a general argument to prove
that Christ had a divine mission. His miracles, especially his
miraculous cures, confirm what he said of himself, that he was the Son
of God; the power that appeared in his cures proved him sent of God; and
the pity that appeared in them proved him sent of God to heal and save.
The God of truth would not set his seal to a lie. \[2.\] It had a
particular cogency in this case. The palsy was but a symptom of the
disease of sin; now he made it to appear, that he could effectually cure
the original disease, by the immediate removal of that symptom; so close
a connection was there between the sin and the sickness. He that had
power to remove the punishment, no doubt, had power to remit the sin.
The scribes stood much upon a legal righteousness, and placed their
confidence in that, and made no great matter of the forgiveness of sin,
the doctrine upon which Christ hereby designed to put honour, and to
show that his great errand to the world was to save his people from
their sins.

V. The immediate cure of the sick man. Christ turned from disputing with
them, and spake healing to him. The most necessary arguings must not
divert us from doing the good that our hand finds to do. He saith to the
sick of the palsy, Arise, take up thy bed, and go to thine house; and a
healing, quickening, strengthening power accompanied this word ([Mat
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#007).md): he arose and departed to his
house. Now, 1. Christ bid him take up his bed, to show that he was
perfectly cured, and that not only he had no more occasion to be carried
upon his bed, but that he had strength to carry it. 2. He sent him to
his house, to be a blessing to his family, where he had been so long a
burden; and did not take him along with him for a show, which those
would do in such a case who seek the honour that comes from men.

VI\. The impression which this made upon the multitude ([Mat
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#008).md); they marvelled, and glorified
God. Note, All our wonder should help to enlarge our hearts in
glorifying God, who alone does marvellous things. They glorified God for
what he had done for this poor man. Note, Others' mercies should be our
praises, and we should give him thanks for them, for we are members one
of another. Though few of this multitude were so convinced, as to be
brought to believe in Christ, and to follow him, yet they admired him,
not as God, or the Son of God, but as a man to whom God had given such
power. Note, God must be glorified in all the power that is given to men
to do good. For all power is originally his; it is in him, as the
Fountain, in men, as the cisterns.

[Matthew 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 9:9</span></span>

In these verses we have an account of the grace and favour of Christ to
poor publicans, particularly to Matthew. What he did to the bodies of
people was to make way for a kind design upon their souls. Now observe
here,

I. The call of Matthew, the penman of this gospel. Mark and Luke call
him Levi; it was ordinary for the same person to have two names: perhaps
Matthew was the name he was most known by as a publican, and, therefore,
in his humility, he called himself by that name, rather than by the more
honourable name of Levi. Some think Christ gave him the name of Matthew
when he called him to be an apostle; as Simon, he surnamed Peter.
Matthew signifies, the gift of God, Ministers are God's gifts to the
church; their ministry, and their ability for it, are God's gifts to
them. Now observe,

1\. The posture that Christ's call found Matthew in. He was sitting at
the receipt of custom, for he was a publican, [Luk
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#027.md). He was a custom-house officer at
the port of Capernaum, or an exciseman, or collector of the land-tax.
Now, (1.) He was in his calling, as the rest of them whom Christ called,
[Mat 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018.md). Note, As Satan chooses to
come, with his temptations, to those that are idle, so Christ chooses to
come, with his calls, to those that are employed. But, (2.) It was a
calling of ill fame among serious people; because it was attended with
so much corruption and temptation, and there were so few in that
business that were honest men. Matthew himself owns what he was before
his conversion, as does St. Paul ([Ti1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#013).md), that the grace of Christ in
calling him might be the more magnified, and to show, that God has his
remnant among all sorts of people. None can justify themselves in their
unbelief, by their calling in the world; for there is no sinful calling,
but some have been saved out of it, and no lawful calling, but some have
been saved in it.

2\. The preventing power of this call. We find not that Matthew looked
after Christ, or had any inclination to follow him, though some of his
kindred were already disciples of Christ, but Christ prevented him with
the blessings of his goodness. He is found of those that seek him not.
Christ spoke first; we have not chosen him, but he hath chosen us. He
said, Follow me; and the same divine, almighty power accompanied this
word to convert Matthew, which attended that word ([Mat
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#006).md), Arise and walk, to cure the man
sick of the palsy. Note, A saving change is wrought in the soul by
Christ as the Author, and his word as the means. His gospel is the power
of God unto salvation, [Rom 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016.md). The
call was effectual, for he came at the call; he arose, and followed him
immediately; neither denied, nor deferred his obedience. The power of
divine grace soon answers and overcomes all objections. Neither his
commission for his place, nor his gains by it, could detain him, when
Christ called him. He conferred not with flesh and blood, [Gal
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015.md), [Gal
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#016.md). He quitted his post, and his
hopes of preferment in that way; and, though we find the disciples that
were fishers occasionally fishing again afterwards, we never find
Matthew at the receipt of custom again.

II\. Christ's converse with publicans and sinners upon this occasion;
Christ called Matthew, to introduce himself into an acquaintance with
the people of that profession. Jesus sat at meat in the house, [Mat
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#010.md). The other evangelists tell us,
that Matthew made a great feast, which the poor fishermen, when they
were called, were not able to do. But when he comes to speak of this
himself, he neither tells us that it was his own house, nor that it was
a feast, but only that he sat at meat in the house; preserving the
remembrance of Christ's favours to the publicans, rather than of the
respect he had paid to Christ. Note, It well becomes us to speak
sparingly of our own good deeds.

Now observe, 1. When Matthew invited Christ, he invited his disciples to
come along with him. Note, They that welcome Christ, must welcome all
that are his, for his sake, and let them have a room in their hearts. 2.
He invited many publicans and sinners to meet him. This was the chief
thing Matthew aimed at in this treat, that he might have an opportunity
of bringing his old associates acquainted with Christ. He knew by
experience what the grace of Christ could do, and would not despair
concerning them. Note, They who are effectually brought to Christ
themselves, cannot but be desirous that others also may be brought to
him, and ambitious of contributing something towards it. True grace will
not contentedly eat its morsels alone, but will invite others. When by
the conversion of Matthew the fraternity was broken, presently his house
was filled with publicans, and surely some of them will follow him, as
he followed Christ. Thus did Andrew and Philip, [Joh
1:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#041.md), [Joh
1:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#045.md); [Joh
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#029.md). See [Jdg
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#009.md).

III\. The displeasure of the Pharisees at this, [Mat
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#011.md). They cavilled at it; why eateth
your Master with publicans and sinners? Here observe, 1. That Christ was
quarrelled with. It was not the least of his sufferings, that he endured
the contradiction of sinners against himself. None was more quarrelled
with by men, than he that came to take up the great quarrel between God
and man. Thus he denied himself the honour due to an incarnate Deity,
which was to be justified in what he spake, and to have all he said
readily subscribed to: for though he never spoke or did anything amiss,
every thing he said and did was found fault with. Thus he taught us to
expect and prepare for reproach, and to bear it patiently. 2. They that
quarrelled with him were the Pharisees; a proud generation of men,
conceited of themselves, and censorious of others; of the same temper
with those in the prophet's time, who said, Stand by thyself, come not
near me; I am holier than thou: they were very strict in avoiding
sinners, but not in avoiding sin; none greater zealots than they for the
form of godliness, nor greater enemies to the power of it. They were for
keeping up the traditions of the elders to a nicety, and so propagating
the same spirit that they were themselves governed by. 3. They brought
their cavil, not to Christ himself; they had not the courage to face him
with it, but to his disciples. The disciples were in the same company,
but the quarrel is with the Master: for they would not have done it, if
he had not; and they thought it worse in him who was a prophet, than in
them; his dignity, they thought, should set him at a greater distance
from such company than others. Being offended at the Master, they
quarrel with the disciples. Note, It concerns Christians to be able to
vindicate and justify Christ, and his doctrines and laws, and to be
ready always to give an answer to those that ask them a reason of the
hope that is in them, [Pe1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#015.md). While
he is an Advocate for us in heaven, let us be advocates for him on
earth, and make his reproach our own. 4. The complaint was his eating
with publicans and sinners: to be intimate with wicked people is against
the law of God ([Psa 119:115](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#115.md); [Psa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001).md); and perhaps by accusing Christ
of this to his disciples, they hoped to tempt them from him, to put them
out of conceit with him, and so to bring them over to themselves to be
their disciples, who kept better company; for they compassed sea and
land to make proselytes. To be intimate with publicans was against the
tradition of the elders, and, therefore, they looked upon it as a
heinous thing. They were angry with Christ for this, (1.) Because they
wished ill to him, and sought occasion to misrepresent him. Note, It is
an easy and very common thing to put the worst constructions upon the
best words and actions. (2.) Because they wished no good to publicans
and sinners, but envied Christ's favour to them, and were grieved to see
them brought to repentance. Note, It may justly be suspected, that they
have not the grace of God themselves, who grudge others a share in that
grace, who are not pleased with it.

IV\. The defence that Christ made for himself and his disciples, in
justification of their converse with publicans and sinners. The
disciples, it should seem, being yet weak, had to seek for an answer to
the Pharisees' cavil, and, therefore, bring it to Christ, and he heard
it ([Mat 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#012).md), or perhaps overheard
them whispering it to his disciples. Let him alone to vindicate himself
and to plead his own cause, to answer for himself and for us too. Two
things he urges in his defence,

1\. The necessity and exigence of the case of the publicans, which
called aloud for his help, and therefore justified him in conversing
with them for their good. It was the extreme necessity of poor, lost
sinners, that brought Christ from the pure regions above, to these
impure ones; and the same was it, that brought him into this company
which was thought impure. Now,

(1.) He proves the necessity of the case of the publicans: they that be
whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. The publicans are
sick, and they need one to help and heal them, which the Pharisees think
they do not. Note,

\[1.\] Sin is the sickness of the soul; sinners are spiritually sick.
Original corruptions are the diseases of the soul, actual transgressions
are its wounds, or the eruptions of the disease. It is deforming,
weakening, disquieting, wasting, killing, but, blessed be God, not
incurable. \[2.\] Jesus Christ is the great Physician of souls. His
curing of bodily diseases signified this, that he arose with healing
under his wings. He is a skilful, faithful, compassionate Physician, and
it is his office and business to heal the sick. Wise and good men should
be as physicians to all about them; Christ was so. Hunc affectum versus
omnes habet sapiens, quem versus aegros suos medicus - A wise man
cherishes towards all around him the feelings of a physician for his
patient. Seneca De Const. \[3.\] Sin-sick souls have need of this
Physician, for their disease is dangerous; nature will not help itself;
no man can help us; such need have we of Christ, that we are undone,
eternally undone, without him. Sensible sinners see their need, and
apply themselves to him accordingly. \[4.\] There are multitudes who
fancy themselves to be sound and whole, who think they have no need of
Christ, but that they can shift for themselves well enough without him,
as Laodicea, [Rev 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#017.md). Thus the
Pharisees desired not the knowledge of Christ's word and ways, not
because they had no need of him, but because they thought they had none.
See [Joh 9:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#040.md), [Joh
9:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#041.md).

(2.) He proves, that their necessity did sufficiently justify his
conduct, in conversing familiarly with them, and that he ought not to be
blamed for it; for that necessity made it an act of charity, which ought
always to be preferred before the formalities of a religious profession,
in which beneficence and munificence are far better than magnificence,
as much as substance is better than shows or shadows. Those duties,
which are of moral and natural obligation, are to take place even of
those divine laws which are positive and ritual, much more of those
impositions of men, and traditions of the elders, which make God's law
stricter than he has made it. This he proves ([Mat
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#013).md) by a passage quoted out of [Hos
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006.md), I will have mercy and not
sacrifice. That morose separation from the society of publicans, which
the Pharisees enjoined, was less than sacrifice; but Christ's conversing
with them was more than an act of common mercy, and therefore to be
preferred before it. If to do well ourselves is better than sacrifice,
as Samuel shows ([Sa1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md), [Sa1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#023).md), much more to do good to
others. Christ's conversing with sinners is here called mercy: to
promote the conversion of souls is the greatest act of mercy imaginable;
it is saving a soul from death, [Jam
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#020.md). Observe how Christ quotes this,
Go ye and learn what that meaneth. Note, It is not enough to be
acquainted with the letter of scripture, but we must learn to understand
the meaning of it. And they have best learned the meaning of the
scriptures, that have learned how to apply them as a reproof to their
own faults, and a rule for their own practice. This scripture which
Christ quoted, served not only to vindicate him, but, \[1.\] To show
wherein true religion consists; not in external observances: not in
meats and drinks and shows of sanctity, not in little particular
opinions and doubtful disputations, but in doing all the good we can to
the bodies and souls of others; in righteousness and peace; in visiting
the fatherless and widows. \[2.\] To condemn the Pharisaical hypocrisy
of those who place religion in rituals, more than in morals, [Mat
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023.md). They espouse those forms of
godliness which may be made consistent with, and perhaps subservient to,
their pride, covetousness, ambition, and malice, while they hate that
power of it which is mortifying to those lusts.

2\. He urges the nature and end of his own commission. He must keep to
his orders, and prosecute that for which he was appointed to be the
great Teacher; now, says he, "I am not come to call the righteous, but
sinners to repentance, and therefore must converse with publicans."
Observe, (1.) What his errand was; it was to call to repentance. This
was his first text ([Mat 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#017).md), and it
was the tendency of all his sermons. Note, The gospel call is a call to
repentance; a call to us to change our mind and to change our way. (2.)
With whom his errand lay; not with the righteous, but with sinners. That
is, \[1.\] If the children of men had not been sinners, there had been
no occasion for Christ's coming among them. He is the Saviour, not of
man as man, but of man as fallen. Had the first Adam continued in his
original righteousness, we had not needed a second Adam. \[2.\]
Therefore his greatest business lies with the greatest sinners; the more
dangerous the sick man's case is, the more occasion there is for the
physician's help. Christ came into the world to save sinners, but
especially the chief ([Ti1 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015).md); to
call not those so much, who, though sinners, are comparatively
righteous, but the worst of sinners. \[3.\] The more sensible any
sinners are of their sinfulness, the more welcome will Christ and his
gospel be to them; and every one chooses to go where his company is
desired, not to those who would rather have his room. Christ came not
with an expectation of succeeding among the righteous, those who conceit
themselves so, and therefore will sooner be sick of their Saviour, than
sick of their sins, but among the convinced humble sinners; to them
Christ will come, for to them he will be welcome.

[Matthew 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 9:14</span></span>

The objections which were made against Christ and his disciples gave
occasion to some of the most profitable of his discourses; thus are the
interests of truth often served, even by the opposition it meets with
from gainsayers, and thus the wisdom of Christ brings good out of evil.
This is the third instance of it in this chapter; his discourse of his
power to forgive sin, and his readiness to receive sinners, was
occasioned by the cavils of the scribes and Pharisees; so here, from a
reflection upon the conduct of his family, arose a discourse concerning
his tenderness for it. Observe,

I. The objection which the disciples of John made against Christ's
disciples, for not fasting so often as they did; which they are charged
with, as another instance of the looseness of their profession, besides
that of eating with publicans and sinners; and it is therefore suggested
to them, that they should change that profession for another more
strict. It appears by the other evangelists ([Mar
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#018.md) and [Luk
5:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#033).md) that the disciples of the
Pharisees joined with them, and we have reason to suspect that they
instigated them, making use of John's disciples as their spokesmen,
because they, being more in favour with Christ and his disciples, could
do it more plausibly. Note, It is no new thing for bad men to set good
men together by the ears; if the people of God differ in their
sentiments, designing men will take that occasion to sow discord, and to
incense them one against another, and alienate them one from another,
and so make an easy prey of them. If the disciples of John and of Jesus
clash, we have reason to suspect the Pharisees have been at work
underhand, blowing the coals. Now the complaint is, Why do we and the
Pharisees fast often, but thy disciples fast not? It is pity the duties
of religion, which ought to be the confirmations of holy love, should be
made the occasions of strife and contention; but they often are so, as
here; where we may observe,

1\. How they boasted of their own fasting. We and the Pharisees fast
often. Fasting has in all ages of the church been consecrated, upon
special occasions, to the service of religion; the Pharisees were much
in it; many of them kept two fast-days in a week, and yet the generality
of them were hypocrites and bad men. Note, False and formal professors
often excel others in outward acts of devotion, and even of
mortification. The disciples of John fasted often, partly in compliance
with their master's practice, for he came neither eating nor drinking
([Mat 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#018).md); and people are apt to
imitate their leaders, though not always from the same inward principle;
partly in compliance with their master's doctrine of repentance. Note,
The severer part of religion is often most minded by those that are yet
under the discipline of the Spirit, as a Spirit of bondage, whereas,
though these are good in their place, we must pass through them to that
life of delight in God and dependence on him, to which these should
lead. Now they come to Christ to tell him that they fasted often, at
least they thought it often. Note, Most men will proclaim every one his
own goodness, [Pro 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#006.md). There is a
proneness in professors to brag of their own performance in religion,
especially if there by any thing extraordinary in them; nay, and not
only to boast of them before men, but to plead them before God, and
confide in them as a righteousness.

2\. How they blamed Christ's disciples for not fasting so often as they
did. Thy disciples fast not. They could not but know, that Christ had
instructed his disciples to keep their fasts private, and to manage
themselves so as that they might not appear unto men to fast; and,
therefore, it was very uncharitable in them to conclude they did not
fast, because they did not proclaim their fasts. Note, We must not judge
of people's religion by that which falls under the eye and observation
of the world. But suppose it was so, that Christ's disciples did not
fast so often or so long as they did, why truly, they would therefore
have it thought, that they had more religion in them than Christ's
disciples had. Note, It is common for vain professors to make themselves
a standard in religion, by which to try and measure persons and things,
as if all who differed from them were so far in the wrong; as if all
that did less than they, did too little, and all that did more than
they, did too much, which is a plain evidence of their want of humility
and charity.

3\. How they brought this complaint to Christ. Note, If Christ's
disciples, either by omission or commission, give offence, Christ
himself will be sure to hear of it, and be reflected upon for it. O,
Jesus, are these thy Christians? Therefore, as we tender the honour of
Christ, we are concerned to conduct ourselves well. Observe, The quarrel
with Christ was brought to the disciples ([Mat
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#011).md), the quarrel with the disciples
was brought to Christ ([Mat 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#014).md),
this is the way of sowing discord and killing love, to set people
against ministers, ministers against people, and one friend against
another.

II\. The apology which Christ made for his disciples in this matter.
Christ might have upbraided John's disciples with the former part of
their question, Why do ye fast often? "Nay, you know best why you do it;
but the truth is, many abound in external instances of devotion, that
scarcely do themselves know why and wherefore." But he only vindicates
the practice of his disciples; whey they had nothing to say for
themselves, he had something ready to say for them. Note, As it is
wisdom's honour to be justified of all her children, so it is her
children's happiness to be all justified of wisdom. What we do according
to the precept and pattern of Christ, he will be sure to bear us out in,
and we may with confidence leave it to him to clear up our integrity.

But thou shalt answer, Lord, for me.

\- Herbert

Two things Christ pleads in defence of their not fasting.

1\. That it was not a season proper for that duty ([Mat
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#015).md): Can the children of the
bride-chamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? Observe,
Christ's answer is so framed, as that it might sufficiently justify the
practice of his own disciples, and yet not condemn the institution of
John, or the practice of his disciples. When the Pharisees fomented this
dispute, they hoped Christ would cast blame, either on his own
disciples, or on John's, but he did neither. Note, When at any time we
are unjustly censured, our care must be only to clear ourselves, not to
recriminate, or throw dirt upon others; and such a variety may there be
of circumstances, as may justify us in our practice, without condemning
those that practise otherwise.

Now his argument is taken from the common usage of joy and rejoicing
during the continuance of marriage solemnities; when all instances of
melancholy and sorrow are looked upon as improper and absurd, as it was
at Samson's wedding, [Jdg 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#017.md). Now,
(1.) The disciples of Christ were the children of the bride-chamber,
invited to the wedding-feast, and welcome there; the disciples of the
Pharisees were not so, but children of the bond-woman ([Gal
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#025.md), [Gal
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#031).md), continuing under a dispensation
of darkness and terror. Note, The faithful followers of Christ, who have
the Spirit of adoption, have a continual feast, while they who have the
spirit of bondage and fear, cannot rejoice for joy, as other people,
[Hos 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#001). (2..md) The disciples of Christ
had the bridegroom with them, which the disciples of John had not; their
master was now cast into prison, and lay there in continual danger of
his life, and therefore it was seasonable for them to fast often. Such a
day would come upon the disciples of Christ, when the bridegroom should
be taken from them, when they should be deprived of his bodily presence,
and then should they fast. The thoughts of parting grieved them when he
was going, [Joh 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#006.md). Tribulation and
affliction befell them when he was gone, and gave them occasion of
mourning and praying, that is, of religious fasting. Note, \[1.\] Jesus
Christ is the Bridegroom of his Church, and his disciples are the
children of the bride-chamber. Christ speaks of himself to John's
disciples under this similitude, because that John had used it, when he
called himself a friend of the bridegroom, [Joh
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#029.md). And if they would by this hint
call to mind what their master then said, they would answer themselves.
\[2.\] The condition of those who are the children of the bride-chamber
is liable to many changes and alterations in this world; they sing of
mercy and judgment. \[3.\] It is merry or melancholy with the children
of the bride-chamber, according as they have more or less of the
bridegroom's presence. When he is with them, the candle of God shines
upon their head, and all is well; but when he is withdrawn, though but
for a small moment, they are troubled, and walk heavily; the presence
and nearness of the sun makes day and summer, his absence and distance,
night and winter. Christ is all in all to the church's joy. \[4.\] Every
duty is to be done in its proper season. See [Ecc
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#014.md); [Jam
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#013.md). There is a time to mourn and a
time to laugh, to each of which we should accommodate ourselves, and
bring forth fruit in due season. In fasts, regard is to be had to the
methods of God's grace towards us; when he mourns to us, we must lament;
and also to the dispensations of his providence concerning us; there are
times when the Lord God calls to weeping and mourning; regard is
likewise to be had to any special work before us, [Mat
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#021.md); [Act
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002.md).

2\. That they had not strength sufficient for that duty. This is set
forth in two similitudes, one of putting new cloth into an old garment,
which does but pull the old to pieces ([Mat
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#016).md); the other of putting new wine
into old bottles, which does but burst the bottles, [Mat
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#017.md). Christ's disciples were not able
to bear these severe exercises so well as those of John and of the
Pharisees, which the learned Dr. Whitby gives this reason for: There
were among the Jews not only sects of the Pharisees and Essenes, who led
an austere life, but also schools of the prophets, who frequently lived
in mountains and deserts, and were many of them Nazarites; they had also
private academies to train men up in a strict discipline; and possibly
from these many of John's disciples might come, and many of the
Pharisees; whereas Christ's disciples, being taken immediately from
their callings, had not been used to such religious austerities, and
were unfit for them, and would by them be rather unfitted for their
other work. Note, (1.) Some duties of religion are harder and more
difficult than others, like new cloth and new wine, which require most
intenseness of mind, and are most displeasing to flesh and blood; such
are religious fasting and the duties that attend it. (2.) The best of
Christ's disciples pass through a state of infancy; all the trees in
Christ's garden are not of a growth, nor all his scholars in the same
form; there are babes in Christ and grown men. (3.) In the enjoining of
religious exercises, the weakness and infirmity of young Christians
ought to be considered: as the food provided for them must be such as is
proper for their age ([Co1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#002.md); [Heb
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012).md), so must the work be that is cut
out for them. Christ would not speak to his disciples that which they
could not then bear, [Joh 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#012.md). Young
beginners in religion must not be put upon the hardest duties at first,
lest they be discouraged. Such as was God's care of his Israel, when he
brought them out of Egypt, not to lead them by the way of the
Philistines ([Exo 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#017.md), [Exo
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#018).md), and such as was Jacob's care
of his children and cattle, not to overdrive them ([Gen
33:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#013).md), such is Christ's care of the
little ones of his family, and the lambs of his flock: he gently leads
them. For want of this care, many times, the bottles break, and the wine
is spilled; the profession of many miscarries and comes to nothing,
through indiscretion at first. Note, There may be over-doing even in
well-doing, a being righteous over-much; and such an over-doing as may
prove an undoing through the subtlety of Satan.

[Matthew 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 9:18</span></span>

We have here two passages of history put together; that of the raising
of Jairus's daughter to life, and that of the curing of the woman that
had the bloody issue, as he was going to Jairus's house, which is
introduced in a parenthesis, in the midst of the other; for Christ's
miracles were thick sown, and interwoven; the work of him that sent him
was his daily work. He was called to do these good works from speaking
the things foregoing, in answer to the cavils of the Pharisees, [Mat
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#018.md) : While he spake these things;
and we may suppose it is a pleasing interruption given to that
unpleasant work of disputation, which, though sometimes needful, a good
man will gladly leave, to go about a work of devotion or charity. Here
is,

I. The ruler's address to Christ, [Mat
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#018.md). A certain ruler, a ruler of the
synagogue, came and worshipped him. Have any of the rulers believed on
him? Yes, here was one, a church ruler, whose faith condemned the
unbelief of the rest of the rulers. This ruler had a little daughter, of
twelve years old, just dead, and this breach made upon his family
comforts was the occasion of his coming to Christ. Note, In trouble we
should visit God: the death of our relations should drive us to Christ,
who is our life; it is well if any thing will do it. When affliction is
in our families, we must not sit down astonished, but, as Job, fall down
and worship. Now observe,

1\. His humility in this address to Christ. He came with his errand to
Christ himself, and did not send his servant. Note, It is no
disparagement to the greatest rulers, personally to attend on the Lord
Jesus. He worshipped him, bowed the knee to him, and gave him all
imaginable respect. Note, They that would receive mercy from Christ must
give honour to Christ.

2\. His faith in this address; "My daughter is even now dead," and
though any other physician would now come too late (nothing more absurd
than post mortem medicina - medicine after death), yet Christ comes not
too late; he is a Physician after death, for he is the resurrection and
the life; "O come then, and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live."
This was quite above the power of nature (a privatione ad habitum non
datur regressus - life once lost cannot be restored), yet within the
power of Christ, who has life in himself, and quickeneth whom he will.
Now Christ works in an ordinary, by nature and not against it, and,
therefore, we cannot in faith bring him such a request as this; while
there is life, there is hope, and room for prayer; but when our friends
are dead, the case is determined; we shall go to them, but they shall
not return to us. But while Christ was here upon earth working miracles,
such a confidence as this was not only allowable but very commendable.

II\. The readiness of Christ to comply with his address, [Mat
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#019.md). Jesus immediately arose, left
his company, and followed him; he was not only willing to grant him what
he desired, in raising his daughter to life, but to gratify him so far
as to come to his house to do it. Surely he never said to the seed of
Jacob, Seek ye me in vain. He denied to go along with the nobleman, who
said, Sir, come down, ere my child die ([Joh
4:48-50](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#048).md), yet he went along with the
ruler of the synagogue, who said, Sir, come down, and my child shall
live. The variety of methods which Christ took in working his miracles
is perhaps to be attributed to the different frame and temper of mind
which they were in who applied to him, which he who searcheth the heart
perfectly knew, and accommodated himself to. He knows what is in man,
and what course to take with him. And observe, when Jesus followed him,
so did his disciples, whom he had chosen for his constant companions; it
was not for state, or that he might come with observation, that he took
his attendants with him, but that they might be the witnesses of his
miracles, who were hereafter to be the preachers of his doctrine.

III\. The healing of the poor woman's bloody issue. I call her a poor
woman, not only because her case was piteous, but because, she had spent
it all upon physicians, for the cure of her distemper, and was never the
better; which was a double aggravation of the misery of her condition,
that she had been full, but was now empty; and that she had impoverished
herself for the recovery of her health, and yet had not her health
neither. This woman was diseased with a constant issue of blood twelve
years ([Mat 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#020).md); a disease, which
was not only weakening and wasting, and under which the body must needs
languish; but which also rendered her ceremonially unclean, and shut her
out from the courts of the Lord's house; but it did not cut her off from
approaching to Christ. She applied herself to Christ, and received mercy
from him, by the way, as he followed the ruler, whose daughter was dead,
to whom it would be a great encouragement, and a help to keep up his
faith in the power of Christ. So graciously does Christ consider the
frame, and consult the case, of weak believers. Observe,

1\. The woman's great faith in Christ, and in his power. Her disease was
of such a nature, that her modesty would not suffer her to speak openly
to Christ for a cure, as others did, but by a peculiar impulse of the
Spirit of faith, she believed him to have such an overflowing fulness of
healing virtue, that the very touch of his garment would be her cure.
This, perhaps, had something of fancy mixed with faith; for she had no
precedent for this way of application to Christ, unless, as some think,
she had an eye to the raising of the dead man by the touch of Elisha's
bones, [Kg2 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#021.md). But what weakness
of understanding there was in it, Christ was pleased to overlook, and to
accept the sincerity and strength of her faith; for he eateth the
honey-comb with the honey, [Sol 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#011.md).
She believed she should be healed if she did but touch the very hem of
his garment, the very extremity of it. Note, There is virtue in every
thing that belongs to Christ. The holy oil with which the high priest
was anointed, ran down to the skirts of his garments, [Psa
133:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#002.md). Such a fulness of grace is
there in Christ, that from it we may all receive, [Joh
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016.md).

2\. Christ's great favour to this woman. He did not suspend (as he might
have done) his healing influences, but suffered this bashful patient to
steal a cure unknown to any one else, though she could not think to do
it unknown to him. And now she was well content to be gone, for she had
what she came for, but Christ was not willing to let he to so; he will
not only have his power magnified in her cure, but his grace magnified
in her comfort and commendation: the triumphs of her faith must be to
her praise and honour. He turned about to see for her ([Mat
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#022).md), and soon discovered her. Note,
It is great encouragement to humble Christians, that they who hide
themselves from men are known to Christ, who sees in secret their
applications to heaven when most private. Now here,

(1.) He puts gladness into her heart, by that word, Daughter, be of good
comfort. She feared being chidden for coming clandestinely, but she is
encouraged. \[1.\] He calls her daughter, for he spoke to her with the
tenderness of a father, as he did to the man sick of the palsy ([Mat
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002).md), whom he called son. Note, Christ
has comforts ready for the daughters of Zion, that are of a sorrowful
spirit, as Hannah was, [Sa1 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#015.md).
Believing women are Christ's daughters, and he will own them as such.
\[2.\] He bids her be of good comfort: she has reason to be so, if
Christ own her for a daughter. Note, The saints' consolation is founded
in their adoption. His bidding her be comforted, brought comfort with
it, as his saying, Be ye whole, brought health with it. Note, It is the
will of Christ that his people should be comforted, and it is his
prerogative to command comfort to troubled spirits. He creates the fruit
of the lips, peace, [Isa 57:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019.md).

(2.) He puts honour upon her faith. That grace of all others gives most
honour to Christ, and therefore he puts most honour upon it; Thy faith
has made thee whole. Thus by faith she obtained a good report. And as of
all graces Christ puts the greatest honour upon faith, so of all
believers he puts the greatest honour upon those that are most humble;
as here on this woman, who had more faith than she thought she had. She
had reason to be of good comfort, not only because she was made whole,
but because her faith had made her whole; that is, \[1.\] She was
spiritually healed; that cure was wrought in her which is the proper
fruit and effect of faith, the pardon of sin and the work of grace.
Note, We may then be abundantly comforted in our temporal mercies when
they are accompanied with those spiritual blessings that resemble them;
our food and raiment will be comfortable, when by faith we are fed with
the bread of life, and clothed with the righteousness of Jesus Christ;
our rest and sleep will be comfortable, when by faith we repose in God,
and dwell at ease in him; our health and prosperity will be comfortable,
when by faith our souls prosper, and are in health. See [Isa
38:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#016.md), [Isa
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#017.md). \[2.\] Her bodily cure was the
fruit of faith, of her faith, and that made it a happy, comfortable cure
indeed. They out of whom the devils were cast, were helped by Christ's
sovereign power; some by the faith of others (as [Mat
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002).md); but it is thy faith that has
made thee whole. Note, Temporal mercies are then comforts indeed to us,
when they are received by faith. If, when in pursuit of mercy, we prayed
for it in faith, with an eye to the promise, and in dependence upon
that, if we desired it for the sake of God's glory, and with a
resignation to God's will, and have our hearts enlarged by it in faith,
love, and obedience, we may then say, it was received by faith.

IV\. The posture in which he found the ruler's house, [Mat
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#023.md). - He saw the people and the
minstrels, or musicians, making a noise. The house was in a hurry: such
work does death make, when it comes into a family; and, perhaps, the
necessary cares that arise at such a time, when our dead is to be
decently buried out of our sight, give some useful diversion to that
grief which is apt to prevail and play the tyrant. The people in the
neighbourhood came together to condole on account of the loss, to
comfort the parents, to prepare for, and attend on, the funeral, which
the Jews were not wont to defer long. The musicians were among them,
according to the custom of the Gentiles, with their doleful, melancholy
tunes, to increase the grief, and stir up the lamentations of those that
attended on this occasion; as (they say) is usual among the Irish, with
their Ahone, Ahone. Thus they indulged a passion that is apt enough of
itself to grow intemperate, and affected to sorrow as those that had no
hope. See how religion provides cordials, where irreligion administers
corrosives. Heathenism aggravates that grief which Christianity studies
to assuage. Or perhaps these musicians endeavoured on the other hand to
divert the grief and exhilarate the family; but, as vinegar upon nitre,
so is he that sings songs to a heavy heart. Observe, The parents, who
were immediately touched with the affliction, were silent, while the
people and minstrels, whose lamentations were forced, made such a noise.
Note, The loudest grief is not always the greatest; rivers are most
noisy where they run shallow. Ille dolet vere, qui sine teste dolet -
That grief is most sincere, which shuns observation. But notice is taken
of this, to show that the girl was really dead, in the undoubted
apprehension of all about her.

V. The rebuke that Christ gave to this hurry and noise, [Mat
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#024.md). He said, Give place. Note,
Sometimes, when the sorrow of the world prevails, it is difficult for
Christ and his comforts to enter. They that harden themselves in sorrow,
and, like Rachel, refuse to be comforted, should think they hear Christ
saying to their disquieting thoughts, Give place: "Make room for him who
is the Consolation of Israel, and brings with him strong consolations,
strong enough to overcome the confusion and tyranny of these worldly
griefs, if he may but be admitted into the soul." He gives a good reason
why they should not thus disquiet themselves and one another; The maid
is not dead but sleepeth. 1. This was eminently true of this maid, that
was immediately to be raised to life; she was really dead, but not so to
Christ, who knew within himself what he would do, and could do, and who
had determined to make her death but as a sleep. There is little more
difference between sleep and death, but in continuance; whatever other
difference there is, it is but a dream. This death must be but of short
continuance, and therefore is but a sleep, like one night's rest. He
that quickens the dead, may well call the things which be not as though
they were, [Rom 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#017.md). 2. It is in a
sense true of all that die, chiefly of them that die in the Lord. Note,
(1.) Death is a sleep. All nations and languages, for the softening of
that which is so dreadful, and withal so unavoidable, and the
reconciling of themselves to it, have agreed to call it so. It is said,
even of the wicked kings, that they slept with their fathers; and of
those that shall arise to everlasting contempt, that they sleep in the
dust, [Dan 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md). It is not the sleep
of the soul; its activity ceases not; but the sleep of the body, which
lies down in the grave, still and silent, regardless and disregarded,
wrapt up in darkness and obscurity. Sleep is a short death, and death a
long sleep. But the death of the righteous is in a special manner to be
looked upon as a sleep, [Isa 57:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#002.md).
They sleep in Jesus ([Th1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014).md); they
not only rest from the toils and labours of the day, but rest in hope of
a joyful waking again in the morning of the resurrection, when they
shall wake refreshed, wake to a new life, wake to be richly dressed and
crowned, and wake to sleep no more. (2.) The consideration of this
should moderate our grief at the death of our dear relations: "say not,
They are lost; no, they are but gone before: say not, They are slain;
no, they are but fallen asleep; and the apostle speaks of it as an
absurd thing to imagine that they that are fallen asleep in Christ are
perished ([Co1 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#018).md); give place,
therefore, to those comforts which the covenant of grace ministers,
fetched from the future state, and the glory to be revealed."

Now could it be thought that such a comfortable word as this, from the
mouth of our Lord Jesus, should be ridiculed as it was? They laughed him
to scorn. These people lived in Capernaum, knew Christ's character, that
he never spake a rash or foolish word; they knew how many mighty works
he had done; so that if they did not understand what he meant by this,
they might at least have been silent in expectation of the issue. Note,
The words and works of Christ which cannot be understood, yet are not
therefore to be despised. We must adore the mystery of divine sayings,
even when they seem to contradict what we think ourselves most confident
of. Yet even this tended to the confirmation of the miracle: for it
seems she was so apparently dead, that it was thought a very ridiculous
thing to say otherwise.

VI\. The raising of the damsel to life by the power of Christ, [Mat
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#025.md). The people were put forth. Note,
Scorners that laugh at what they see and hear that is above their
capacity, are not proper witnesses of the wonderful works of Christ, the
glory of which lies not in pomp, but in power. The widow's son at Nain,
and Lazarus, were raised from the dead openly, but this damsel
privately; for Capernaum, that had slighted the lesser miracles of
restoring health, was unworthy to see the greater, of restoring life;
these pearls were not to be cast before those that would trample them
under their feet.

Christ went in and took her by the hand, as it were to awake her, and to
help her up, prosecuting his own metaphor of her being asleep. The high
priest, that typified Christ, was not to come near the dead ([Lev
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#010.md), [Lev
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#011).md), but Christ touched the dead.
The Levitical priesthood leaves the dead in their uncleanness, and
therefore keeps at a distance from them, because it cannot remedy them;
but Christ, having power to raise the dead, is above the infection, and
therefore is not shy of touching them. He took her by the hand, and the
maid arose. So easily, so effectually was the miracle wrought; not by
prayer, as Elijah did ([Kg1 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#021).md),
and Elisha ([Kg2 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#033).md), but by a
touch. They did it as servants, he as a Son, as a God, to whom belong
the issues from death. Note, Jesus Christ is the Lord of souls, he
commands them forth, and commands them back, when and as he pleases.
Dead souls are not raised to spiritual life, unless Christ take them by
the hand: it is done in the day of his power. He helps us up, or we lie
still.

VII\. The general notice that was taken of this miracle, though it was
wrought privately; [Mat 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#026.md). The fame
thereof went abroad into all that land: it was the common subject of
discourse. Note, Christ's works are more talked of than considered and
improved. And doubtless, they that heard only the report of Christ's
miracles, were accountable for that as well as they that were
eye-witnesses of them. Though we at this distance have not seen Christ's
miracles, yet having an authentic history of them, we are bound, upon
the credit of that, to receive his doctrine; and blessed are they that
have not seen, and yet have believed, [Joh
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#029.md).

[Matthew 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 9:27</span></span>

In these verses we have an account of two more miracles wrought together
by our Saviour.

I. The giving of sight to two blind men, [Mat
9:27-31](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#027.md). Christ is the Fountain of
light as well as life; and as, by raising the dead, he showed himself to
be the same that at first breathed into man the breath of life, so, by
giving sight to the blind, he showed himself to be the same that at
first commanded the light to shine out of darkness. Observe,

1\. The importunate address of the blind men to Christ. He was returning
from the ruler's house to his own lodgings, and these blind men followed
him, as beggars do, with their incessant cries, [Mat
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#027.md). He that cured diseases so
easily, so effectually, and, withal, at so cheap a rate, shall have
patients enough. As for other things, so he is famed for an Oculist.
Observe,

(1.) The title which these blind men gave to Christ; Thou Son of David,
have mercy on us. The promise made to David, that of his loins the
Messiah should come, was well known, and the Messiah was therefore
commonly called the Son of David. At this time there was a general
expectation of his appearing; these blind men know, and own, and
proclaim it in the streets of Capernaum, that he is come, and that this
is he; which aggravates the folly and sin of the chief priests and
Pharisees who denied and opposed him. They could not see him and his
miracles, but faith comes by hearing. Note, They who, by the providence
of God, are deprived of bodily sight, may yet, by the grace of God, have
the eyes of their understanding so enlightened, as to discern those
great things of God, which are hid from the wise and prudent.

(2.) Their petition, Have mercy on us. It was foretold that the Son of
David should be merciful ([Psa 72:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#012.md),
[Psa 72:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#013).md), and in him shines the
tender mercy of our God, [Luk 1:78](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#078.md).
Note, Whatever our necessities and burthens are, we need no more for
supply and support, than a share in the mercy of our Lord Jesus. Whether
he heal us or no, if he have mercy on us, we have enough; as to the
particular instances and methods of mercy, we may safely and wisely
refer ourselves to the wisdom of Christ. They did not each of them say
for himself, Have mercy on me, but both for one another, Have mercy on
us. Note, It becomes those that are under the same affliction, to concur
in the same prayers for relief. Fellow-sufferers should be
joint-petitioners. In Christ there is enough for all.

(3.) Their importunity in this request; they followed him, crying. It
seems, he did not take notice of them at first, for he would try their
faith, which he knew to be strong; would quicken their prayers, and make
his cures the more valued, when they did not always come at the first
word; and would teach us to continue instant in prayer, always to pray,
and not to faint: and, though the answer do not come presently, yet to
wait for it, and to follow providence, even in those steps and outgoings
of it which seem to neglect or contradict our prayers. Christ would not
heal them publicly in the streets, for this was a cure he would have
kept private ([Mat 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#030).md), but when he
came into the house, they followed him thither, and came to him. Note,
Christ's doors are always open to believing and importunate petitioners;
it seemed rude in them to rush into the house after him, when he desired
to retire; but, such is the tenderness of our Lord Jesus, that they were
not more bold than welcome.

2\. The confession of faith, which Christ drew from them upon this
occasion. When they came to him for mercy, he asked them, Believe ye
that I am able to do this? Note, Faith is the great condition of
Christ's favours. They who would receive the mercy of Christ, must
firmly believe the power of Christ. What we would have him do for us, we
must be fully assured that he is able to do. They followed Christ, and
followed him crying, but the great question is, Do ye believe? Nature
may work fervency, but it is only grace that can work faith; spiritual
blessings are obtained only by faith. They had intimated their faith in
the office of Christ as Son of David, and in his mercy; but Christ
demands likewise a profession of faith in his power. Believe ye that I
am able to do this; to bestow this favour; to give sight to the blind,
as well as to cure the palsy and raise the dead? Note, It is good to be
particular in the exercise of faith, to apply the general assurances of
God's power and good will, and the general promises, to our particular
exigencies. All shall work for good, and if all, then this. "Believe ye
that I am able, not only to prevail with God for it, as a prophet, but
that I am able to do it by my own power?" This will amount to their
belief of his being not only the Son of David, but the Son of God; for
it is God's prerogative to open the eyes of the blind ([Psa
146:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#008).md); he makes the seeing eye, [Exo
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#011.md). Job was eyes to the blind ([Job
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#015).md); was to them instead of eyes,
but he could not give eyes to the blind. Still it is put to us, Believe
we that Christ is able to do for us, by the power of his merit and
intercession in heaven, of his Spirit and grace in the heart, and of his
providence and dominion in the world? To believe the power of Christ is
not only to assure ourselves of it, but to commit ourselves to it, and
encourage ourselves in it.

To this question they give an immediate answer, without hesitation: they
said, Yea, Lord. Though he had kept them in suspense awhile, and had not
helped them at first, they honestly imputed that to his wisdom, not to
his weakness, and were still confident of his ability. Note, The
treasures of mercy that are laid up in the power of Christ, are laid out
and wrought for those that trust in him, [Psa
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#019.md).

3\. The cure that Christ wrought on them; he touched their eyes, [Mat
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#029.md). This he did to encourage their
faith, which, by his delay, he had tried, and to show that he gives
sight to blind souls by the operations of his grace accompanying the
word, anointing the eyes with eye-salve: and he put the cure upon their
faith, According to your faith be it unto you. When they begged for a
cure, he enquired into their faith ([Mat
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#028).md), Believe ye that I am able? He
did not enquire into their wealth, whether they were able to pay him for
a cure; nor into their reputation, should he get credit by curing them;
but into their faith; and now they had professed their faith he referred
the matter to that: "I know you do believe, and the power you believe in
shall be exerted for you; According to your faith be it unto you." This
speaks, (1.) His knowledge of the sincerity of their faith, and his
acceptance and approbation of it. Note, It is a great comfort to true
believers, that Jesus Christ knows their faith, and is well pleased with
it. Though it be weak, though others do not discern it, though they
themselves are ready to question it, it is known to him. (2.) His
insisting upon their faith as necessary; "If you believe, take what you
come for." Note, They who apply themselves to Jesus Christ, shall be
dealt with according to their faith; not according to their fancies, nor
according to their profession, but according to their faith; that is,
unbelievers cannot expect to find any favour with God, but true
believers may be sure to find all that favour which is offered in the
gospel; and our comforts ebb or flow, according as our faith is stronger
or weaker; we are not straitened in Christ, let us not then be
straitened in ourselves.

4\. The charge he gave them to keep it private ([Mat
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#030).md), See that no man know it. He
gave them this charge, (1.) To set us an example of that humility and
lowliness of mind, which he would have us to learn of him. Note, In the
good we do, we must not seek our own praise, but only the glory of God.
It must be more our care and endeavour to be useful, than to be known
and observed to be so, [Pro 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#006.md); [Pro
25:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#027.md). Thus Christ seconded the rule
he had given, Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth. (2.)
Some think that Christ, in keeping it private, showed his displeasure
against the people of Capernaum, who had seen so many miracles, and yet
believed not. Note, The silencing of those who should proclaim the works
of Christ is a judgment to any place or people: and it is just in Christ
to deny the means of conviction to those that are obstinate in their
infidelity; and to shroud the light from those that shut their eyes
against it. (3.) He did it in discretion, for his own preservation;
because the more he was proclaimed, the more jealous would the rulers of
the Jews be of his growing interest among the people. (4.) Dr. Whitby
gives another reason, which is very considerable, why Christ sometimes
concealed his miracles, and afterwards forbid the publishing of his
transfiguration; because he would not indulge that pernicious conceit
which obtained among the Jews, that their Messiah should be a temporal
prince, and so give occasion to the people to attempt the setting up of
his kingdom, by tumults and seditions, as they offered to do, [Joh
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#015.md). But when, after his resurrection
(which was the full proof of his mission), his spiritual kingdom was set
up, then that danger was over, and they must be published to all
nations. And he observes, that the miracles which Christ wrought among
the Gentiles and the Gadarenes, were ordered to be published, because
with them there was not that danger.

But honour is like the shadow, which, as it flees from those that follow
it, so it follows those that flee from it ([Mat
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#031).md); They spread abroad his fame.
This was more an act of zeal, than of prudence; and though it may be
excused as honestly meant for the honour of Christ, yet it cannot be
justified, being done against a particular charge. Whenever we profess
to direct our intention to the glory of God, we must see to it that the
action be according to the will of God.

II\. The healing of a dumb man, that was possessed with a devil. And
here observe,

1\. His case, which was very sad. He was under the power of the devil in
this particular instance, that he was disabled from speaking, [Mat
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#032.md). See the calamitous state of this
world, and how various the afflictions of the afflicted are! We have no
sooner dismissed two blind men, but we meet with a dumb man. How
thankful should we be to God for our sight and speech! See the malice of
Satan against mankind, and in how many ways he shows it. This man's
dumbness was the effect of his being possessed with a devil; but it was
better he should be unable to say any thing, than be forced to say, as
those demoniacs did ([Mat 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#029).md), What
have we to do with thee? Of the two, better a dumb devil than a
blaspheming one. When the devil gets possession of a soul, it is made
silent as to any thing that is good; dumb in prayers and praises, which
the devil is a sworn enemy to. This poor creature they brought to
Christ, who entertained not only those that came of themselves in their
own faith, but those that were brought to him by their friends in the
faith of others. Though the just shall live eternally by his faith, yet
temporal mercies may be bestowed on us with an eye to their faith who
are intercessors on our behalf. They brought him in just as the blind
man went out. See how unwearied Christ was in doing good; how closely
one good work followed another! Treasures of mercy, wondrous mercy, are
hid in him; which may be continually communicated, but can never be
exhausted.

2\. His cure, which was very sudden ([Mat
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#033).md), When the devil was cast out,
the dumb spake. Note, Christ's cures strike at the root, and remove the
effect by taking away the cause; they open the lips, by breaking Satan's
power in the soul. In sanctification he heals the waters by casting salt
into the spring. When Christ, by his grace, casts the devil out of a
soul, presently the dumb speaks. When Paul was converted, behold, he
prays; then the dumb spake.

3\. The consequences of this cure.

(1.) The multitudes marvelled; and well they might; though few believed,
many wondered. The admiration of the common people is sooner raised than
any other affection. It was foretold, that the new song, the New
Testament song, should be sung for marvellous works, [Psa
98:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001.md). They said, It was never so seen
in Israel, and therefore never so seen any where; for no people
experienced such wonders of mercy as Israel did. There had been those in
Israel that were famous for working miracles, but Christ excelled them
all. The miracles Moses wrought had reference to Israel as a people, but
Christ's were brought home to particular persons.

(2.) The Pharisees blasphemed, [Mat
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#034.md). When they could not gainsay the
convincing evidence of these miracles, they fathered them upon the
devil, as if they had been wrought by compact and collusion: he casteth
out devils (say they) by the prince of the devils - a suggestion horrid
beyond expression; we shall hear more of it afterwards, and Christ's
answer to it ([Mat 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#025).md); only
observe here, how evil men and seducers wax worse and worse ([Ti2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#013).md), and it is both their sin and
their punishment. Their quarrels with Christ for taking upon him to
forgive sin ([Mat 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#003).md), for conversing
with publicans and sinners, ([Mat
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#011).md), for not fasting ([Mat
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#014).md), though spiteful enough, yet had
some colour of piety, purity, and devotion in them; but this (which they
are left to, to punish them for those) breathes nothing but malice and
falsehood, and hellish enmity in the highest degree; it is diabolism all
over, and was therefore justly pronounced unpardonable. Because the
people marvelled, they must say something to diminish the miracle, and
this was all they could say.

[Matthew 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mat 9:35</span></span>

Here is, I. A conclusion of the foregoing account of Christ's preaching
and miracles ([Mat 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#035).md); He went
about all the cities teaching and healing. This is the same we had
before, [Mat 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#023.md). There it ushers in
the more particular record of Christ's preaching (ch. 5, 6 and 7) and of
his cures (ch. 8 and 9), and here it is elegantly repeated in the close
of these instances, as the quod erat demonstrandum - the point to be
proved; as if the evangelist should say, "Now I hope I have made it out,
by an induction of particulars, that Christ preached and healed; for you
have had the heads of his sermons, and some few instances of his cures,
which were wrought to confirm his doctrine: and these were written that
you might believe." Some think that this was a second perambulation in
Galilee, like the former; he visited again those whom he had before
preached to. Though the Pharisees cavilled at him and opposed him, he
went on with his work; he preached the gospel of the kingdom. He told
them of a kingdom of grace and glory, now to be set up under the
government of a Mediator: this was gospel indeed, good news, glad
tidings of great joy.

Observe how Christ in his preaching had respect,

1\. To the private towns. He visited not only the great and wealthy
cities, but the poor, obscure villages; there he preached, there he
healed. The souls of those that are meanest in the world are as precious
to Christ, and should be to us, as the souls of those that make the
greatest figure. Rich and poor meet together in him, citizens and boors:
his righteous acts towards the inhabitants of his villages must be
rehearsed, [Jdg 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#011.md).

2\. To the public worship. He taught in their synagogues, (1.) That he
might bear a testimony to solemn assemblies, even then when there were
corruptions in them. We must not forsake the assembling of ourselves
together, as the manner of some is. (2.) That he might have an
opportunity of preaching there, where people were gathered together,
with an expectation to hear. Thus, even where the gospel church was
founded, and Christian meetings erected, the apostles often preached in
the synagogues of the Jews. It is the wisdom of the prudent, to make the
best of that which is.

II\. A preface, or introduction, to the account in the following
chapter, of his sending forth his apostles. He took notice of the
multitude ([Mat 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#036).md); not only of the
crowds that followed him, but of the vast numbers of people with whom
(as he passed along) he observed the country to be replenished; he
noticed what nests of souls the towns and cities were, and how thick of
inhabitants; what abundance of people there were in every synagogue, and
what places of concourse the openings of the gates were: so very
populous was that nation now grown; and it was the effect of God's
blessing on Abraham. Seeing this,

1\. He pities them, and was concerned for them ([Mat
9:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#036).md); He was moved with compassion on
them; not upon a temporal account, as he pities the blind, and lame, and
sick; but upon a spiritual account; he was concerned to see them
ignorant and careless, and ready to perish for lack of vision. Note,
Jesus Christ is a very compassionate friend to precious souls; here his
bowels do in a special manner yearn. It was pity to souls that brought
him from heaven to earth, and there to the cross. Misery is the object
of mercy; and the miseries of sinful, self-destroying souls, are the
greatest miseries: Christ pities those most that pity themselves least;
so should we. The most Christian compassion is compassion to souls; it
is most Christ-like.

See what moved this pity. (1.) They fainted; they were destitute, vexed,
wearied. They strayed, so some; were loosed one from another; The staff
of bands was broken, [Zac 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#014.md). They
wanted help for their souls, and had none at hand that was good for any
thing. The scribes and Pharisees filled them with vain notions,
burthened them with the traditions of the elders, deluded them into many
mistakes, while they were not instructed in their duty, nor acquainted
with the extent and spiritual nature of the divine law; therefore they
fainted; for what spiritual health, and life, and vigour can there be in
those souls, that are fed with husks and ashes, instead of the bread of
life? Precious souls faint when duty is to be done, temptations to be
resisted, afflictions to be borne, being not nourished up with the word
of truth. (2.) They were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.
That expression is borrowed from [Kg1
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#017.md), and it sets forth the sad
condition of those that are destitute of faithful guides to go before
them in the things of God. No creature is more apt to go astray than a
sheep, and when gone astray more helpless, shiftless, and exposed, or
more unapt to find the way home again: sinful souls are as lost sheep;
they need the care of shepherds to bring them back. The teachers the
Jews then had pretended to be shepherds, yet Christ says they had not
shepherds, for they were worse than none; idle shepherds that led them
away, instead of leading them back, and fleeced the flock, instead of
feeding it: such shepherds as were described, [Jer
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001.md), etc. [Eze
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#002.md), etc. Note, The case of those
people is very pitiable, who either have no ministers at all, or those
that are as bad as none; that seek their own things, not the things of
Christ and souls.

2\. He excited his disciples to pray for them. His pity put him upon
devising means for the good of these people. It appears ([Luk
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#012.md), [Luk
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#013).md) that upon this occasion, before
he sent out his apostles, he did himself spend a great deal of time in
prayer. Note, Those we pity we should pray for. Having spoken to God for
them he turns to his disciples, and tells them,

(1.) How the case stood; The harvest truly is plenteous, but the
labourers are few. People desired good preaching, but there were few
good preachers. There was a great deal of work to be done, and a great
deal of good likely to be done, but there wanted hands to do it. \[1.\]
It was an encouragement, that the harvest was so plenteous. It was not
strange, that there were multitudes that needed instruction, but it was
what does not often happen, that they who needed it, desired it, and
were forward to receive it. They that were ill taught were desirous to
be better taught; people's expectations were raised, and there was such
a moving of affections, as promised well. Note, It is a blessed thing,
to see people in love with good preaching. The valleys are then covered
over with corn, and there are hopes it may be well gathered in. That is
a gale of opportunity, that calls for a double care and diligence in the
improvement of it; a harvest-day should be a busy day. \[2.\] It was a
pity when it was so that the labourers should be so few; that the corn
should shed and spoil, and rot upon the ground for want of reapers;
loiterers many, but labourers very few. Note, It is ill with the church,
when good work stands still, or goes slowly on, for want of good
workmen; when it is so, the labourers that there are have need to be
very busy.

(2.) What was their duty in this case ([Mat
9:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#038).md); Pray ye therefore the Lord of
the harvest. Note, The melancholy aspect of the times and the deplorable
state of precious souls, should much excite and quicken prayer. When
things look discouraging, we should pray more, and then we should
complain and fear less. And we should adapt our prayers to the present
exigencies of the church; such an understanding we ought to have of the
times, as to know, not only what Israel ought to do, but what Israel
ought to pray for. Note, \[1.\] God is the Lord of the harvest; my
Father is the Husbandman, [Joh 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001.md).
It is the vineyard of the Lord of hosts, [Isa
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#007.md). It is for him and to him, and to
his service and honour, that the harvest is gathered in. Ye are God's
husbandry ([Co1 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#009).md); his threshing,
and the corn of his floor, [Isa 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#010.md).
He orders every thing concerning the harvest as he pleases; when and
where the labourers shall work, and how long; and it is very comfortable
to those who wish well to the harvest-work, that God himself presides in
it, who will be sure to order all for the best. \[2.\] Ministers are and
should be labourers in God's harvest; the ministry is a work and must be
attended to accordingly; it is harvest-work, which is needful work; work
that requires every thing to be done in its season, and diligence to do
it thoroughly; but it is pleasant work; they reap in joy, and the joy of
the preachers of the gospel is likened to the joy of harvest ([Isa
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002.md), [Isa
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#003).md); and he that reapeth receiveth
wages; the hire of the labourers that reap down God's field, shall not
be kept back, as theirs was, [Jam 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#004.md).
\[3.\] It is God's work to send forth labourers; Christ makes ministers
([Eph 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011).md); the office is of his
appointing, the qualifications of his working, the call of his giving.
They will not be owned nor paid as labourers, that run without their
errand, unqualified, uncalled. How shall they preach except they be
sent? \[4.\] All that love Christ and souls, should show it by their
earnest prayers to God, especially when the harvest is plenteous, that
he would send forth more skillful, faithful, wise, and industrious
labourers into his harvest; that he would raise up such as he will own
in the conversion of sinners and the edification of saints; would give
them a spirit for the work, call them to it, and succeed them in it;
that he would give them wisdom to win souls; that he would thrust forth
labourers, so some; intimating unwillingness to go forth, because of
their own weakness and the people's badness, and opposition from men,
that endeavour to thrust them out of the harvest; but we should pray
that all contradiction from within and from without, may be conquered
and got over. Christ puts his friends upon praying this, just before he
sends apostles forth to labour in the harvest. Note, It is a good sign
God is about to bestow some special mercy upon a people, when he stirs
up those that have an interest at the throne of grace, to pray for it,
[Psa 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017.md). Further observe, that
Christ said this to his disciples, who were to be employed as labourers.
They must pray, First, That God would send them forth. Here am I, send
me, [Isa 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#008.md). Note, Commissions, given
in answer to prayer, are most likely to be successful; Paul is a chosen
vessel, for behold he prays, [Act
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#011.md), [Act
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015.md). Secondly, That he would send
others forth. Note, Not the people only, but those who are themselves
ministers, should pray for the increase of ministers. Though
self-interest makes those that seek their own things desirous to be
placed alone (the fewer ministers the more preferments), yet those that
seek the things of Christ, desire more workmen, that more work may be
done, though they be eclipsed by it.
