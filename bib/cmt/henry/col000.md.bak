An Exposition, with Practical Observations, of The Epistle of St. Paul
to the Colossians

Colosse was a considerable city of Phrygia, and probably not far from
Laodicea and Hierapolis; we find these mentioned together, [Col
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#013.md). It is now buried in ruins, and
the memory of it chiefly preserved in this epistle. The design of the
epistle is to warn them of the danger of the Jewish zealots, who pressed
the necessity of observing the ceremonial law; and to fortify them
against the mixture of the Gentile philosophy with their Christian
principles. He professes a great satisfaction in their stedfastness and
constancy, and encourages them to perseverance. It was written about the
same time with the epistles to the Ephesians and Philippians, a.d. 62,
and in the same place, while he was now a prisoner at Rome. He was not
idle in his confinement, and the word of God was not bound.

This epistle, like that to the Romans, was written to those he had never
seen, nor had any personal acquaintance with. The church planted at
Colosse was not by Paul's ministry, but by the ministry of Epaphras or
Epaphroditus, an evangelist, one whom he delegated to preach the gospel
among the Gentiles; and yet, I. There was a flourishing church at
Colosse, and one which was eminent and famous among the churches. One
would have thought none would have come to be flourishing churches but
those which Paul himself had planted; but here was a flourishing church
planted by Epaphras. God is sometimes pleased to make use of the
ministry of those who are of less note, and lower gifts, for doing great
service to his church. God uses what hands he pleases, and is not tied
to those of note, that the excellence of the power may appear to be of
God and not of men, [Co2 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007.md). II.
Though Paul had not the planting of this church, yet he did not
therefore neglect it; nor, in writing his epistles, does he make any
difference between that and other churches. The Colossians, who were
converted by the ministry of Epaphras, were as dear to him, and he was
as much concerned for their welfare, as the Philippians, or any others
who were converted by his ministry. Thus he put an honour upon an
inferior minister, and teaches us not to be selfish, nor think all that
honour lost which goes beside ourselves. We learn, in his example, not
to think it a disparagement to us to water what others have planted, or
build upon the foundation which others have laid: as he himself, as a
wise master-builder, laid the foundation, and another built thereon,
[Co1 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#010.md).
