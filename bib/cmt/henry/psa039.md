### [Psalms Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 39:0</span></span>

David seems to have been in a great strait when he penned this psalm,
and, upon some account or other, very uneasy; for it is with some
difficulty that he conquers his passion, and composes his spirit himself
to take that good counsel which he had given to others (37) to rest in
the Lord, and wait patiently for him, without fretting; for it is easier
to give the good advice than to give the good example of quietness under
affliction. What was the particular trouble which gave occasion for the
conflict David was now in does not appear. Perhaps it was the death of
some dear friend or relation that was the trial of his patience, and
that suggested to him these meditations of morality; and at the same
time, it should seem too, he himself was weak and ill, and under some
prevailing distemper. His enemies likewise were seeking advantages
against him, and watched for his halting, that they might have something
to reproach him for. Thus aggrieved, I. He relates the struggle that was
in his breast between grace and corruption, between passion and patience
([Psa 39:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001).md). II. He meditates upon
the doctrine of man's frailty and mortality, and prays to God to
instruct him in it ([Psa 39:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#004).md). III.
He applies to God for the pardon of his sons, the removal of his
afflictions, and the lengthening out of his life till he was ready for
death ([Psa 39:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#007).md). This is a
funeral psalm, and very proper for the occasion; in singing it we should
get our hearts duly affected with the brevity, uncertainty, and
calamitous state of human life; and those on whose comforts God has, by
death, made breaches, will find this psalm of great use to them, in
order to their obtaining what we ought much to aim at under such an
affliction, which is to get it sanctified to us for our spiritual
benefit and to get our hearts reconciled to the holy will of God in it

To the chief musician, even to Jeduthun. A psalm of David.

[Psalms 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 39:1</span></span>

David here recollects, and leaves upon record, the workings of his heart
under his afflictions; and it is good for us to do so, that what was
thought amiss may be amended, and what was well thought of may be
improved the next time.

I. He remembered the covenants he had made with God to walk
circumspectly, and to be very cautious both of what he did and what he
said. When at any time we are tempted to sin, and are in danger of
falling into it, we must call to mind the solemn vows we have made
against sin, against the particular sin we are upon the brink of. God
can, and will, remind us of them ([Jer
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020.md), Thou saidst, I will not
transgress), and therefore we ought to remind ourselves of them. So
David did here.

1\. He remembers that he had resolved, in general, to be very cautious
and circumspect in his walking ([Psa
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001).md): I said, I will take heed to my
ways; and it was well said, and what he would never unsay and therefore
must never gainsay. Note, (1.) It is the great concern of every one of
us to take heed to our ways, that is, to walk circumspectly, while
others walk at all adventures. (2.) We ought stedfastly to resolve that
we will take heed to our ways, and frequently to renew that resolution.
Fast bind, fast find. (3.) Having resolved to take heed to our ways, we
must, upon all occasions, remind ourselves of that resolution, for it is
a covenant never to be forgotten, but which we must be always mindful
of.

2\. He remembers that he had in particular covenanted against
tongue-sins - that he would not sin with his tongue, that he would not
speak amiss, either to offend God or offend the generation of the
righteous, [Psa 73:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#015.md). it is not so
easy as we could wish not to sin in thought; but, if an evil thought
should arise in his mind, he would lay his hand upon his mouth, and
suppress it, that it should go no further: and this is so great an
attainment that, if any offend not in word, the same is a perfect man;
and so needful a one that of him who seems to be religious, but bridles
not his tongue, it is declared His religion is vain. David had resolved,
(1.) That he would at all times watch against tongue-sins: "I will keep
a bridle, or muzzle, upon my mouth." He would keep a bridle upon it, as
upon the head; watchfulness in the act and exercise is the hand upon the
bridle. he would keep a muzzle upon it, as upon an unruly dog that is
fierce and does mischief; by particular stedfast resolution corruption
is restrained from breaking out at the lips, and so is muzzled. (2.)
That he would double his guard against them when there was most danger
of scandal - when the wicked is before me. When he was in company with
the wicked he would take heed of saying any thing that might harden them
or give occasion to them to blaspheme. If good men fall into bad
company, they must take heed what they say. Or, when the wicked is
before me, in my thoughts. When he was contemplating the pride and
power, the prosperity and flourishing estate, of evil-doers, he was
tempted to speak amiss; and therefore then he would take special care
what he said. Note, The stronger the temptation to a sin is the stronger
the resolution must be against it.

II\. Pursuant to these covenants he made a shift with much ado to bridle
his tongue ([Psa 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#002).md): I was dumb
with silence; I held my peace even from good. His silence was
commendable; and the greater the provocation was the more praiseworthy
was his silence. Watchfulness and resolution, in the strength of God's
grace, will do more towards the bridling of the tongue than we can
imagine, though it be an unruly evil. But what shall we say of his
keeping silence even from good? Was it his wisdom that he refrained from
good discourse when the wicked were before him, because he would not
cast pearls before swine? I rather think it was his weakness; because he
might not say any thing, he would say nothing, but ran into an extreme,
which was a reproach to the law, for that prescribes a mean between
extremes. The same law which forbids all corrupt communication requires
that which is good and to the use of edifying, [Eph
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#029.md).

III\. The less he spoke the more he thought and the more warmly. Binding
the distempered part did but draw the humour to it: My sorrow was
stirred, my heart was hot within me, [Psa
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#003.md). He could bridle his tongue, but
he could not keep his passion under; though he suppressed the smoke,
that was as a fire in his bones, and, while he was musing upon his
afflictions and upon the prosperity of the wicked, the fire burned.
Note, Those that are of a fretful discontented spirit ought not to pore
much, for, while they suffer their thoughts to dwell upon the causes of
the calamity, the fire of their discontent is fed with fuel and burns
the more furiously. Impatience is a sin that has its ill cause within
ourselves, and that is musing, and its ill effects upon ourselves, and
that is no less than burning. If therefore we would prevent the mischief
of ungoverned passions, we must redress the grievance of ungoverned
thoughts.

IV\. When he did speak, at last, it was to the purpose: At the last I
spoke with my tongue. Some make what he said to be the breach of his
good purpose, and conclude that, in what he said, he sinned with his
tongue; and so they make what follows to be a passionate wish that he
might die, like Elijah ([Kg1 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#004).md) and
Job, [Job 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#008.md), [Job
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#009.md). But I rather take it to be, not
the breach of his good purpose, but the reformation of his mistake in
carrying it too far; he had kept silence from good, but now he would so
keep silence no longer. He had nothing to say to the wicked that were
before him, for to them he knew not how to place his words, but, after
long musing, the first word he said was a prayer, and a devout
meditation upon a subject which it will be good for us all to think much
of.

1\. He prays to God to make him sensible of the shortness and
uncertainty of life and the near approach of death ([Psa
39:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#004).md): Lord, make me to know my end
and the measure of my days. He does not mean, "Lord, let me know how
long I shall live and when I shall die." We could not, in faith, pray
such a prayer; for God has nowhere promised to let us know, but has, in
wisdom, locked up that knowledge among the secret things which belong
not to us, nor would it be good for us to know it. But, Lord, make me to
know my end, means, "Lord, give me wisdom and grace to consider it ([Deu
32:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#029).md) and to improve what I know
concerning it." The living know that they shall die ([Ecc
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#005).md), but few care for thinking of
death; we have therefore need to pray that God by his grace would
conquer that aversion which is in our corrupt hearts to the thoughts of
death. "Lord, make me to consider," (1.) "What death is. It is my end,
the end of my life, and all the employments and enjoyments of life. It
is the end of all men," [Ecc 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#002.md). It
is a final period to our state of probation and preparation, and an
awful entrance upon a state of recompence and retribution. To the wicked
man it is the end of all joys; to a godly man it is the end of all
griefs. "Lord, give me to know my end, to be better acquainted with
death, to make it more familiar to me ([Job
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#014).md), and to be more affected with
the greatness of the change. Lord, give me to consider what a serious
thing it is to die." (2.) "How near it is. Lord, give me to consider the
measure of my days, that they are measured in the counsel of God" (the
end is a fixed end, so the word signifies; my days are determined, [Job
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#005).md) "and that the measure is but
short: My days will soon be numbered and finished." When we look upon
death as a thing at a distance we are tempted to adjourn the necessary
preparations for it; but, when we consider how short life is, we shall
see ourselves concerned to do what our hand finds to do, not only with
all our might, but with all possible expedition. (3.) That it is
continually working in us: "Lord, give me to consider how frail I am,
how scanty the stock of life is, and how faint the spirits which are as
the oil to keep that lamp burning." We find by daily experience that the
earthly house of this tabernacle is mouldering and going to decay:
"Lord, make us to consider this, that we may secure mansions in the
house not made with hands."

2\. He meditates upon the brevity and vanity of life, pleading them with
God for relief under the burdens of life, as Job often, and pleading
them with himself for his quickening to the business of life.

(1.) Man's life on earth is short and of no continuance, and that is a
reason why we should sit loose to it and prepare for the end of it ([Psa
39:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#005).md): Behold, thou hast made my days
as a hand-breadth, the breadth of four fingers, a certain dimension, a
small one, and the measure whereof we have always about us, always
before our eyes. We need no rod, no pole, no measuring line, wherewith
to take the dimension of our days, nor any skill in arithmetic wherewith
to compute the number of them. No; we have the standard of them at our
fingers' end, and there is no multiplication of it; it is but one
hand-breadth in all. Our time is short, and God has made it so; for the
number of our months is with him. It is short, and he knows it to be so:
It is as nothing before thee. he remembers how short our time is, [Psa
79:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001.md) :47. It is nothing in
comparison with thee; so some. All time is nothing to God's eternity,
much less our share of time.

(2.) Man's life on earth is vain and of no value, and therefore it is
folly to be fond of it and wisdom to make sure of a better life. Adam is
Abel - man is vanity, in his present state. He is not what he seems to
be, has not what he promised himself. He and all his comforts lie at a
continual uncertainty; and if there were not another life after this,
all things considered, he were made in vain. He is vanity; he is mortal,
he is mutable. Observe, \[1.\] How emphatically this truth is expressed
here. First, Every man is vanity, without exception; high and low, rich
and poor, all meet in this. Secondly, He is so at his best estate, when
he is young, and strong, and healthful, in wealth and honour, and the
height of prosperity; when he is most easy, and merry, and secure, and
thinks his mountain stands strong. Thirdly, He is altogether vanity, as
vain as you can imagine. All man is all vanity (so it may be read);
every thing about him is uncertain; nothing is substantial and durable
but what relates to the new man. Fourthly, Verily he is so. This is a
truth of undoubted certainty, but which we are very unwilling to believe
and need to have solemnly attested to us, as indeed it is by frequent
instances. Fifthly, Selah is annexed, as a note commanding observation.
"Stop here, and pause awhile, that you may take time to consider and
apply this truth, that every man is vanity." We ourselves are so. \[2.\]
For the proof of the vanity of man, as mortal, he here mentions three
things, and shows the vanity of each of them, [Psa
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#006.md). First, The vanity of our joys
and honours: Surely every man walks (even when he walks in state, when
he walks in pleasure) in a shadow, in an image, in a vain show. When he
makes a figure his fashion passes away, and his great pomp is but great
fancy, [Act 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#023.md). It is but a show,
and therefore a vain show, like the rainbow, the gaudy colours of which
must needs vanish and disappear quickly when the substratum is but a
cloud, a vapour; such is life ([Jam
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#014).md), and therefore such are all the
gaieties of it. Secondly, The vanity of our griefs and fears. Surely
they are disquieted in vain. Our disquietudes are often groundless (we
vex ourselves without any just cause, and the occasions of our trouble
are often the creatures of our own fancy and imagination), and they are
always fruitless; we disquiet ourselves in vain, for we cannot, with all
our disquietment, alter the nature of things nor the counsel of God;
things will be as they are when we have disquieted ourselves ever so
much about them. Thirdly, The vanity of our cares and toils. Man takes a
great deal of pains to heap up riches, and they are but like heaps of
manure in the furrows of the field, good for nothing unless they be
spread. but, when he has filled his treasures with his trash, he knows
not who shall gather them, nor to whom they shall descend when he is
gone; for he shall not take them away with him. He asks not, For whom do
I labour? and that is his folly, [Ecc
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#008.md). but, if he did ask, he could not
tell whether he should be a wise man or a fool, a friend or a foe, [Ecc
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#019.md). This is vanity.

[Psalms 39:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 39:7</span></span>

The psalmist, having meditated on the shortness and uncertainty of life,
and the vanity and vexation of spirit that attend all the comforts of
life, here, in these verses, turns his eyes and heart heaven-ward. When
there is no solid satisfaction to be had in the creature it is to be
found in God, and in communion with him; and to him we should be driven
by our disappointments in the world. David here expresses,

I. His dependence on God, [Psa 39:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#007.md).
Seeing all is vanity, and man himself is so, 1. He despairs of a
happiness in the things of the world, and disclaims all expectations
from it: "Now, Lord, what wait I for? Even nothing from the things of
sense and time; I have nothing to wish for, nothing to hope for, from
this earth." Note, The consideration of the vanity and frailty of human
life should deaden our desires to the things of this world and lower our
expectations from it. "If the world be such a thing as this, God deliver
me from having, or seeking, my portion in it." We cannot reckon upon
constant health and prosperity, nor upon comfort in any relation; for it
is all as uncertain as our continuance here. "Though I have sometimes
foolishly promised myself this and the other from the world, I am now of
another mind." 2. He takes hold of happiness and satisfaction in God: My
hope is in thee. Note, When creature-confidences fail, it is our comfort
that we have a God to go to, a God to trust to, and we should thereby be
quickened to take so much the faster hold of him by faith.

II\. His submission to God, and his cheerful acquiescence in his holy
will, [Psa 39:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#009.md). If our hope be in God
for a happiness in the other world, we may well afford to reconcile
ourselves to all the dispensations of his providence concerning us in
this world: "I was dumb; I opened not my mouth in a way of complaint and
murmuring." He now again recovered that serenity and sedateness of mind
which were disturbed, [Psa 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#002.md).
Whatever comforts he is deprived of, whatever crosses he is burdened
with, he will be easy. "Because thou didst it; it did not come to pass
by chance, but according to thy appointment." We may here see, 1. A good
God doing all, and ordering all events concerning us. Of every event we
may say, "This is the finger of God; it is the Lord's doing," whoever
were the instruments. 2. A good man, for that reason, saying nothing
against it. He is dumb, he has nothing to object, no question to ask, no
dispute to raise upon it. All that God does is well done.

III\. His desire towards God, and the prayers he puts up to him. Is any
afflicted? let him pray, as David here,

1\. For the pardoning of his sin and the preventing of his shame, [Psa
39:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#008.md). Before he prays ([Psa
39:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#010).md), Remove thy stroke from me, he
prays ([Psa 39:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#008).md), "Deliver me from
all my offences, from the guilt I have contracted, the punishment I have
deserved, and the power of corruption by which I have been enslaved."
When God forgives our sins he delivers us from them, he delivers us from
them all. He pleads, Make me not a reproach to the foolish. Wicked
people are foolish people; and they then show their folly most when they
think to show their wit, by scoffing at God's people. When David prays
that God would pardon his sins, and not make him a reproach, it is to be
taken as a prayer for peace of conscience ("Lord, leave me not to the
power of melancholy, which the foolish will laugh at me for"), and as a
prayer for grace, that God would never leave him to himself, so far as
to do any thing that might make him a reproach to bad men. Note, This is
a good reason why we should both watch and pray against sin, because the
credit of our profession is nearly concerned in the preservation of our
integrity.

2\. For the removal of his affliction, that he might speedily be eased
of his present burdens ([Psa 39:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#010).md):
Remove thy stroke away from me. Note, When we are under the correcting
hand of God our eye must be to God himself, and not to any other, for
relief. He only that inflicts the stroke can remove it; and we may then
in faith, and with satisfaction, pray that our afflictions may be
removed, when our sins are pardoned ([Isa
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#017).md), and when, as here, the
affliction is sanctified and has done its work, and we are humbled under
the hand of God.

(1.) He pleads the great extremity he was reduced to by his affliction,
which made him the proper object of God's compassion: I am consumed by
the blow of thy hand. His sickness prevailed to such a degree that his
spirits failed, his strength was wasted, and his body emaciated. "The
blow, or conflict, of thy hand has brought me even to the gates of
death." Note, The strongest, and boldest, and best of men cannot bear up
under, much less make head against, the power of God's wrath. It was not
his case only, but any man will find himself an unequal match for the
Almighty, [Psa 39:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#011.md). When God, at any
time, contends with us, when with rebukes he corrects us, \[1.\] We
cannot impeach the equity of his controversy, but must acknowledge that
he is righteous in it; for, whenever he corrects man, it is for
iniquity. Our ways and our doings procure the trouble to ourselves, and
we are beaten with a rod of our own making. It is the yoke of our
transgressions, though it be bound with his hand, [Lam
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#014.md). \[2.\] We cannot oppose the
effects of his controversy, but he will be too hard for us. As we have
nothing to move in arrest of his judgment, so we have no way of escaping
the execution. God's rebukes make man's beauty to consume away like a
moth; we often see, we sometimes feel, how much the body is weakened and
decayed by sickness in a little time; the countenance is changed; where
are the ruddy cheek and lip, the sprightly eye, the lively look, the
smiling face? It is the reverse of all this that presents itself to
view. What a poor thing is beauty; and what fools are those that are
proud of it, or in love with it, when it will certainly, and may
quickly, be consumed thus! Some make the moth to represent man, who is
as easily crushed as a moth with the touch of a finger, [Job
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#019.md). Others make it to represent the
divine rebukes, which silently and insensibly waste and consume us, as
the moth does the garment. All this abundantly proves what he had said
before, that surely every man is vanity, weak and helpless; so he will
be found when God comes to contend with him.

(2.) He pleads the good impressions made upon him by his affliction. He
hoped that the end was accomplished for which it was sent, and that
therefore it would be removed in mercy; and unless an affliction has
done its work, though it may be removed, it is not removed in mercy.
\[1.\] It had set him a weeping, and he hoped God would take notice of
that. When the Lord God called to mourning, he answered the call and
accommodated himself to the dispensation, and therefore could, in faith,
pray, Lord, hold not thy peace at my tears, [Psa
39:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#012.md). He that does not willingly
afflict and grieve the children of men, much less his own children, will
not hold his peace at their tears, but will either speak deliverance for
them (and, if he speak, it is done) or in the mean time speak comfort to
them and make them to hear joy and gladness. \[2.\] It had set him a
praying; and afflictions are sent to stir up prayer. If they have that
effect, and when we are afflicted we pray more, and pray better, than
before, we may hope that God will hear our prayer and give ear to our
cry; for the prayer which by his providence he gives occasion for, and
which by his Spirit of grace he indites, shall not return void. \[3.\]
It had helped to wean him from the world and to take his affections off
from it. Now he began, more than ever, to look upon himself as a
stranger and sojourner here, like all his fathers, not at home in this
world, but travelling through it to another, to a better, and would
never reckon himself at home till he came to heaven. He pleads it with
God: "Lord, take cognizance of me, and of my wants and burdens, for I am
a stranger here, and therefore meet with strange usage; I am slighted
and oppressed as a stranger; and whence should I expect relief but from
thee, from that other country to which I belong?"

3\. He prays for a reprieve yet a little longer ([Psa
39:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#013).md): "O spare me, ease me, raise me
up from this illness that I may recover strength both in body and mind,
that I may get into a more calm and composed frame of spirit, and may be
better prepared for another world, before I go hence by death, and shall
be no more in this world." Some make this to be a passionate wish that
God would send him help quickly or it would be too late, like that, [Job
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#020.md), [Job
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021.md). But I rather take it as a pious
prayer that God would continue him here till by his grace he had made
him fit to go hence, and that he might finish the work of life before
his life was finished. Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee.
