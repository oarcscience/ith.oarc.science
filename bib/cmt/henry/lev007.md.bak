### [Leviticus Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 7:0</span></span>

Here is, I. The law of the trespass-offering ([Lev
7:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001).md), with some further directions
concerning the burnt-offering and the meat-offering ([Lev
7:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#008).md). II. The law of the
peace-offering. The eating of it ([Lev
7:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#011).md), on which occasion the
prohibition of eating fat or blood is repeated ([Lev
7:22-27](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#022).md), and the priests' share of it
([Lev 7:28-34](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#028).md). III. The conclusion of
those institutions ([Lev 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#035), etc..md).

[Leviticus 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 7:1</span></span>

Observe here, 1. Concerning the trespass-offering, that, being much of
the same nature with the sin-offering, it was to be governed by the same
rules, [Lev 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#006.md). When the blood and
fat were offered to God to make atonement, the priests were to eat the
flesh, as that of the sin-offering, in the holy place. The Jews have a
tradition (as we have it from the learned bishop Patrick) concerning the
sprinkling of the blood of the trespass-offering round about upon the
altar, "That there was a scarlet line which went round about the altar
exactly in the middle, and the blood of the burnt-offerings was
sprinkled round about above the line, but that of the trespass-offerings
and peace-offerings round about below the line." As to the flesh of the
trespass-offering, the right to it belonged to the priest that offered
it, [Lev 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#007.md). He that did the work
must have the wages. This was an encouragement to the priests to give
diligent attendance on the altar; the more ready and busy they were the
more they got. Note, The more diligent we are in the services of
religion the more we shall reap of the advantages of it. But any of the
priests, and the males of their families, might be invited by him to
whom it belonged to partake with him: Every male among the priests shall
eat thereof, that is, may eat thereof, in the holy place, [Lev
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#006.md). And, no doubt, it was the usage
to treat one another with those perquisites of their office, by which
friendship and fellowship were kept up among the priests. Freely they
had received, and must freely give. It seems the offerer was not himself
to have any share of his trespass-offering, as he was to have of his
peace-offering; but it was all divided between the altar and the priest.
They offered peace-offerings in thankfulness for mercy, and then it was
proper to feast; but they offered trespass-offerings in sorrow for sin,
and then fasting was more proper, in token of holy mourning, and a
resolution to abstain from sin. 2. Concerning the burnt-offering it is
here appointed that the priest that offered it should have the skin
([Lev 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#008).md), which no doubt he might
make money of. "This" (the Jews say) "is meant only for the
burnt-offerings which were offered by particular persons; for the profit
of the skins of the daily burnt-offerings for the congregation went to
the repair of the sanctuary." Some suggest that this appointment will
help us to understand God's clothing our first parents with coats of
skins, [Gen 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#021.md). It is probable that
the beasts whose skins they were were offered in sacrifice as whole
burnt-offerings, and that Adam was the priest that offered them; and
then God gave him the skins, as his fee, to make clothes of for himself
and his wife, in remembrance of which the skins ever after pertained to
the priest; and see [Gen 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#016.md). 3.
Concerning the meat-offering, if it was dressed, it was fit to be eaten
immediately; and therefore the priest that offered it was to have it,
[Lev 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#009.md). If it was dry, there was not
so much occasion for being in haste to use it; and therefore an equal
dividend of it must be made among all the priests that were then in
waiting, [Lev 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#010.md).

[Leviticus 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 7:11</span></span>

All this relates to the peace-offerings: it is the repetition and
explication of what we had before, with various additions.

I. The nature and intention of the peace-offerings are here more
distinctly opened. They were offered either, 1. In thankfulness for some
special mercy received, such as recovery from sickness, preservation in
a journey, deliverance at sea, redemption out of captivity, all which
are specified in Ps. 107, and for them men are called upon to offer the
sacrifice of thanksgiving, [Lev 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#022.md).
Or, 2. In performance of some vow which a man made when he was in
distress ([Lev 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#016).md), and this was
less honourable than the former, though the omission of it would have
been more culpable. Or, 3. In supplication for some special mercy which
a man was in the pursuit and expectation of, here called a voluntary
offering. This accompanied a man's prayers, as the former did his
praises. We do not find that men were bound by the law, unless they had
bound themselves by vow, to offer these peace-offerings upon such
occasions, as they were to bring their sacrifices of atonement in case
of sin committed. Not but that prayer and praise are as much our duty as
repentance is; but here, in the expressions of their sense of mercy, God
left them more to their liberty than in the expressions of their sense
of sin - to try the generosity of their devotion, and that their
sacrifices, being free-will offerings, might be the more laudable and
acceptable; and, by obliging them to bring the sacrifices of atonement,
God would show the necessity of the great propitiation.

II\. The rites and ceremonies about the peace-offerings are enlarged
upon.

1\. If the peace-offering was offered for a thanksgiving, a
meat-offering must be offered with it, cakes of several sorts, and
wafers ([Lev 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#012).md), and (which was
peculiar to the peace-offerings) leavened bread must be offered, not to
be burnt upon the altar, that was forbidden ([Lev
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#011).md), but to be eaten with the flesh
of the sacrifice, that nothing might be wanting to make it a complete
and pleasant feast; for unleavened bread was less grateful to the taste,
and therefore, though enjoined in the passover for a particular reason,
yet in other festivals leavened bread, which was lighter and more
pleasant, was appointed, that men might feast at God's table as well as
at their own. And some think that a meat-offering is required to be
brought with every peace-offering, as well as with that of thanksgiving,
by that law ([Lev 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#029).md) which requires
an oblation with it, that the table might be as well furnished as the
altar.

2\. The flesh of the peace-offerings, both that which was the priest's
share and that which was the offerer's must be eaten quickly, and not
kept long, either raw, or dressed, cold. If it was a peace-offering for
thanksgiving, it must be all eaten the same day ([Lev
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#016).md); if a vow, or voluntary
offering, it must be eaten either the same day or the day after, [Lev
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#016.md). If any was left beyond the time
limited, it was to be burnt ([Lev
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#017).md); and, if any person ate of what
was so left their conduct should be animadverted upon as a very high
misdemeanour, [Lev 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#018.md). Though they
were not obliged to eat it in the holy place, as those offerings that
are called most holy, but might take it to their own tents and feast
upon it there, yet God would by this law make them to know a difference
between that and other meat, and religiously to observe it, that whereas
they might keep other meat cold in the house as long as they thought
fit, and warm it again if they pleased, and eat it three or four days
after, they might not do so with the flesh of their peace-offerings, but
it must be eaten immediately. (1.) Because God would not have that holy
flesh to be in danger of putrefying, or being fly-blown, to prevent
which it must be salted with fire (as the expression is, [Mar
9:49](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#049).md) if it were kept; as, if it was
used, it must be salted with salt. (2.) Because God would not have his
people to be niggardly and sparing, and distrustful of providence, but
cheerfully to enjoy what God gives them ([Ecc
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015).md), and to do good with it, and not
to be anxiously solicitous for the morrow. (3.) The flesh of the
peace-offerings was God's treat, and therefore God would have the
disposal of it; and he orders it to be used generously for the
entertainment of their friends, and charitably for the relief of the
poor, to show that he is a bountiful benefactor, giving us all things
richly to enjoy, the bread of the day in its day. If the sacrifice was
thanksgiving, they were especially obliged thus to testify their holy
joy in God's goodness by their holy feasting. This law is made very
strict ([Lev 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#018).md), that if the
offerer did not take care to have all his offering eaten by himself or
his family, his friends or the poor, within the time limited by the law,
or, in the event of any part being left, to burn it (which was the most
decent way of disposing of it, the sacrifices upon the altar being
consumed by fire), then his offering should not be accepted, nor imputed
to him. Note, All the benefit of our religious services is lost if we do
not improve them, and conduct ourselves aright afterwards. They are not
acceptable to God if they have not a due influence upon ourselves. If a
man seemed generous in bringing a peace-offering, and yet afterwards
proved sneaking and paltry in the using of it, it was as if he had never
brought it; nay, it shall be an abomination. Note, There is no mean
between God's acceptance and his abhorrence. If our persons and
performances are sincere and upright, they are accepted; if not, they
are an abomination, [Pro 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#008.md). He that
eats it after the time appointed shall bear his iniquity, that is, he
shall be cut off from his people, as it is explained ([Lev
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#008).md), where this law is repeated.
This law of eating the peace-offerings before the third day, that they
might not putrefy, is applicable tot the resurrection of Christ after
two days, that, being God's holy one, he might not see corruption, [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010.md). And some think that it
instructs us speedily, and without delay, to partake of Christ and his
grace, feeding and feasting thereon by faith today, while it is called
today ([Heb 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#013.md), [Heb
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#014).md), for it will be too late
shortly.

3\. But the flesh, and those that eat it, must be pure. (1.) The flesh
must touch no unclean thing; if it did, it must not be eaten, but burnt,
[Lev 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#019.md). If, in carrying it from the
altar to the place where it was eaten, a dog touched it, or it touched a
dead body or any other unclean thing, it was then unfit to be used in a
religious feast. Every thing we honour the holy God with must be pure
and carefully kept from all pollution. It is a case adjudged ([Hag
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#012).md) that the holy flesh could not by
its touch communicate holiness to what was common; but by this law it is
determined that by the touch of that which was unclean it received
pollution from it, which intimates that the infection of sin is more
easily and more frequently communicated than the savour of grace. (2.)
It must not be eaten by any unclean person. When a person was upon any
account ceremonially unclean it was at his peril if he presumed to eat
of the flesh of the peace-offerings, [Lev
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#020.md), [Lev
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#021.md). Holy things are only for holy
persons; the holiness of the food being ceremonial, those were
incapacitated to partake of it who lay under any ceremonial uncleanness;
but we are hereby taught to preserve ourselves pure from all the
pollutions of sin, that we may have the benefit and comfort of Christ's
sacrifice, [Pe1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001.md), [Pe1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#002.md). Our consciences must be purged
from dead works, that we may be fit to serve the living God, [Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014.md). But if any dare to partake of
the table of the Lord under the pollution of sin unrepented of, and so
profane sacred things, they eat and drink judgment to themselves, as
those did that ate of the peace-offerings ([Lev
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#020).md) and again ([Lev
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#021).md), that they pertain unto the
Lord: whatever pertains to the Lord is sacred, and must be used with
great reverence and not with unhallowed hands. "Be you holy, for God is
holy, and you pertain to him."

4\. The eating of blood and the fat of the inwards is here again
prohibited; and the prohibition is annexed as before to the law of the
peace-offerings, [Lev 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#017). (1..md) The
prohibition of the fat seems to be confined to those beasts which were
used for sacrifice, the bullocks, sheep, and goats: but of the roe-buck,
the hart, and other clean beasts, they might eat the fat; for those only
of which offerings were brought are mentioned here, [Lev
7:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#023.md). This was to preserve in their
minds a reverence for God's altar, on which the fat of the inwards was
burnt. The Jews say, "If a man eat so much as an olive of forbidden fat
- if he do it presumptuously, he is in danger of being cut off by the
hand of God - if ignorantly, he is to bring a sin-offering, and so to
pay dearly for his carelessness." To eat of the flesh of that which died
of itself, or was torn of beasts, was unlawful; but to eat of the fat of
such was doubly unlawful, [Lev 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#024.md).
(2.) The prohibition of blood is more general ([Lev
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#026.md), [Lev
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#027).md), because the fat was offered to
God only by way of acknowledgment, but the blood made atonement for the
soul, and so typified Christ's sacrifice much more than the burning of
the fat did; to this therefore a greater reverence must be paid, till
these types had their accomplishment in the offering up of the body of
Christ once for all. The Jews rightly expound this law as forbidding
only the blood of the life, as they express it, not that which we call
the gravy, for of that they supposed it was lawful to eat.

5\. The priest's share of the peace-offerings is here prescribed. Out of
every beast that was offered for a peace-offering the priest that
offered it was to have to himself the breast and the right shoulder,
[Lev 7:30-34](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#030). Observe here, (1..md) That
when the sacrifice was killed the offerer himself must, with his own
hands, present God's part of it, that he might signify thereby his
cheerfully giving it up to God, and his desire that it might be
accepted. He was with his own hands to lift it up, in token of his
regard to God as the God of heaven, and then to wave it to and fro, in
token of his regard to God as the Lord of the whole earth, to whom thus,
as far as he could reach, he offered it, showing his readiness and wish
to do him honour. Now that which was thus heaved and waved was the fat,
and the breast, and the right shoulder, it was all offered to God; and
then he ordered the fat to his altar, and the breast and shoulder to his
priest, both being his receivers. (2.) That when the fat was burnt the
priest took his part, on which he and his family were to feast, as well
as the offerer and his family. In holy joy and thanksgiving, it is good
to have our ministers to go before us, and to be our mouth to God. The
melody is sweet when he that sows and those that reap rejoice together.
Some observe a significancy in the parts assigned to the priests: the
breast and the shoulder intimate the affections and the actions, which
must be devoted to the honour of God by all his people and to the
service also of the church by all his priests. Christ, our great
peace-offering, feasts all his spiritual priests with the breast and
shoulder, with the dearest love and the sweetest and strongest supports;
for his is the wisdom of God and the power of God. When Saul was
designed for a king Samuel ordered the shoulder of the peace-offering to
be set before him ([Sa1 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#024).md), which
gave him a hint of something great and sacred intended for him. Jesus
Christ is our great peace-offering; for he made himself a sacrifice, not
only to atone for sin, and so to save us from the curse, but to purchase
a blessing for us, and all good. By our joyfully partaking of the
benefits of redemption we feast upon the sacrifice, to signify which the
Lord's supper was instituted.

[Leviticus 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">lev 7:35</span></span>

Here is the conclusion of these laws concerning the sacrifices, though
some of them are afterwards repeated and explained. The are to be
considered, 1. As a grant to the priests, [Lev
7:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#035.md), [Lev
7:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#036.md). In the day they were ordained to
that work and office this provision was made for their comfortable
maintenance. Note, God will take care that those who are employed for
him be well paid and well provided for. Those that receive the anointing
of the Spirit to minister unto the Lord shall have their portion, and it
shall be a worthy portion, out of the offerings of the Lord; for God's
work is its own wages, and there is a present reward of obedience in
obedience. 2. As a statute for ever to the people, that they should
bring these offerings according to the rules prescribed, and cheerfully
give the priests their share out of them. God commanded the children of
Israel to offer their oblations, [Lev
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#038.md). Note, The solemn acts religious
worship are commanded. They are not things that we are left to our
liberty in, and which we may do or not do at our pleasure; but we are
under indispensable obligations to perform them in their season, and it
is at our peril if we omit them. The observance of the laws of Christ
cannot be less necessary than the observance of the laws of Moses was.
