### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 19:0</span></span>

We left David's army in triumph and yet David himself in tears: now here
we have, I. His return to himself, by the persuasion of Joab ([Sa2
19:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#001).md). II. His return to his kingdom
from his present banishment. 1. The men of Israel were forward of
themselves to bring him back ([Sa2
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#009.md), [Sa2
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#010).md). 2. The men of Judah were dealt
with by David's agents to do it ([Sa2
19:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#011).md) and did it ([Sa2
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#015).md). III. At the king's coming over
Jordan, Shimei's treason is pardoned ([Sa2
19:16-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#016).md), Mephibosheth's failure is
excused ([Sa2 19:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#024).md), and
Barzillai's kindness is thankfully owned, and recompensed to his son
([Sa2 19:31-39](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#031).md). IV. The men of Israel
quarrelled with the men of Judah, for not calling them to the ceremony
of the king's restoration, which occasioned a new rebellion, an account
of which we have in the next chapter ([Sa2
19:40-43](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#040).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 19:1</span></span>

Soon after the messengers had brought the news of the defeat and death
of Absalom to the court of Mahanaim, Joab and his victorious army
followed, to grace the king's triumphs and receive his further orders.
Now here we are told,

I. What a damp and disappointment it was to them to find the king in
tears for Absalom's death, which they construed as a token of
displeasure against them for what they had done, whereas they expected
him to have met them with joy and thanks for their good services: It was
told Joab, v. 1 The report of it ran through the army ([Sa2
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#002).md), how the king was grieved for
his son. The people will take particular notice what their princes say
and do. The more eyes we have upon us, and the greater our influence is,
the more need we have to speak and act wisely and to govern our passions
strictly. When they came to the city they found the king in close
mourning, [Sa2 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#004.md). He covered his
face, and would not so much as look up, nor take any notice of the
generals when they attended him. It could not but surprise them to find,
1. How the king proclaimed his passion, of which he ought to have been
ashamed, and which he would have striven to smother and conceal if he
had consulted either his reputation for courage, which was lessened by
his mean submission to the tyranny of so absurd a passion, or his
interest in the people, which would be prejudiced by his
discountenancing what was done in zeal for his honour and the public
safety. Yet see how he avows his grief: He cries with a loud voice, O my
son Absalom! "My servants have all come home safe, but where is my son?
He is dead; and, dying in sin, I fear he is lost for ever. I cannot now
say, I shall go to him, for my soul shall not be gathered with such
sinners; what shall be done for thee, O Absalom! my son, my son!" 2. How
he prolonged his passion, even till the army had come up to him, which
must be some time after he received the first intelligence. If he had
contented himself with giving vent to his passion for an hour or two
when he first heard the news, it would have been excusable, but to
continue it thus for so bad a son as Absalom, like Jacob for so good a
son as Joseph, with a resolution to go to the grave mourning and to
stain his triumphs with his tears, was very unwise and very unworthy.
Now see how ill this was taken by the people. They were loth to blame
the king, for whatever he did used to please them ([Sa2
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#036).md), but they took it as a great
mortification to them. Their victory was turned into mourning, [Sa2
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#002.md). They stole into the city as men
ashamed, [Sa2 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#003.md). In compliment to
their sovereign, they would not rejoice in that which they perceived so
afflictive to him, and yet they could not but be uneasy that they were
thus obliged to conceal their joy. Superiors ought not to put such
hardships as these on their inferiors.

II\. How plainly and vehemently Joab reproved David for this indiscreet
management of himself in this critical juncture. David never more needed
the hearts of his subjects than now, nor was ever more concerned to
secure his interest in their affections; and therefore whatever tended
to disoblige them now was the most impolitic thing he could do, and the
greatest wrong imaginable to his friends that adhered to him. Joab
therefore censures him, [Sa2 19:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#005.md).
He speaks a great deal of reason, but not with the respect and deference
which he owed to his prince. Is is fit to say to a king, Thou art
wicked? A plain case may be fairly pleaded with those that are above us,
and they may be reproved for what they do amiss, but it must not be done
with rudeness and insolence. David did indeed need to be roused and
alarmed; and Joab thought it no time to dally with him. If superiors do
that which is foolish, they must neither think it strange nor take it
ill if their inferiors tell them of it, perhaps too bluntly. 1. Joab
magnifies the services of David's soldiers: "This day they have saved
thy life, and therefore deserve to be taken notice of, and have reason
to resent it if they be not." It is implied that Absalom, whom he
honoured with his tears, sought his ruin and the ruin of his family,
while those whom by his tears he puts a slight upon were such as
preserved from ruin him and all that was dear to him. Great mischiefs
have arisen to princes from the contempt of great merits. 2. He
aggravates the discouragement David had given them: "Thou hast shamed
their faces; for, while they have shown such a value for thy life, thou
hast shown no value for theirs, but preferrest a spoiled wicked youth, a
false traitor to his king and country, whom we are happily rid of,
before all thy wise counsellors, brave commanders, and loyal subjects.
What can be more absurd than to love thy enemies and hate thy friends?"
3. He advises him to present himself immediately at the head of his
troops, to smile upon them, welcome them home, congratulate their
success, and return them thanks for their services. Even those that may
be commanded yet expect to be thanked when they do well, and ought to
be. 4. He threatens him with another rebellion if he would not do this,
intimating that rather than serve so ungrateful a prince he himself
would head a revolt from him, and then (so confident is Joab of his own
interest in the people) "there will not tarry with thee one man. If I
go, they will go. Thou hast now nothing to mourn for: but, if thou
persist, I will give thee something to mourn for (as Josephus expresses
it) with a true and more bitter mourning."

III\. How prudently and mildly David took the reproof and counsel given
him, [Sa2 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#008.md). He shook off his
grief, anointed his head, and washed his face, that he might not appear
unto men to mourn, and then made his appearance in public in the gate,
which was as the guild-hall of the city. Hither the people flocked to
him to congratulate his and their safety, and all was well. Note, When
we are convinced of a fault, we must amend, though we are told of it by
our inferiors, and indecently, or in heat and passion.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 19:9</span></span>

It is strange that David did not immediately upon the defeat and
dispersion of Absalom's forces march with all expedition back to
Jerusalem, to regain the possession of his capital city, while the
rebels were in confusion and before they could rally again. What
occasion was there to bring him back? Could not he himself go back with
the victorious army he had with him in Gilead? He could, no doubt; but,
1. He would go back as a prince, with the consent and unanimous
approbation of the people, and not as a conqueror forcing his way: he
would restore their liberties, and not take occasion to seize them, or
encroach upon them. 2. He would go back in peace and safety, and be sure
that he should meet with no difficulty or opposition in his return, and
therefore would be satisfied that the people were well-affected to have
him before he would stir. 3. He would go back in honour, and like
himself, and therefore would go back, not at the head of his forces, but
in the arms of his subjects; for the prince that has wisdom and goodness
enough to make himself his people's darling, without doubt, looks
greater and makes a much better figure than the prince that has strength
enough to make himself his people's terror. It is resolved therefore
that David must be brought back to Jerusalem his own city, and his own
house there, with some ceremony, and here we have that matter concerted.

I. The men of Israel (that is, the ten tribes) were the first that
talked of it, [Sa2 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#009.md), [Sa2
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#010.md). The people were at strife about
it; it was the great subject of discourse and dispute throughout all the
country. Some perhaps opposed it: "Let him either come back himself or
stay where he is;" others appeared zealous for it, and reasoned as
follows here, to further the design, 1. That David had formerly helped
them, had fought their battles, subdued their enemies, and done them
much service, and therefore it was a shame that he should continue
banished from their country who had been so great a benefactor to it.
Note, Good services done to the public, though they may be forgotten for
a while, yet will be remembered again when men come to their right
minds. 2. That Absalom had now disappointed them. "We were foolishly
sick of the cedar, and chose the branch to reign over us; but we have
had enough of him: he is consumed, and we narrowly escaped being
consumed with him. Let us therefore return to our allegiance, and think
of bringing the king back." Perhaps this was all the strife among them,
not a dispute whether the king should be brought back or no (all agreed
it was to be done), but whose fault is was that it was not done. As is
usual in such cases, every one justified himself and blamed his
neighbour. The people laid the fault on the elders, and the elders on
the people, and one tribe upon another. Mutual excitements to the doing
of a good work are laudable, but not mutual accusations for the not
doing of it; for usually when public services are neglected all sides
must share in the blame; every one might do more than he does, in the
reformation of manners, the healing of divisions, and the like.

II\. The men of Judah, by David's contrivance, were the first that did
it. It is strange that they, being David's own tribe, were not so
forward as the rest. David had intelligence of the good disposition of
all the rest towards him, but nothing from Judah, though he had always
been particularly careful of them. But we do not always find the most
kindness from those from whom we have most reason to expect it. Yet
David would not return till he knew the sense of his own tribe. Judah
was his lawgiver, [Psa 60:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#007.md). That his
way home might be the more clear, 1. He employed Zadok and Abiathar, the
two chief priests, to treat with the elders of Judah, and to excite them
to give the king an invitation back to his house, even to his house,
which was the glory of their tribe, [Sa2
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#011.md), [Sa2
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#012.md). No men more proper to negociate
this affair than the two priests, who were firm to David's interest,
were prudent men, and had great influence with the people. Perhaps the
men of Judah were remiss and careless, and did it not, because nobody
put them on to do it, and then it was proper to stir them up to it. Many
will follow in a good work who will not lead: it is a pity that they
should continue idle for want of being spoken to. Or perhaps they were
so sensible of the greatness of the provocation they had given to David,
by joining with Absalom, that they were afraid to bring him back,
despairing of his favour; he therefore warrants his agents to assure
them of it, with this reason: "You are my brethren, my bone and my
flesh, and therefore I cannot be severe with you." The Son of David has
been pleased to call us brethren, his bone and his flesh, which
encourages us to hope that we shall find favour with him. Or perhaps
they were willing to see what the rest of the tribes would do before
they stirred, with which they are here upbraided: "The speech of all
Israel has come to the king to invite him back, and shall Judah be the
last, that should have been the first? Where is now the celebrated
bravery of that royal tribe? Where is its loyalty?" Note, We should be
stirred up to that which is great and good by the examples both of our
ancestors and of our neighbours, and by the consideration of our rank.
Let not the first in dignity be last in duty. 2. He particularly courted
into his interest Amasa, who had been Absalom's general, but was his own
nephew as well as Joab, [Sa2 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#013.md). He
owns him for his kinsman, and promises him that, if he will appear for
him now, he will make him captain-general of all his forces in the room
of Joab, will not only pardon him (which, it may be, Amasa questioned),
but prefer him. Sometimes there is nothing lost in purchasing the
friendship of one that has been an enemy. Amasa's interest might do
David good service at this juncture. But, if David did wisely for
himself in designating Amasa for this post (Joab having now grown
intolerably haughty), he did not do kindly by Amasa in letting his
design be known, for it occasioned his death by Joab's hand, [Sa2
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#010.md). 3. The point was hereby gained.
He bowed the heart of the men of Judah to pass a vote, nemine
contradicente - unanimously, for the recall of the king, [Sa2
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#014.md). God's providence, by the
priests' persuasions and Amasa's interest, brought them to this resolve.
David stirred not till he received this invitation, and then he came as
far back as Jordan, at which river they were to meet him, [Sa2
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#015.md). Our Lord Jesus will rule in
those that invite him to the throne in their hearts and not till he be
invited. He first bows the heart and makes it willing in the day of his
power, and then rules in the midst of his enemies, [Psa
110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002.md), [Psa
110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 19:16</span></span>

Perhaps Jordan was never passed with so much solemnity, nor with so many
remarkable occurrences, as it was now, since Israel passed it under
Joshua. David, in his afflictive flight, remembered God particularly
from the land of Jordan ([Psa 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006).md),
and now that land, more than any other, was graced with the glories of
his return. David's soldiers furnished themselves with accommodations
for their passage over this river, but, for his own family, a ferry-boat
was sent on purpose, [Sa2 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#018.md). A
fleet of boats, say some; a bridge of boats was made, say others; the
best convenience they had to serve him with. Two remarkable persons met
him on the banks of Jordan, both of whom had abused him wretchedly when
he was in his flight.

I. Ziba, who had abused him with his fair tongue, and by accusing his
master, had obtained from the king a grant of his estate, [Sa2
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#004.md). A greater abuse he could not
have done him, than, by imposing upon his credulity, to draw him in to
do a thing so unkind to the son of his friend Jonathan. He comes now,
with a retinue of sons and servants, to meet the king ([Sa2
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#017).md), that he may obtain the king's
favour, and so come off the better when Mephibosheth shall shortly
undeceive him, and clear himself, [Sa2
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#026.md).

II\. Shimei, who had abused him with his foul tongue, railed at him, and
cursed him, [Sa2 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#005.md). If David had
been defeated, no doubt he would have continued to trample upon him, and
have gloried in what he had done; but now that he sees him coming home
in triumph, and returning to his throne, he thinks it his interest to
make his peace with him. Those who now slight and abuse the Son of David
would be glad to make their peace too when he shall come in his glory;
but it will be too late. Shimei, to recommend himself to the king, 1.
Came with good company, with the men of Judah, as one in their interest.
2. He brought a regiment of the men of Benjamin with him, 1000, of which
perhaps he was chiliarch, or commander-in-chief, offering his own and
their service to the king; or perhaps they were volunteers, whom by his
interest he had got together to meet the king, which was the more
obliging because of all the tribes of Israel there were none, except
these and Judah, that appeared to pay him this respect. 3. What he did
he hastened to do; he lost no time. Agree with thy adversary quickly,
while thou art in the way. Here is, (1.) The criminal's submission ([Sa2
19:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#018).md): He fell down before the
king, as a penitent, as a supplicant; and, that he might be thought
sincere, he did it publicly before all David's servants, and his friends
the men of Judah, yea, and before his own thousand. The offence was
public, therefore the submission ought to be so. He owns his crime: Thy
servant doth know that I have sinned. He aggravates it: I did
perversely. He begs the king's pardon: Let not the king impute iniquity
to thy servant, that is, deal with me as I deserve. He intimates that it
was below the king's great and generous mind to take it to his heart;
and pleads his early return to his allegiance, that he was the first of
all the house of Joseph (that is, of Israel, who in the beginning of
David's reign had distinguished themselves from Judah by their adherence
to Ishbosheth, [Sa2 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#010).md) that came to
meet the king. He came first, that by his example of duty the rest might
be induced, and by his experience of the king's clemency the rest might
be encouraged to follow. (2.) A motion made for judgment against him
([Sa2 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#021).md): "Shall not Shimei be put
to death as a traitor? Let him, of all men, be made an example." This
motion was made by Abishai, who would have ventured his life to have
been the death of Shimei when he was cursing, [Sa2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#009.md). David did not think fit to have
it done then, because his judicial power was cut short; but, now that it
was restored, why should not the law have its course? Abishai herein
consulted what he supposed to be David's feelings more than his true
interest. Princes have need to arm themselves against temptations to
severity. (3.) His discharge by the king's order, [Sa2
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#022.md), [Sa2
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#023.md). He rejected Abishai's motion
with displeasure: What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? The
less we have to do with those who are of an angry revengeful spirit, and
who put us upon doing what is harsh and rigorous, the better. He looks
upon these prosecutors as adversaries to him, though they pretended
friendship and zeal for his honour. Those who advise us to what is wrong
are really Satans, adversaries to us. \[1.\] They were adversaries to
his inclination, which was to clemency. He knew that he was this day
king in Israel, restored to, and re-established in, his kingdom, and
therefore his honour inclined him to forgive. It is the glory of kings
to forgive those that humble and surrender themselves: Satis est
prostrasse leoni - it suffices the lion that he has laid his victim
prostrate. His joy inclined him to forgive. The pleasantness of his
spirit on this great occasion forbade the entrance of any thing that was
sour and peevish: joyful days should be forgiving days. Yet this was not
all; his experience of God's mercy in restoring him to his kingdom, his
exclusion from which he attributed to his sin, inclined him to show
mercy to Shimei. Those that are forgiven must forgive. David had
severely revenged the abuses done to his ambassadors by the Ammonites
([Sa2 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#031).md), but easily passes by the
abuse done to himself by an Israelite. That was an affront to Israel in
general, and touched the honour of his crown and kingdom; this was
purely personal, and therefore (according to the usual disposition of
good men) he could the more easily forgive it. \[2.\] They were
adversaries to his interest. If he should put to death Shimei, who
cursed him, those would expect the same fate who had taken up arms and
actually levied war against him, which would drive them from him, while
he was endeavouring to draw them to him. Acts of severity are seldom
acts of policy. The throne is established by mercy. Shimei, hereupon,
had his pardon signed and sealed with an oath, yet being bound, no
doubt, to his good behaviour, and liable to be prosecuted if he
afterwards misbehaved; and thus he was reserved to be, in due time, as
much a monument of the justice of the government as he was now of its
clemency, and in both of its prudence.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 19:24</span></span>

The day of David's return was a day of bringing to remembrance, a day of
account, in which what had passed in his flight was called over again;
among other things, after the case of Shimei, that of Mephibosheth comes
to be enquired into, and he himself brings it on.

I. He went down in the crowd to meet the king ([Sa2
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#024).md), and as a proof of the
sincerity of his joy in the king's return, we are here told what a true
mourner he was for the king's banishment. During that melancholy time,
when one of the greatest glories of Israel had departed, Mephibosheth
continued in a very melancholy state. He was never trimmed, nor put on
clean linen, but wholly neglected himself, as one abandoned to grief for
the king's affliction and the kingdom's misery. In times of public
calamity we ought to abridge our enjoyments in the delights of sense, in
conformity to the season. There are times when God calls to weeping and
mourning, and we must comply with the call.

II\. When the king came to Jerusalem (since he could not sooner have an
opportunity) he made his appearance before him ([Sa2
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#025).md); and when the king asked him
why he, being one of his family, had staid behind, and not accompanied
him in his exile, he opened his case fully to the king. 1. He complained
of Ziba, his servant who should have been his friend, but had been in
two ways his enemy; for, first, he had hindered him from going along
with the king, by taking the ass himself which he was ordered to make
ready for his master ([Sa2 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#026).md),
basely taking advantage of his lameness and his inability to help
himself; and, secondly, he had accused him to David of a design to usurp
the government, [Sa2 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#027.md). How much
mischief is it in the power of a wicked servant to do to the best
master! 2. He gratefully acknowledged the king's great kindness to him
when he and all his father's house lay at the king's mercy, [Sa2
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#028.md). When he might justly have been
dealt with as a rebel, he was treated as a friend, as a child: Thou
didst set thy servant among those that did eat at thy own table. This
shows that Ziba's suggestion was improbable; for could Mephibosheth be
so foolish as to aim higher when he lived so easily, so happily as he
did? And could he be so very disingenuous as to design any harm to
David, of whose great kindness to him he was thus sensible? (3.) He
referred his cause to the king's pleasure (Do what is good in thy eyes
with me and my estate), depending on the king's wisdom, and his ability
to discern between truth and falsehood (My lord the king is as an angel
from God), and disclaiming all pretensions of his own merit: "So much
kindness I have received above what I deserved, and what right have I to
cry any more unto the king? Why should I trouble the king with my
complaints when I have already been so troublesome to him? Why should I
think any thing hard that is put upon me when I hitherto been so kindly
treated?" We were all as dead men before God; yet he has not only spared
us, but taken us to sit at his table. How little reason then have we to
complain of any trouble we are in, and how much reason to take all well
that God does!

III\. David hereupon recalls the sequestration of Mephibosheth's estate;
being deceived in his grant, he revokes it, and confirms his former
settlement of it: "I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land ([Sa2
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#029).md), that is, Let it be as I first
ordered it ([Sa2 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#010).md); the property
shall still be vested in thee, but Ziba shall have occupancy: he shall
till the land, paying thee a rent." Thus Mephibosheth is where he was;
no harm is done, only Ziba goes away unpunished for his false and
malicious information against his master. David either feared him too
much, or loved him too well, to do justice upon him according to that
law, [Deu 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#018.md), [Deu
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#019.md); and he was now in the humour of
forgiving and resolved to make every body easy.

IV\. Mephibosheth drowns all he cares about his estate in his joy for
the king's return ([Sa2 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#030).md): "Yea,
let him take all, the presence and favour of the king shall be to me
instead of all." A good man can contentedly bear his own private losses
and disappointments, while he see Israel in peace, and the throne of the
Son of David exalted and established. Let Ziba take all, so that David
may be in peace.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa2 19:31</span></span>

David had already graced the triumphs of his restoration with the
generous remission of the injuries that had been done to him; we have
him here gracing them with a no less generous reward of the kindnesses
that had been shown to him. Barzillai, the Gileadite, who had a noble
seat at Rogelim, not far from Mahanaim, was the man who, of all the
nobility and gentry of that country, had been most kind to David in his
distress. If Absalom had prevailed, it is likely he would have suffered
for his loyalty; but now he and his shall be no losers by it. Here is,

I. Barzillai's great respect to David, not only as a good man, but as
his righteous sovereign: He provided him with much sustenance, for
himself and his family, while he lay at Mahanaim, [Sa2
19:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#032.md). God had given him a large
estate, for he was a very great man, and, it seems, he had a large heart
to do good with it: what else but that is a large estate good for? To
reduced greatness generosity obliges us, and to oppressed goodness piety
obliges us, to be in a particular manner kind, to the utmost of our
power. Barzillai, to show that he was not weary of David, though he was
so great a charge to him, attended him to Jordan, and went over with
him, [Sa2 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#031.md). Let subjects learn
hence to render tribute to whom tribute is due and honour to whom
honour, [Rom 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#007.md).

II\. The kind invitation David gave to him to court ([Sa2
19:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#033).md): Come thou over with me. He
invited him, 1. That he might have the pleasure of his company and the
benefit of his counsel; for we may suppose that he was very wise and
good, as well as very rich, otherwise he would not have been called here
a very great man; for it is what a man is, more than what he has, that
renders him truly great. 2. That he might have an opportunity of
returning his kindness: "I will feed thee with me; thou shalt fare as
sumptuously as I fare, and this at Jerusalem, the royal and holy city."
David did not take Barzillai's kindness to him as a debt (he was not one
of those arbitrary princes who think that whatever their subjects have
is theirs when they please), but accepted it and rewarded it as a
favour. We must always study to be grateful to our friends, especially
to those who have helped us in distress.

III\. Barzillai's reply to this invitation, wherein,

1\. He admires the king's generosity in making him this offer, lessening
his service, and magnifying the king's return for it: Why should the
king recompense it with such a reward? [Sa2
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#036.md). Will the master thank that
servant who only does what was his duty to do? He though he had done
himself honour enough in doing the king any service. Thus, when the
saints shall be called to inherit the kingdom in consideration of what
they have done for Christ in this world, they will be amazed at the
disproportion between the service and the recompence. [Mat
25:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#037.md), Lord, when saw we thee hungry,
and fed thee?

2\. He declines accepting the invitation. He begs his majesty's pardon
for refusing so generous an offer: he should think himself very happy in
being near the king, but, (1.) He is old, and unfit to remove at all,
especially to court. He is old, and unfit for the business of the court:
"Why should I go up with the king to Jerusalem? I can do him no service
there, in the council, the camp, the treasury, or the courts of justice;
for how long have I to live? [Sa2
19:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#034.md). Shall I think of going into
business, now that I am going out of this world?" He is old and unfit
for the diversions of the court, which will be ill-bestowed, and even
thrown away, upon one that can relish them so little, [Sa2
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#035.md). As it was in Moses's time, so
it was in barzillai's and it is not worse now, that, if men be so strong
that they come to fourscore years, their strength then is labour and
sorrow, [Psa 90:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#010.md). These were then,
and are still, years of which men say they have no pleasure in them,
[Ecc 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#001.md). Dainties are insipid when
desire fails, and songs to the aged ear are little better than those
sung to a heavy heart, very disagreeable: how should they be otherwise
when the daughters of music are brought low? Let those that are old
learn of Barzillai to be dead to the delights of sense; let grace second
nature, and make a virtue of the necessity. Nay, Barzillai, being old,
thinks he shall be a burden to the king, rather than any credit to him;
and a good man would not go any where to be burdensome, or, if he must
be so, will rather be so to his own house than to another's. (2.) He is
dying, and must begin to think of his long journey, his removal out of
the world, [Sa2 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#037.md). It is good for
us all, but it especially becomes old people to think and speak much of
dying. "Talk of going to court!" says Barzillai; "Let me go home and die
in my own city, the place of my father's sepulchre; let me die by the
grave of my father, that my bones may be quietly carried to the place of
their rest. The grave is ready for me, let me go and get ready for it,
go and die in my nest."

3\. He desires the king to be kind to his son Chimham: Let him go over
with my lord the king, and have preferment at court. What favour is done
to him Barzillai will take as done to himself. Those that are old must
not grudge young people those delights which they themselves are past
the enjoyment of, nor confine them to their retirements. Barzillai will
go back himself, but he will not make Chimham go back with him; though
he could ill spare Chimham, yet, thinking it would gratify and advance
him, he is willing to do it.

IV\. David's farewell to Barzillai. 1. He sends him back into his
country with a kiss and a blessing ([Sa2
19:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#039).md), signifying that in gratitude
for his kindnesses he would love him and pray for him, and with a
promise that whatever request he should at any time make to him he would
be ready to oblige him ([Sa2 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#038).md):
Whatsoever thou shalt think of, when thou comest home, to ask of me,
that will I do for thee. What is the chief excellency of power but this,
that it gives men a capacity of doing the more good? 2. He takes Chimham
forward with him, and leaves it to Barzillai to choose him his
preferment. I will do to him what shall seem good to thee, [Sa2
19:38](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#038.md). And, it should seem, Barzillai,
who had experienced the innocency and safety of retirement, begged a
country seat for him near Jerusalem, but not in it; for, long after, we
read of a place near Beth-lehem, David's city, which is called the
habitation of Chimham, allotted to him, probably, not out of the
crown-lands or the forfeited estates, but out of David's paternal
estate.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:40](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">sa2 19:40</span></span>

David came over Jordan attended and assisted only by the men of Judah;
but when he had advanced as far as Gilgal, the first stage on this side
Jordan, half the people of Israel (that is, of their elders and great
men) had come to wait upon him, to kiss his hand, and congratulate him
on his return, but found they came too late to witness the solemnity of
his first entrance. This put them out of humour, and occasioned a
quarrel between them and the men of Judah, which was a damp to the joy
of the day, and the beginning of further mischief. Here is, 1. The
complaint which the men of Israel brought to the king against the men of
Judah ([Sa2 19:41](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#041).md), that they had
performed the ceremony of bringing the king over Jordan, and not given
them notice, that they might have come to join in it. This reflected
upon them, as if they were not so well affected to the king and his
restoration as the men of Judah were, whereas the king himself knew that
they had spoken of it before the men of Judah thought of it, [Sa2
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#011.md). It seemed likewise as if they
intended to monopolize the king's favours when he had come back, and to
be looked upon as his only friends. See what mischief comes from pride
and jealousy. 2. The excuse which the men of Judah made for themselves,
[Sa2 19:42](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#042). (1..md) They plead relations
to the king: "He is near of kin to us, and therefore in a matter of mere
ceremony, as this was, we may claim precedency. It was into our country
that he was to be brought, and therefore who so fit as we to bring him?"
(2.) They deny the insinuated charge of self-seeking in what they had
done: "Have we eaten at all of the king's cost? No, we have all borne
our own charges. Hath he given us any gift? No, we have no design to
engross the advantages of his return; you have come time enough to share
in them." Too many that attend princes do so only for what they can get.
3. The men of Israel's vindication of their charge, [Sa2
19:43](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#043.md). They pleaded, "We have ten
parts in the king" (Judah having Simeon only, whose lot lay within his,
to join with him), "and therefore it is a slight upon us that our advice
was not asked about bringing back the king." See how uncertain the
multitude is. They were lately striving against the king, to drive him
out; now they are striving about him, which shall honour him most. A
good man and a good cause will thus recover their credit and interest,
though, for a time, they may seem to have lost them. See what is
commonly the origin of strife, nothing so much as impatience of contempt
or the least seeming slight. The men of Judah would have done better if
they had taken their brethren's advice and assistance; but, since they
did not, why should the men of Israel be so grievously offended? If a
good work be done, and well done, let us not be displeased, nor the work
disparaged, though we had no hand in it. 4. The scripture takes notice,
by way of blame, which of the contending parties managed the cause with
most passion: The words of the men of Judah were fiercer than those of
the men of Israel. Though we have right and reason on our side, yet, if
we express ourselves with fierceness, God takes notice of it and is much
displeased with it.
