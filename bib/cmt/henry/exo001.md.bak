### [Exodus Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

We have here, I. God's kindness to Israel, in multiplying them
exceedingly ([Exo 1:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001).md). II. The
Egyptians' wickedness to them, 1. Oppressing and enslaving them ([Exo
1:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#008).md). 2. Murdering their children
([Exo 1:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#015).md). Thus whom the court of
heaven blessed the country of Egypt cursed, and for that reason.

[Exodus 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 1:1</span></span>

In these verses we have, 1. A recital of the names of the twelve
patriarchs, as they are called, [Act
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#008.md). Their names are often repeated in
scripture, that they may not sound uncouth to us, as other hard names,
but that, by their occurring so frequently, they may become familiar to
us; and to show how precious God's spiritual Israel are to him, and how
much he delights in them. The account which was kept of the number of
Jacob's family, when they went down into Egypt; they were in all seventy
souls ([Exo 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#005).md). according to the
computation we had, [Gen 46:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#027.md). This
was just the number of the nations by which the earth was peopled,
according to the account given, Gen. 10. For when the Most High
separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to
the number of the children of Israel, as Moses observes, [Deu
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008.md). Notice is here taken of this
that their increase in Egypt might appear the more wonderful. Note, It
is good for those whose latter end greatly increases often to remember
how small their beginning was, [Job
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#007.md). 3. The death of Joseph, [Exo
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#006.md). All that generation by degrees
wore off. Perhaps all Jacob's sons died much about the same time; for
there was not more than seven years' difference in age between the
eldest and the youngest of them, except Benjamin; and, when death comes
into a family, sometimes it makes a full end in a little time. When
Joseph, the stay of the family, died, the rest went off apace. Note, We
must look upon ourselves and our brethren, and all we converse with, as
dying and hastening out of the world. This generation passeth away, as
that did which went before. 4. The strange increase of Israel in Egypt,
[Exo 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#007.md). Here are four words used to
express it: They were fruitful, and increased abundantly, like fishes or
insects, so that they multiplied; and, being generally healthful and
strong, they waxed exceedingly mighty, so that they began almost to
outnumber the natives, for the land was in all places filled with them,
at least Goshen, their own allotment. Observe, (1.) Though, no doubt,
they increased considerably before, yet, it should seem, it was not till
after the death of Joseph that it began to be taken notice of as
extraordinary. Thus, when they lost the benefit of his protection, God
made their numbers their defence, and they became better able than they
had been to shift for themselves. If God continue our friends and
relations to us while we most need them, and remove them when they can
be better spared, let us own that he is wise, and not complain that he
is hard upon us. After the death of Christ, our Joseph, his gospel
Israel began most remarkably to increase: and his death had an influence
upon it; it was like the sowing of a corn of wheat, which, if it die,
bringeth forth much fruit, [Joh 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024.md).
(2.) This wonderful increase was the fulfillment of the promise long
before made unto the fathers. From the call of Abraham, when God first
told him he would make of him a great nation, to the deliverance of his
seed out of Egypt, it was 430 years, during the first 215 of which they
were increased but to seventy, but, in the latter half, those seventy
multiplied to 600,000 fighting men. Note, \[1.\] Sometimes God's
providences may seem for a great while to thwart his promises, and to go
counter to them, that his people's faith may be tried, and his own power
the more magnified. \[2.\] Though the performance of God's promises is
sometimes slow, yet it is always sure; at the end it shall speak, and
not lie, [Hab 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003.md).

[Exodus 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 1:8</span></span>

The land of Egypt here, at length, becomes to Israel a house of bondage,
though hitherto it had been a happy shelter and settlement for them.
Note, The place of our satisfaction may soon become the place of our
affliction, and that may prove the greatest cross to us of which we
said, This same shall comfort us. Those may prove our sworn enemies
whose parents were our faithful friends; nay, the same persons that
loved us may possibly turn to hate us: therefore cease from man, and say
not concerning any place on this side heaven, This is my rest for ever.
Observe here,

I. The obligations they lay under to Israel upon Joseph's account were
forgotten: There arose a new king, after several successions in Joseph's
time, who knew not Joseph, [Exo 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#008.md).
All that knew him loved him, and were kind to his relations for his
sake; but when he was dead he was soon forgotten, and the remembrance of
the good offices he had done was either not retained or not regarded,
nor had it any influence upon their councils. Note, the best and the
most useful and acceptable services done to men are seldom remembered,
so as to be recompensed to those that did them, in the notice taken
either of their memory, or of their posterity, after their death, [Ecc
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#005.md), [Ecc
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#015.md). Therefore our great care should
be to serve God, and please him, who is not unrighteous, whatever men
are, to forget our work and labour of love, [Heb
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#010.md). If we work for men only, our
works, at furthest, will die with us; if for God, they will follow us,
[Rev 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013.md). This king of Egypt knew
not Joseph; and after him arose one that had the impudence to say, I
know not the Lord, [Rev 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#002.md). Note,
Those that are unmindful of their other benefactors, it is to be feared,
will forget the supreme benefactor, [Jo1
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#020.md).

II\. Reasons of state were suggested for their dealing hardly with
Israel, [Exo 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#009.md), [Exo
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#010.md). 1. They are represented as more
and mightier than the Egyptians; certainly they were not so, but the
king of Egypt, when he resolved to oppress them, would have them thought
so, and looked on as a formidable body. 2. Hence it is inferred that if
care were not taken to keep them under they would become dangerous to
the government, and in time of war would side with their enemies and
revolt from their allegiance to the crown of Egypt. Note, It has been
the policy of persecutors to represent God's Israel as a dangerous
people, hurtful to kings and provinces, not fit to be trusted, nay, not
fit to be tolerated, that they may have some pretence for the barbarous
treatment they design them, [Ezr 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#012.md),
etc.; [Est 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#008.md). Observe, The thing
they feared was lest they should get them up out of the land, probably
having heard them speak of the promise made to their fathers that they
should settle in Canaan. Note, The policies of the church's enemies aim
to defeat the promises of the church's God, but in vain; God's counsels
shall stand. 3. It is therefore proposed that a course be taken to
prevent their increase: Come on, let us deal wisely with them, lest they
multiply. Note, (1.) The growth of Israel is the grief of Egypt, and
that against which the powers and policies of hell are levelled. (2.)
When men deal wickedly, it is common for them to imagine that they deal
wisely; but the folly of sin will, at last, be manifested before all
men.

III\. The method they took to suppress them, and check their growth,
[Exo 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#011.md), [Exo
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#013.md), [Exo
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#014.md). The Israelites behaved
themselves so peaceably and inoffensively that they could not find any
occasion of making war upon them, and weakening them by that means: and
therefore, 1. They took care to keep them poor, by charging them with
heavy taxes, which, some think, is included in the burdens with which
they afflicted them. 2. By this means they took an effectual course to
make them slaves. The Israelites, it should seem, were much more
industrious laborious people than the Egyptians, and therefore Pharaoh
took care to find them work, both in building (they built him
treasure-cities), and in husbandry, even all manner of service in the
field: and this was exacted from them with the utmost rigour and
severity. Here are many expressions used, to affect us with the
condition of God's people. They had taskmasters set over them, who were
directed, not only to burden them, but, as much as might be, to afflict
them with their burdens, and contrive how to make them grievous. They
not only made them serve, which was sufficient for Pharaoh's profit, but
they made them serve with rigour, so that their lives became bitter to
them, intending hereby, (1.) To break their spirits, and rob them of
every thing in them that was ingenuous and generous. (2.) To ruin their
health and shorten their days, and so diminish their numbers. (3.) To
discourage them from marrying, since their children would be born to
slavery. (4.) To oblige them to desert the Hebrews, and incorporate
themselves with the Egyptians. Thus he hoped to cut off the name of
Israel, that it might be no more in remembrance. And it is to be feared
that the oppression they were under had this bad effect upon them, that
it brought over many of them to join with the Egyptians in their
idolatrous worship; for we read ([Jos
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#014).md) that they served other gods in
Egypt; and, though it is not mentioned here in this history, yet we find
([Eze 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#008).md) that God had threatened to
destroy them for it, even while they were in the land of Egypt: however,
they were kept a distinct body, unmingled with the Egyptians, and by
their other customs separated from them, which was the Lord's doing, and
marvellous.

IV\. The wonderful increase of the Israelites, notwithstanding the
oppressions they groaned under ([Exo
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#012).md): The more they afflicted them
the more they multiplied, sorely to the grief and vexation of the
Egyptians. Note, 1. Times of affliction have often been the church's
growing times, Sub pondere crescit - Being pressed, it grows.
Christianity spread most when it was persecuted: the blood of the
martyrs was the seed of the church. 2. Those that take counsel against
the Lord and his Israel do but imagine a vain thing ([Psa
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001).md), and create so much the greater
vexation to themselves: hell and earth cannot diminish those whom Heaven
will increase.

[Exodus 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 1:15</span></span>

The Egyptians' indignation at Israel's increase, notwithstanding the
many hardships they put upon them, drove them at length to the most
barbarous and inhuman methods of suppressing them, by the murder of
their children. It was strange that they did not rather pick quarrels
with the grown men, against whom they might perhaps find some occasion:
to be thus bloody towards the infants, whom all must own to be
innocents, was a sin which they had to cloak for. Note, 1. There is more
cruelty in the corrupt heart of man than one would imagine, [Rom
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#015.md), [Rom
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#016.md). The enmity that is in the seed
of the serpent against the seed of the woman divests men of humanity
itself, and makes them forget all pity. One would not think it possible
that ever men should be so barbarous and blood-thirsty as the
persecutors of God's people have been, [Rev
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#006.md). 2. Even confessed innocence is
no defence against the old enmity. What blood so guiltless as that of a
child new-born? Yet that is prodigally shed like water, and sucked with
delight like milk or honey. Pharaoh and Herod sufficiently proved
themselves agents for that great red dragon, who stood to devour the
man-child as soon as it was born, [Rev
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#003.md), [Rev
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#004.md). Pilate delivered Christ to be
crucified, after he had confessed that he found no fault in him. It is
well for us that, though man can kill the body, this is all he can do.
Two bloody edicts are here signed for the destruction of all the male
children that were born to the Hebrews.

I. The midwives were commanded to murder them. Observe, 1. The orders
given them, [Exo 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#015.md), [Exo
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#016.md). It added much to the barbarity
of the intended executions that the midwives were appointed to be the
executioners; for it was to make them, not only bloody, but perfidious,
and to oblige them to betray a trust, and to destroy those whom they
undertook to save and help. Could he think that their sex would admit
such cruelty, and their employment such base treachery? Note, Those who
are themselves barbarous think to find, or make, others as barbarous.
Pharaoh's project was secretly to engage the midwives to stifle the
men-children as soon as they were born, and then to lay it upon the
difficulty of the birth, or some mischance common in that case, [Job
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#011.md). The two midwives he tampered
with in order hereunto are here named; and perhaps, at this time, which
was above eighty years before their going out of Egypt, those two might
suffice for all the Hebrew women, at least so many of them as lay near
the court, as it is plain by [Exo 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#005.md),
[Exo 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#006.md), many of them did, and of
them he was most jealous. They are called Hebrew midwives, probably not
because they were themselves Hebrews (for surely Pharaoh could never
expect they should be so barbarous to those of their own nation), but
because they were generally made use of by the Hebrews; and, being
Egyptians, he hoped to prevail with them. 2. Their pious disobedience to
this impious command, [Exo 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#017.md). They
feared God, regarded his law, and dreaded his wrath more than Pharaoh's
and therefore saved the men-children alive. Note, If men's commands be
any way contrary to the commands of God, we must obey God and not man,
[Act 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#019.md); [Act
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029.md). No power on earth can warrant
us, much less oblige us, to sin against God, our chief Lord. Again,
Where the fear of God rules in the heart, it will preserve it from the
snare which the inordinate fear of man brings. 3. Their justifying
themselves in this disobedience, when they were charged with it as a
crime, [Exo 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#018.md). They gave a reason
for it, which, it seems, God's gracious promise furnished them with -
that they came too late to do it, for generally the children were born
before they came, [Exo 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#019.md). I see no
reason we have to doubt the truth of this; it is plain that the Hebrews
were now under an extraordinary blessing of increase, which may well be
supposed to have this effect, that the women had very quick and easy
labour, and, the mothers and children being both lively, they seldom
needed the help of midwives: this these midwives took notice of, and,
concluding it to the finger of God, were thereby emboldened to disobey
the king, in favour of those whom Heaven thus favoured, and with this
justified themselves before Pharaoh, when he called them to an account
for it. Some of the ancient Jews expound it thus, Ere the midwife comes
to them they pray to their Father in heaven, and he answereth them, and
they do bring forth. Note, God is a readier help to his people in
distress than any other helpers are, and often anticipates them with the
blessings of his goodness; such deliverances lay them under peculiarly
strong obligations. 4. The recompence God gave them for their tenderness
towards his people: He dealt well with them, [Exo
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#020.md). Note, God will be behind-hand
with none for any kindness done to his people, taking it as done to
himself. In particular, he made them houses ([Exo
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#021).md), built them up into families,
blessed their children, and prospered them in all they did. Note, The
services done for God's Israel are often repaid in kind. The midwives
kept up the Israelites' houses, and, in recompence for it, God made them
houses. Observe, The recompence has relation to the principle upon which
they went: Because they feared God, he made them houses. Note, Religion
and piety are good friends to outward prosperity: the fear of God in a
house will help to build it up and establish it. Dr. Lightfoot's notion
of it is, That, for their piety, they were married to Israelites, and
Hebrew families were built up by them.

II\. When this project did not take effect, Pharaoh gave public orders
to all his people to drown all the male children of the Hebrews, [Exo
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#022.md). We may suppose it was made
highly penal for any to know of the birth of a son to an Israelite, and
not to give information to those who were appointed to throw him into
the river. Note, The enemies of the church have been restless in their
endeavours to wear out the saints of the Most High, [Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md). But he that sits in heaven shall
laugh at them. See [Psa 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004.md).
