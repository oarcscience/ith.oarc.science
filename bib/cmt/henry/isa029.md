### [Isaiah Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 29:0</span></span>

This woe to Ariel, which we have in this chapter, is the same with the
"burden of the valley of vision" ([Isa
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#001)), and (it is very probable.md)
points at the same event - the besieging of Jerusalem by the Assyrian
army, which was cut off there by an angel; yet it is applicable to the
destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, and its last desolations by
the Romans. Here is, I. The event itself foretold, that Jerusalem should
be greatly distressed ([Isa 29:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md),
[Isa 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006).md), but that their enemies,
who distressed them, should be baffled and defeated ([Isa
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#005.md), [Isa
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#007.md), [Isa
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#008).md). II. A reproof to three sorts of
sinners: - 1. Those that were stupid, and regardless of the warnings
which the prophet gave them ([Isa
29:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#009).md). 2. Those that were formal
and hypocritical in their religious performances ([Isa
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013.md), [Isa
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#014).md). 3. Those politicians that
atheistically and profanely despised God's providence, and set up their
own projects in competition with it ([Isa
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#015.md), [Isa
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#016).md). III. Precious promises of
grace and mercy to a distinguished remnant whom God would sanctify, and
in whom he would be sanctified, when their enemies and persecutors
should be cut off ([Isa 29:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017).md).

[Isaiah 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 29:1</span></span>

That it is Jerusalem which is here called Ariel is agreed, for that was
the city where David dwelt; that part of it which was called Zion was in
a particular manner the city of David, in which both the temple and the
palace were. But why it is so called is very uncertain: probably the
name and the reason were then well known. Cities, as well as persons,
get surnames and nicknames. Ariel signifies the lion of God, or the
strong lion: as the lion is king among beasts, so was Jerusalem among
the cities, giving law to all about her; it was the city of the great
King ([Psa 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001.md), [Psa
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002).md); it was the head-city of Judah,
who is called a lion's whelp ([Gen
49:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009).md) and whose ensign was a lion; and
he that is the lion of the tribe of Judah was the glory of it. Jerusalem
was a terror sometimes to the neighbouring nations, and, while she was a
righteous city, was bold as a lion. Some make Ariel to signify the altar
of burnt-offerings, which devoured the beasts offered in sacrifice as
the lion does his prey. Woe to that altar in the city where David dwelt;
that was destroyed with the temple by the Chaldeans. I rather take it as
a woe to Jerusalem, Jerusalem; it is repeated here, as it is [Mat
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md), that it might be the more
awakening. Here is,

I. The distress of Jerusalem foretold. Though Jerusalem be a strong
city, as a lion, though a holy city, as a lion of God, yet, if iniquity
be found there, woe be to it. It was the city where David dwelt; it was
he that brought that to it which was its glory, and which made it a type
of the gospel church, and his dwelling in it was typical of Christ's
residence in his church. This mentioned as an aggravation of Jerusalem's
sin, that in it were set both the testimony of Israel and the thrones of
the house of David. 1. Let Jerusalem know that her external performance
of religious services will not serve as an exemption from the judgments
of God ([Isa 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001).md): "Add year to year;
go on in the road of your annual feasts, let all your males appear there
three times a year before the Lord, and none empty, according to the law
and custom, and let them never miss any of these solemnities: let them
kill the sacrifices, as they used to do; but, as long as their lives are
unreformed and their hearts unhumbled, let them not think thus to pacify
an offended God and to turn away his wrath." Note, Hypocrites may be
found in a constant track of devout exercises, and treading around in
them, and with these they may flatter themselves, but can never please
God nor make their peace with him. 2. Let her know that God is coming
forth against her in displeasure, that she shall be visited of the Lord
of hosts ([Isa 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006).md); her sins shall
be enquired into and punished: God will reckon for them with terrible
judgments, with the frightful alarms and rueful desolations of war,
which shall be like thunder and earthquakes, storms and tempests, and
devouring fire, especially upon the account of the great noise. When a
foreign enemy was not in the borders, but in the bowels of their
country, roaring and ravaging, and laying all waste (especially such an
army as that of the Assyrians, whose commanders being so very insolent,
as appears by the conduct of Rabshakeh, the common soldiers, no doubt,
were much more rude), they might see the Lord of those hosts visiting
them with thunder and storm. Yet, this being here said to be a great
noise, perhaps it is intimated that they shall be worse frightened than
hurt. Particularly, (1.) Jerusalem shall be besieged, straitly besieged.
He does not say, I will destroy Ariel, but I will distress Ariel; and
she is therefore brought into distress, that, being thereby awakened to
repent and reform, she may not be brought to destruction. I will ([Isa
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#003).md) encamp against thee round about.
It was the enemy's army that encamped against it; but God says that he
will do it, for they are his hand, he does it by them. God had often and
long, by a host of angels, encamped for them round about them for their
protection and deliverance; but now he was turned to be their enemy and
fought against them. The siege laid against them was of his laying, and
the forts raised against them were of his raising. Note, When men fight
against us we must, in them, see God contending with us. (2.) She shall
be in grief to see the country laid waste and all the fenced cities of
Judah in the enemies' hand: There shall be heaviness and sorrow ([Isa
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#002).md), mourning and lamentation - so
these two words are sometimes rendered. Those that are most merry and
jovial are commonly, when they come to be in distress, most overwhelmed
with heaviness and sorrow; their laughter is then turned into mourning.
"All Jerusalem shall then be unto me as Ariel, as the altar, with fire
upon it and slain victims about it:" so it was when Jerusalem was
destroyed by the Chaldeans; and many, no doubt, were slain when it was
besieged by the Assyrians. "the whole city shall be an altar, in which
sinners, falling by the judgments that are abroad, shall be as victims
to divine justice." Or thus: - "There shall be heaviness and sorrow;
they shall repent, and reform, and return to God, and then it shall be
to me as Ariel. Jerusalem shall be like itself, shall become to me a
Jerusalem again, a holy city," [Isa
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#026). (3..md) She shall be humbled, and
mortified, and made submissive ([Isa
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#004).md): "Thou shalt be brought down
from the height of arrogancy and insolence to which thou hast arrived:
the proud looks and the proud language shall be brought down by one
humbling providence after another." Those that despise God's judgments
shall be humbled by them; for the proudest sinners shall either bend or
break before him. They had talked big, had lifted up the horn on high,
and had spoken with a stiff neck ([Psa
75:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#005).md); but now thou shalt speak out of
the ground, out of the dust, as one that has a familiar spirit,
whispering out of the dust. This intimates, \[1.\] That they should be
faint and feeble, not able to speak up, nor to say all they would say;
but as those who are sick, or whose spirits are ready to fail, their
speech shall be low and interrupted. \[2.\] That they should be fearful,
and in consternation, forced to speak low as being afraid lest their
enemies should overhear them and take advantage against them. \[3.\]
That they should be tame, and obliged to submit to the conquerors. When
Hezekiah submitted to the king of Assyria, saying, I have offended, that
which thou puttest on me I will bear ([Kg2
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014).md), then his speech was low, out
of the dust. God can make those to crouch that have been most daring,
and quite dispirit them.

II\. The destruction of Jerusalem's enemies is foretold, for the comfort
of all that were her friends and well-wishers in this distress ([Isa
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#005.md), [Isa
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#007).md): "Thou shalt be brought down
([Isa 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#004).md), to speak out of the dust;
so low thou shalt be reduced. But" (so it may be rendered) "the
multitude of thy strangers and thy terrible ones, the numerous armies of
the enemy, shall themselves be like small dust, not able to speak at
all, or as much as whisper, but as chaff that passes away. Thou shalt be
abased, but they shall be quite dispersed, smitten and slain after
another manner ([Isa 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#007).md); they shall
pass away, yea it shall be in an instant, suddenly: the enemy shall be
surprised with the destruction, and you with the salvation." The army of
the Assyrians was by an angel laid dead upon the spot, in an instant,
suddenly. Such will be the destruction of the enemies of the gospel
Jerusalem. In one hour shall their judgment come, [Rev
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#010.md). Again ([Isa
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006).md), "Thou shalt be visited, or (as
it used to be rendered) She shall be visited with thunder and a great
noise. Thou shalt be put into a fright which thou shalt soon recover.
But ([Isa 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#007).md) the multitude of the
nations that fight against her shall be as a dream of a night-vision;
they and their prosperity and success shall soon vanish past recall."
The multitude of the nations that fight against Zion shall be as a
hungry man who dreams that he eats, but still is hungry; that is, 1.
Whereas they hoped to make a prey of Jerusalem, and to enrich themselves
with the plunder of that opulent city, their hopes shall prove vain
dreams, with which their fancies may please and sport themselves for a
while, but they shall be disappointed. They fancied themselves masters
of Jerusalem, but shall never be so. 2. They themselves, and all their
pomp, and power, and prosperity, shall vanish like a dream when one
awakes, shall be of as little value and as short continuance. [Psa
73:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#020.md). He shall fly away as a dream
[Job 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#008.md). The army of Sennacherib
vanished and was gone quickly, though it had filled the country as a
dream fills a man's head, especially as a dream of meat fills the head
of him that went to bed hungry. Many understand these verses as part of
the threatening of wrath, when God comes to distress Jerusalem, and lay
siege to her. (1.) The multitude of her friends, whom she relies upon
for help shall do her no good; for, though they are terrible ones, they
shall be like the small dust, and shall pass away. (2.) The multitude of
her enemies shall never think they can do her mischief enough; but, when
they have devoured her much, still they shall be but like a man who
dreams he eats, hungry, and greedy to devour her more.

[Isaiah 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 29:9</span></span>

Here, I. The prophet stands amazed at the stupidity of the greatest part
of the Jewish nation. They had Levites, who taught the good knowledge of
the Lord and had encouragement from Hezekiah in doing so, [Ch2
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#022.md). They had prophets, who brought
them messages immediately from God, and signified to them what were the
causes and what would be the effects of God's displeasure against them.
Now, one would think, surely this great nation, that has all the
advantages of divine revelation, is a wise and understanding people,
[Deu 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#006.md). But, alas! it was quite
otherwise, [Isa 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#009.md). The prophet
addresses himself to the sober thinking part of them, calling upon them
to be affected with the general carelessness of their neighbours. It may
be read, "They delay, they put off, their repentance, but wonder you
that they should be so sottish. They sport themselves with their own
deceivings; they riot and revel; but do you cry out, lament their folly,
cry to God by prayer for them. The more insensible they are of the hand
of God gone out against them the more do you lay to heart these things."
Note, The security of sinners in their sinful way is just matter of
lamentation and wonder to all serious people, who should think
themselves concerned to pray for those that do not pray for themselves.
But what is the matter? What are we thus to wonder at? 1. We may well
wonder that the generality of the people should be so sottish and
brutish, and so infatuated, as if they were intoxicated: They are
drunken, but not with wine (not with wine only, though with that they
were often drunk), and they erred through wine, [Isa
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#007.md). They were drunk with the love of
pleasures, with prejudices against religion, and with the corrupt
principles they had imbibed. Like drunken men, they know not what they
do or say, nor whither they go. They are not sensible of the divine
rebukes they are under. They have beaten me, and I felt it not, says the
drunkard, [Pro 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#035.md). God speaks to
them once, yea, twice; but, like men drunk, they perceive it not, they
understand it not, but forget the law. They stagger in their counsels,
are unstable and unsteady, and stumble at every thing that lies in their
way. There is such a thing as spiritual drunkenness. 2. It is yet more
strange that God himself should have poured out upon them a spirit of
deep sleep, and closed their eyes ([Isa
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#010).md), that he who bids them awake
and open their eyes should yet lay them to sleep and shut their eyes;
but it is in a way of righteous judgment, to punish them for their
loving darkness rather than light, their loving sleep. When God by his
prophets called them they said, Yet a little sleep, a little slumber;
and therefore he gave them up to strong delusions, and said, Sleep on
now. This is applied to the unbelieving Jews, who rejected the gospel of
Christ, and were justly hardened in their infidelity, till wrath came
upon them to the uttermost. [Rom 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#008.md),
God has given them the spirit of slumber. And we have reason to fear it
is the woeful case of many who live in the midst of gospel light. 3. It
is very sad that this should be the case with those who were their
prophets, and rulers, and seers, that those who should have been their
guides were themselves blindfolded; and it is easy to tell what the
fatal consequences will be when the blind lead the blind. This was
fulfilled when, in the latter days of the Jewish church, the chief
priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, were the great
opposers of Christ and his gospel, and brought themselves under a
judicial infatuation. 4. The sad effect of this was that all the means
of conviction, knowledge, and grace, which they enjoyed, were
ineffectual, and did not answer the end ([Isa
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#011.md), [Isa
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#012).md): "The vision of all the
prophets, true and false, has become to you as the words of a book, or
letter, that is sealed up; you cannot discern the truth of the real
visions and the falsehood of the pretended ones." Or, every vision
particularly that this prophet had seen for them, and published to them,
had become unintelligible; they had it among them, but were never the
wiser for it, any more than a man (though a good scholar) is for a book
delivered to him sealed up, and which he must not open the seals of. He
sees it is a book, and that is all; he knows nothing of what is in it.
So they knew that what Isaiah said was a vision and prophecy, but the
meaning of it was hidden from them; it was only a sound of words to
them, which they were not at all alarmed by, nor affected with; it
answered not the intention, for it made no impression at all upon them.
Neither the learned nor the unlearned were the better for all the
messages God sent them by his servants the prophets, nor desired to be
so. The ordinary sort of people excused themselves from regarding what
the prophets said with their want of learning and a liberal education,
as if they were not concerned to know and do the will of God because
they were not bred scholars: It is nothing to me, I am not learned.
Those of better rank pretended that the prophet had a peculiar way of
speaking, which was obscure to them, and which, though they were men of
letters, they had not been used to; and, Si non vis intelligi, debes
negligi - If you wish not to be understood, you deserve to be neglected.
Both these are groundless pretences; for God's prophets have been no
unfaithful debtors either to the wise or to the unwise, [Rom
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#014.md). Or we may take it thus: - The
book of prophecy was given to them sealed, so that they could not read
it, as a just judgment upon them; because it had often been delivered to
them unsealed, and they would not take pains to learn the language of
it, and then made excuse for their not reading it because they were not
learned. But observe, "The vision has become thus to you whose minds the
god of this world has blinded; but it is not so in itself, it is not so
to all; the same vision which to you is a savour of death unto death to
others is and shall be a savour of life unto life." Knowledge is easy to
him that understands.

II\. The prophet, in God's name, threatens those that were formal and
hypocritical in their exercises of devotion, [Isa
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013.md), [Isa
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#014.md). Observe here,

1\. The sin that is here charged upon them - dissembling with God in
their religious performances, [Isa
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013.md). He that knows the heart, and
cannot be imposed upon with shows and pretences, charges it upon them,
whether their hearts condemn them for it or no. He that is greater than
the heart, and knows all things, knows that though they draw nigh to him
with their mouth, and honour him with their lips, yet they are not
sincere worshippers. To worship God is to make our approaches to him,
and to present our adorations of him; it is to draw nigh to him as those
that have business with him, with an intention therein to honour him.
This we are to do with our mouth and our lips, in speaking of him and in
speaking to him; we must render to him the calves of our lips, [Hos
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002.md). And, if the heart be full of his
love and fear, out of the abundance of that the mouth will speak. But
there are many whose religion is lip-labour only. They say that which
expresses an approach to God and an adoration of him, but it is only
from the teeth outward. For, (1.) They do not apply their minds to the
service. When they pretend to be speaking to God they are thinking of a
thousand impertinences: The have removed their hearts far from me, that
they might not be employed in prayer, nor come within reach of the word.
When work was to be done for God, which required the heart, that was
sent out of the way on purpose, with the fool's eyes, into the ends of
the earth. (2.) They do not make the word of God the rule of their
worship, nor his will their reason: Their fear towards me is taught by
the precept of men. They worshipped the God of Israel, not according to
his appointment, but their own inventions, the directions of their false
prophets or their idolatrous kings, or the usages of the nations that
were round about them. The tradition of the elders was of more value and
validity with them than the laws which God commanded Moses. Or, if they
did worship God in a way conformable to his institution in the days of
Hezekiah, a great reformer, they had more an eye to the precept of the
king than to God's command. This our Saviour applies to the Jews in his
time, who were formal in their devotions and wedded to their own
inventions, and pronounces concerning them that in vain they did worship
God, [Mat 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#008.md), [Mat
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#009.md).

2\. It is a spiritual judgment with which God threatens to punish them
for their spiritual wickedness ([Isa
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#014).md): I will proceed to do a
marvellous work. They did one strange thing; they removed all sincerity
from their hearts. Now God will go on and do another; he will remove all
sagacity from their heads. The wisdom of their wise men shall perish.
They played the hypocrite, and thought to put a cheat upon God, and now
they are left to themselves to play the fool, and not only to put a
cheat upon themselves, but to be easily cheated by all about them. Those
that make religion no more than a pretence, to serve a turn, are out in
their politics; and it is just with God to deprive those of their
understanding who part with their uprightness. This was fulfilled in the
wretched infatuation which the Jewish nation were manifestly under,
after they had rejected the gospel of Christ; they removed their hearts
far from God, and therefore God justly removed wisdom far from them, and
hid from their eyes the things that belonged even to their temporal
peace. This is a marvelous work; it is surprising, it is astonishing,
that wise men should of a sudden lose their wisdom and be given up to
strong delusions. Judgments on the mind, though least taken notice of,
are to be most wondered at.

III\. He shows the folly of those that though to act separately and
secretly from God, and were carrying on designs independent upon God and
which they projected to conceal from his all-seeing eye. Here we have,
1. Their politics described ([Isa
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#015).md): They seek deep to hide their
counsel from the Lord, that he may not know either what they do or what
they design; they say, "Who sees us? No man, and therefore not God
himself." The consultations they had about their own safety they kept to
themselves, and never asked God's advice concerning them; nay, they knew
they were displeasing to him, but thought they could conceal them from
him; and, if he did not know them, he could not baffle and defeat them.
See what foolish fruitless pains sinners take in their sinful ways; they
seek deep, they sink deep, to hide their counsel from the Lord, who sits
in heaven and laughs at them. Note, A practical disbelief of God's
omniscience is at the bottom both of the carnal worships and of the
carnal confidences of hypocrites; [Psa
94:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#007.md); [Eze
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#012.md); [Eze
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#009.md). 2. The absurdity of their
politics demonstrated ([Isa 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#016).md):
"Surely your turning of things upside down thus, your various projects,
turning your affairs this and that way to make them shape as you would
have them - or rather your inverting the order of things, and thinking
to make God's providence give attendance to your projects, and that God
must know no more than you think fit, which is perfectly turning things
upside down and beginning at the wrong end - shall be esteemed as the
potter's clay. God will turn and manage you, and all your counsels, with
as much ease and as absolute a power as the potter forms and fashions
his clay." See how God despises, and therefore what little reason we
have to dread, those contrivances of men that are carried on without
God, particularly those against him. (1.) Those that think to hide their
counsels from God do in effect deny him to be their Creator. It is as if
the work should say of him that made it, "He made me not; I made
myself." If God made us, he certainly knows us as the Psalmist shows,
([Psa 139:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#001.md), [Psa
139:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#013).md); so that those who say that
he does not see them might as well say that he did not make them. Much
of the wickedness of the wicked arises from this, they forget that God
formed them, [Deu 32:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#018). Or, (2..md)
Which comes to the same thing, they deny him to be a wise Creator: The
thing framed saith of him that framed it, He had no understanding; for
if he had understanding to make us so curiously, especially to make us
intelligent beings and to put understanding into the inward part ([Job
38:36](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#036).md), no doubt he has understanding
to know us and all we say and do. As those that quarrel with God, so
those that think to conceal themselves from him, do in effect charge him
with folly; but he that formed the eye, shall he not see? [Psa
94:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#009.md).

[Isaiah 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 29:17</span></span>

Those that thought to hide their counsels from the Lord were said to
turn things upside down ([Isa 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#016).md),
and they intended to do it unknown to God; but God here tells them that
he will turn things upside down his way; and let us see whose word shall
stand, his or theirs. They disbelieve Providence: "Wait awhile," says
God, "and you shall be convinced by ocular demonstration that there is a
God who governs the world, and that he governs it and orders all the
changes that are in it for the good of his church." The wonderful
revolution here foretold may refer primarily to the happy settlement of
the affairs of Judah and Jerusalem after the defeat of Sennacherib's
attempt, and the repose which good people then enjoyed, when they were
delivered from the alarms of the sword both of war and persecution. But
it may look further, to the rejection of the Jews at the first planting
of the gospel (for their hypocrisy and infidelity were here foretold,
[Isa 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013).md) and the admission of the
Gentiles into the church.

I. In general, it is a great and surprising change that is here
foretold, [Isa 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017.md). Lebanon, that
was a forest, shall be turned into a fruitful field; and Carmel, that
was a fruitful field, shall become a forest. It is a counterchange.
Note, Great changes, both for the better and for the worse, are often
made in a very little while. It was a sign given them of the defeat of
Sennacherib that the ground should be more than ordinarily fruitful
([Isa 37:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#030).md): You shall eat this year
such as grows of itself; food for man shall be (as food for beasts is)
the spontaneous product of the soil. Then Lebanon became a fruitful
field, so fruitful that that which used to be reckoned a fruitful field
in comparison with it was looked upon but as a forest. When a great
harvest of souls was gathered in to Christ from among the Gentiles then
the wilderness was turned into a fruitful field; and the Jewish church,
that had long been a fruitful field, became a desolate and deserted
forest, [Isa 54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md).

II\. In particular,

1\. Those that were ignorant shall become intelligent, [Isa
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#018.md). Those that understood not this
prophecy (but it was to them as a sealed book, [Isa
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#011).md) shall, when it is accomplished,
understand it, and shall acknowledge, not only the hand of God in the
event, but the voice of God in the prediction of it: The deaf shall then
hear the words of the book. The fulfilling of prophecy is the best
exposition of it. The poor Gentiles shall then have divine revelation
brought among them; and those that sat in darkness shall see a great
light, those that were blind shall see out of obscurity; for the gospel
was sent to them to open their eyes, [Act
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#018.md). Observe, In order to the making
of men fruitful in good affections and actions, the course God's grace
takes with them is to open their understandings and make them hear the
words of God's book.

2\. Those that were erroneous shall become orthodox ([Isa
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#024).md): Those that erred in spirit,
that were under mistakes and misapprehensions concerning the words of
the book and the meaning of them, shall come to understanding, to a
right understanding of things; the Spirit of truth shall rectify their
mistakes and lead them into all truth. This should encourage us to pray
for those that have erred and are deceived, that God can, and often
does, bring such to understanding. Those that murmured at the truths of
God as hard sayings, and loved to pick quarrels with them, shall learn
the true meaning of these doctrines, and then they will be better
reconciled to them. Those that erred concerning the providence of God as
to public affairs, and murmured at the disposals of it, when they shall
see the issue of things shall better understand them and be aware of
what God was designing in all, [Hos
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#009.md).

3\. Those that were melancholy shall become cheerful and pleasant ([Isa
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#019).md): The meek also shall increase
their joy in the Lord. Those who are poor in the world and poor in
spirit, who, being in affliction, accommodate themselves to their
affliction, are purely passive and not passionate, when they see God
appearing for them, they shall add, or repeat, joy in the Lord. This
intimates that even in their distress they kept up their joy in the
Lord, but now they increased it. Note, Those who, when they are in
trouble, can truly rejoice in God, shall soon have cause given them
greatly to rejoice in him. When joy in the world is decreasing and
fading joy in God is increasing and getting round. This shining light
shall shine more and more; for that which is aimed at is that this joy
may be full. Even the poor among men may rejoice in the Holy One of
Israel, and their poverty needs not deprive them of that joy, [Hab
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#017.md), [Hab
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#018.md). And the meek, the humble, the
patient, and dispassionate, shall grow in this joy. Note, The grace of
meekness will contribute very much to the increase of our holy joy.

4\. The enemies, that were formidable, shall become despicable.
Sennacherib, that terrible one, and his great army, that put the country
into such a consternation, shall be brought to nought ([Isa
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#020).md), shall be quite disabled to do
any further mischief. The power of Satan, that terrible one indeed,
shall be broken by the prevalency of Christ's gospel; and those that
were subject to bondage through fear of him that had the power of death
shall be delivered, [Heb 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014.md), [Heb
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#015.md).

5\. The persecutors, that were vexatious, shall be quieted, and so those
they were troublesome to shall be quiet from the fear of them. To
complete the repose of God's people, not only the terrible one from
abroad shall be brought to nought, but the scorners at home too shall be
consumed and cut off by Hezekiah's reformation. Those are a happy
people, and likely to be so, who, when God gives them victory and
success against their terrible enemies abroad, take care to suppress
vice, and profaneness, and the spirit of persecution, those more
dangerous enemies at home. Or, They shall be consumed and cut off by the
judgments of God, shall be singled out to be made examples of. Or, They
shall insensibly waste away, being put to confusion by the fulfilling of
those predictions which they had made a jest of. Observe what had been
the wickedness of these scorners, for which they should be cut off. They
had been persecutors of God's people and prophets, probably of the
prophet Isaiah particularly, and therefore he complains thus feelingly
of them and of their subtle malice. Some as informers and persecutors,
others as judges, did all they could to take away his life, or at least
his liberty. And this is very applicable to the chief priests and
Pharisees, who persecuted Christ and his apostles, and for that sin they
and their nation of scorners were cut off and consumed. (1.) They
ridiculed the prophets and the serious professors of religion; they
despised them, and did their utmost to bring them into contempt; they
were scorners, and sat in the seat of the scornful. (2.) They lay in
wait for an occasion against them. By their spies they watch for
iniquity, to see if they can lay hold of any thing that is said or done
that may be called an iniquity. Or they themselves watch for an
opportunity to do mischief, as Judas did to betray our Lord Jesus. (3.)
They took advantage against them for the least slip of the tongue; and,
if a thing were ever so little said amiss, it served them to ground an
indictment upon. They made a man, though he were ever so wise and good a
man, though he were a man of God, an offender for a word, a word
mischosen or misplaced, when they could not but know that it was well
meant, [Isa 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#021.md). They cavilled at
every word that the prophets spoke to them by way of admonition, though
ever so innocently spoken, and without any design to affront them. They
put the worst construction upon what was said, and made it criminal by
strained innuendoes. Those who consider how apt we all are to speak
unadvisedly, and to mistake what we hear, will think it very unjust and
unfair to make a man an offender for a word. (4.) They did all they
could to bring those into trouble that dealt faithfully with them and
told them of their faults. Those that reprove in the gates, reprovers by
office, that were bound by the duty of their place, as prophets, as
judges, and magistrates, to show people their transgressions, they hated
these, and laid snares for them, as the Pharisees' emissaries, who were
sent to watch our Saviour that they might entangle him in his talk ([Mat
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#015).md), that they might have something
to lay to his charge which might render him odious to the people or
obnoxious to the government. So persecuted they the prophets; and it is
next to impossible for the most cautious to place their words so warily
as to escape such snares. See how base wicked people are, who bear
ill-will to those who, out of good-will to them, seek to save their
souls from death; and see what need reprovers have both of courage to do
their duty and of prudence to avoid the snare. (5.) They pervert
judgment, and will never let an honest man carry an honest cause: They
turn aside the just for a thing of nought; they condemn him, or give the
cause against him, upon no evidence, no colour or pretence whatsoever.
They run a man down, and misrepresent him, by all the little arts and
tricks they can devise, as they did our Saviour. We must not think it
strange if we see the best of men thus treated; the disciple is not
greater than his Master. But wait awhile, and God will not only bring
forth their righteousness, but cut off and consume these scorners.

6\. Jacob, who was made to blush by the reproaches, and made to tremble
by the threatenings, of his enemies, shall now be relieved both against
his shame and against his fear, by the rolling away of those reproaches
and the defeating of those threatenings ([Isa
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#022).md): Thus the Lord saith who
redeemed Abraham, that is, called him out of Ur of the Chaldees, and so
rescued him from the idolatry of his fathers and plucked him as a brand
out of the fire. He that redeemed Abraham out of his snares and troubles
will redeem all that are by faith his genuine seed out of theirs. He
that began his care of his church in the redemption of Abraham, when it
and its Redeemer were in his loins, will not now cast off the care of
it. Because the enemies of his people are so industrious both to blacken
them and to frighten them, therefore he will appear for the house of
Jacob, and they shall not be ashamed as they have been, but shall have
wherewith to answer those that reproach them, nor shall their faces now
wax pale; but they shall gather courage, and look their enemies in the
face without change of countenance, as those have reason to do who have
the God of Abraham on their side.

7\. Jacob, who thought his family would be extinct and the entail of
religion quite cut off, shall have the satisfaction of seeing a numerous
progeny devoted to God for a generation, [Isa
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#023). (1..md) He shall see his children,
multitudes of believers and praying people, the spiritual seed of
faithful Abraham and wrestling Jacob. Having his quiver full of these
arrows, he shall not be ashamed ([Isa
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#022).md) but shall speak with his enemy
in the gate, [Psa 127:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#005.md). Christ shall
not be ashamed ([Isa 50:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007).md), for he
shall see his seed ([Isa 53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010).md); he
sees some, and foresees more, in the midst of him, flocking to the
church, and residing there. (2.) His children are the work of God's
hands; being formed by him, they are formed for him, his workmanship,
created unto good works. It is some comfort to parents to think that
their children are God's creatures, the work of the hands of his grace.
(3.) He and his children shall sanctify the name of God as their God, as
the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear and worship the God of Israel.
This is opposed to his being ashamed and waxing pale; when he is
delivered from his contempts and dangers he shall not magnify himself,
but sanctify the Holy One of Jacob. If God make our condition easy, we
must endeavour to make his name glorious. Parents and children are
ornaments and comforts indeed to each other when they join in
sanctifying the name of God. When parents give up their children, and
children give up themselves, to God, to be to him for a name and a
praise, then the forest will soon become a fruitful field.
