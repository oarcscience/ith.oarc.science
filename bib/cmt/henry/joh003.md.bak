### [John Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#001.md)

[John](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">joh 3:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have, I. Christ's discourse with Nicodemus, a
Pharisee, concerning the great mysteries of the gospel, in which he here
privately instructs him (v. 1-21). II. John Baptist's discourse with his
disciples concerning Christ, upon occasion of his coming into the
neighbourhood where John was ([Joh
3:22-36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#022).md), in which he fairly and
faithfully resigns all his honour and interest to him.

[John 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 3:1</span></span>

We found, in the close of the foregoing chapter, that few were brought
to Christ at Jerusalem; yet here was one, a considerable one. It is
worth while to go a great way for the salvation though but of one soul.
Observe,

I. Who this Nicodemus was. Not many mighty and noble are called; yet
some are, and here was one. Not many of the rulers, or of the Pharisees;
yet. 1. This was a man of the Pharisees, bred to learning, a scholar.
Let it not be said that all Christ's followers are unlearned and
ignorant men. The principles of the Pharisees, and the peculiarities of
their sect, were directly contrary to the spirit of Christianity; yet
there were some in whom even those high thoughts were cast down and
brought into obedience to Christ. The grace of Christ is able to subdue
the greatest opposition. 2. He was a ruler of the Jews, a member of the
great sanhedrim, a senator, a privy-counsellor, a man of authority in
Jerusalem. Bad as things were, there were some rulers well inclined, who
yet could do little good because the stream was so strong against them;
they were over-ruled by the majority, and yoked with those that were
corrupt, so that the good which they wished to do they could not do; yet
Nicodemus continued in his place, and did what he could, when he could
not do what he would.

II\. His solemn address to our Lord Jesus Christ, [Joh
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#002.md). See here,

1\. When he came: He came to Jesus by night. Observe, (1.) He made a
private and particular address to Christ, and did not think it enough to
hear his public discourses. He resolved to talk with him by himself,
where he might be free with him. Personal converse with skilful faithful
ministers about the affairs of our souls would be of great use to us,
[Mal 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007). (2..md) He made this address by
night, which may be considered, \[1.\] As an act of prudence and
discretion. Christ was engaged all day in public work, and he would not
interrupt him then, nor expect his attendance then, but observed
Christ's hour, and waited on him when he was at leisure. Note, Private
advantages to ourselves and our own families must give way to those that
are public. The greater good must be preferred before the less. Christ
had many enemies, and therefore Nicodemus came to him incognito, lest
being known to the chief priests they should be the more enraged against
Christ. \[2.\] As an act of zeal and forwardness. Nicodemus was a man of
business, and could not spare time all day to make Christ a visit, and
therefore he would rather take time from the diversions of the evening,
or the rest of the night, than not converse with Christ. When others
were sleeping, he was getting knowledge, as David by meditation, [Psa
63:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#006.md), and [Psa
119:148](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#148.md). Probably it was the very next
night after he saw Christ's miracles, and he would not neglect the first
opportunity of pursuing his convictions. He knew not how soon Christ
might leave the town, nor what might happen betwixt that and another
feast, and therefore would lose no time. In the night his converse with
Christ would be more free, and less liable to disturbance. These were
Noctes Christianae - Christian nights, much more instructive than the
Noctes Atticae - Attic nights. Or, \[3.\] As an act of fear and
cowardice. He was afraid, or ashamed, to be seen with Christ, and
therefore came in the night. When religion is out of fashion, there are
many Nicodemites, especially among the rulers, who have a better
affection to Christ and his religion than they would be known to have.
But observe, First, Though he came by night, Christ bade him welcome,
accepted his integrity, and pardoned his infirmity; he considered his
temper, which perhaps was timorous, and the temptation he was in from
his place and office; and hereby taught his ministers to become all
things to all men, and to encourage good beginnings, though weak. Paul
preached privately to those of reputation, [Gal
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#002.md). Secondly, Though now he came by
night, yet afterwards, when there was occasion, he owned Christ
publicly, [Joh 7:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#050.md); [Joh
19:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#039.md). The grace which is at first but
a grain of mustard-seed may grow to be a great tree.

2\. What he said. He did not come to talk with Christ about politics and
state-affairs (though he was a ruler), but about the concerns of his own
soul and its salvation, and, without circumlocution, comes immediately
to the business; he calls Christ Rabbi, which signifies a great man; see
[Isa 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#020.md). He shall send them a
Saviour, and a great one; a Saviour and a rabbi, so the word is. There
are hopes of those who have a respect for Christ, and think and speak
honourably of him. He tells Christ how far he had attained: We know that
thou art a teacher. Observe, (1.) His assertion concerning Christ: Thou
art a teacher come from God; not educated nor ordained by men, as other
teachers, but supported with divine inspiration and divine authority. He
that was to be the sovereign Ruler came first to be a teacher; for he
would rule with reason, not with rigour, by the power of truth, not of
the sword. The world lay in ignorance and mistake; the Jewish teachers
were corrupt, and caused them to err: It is time for the Lord to work.
He came a teacher from God, from God as the Father of mercies, in pity
to a dark deceived world; from God as the Father of lights and fountain
of truth, all the light and truth upon which we may venture our souls.
(2.) His assurance of it: We know, not only I, but others; so he took it
for granted, the thing being so plain and self-evident. Perhaps he knew
that there were divers of the Pharisees and rulers with whom he
conversed that were under the same convictions, but had not the grace to
own it. Or, we may suppose that he speaks in the plural number (We know)
because he brought with him one or more of his friends and pupils, to
receive instructions from Christ, knowing them to be of common concern.
"Master," saith he, "we come with a desire to be taught, to be thy
scholars, for we are fully satisfied thou art a divine teacher." (3.)
The ground of this assurance: No man can do those miracles that thou
doest, except God be with him. Here, \[1.\] We are assured of the truth
of Christ's miracles, and that they were not counterfeit. Here was
Nicodemus, a judicious, sensible, inquisitive man, one that had all the
reason and opportunity imaginable to examine them, so fully satisfied
that they were real miracles that he was wrought upon by them to go
contrary to his interest, and to the stream of those of his own rank,
who were prejudiced against Christ. \[2.\] We are directed what
inference to draw from Christ's miracles: Therefore we are to receive
him as a teacher come from God. His miracles were his credentials. The
course of nature could not be altered but by the power of the God of
nature, who, we are sure, is the God of truth and goodness, and would
never set his seal to a lie or a cheat.

III\. The discourse between Christ and Nicodemus hereupon, or, rather,
the sermon Christ preached to him; the contents of it, and that perhaps
an abstract of Christ's public preaching; see [Joh
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#011.md), [Joh
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#012.md). Four things our Saviour here
discourses of: -

1\. Concerning the necessity and nature of regeneration or the new
birth, [Joh 3:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003.md). Now we must
consider this,

(1.) As pertinently answered to Nicodemus's address. Jesus answered,
[Joh 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003.md). This answer was wither,
\[1.\] A rebuke of what he saw defective in the address of Nicodemus. It
was not enough for him to admire Christ's miracles, and acknowledge his
mission, but he must be born again. It is plain that he expected the
kingdom of heaven, the kingdom of the Messiah now shortly to appear. He
is betimes aware of the dawning of that day; and, according to the
common notion of the Jews, he expects it to appear in external pomp and
power. He doubts not but this Jesus, who works these miracles, is either
the Messiah or his prophet, and therefore makes his court to him,
compliments him, and so hopes to secure a share to himself of the
advantages of that kingdom. But Christ tells him that he can have no
benefit by that change of the state, unless there be a change of the
spirit, of the principles and dispositions, equivalent to a new birth.
Nicodemus came by night: "But this will not do," saith Christ. His
religion must be owned before men; so Dr. Hammond. Or, \[2.\] A reply to
what he saw designed in his address. When Nicodemus owned Christ a
teacher come from God, one entrusted with an extraordinary revelation
from heaven, he plainly intimated a desire to know what this revelation
was and a readiness to receive it; and Christ declares it.

(2.) As positively and vehemently asserted by our Lord Jesus: Verily,
verily, I say unto thee. I the Amen, the Amen, say it; so it may be
read: "I the faithful and true witness." The matter is settled
irreversibly that except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom
of God. "I say it to thee, though a Pharisee, though a master in
Israel." Observe,

\[1.\] What it is that is required: to be born again; that is, First, We
must live a new life. Birth is the beginning of life; to be born again
is to begin anew, as those that have hitherto lived either much amiss or
to little purpose. We must not think to patch up the old building, but
begin from the foundation. Secondly, We must have a new nature, new
principles, new affections, new aims. We must be born anōthen, which
signifies both denuo - again, and desuper - from above. 1. We must be
born anew; so the word is taken, [Gal
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009.md), and ab initio - from the
beginning, [Luk 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#003.md). By our first
birth we are corrupt, shapen in sin and iniquity; we must therefore
undergo a second birth; our souls must be fashioned and enlivened anew.
2. We must be born from above, so the word is used by the evangelist,
[Joh 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#031.md); [Joh
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#011.md), and I take this to be
especially intended here, not excluding the other; for to be born from
above supposes being born again. But this new birth has its rise from
heaven ([Joh 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#013).md) and its tendency to
heaven: it is to be born to a divine and heavenly life, a life of
communion with God and the upper world, and, in order to this, it is to
partake of a divine nature and bear the image of the heavenly.

\[2.\] The indispensable necessity of this: "Except a man (Any one that
partakes of the human nature, and consequently of its corruptions) be
born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God, the kingdom of the Messiah
begun in grace and perfected in glory." Except we be born from above, we
cannot see this. That is, First, We cannot understand the nature of it.
Such is the nature of things pertaining to the kingdom of God (in which
Nicodemus desired to be instructed) that the soul must be re-modelled
and moulded, the natural man must become a spiritual man, before he is
capable of receiving and understanding them, [Co1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014.md). Secondly, We cannot receive the
comfort of it, cannot expect any benefit by Christ and his gospel, nor
have any part or lot in the matter. Note, Regeneration is absolutely
necessary to our happiness here and hereafter. Considering what we are
by nature, how corrupt and sinful, - what God is, in whom alone we can
be happy, - and what heaven is, to which the perfection of our happiness
is reserved, - it will appear, in the nature of the thing, that we must
be born again, because it is impossible that we should be happy if we be
not holy; see [Co1 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011.md), [Co1
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#012.md).

This great truth of the necessity of regeneration being thus solemnly
laid down,

a\. It is objected against by Nicodemus ([Joh
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#004).md): How can a man be born when he is
old, old as I am: gerōn ōn - being an old man? Can he enter the second
time into his mother's womb, and be born? Herein appears, (a.) His
weakness in knowledge; what Christ spoke spiritually he seems to have
understood after a corporal and carnal manner, as if there were no other
way of regenerating and new-moulding an immortal soul than by
new-framing the body, and bringing that back to the rock out of which it
was hewn, as if there was such a connection between the soul and the
body that there could be no fashioning the heart anew but by forming the
bones anew. Nicodemus, as others of the Jews, valued himself, no doubt,
very much on his first birth and its dignities and privileges, - the
place of it, the Holy Land, perhaps the holy city, - his parentage, such
as that which Paul could have gloried in, [Phi
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005.md). And therefore it is a great
surprise to him to hear of being born again. Could he be better bred and
born than bred and born an Israelite, or by any other birth stand fairer
for a place in the kingdom of the Messiah? Indeed they looked upon a
proselyted Gentile to be as one born again or born anew, but could not
imagine how a Jew, a Pharisee, could ever better himself by being born
again; he therefore thinks, if he must be born again, it must be of her
that bore him first. They that are proud of their first birth are hardly
brought to a new birth. (b.) His willingness to be taught. He does not
turn his back upon Christ because of his hard saying, but ingenuously
acknowledges his ignorance, which implies a desire to be better
informed; and so I take this, rather than that he had such gross notions
of the new birth Christ spoke of: "Lord, make me to understand this, for
it is a riddle to me; I am such a fool as to know no other way for a man
to be born than of his mother." When we meet with that in the things of
God which is dark, and hard to be understood, we must with humility and
industry continue our attendance upon the means of knowledge, till God
shall reveal even that unto us.

b\. It is opened and further explained by our Lord Jesus, [Joh
3:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005.md). From the objection he takes
occasion,

(a.) To repeat and confirm what he had said ([Joh
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005).md): "Verily, verily, I say unto
thee, the very same that I said before." Note, The word of God is not
yea and nay, but yea and amen; what he hath said he will abide by,
whoever saith against it; nor will he retract any of his sayings for the
ignorance and mistakes of men. Though Nicodemus understood not the
mystery of regeneration, yet Christ asserts the necessity of it as
positively as before. Note, It is folly to think of evading the
obligation of evangelical precepts, by pleading that they are
unintelligible, [Rom 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003.md), [Rom
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004.md).

(b.) To expound and clear what he had said concerning regeneration; for
the explication of which he further shows,

\[a.\] The author of this blessed change, and who it is that works it.
To be born again is to be born of the Spirit, [Joh
3:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005.md). The change is not wrought by
any wisdom or power of our own, but by the power and influence of the
blessed Spirit of grace. It is the sanctification of the Spirit ([Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002).md) and renewing of the Holy Ghost,
[Tit 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005.md). The word he works by is his
inspiration, and the heart to be wrought on he has access to.

\[b.\] The nature of this change, and what that is which is wrought; it
is spirit, [Joh 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006.md). Those that are
regenerated are made spiritual, and refined from the dross and dregs of
sensuality. The dictates and interests of the rational and immortal soul
have retrieved the dominion they ought to have over the flesh. The
Pharisees placed their religion in external purity and external
performances; and it would be a mighty change indeed with them, no less
than a new birth, to become spiritual.

\[c.\] The necessity of this change. First, Christ here shows that it is
necessary in the nature of the thing, for we are not fit to enter into
the kingdom of God till we are born again: That which is born of the
flesh if flesh, [Joh 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006.md). Here is our
malady, with the causes of it, which are such that it is plain there is
no remedy but we must be born again. 1. We are here told what we are: We
are flesh, not only corporeal but corrupt, [Gen
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003.md). The soul is still a spiritual
substance, but so wedded to the flesh, so captivated by the will of the
flesh, so in love with the delights of the flesh, so employed in making
provision for the flesh, that it is mostly called flesh; it is carnal.
And what communion can there be between God, who is a spirit, and a soul
in this condition? 2. How we came to be so; by being born of the flesh.
It is a corruption that is bred in the bone with us, and therefore we
cannot have a new nature, but we must be born again. The corrupt nature,
which is flesh, takes rise from our first birth; and therefore the new
nature, which is spirit, must take rise from a second birth. Nicodemus
spoke of entering again into his mother's womb, and being born; but, if
he could do so, to what purpose? If he were born of his mother a hundred
times, that would not mend the matter, for still that which is born of
the flesh if flesh; a clean thing cannot be brought out of an unclean.
He must seek for another original, must be born of the Spirit, or he
cannot become spiritual. The case is, in short, this: though man is made
to consist of body and soul, yet his spiritual part had then so much the
dominion over his corporeal part that he was denominated a living soul
([Gen 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007).md), but by indulging the
appetite of the flesh, in eating forbidden fruit, he prostituted the
just dominion of the soul to the tyranny of sensual lust, and became no
longer a living soul, but flesh: Dust thou art. The living soul became
dead and inactive; thus in the day he sinned he surely died, and so he
became earthly. In this degenerate state, he begat a son in his own
likeness; he transmitted the human nature, which had been entirely
deposited in his hands, thus corrupted and depraved; and in the same
plight it is still propagated. Corruption and sin are woven into our
nature; we are shapen in iniquity, which makes it necessary that the
nature be changed. It is not enough to put on a new coat or a new face,
but we must put on the new man, we must be new creatures. Secondly,
Christ makes it further necessary, by his own word: Marvel not that I
said unto thee, You must be born again, [Joh
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#007.md). 1. Christ hath said it, and as he
himself never did, nor ever will, unsay it, so all the world cannot
gainsay it, that we must be born again. He who is the great Lawgiver,
whose will is a law, - he who is the great Mediator of the new covenant,
and has full power to settle the terms of our reconciliation to God and
happiness in him, - he who is the great Physician of souls, knows their
case, and what is necessary to their cure, - he hath said, You must be
born again. "I said unto thee that which all are concerned in, You must,
you all, one as well as another, you must be born again: not only the
common people, but the rulers, the masters in Israel." 2. We are not to
marvel at it; for when we consider the holiness of the God with whom we
have to do, the great design of our redemption, the depravity of our
nature, and the constitution of the happiness set before us, we shall
not think it strange that so much stress is laid upon this as the one
thing needful, that we must be born again.

\[d.\] This change is illustrated by two comparisons. First, The
regenerating work of the Spirit is compared to water, [Joh
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005.md). To be born again is to be born of
water and of the Spirit, that is, of the Spirit working like water, as
([Mat 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011).md) with the Holy Ghost and
with fire means with the Holy Ghost as with fire. 1. That which is
primarily intended here is to show that the Spirit, in sanctifying a
soul, (1.) Cleanses and purifies it as water, takes away its filth, by
which it was unfit for the kingdom of God. It is the washing of
regeneration, [Tit 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005.md). You are
washed, [Co1 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011.md). See [Eze
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025). (2..md) Cools and refreshes it, as
water does the hunted hart and the weary traveller. The Spirit is
compared to water, [Joh 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038.md), [Joh
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039.md); [Isa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003.md). In the first creation, the
fruits of heaven were born of water ([Gen
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#020).md), in allusion to which, perhaps,
they that are born from above are said to be born of water. 2. It is
probable that Christ had an eye to the ordinance of baptism, which John
had used and he himself had begun to use, "You must be born again of the
Spirit," which regeneration by the Spirit should be signified by washing
with water, as the visible sign of that spiritual grace: not that all
they, and they only, that are baptized, are saved; but without that new
birth which is wrought by the Spirit, and signified by baptism, none
shall be looked upon as the protected privileged subjects of the kingdom
of heaven. The Jews cannot partake of the benefits of the Messiah's
kingdom, they have so long looked for, unless they quit all expectations
of being justified by the works of the law, and submit to the baptism of
repentance, the great gospel duty, for the remission of sins, the great
gospel privilege. Secondly, It is compared to wind: The wind bloweth
where it listeth, so is every one that is born of the Spirit, [Joh
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008). The same word (pneuma.md) signifies
both the wind and the Spirit. The Spirit came upon the apostles in a
rushing mighty wind ([Act 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#002).md), his
strong influences on the hearts of sinners are compared to the breathing
of the wind ([Eze 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#009).md), and his sweet
influences on the souls of saints to the north and south wind, [Sol
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#016.md). This comparison is here used to
show, 1. That the Spirit, in regeneration, works arbitrarily, and as a
free agent. The wind bloweth where it listeth for us, and does not
attend our order, nor is subject to our command. God directs it; it
fulfils his word, [Psa 148:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#008.md). The
Spirit dispenses his influences where, and when, on whom, and in what
measure and degree, he pleases, dividing to every man severally as he
will, [Co1 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#011.md). 2. That he works
powerfully, and with evident effects: Thou hearest the sound thereof;
though its causes are hidden, its effects are manifest. When the soul is
brought to mourn for sin, to groan under the burden of corruption, to
breathe after Christ, to cry Abba - Father, then we hear the sound of
the Spirit, we find he is at work, as [Act
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#011.md), Behold he prayeth. 3. That he
works mysteriously, and in secret hidden ways: Thou canst not tell
whence it comes, nor whither it goes. How it gathers and how it spends
its strength is a riddle to us; so the manner and methods of the
Spirit's working are a mystery. Which way went the Spirit? [Kg1
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#024.md). See [Ecc
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#005.md), and compare it with [Psa
139:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#014.md).

2\. Here is a discourse concerning the certainty and sublimity of gospel
truths, which Christ takes occasion for from the weakness of Nicodemus.
Here is,

(1.) The objection which Nicodemus still made ([Joh
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#009).md): How can these things be?
Christ's explication of the doctrine of the necessity of regeneration,
it should seem, made it never the clearer to him. The corruption of
nature which makes it necessary, and the way of the Spirit which makes
it practicable, are as much mysteries to him as the thing itself; though
he had in general owned Christ a divine teacher, yet he was unwilling to
receive his teachings when they did not agree with the notions he had
imbibed. Thus many profess to admit the doctrine of Christ in general,
and yet will neither believe the truths of Christianity nor submit to
the laws of it further than they please. Christ shall be their teacher,
provided they may choose their lesson. Now here, \[1.\] Nicodemus owns
himself ignorant of Christ's meaning, after all: "How can these things
be? They are things I do not understand, my capacity will not reach
them." Thus the things of the Spirit of God are foolishness to the
natural man. He is not only estranged from them, and therefore they are
dark to him, but prejudiced against them, and therefore they are
foolishness to him. \[2.\] Because this doctrine was unintelligible to
him (so he was pleased to make it), he questions the truth of it; as if,
because it was a paradox to him, it was a chimera in itself. Many have
such an opinion of their own capacity as to think that that cannot be
proved which they cannot believe; by wisdom they knew not Christ.

(2.) The reproof which Christ gave him for his dulness and ignorance:
"Art thou a master in Israel, Didaskalos - a teacher, a tutor, one who
sits in Moses's chair, and yet not only unacquainted with the doctrine
of regeneration, but incapable of understanding it?" This word is a
reproof, \[1.\] To those who undertake to teach others and yet are
ignorant and unskilful in the word of righteousness themselves. \[2.\]
To those that spend their time in learning and teaching notions and
ceremonies in religion, niceties and criticisms in the scripture, and
neglect that which is practical and tends to reform the heart and life.
Two words in the reproof are very emphatic: - First, The place where his
lot was cast: in Israel, where there was such great plenty of the means
of knowledge, where divine revelation was. He might have learned this
out of the Old Testament. Secondly, The things he was thus ignorant in:
these things, these necessary things, there great things, these divine
things; had he never read [Psa 50:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#005.md),
[Psa 50:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#010.md); [Eze
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#031.md); [Eze
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025.md), [Eze
36:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#026.md)?

(3.) Christ's discourse, hereupon, of the certainty and sublimity of
gospel truths ([Joh 3:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#011).md), to show
the folly of those who make strange of these things, and to recommend
them to our search. Observe here,

\[1.\] That the truths Christ taught were very certain and what we may
venture upon ([Joh 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#011).md): We speak
that we do know. We; whom does he mean besides himself? Some understand
it of those that bore witness to him and with him on earth, the prophets
and John Baptist; they spoke what they knew, and had seen, and were
themselves abundantly satisfied in: divine revelation carries its own
proof along with it. Others of those that bore witness from heaven, the
Father and the Holy Ghost; the Father was with him, the Spirit of the
Lord was upon him; therefore he speaks in the plural number, as [Joh
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023.md) : We will come unto him.
Observe, First, That the truths of Christ are of undoubted certainty. We
have all the reason in the world to be assured that the sayings of
Christ are faithful sayings, and such as we may venture our souls upon;
for he is not only a credible witness, who would not go about to deceive
us, but a competent witness, who could not himself be deceived: We
testify that we have seen. He spoke not upon hear-say, but upon the
clearest evidence, and therefore with the greatest assurance. What he
spoke of God, of the invisible world, of heaven and hell, of the divine
will concerning us, and the counsels of peace, was what he knew, and had
seen, for he was by him as one brought up with him, [Pro
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#030.md). Whatever Christ spoke, he spoke
of his own knowledge. Secondly, That the unbelief of sinners is greatly
aggravated by the infallible certainty of the truths of Christ. The
things are thus sure, thus clear; and yet you receive not our witness.
Multitudes to be unbelievers of that which yet (so cogent are the
motives of credibility) they cannot disbelieve!

\[2.\] The truths Christ taught, though communicated in language and
expressions borrowed from common and earthly things, yet in their own
nature were most sublime and heavenly; this is intimated, [Joh
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#012.md) : "If I have told them earthly
things, that is, have told them the great things of God in similitudes
taken from earthly things, to make them the more easy and intelligible,
as that of the new birth and the wind, - if I have thus accommodated
myself to your capacities, and lisped to you in your own language, and
cannot make you to understand my doctrine, - what would you do if I
should accommodate myself to the nature of the things, and speak with
the tongue of angels, that language which mortals cannot utter? If such
familiar expressions be stumbling-blocks, what would abstract ideas be,
and spiritual things painted proper?" Now we may learn hence, First, To
admire the height and depth of the doctrine of Christ; it is a great
mystery of godliness. The things of the gospel are heavenly things, out
of the road of the enquiries of human reason, and much more out of the
reach of its discoveries. Secondly, To acknowledge with thankfulness the
condescension of Christ, that he is pleased to suit the manner of the
gospel revelation to our capacities, to speak to us as to children. He
considers our frame, that we are of the earth, and our place, that we
are on the earth, and therefore speaks to us earthly things, and makes
things sensible the vehicle of things spiritual, to make them the more
easy and familiar to us. Thus he has done both in parables and in
sacraments. Thirdly, To lament the corruption of our nature, and our
great unaptness to receive and entertain the truths of Christ. Earthly
things are despised because they are vulgar, and heavenly things because
they are abstruse; and so, whatever method is taken, still some fault or
other is found with it ([Mat 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#017).md),
but Wisdom is, and will be, justified of her children, notwithstanding.

\[3.\] Our Lord Jesus, and he alone, was fit to reveal to us a doctrine
thus certain, thus sublime: No man hath ascended up into heaven but he,
[Joh 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#013.md).

First, None but Christ was able to reveal to us the will of God for our
salvation. Nicodemus addressed Christ as a prophet; but he must know
that he is greater than all the Old Testament prophets, for none of them
had ascended into heaven. They wrote by divine inspiration, and not of
their own knowledge; see [Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md).
Moses ascended into the mount, but not into heaven. No man hath attained
to the certain knowledge of God and heavenly things as Christ has; see
[Mat 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027.md). It is not for us to send
to heaven for instructions; we must wait to receive what instructions
Heaven will send to us; see [Pro 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#004.md);
[Deu 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#012.md).

Secondly, Jesus Christ is able, and fit, and every way qualified, to
reveal the will of God to us; for it is he that came down from heaven
and is in heaven. He had said ([Joh
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#012).md), How shall ye believe, if I tell
you of heavenly things? Now here, 1. He gives them an instance of those
heavenly things which he could tell them of, when he tells them of one
that came down from heaven, and yet is the Son of man; is the Son of
man, and yet is in heaven. If the regeneration of the soul of man is
such a mystery, what then is the incarnation of the Son of God? These
are divine and heavenly things indeed. We have here an intimation of
Christ's two distinct natures in one person: his divine nature, in which
he came down from heaven; his human nature, in which he is the Son of
man; and that union of those two, in that while he is the Son of man yet
he is in heaven. 2. He gives them a proof of his ability to speak to
them heavenly things, and to lead them into the arcana of the kingdom of
heaven, by telling them, (1.) That he came down from heaven. The
intercourse settled between God and man began above; the first motion
towards it did not arise from this earth, but came down from heaven. We
love him, and send to him, because he first loved us, and sent to us.
Now this intimates, \[1.\] Christ's divine nature. He that came down
from heaven is certainly more than a mere man; he is the Lord from
heaven, [Co1 15:47](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#047.md). \[2.\] His
intimate acquaintance with the divine counsels; for, coming from the
court of heaven, he had been from eternity conversant with them. \[3.\]
The manifestation of God. Under the Old Testament God's favours to his
people are expressed by his hearing from heaven ([Ch2
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#014).md), looking from heaven ([Psa
80:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#014).md), speaking from heaven ([Neh
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#013).md), sending from heaven, [Psa
57:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003.md). But the New Testament shows us
God coming down from heaven, to teach and save us. That he thus
descended is an admirable mystery, for the Godhead cannot change places,
nor did he bring his body from heaven; but that he thus condescended for
our redemption is a more admirable mercy; herein he commended his love.
(2.) That he is the Son of man, that Son of man spoken of by Daniel
([Dan 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013).md), by which the Jews always
understand to be meant the Messiah. Christ, in calling himself the Son
of man, shows that he is the second Adam, for the first Adam was the
father of man. And of all the Old Testament titles of the Messiah he
chose to make use of this, because it was most expressive of his
humility, and most agreeable to his present state of humiliation. (3.)
That he is in heaven. Now at this time, when he is talking with
Nicodemus on earth, yet, as God, he is in heaven. The Son of man, as
such, was not in heaven till his ascension; but he that was the Son of
man was now, by his divine nature, every where present, and particularly
in heaven. Thus the Lord of glory, as such, could not be crucified, nor
could God, as such, shed his blood; yet that person who was the Lord of
glory was crucified ([Co1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008).md), and
God purchased the church with his own blood, [Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md). So close is the union of the
two natures in one person that there is a communication of properties.
He doth not say hos esti. God is the ho ōn tō ouranō - he that is, and
heaven is the habitation of his holiness.

3\. Christ here discourses of the great design of his own coming into
the world, and the happiness of those that believe in him, [Joh
3:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014.md). Here we have the very marrow
and quintessence of the whole gospel, that faithful saying ([Ti1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015).md), that Jesus Christ came to seek
and to save the children of men from death, and recover them to life.
Now sinners are dead men upon a twofold account: - (1.) As one that is
mortally wounded, or sick of an incurable disease, is said to be a dead
man, for he is dying; and so Christ came to save us, by healing us, as
the brazen serpent healed the Israelites, [Joh
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014.md), [Joh
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#015). (2..md) As one that is justly
condemned to die for an unpardonable crime is a dead man, he is dead in
law; and, in reference to this part of our danger, Christ came to save
as a prince or judge, publishing an act of indemnity, or general pardon,
under certain provisos; this saving here is opposed to condemning, [Joh
3:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016.md).

\[1.\] Jesus Christ came to save us by healing us, as the children of
Israel that were stung with fiery serpents were cured and lived by
looking up to the brazen serpent; we have the story of it, [Num
21:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#006.md). It was the last miracle that
passed through the hand of Moses before his death. Now in this type of
Christ we may observe,

First, The deadly and destructive nature of sin, which is implied here.
The guilt of sin is like the pain of the biting of a fiery serpent; the
power of corruption is like the venom diffused thereby. The devil is the
old serpent, subtle at first ([Gen
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#001).md), but ever since fiery, and his
temptations fiery darts, his assaults terrifying, his victories
destroying. Ask awakened consciences, ask damned sinners, and they will
tell you, how charming soever the allurements of sin are, at the last it
bites like a serpent, [Pro 23:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#030.md).
God's wrath against us for sin is as those fiery serpents which God sent
among the people, to punish them for their murmurings. The curses of the
law are as fiery serpents, so are all the tokens of divine wrath.

Secondly, The powerful remedy provided against this fatal malady. The
case of poor sinners is deplorable; but is it desperate? Thanks be to
God, it is not; there is balm in Gilead. The Son of man is lifted up, as
the serpent of brass was by Moses, which cured the stung Israelites. 1.
It was a serpent of brass that cured them. Brass is bright; we read of
Christ's feet shining like brass, [Rev
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#015.md). It is durable; Christ is the
same. It was made in the shape of a fiery serpent, and yet had no
poison, no sting, fitly representing Christ, who was made sin for us and
yet knew no sin; was made in the likeness of sinful flesh and yet not
sinful; as harmless as a serpent of brass. The serpent was a cursed
creature; Christ was made a curse. That which cured them reminded them
of their plague; so in Christ sin is set before us most fiery and
formidable. 2. It was lifted up upon a pole, and so must the Son of man
be lifted up; thus it behoved him, [Luk
24:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026.md), [Luk
24:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#046.md). No remedy now. Christ is lifted
up, (1.) In his crucifixion. He was lifted up upon the cross. His death
is called his being lifted up, [Joh
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032.md), [Joh
12:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#033.md). He was lifted up as a
spectacle, as a mark, lifted up between heaven and earth, as if he had
been unworthy of either and abandoned by both. (2.) In his exaltation.
He was lifted up to the Father's right hand, to give repentance and
remission; he was lifted up to the cross, to be further lifted up to the
crown. (3.) In the publishing and preaching of his everlasting gospel,
[Rev 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006.md). The serpent was lifted up
that all the thousands of Israel might see it. Christ in the gospel is
exhibited to us, evidently set forth; Christ is lifted up as an ensign,
[Isa 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010.md). 3. It was lifted up by
Moses. Christ was made under the law of Moses, and Moses testified of
him. 4. Being thus lifted up, it was appointed for the cure of those
that were bitten by fiery serpents. He that sent the plague provided the
remedy. None could redeem and save us but he whose justice had condemned
us. It was God himself that found the ransom, and the efficacy of it
depends upon his appointment. The fiery serpents were sent to punish
them for their tempting Christ (so the apostle saith, [Co1
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#009).md), and yet they were healed by
virtue derived from him. He whom we have offended is our peace.

Thirdly, The way of applying this remedy, and that is by believing,
which plainly alludes to the Israelites' looking up to the brazen
serpent, in order to their being healed by it. If any stung Israelite
was either so little sensible of his pain and peril, or had so little
confidence in the word of Moses as not to look up to the brazen serpent,
justly did he die of his wound; but every one that looked up to it did
well, [Num 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#009.md). If any so far slight
either their disease by sin or the method of cure by Christ as not to
embrace Christ upon his own terms, their blood is upon their own head.
He hath said, Look, and be saved ([Isa
45:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#022).md), look and live. We must take a
complacency in and give consent to the methods which Infinite Wisdom has
taken is saving a guilty world, by the mediation of Jesus Christ, as the
great sacrifice and intercessor.

Fourthly, The great encouragements given us by faith to look up to him.
1. It was for this end that he was lifted up, that his followers might
be saved; and he will pursue his end. 2. The offer that is made of
salvation by him is general, that whosoever believes in him, without
exception, might have benefit by him. 3. The salvation offered is
complete. (1.) They shall not perish, shall not die of their wounds;
though they may be pained and ill frightened, iniquity shall not be
their ruin. But that is not all. (2.) They shall have eternal life. They
shall not only not die of their wounds in the wilderness, but they shall
reach Canaan (which they were then just ready to enter into); they shall
enjoy the promised rest.

\[2.\] Jesus Christ came to save us by pardoning us, that we might not
die by the sentence of the law, [Joh
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016.md), [Joh
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#017.md). Here is gospel indeed, good
news, the best that ever came from heaven to earth. Here is much, here
is all in a little, the word of reconciliation in miniature.

First, Here is God's love in giving his Son for the world ([Joh
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016).md), where we have three things: -
1. The great gospel mystery revealed: God so loved the world that he
gave his only-begotten Son. The love of God the Father is the original
of our regeneration by the Spirit and our reconciliation by the lifting
up of the Son. Note, (1.) Jesus Christ is the only-begotten Son of God.
This magnifies his love in giving him for us, in giving him to us; now
know we that he loves us, when he has given his only-begotten Son for
us, which expresses not only his dignity in himself, but his dearness to
his Father; he was always his delight. (2.) In order to the redemption
and salvation of man, it pleased God to give his only-begotten Son. He
not only sent him into the world with full and ample power to negotiate
a peace between heaven and earth, but he gave him, that is, he gave him
up to suffer and die for us, as the great propitiation or expiatory
sacrifice. It comes in here as a reason why he must be lifted up; for so
it was determined and designed by the Father, who gave him for this
purpose, and prepared him a body in order to it. His enemies could not
have taken him if his Father had not given him. Though he was not yet
crucified, yet in the determinate counsel of God he was given up, [Act
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#023.md). Nay, further, God has given him,
that is, he has made an offer of him, to all, and given him to all true
believers, to all the intents and purposes of the new covenant. He has
given him to be our prophet, a witness to the people, the high priest of
our profession, to be our peace, to be head of the church and head over
all things to the church, to be to us all we need. (3.) Herein God has
commended his love to the world: God so loved the world, so really, so
richly. Now his creatures shall see that he loves them, and wishes them
well. He so loved the world of fallen man as he did not love that of
fallen angels; see [Rom 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#008.md); [Jo1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010.md). Behold, and wonder, that the
great God should love such a worthless world! That the holy God should
love such a wicked world with a love of good will, when he could not
look upon it with any complacency. This was a time of love indeed, [Eze
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#006.md), [Eze
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#008.md). The Jews vainly conceited that
the Messiah should be sent only in love to their nation, and to advance
them upon the ruins of their neighbours; but Christ tells them that he
came in love to the whole world, Gentiles as well as Jews, [Jo1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002.md). Though many of the world of
mankind perish, yet God's giving his only-begotten Son was an instance
of his love to the whole world, because through him there is a general
offer of life and salvation made to all. It is love to the revolted
rebellious province to issue out a proclamation of pardon and indemnity
to all that will come in, plead it upon their knees, and return to their
allegiance. So far God loved the apostate lapsed world that he sent his
Son with this fair proposal, that whosoever believes in him, one or
other, shall not perish. Salvation has been of the Jews, but now Christ
is known as salvation to the ends of the earth, a common salvation. 2.
Here is the great gospel duty, and that is to believe in Jesus Christ
(Whom God has thus given, given for us, given to us), to accept the
gift, and answer the intention of the giver. We must yield an unfeigned
assent and consent to the record God hath given in his word concerning
his Son. God having given him to us to be our prophet, priest, and king,
we must give up ourselves to be ruled, and taught, and saved by him. 3.
Here is the great gospel benefit: That whosoever believes in Christ
shall not perish. This he had said before, and here repeats it. It is
the unspeakable happiness of all true believers, for which they are
eternally indebted to Christ, (1.) That they are saved from the miseries
of hell, delivered from going down to the pit; they shall not perish.
God has taken away their sin, they shall not die; a pardon is purchased,
and so the attainder is reversed. (2.) They are entitled to the joys of
heaven: they shall have everlasting life. The convicted traitor is not
only pardoned, but preferred, and made a favourite, and treated as one
whom the King of kings delights to honour. Out of prison he comes to
reign, [Ecc 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#014.md). If believers, then
children; and, if children, then heirs.

Secondly, Here is God's design in sending hi Son into the world: it was
that the world through him might be saved. He came into the world with
salvation in his eye, with salvation in his hand. Therefore the
aforementioned offer of live and salvation is sincere, and shall be made
good to all that by faith accept it ([Joh
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#017).md): God sent his Son into the
world, this guilty, rebellious, apostate world; sent him as his agent or
ambassador, not as sometimes he had sent angels into the world as
visitants, but as resident. Ever since man sinned, he has dreaded the
approach and appearance of any special messenger from heaven, as being
conscious of guilt and looking for judgment: We shall surely die, for we
have seen God. If therefore the Son of God himself come, we are
concerned to enquire on what errand he comes: Is it peace? Or, as they
asked Samuel trembling, Comest thou peaceably? And this scripture
returns the answer, Peaceably. 1. He did not come to condemn the world.
We had reason enough to expect that he should, for it is a guilty world;
it is convicted, and what cause can be shown why judgment should not be
given, and execution awarded, according to law? That one blood of which
all nations of men are made ([Act
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#026).md) is not only tainted with an
hereditary disease, like Gehazi's leprosy, but it is tainted with an
hereditary guilt, like that of the Amalekites, with whom God had war
from generation to generation; and justly may such a world as this be
condemned; and if God would have sent to condemn it he had angels at
command, to pour out the vials of his wrath, a cherub with a flaming
sword ready to do execution. If the Lord had been pleased to kill us, he
would not have sent his Son amongst us. He came with full powers indeed
to execute judgment ([Joh 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022.md), [Joh
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027).md), but did not begin with a
judgment of condemnation, did not proceed upon the outlawry, nor take
advantage against us for the breach of the covenant of innocency, but
put us upon a new trial before a throne of grace. 2. He came that the
world through him might be saved, that a door of salvation might be
opened to the world, and whoever would might enter in by it. God was in
Christ reconciling the world to himself, and so saving it. An act of
indemnity is passed and published, through Christ a remedial law made,
and the world of mankind dealt with, not according to the rigours of the
first covenant, but according to the riches of the second; that the
world through him might be saved, for it could never be saved but
through him; there is not salvation in any other. This is good news to a
convinced conscience, healing to broken bones and bleeding wounds, that
Christ, our judge, came not to condemn, but to save.

\[3.\] From all this is inferred the happiness of true believers: He
that believeth on him is not condemned, [Joh
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#018.md). Though he has been a sinner, a
great sinner, and stands convicted (habes confilentem reum - by his own
confession), yet, upon his believing, process is stayed, judgment is
arrested, and he is not condemned. This denotes more than a reprieve; he
is not condemned, that is, he is acquitted; he stand upon his
deliverance (as we say), and if he be not condemned he is discharged; ou
krinetai - he is not judged, not dealt with in strict justice, according
to the desert of his sins. He is accused, and he cannot plead not guilty
to the indictment, but he can plead in bar, can plead a noli prosequi
upon the indictment, as blessed Paul does, Who is he that condemns? It
is Christ that died. He is afflicted, chastened of God, persecuted by
the world; but he is not condemned. The cross perhaps lies heavy upon
him, but he is saved from the curse: condemned by the world, it may be,
but not condemned with the world, [Rom
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001.md); [Co1
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#032.md).

4\. Christ, in the close, discourses concerning the deplorable condition
of those that persist in unbelief and wilful ignorance, [Joh
3:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#018.md).

(1.) Read here the doom of those that will not believe in Christ: they
are condemned already. Observe, \[1.\] How great the sin of unbelievers
is; it is aggravated from the dignity of the person they slight; they
believe not in the name of the only-begotten Son of God, who is
infinitely true, and deserves to be believed, infinitely good, and
deserves to be embraced. God sent one to save us that was dearest to
himself; and shall not he be dearest to us? Shall we not believe on his
name who has a name above every name? \[2.\] How great the misery of
unbelievers is: they are condemned already; which bespeaks, First, A
certain condemnation. They are as sure to be condemned in the judgment
of the great day as if they were condemned already. Secondly, A present
condemnation. The curse has already taken hold of them; the wrath of God
now fastens upon them. They are condemned already, for their own hearts
condemn them. Thirdly, A condemnation grounded upon their former guilt:
He is condemned already, for he lies open to the law for all his sins;
the obligation of the law is in full force, power, and virtue, against
him, because he is not by faith interested in the gospel defeasance; he
is condemned already, because he has not believed. Unbelief may truly be
called the great damning sin, because it leaves us under the guilt of
all our other sins; it is a sin against the remedy, against our appeal.

(2.) Read also the doom of those that would not so much as know him,
[Joh 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019.md). Many inquisitive people had
knowledge of Christ and his doctrine and miracles, but they were
prejudiced against him, and would not believe in him, while the
generality were sottishly careless and stupid, and would not know him.
And this is the condemnation, the sin that ruined them, that light is
come into the world, and they loved darkness rather. Now here observe,
\[1.\] That the gospel is light, and, when the gospel came, light came
into the world, Light is self-evidencing, so is the gospel; it proves
its own divine origin. Light is discovering, and truly the light is
sweet, and rejoices the heart. It is a light shining in a dark place,
and a dark place indeed the world would be without it. It is come into
all the world ([Col 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006).md), and not
confined to one corner of it, as the Old Testament light was. \[2.\] It
is the unspeakable folly of the most of men that they loved darkness
rather than light, rather than this light. The Jews loved the dark
shadows of their law, and the instructions of their blind guides, rather
than the doctrine of Christ. The Gentiles loved their superstitious
services of an unknown God, whom they ignorantly worshipped, rather than
the reasonable service which the gospel enjoins. Sinners that were
wedded to their lusts loved their ignorance and mistakes, which
supported them in their sins, rather than the truths of Christ, which
would have parted them from their sins. Man's apostasy began in an
affectation of forbidden knowledge, but is kept up by an affectation of
forbidden ignorance. Wretched man is in love with his sickness, in love
with his slavery, and will not be made free, will not be made whole.
\[3.\] The true reason why men love darkness rather than light is
because their deeds are evil. They love darkness because they think it
is an excuse for their evil deeds, and they hate the light because it
robs them of the good opinion they had of themselves, by showing them
their sinfulness and misery. Their case is sad, and, because they are
resolved that they will not mend it, they are resolved that they will
not see it. \[4.\] Wilful ignorance is so far from excusing sin that it
will be found, at the great day, to aggravate the condemnation: This is
the condemnation, this is what ruins souls, that they shut their eyes
against the light, and will not so much as admit a parley with Christ
and his gospel; they set God so much at defiance that they desire not
the knowledge of his ways, [Job 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#014.md).
We must account in the judgment, not only for the knowledge we had, and
used not, but for the knowledge we might have had, and would not; not
only for the knowledge we sinned against, but for the knowledge we
sinned away. For the further illustration of this he shows ([Joh
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020.md), [Joh
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021).md) that according as men's hearts
and lives are good or bad, so they stand affected to the light Christ
has brought into the world.

First, It is not strange if those that do evil, and resolve to persist
in it, hate the light of Christ's gospel; for it is a common observation
that every one that doeth evil hateth the light, [Joh
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020.md). Evil-doers seek concealment, out
of a sense of shame and fear of punishment; see [Job
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#013.md), etc. Sinful works are works of
darkness; sin from the first affected concealment, [Job
31:33](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#033.md). The light shakes the wicked,
[Job 38:12](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#012.md), [Job
38:13](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#013.md). Thus the gospel is a terror to
the wicked world: They come not to this light, but keep as far off it as
they can, lest their deeds should be reproved. Note, 1. The light of the
gospel is sent into the world to reprove the evil deeds of sinners; to
make them manifest ([Eph 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#013).md), to
show people their transgressions, to show that to be sin which was not
thought to be so, and to show them the evil of their transgressions,
that sin by the new commandment might appear exceeding sinful. The
gospel has its convictions, to make way for its consolations. 2. It is
for this reason that evil-doers hate the light of the gospel. There were
those who had done evil and were sorry for it, who bade this light
welcome, as the publicans and harlots. But he that does evil, that does
it and resolves to go on in it, hateth the light, cannot bear to be told
of his faults. All that opposition which the gospel of Christ has met
with in the world comes from the wicked heart, influenced by the wicked
one. Christ is hated because sin is loved. 3. They who do not come to
the light thereby evidence a secret hatred of the light. If they had not
an antipathy to saving knowledge, they would not sit down so contentedly
in damning ignorance.

Secondly, On the other hand, upright hearts, that approve themselves to
God in their integrity, bid this light welcome ([Joh
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021).md): He that doeth truth cometh to
the light. It seems, then, that though the gospel had many enemies it
had some friends. It is a common observation that truth seeks no
corners. Those who mean and act honestly dread not a scrutiny, but
desire it rather. Now this is applicable to the gospel light; as it
convinces and terrifies evil-doers, so it confirms and comforts those
that walk in their integrity. Observe here, 1. The character of a good
man. (1.) He is one that doeth truth; that is, he acts truly and
sincerely in all he does. Though sometimes he comes short of doing good,
the good he would do, yet he doeth truth, he aims honestly; he has his
infirmities, but holds fast his integrity; as Gaius, that did faithfully
([Jo3 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#005).md), as Paul ([Co2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012).md), as Nathanael ([Joh
1:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#047).md), as Asa, [Kg1
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#014). (2..md) He is one that cometh to
the light. He is ready to receive and entertain divine revelation as far
as it appears to him to be so, what uneasiness soever it may create him.
He that doeth truth is willing to know the truth by himself, and to have
his deeds made manifest. A good man is much employed in trying himself,
and is desirous that God would try him, [Psa
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#002.md). He is solicitous to know what
the will of God is, and resolves to do it, though ever so contrary to
his own will and interest. 2. Here is the character of a good work: it
is wrought in God, in union with him by a covenanting faith, and in
communion with him by devout affections. Our works are then good, and
will bear the test, when the will of God is the rule of them and the
glory of God the end of them; when they are done in his strength, and
for his sake, to him, and not to men; and if, by the light of the
gospel, it be manifest to us that our works are thus wrought, then shall
we have rejoicing, [Gal 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#004.md); [Co2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012.md).

[John 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 3:22</span></span>

In these verses we have,

I. Christ's removal into the land of Judea ([Joh
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#022).md), and there he tarried with his
disciples. Observe, 1. Our Lord Jesus, after he entered upon his public
work, travelled much, and removed often, as the patriarchs in their
sojournings. As it was a good part of his humiliation that he had no
certain dwelling-place, but was, as Paul, in journeyings often, so it
was an instance of his unwearied industry, in the work for which he came
into the world, that he went about in prosecution of it; many a weary
step he took to do good to souls. The Sun of righteousness took a large
circuit to diffuse his light and heat, [Psa
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#006.md). 2. He was not wont to stay long
at Jerusalem. Though he went frequently thither, yet he soon returned
into the country; as here. After these things, after he had had this
discourse with Nicodemus, he came into the land of Judea; not so much
for greater privacy (though mean and obscure places best suited the
humble Jesus in his humble state) as for greater usefulness. His
preaching and miracles, perhaps, made most noise at Jerusalem, the
fountain-head of news, but did least good there, where the most
considerable men of the Jewish church had so much the ascendant. 3. When
he came into the land of Judea his disciples came with him; for these
were they that continued with him in his temptations. Many that flocked
to him at Jerusalem could not follow his motions into the country, they
had no business there; but his disciples attended him. If the ark
remove, it is better to remove and go after it (as those did, [Jos
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#003).md) than sit still without it, though
it be in Jerusalem itself. 4. There he tarried with them, dietribe - He
conversed with them, discoursed with them. He did not retire into the
country for his ease and pleasure, but for more free conversation with
his disciples and followers. See [Sol
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#011.md), [Sol
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#012.md). Note, Those that are ready to go
with Christ shall find him as ready to stay with them. It is supposed
that he now staid five or six months in this country. 5. There he
baptized; he admitted disciples, such as believed in him, and had more
honesty and courage than those had at Jerusalem, [Joh
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024.md). John began to baptize in the
land of Judea ([Mat 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001).md), therefore
Christ began there, for John had said, There comes one after me. He
himself baptized not, with his own hand, but his disciples by his orders
and directions, as appears, [Joh 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#002.md).
But his disciples' baptizing was his baptizing. Holy ordinances are
Christ's, though administered by weak men.

II\. John's continuance in his work, as long as his opportunities
laster, [Joh 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#023.md), [Joh
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#024.md). Here we are told,

1\. That John was baptizing. Christ's baptism was, for substance, the
same with John's, for John bore witness to Christ, and therefore they
did not at all clash or interfere with one another. But, (1.) Christ
began the work of preaching and baptizing before John laid it down, that
he might be ready to receive John's disciples when he should be taken
off, and so the wheels might be kept going. It is a comfort to useful
men, when they are going off the stage, to see those rising up who are
likely to fill up their place. (2.) John continued the work of preaching
and baptizing though Christ had taken it up; for he would still,
according to the measure given to him, advance the interests of God's
kingdom. There was still work for John to do, for Christ was not yet
generally known, nor were the minds of people thoroughly prepared for
him by repentance. From heaven John had received his command, and he
would go on in his work till he thence received his countermand, and
would have his dismission from the same hand that gave him his
commission. He does not come in to Christ, lest what had formerly passed
should look like a combination between them; but he goes on with his
work, till Providence lays him aside. The greater gifts of some do not
render the labours of others, that come short of them, needless and
useless; there is work enough for all hands. They are sullen that will
sit down and do nothing when they see themselves out-shone. Though we
have but one talent, we must account for that: and, when we see
ourselves going off, must yet go on to the last.

2\. That he baptized in Enon near Salim, places we find nowhere else
mentioned, and therefore the learned are altogether at a loss where to
find them. Wherever it was, it seems that John removed from place to
place; he did not think that there was any virtue in Jordan, because
Jesus was baptized there, which should engage him to stay there, but as
he saw cause he removed to other waters. Ministers must follow their
opportunities. He chose a place where there was much water, hudata polla
- many waters, that is, many streams of water; so that wherever he met
with any that were willing to submit to his baptism water was at hand to
baptize them with, shallow perhaps, as is usual where there are many
brooks, but such as would serve his purpose. And in that country plenty
of water was a valuable thing.

3\. That thither people came to him and were baptized. Though they did
not come in such vast crowds as they did when he first appeared, yet now
he was not without encouragement, but there were still those that
attended and owned him. Some refer this both to John and to Jesus: They
came and were baptized; that is, some came to John, and were baptized by
him, some to Jesus, and were baptized by him, and, as their baptism was
one, so were their hearts.

4\. It is noted ([Joh 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#024).md) that John
was not yet cast into prison, to clear the order of the story, and to
show that these passages are to come in before [Mat
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#012.md). John never desisted from his
work as long as he had his liberty; nay, he seems to have been the more
industrious, because he foresaw his time was short; he was not yet cast
into prison, but he expected it ere long, [Joh
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#004.md).

III\. A contest between John's disciples and the Jews about purifying,
[Joh 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#025.md). See how the gospel of
Christ came not to send peace upon earth, but division. Observe, 1. Who
were the disputants: some of John's disciples, and the Jews who had not
submitted to his baptism of repentance. Penitents and impenitents divide
this sinful world. In this contest, it should seem, John's disciples
were the aggressors, and gave the challenge; and it is a sign that they
were novices, who had more zeal than discretion. The truths of God have
often suffered by the rashness of those that have undertaken to defend
them before they were able to do it. 2. What was the matter in dispute:
about purifying, about religious washing. (1.) We may suppose that
John's disciples cried up his baptism, his purifying, as instar omnium -
superior to all others, and gave the preference to that as perfecting
and superseding all the purifications of the Jews, and they were in the
right; but young converts are too apt to boast of their attainments,
whereas he that finds the treasure should hide it till he is sure that
he has it, and not talk of it too much at first. (2.) No doubt the Jews
with as much assurance applauded the purifyings that were in use among
them, both those that were instituted by the law of Moses and those that
were imposed by the tradition of the elders; for the former they had a
divine warrant, and for the latter the usage of the church. Now it is
very likely that the Jews in this dispute, when they could not deny the
excellent nature and design of John's baptism, raised an objection
against it from Christ's baptism, which gave occasion for the complaint
that follows here ([Joh 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#026).md): "Here
is John baptizing in one place." say they, "and Jesus at the same time
baptizing in another place; and therefore John's baptism, which his
disciples so much applaud, is either," \[1.\] "Dangerous, and of ill
consequence to the peace of the church and state, for you see it opens a
door to endless parties. Now that John has begun, we shall have every
little teacher set up for a baptist presently. Or," \[2.\] "At the best
it is defective and imperfect. If John's baptism, which you cry up thus,
have any good in it, yonder the baptism of Jesus goes beyond it, so that
for your parts you are shaded already by a greater light, and your
baptism is soon gone out of request." Thus objections are made against
the gospel from the advancement and improvement of gospel light, as if
childhood and manhood were contrary to each other, and the
superstructure were against the foundation. There was no reason to
object Christ's baptism against John's, for they consisted very well
together.

IV\. A complaint which John's disciples made to their master concerning
Christ and his baptizing, [Joh 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#026.md).
They, being nonplussed by the fore-mentioned objection, and probably
ruffled and put into a heat by it, come to their master, and tell him,
"Rabbi, he that was with thee, and was baptized of thee, is now set up
for himself; he baptizeth, and all men come to him; and wilt thou suffer
it?" Their itch for disputing occasioned this. It is common for men,
when they find themselves run aground in the heat of disputation, to
fall foul upon those that do them no harm. If these disciples of John
had not undertaken to dispute about purifying, before they understood
the doctrine of baptism, they might have answered the objection without
being put into a passion. In their complaint, they speak respectfully to
their own master, Rabbi; but speak very slightly of our Saviour, though
they do not name him. 1. They suggest that Christ's setting up a baptism
of his own was a piece of presumption, very unaccountable; as if John,
having first set up this rite of baptizing, must have the monopoly of
it, and, as it were, a patent for the invention: "He that was with thee
beyond Jordan, as a disciple of thine, behold, and wonder, the same, the
very same, baptizes, and takes thy work out of thy hand." Thus the
voluntary condescensions of the Lord Jesus, as that of his being
baptized by John, are often unjustly and very unkindly turned to his
reproach. 2. They suggest that it was a piece of ingratitude to John. He
to whom thou barest witness baptizes; as if Jesus owed all his
reputation to the honourable character John gave of him, and yet had
very unworthily improved it to the prejudice of John. But Christ needed
not John's testimony, [Joh 5:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#036.md). He
reflected more honour upon John than he received from him, yet thus it
is incident to us to think that others are more indebted to us than
really they are. And besides, Christ's baptism was not in the least an
impeachment, but indeed the greatest improvement, of John's baptism,
which was but to lead the way to Christ's. John was just to Christ, in
bearing witness to him; and Christ's answering his testimony did rather
enrich than impoverish John's ministry. 3. They conclude that it would
be a total eclipse to John's baptism: "All men come to him; they that
used to follow with us now flock after him, it is therefore time for us
to look about us." It was not indeed strange that all men came to him.
As far as Christ is manifested he will be magnified; but why should
John's disciples grieve at this? Note, Aiming at the monopoly of honour
and respect has been in all ages the bane of the church, and the shame
of its members and ministers; as also a vying of interests, and a
jealousy of rivalship and competition. We mistake if we think that the
excelling gifts and graces, and labours and usefulness, of one, are a
diminution and disparagement to another that has obtained mercy to be
faithful; for the Spirit is a free agent, dispensing to every one
severally as he will. Paul rejoiced in the usefulness even of those that
opposed him, [Phi 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#018.md). We must leave
it to God to choose, employ, and honour his own instruments as he
pleaseth, and not covet to be placed alone.

V. Here is John's answer to this complaint which his disciples made,
[Joh 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#027.md), etc. His disciples expected
that he would have resented this matter as they did; but Christ's
manifestation to Israel was no surprise to John, but what he looked for;
it was not disturbance to him, but what he wished for. He therefore
checked the complaint, as Moses, Enviest thou for my sake? and took this
occasion to confirm the testimonies he had formerly borne to Christ as
superior to him, cheerfully consigning and turning over to him all the
interest he had in Israel. In this discourse here, the first minister of
the gospel (for so John was) is an excellent pattern to all ministers to
humble themselves and to exalt the Lord Jesus.

1\. John here abases himself in comparison with Christ, [Joh
3:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#027.md). The more others magnify us,
the more we must humble ourselves, and fortify ourselves against the
temptation of flattery and applause, and the jealousy of our friends for
our honour, by remembering our place, and what we are, [Co1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#005.md).

(1.) John acquiesces in the divine disposal, and satisfies himself with
that ([Joh 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#027).md): A man can receive
nothing except it be given him from heaven, whence every good gift comes
([Jam 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017).md), a general truth very
applicable in this case. Different employments are according to the
direction of divine Providence, different endowments according to the
distribution of the divine grace. No man can take any true honour to
himself, [Heb 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#004.md). We have as
necessary and constant a dependence upon the grace of God in all the
motions and actions of the spiritual life as we have upon the providence
of God in all the motions and actions of the natural life: now this
comes in here as a reason, \[1.\] Why we should not envy those that have
a larger share of gifts than we have, or move in a larger sphere of
usefulness. John reminds his disciples that Jesus would not have thus
excelled him except he had received it from heaven, for, as man and
Mediator, he received gifts; and, if God gave him the Spirit without
measure ([Joh 3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034).md), shall they grudge
at it? The same reason will hold as to others. If God is pleased to give
to others more ability and success than to us, shall we be displeased at
it, and reflect upon him as unjust, unwise, and partial? See [Mat
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#015.md). \[2.\] Why we should not be
discontented, though we be inferior to others in gifts and usefulness,
and be eclipsed by their excellencies. John was ready to own that it was
the gift, the free gift, of heaven, that made him a preacher, a prophet,
a baptist: it was God that gave him the interest he had in the love and
esteem of the people; and, if now his interest decline, God's will be
done! He that gives may take. What we receive from heaven we must take
as it is given. Now John never received a commission for a standing
perpetual office, but only for a temporary one, which must soon expire;
and therefore, when he has fulfilled his ministry, he can contentedly
see it go out of date. Some give quite another sense of these words:
John had taken pains with his disciples, to teach them the reference
which his baptism had to Christ, who should come after him, and yet be
preferred before him, and do that for them which he could not do; and
yet, after all, they dote upon John, and grudge this preference of
Christ above him: Well saith John, I see a man can receive (that is,
perceive) nothing, except it be given him from heaven. The labour of
ministers if all lost labour, unless the grace of God make it effectual.
Men do not understand that which is made most plain, nor believe that
which is made most evident, unless it be given them from heaven to
understand and believe it.

(2.) John appeals to the testimony he had formerly given concerning
Christ ([Joh 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#028).md): You can bear me
witness that I said, again and again, I am not the Christ, but I am sent
before him. See how steady and constant John was in his testimony to
Christ, and not as a reed shaken with the wind; neither the frowns of
the chief priests, nor the flatteries of his own disciples, could make
him change his note. Now this serves here, \[1.\] As a conviction to his
disciples of the unreasonableness of their complaint. They had spoken of
the witness which their master bore to Jesus ([Joh
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#026).md): "Now," saith John, "do you not
remember what the testimony was that I did bear? Call that to mind, and
you will see your own cavil answered. Did I not say, I am not the
Christ? Why then do you set me up as a rival with him that is? Did I not
say, I am sent before him? Why then does it seem strange to you that I
should stand by and give way to him?" \[2.\] It is a comfort to himself
that he had never given his disciples any occasion thus to set him up in
competition with Christ; but, on the contrary, had particularly
cautioned them against this mistake, though he might have made a hand of
it for himself. It is a satisfaction to faithful ministers when they
have done what they could in their places to prevent any extravagances
that their people ran into. John had not only not encouraged them to
hope that he was the Messiah, but had plainly told them the contrary,
which was now a satisfaction to him. It is a common excuse for those who
have undue honour paid them, Si populus vult decipi, decipiatur - If the
people will be deceived, let them; but that is an ill maxim for those to
go by whose business it is to undeceive people. The lip of truth shall
be established.

(3.) John professes the great satisfaction he had in the advancement of
Christ and his interest. He was so far from regretting it, as his
disciples did, that he rejoiced in it. This he expresses ([Joh
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#029).md) by an elegant similitude. \[1.\]
He compares our Saviour to the bridegroom: "He that hath the bride is
the bridegroom. Do all men come to him? It is well, whither else should
they go? Has he got the throne in men's affections? Who else should have
it? It is his right; to whom should the bride be brought but to the
bridegroom?" Christ was prophesied of in the Old Testament as a
bridegroom, Ps. 45. The Word was made flesh, that the disparity of
nature might not be a bar to the match. Provision is made for the
purifying of the church, that the defilement of sin might be no bar.
Christ espouses his church to himself; he has the bride, for he has her
love, he has her promise; the church is subject to Christ. As far as
particular souls are devoted to him in faith and love, so far the
bridegroom has the bride. \[2.\] He compares himself to the friend of
the bridegroom, who attends upon him, to do him honour and service,
assists him in prosecuting the match, speaks a good word for him, uses
his interest on his behalf, rejoices when the match goes on, and most of
all when the point is gained, and he has the bride. All that John had
done in preaching and baptizing was to introduce him; and, now that he
was come, he had what he wished for: The friend of the bridegroom
stands, and hears him; stands expecting him, and waiting for him;
rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom's voice, because he is come
to the marriage after he had been long expected. Note, First, Faithful
ministers are friends of the bridegroom, to recommend him to the
affections and choice of the children of men; to bring letters and
messages from him, for he courts by proxy; and herein they must be
faithful to him. Secondly, The friends of the bridegroom must stand, and
hear the bridegroom's voice; must receive instructions from him, and
attend his orders; must desire to have proofs of Christ speaking in
them, and with them ([Co2 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#003).md); that
is the bridegroom's voice. Thirdly, The espousing of souls to Jesus
Christ, in faith and love, is the fulfilling of the joy of every good
minister. If the day of Christ's espousals be the day of the gladness of
his heart ([Sol 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#011).md), it cannot but
be of their too who love him and wish well to his honour and kingdom.
Surely they have no greater joy.

(4.) He owns it highly fit and necessary that the reputation and
interest of Christ should be advanced, and his own diminished ([Joh
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#030).md): He must increase, but I must
decrease. If they grieve at the growing greatness of the Lord Jesus,
they will have more and more occasion to grieve, as those have that
indulge themselves in envy and emulation. John speaks of Christ's
increase and his own decrease, not only as necessary and unavoidable,
which could not be helped and therefore must be borne, but as highly
just and agreeable, and affording him entire satisfaction. \[1.\] He was
well pleased to see the kingdom of Christ getting ground: "He must
increase. You think he has gained a great deal, but it is nothing to
what he will gain." Note, The kingdom of Christ is, and will be, a
growing kingdom, like the light of the morning, like the grain of
mustard-seed. \[2.\] He was not at all displeased that the effect of
this was the diminishing of his own interest: I must decrease. Created
excellencies are under this law, they must decrease. I have seen an end
of all perfection. Note, First, The shining forth of the glory of Christ
eclipses the lustre of all other glory. The glory that stands in
competition with Christ, that of the world and the flesh, decreases and
loses ground in the soul as the knowledge and love of Christ increase
and get ground; but it is here spoken of that which is subservient to
him. As the light of the morning increases, that of the morning star
decreases. Secondly, If our diminution or abasement may but in the least
contribute to the advancement of Christ's name, we must cheerfully
submit to it, and be content to be any thing, to be nothing, so that
Christ may be all.

2\. John Baptist here advances Christ, and instructs his disciples
concerning him, that, instead of grieving that so many come to him, they
might come to him themselves.

(1.) He instructs them concerning the dignity of Christ's person ([Joh
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#031).md): He that cometh from above, that
cometh from heaven, is above all. Here, \[1.\] He supposes his divine
origin, that he came from above, from heaven, which bespeaks not only
his divine extraction, but his divine nature. He had a being before his
conception, a heavenly being. None but he that came from heaven was fit
to show us the will of heaven, or the way to heaven. When God would save
man, he sent from above. \[2.\] Hence he infers his sovereign authority:
he is above all, above all things and all persons, God over all, blessed
for evermore. It is daring presumption to dispute precedency with him.
When we come to speak of the honours of the Lord Jesus, we find they
transcend all conception and expression, and we can say but this, He is
above all. It was said of John Baptist, There is not a greater among
them that are born of women. But the descent of Christ from heaven put
such a dignity upon him as he was not divested of by his being made
flesh; still he was above all. This he further illustrates by the
meanness of those who stood in competition with him: He that is of the
earth, is earthly, ho ōn ek tēs gēŝ ek tēs gēs esti - He that is of the
earth is of the earth; he that has his origin of the earth has his food
out of the earth, has his converse with earthly things, and his concern
is for them. Note, First, Man has his rise out of the earth; not only
Adam at first, but we also still are formed out of the clay, [Job
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#006.md). Look to the rock whence we were
hewn. Secondly, Man's constitution is therefore earthly; not only his
body frail and mortal, but his soul corrupt and carnal, and its bent and
bias strong towards earthly things. The prophets and apostles were of
the same mould with other men; they were but earthen vessels, though
they had a rich treasure lodged in them; and shall these be set up as
rivals with Christ? Let the potsherds strive with the potsherds of the
earth; but let them not cope with him that came from heaven.

(2.) Concerning the excellency and certainty of his doctrine. His
disciples were displeased that Christ's preaching was admired, and
attended upon, more than his; but he tells them that there was reason
enough for it. For,

\[1.\] He, for his part, spoke of the earth, and so do all those that
are of the earth. The prophets were men and spoke like men; of
themselves they could not speak but of the earth, [Co2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#005.md). The preaching of the prophets and
of John was but low and flat compared with Christ's preaching; as heaven
is high above the earth, so were his thoughts above theirs. By them God
spoke on earth, but in Christ he speaketh from heaven.

\[2.\] But he that cometh from heaven is not only in his person, but in
his doctrine, above all the prophets that ever lived on earth; none
teacheth like him. The doctrine of Christ is here recommended to us,

First, As infallibly sure and certain, and to be entertained accordingly
([Joh 3:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#032).md): What he hath seen and
heard, that he testifieth. See here, 1. Christ's divine knowledge; he
testified nothing but what he had seen and heard, what he was perfectly
apprized of and thoroughly acquainted with. What he discovered of the
divine nature and of the invisible world was what he had seen; what he
revealed of the mind of God was what he had heard immediately from him,
and not at second hand. The prophets testified what was made known to
them in creams and visions by the mediation of angels, but not what they
had seen and heard. John was the crier's voice, that said, "Make room
for the witness, and keep silence while the charge is given," but then
leaves it to the witness to give in his testimony himself, and the judge
to give the charge himself. The gospel of Christ is not a doubtful
opinion, like an hypothesis or new notion in philosophy, which every one
is at liberty to believe or not; but it is a revelation of the mind of
God, which is of eternal truth in itself, and of infinite concern to us.
2. His divine grace and goodness: that which he had seen and heard he
was pleased to make known to us, because he knew it nearly concerned us.
What Paul had seen and heard in the third heavens he could not testify
([Co2 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#004).md), but Christ knew how to
utter what he had seen and heard. Christ's preaching is here called his
testifying, to denote, (1.) The convincing evidence of it; it was not
reported as news by hearsay, but it was testified as evidence given in
court, with great caution and assurance. (2.) The affectionate
earnestness of the delivery of it: it was testified with concern and
importunity, as [Act 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005.md).

From the certainty of Christ's doctrine, John takes occasion, \[1.\] To
lament the infidelity of the most of men: though he testifies what is
infallibly true, yet no man receiveth his testimony, that is, very few,
next to none, none in comparison with those that refuse it. They receive
it not, they will not hear it, they do not heed it, or give credit to
it. This he speaks of not only as a matter of wonder, that such a
testimony should not be received (Who hath believed our report? How
stupid and foolish are the greatest part of mankind, what enemies to
themselves!) but as matter of grief; John's disciples grieved that all
men came to Christ ([Joh 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#026).md); they
thought his followers too many. But John grieves that no man came to
him; he thought them too few. Note, The unbelief of sinners is the grief
of saints. It was for this that St. Paul had great heaviness, [Rom
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#002.md). \[2.\] He takes occasion to
commend the faith of the chosen remnant ([Joh
3:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#033).md): He that hath received his
testimony (and some such there were, though very few) hath set to his
seal that God is true. God is true, though we do not set our seal to it;
let God be true, and every man a liar; his truth needs not our faith to
support it, but by faith we do ourselves the honour and justice to
subscribe to his truth, and hereby God reckons himself honoured. God's
promises are all yea and amen; by faith we put our amen to them, as [Rev
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#020.md). Observe, He that receives the
testimony of Christ subscribes not only to the truth of Christ, but to
the truth of God, for his name is the Word of God; the commandments of
God and the testimony of Christ are put together, [Rev
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#017.md). By believing in Christ we set
to our seal, First, That God is true to all the promises which he has
made concerning Christ, that which he spoke by the mouth of all his holy
prophets; what he swore to our fathers is all accomplished, and not one
iota or tittle of it fallen to the ground, [Luk
1:70](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#070.md), etc. [Act
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#032.md), [Act
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033.md). Secondly, That he is true to
all the promises he has made in Christ; we venture our souls upon God's
veracity, being satisfied that he is true; we are willing to deal with
him upon trust, and to quit all in this world for a happiness in
reversion and out of sight. By this we greatly honour God's
faithfulness. Whom we give credit to we give honour to.

Secondly, It is recommended to us as a divine doctrine; not his own, but
his that sent him ([Joh 3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034).md): For he
whom God hath sent speaketh the word of God, which he was sent to speak,
and enabled to speak; for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.
The prophets were as messengers that brought letters from heaven; but
Christ came under the character of an ambassador, and treats with us as
such; for, 1. He spoke the words of God, and nothing he said savoured of
human infirmity; both substance and language were divine. He proved
himself sent of God ([Joh 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#002).md), and
therefore his words are to be received as the words of God. By this rule
we may try the spirits: those that speak as the oracles of God, and
prophesy according to the proportion of faith, are to be received as
sent of God. 2. He spoke as no other prophet did; for God giveth not the
Spirit by measure to him. None can speak the words of God without the
Spirit of God, [Co1 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010.md), [Co1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#011.md). The Old Testament prophets had
the Spirit, and in different degrees, [Kg2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#009.md), [Kg2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#010.md). But, whereas God gave them the
Spirit by measure ([Co1 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004).md), he gave
him to Christ without measure; all fulness dwelt in him, the fulness of
the Godhead, an immeasurable fulness. The Spirit was not in Christ as in
a vessel, but as in a fountain, as in a bottomless ocean. "The prophets
that had the Spirit in a limited manner, only with respect to some
particular revelation, sometimes spoke of themselves; but he that had
the Spirit always residing in him, without stint, always spoke the words
of God." So Dr. Whitby.

(3.) Concerning the power and authority he is invested with, which gives
him the pre-eminence above all others, and a more excellent name than
they.

\[1.\] He is the beloved Son of the Father ([Joh
3:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#035).md): The Father loveth the Son. The
prophets were faithful as servants, but Christ as a Son; they were
employed as servants, but Christ beloved as a son, always his delight,
[Pro 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#030.md). The Father was well pleased
in him; not only he did love him, but he doth love him; he continued his
love to him even in his estate of humiliation, loved him never the less
for his poverty and sufferings.

\[2.\] He is Lord of all. The Father, as an evidence of his love for
him, hath given all things into his hand. Love is generous. The Father
took such a complacency and had such a confidence in him that he
constituted him the great feoffee in trust for mankind. Having given him
the Spirit without measure, he gave him all things; for he was hereby
qualified to be master and manager of all. Note, It is the honour of
Christ, and the unspeakable comfort of all Christians, that the Father
hath given all things into the hands of the Mediator. First, All power;
so it is explained, [Mat 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md). All
the works of creation being put under his feet, all the affairs of
redemption are put into his hand; he is Lord of all. Angels are his
servants; devils are his captives. He has power over all flesh, the
heathen given him for his inheritance. The kingdom of providence is
committed to his administration. He has power to settle the terms of the
covenant of peace as the great plenipotentiary, to govern his church as
the great lawgiver, to dispense divine favours as the great almoner, and
to call all to account as the great Judge. Both the golden sceptre and
the iron rod are given into his hand. Secondly, All grace is given into
his hand as the channel of conveyance; all things, all those good things
which God intended to give to the children of men; eternal life, and all
its preliminaries. We are unworthy that the Father should give those
things into our hands, for we have made ourselves the children of his
wrath; he hath therefore appointed the Son of his love to be trustee for
us, and the things he intended for us he gives into his hands, who is
worthy, and has merited both honours for himself and favours for us.
They are given into his hands, by him to be given into ours. This is a
great encouragement to faith, that the riches of the new covenant are
deposited in so sure, so kind, so good a hand, the hand of him that
purchased them for us, and us for himself, who is able to keep all that
which both God and believers have agreed to commit to him.

\[3.\] He is the object of that faith which is made the great condition
of eternal happiness, and herein he has the pre-eminence above all
others: He that believeth on the Son, hath life, [Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036.md). We have here the application of
what he had said concerning Christ and his doctrine; and it is the
conclusion of the whole matter. If God has put this honour upon the Son,
we must by faith give honour to him. As God offers and conveys good
things to us by the testimony of Jesus Christ, whose word is the vehicle
of divine favours, so we receive and partake of those favours by
believing the testimony, and entertaining that word as true and good;
this way of receiving fitly answers that way of giving. We have here the
sum of that gospel which is to be preached to every creature, [Mar
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#016.md). Here is,

First, The blessed state of all true Christians: He that believes on the
Son hath everlasting life. Note, 1. It is the character of every true
Christian that he believes on the Son of God; not only believes him,
that what he saith is true, but believes on him, consents to him, and
confides in him. The benefit of true Christianity is no less than
everlasting life; this is what Christ came to purchase for us and confer
upon us; it can be no less than the happiness of an immortal soul in an
immortal God. 2. True believers, even now, have everlasting life; not
only they shall have it hereafter, but they have it now. For, (1.) They
have very good security for it. The deed by which it passeth is sealed
and delivered to them, and so they have it; it is put into the hands of
their guardian for them, and so they have it, though the use be not yet
transferred into possession. They have the Son of God, and in him they
have life; and the Spirit of God, the earnest of this life. (2.) They
have the comfortable foretastes of it, in present communion with God and
the tokens of his love. Grace is glory begun.
