### [Jeremiah Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 42:0</span></span>

Johanan and the captains being strongly bent upon going into Egypt,
either their affections or politics advising them to take that course,
they had a great desire that God should direct them to do so too like
Balaam, who, when he was determined to go and curse Israel, asked God
leave. Here is, I. The fair bargain that was made between Jeremiah and
them about consulting God in this matter ([Jer
42:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#001).md). II. The message at large
which God sent them, in answer to their enquiry, in which, 1. They are
commanded and encouraged to continue in the land of Judah, and assured
that if they did so it should be well with them ([Jer
42:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#007).md). 2. They are forbidden to go
to Egypt, and are plainly told that if they did it would be their ruin
([Jer 42:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#013).md). 3. They are charged
with dissimulation in their asking what God's will was in this matter
and disobedience when they were told what it was; and sentence is
accordingly passed upon them ([Jer
42:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#019).md).

[Jeremiah 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 42:1</span></span>

We have reason to wonder how Jeremiah the prophet escaped the sword of
Ishmael; it seems he did escape, and it was not the first time that the
Lord hid him. It is strange also that in these violent turns he was not
consulted before now, and his advice asked and taken. But it should seem
as if they knew not that a prophet was among them. Though this people
were as brands plucked out of the fire, yet have they not returned to
the Lord. This people has a revolting and a rebellious heart; and
contempt of God and his providence, God and his prophets, is still the
sin that most easily besets them. But now at length, to serve a turn,
Jeremiah is sought out, and all the captains, Johanan himself not
excepted, with all the people from the least to the greatest, make him a
visit; they came near ([Jer 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#001).md),
which intimates that hitherto they had kept at a distance from the
prophet and had been shy of him. Now here,

I. They desire him by prayer to ask direction from God what they should
do in the present critical juncture, [Jer
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#002.md), [Jer
42:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#003.md). They express themselves
wonderfully well. 1. With great respect to the prophet. Though he was
poor and low, and under their command, yet they apply to him with
humility and submissiveness, as petitioners for his assistance, which
yet they intimate their own unworthiness of: Let, we beseech thee, our
supplication be accepted before thee. They compliment him thus in hopes
to persuade him to say as they would have him say. 2. With a great
opinion of his interest in heaven: "Pray for us, who know not how to
pray for ourselves. Pray to the Lord thy God, for we are unworthy to
call him ours, nor have we reason to expect any favour from him." 3.
With a great sense of their need of divine direction. They speak of
themselves as objects of compassion: "We are but a remnant, but a few of
many; how easily will such a remnant be swallowed up, and yet it is a
pity that it should. Thy eyes see what distress we are in, what a plunge
we are at; if thou canst do any thing, help us." 4. With desire of
divine direction: "Let the Lord thy God take this ruin into his thoughts
and under his hand, and show us the way wherein we may walk and may
expect to have his presence with us, and the thing that we may do, the
course we may take for our own safety." Note, In every difficult
doubtful case our eye must be up to God for direction. They then might
expect to be directed by a spirit of prophecy, which has now ceased; but
we may still in faith pray to be guided by a spirit of wisdom in our
hearts and the hints of Providence.

II\. Jeremiah faithfully promises them to pray for direction for them,
and, whatever message God should send to them by him, he would deliver
it to them just as he received it without adding, altering, or
diminishing, [Jer 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#004.md). Ministers may
hence learn, 1. Conscientiously to pray for those who desire their
prayers: I will pray for you according to your words. Though they had
slighted him, yet, like Samuel when he was slighted, he will not sin
against the Lord in ceasing to pray for them, [Sa1
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#023.md). 2. Conscientiously to advise
those who desire their advice as near as they can to the mind of God,
not keeping back any thing that is profitable for them, whether it be
pleasing or no, but to declare to them the whole counsel of God, that
they may approve themselves true to their trust.

III\. They fairly promise that they will be governed by the will of God,
as soon as they know what it is ([Jer
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#005.md), [Jer
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#006).md), and they had the impudence to
appeal to God concerning their sincerity herein, though at the same time
they dissembled: "The Lord be a true and faithful witness between us; do
thou in the fear of God tell us truly what his mind is and then we will
in the fear of God comply with it, and for this the Lord the Judge be
Judge between us." Note, Those that expect to have the benefit of good
ministers' prayers must conscientiously hearken to their preaching and
be governed by it, as far as it agrees with the mind of God. Nothing
could be better than this was: Whether it be good, or whether it be
evil, we will obey the voice of the Lord our God, that it may be well
with us. 1. They now call God their God, for Jeremiah had encouraged
them to call him so ([Jer 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#004).md): I
will pray to the Lord your God. He is ours, and therefore we will obey
his voice. Our relation to God strongly obliges us to obedience. 2. They
promise to obey his voice because they sent the prophet to him to
consult him. Note, We do not truly desire to know the mind of God if we
do not fully resolve to comply with it when we do know it. 3. It is an
implicit universal obedience that they here promise. They will do what
God appoints them to do, whether it be good or whether it be evil:
"Though it may seem evil to us, yet we will believe that if God command
it it is certainly good, and we must not dispute it, but do it. Whatever
God commands, whether it be easy or difficult, agreeable to our
inclinations or contrary to them, whether it be cheap or costly,
fashionable or unfashionable, whether we get or lose by it in our
worldly interests, if it be our duty, we will do it." 4. It is upon a
very good consideration that they promise this, a reasonable and
powerful one, that it may be well with us, which intimates a conviction
that they could not expect it should be well with them upon any other
terms.

[Jeremiah 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 42:7</span></span>

We have here the answer which Jeremiah was sent to deliver to those who
employed him to ask counsel of God.

I. It did not come immediately, not till ten days after, [Jer
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#007.md). They were thus long held in
suspense, perhaps, to punish them for their hypocrisy or to show that
Jeremiah did not speak of himself, nor what he would, for he could not
speak when he would, but must wait for instructions. However, it teaches
us to continue waiting upon God for direction in our way. The vision is
for an appointed time, and at the end it shall speak.

II\. When it did come he delivered it publicly, both to the captains and
to all the people, from the meanest to those in the highest station; he
delivered it fully and faithfully as he received it, as he had promised
that he would keep nothing back from them. If Jeremiah had been to
direct them by his own prudence, perhaps he could not have told what to
advise them to, the case was so difficult; but what he has to advise is
what the Lord the God of Israel saith, to whom they had sent him, and
therefore they were bound in honour and duty to observe it. And this he
tells them,

1\. That it is the will of God that they should stay where they are, and
his promise that, if they do so, it shall undoubtedly be well with them
he would have them still to abide in this land, [Jer
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#010.md). Their brethren were forced out
of it into captivity, and this was their affliction; let those therefore
count it a mercy that they may stay in it and a duty to stay in it. Let
those whose lot is in Canaan never quit it while they can keep it. It
would have been enough to oblige them if God had only said, "I charge
you upon your allegiance to abide still in the land;" but he rather
persuades them to it as a friend than commands it as a prince. (1.) He
expresses a very tender concern for them in their present calamitous
condition: It repenteth me of the evil that I have done unto you. Though
they had shown small sign of their repenting of their sins, yet God, as
one grieved for the misery of Israel ([Jdg
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#016).md), begins to repent of the
judgments he had brought upon them for their sins. Not that he changed
his mind, but he was very ready to change his way and to return in mercy
to them. God's time to repent himself concerning his servants is when he
sees that, as here, their strength is gone, and there is none shut up or
left, [Deu 32:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036). (2..md) He answers the
argument they had against abiding in this land. They feared the king of
Babylon ([Jer 41:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#018).md), lest he should
come and avenge the death of Gedaliah upon them, though they were no way
accessory to it, nay, had witnessed against it. The surmise was foreign
and unreasonable; but, if there had been any ground for it, enough is
here said to remove it ([Jer 42:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#011).md):
"Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, though he is a man of great might
and little mercy, and a very arbitrary prince, whose will is a law, and
therefore you are afraid he will upon this pretence, though without
colour of reason, take advantage against you; be not afraid of him, for
that fear will bring a snare: fear not him, for I am with you; and, if
God be for you to save you, who can be against you to hurt you?" Thus
has God provided to obviate and silence even the causeless fears of his
people, which discourage them in the way of their duty; there is enough
in the promises to encourage them. (3.) He assures them that if they
will still abide in this land they shall not only be safe from the king
of Babylon, but be made happy by the King of kings: "I will build you
and plant you; you shall take root again, and be the new foundation of
another state, a phoenix-kingdom, rising out of the ashes of the last."
It is added ([Jer 42:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#012).md), I will show
mercies unto you. Note, In all our comforts we may read God's mercies.
God will show them mercy in this, that not only the king of Babylon
shall not destroy them, but he shall have mercy upon them and help to
settle them. Note, Whatever kindness men do us we must attribute it to
God's kindness. He makes those whom he pities to be pitied even by those
who carried them captives, [Psa
106:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#046.md). "The king of Babylon, having
now the disposal of the country, shall cause you to return it to your
own land, shall settle you again in your own habitations and put you in
possession of the lands that formerly belonged to you." Note, God has
made that our duty which is really our privilege, and our obedience will
be its own recompence. "Abide in this land, and it shall be your own
land again and you shall continue in it. Do not quit it now that you
stand so fair for the enjoyment of it again. Be no so unwise as to
forsake your own mercies for lying vanities."

2\. That as they tender the favour of God and their own happiness they
must by no means think of going into Egypt, not thither of all places,
not to that land out of which God had delivered their fathers and which
he had so often warned them not to make alliance with nor to put
confidence in. Observe here, (1.) The sin they are supposed to be guilty
of (and to him that knew their hearts it was more than a supposition):
"You begin to say, We will not dwell in this land ([Jer
42:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#013).md); we will never think that we
can be safe in it, no, not though God himself undertake our protection.
We will not continue in it, no, not in obedience to the voice of the
Lord our God. He may say what he please, but we will do what we please.
We will go into the land of Egypt, and there will we dwell, whether God
give us leave and go along with us or no," [Jer
42:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#014.md). It is supposed that their
hearts were upon it: "If you wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt,
and are obstinately resolved that you will go and sojourn there, though
God oppose you in it both by his word and by his providence, then take
what follows." Now the reason they go upon in this resolution is that
"in Egypt we shall see no war, nor have hunger of bread,; as we have had
for a long time in this land," [Jer
42:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#014.md). Note, It is folly to quit our
place, especially to quit the holy land, because we meet with trouble in
it; but greater folly to think by changing our place to escape the
judgments of God, and that evil which pursues sinners in every way of
disobedience, and which there is no escaping but by returning to our
allegiance. (2.) The sentence passed upon them for this sin, if they
will persist in it. It is pronounced in God's name ([Jer
42:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#015).md): "Hear the word of the Lord,
you remnant of Judah, who think that because you are a remnant you must
be spared of course ([Jer 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#002).md) and
indulged in your own humour." \[1.\] Did the sword and famine frighten
them? Those very judgments shall pursue them into Egypt, shall overtake
them, and overcome them there ([Jer
42:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#016.md), [Jer
42:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#017).md): "You think, because war and
famine have long been raging in this land, that they are entailed upon
it; whereas, if you trust in God, he can make even this land a land of
peace to you; you think they are confined to it, and, if you can get
clear of this land, you shall get out of the reach of them, but God will
send them after you wherever you go." Note, the evils we think to escape
by sin we certainly and inevitably run ourselves upon. The men that go
to Egypt in contradiction to God's will, to escape the sword and famine,
shall die in Egypt by sword and famine. We may apply it to the common
calamities of human life; those that are impatient of them, and think to
avoid them by changing their place, will find that they are deceived and
that they do not at all better themselves. The grievances common to men
will meet them wherever they go. All our removes in this world are but
from one wilderness to another; still we are where we were. \[2.\] Did
the desolations of Jerusalem frighten them? Were they willing to get as
far as they could from them? They shall meet with the second part of
them too in Egypt ([Jer 42:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#018).md): As my
anger and fury have been poured out here upon Jerusalem, so they shall
be poured out upon you in Egypt. Note, Those that have by sin made God
their enemy will find him a consuming fire wherever they go. And then
you shall be an execration and an astonishment. The Hebrews were of old
an abomination to the Egyptians ([Gen
43:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#032).md), and now they shall be made
more so than ever. When God's professing people mingle with infidels,
and make their court to them, they lose their dignity and make
themselves a reproach.

3\. That God knew their hypocrisy in their enquiries of him, and that
when they asked what he would have them to do they were resolved to take
their own way; and therefore the sentence which was before pronounced
conditionally is made absolute. Having set before them good and evil,
the blessing and the curse, in the close he makes application of what he
had said. And here, (1.) He solemnly protests that he had faithfully
delivered his message, [Jer 42:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#019.md). The
conclusion of the whole matter is, "Go not down into Egypt; you disobey
the command of God if you do, and what I have said to you will be a
witness against you; for know certainly that, whether you will hear or
whether you will forbear, I have plainly admonished you; you cannot now
plead ignorance of the mind of God." (2.) He charges them with base
dissimulation in the application they made to him for divine direction
([Jer 42:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#020).md): "You dissembled in your
hearts; you professed one thing and intended another, promising what you
never meant to perform." You have used deceit against your soul (so the
margin reads it); for those that think to put a cheat upon God will
prove in the end to have put a damning cheat upon themselves. (3.) He is
already aware that they are determined to go contrary to the command of
God; probably they discovered it in their countenance and secret
mutterings already, before he had finished his discourse. However, he
spoke from him who knew their hearts: "You have not obeyed the voice of
the Lord your God; you have not a disposition to obey it." Thus Moses,
in the close of his farewell sermon, had told them ([Deu
31:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#027.md), [Deu
31:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#029).md), I know thy rebellion and thy
stiff neck, and that you will corrupt yourselves. Admire the patience of
God, that he is pleased to speak to those who, he knows, will not regard
him, and deal with those who, he knows, will deal very treacherously,
[Isa 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#008). (4..md) He therefore reads
them their doom, ratifying what he had said before: Know certainly that
you shall die by the sword, [Jer
42:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#022.md). God's threatenings may be
vilified, but cannot be nullified, by the unbelief of man. Famine and
pestilence shall pursue these sinners; for there is no place privileged
from divine arrests, nor can any malefactors go out of God's
jurisdiction. You shall die in the place whither you desire to go. Note,
We know not what is good for ourselves; and that often proves
afflictive, and sometimes fatal, which we are most fond of and have our
hearts most set upon.
