### [Philippians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#001.md)

[Philippians](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">phi 2:0</span></span>

The apostle proceeds to further exhortations to several duties, to be
like-minded, and lowly-minded, which he presses from the example of
Christ ([Phi 2:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#001).md), to be diligent
and serious in the Christian course ([Phi
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012.md), [Phi
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013).md), and to adorn their Christian
profession by several suitable graces ([Phi
2:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#014).md). He then concludes with
particular notice and commendation of two good ministers, Timothy and
Epaphroditus, whom he designed to send to them ([Phi
2:19-30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#019).md).

[Philippians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">phi 2:1</span></span>

The apostle proceeds in this chapter where he left off in the last, with
further exhortations to Christian duties. He presses them largely to
like-mindedness and lowly-mindedness, in conformity to the example of
the Lord Jesus, the great pattern of humility and love. Here we may
observe,

I. The great gospel precept passed upon us; that is, to love one
another. This is the law of Christ's kingdom, the lesson of his school,
the livery of his family. This he represents ([Phi
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#002).md) by being like-minded, having the
same love, being of one accord, of one mind. We are of a like mind when
we have the same love. Christians should be one in affection, whether
they can be one in apprehension or no. This is always in their power,
and always their duty, and is the likeliest way to bring them nearer in
judgment. Having the same love. Observe, The same love that we are
required to express to others, others are bound to express to us.
Christian love ought to be mutual love. Love, and you shall be loved.
Being of one accord, and of one mind; not crossing and thwarting, or
driving on separate interests, but unanimously agreeing in the great
things of God and keeping the unity of the Spirit in other differences.
Here observe,

1\. The pathetic pressing of the duty. He is very importunate with them,
knowing what an evidence it is of our sincerity, and what a means of the
preservation and edification of the body of Christ. The inducements to
brotherly love are these: - (1.) "If there is any consolation in Christ.
Have you experienced consolation in Christ? Evidence that experience by
loving one another." The sweetness we have found in the doctrine of
Christ should sweeten our spirits. Do we expect consolation in Christ?
If we would not be disappointed, we must love one another. If we have
not consolation in Christ, where else can we expect it? Those who have
an interest in Christ have consolation in him, strong and everlasting
consolation ([Heb 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018.md); [Th2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#016).md), and therefore ought to love one
another. (2.) "Comfort of love. If there is any comfort in Christian
love, in God's love to you, in your love to God, or in your brethren's
love to us, in consideration of all this, be you like-minded. If you
have ever found that comfort, if you would find it, if you indeed
believe that the grace of love is a comfortable grace, abound in it."
(3.) "Fellowship of the Spirit. If there is such a thing as communion
with God and Christ by the Spirit, such a thing as the communion of
saints, by virtue of their being animated and actuated by one and the
same Spirit, be you like-minded; for Christian love and like-mindedness
will preserve to us our communion with God and with one another." (4.)
"Any bowels and mercies, in God and Christ, towards you. If you expect
the benefit of God's compassions to yourselves, be you compassionate one
to another. If there is such a thing as mercy to be found among the
followers of Christ, if all who are sanctified have a disposition to
holy pity, make it appear this way." How cogent are these arguments! One
would think them enough to tame the most fierce, and mollify the
hardest, heart. (5.) Another argument he insinuates is the comfort it
would be to him: Fulfil you my joy. It is the joy of ministers to see
people like-minded and living in love. He had been instrumental in
bringing them to the grace of Christ and the love of God. "Now," says
he, "if you have found any benefit by your participation of the gospel
of Christ, if you have any comfort in it, or advantage by it, fulfil the
joy of your poor minister, who preached the gospel to you."

2\. He proposes some means to promote it. (1.) Do nothing through strife
and vain glory, [Phi 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003.md). There is no
greater enemy to Christian love than pride and passion. If we do things
in contradiction to our brethren, this is doing them through strife; if
we do them through ostentation of ourselves, this is doing them through
vain-glory: both are destructive of Christian love and kindle
unchristian heats. Christ came to slay all enmities; therefore let there
not be among Christians a spirit of opposition. Christ came to humble
us, and therefore let there not be among us a spirit of pride. (2.) We
must esteem others in lowliness of mind better than ourselves, be severe
upon our own faults and charitable in our judgments of others, be quick
in observing our own defects and infirmities, but ready to overlook and
make favourable allowances for the defects of others. We must esteem the
good which is in others above that which is in ourselves; for we best
know our own unworthiness and imperfections. (3.) We must interest
ourselves in the concerns of others, not in a way of curiosity and
censoriousness, or as busy-bodies in other men's matters, but in
Christian love and sympathy: Look not every man on his own things, but
every man also on the things of others, [Phi
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#004.md). A selfish spirit is destructive
of Christian love. We must be concerned not only for our own credit, and
ease, and safety, but for those of others also; and rejoice in the
prosperity of others as truly as in our own. We must love our neighbour
as ourselves, and make his case our own.

II\. Here is a gospel pattern proposed to our imitation, and that is the
example of our Lord Jesus Christ: Let this mind be in you which was also
in Christ Jesus, [Phi 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#005.md). Observe,
Christians must be of Christ's mind. We must bear a resemblance to his
life, if we would have the benefit of his death. If we have not the
Spirit of Christ, we are none of his, [Rom
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009.md). Now what was the mind of Christ?
He was eminently humble, and this is what we are peculiarly to learn of
him. Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, [Mat
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029.md). If we were lowly-minded, we
should be like-minded; and, if we were like Christ, we should be
lowly-minded. We must walk in the same spirit and in the same steps with
the Lord Jesus, who humbled himself to sufferings and death for us; not
only to satisfy God's justice, and pay the price of our redemption, but
to set us an example, and that we might follow his steps. Now here we
have the two natures and the two states of our Lord Jesus. It is
observable that the apostle, having occasion to mention the Lord Jesus,
and the mind which was in him, takes the hint to enlarge upon his
person, and to give a particular description of him. It is a pleasing
subject, and a gospel minister needs not think himself out of the way
when he is upon it; any fit occasion should be readily taken.

1\. Here are the two natures of Christ: his divine nature and his human
nature. (1.) Here is his divine nature: Who being in the form of God
([Phi 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006).md), partaking of the divine
nature, as the eternal and only begotten Son of God. This agrees with
[Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md), In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God: it is of the same import with being the
image of the invisible God ([Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015).md), and the brightness of his
glory, and express image of his person, [Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md). He thought it no robbery to be
equal with God; did not think himself guilty of any invasion of what did
not belong to him, or assuming another's right. He said, I and my Father
are one, [Joh 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#030.md). It is the highest
degree of robbery for any mere man or mere creature to pretend to be
equal with God, or profess himself one with the Father. This is for a
man to rob God, not in tithes and offerings, but of the rights of his
Godhead, [Mal 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#008.md). Some understand
being in the form of God - en morphē Theou huparchōn, of his appearance
in a divine majestic glory to the patriarchs, and the Jews, under the
Old Testament, which was often called the glory, and the Shechinah. The
word is used in such a sense by the Septuagint and in the New Testament.
He appeared to the two disciples, en hetera morphē - In another form,
[Mar 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#012.md). Metemorphōthē - he was
transfigured before them, [Mat 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#002.md).
And he thought it no robbery to be equal with God; he did not greedily
catch at, nor covet and affect to appear in that glory; he laid aside
the majesty of his former appearance while he was here on earth, which
is supposed to be the sense of the peculiar expression, ouk harpagmon
hēgēsato. Vid. Bishop Bull's Def. cap. 2 sect. 4 et alibi, and Whitby in
loc. (2.) His human nature: He was made in the likeness of men, and
found in fashion as a man. He was really and truly man, took part of our
flesh and blood, appeared in the nature and habit of man. And he
voluntarily assumed human nature; it was his own act, and by his own
consent. We cannot say that our participation of the human nature is so.
Herein he emptied himself, divested himself of the honours and glories
of the upper world, and of his former appearance, to clothe himself with
the rags of human nature. He was in all things like to us, [Heb
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017.md).

2\. Here are his two estates, of humiliation and exaltation. (1.) His
estate of humiliation. He not only took upon him the likeness and
fashion of a man, but the form of a servant, that is, a man of mean
estate. He was not only God's servant whom he had chosen, but he came to
minister to men, and was among them as one who serveth in a mean and
servile state. One would think that the Lord Jesus, if he would be a
man, should have been a prince, and appeared in splendour. But quite the
contrary: He took upon him the form of a servant. He was brought up
meanly, probably working with his supposed father at his trade. His
whole life was a life of humiliation, meanness, poverty, and disgrace;
he had nowhere to lay his head, lived upon alms, was a man of sorrows
and acquainted with grief, did not appear with external pomp, or any
marks of distinction from other men. This was the humiliation of his
life. But the lowest step of his humiliation was his dying the death of
the cross. He became obedient to death, even the death of the cross. He
not only suffered, but was actually and voluntarily obedient; he obeyed
the law which he brought himself under as Mediator, and by which he was
obliged to die. I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to
take it again: this commandment have I received of my Father, [Joh
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#018.md). And he was made under the law,
[Gal 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004.md). There is an emphasis laid
upon the manner of his dying, which had in it all the circumstances
possible which are humbling: Even the death of the cross, a cursed,
painful, and shameful death, - a death accursed by the law (Cursed is he
that hangeth on a tree) - full of pain, the body nailed through the
nervous parts (the hands and feet) and hanging with all its weight upon
the cross, - and the death of a malefactor and a slave, not of a
free-man, - exposed as a public spectacle. Such was the condescension of
the blessed Jesus. (2.) His exaltation: Wherefore God also hath highly
exalted him. His exaltation was the reward of his humiliation. Because
he humbled himself, God exalted him; and he highly exalted him,
huperupsōse, raised him to an exceeding height. He exalted his whole
person, the human nature as well as the divine; for he is spoken of as
being in the form of God as well as in the fashion of man. As it
respects the divine nature, it could only be the recognizing of his
rights, or the display and appearance of the glory he had with the
Father before the world was ([Joh
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005).md), not any new acquisition of
glory; and so the Father himself is said to be exalted. But the proper
exaltation was of his human nature, which alone seems to be capable of
it, though in conjunction with the divine. His exaltation here is made
to consist in honour and power. In honour; so he had a name above every
name, a title of dignity above all the creatures, men and angels. And in
power: Every knee must bow to him. The whole creation must be in
subjection to him: things in heaven, and things in earth, and things
under the earth, the inhabitants of heaven and earth, the living and the
dead. At the name of Jesus; not at the sound of the word, but the
authority of Jesus; all should pay a solemn homage. And that every
tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord - every nation and
language should publicly own the universal empire of the exalted
Redeemer, and that all power in heaven and earth is given to him, [Mat
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md). Observe the vast extent of the
kingdom of Christ; it reaches to heaven and earth, and to all the
creatures in each, to angels as well as men, and to the dead as well as
the living. - To the glory of God the Father. Observe, It is to the
glory of God the Father to confess that Jesus Christ is Lord; for it is
his will that all men should honour the Son as they honour the Father,
[Joh 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#023.md). Whatever respect is paid to
Christ redounds to the honour of the Father. He who receiveth me
receiveth him who sent me, [Mat 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#040.md).

[Philippians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">phi 2:12</span></span>

I. He exhorts them to diligence and seriousness in the Christian course:
Work out your own salvation. It is the salvation of our souls ([Pe1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#009).md), and our eternal salvation ([Heb
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#009).md), and contains deliverance from
all the evils sin had brought upon us and exposed us to, and the
possession of all good and whatsoever is necessary to our complete and
final happiness. Observe, It concerns us above all things to secure the
welfare of our souls: whatever becomes of other things, let us take care
of our best interests. It is our own salvation, the salvation of our own
souls. It is not for us to judge other people; we have enough to do to
look to ourselves; and, though we must promote the common salvation
([Jde 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#003).md) as much as we can, yet we
must upon no account neglect our own. We are required to work out our
salvation, katergazesthe. The word signifies working thoroughly at a
thing, and taking true pains. Observe, We must be diligent in the use of
all the means which conduce to our salvation. We must not only work at
our salvation, by doing something now and then about it; but we must
work out our salvation, by doing all that is to be done, and persevering
therein to the end. Salvation is the great thing we should mind, and set
our hearts upon; and we cannot attain salvation without the utmost care
and diligence. He adds, With fear and trembling, that is, with great
care and circumspection: "Trembling for fear lest you miscarry and come
short. Be careful to do every thing in religion in the best manner, and
fear lest under all your advantages you should so much as seem to come
short," [Heb 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#001.md). Fear is a great
guard and preservative from evil.

II\. He urges this from the consideration of their readiness always to
obey the gospel: "As you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only,
but now much more in my absence, [Phi
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012.md). You have been always willing to
comply with every discovery of the will of God; and that in my absence
as well as presence. You make it to appear that regard to Christ, and
care of your souls, sway more with you than any mode of showing respect
whatsoever." They were not merely awed by the apostle's presence, but
did it even much more in his absence. "And because it is God who worketh
in you, do you work out your salvation. Work, for he worketh." It should
encourage us to do our utmost, because our labour shall not be in vain.
God is ready to concur with his grace, and assist our faithful
endeavours. Observe, Though we must use our utmost endeavours in working
out our salvation, yet still we must go forth, and go on, in a
dependence upon the grace of God. His grace works in us in a way
suitable to our natures, and in concurrence with our endeavours; and the
operations of God's grace in us are so far from excusing, that they are
intended to quicken and engage our endeavours. "And work out our
salvation with fear and trembling, for he worketh in you." All our
working depends upon his working in us. "Do not trifle with God by
neglects and delays, lest you provoke him to withdraw his help, and all
your endeavours prove in vain. Work with fear, for he works of his good
pleasure." - To will and to do: he gives the whole ability. It is the
grace of God which inclines the will to that which is good: and then
enables us to perform it, and to act according to our principles. Thou
hast wrought all our works in us, [Isa
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#012.md). Of his good pleasure. As there
is no strength in us, so there is no merit in us. As we cannot act
without God's grace, so we cannot claim it, nor pretend to deserve it.
God's good will to us is the cause of his good work in us; and he is
under no engagements to his creatures, but those of his gracious
promise.

[Philippians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">phi 2:14</span></span>

The apostle exhorts them in these verses to adorn their Christian
profession by a suitable temper and behaviour, in several instances. 1.
By a cheerful obedience to the commands of God ([Phi
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#014).md): "Do all things, do your duty in
every branch of it, without murmurings. Do it, and do not find fault
with it. Mind your work, and do not quarrel with it." God's commands
were given to be obeyed, not to be disputed. This greatly adorns our
profession, and shows we serve a good Master, whose service is freedom
and whose work is its own reward. 2. By peaceableness and love one to
another. "Do all things without disputing, wrangling, and debating one
another; because the light of truth and the life of religion are often
lost in the heats and mists of disputation." 3. By a blameless
conversation towards all men ([Phi
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015).md): "That you may be blameless and
harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke; that you be not injurious to
any in word or deed, and give no just occasion of offence." We should
endeavour not only to be harmless, but to be blameless; not only not to
do hurt, but not to come under the just suspicion of it. Blameless and
sincere; so some read it. Blameless before men, sincere towards God. The
sons of God. It becomes those to be blameless and harmless who stand in
such a relation, and are favoured with such a privilege. The children of
God should differ from the sons of men. Without rebuke - Amōmēta. Momus
was a carping deity among the Greeks, mentioned by Hesiod and Lucian,
who did nothing himself, and found fault with every body and every
thing. From him all carpers at other men, and rigid censurers of their
works, were called Momi. The sense of the expression is, "Walk so
circumspectly that Momus himself may have no occasion to cavil at you,
that the severest censurer may find no fault with you." We should aim
and endeavour, not only to get to heaven, but to get thither without a
blot; and, like Demetrius, to have a good report of all men, and of the
truth, [Jo3 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#012.md). In the midst of a
crooked and perverse generation; that is, among the heathens, and those
who are without. Observe, Where there is no true religion, little is to
be expected but crookedness and perverseness; and the more crooked and
perverse others are among whom we live, and the more apt to cavil, the
more careful we should be to keep ourselves blameless and harmless.
Abraham and Lot must not strive, because the Canaanite and Perizzite
dwelt in the land, [Gen 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#007.md). Among
whom you shine as lights in the world. Christ is the light of the world,
and good Christians are lights in the world. When God raises up a good
man in any place, he sets up a light in that place. Or it may be read
imperatively: Among whom shine you as lights: compare [Mat
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#016.md), Let your light so shine before
men. Christians should endeavour not only to approve themselves to God,
but to recommend themselves to others, that they may also glorify God.
They must shine as well as be sincere. - Holding forth the word of life,
[Phi 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016.md). The gospel is called the
word of life because it reveals and proposes to us eternal life through
Jesus Christ. Life and immortality are brought to light by the gospel,
[Ti2 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010.md). It is our duty not only to
hold fast, but to hold forth the word of life; not only to hold it fast
for our own benefit, but to hold it forth for the benefit of others, to
hold it forth as the candlestick holds forth the candle, which makes it
appear to advantage all around, or as the luminaries of the heavens,
which shed their influence far and wide. This Paul tells them would be
his joy: "That I may rejoice in the day of Christ; not only rejoice in
your stedfastness, but in your usefulness." He would have them think his
pains well bestowed, and that he had not run in vain, nor laboured in
vain. Observe, (1.) The work of the ministry requires the putting forth
of the whole man: all that is within us is little enough to be employed
in it; as in running and labouring. Running denotes vehemence and
vigour, and continual pressing forward; labour denotes constancy and
close application. (2.) It is a great joy to ministers when they
perceive that they have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain; and it
will be their rejoicing in the day of Christ, when their converts will
be their crown. What is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not
even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? For you
are our glory and joy, [Th1 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019.md), [Th1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#020.md). The apostle not only ran and
laboured for them with satisfaction, but shows that he was ready to
suffer for their good ([Phi 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017).md):
Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I
joy and rejoice with you all. He could reckon himself happy if he could
promote the honour of Christ, the edification of the church, and the
welfare of the souls of men; though it were not only by hazarding, but
by laying down, his life: he could willingly be a sacrifice at their
altars, to serve the faith of God's elect. Could Paul think it worth
while to shed his blood for the service of the church, and shall we
think it much to take a little pains? Is not that worth our labour which
he thought worth his life? If I be offered, or poured out as the wine of
the drink-offerings, spendomai. [Ti2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006.md), I am now ready to be offered. He
could rejoice to seal his doctrine with his blood ([Phi
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#018).md): For the same cause also do you
joy and rejoice with me. It is the will of God that good Christians
should be much in rejoicing; and those who are happy in good ministers
have a great deal of reason to joy and rejoice with them. If the
minister loves the people, and is willing to spend and be spent for
their welfare, the people have reason to love the minister and to joy
and rejoice with him.

[Philippians 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">phi 2:19</span></span>

Paul takes particular notice of two good ministers; for though he was
himself a great apostle, and laboured more abundantly than they all, yet
he took all occasions to speak with respect of those who were far his
inferiors.

I. He speaks of Timothy, whom he intended to send to the Philippians,
that he might have an account of their state. See Paul's care of the
churches, and the comfort he had in their well-doing. He was in pain
when he had not heard of them for a good while, and therefore would send
Timothy to enquire, and bring him an account: For I have no man
like-minded, who will naturally care for your state. Timothy was a
non-such. There were, no doubt, many good ministers, who were in care
for the souls of those for whom they preached; but none comparable to
Timothy, a man of an excellent spirit and tender heart. Who will
naturally care for your state. Observe, It is best with us when our duty
becomes in a manner natural to us. Timothy was a genuine son of blessed
Paul, and walked in the same spirit and the same steps. Naturally, that
is, sincerely, and not in pretence only: with a willing heart and
upright view, so agreeably to the make of his mind. Note, 1. It is the
duty of ministers to care for the state of their people and be concerned
for their welfare: I seek not yours, but you, [Co2
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#014.md). 2. It is a rare thing to find
one who does it naturally: such a one is remarkable and distinguished
among his brethren. All seek their own, not the things which are Jesus
Christ's, [Phi 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#021.md). Did Paul say this
in haste, as David said, All men are liars? [Psa
116:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#011.md). Was there so general a
corruption among ministers so early that there was not one among them
who cared for the state of their people? We must not understand it so:
he means the generality; all, that is, either the most, or all in
comparison of Timothy. Note, Seeking our own interest to the neglect of
Jesus Christ is a very great sin, and very common among Christians and
ministers. Many prefer their own credit, ease, and safety, before truth,
holiness, and duty, the things of their own pleasure and reputation
before the things of Christ's kingdom and his honour and interest in the
world: but Timothy was none of these. - You know the proof of him, [Phi
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#022.md). Timothy was a man who had been
tried, and had made full proof of his ministry ([Ti2
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#005).md), and was faithful in all that
befell him. All the churches with whom he had acquaintance knew the
proof of him. He was a man as good as he seemed to be; and served Christ
so as to be acceptable to God, and approved of men, [Rom
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#018.md). "You not only know the name of
him, and the face of him, but the proof of him, and have experienced his
affection and fidelity in your service," that, as a son with a father,
he hath served with me in the gospel. He was Paul's assistant in many
places where he preached, and served with him in the gospel with all the
dutiful respect which a child pays to a father, and with all the love
and cheerfulness with which a child is serviceable to his father. Their
ministrations together were with great respect on the one side and great
tenderness and kindness on the other - an admirable example to elder and
younger ministers united in the same service. Paul designed to send him
shortly: Him therefore I hope to send presently, as soon as I shall see
how it will go with me, [Phi 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#023.md). He
was now a prisoner, and did not know what would be the issue; but,
according as it turned, he would dispose of Timothy. Nay, he hoped to
come himself ([Phi 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#024).md): But I trust
in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly. He hoped he should
soon be set at liberty, and be able to pay them a visit. Paul desired
his liberty, not that he might take his pleasure, but that he might do
good. - I trust in the Lord. He expresses his hope and confidence of
seeing them, with a humble dependence and submission to the divine will.
See [Act 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#021.md); [Co1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#019.md); [Jam
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#015.md); and [Heb
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#003.md).

II\. Concerning Epaphroditus, whom he calls his brother, and companion
in labour, and fellow-soldier, his Christian brother, to whom he bore a
tender affection, - his companion in the work and sufferings of the
gospel, who submitted to the same labours and hardships with himself, -
and their messenger, one who was sent by them to him, probably to
consult him about some affairs relating to their church, or to bring a
present from them for his relief for he adds, and who ministered to my
wants. He seems to be the same who is called Epaphras, [Col
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#012.md). He had an earnest desire to come
to them, and Paul was willing he should. It seems, 1. Epaphroditus had
been sick: They had heard that he had been sick, [Phi
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#026.md). And indeed he was sick, nigh
unto death, [Phi 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#027.md). Sickness is a
calamity common to men, to good men and ministers. But why did not the
apostle heal him, who was endued with a power of curing diseases, as
well as raising the dead? [Act 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#010.md).
Probably because that was intended as a sign to others, and to confirm
the truth of the gospel, and therefore needed not be exercised one
towards another. These signs shall follow those who believe, they shall
lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover, [Mar
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#017.md), [Mar
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#018.md). And perhaps they had not that
power at all times, and at their own discretion, but only when some
great end was to be served by it, and when God saw fit. It was proper to
Christ, who had the Spirit above measure. 2. The Philippians were
exceedingly sorry to hear of his sickness. They were full of heaviness,
as well as he, upon the tidings of it: for he was one, it seems, for
whom they had a particular respect and affection, and thought fit to
choose out to send to the apostle. 3. It pleased God to recover and
spare him: But God had mercy on him, [Phi
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#027.md). The apostle owns it is a great
mercy to himself, as well as to Epaphroditus and others. Though the
church was blessed at that time with extraordinary gifts, they could
even then ill spare a good minister. He was sensibly touched with the
thoughts of so great a loss: Lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow; that
is, "Lest, besides the sorrow of my own imprisonment, I should have the
sorrow of his death." Or perhaps some other good ministers had died
lately, which had been a great affliction to him: and, if this had died
now, it would have been a fresh grief to him, and sorrow added to
sorrow. 4. Epaphroditus was willing to pay a visit to the Philippians,
that he might be comforted with those who had sorrowed for him when he
was sick: "That when you see him again you may rejoice ([Phi
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#028).md), that you may yourselves see how
well he has recovered, and what reason you have for the thankfulness and
joy upon his account." He gave himself the pleasure of comforting them
by the sight of so dear a friend. 5. Paul recommends him to their esteem
and affection: "Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and
hold such in reputation: account such men valuable, who are zealous and
faithful, and let them be highly loved and regarded. Show your joy and
respect by all the expressions of hearty affection and good opinion." It
seems he had caught his illness in the work of God: It was for the work
of Christ that he was nigh to death, and to supply their lack of service
to him. The apostle does not blame him for his indiscretion in hazarding
his life, but reckons they ought to love him the more upon that account.
Observe, (1.) Those who truly love Christ, and are hearty in the
interests of his kingdom, will think it very well worth their while to
hazard their health and life to do him service, and promote the
edification of his church. (2.) They were to receive him with joy, as
newly recovered from sickness. It is an endearing consideration to have
our mercies restored to us after danger of removal, and should make them
the more valued and improved. What is given us in answer to prayer
should be received with great thankfulness and joy.
