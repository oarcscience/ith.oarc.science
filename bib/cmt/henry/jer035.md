### [Jeremiah Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 35:0</span></span>

A variety of methods is tried, and every stone turned, to awaken the
Jews to a sense of their sin and to bring them to repentance and
reformation. The scope and tendency of many of the prophet's sermons was
to frighten them out of their disobedience, by setting before them what
would be the end thereof if they persisted in it. The scope of this
sermon, in this chapter, is to shame them out of their disobedience if
they had any sense of honour left in them for a discourse of this nature
to fasten upon. I. He sets before them the obedience of the family of
the Rechabites to the commands which were left them by Jonadab their
ancestor, and how they persevered in that obedience and would not be
tempted from it ([Jer 35:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#001).md). II.
With this he aggravates the disobedience of the Jews to God and their
contempt of his precepts ([Jer
35:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#012).md). III. He foretels the
judgments of God upon the Jews for their impious disobedience to God
([Jer 35:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#016.md), [Jer
35:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#017).md). IV. He assures the Rechabites
of the blessing of God upon them for their pious obedience to their
father ([Jer 35:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#018.md), [Jer
35:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#019).md).

[Jeremiah 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 35:1</span></span>

This chapter is of an earlier date than many of those before; for what
is contained in it was said and done in the days of Jehoiakim ([Jer
35:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#001).md); but then it must be in the
latter part of his reign, for it was after the king of Babylon with his
army came up into the land ([Jer
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#011).md), which seems to refer to the
invasion mentioned [Kg2 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002.md), which
was upon occasion of Jehoiakim's rebelling against Nebuchadnezzar. After
the judgments of God had broken in upon this rebellious people he
continued to deal with them by his prophets to turn them from sin, that
his wrath might turn away from the. For this purpose Jeremiah sets
before them the example of the Rechabites, a family that kept distinct
by themselves and were no more numbered with the families of Israel than
they with the nations. They were originally Kenites, as appears [Ch1
2:55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#055.md), These are the Kenites that came
out of Hemath, the father of the house of Rechab. The Kenites, at least
those of them that gained a settlement in the land of Israel, were of
the posterity of Hobab, Moses's father-in-law, [Jdg
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016.md). We find them separated from the
Amalekites, [Sa1 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006.md). See [Jdg
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#017.md). One family of these Kenites had
their denomination from Rechab. His son, or a lineal descendant from
him, was Jonadab, a man famous in his time for wisdom and piety. he
flourished in the days of Jehu, king of Israel, nearly 300 years before
this; for there we find him courted by that rising prince, when he
affected to appear zealous for God ([Kg2
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#015.md), [Kg2
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#016).md), which he thought nothing more
likely to confirm people in the opinion of than to have so good a man as
Jonadab ride in the chariot with him. Now here we are told,

I. What the rules of living were which Jonadab, probably by his last
will and testament, in writing, and duly executed, charged his children,
and his posterity after him throughout all generations, religiously to
observe; and we have reason to think that they were such as he himself
had all his days observed.

1\. They were comprised in two remarkable precepts: - (1.) He forbade
them to drink wine, according to the law of the Nazarites. Wine is
indeed given to make glad the heart of man and we are allowed the sober
and moderate use of it; but we are so apt to abuse it and get hurt by
it, and a good man, who has his heart made continually glad with the
light of God's countenance, has so little need of it for that purpose
([Psa 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006.md), [Psa
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#007).md), that it is a commendable piece
of self-denial either not to use it at all or very sparingly and
medicinally, as Timothy used it, [Ti1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#023). (2..md) He appointed them to dwell
in tents, and not to build houses, nor purchase lands, nor rent or
occupy either, [Jer 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#007.md). This was an
instance of strictness and mortification beyond what the Nazarenes were
obliged to. Tents were mean dwellings, so that this would teach them to
be humble; they were cold dwellings, so that this would teach them to be
hardy and not to indulge the body; they were movable dwellings, so that
this would teach them not to think of settling or taking root any where
in this world. They must dwell in tents all their days. They must from
the beginning thus accustom themselves to endure hardness, and then it
would be no difficulty to them, no, not under the decays of old age.
Now,

2\. Why did Jonadab prescribe these rules of living to his posterity? It
was not merely to show his authority, and to exercise a dominion over
them, by imposing upon them what he thought fit; but it was to show his
wisdom, and the real concern he had for their welfare, by recommending
to them what he knew would be beneficial to them, yet not tying them by
any oath or vow, or under any penalty, to observe these rules, but only
advising them to conform to this discipline as far as they found it for
edification, yet to be dispensed with in any case of necessity, as here,
[Jer 35:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#011.md). He prescribed these rules
to them, (1.) That they might preserve the ancient character of their
family, which, however looked upon by some with contempt, he thought its
real reputation. His ancestors had addicted themselves to a pastoral
life ([Exo 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#016).md), and he would have
his posterity keep to it, and not degenerate from it, as Israel had
done, who originally were shepherds and dwelt in tents, [Gen
46:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#034.md). Note, We ought not to be
ashamed of the honest employments of our ancestors, though they were but
mean. (2.) That they might comport with their lot and bring their mind
to their condition. Moses had put them in hopes that they should be
naturalized ([Num 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#032).md); but, it
seems they were not; they were still strangers in the land ([Jer
35:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#007).md), had no inheritance in it, and
therefore must live by their employments, which was a good reason why
they should accustom themselves to hard fare and hard lodging; for
strangers, such as they were, must not expect to live as the landed men,
so plentifully and delicately. Note, It is our wisdom and duty to
accommodate ourselves to our place and rank, and not aim to live above
it. What has been the lot of our fathers why may we not be content that
it should be our lot, and live according to it? Mind not high things.
(3.) That they might not be envied and disturbed by their neighbours
among whom they lived. If they that were strangers should live great,
raise estates, and fare sumptuously, the natives would grudge them their
abundance, and have a jealous eye upon them, as the Philistines had upon
Isaac ([Gen 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#014).md), and would seek
occasions to quarrel with them and do them a mischief; therefore he
thought it would be their prudence to keep low, for that would be the
way to continue long-to live meanly, that they might live many days in
the land where they were strangers. Note, Humility and contentment in
obscurity are often the best policy and men's surest protection. (4.)
That they might be armed against temptations to luxury and sensuality,
the prevailing sin of the age and place they lived in. Jonadab saw a
general corruption of manners; the drunkards of Ephraim abounded, and he
was afraid lest his children should be debauched and ruined by them; and
therefore he obliged them to live by themselves, retired in the country;
and, that they might not run into any unlawful pleasures, to deny
themselves the use even of lawful delights. They must be very sober, and
temperate, and abstemious, which would contribute to the health both of
mind and body, and to their living many days, and easy ones, and such as
they might reflect upon with comfort in the land where they were
strangers. Note, The consideration of this, that we are strangers and
pilgrims, should oblige us to abstain from all fleshly lusts, to live
above the things of sense, and look upon them with a generous and
gracious contempt. (5.) That they might be prepared for times of trouble
and calamity. Jonadab might, without a spirit of prophecy, foresee the
destruction of a people so wretchedly degenerated, and he would have his
family provide, that, if they could not in the peace thereof, yet even
in the midst of the troubles thereof, they might have peace. Let them
therefore have little to lose, and then losing times would be the less
dreadful to them: let them sit loose to what they had, and then they
might with less pain be stripped of it. Note, Those are in the best
frame to meet sufferings who are mortified to the world and life a life
of self-denial. (6.) That in general they might learn to live by rule
and under discipline. It is good for us all to do so, and to teach our
children to do so. Those that have lived long, as Jonadab probably had
done when he left this charge to his posterity, can speak by experience
of the vanity of the world and the dangerous snares that are in the
abundance of its wealth and pleasures, and therefore ought to be
regarded when they warn those that come after them to stand upon their
guard.

II\. How strictly his posterity observed these rules, [Jer
35:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#008.md). They had in their respective
generations all of them obeyed the voice of Jonadab their father, had
done according to all that he commanded them. They drank no wine, though
they dwelt in a country where was plenty of it; their wives and children
drank no wine, for those that are temperate themselves should take care
that all under their charge should be so too. They built no houses,
tilled no ground, but lived upon the products of their cattle. This they
did partly in obedience to their ancestor, and out of a veneration they
had for his name and authority, and partly from the experience they
themselves had of the benefit of living such a mortified life. See the
force of tradition, and the influence that antiquity, example, and great
names, have upon men, and how that which seems very difficult will by
long usage and custom become easy and in a manner natural. Now, 1. As to
one of the particulars he had given them in charge, we are here told how
in a case of necessity they dispensed with the violation of it ([Jer
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#011).md): When the king of Babylon came
into the land with his army, though they had hitherto dwelt in tents,
they now quitted their tents, and came and dwelt in Jerusalem, and in
such houses as they could furnish themselves with there. Note, The rules
of a strict discipline must not be made too strict, but so as to admit
of a dispensation when the necessity of a case calls for it, which
therefore, in making vows of that nature, it is wisdom to provide
expressly for, that the way may be made the more clear, and we may not
afterwards be forced to say, It was an error, [Ecc
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#006.md). Commands of that nature are to be
understood with such limitations. These Rechabites would have tempted
God, and not trusted him, if they had not used proper means for their
own safety in a time of common calamity, notwithstanding the law and
custom of their family. 2. As to the other particular, we are here told
how, notwithstanding the greatest urgency, they religiously adhered to
it. Jeremiah took them into the temple ([Jer
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#002).md), into a prophet's chamber,
there, rather than into the chamber of the princes, that joined to it,
because he had a message from God, which would look more like itself
when it was delivered in the chambers of a man of God. There he not only
asked the Rechabites whether they would drink any wine, but he set pots
full of wine before them, and cups to drink out of, made the temptation
as strong as possible, and said, "Drink you wine, you shall have it on
free cost. You have broken one of the rules of your order, in coming to
live at Jerusalem; why may you not break this too, and when you are in
the city do as they there do?" But they peremptorily refused. They all
agreed in the refusal. "No, we will drink no wine; for with us it is
against the law." The prophet knew very well they would deny it, and,
when they did, urged it no further, for he saw they were stedfastly
resolved. Note, Those temptations are of no force with men of confirmed
sobriety which yet daily overcome such as, notwithstanding their
convictions, are of no resolution in the paths of virtue.

[Jeremiah 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 35:12</span></span>

The trial of the Rechabites' constancy was intended but for a sign; now
here we have the application of it.

I. The Rechabites' observance of their father's charge to them is made
use of as an aggravation of the disobedience of the Jews to God. Let
them see it and be ashamed. The prophet asks them, in God's name, "Will
you not at length receive instruction? [Jer
35:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#013.md). Will nothing affect you? Will
nothing fasten upon you? Will nothing prevail to discover sin and duty
to you? You see how obedient the Rechabites are to their father's
commandment ([Jer 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#014).md); but you have
not inclined your ear to me" ([Jer
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#015).md), though one might much more
reasonably expect that the people of God should have obeyed him than
that the sons of Jonadab should have obeyed him; and the aggravation is
very high, for, 1. The Rechabites were obedient to one who was but a man
like themselves, who had but the wisdom and power of a man, and was only
the father of their flesh; but the Jews were disobedient to an infinite
and eternal God, who had an absolute authority over them, as the Father
of their spirits. 2. Jonadab was long since dead, and was ignorant of
them, and could neither take cognizance of their disobedience to his
orders nor give correction for it; but God lives for ever, to see how
his laws are observed, and is in a readiness to revenge all
disobedience. 3. The Rechabites were never put in mind of their
obligations to their father; but God often sent his prophets to his
people, to put them in mind of their duty to him, and yet they would not
do it. This is insisted on here as a great aggravation of their
disobedience: "I have myself spoken to you, rising early and speaking by
the written word and the dictates and admonitions of conscience ([Jer
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#014).md); nay, I have sent unto you all
my servants the prophets, men like yourselves, whose terrors shall not
make you afraid, rising up early and sending them ([Jer
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#015).md), and yet all in vain." 4.
Jonadab never did that for his seed which God had done for his people.
He left them a charge, but left them no estate to bear the charge; but
God had given his people a good land, and promised them that, if they
would be obedient, they should still dwell in it, so that they were
bound both in gratitude and interest to be obedient, and yet they would
not hear, they would not hearken. 5. God did not tie up his people to so
much hardship, and to such instances of mortification, as Jonadab
obliged his seed to; and yet Jonadab's orders were obeyed and God's were
not.

II\. Judgments are threatened, as often before, against Judah and
Jerusalem, for their disobedience thus aggravated. The Rechabites shall
rise up in judgment against them, and shall condemn them; for they very
punctually performed the commandment of their father, and continued and
persevered in their obedience to it ([Jer
35:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#016).md); but this people, this
rebellious and gainsaying people, have not hearkened unto me; and
therefore ([Jer 35:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#017).md), because they
have not obeyed the precepts of the word, God will perform the
threatenings of it: "I will bring upon them, by the Chaldean army, all
the evil pronounced against them both in the law and in the prophets,
for I have spoken to them, I have called to them - spoken in a still
small voice to those that were near and called aloud to those that were
at a distance, tried all ways and means to convince and reduce them -
spoken by my word, called by my providence, both to the same purport,
and yet all to no purpose; they have not heard nor answered."

III\. Mercy is here promised to the family of the Rechabites for their
steady and unanimous adherence to the laws of their house. Though it was
only for the shaming of Israel that their constancy was tried, yet,
being unshaken, it was found unto praise, and honour, and glory; and God
takes occasion from it to tell them that he had favours in reserve for
them ([Jer 35:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#018.md), [Jer
35:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#019).md) and that they should have the
comfort of them. 1. That the family shall continue as long as any of the
families of Israel, among whom they were strangers and sojourners. it
shall never want a man to inherit what they had, though they had no
inheritance to leave. Note, Sometimes those that have the smallest
estates have the most numerous progeny; but he that sends mouths will be
sure to send meat. 2. That religion shall continue in the family: "He
shall not want a man to stand before me, to serve me." Though they are
neither priests nor levites, nor appear to have had any post in the
temple service, yet in a constant course of regular devotion, they stand
before God, to minister to him. Note, (1.) The greatest blessing that
can be entailed upon a family is to have the worship of God kept up in
it from generation to generation. (2.) Temperance, self-denial, and
mortification to the world, do very much befriend the exercises of
piety, and help to transmit the observance of them to posterity. The
more dead we are to the delights of sense the better we are disposed for
the service of God; but nothing is more fatal to the entail of religion
in a family than pride and luxury.
