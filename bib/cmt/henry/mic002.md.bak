### [Micah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md)

[Micah](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mic 2:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have, I. The sins with which the people of Israel are
charged - covetousness and oppression, fraudulent and violent practices
([Mic 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md), [Mic
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002).md), dealing barbarously, even with
women and children, and other harmless people ([Mic
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#008.md), [Mic
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#009).md). Opposition of God's prophets and
silencing them ([Mic 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006.md), [Mic
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007).md), and delighting in false prophets
([Mic 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011).md). II. The judgments with
which they are threatened for those sins, that they should be humbled,
and impoverished ([Mic 2:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#003).md), and
banished ([Mic 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010).md). III. Gracious
promises of comfort, reserved for the good people among them, in the
Messiah ([Mic 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012.md), [Mic
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013).md). And this is the sum and scope
of most of the chapters of this and other prophecies.

[Micah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 2:1</span></span>

Here is, I. The injustice of man contriving the evil of sin, [Mic
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md), [Mic
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002.md). God was coming forth against this
people to destroy them, and here he shows what was the ground of his
controversy with them; it is that which is often mentioned as a sin that
hastens the ruin of nations and families as much as any, the sin of
oppression. Let us see the steps of it. 1. They eagerly desire that
which is not their own - that is the root of bitterness, the root of all
evil, [Mic 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002.md). They covet fields and
houses, as Ahab did Naboth's vineyard. "Oh that such a one's field and
house were mine! It lies convenient for me, and I would manage it better
than he does; it is fitter for me than for him." 2. They set their wits
on work to invent ways of accomplishing their desire ([Mic
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004).md); they devise iniquity with a
great deal of cursed art and policy; they plot how to do it effectually,
and yet so as not to expose themselves, or bring themselves into danger,
or under reproach, by it. This is called working evil! they are working
it in their heads, in their families, and are as intent upon it, and
with as much pleasure, as if they were doing it, and are as confident of
their success (so wisely do they think they have laid the scheme) as if
it were assuredly done. Note, It is bad to do mischief upon a sudden
thought, but much worse to devise it, to do it with design and
deliberation; when the craft and subtlety of the old serpent appear with
his poison and venom, it is wickedness in perfection. They devised it
upon their beds, when they should have been asleep; care to compass a
mischievous design held their eyes waking. Upon their beds, where they
should have been remembering God, and meditating upon him, where they
should have been communing with their own hearts and examining them,
they were devising iniquity. It is of great consequence to improve and
employ the hours of our retirement and solitude in a proper manner. 3.
They employ their power in executing what they have designed and
contrived; they practise the iniquity they have devised, because it is
in the power of their hand; they find that they can compass it by the
help of their wealth, and the authority and interest they have, and that
none dare control them, or call them to an account for it; and this,
they think, will justify them and bear them out in it. Note, It is the
mistake of many to think that as they can do they may do; whereas no
power is given for destruction, but all for edification. 4. They are
industrious and very expeditious in accomplishing the iniquity they have
devised; when they have settled the matter in their thoughts, in their
beds, they lose no time, but as soon as the morning is light they
practice it; they are up early in the prosecution of their designs, and
what ill their hand finds to do they do it with all their might, which
shames our slothfulness and dilatoriness in doing good, and should shame
us out of them. In the service of God, and our generation, let it never
be said that we left that to be done tomorrow which we could do today.
5. They stick at nothing to compass their designs; what they covet they
take away, if they can, and, (1.) They care not what wrong they do,
though it be ever so gross and open; they take away men's fields by
violence, not only by fraud, and underhand practices and colour of law,
but by force and with a high hand. (2.) They care not to whom they do
wrong nor how far the iniquity extends which they devise: They oppress a
man and his house; they rob and ruin those that have numerous families
to maintain, and are not concerned though they send them and their wives
and children a begging. They oppress a man and his heritage; they take
away from men that which they have an unquestionable title to, having
received it from their ancestors, and which they have but in trust, to
transmit it to their posterity; but those oppressors care not how many
they impoverish, so they may but enrich themselves. Note, If
covetousness reigns in the heart, commonly all compassion is banished
from it; and if any man love this world, as the love of the Father, so
the love of his neighbour is not in him.

II\. The justice of God contriving the evil of punishment for this sin
([Mic 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#003).md): Therefore thus saith the
Lord, the righteous God, that judges between man and man, and is an
avenger on those that do wrong, Behold, against this family do I devise
an evil, that is, against the whole kingdom, the house of Israel, and
particularly those families in it that were cruel and oppressive. They
unjustly devise evil against their brethren, and God will justly devise
evil against them. Infinite Wisdom will so contrive the punishment of
their sin that it shall be very sure, and such as cannot be avoided,
very severe, and such as they cannot bear, very signal and remarkable,
and such as shall be universally observed to answer to the sin. The more
there appears of a wicked wit in the sin the more there shall appear of
a holy wisdom and fitness in the punishment; for the Lord will be known
by the judgments he executes; he will be owned by them. 1. He finds them
very secure, and confident that they shall in some way or other escape
the judgment, or, though they fall under it, shall soon throw it off and
get clear of it, and therefore he tells them, It is an evil from which
they shall not remove their neck. They were children of Belial, that
would not endure the easy yoke of God's righteous commands, but broke
those bonds asunder, and cast away those cords from them; and therefore
God will lay upon them the heavy yoke of his righteous judgments, and
they shall not be able to withdraw their necks from that; those that
will not be overruled shall be overcome. 2. He finds them very proud and
stately, and therefore he tells them that they shall not go haughtily,
with stretched-forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they
go ([Isa 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016).md); for this time is evil,
and the events of it are very humbling and mortifying, and such as will
bring down the stoutest spirit. 3. He finds them very merry and jovial,
and therefore tells them their note shall be changed, their laughter
shall be turned into mourning and their joy into heaviness ([Mic
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004).md): In that day, when God comes to
punish you for your oppression, shall one take up a parable against you,
and lament with a doleful lamentation, with a lamentation of
lamentations (so the word is), a most lamentable lamentation, as a song
of songs is a most pleasing song. Their enemies shall insult over them,
and make a jest of their griefs, for they shall take up a parable
against them. Their friends shall mourn over them, and lay to heart
their calamities, and this shall be the general cry, "We are utterly
spoiled; we are all undone." Note, Those that were most haughty and
secure in their prosperity are commonly most dejected and most ready to
despair in their adversity. 4. He finds them very rich in houses and
lands, which they have gained by oppression, and therefore tells them
that they shall be stripped of all. (1.) They shall, in their despair,
give it all up; they shall say, We are utterly spoiled; he has changed
the portion of my people, so that it is now no longer theirs, but it is
in the possession and occupation of their enemies: How has he removed it
from me! How suddenly, how powerfully! What is unjustly got by us will
not long continue with us; the righteous God will remove it. Turning
away from us in wrath, he has divided our fields, and given them into
the hands of strangers. Woe to those from whom God turns away. The
margin reads it, "Instead of restoring, he has divided our fields;
instead of putting us again in the possession of our estates, he has
confirmed those in the possession of them that have taken them from us."
Note, It is just with God that those who have dealt fraudulently and
violently with others should themselves be dealt fraudulently and
violently with. (2.) God shall ratify what they say in their despair
([Mic 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#005).md); so it shall be: Thou shalt
have none to cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the Lord, none to
divide inheritances, because there shall be no inheritances to divide,
no courts to try titles to lands, or determine controversies about them,
or cast lots upon them, as in Joshua's time, for all shall be in the
enemies' hand. This land, which should be taken from them, they had not
only an unquestionable title to, but a very comfortable enjoyment of,
for it was in the congregation of the Lord, or rather the congregation
of the Lord was in it; it was God's land; it was a holy land, and
therefore it was the more grievous to them to be turned out of it. Note,
Those are to be considered the sorest calamities which cut us off from
the congregation of the Lord, or cut us short in the enjoyment of the
privileges of it.

[Micah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mic 2:6</span></span>

Here are two sins charged upon the people of Israel, and judgments
denounced against them for each, such judgments as exactly answer the
sin - persecuting God's prophets and oppressing God's poor.

I. Persecuting God's prophets, suppressing and silencing them, is a sin
that provokes God as much as anything, for it not only spits in the face
of his authority over us, but spurns at the bowels of his mercy to us;
for his sending prophets to us is a sure and valuable token of his
goodwill. Now observe here,

1\. What the obstruction and opposition were which this people gave to
God's prophets: They said to those that prophesy, Prophesy ye not, as
[Isa 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#010.md). They said to the seers,
"See not; do not trouble us with accounts of what you have seen, nor
bring us any such frightful messages." They must either not prophesy at
all or prophesy only what is pleasing. The word for prophesying here
signifies dropping, for the words of the prophets dropped from heaven as
the dew. Note, Those that hate to be reformed hate to be reproved, and
do all they can to silence faithful ministers. Amos was forbidden to
prophesy, [Amo 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#010.md), etc. Therefore
persecutors stop their breath, because they have no other way to stop
their mouths; for, if they live, they will preach and torment those that
dwell on the earth, as the two witnesses did, [Rev
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#010.md). Some read it, Prophesy not; let
these prophesy. Let not those prophesy that tell us of our faults, and
threaten us, but let those prophesy that will flatter us in our sins,
and cry peace to us. They will not say that they will have no ministers
at all, but they will have such as will say just what they would have
them and go their way. This they are charged with ([Mic
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011).md), that when they silenced and
frowned upon the true prophets they countenanced and encouraged
pretenders, and set them up, and made an interest for them, to confront
God's faithful prophets: If a man walk in the spirit of falsehood,
pretend to have the Spirit of God, while really it is a spirit of error,
a spirit of delusion, and he himself knows that he has no commission, no
instruction, from God, yet, if he says, I will prophesy unto thee of
wine and strong drink, if he will but assure them that they shall have
wine and strong drink enough, that they need not fear the judgments of
war and famine which the other prophets threatened them with, that they
shall always have plenty of the delights of sense and never know the
want of them, and if he will but tell them that it is lawful for them to
drink as much as they please of their wine and strong drink, and they
need not scruple being drunk, that they shall have peace though they go
on and add drunkenness to thirst, such a prophet as this is a man after
their own heart, who will tell them that there is neither sin nor danger
in the wicked course of life they lead: He shall even be the prophet of
this people; such a man they would have to be their prophet, that will
not only associate with them in their rioting and revellings, but will
pretend to consecrate their sensualities by his prophecies and so harden
them in their security and sensuality. Note, It is not strange if people
that are vicious and debauched covet to have ministers that are
altogether such as themselves, for they are willing to believe God is so
too, [Psa 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021.md). But how are sacred
things profaned when they are prostituted to such base purposes, when
prophecy itself shall be pressed into the services of a lewd and profane
crew! But thus that servant who said, My Lord delays his coming, by the
spirit of falsehood, smote his fellow servants and ate and drank with
the drunken.

2\. How they are here expostulated with upon this matter ([Mic
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007).md): "O thou that art named the house
of Jacob, does it become thee to say and do thus? Wilt thou silence
those that prophesy, and forbid them to speak in God's name?" Note, It
is an honour and privilege to be named of the house of Jacob. Thou art
called a Jew, [Rom 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017.md). But, when
those who are called by that worthy name degenerate, they commonly prove
the worst of men themselves and the worst enemies to God's prophets. The
Jews who were named of the house of Jacob were the most violent
persecutors of the first preachers of the gospel. Upon this the prophet
here argues with these oppressors of the word of God, and shows them,
(1.) What an affront they hereby put upon God, the God of the holy
prophets: "Is the Lord's Spirit straitened? In silencing the Lord's
prophets you do what you can to silence his Spirit too; but do you think
you can do it? Can you make the Spirit of God your prisoner and your
servant? Will you prescribe to him what he shall say, and forbid him to
say what is displeasing to you? If you silence the prophets, yet cannot
the Spirit of the Lord find out other ways to reach your consciences?
Can your unbelief frustrate the divine counsels?" (2.) What a scandal it
was to their profession as Jews: "You are named the house of Jacob, and
this is your honour; but are these his doings? Are these the doings of
your father Jacob? Do you herein tread in his steps? No; if you were
indeed his children you would do his works; but now you seek to kill and
silence a man that tells you the truth, in God's name; this did not
Abraham ([Joh 8:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#039.md), [Joh
8:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#040).md); this did not Jacob." Or, "Are
these God's doings? Are these the doings that will please him? Are these
the doings of his people? No, you know they are not, however some may be
so strangely blinded and bigoted as to kill God's ministers and think
that therein they do him service," [Joh
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#002). (3..md) Let them consider how
unreasonable and absurd the thing was in itself: Do not my words do good
to those that walk uprightly? Yes; certainly they do; it is an appeal to
the experiences of the generation of the upright: "Call now if there be
any of them that will answer you, and to which of the saints will you
turn? Turn to which you will, and you will find they all agree in this,
that the word of God does good to those that walk uprightly; and will
you then oppose that which does good, so much good as good preaching
does? Herein you wrong God, who owns the words of the prophets to be his
words (they are my words) and who by them aims and designs to do good to
mankind ([Psa 119:68](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#068).md); and will you
hinder the great benefactor from doing good? Will you put the light of
the world under a bushel: You might as well say to the sun, Shine not,
as say to the seers, See not. Herein you wrong the souls of men, and
deprive them of the benefit designed them by the word of God." Note,
Those are enemies not only to God, but to the world, they are enemies to
their country, that silence good ministers, and obstruct the means of
knowledge and grace; for it is certainly for the public common good of
states and kingdoms that religion should be encouraged. God's words do
good to those that walk uprightly. It is the character of good people
that they walk uprightly ([Psa 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#002).md);
and it is their comfort that the words of God are good and do good to
them; they find comfort in them. God's words are good words to good
people, and speak comfortably to them. But those that opposed the words
of God, and silenced the prophets, pleaded, in justification of
themselves, that God's words were unprofitable and unpleasant to them,
and did them no good, nor prophesied any good concerning them, but evil,
as Ahab complained of Micaiah, in answer to which the prophet here tells
them that it was their own fault; they might thank themselves. They
might find it of good use to them if they were but disposed to make a
good use of it; if they would but walk uprightly, as they should, and so
qualify themselves for comfort, the word of God would speak comfortably
to them. Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise for the same.

3\. What they are threatened with for this sin; God also will choose
their delusions, and, (1.) They shall be deprived of the benefit of a
faithful ministry. Since they say, Prophesy not, God will take them at
their word, and they shall not prophesy to them; their sin shall be
their punishment. If men will silence God's ministers, it is just with
God to silence them, as he did Ezekiel, and to say, They shall no more
be reprovers and monitors to them. Let the physician no longer attend
the patient that will not be healed, for he will not be ruled. They
shall not prophesy to them, and then they will not take shame. As it is
the work of magistrates, so it is also of ministers, to put men to shame
when they do amiss ([Jdg 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#007).md), that,
being made ashamed of their folly, they may not return again to it; but,
when God gives men up to be impudent and shameless in sin, he says to
his prophets, They are joined to idols; let them alone. (2.) They shall
be given up to the blind guidance of an unfaithful ministry. We may
understand [Mic 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011.md) as a threatening:
If a man be found walking in the spirit of falsehood, having such a
lying spirit as was in the mouth of Ahab's prophets, that will
strengthen their hands in their wicked ways, he shall be the prophet of
this people, that is, God will leave them to themselves to hearken to
such; since they will be deceived, let them be deceived; since they will
not admit the truth in the love of it, God will send them strong
delusions to believe a lie, [Th2 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#010.md),
[Th2 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011.md). They shall have prophets
that will prophesy to them for wine and strong drink (so some read it),
that will give you a cast of their office to your mind for a bottle of
wine of a flagon of ale, will soothe sinners in their sins if they will
but feed them with the gratifications of their lusts; to have such
prophets, and to be ridden by them, is as sad a judgment as any people
can be under and as bad a preface of ruin approaching as it is to a
particular person to be under the influence of a debauched conscience.

II\. Oppressing God's poor is another sin they are charged with, as
before ([Mic 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md), [Mic
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002).md), for it is a sin doubly hateful
and provoking to God. Observe,

1\. How the sin is described, [Mic
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#008.md), [Mic
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#009.md). When they contemned God's
prophets and opposed them they broke out into all other wickedness; what
bonds will hold those that have no reverence for God's word? Those who
formerly rose up against the enemies of the nation, in defence of their
country and therein behaved themselves bravely, now of late rose up as
enemies of the nation, and, instead of defending it, destroyed it, and
did it more mischief (as usually such vipers in the bowels of a state
do) than a foreign enemy could do. They made a prey of men, women, and
children, (1.) Of men, that were travelling on the way, that pass by
securely as men averse from war, that were far from any bad designs, but
went peaceably about their lawful occasions; those they set upon, as if
they had been dangerous obnoxious people, and pulled off the robe with
the garment from them, that is, they stripped them both of the upper and
the inner garment, took away their cloak, and would have their coat
also; thus barbarously did they use those that were quiet in the land,
who, being harmless, were fearless, and so the more easily make a prey
of. (2.) Of women, whose sex should have been their protection ([Mic
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#009).md): The women of my people have you
cast out from their pleasant houses. They devoured widows' houses ([Mat
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014).md), and so turned them out of the
possession of them, because they were pleasant houses, and such as they
had a mind for. It was inhuman to deal thus barbarously with women; but
that which especially aggravated it was that they were the women of
God's people, whom they knew to be under his protection. (3.) Of
children, whose age entitles them to a tender usage: From their children
have you taken away my glory for ever. It was the glory of the
Israelites' children that they were free, but they enslaved them - that
they were born in God's house, and had a right to the privileges of it,
but they sold them to strangers, sent them into idolatrous countries,
where they were deprived for ever of that glory; at least the oppressors
designed their captivity should be perpetual. Note, The righteous God
will certainly reckon for injuries done to the widows and fatherless,
who, being helpless and friendless, cannot otherwise expect to be
righted.

2\. What the sentence is that is passed upon them for it ([Mic
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010).md): "Arise ye, and depart; prepare
to quit this land, for you shall be forced out of it, as you have forced
the women and children of my people out of their possessions; it is not,
it shall not, be your rest, as it was intended that Canaan should be,
[Psa 95:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#011.md). You shall have neither
contentment nor continuance in it, because it is polluted by your
wickedness." Sin is defiling to a land, and sinners cannot expect to
rest in a land which they have polluted, but is will spew them out, as
this land spewed out the Canaanites of old when they had polluted it
with their abominations, [Lev 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#027.md),
[Lev 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#028.md). "Nay, you shall not only
be obliged to depart out of this land, but it shall destroy you even
with a sore destruction; you shall either be turned out of it or (which
is all one) you shall be ruined in it." We may apply this to our state
in this present world; it is polluted; there is a great deal of
corruption in the world, through lust, and therefore we should arise,
and depart out of it, keep at a distance from the corruption that is in
it, and keep ourselves unspotted from it. It is not our rest; it was
never intended to be so; it was designed for our passage, but not for
our portion - our inn, but not our home. Here we have no continuing
city; let us therefore arise and depart; let us sit loose to it and live
above it, and think of leaving it and seek a continuing city above.

[Micah 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mic 2:12</span></span>

After threatenings of wrath, the chapter here concludes, as is usual in
the prophets, with promises of mercy, which were in part fulfilled when
the Jews returned out of Babylon, and had their full accomplishment in
the kingdom of the Messiah. Their grievances shall be all redressed. 1.
Whereas they were dispersed, they shall be brought together again, and
shall jointly receive the tokens of God's favour to them, and shall have
communion with each other and comfort in each other ([Mic
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012).md): "I will surely assemble, O
Jacob! all of thee, all that belong to thee, all that are named of the
house of Jacob ([Mic 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007).md) that are now
expelled your country, [Mic 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010.md). I
will bring you together again, and not one of you shall be lost, not one
of you shall be missing. I will surely gather the remnant of Israel,
that remnant that is designed and reserved for salvation; they shall be
brought to incorporate in one body. I will put them together as the
sheep of Bozrah." Sheep are inoffensive and sociable creatures; they
shall be as the flock in the midst of their fold, where they are safe
under the shepherd's eye and care; and they shall make great noise (as
numerous flocks and herds do, with their bleating and lowing) by reason
of the multitude of men (for the sheep are men, as the prophet explains
this comparison, [Eze 34:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#031).md), not by
reason of their strifes and contentions, but by reason of their great
numbers. This was accomplished when Christ by his gospel gathered
together in one all the children of God that were scattered abroad, and
united both Jews and Gentiles in one fold, and under one Shepherd, when
all the complaint was that the place was too strait for them - that was
the noise, by reason of their multitude ([Isa
49:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#019.md), [Isa
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#020).md), when there were some added to
the church from all parts of the world, and all men were drawn to Christ
by the attractive power of his cross, which shall be done yet more and
more, and perfectly done, when he shall send forth his angels to gather
in his elect from the four winds. 2. Whereas God had seemed to desert
them, and cast them off, now he will own them, and head them, and help
them through all the difficulties that are in the way of their return
and deliverance ([Mic 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013).md): the
breaker has come up before them, to break down all opposition, and clear
the road for them; and under his guidance they have broken up, and have
passed through the gate, the door of escape out of their captivity, and
have gone out by it with courage and resolution, having Omnipotence for
their vanguard. Their King shall pass before them, to head them in the
way, even Jehovah (he was their king) on the head of them, as he was on
the head of the armies of Israel when they followed the pillar of cloud
and fire through the wilderness and when he appeared to Joshua as
captain of the Lord's host. Christ is the church's King; he is Jehovah;
he heads them, passes before them, brings them out of the land of their
captivity, brings them into the land of their rest. He is the breaker,
that broke through them, that rent the veil, and opened the kingdom of
heaven to all believers. The learned bishop Pearson applies it to the
resurrection of Christ, by which he obtained the power and became the
pattern of our resurrection. The breaker has gone up before us out of
the grave, and has carried away its gates, as Samson did Gaza's, bar and
all, and by that breach we go out. The learned Dr. Pocock mentions, as
the sense which some of the ancient Jews give of it, that the breaker is
Elias, and their King the Messiah, the Son of David; and he thinks we
may apply it to Christ and his forerunner John the Baptist. John was the
breaker; he broke the ice, prepared the way of the Lord by the baptism
of repentance; in him the gospel began; from his time the kingdom of
heaven suffered violence; and so the Christian church is introduced,
with Messiah the Prince before it, on the head of it, going forth
conquering and to conquer.
