### [Psalms Chapter 81](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 81:0</span></span>

This psalm was penned, as is supposed, not upon occasion of any
particular providence, but for the solemnity of a particular ordinance,
either that of the new-moon in general or that of the feast of trumpets
on the new moon of the seventh month, [Lev
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#024.md); [Num
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001.md). When David, by the Spirit,
introduced the singing of psalms into the temple-service this psalm was
intended for that day, to excite and assist the proper devotions of it.
All the psalms are profitable; but, if one psalm be more suitable than
another to the day and observances of it, we should choose that. The two
great intentions of our religious assemblies, and which we ought to have
in our eye in our attendance on them, are answered in this psalm, which
are, to give glory to God and to receive instruction from God, to
"behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple;"
accordingly by this psalm we are assisted on our solemn feast days, I.
In praising God for what he is to his people ([Psa
81:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#001).md), and has done for them ([Psa
81:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#004).md). II. In teaching and
admonishing one another concerning the obligations we lie under to God
([Psa 81:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#008).md), the danger of
revolting from him ([Psa 81:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#011.md), [Psa
81:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#012).md), and the happiness we should
have if we would but keep close to him ([Psa
81:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#013).md). This, though spoken
primarily of Israel of old, is written for our learning, and is
therefore to be sung with application.

To the chief musician upon Gittith. A psalm of Asaph.

[Psalms 81:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 81:1</span></span>

When the people of God were gathered together in the solemn day, the day
of the feast of the Lord, they must be told that they had business to
do, for we do not go to church to sleep nor to be idle; no, there is
that which the duty of every day requires, work of the day, which is to
be done in its day. And here,

I. The worshippers of God are excited to their work, and are taught, by
singing this psalm, to stir up both themselves and one another to it,
[Psa 81:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#001.md). Our errand is, to give
unto God the glory due unto his name, and in all our religious
assemblies we must mind this as our business. 1. In doing this we must
eye God as our strength, and as the God of Jacob, [Psa
81:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#001.md). He is the strength of Israel, as
a people; for he is a God in covenant with them, who will powerfully
protect, support, and deliver them, who fights their battles and makes
them do valiantly and victoriously. He is the strength of every
Israelite; by his grace we are enabled to go through all our services,
sufferings, and conflicts; and to him, as our strength, we must pray,
and we must sing praise to him as the God of all the wrestling seed of
Jacob, with whom we have a spiritual communion. 2. We must do this by
all the expressions of holy joy and triumph. It was then to be done by
musical instruments, the timbrel, harp, and psaltery; and by blowing the
trumpet, some think in remembrance of the sound of the trumpet on Mount
Sinai, which waxed louder and louder. It was then and is now to be done
by singing psalms, singing aloud, and making a joyful noise. The
pleasantness of the harp and the awfulness of the trumpet intimate to us
that God is to be worshipped with cheerfulness and joy with reverence
and godly fear. Singing aloud and making a noise intimate that we must
be warm and affectionate in praising God, that we must with a hearty
good-will show forth his praise, as those that are not ashamed to own
our dependence on him and obligations to him, and that we should join
many together in this work; the more the better; it is the more like
heaven. 3. This must be done in the time appointed. No time is amiss for
praising God (Seven times a day will I praise thee; nay, at midnight
will I rise and give thanks unto thee); but some are times appointed,
not for God to meet us (he is always ready), but for us to meet one
another, that we may join together in praising Do. The solemn feast-day
must be a day of praise; when we are receiving the gifts of God's
bounty, and rejoicing in them, then it is proper to sing his praises.

II\. They are here directed in their work. 1. They must look up to the
divine institution which it is the observation of. In all religious
worship we must have an eye to the command ([Psa
81:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#004).md): This was a statute for Israel,
for the keeping up of a face of religion among them; it was a law of the
God of Jacob, which all the seed of Jacob are bound by, and must be
subject to. Note, Praising God is not only a good thing, which we do
well to do, but it is our indispensable duty, which we are obliged to
do; it is at our peril if we neglect it; and in all religious exercises
we must have an eye to the institution as our warrant and rule: "This I
do because God has commanded me; and therefore I hope he will accept
me;" then it is done in faith. 2. They must look back upon those
operations of divine Providence which it is the memorial of. This solemn
service was ordained for a testimony ([Psa
81:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#005).md), a standing traditional
evidence, for the attesting of the matters of fact. It was a testimony
to Israel, that they might know and remember what God had done for their
fathers, and would be a testimony against them if they should be
ignorant of them and forget them. (1.) The psalmist, in the people's
name, puts himself in mind of the general work of God on Israel's
behalf, which was kept in remembrance by this and other solemnities,
[Psa 81:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#005.md). When God went out against
the land of Egypt, to lay it waste, that he might force Pharaoh to let
Israel go, then he ordained solemn feast-days to be observed by a
statute for ever in their generations, as a memorial of it, particularly
the passover, which perhaps is meant by the solemn feast-day ([Psa
81:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#003).md); that was appointed just then
when God went out through the land of Egypt to destroy the first-born,
and passed over the houses of the Israelites, [Exo
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#023.md), [Exo
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#024.md). By it that work of wonder was
to be kept in perpetual remembrance, that all ages might in it behold
the goodness and severity of God. The psalmist, speaking for his people,
takes notice of this aggravating circumstance of their slavery in Egypt
that there they heard a language that they understood not; there they
were strangers in a strange land. The Egyptians and the Hebrews
understood not one another's language; for Joseph spoke to his brethren
by an interpreter ([Gen 42:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#023).md), and
the Egyptians are said to be to the house of Jacob a people of a strange
language, [Psa 114:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001.md). To make a
deliverance appear the more gracious, the more glorious, it is good to
observe every thing that makes the trouble we are delivered from appear
the more grievous. (2.) The psalmist, in God's name, puts the people in
mind of some of the particulars of their deliverance. Here he changes
the person, [Psa 81:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#006.md). God speaks by
him, saying, I removed the shoulder from the burden. Let him remember
this on the feast-day, \[1.\] That God had brought them out of the house
of bondage, had removed their shoulder from the burden of oppression
under which they were ready to sink, had delivered their hands from the
pots, or panniers, or baskets, in which they carried clay or bricks.
Deliverance out of slavery is a very sensible mercy and one which ought
to be had in everlasting remembrance. But this was not all. \[2.\] God
had delivered them at the Red Sea; then they called in trouble, and he
rescued them and disappointed the designs of their enemies against them,
[Exo 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#010.md). Then he answered them with
a real answer, out of the secret place of thunder; that is, out of the
pillar of fire, through which God looked upon the host of the Egyptians
and troubled it, [Exo 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#024.md), [Exo
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#025.md). Or it may be meant of the
giving of the law at Mount Sinai, which was the secret place, for it was
death to gaze ([Exo 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#021).md), and it was
in thunder that God then spoke. Even the terrors of Sinai were favours
to Israel, [Deu 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#033.md). \[3.\] God had
borne their manners in the wilderness: "I proved thee at the waters of
Meribah; thou didst there show thy temper, what an unbelieving murmuring
people thou wast, and yet I continued my favour to thee." Selah - Mark
that; compare God's goodness and man's badness, and they will serve as
foils to each other. Now if they, on their solemn feast-days, were thus
to call to mind their redemption out of Egypt, much more ought we, on
the Christian sabbath, to call to mind a more glorious redemption
wrought out for us by Jesus Christ from worse than Egyptian bondage, and
the many gracious answers he has given to us, notwithstanding our
manifold provocations.

[Psalms 81:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 81:8</span></span>

God, by the psalmist, here speaks to Israel, and in them to us, on whom
the ends of the world are come.

I. He demands their diligent and serious attention to what he was about
to say ([Psa 81:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#008).md): "Hear, O my
people! and who should hear me if my people will not? I have heard and
answered thee; now wilt thou hear me? Hear what is said with the
greatest solemnity and the most unquestionable certainty, for it is what
I will testify unto thee. Do not only give me the hearing, but hearken
unto me, that is, be advised by me, be ruled by me." Nothing could be
more reasonably nor more justly expected, and yet God puts an if upon
it: "If thou wilt hearken unto me. It is thy interest to do so, and yet
it is questionable whether thou wilt or no; for thy neck is an iron
sinew."

II\. He puts them in mind of their obligation to him as the Lord their
God and Redeemer ([Psa 81:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#010).md): I am
the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt; this is the
preface to the ten commandments, and a powerful reason for the keeping
of them, showing that we are bound to it in duty, interest, and
gratitude, all which bonds we break asunder if we be disobedient.

III\. He gives them an abstract both of the precepts and of the promises
which he gave them, as the Lord and their God, upon their coming out of
Egypt. 1. The great command was that they should have no other gods
before him ([Psa 81:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#009).md): There shall no
strange god be in thee, none besides thy own God. Other gods might well
be called strange gods, for it was very strange that ever any people who
had the true and living God for their God should hanker after any other.
God is jealous in this matter, for he will not suffer his glory to be
given to another; and therefore in this matter they must be circumspect,
[Exo 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#013.md). 2. The great promise was
that God himself, as a God all-sufficient, would be nigh unto them in
all that which they called upon him for ([Deu
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#007).md), that, if they would adhere to
him as their powerful protector and ruler, they should always find him
their bountiful benefactor: "Open thy mouth wide and I will fill it, as
the young ravens that cry open their mouths wide and the old ones fill
them." See here, (1.) What is our duty - to raise our expectations from
God and enlarge our desires towards him. We cannot look for too little
from the creature nor too much from the Creator. We are not straitened
in him; why therefore should we be straitened in our own bosoms? (2.)
What is God's promise. I will fill thy mouth with good things, [Psa
103:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#005.md). There is enough in God to fill
our treasures ([Pro 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#021).md), to
replenish every hungry soul ([Jer
31:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#025).md), to supply all our wants, to
answer all our desires, and to make us completely happy. The pleasures
of sense will surfeit and never satisfy ([Isa
55:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#002).md); divine pleasures will satisfy
and never surfeit. And we may have enough from God if we pray for it in
faith. Ask, and it shall be given you. He gives liberally, and upbraids
not. God assured his people Israel that it would be their own fault if
he did not do as great and kind things for them as he had done for their
fathers. Nothing should be thought too good, too much, to give them, if
they would but keep close to God. He would moreover have given them such
and such things, [Sa2 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#008.md).

IV\. He charges them with a high contempt of his authority as their
lawgiver and his grace and favour as their benefactor, [Psa
81:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#011.md). He had done much for them, and
designed to do more; but all in vain: "My people would not hearken to my
voice, but turned a deaf ear to all I said." Two things he complains of:
- 1. Their disobedience to his commands. They did hear his voice, so as
never any people did; but they would not hearken to it, they would not
be ruled by it, neither by the law nor by the reason of it. 2. Their
dislike of his covenant-relation to them: They would none of me. They
acquiesced not in my word (so the Chaldee); God was willing to be to
them a God, but they were not willing to be to him a people; they did
not like his terms. "I would have gathered them, but they would not."
They had none of him; and why had they not? It was not because they
might not; they were fairly invited into covenant with God. It was not
because they could not; for the word was nigh them, even in their mouth
and in their heart. But it was purely because they would not. God calls
them hi people, for they were bought by him, bound to him, his by a
thousand ties, and yet even they had not hearkened, had not obeyed.
"Israel, the seed of Jacob my friend, set me at nought, and would have
none of me." Note, All the wickedness of the wicked world is owing to
the wilfulness of the wicked will. The reason why people are not
religious is because they will not be so.

V. He justifies himself with this in the spiritual judgments he had
brought upon them ([Psa 81:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#012).md): So I
gave them up unto their own hearts' lusts, which would be more dangerous
enemies and more mischievous oppressors to them than any of the
neighbouring nations ever were. God withdrew his Spirit from them, took
off the bridle of restraining grace, left them to themselves, and
justly; they will do as they will, and therefore let them do as they
will. Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone. It is a righteous thing
with God to give those up to their own hearts' lusts that indulge them,
and give up themselves to be led by them; for why should his Spirit
always strive? His grace is his own, and he is debtor to no man, and
yet, as he never gave his grace to any that could say they deserved it,
so he never took it away from any but such as had first forfeited it:
They would none of me, so I gave them up; let them take their course.
And see what follows: They walked in their own counsels, in the way of
their heart and in the sight of their eye, both in their worships and in
their conversations. "I left them to do as they would, and then they did
all that was ill;" they walked in their own counsels, and not according
to the counsels of God and his advice. God therefore was not the author
of their sin; he left them to the lusts of their own hearts and the
counsels of their own heads; if they do not well, the blame must lie
upon their own hearts and the blood upon their own heads.

VI\. He testifies his good-will to them in wishing they had done well
for themselves. He saw how sad their case was, and how sure their ruin,
when they were delivered up to their own lusts; that is worse than being
given up to Satan, which may be in order to reformation ([Ti1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020).md) and to salvation ([Co1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005).md); but to be delivered up to their
own hearts' lusts is to be sealed under condemnation. He that is filthy,
let him be filthy still. What fatal precipices will not these hurry a
man to! Now here God looks upon them with pity, and shows that it was
with reluctance that he thus abandoned them to their folly and fate. How
shall I give thee up, Ephraim? [Hos
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008.md), [Hos
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009.md). So here, O that my people had
hearkened! See [Isa 48:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#018.md). Thus Christ
lamented the obstinacy of Jerusalem. If thou hadst known, [Luk
19:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#042.md). The expressions here are very
affecting ([Psa 81:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#013).md), designed to
show how unwilling God is that any should perish and desirous that all
should come to repentance (he delights not in the ruin of sinful persons
or nations), and also what enemies sinners are to themselves and what an
aggravation it will be of their misery that they might have been happy
upon such easy terms. Observe here,

1\. The great mercy God had in store for his people, and which he would
have wrought for them if they had been obedient. (1.) He would have
given them victory over their enemies and would soon have completed the
reduction of them. They should not only have kept their ground, but have
gained their point, against the remaining Canaanites, and their
encroaching vexatious neighbours ([Psa
81:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#014).md): I should have subdued their
enemies; and it is God only that is to be depended on for the subduing
of our enemies. Not would had have put them to the expense and fatigue
of a tedious war: he would soon have done it; for he would have turned
his hand against their adversaries, and then they would not have been
able to stand before them. It intimates how easily he would have done it
and without any difficulty. With the turn of a hand, nay, with the
breath of his mouth, shall he slay the wicked, [Isa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004.md). If he but turn his hand, the
haters of the Lord will submit themselves to him ([Psa
81:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#015).md); and, though they are not
brought to love him, yet they shall be made to fear him and to confess
that he is too hard for them and that it is in vain to contend with him.
God is honoured, and so is his Israel, by the submission of those that
have been in rebellion against them, though it be but a forced and
feigned submission. (2.) He would have confirmed and perpetuated their
posterity, and established it upon sure and lasting foundations. In
spite of all the attempts of their enemies against them, their time
should have endured for ever, and they should never have been disturbed
in the possession of the good land God had given them, much less evicted
and turned out of possession. (3.) He would have given them great plenty
of all good things ([Psa 81:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#016).md): He
should have fed them with the finest of the wheat, with the best grain
and the best of the kind. Wheat was the staple commodity of Canaan, and
they exported a great deal of it, [Eze
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#017.md). He would not only have provided
for them the best sort of bread, but with honey out of the rock would he
have satisfied them. Besides the precious products of the fruitful soil,
that there might not be a barren spot in all their land, even the clefts
of the rock should serve for bee-hives and in them they should find
honey in abundance. See [Deu 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#013.md),
[Deu 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#014.md). In short, God designed to
make them every way easy and happy.

2\. The duty God required from them as the condition of all this mercy.
He expected no more than that they should hearken to him, as a scholar
to his teacher, to receive his instructions - as a servant to his
master, to receive his commands; and that they should walk in his ways,
those ways of the Lord which are right and pleasant, that they should
observe the institutions of his ordinances and attend the intimations of
his providence. There was nothing unreasonable in this.

3\. Observe how the reason of the withholding of the mercy is laid in
their neglect of the duty: If they had hearkened to me, I would soon
have subdued their enemies. National sin or disobedience is the great
and only thing that retards and obstructs national deliverance. When I
would have healed Israel, and set every thing to-rights among them, then
the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and so a stop was put to the
cure, [Hos 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#001.md). We are apt to say, "If
such a method had been taken, such an instrument employed, we should
soon have subdued our enemies:" but we mistake; if we had hearkened to
God, and kept to our duty, the thing would have been done, but it is sin
that makes our troubles long and salvation slow. And this is that which
God himself complains of, and wishes it had been otherwise. Note,
Therefore God would have us do our duty to him, that we may be qualified
to receive favour from him. He delights in our serving him, not because
he is the better for it, but because we shall be.
