### [Daniel Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#001.md)

[Daniel](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">dan 10:0</span></span>

This chapter and the two next (which conclude this book) make up one
entire vision and prophecy, which was communicated to Daniel for the use
of the church, not by signs and figures, as before (ch. 7 and 8), but by
express words; and this was about two years after the vision in the
foregoing chapter. Daniel prayed daily, but had a vision only now and
then. In this chapter we have some things introductory to the prophecy,
in the eleventh chapter the particular predictions, and [Dan
12:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md) the conclusion of it. This
chapter shows us, I. Daniel's solemn fasting and humiliation, before he
had this vision ([Dan 10:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#001).md). II. A
glorious appearance of the Son of God to him, and the deep impression it
made upon him ([Dan 10:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#004).md). III. The
encouragement that was given him to expect such a discovery of future
events as should be satisfactory and useful both to others and to
himself, and that he should be enabled both to understand the meaning of
this discovery, though difficult, and to bear up under the lustre of it,
though dazzling and dreadful ([Dan
10:10-21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#010).md).

[Daniel 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 10:1</span></span>

This vision is dated in the third year of Cyrus, that is, of his reign
after the conquest of Babylon, his third year since Daniel became
acquainted with him and a subject to him. Here is,

I. A general idea of this prophecy ([Dan
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#001).md): The thing was true; every word
of God is so; it was true that Daniel had such a vision, and that such
and such things were said. This he solemnly attests upon the word of a
prophet. Et hoc paratus est verificare - He was prepared to verify it;
and, if it was a word spoken from heaven, no doubt it is stedfast and
may be depended upon. But the time appointed was long, as long as to the
end of the reign of Antiochus, which was 300 years, a long time indeed
when it is looked upon as to come. Nay, and because it is usual with the
prophets to glance at things spiritual and eternal, there is that in
this prophecy which looks in type as far forward as to the end of the
world and the resurrection of the dead; and then he might well say, The
time appointed was long. It was, however, made as plain to him as if it
had been a history rather than a prophecy; he understood the thing; so
distinctly was it delivered to him, and received by him, that he could
say he had understanding of the vision. It did not so much operate upon
his fancy as upon his understanding.

II\. An account of Daniel's mortification of himself before he had this
vision, not in expectation of it, nor, when he prayed that solemn prayer
ch. 9, does it appear that he had any expectation of the vision in
answer to it, but purely from a principle of devotion and pious sympathy
with the afflicted people of God. He was mourning full three weeks ([Dan
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#002).md), for his own sins and the sins
of his people, and their sorrows. Some think that the particular
occasion of his mourning was slothfulness and indifference of many of
the Jews, who, though they had liberty to return to their own land,
continued still in the land of their captivity, not knowing how to value
the privileges offered them; and perhaps it troubled him the more
because those that did so justified themselves by the example of Daniel,
though they had not that reason to stay behind which he had. Others
think that it was because he heard of the obstruction given to the
building of the temple by the enemies of the Jews, who hired counsellors
against them, to frustrate their purpose ([Ezr
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#004.md), [Ezr
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#005).md), all the days of Cyrus, and
gained their point from his son Cambyses, or Artaxerxes, who governed
while Cyrus was absent in the Scythian war. Note, Good men cannot but
mourn to see how slowly the work of God goes on in the world and what
opposition it meets with, how weak its friends are and how active its
enemies. During the days of Daniel's mourning he ate no pleasant bread;
he could not live without meat, but he ate little, and very sparingly,
and mortified himself in the quality as well as the quantity of what he
ate, which may truly be reckoned fasting, and a token of humiliation and
sorrow. He did not eat the pleasant bread he used to eat, but that which
was course and unpalatable, which he would not be tempted to eat any
more of than was just necessary to support nature. As ornaments, so
delicacies, are very disagreeable to a day of humiliation. Daniel ate no
flesh, drank no wine, nor anointed himself, for those three week's time,
[Dan 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#003.md). Though he was now a very
old man, and might plead that the decay of his nature required what was
nourishing, though he was a very great man, and might plead that, being
used to dainty meats, he could not do without them, it would prejudice
his health if he were, yet, when it was both to testify and to assist
his devotion, he could thus deny himself; let this be noted to the shame
of many young people in the common ranks of life who cannot persuade
themselves thus to deny themselves.

III\. A description of that glorious person whom Daniel saw in vision,
which, it is generally agreed, could be no other that Christ himself,
the eternal Word. He was by the side of the river Hiddekel ([Dan
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#004).md), probably walking there, not for
diversion, but devotion and contemplation, as Isaac walked in the field,
to meditate; and, being a person of distinction, he had his servants
attending him at some distance. There he looked up, and saw one man
Christ Jesus. It must be he, for he appears in the same resemblance
wherein he appeared to St. John in the isle of Patmos, [Rev
1:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#013.md). His dress was priestly, for
he is the high priest of our profession, clothed in linen, as the high
priest himself was on the day of atonement, that great day; his loins
were girded (in St. John's vision his paps were girded) with a golden
girdle of the finest gold, that of Uphaz, for every thing about Christ
is the best in its kind. The girding of the loins denotes his ready and
diligent application to his work, as his Father's servant, in the
business of our redemption. His shape was amiable, his body like the
beryl, a precious stone of a sky-colour. His countenance was awful, and
enough to strike a terror on the beholders, for his face was as the
appearance of lightning, which dazzles the eyes, both brightens and
threatens. His eyes were bright and sparkling, as lamps of fire. His
arms and feet shone like polished brass, [Dan
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#006.md). His voice was loud, and strong,
and very piercing, like the voice of a multitude. The vox Dei - voice of
God can overpower the vox populi - voice of the people. Thus glorious
did Christ appear, and it should engage us, 1. To think highly and
honourably of him. Now consider how great this man is, and in all things
let him have the pre-eminence. 2. To admire his condescension for us and
our salvation. Over all this splendour he drew a veil when he took upon
him the form of a servant, and emptied himself.

IV\. The wonderful influence that this appearance had upon Daniel and
his attendants, and the terror that it struck upon him and them.

1\. His attendants saw not the vision; it was not fit that they should
be honoured with the sight of it. There is a divine revelation
vouchsafed to all, from converse with which none are excluded who do not
exclude themselves; but such a vision must be peculiar to Daniel, who
was a favourite. Paul's companions were aware of the light, but saw no
man, [Act 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#007.md); [Act
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#009.md). Note, It is the honour of those
who are beloved of God that, what is hidden from others, is known to
them. Christ manifests himself to them, but not to the world, [Joh
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#022.md). But, though they saw not the
vision, they were seized with an unaccountable trembling; either from
the voice they heard, or from some strange concussion or vibration of
the air they felt, so it was that a great quaking fell upon them, so
that they fled to hide themselves, probably among the willows that grew
by the river's side. Note, Many have a spirit of bondage to fear who
never receive a spirit of adoption, to whom Christ has been, and will
be, never otherwise than a terror. Now the fright that Daniel's
attendants were in is a confirmation of the truth of the vision; it
could not be Daniel's fancy, or the product of a heated imagination of
his own, or it had a real, powerful, and strange effect upon those about
him.

2\. He himself saw it, and saw it alone, but he was not able to bear the
sight of it. It not only dazzled his eyes, but overwhelmed his spirit,
so that there remained no strength in him, [Dan
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#008.md). He said, as Moses himself, I
exceedingly fear and quake. His spirits were all so employed, either in
an intense speculation of the glory of this vision or in the fortifying
of his heart against the terror of it, that his body was left in a
manner lifeless and spiritless. He had no vigour in him, and was but one
remove from a dead carcase; he looked as pale as death, his colour was
gone, his comeliness in him was turned into corruption, and he retained
no strength. Note, the greatest and best of men cannot bear the
immediate discoveries of the divine glory; no man can see it and live;
it is next to death to see a glimpse of it, as Daniel here; but
glorified saints see Christ as he is and can bear the sight. But, though
Daniel was thus dispirited with the vision of Christ, yet he heard the
voice of his words and knew what he said. Note, We must take heed lest
our reverence of God's glory, by which we should be awakened to hear his
voice both in his word and in his providence, should degenerate into
such a dread of him as will disable or indispose us to hear it. It
should seem that when the vision of Christ terrified Daniel the voice of
his words soon pacified and composed him, silenced his fear, and laid
him to sleep in a holy security and serenity of mind: When I heard the
voice of his words I fell into a slumber, a sweet slumber, on my face,
and my face towards the ground. When he saw the vision he threw himself
prostrate, into a posture of the most humble adoration, and dropped
asleep, not as careless of what he heard and saw, but charmed with it.
Note, How dreadful soever Christ may appear to those who are under
convictions of sin, and in terror by reason of it, there is enough in
his word to quiet their spirits and make them easy, if they will but
attend to it and apply it.

[Daniel 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 10:10</span></span>

Much ado here is to bring Daniel to be able to bear what Christ has to
say to him. Still we have him in a fright, hardly and very slowly
recovering himself; but he is still answered and supported with good
words and comfortable words. Let us see how Daniel is by degrees brought
to himself, and gather up the several passages that are to the same
purport.

I. Daniel is in a great consternation and finds it very difficult to get
clear of it. The hand that touched him set him at first upon his knees
and the palms of his hands, [Dan
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#010.md). Note, Strength and comfort
commonly come by degrees to those that have been long cast down and
disquieted; they are first helped up a little, and then more. After two
days he will revive us, and then the third day he will raise us up. And
we must not despise the day of small things, but be thankful for the
beginnings of mercy. Afterwards he is helped up, but he stands trembling
([Dan 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#011).md), for fear lest he fall
again. Note, Before God gives strength and power unto his people he
makes them sensible of their own weakness. I trembled in myself, that I
might rest in the day of trouble, [Hab
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#016.md). But when, afterwards, Daniel
recovered so much strength in his limbs that he could stand steadily,
yet he tells us ([Dan 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#015).md) that he
set his face towards the ground and became dumb; he was as a man
astonished, who knew not what to say, struck dumb with admiration and
fear, and was loth to enter into discourse with one so far above him; he
kept silence, yea, even from good, till he had recollected himself a
little. Well, at length he recovered, not only the use of his feet, but
the use of his tongue; and, when he opened his mouth ([Dan
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#016).md), that which he had to say was
to excuse his having been so long silent, for really he durst not speak,
he could not speak: "O my lord" (so, in great humility, this prophet
calls the angel, though the angels, in great humility, called themselves
fellow-servants to the prophets, [Rev
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#009).md), "by the vision my sorrows are
turned upon me; they break in upon me with violence; the sense of my
sinful sorrowful state turns upon me when I see thy purity and
brightness." Note, Man, who has lost his integrity, has reason to blush,
and be ashamed of himself, when he sees or considers the glory of the
blessed angels that keep their integrity. "My sorrows are turned upon
me, and I have retained no strength to resist them or bear up a head
against them." And again ([Dan 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#017).md),
like one half dead with the fright, he complains, "As for me,
straightway there remained no strength in me to receive these displays
of the divine glory and these discoveries of the divine will; nay, there
is no breath left in me." Such a deliquium did he suffer that he could
not draw one breath after another, but panted and languished, and was in
a manner breathless. See how well it is for us that the treasure of
divine revelation is put into earthen vessels, that God speaks to us by
men like ourselves and not by angels. Whatever we may wish, in a peevish
dislike of the method God takes in dealing with us, it is certain that
if we were tried we should all be of Israel's mind at Mt. Sinai, when
they said to Moses, Speak thou to us, and we will hear, but let not God
speak to us lest we die, [Exo 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#019.md).
If Daniel could not bear it, how could we? Now this he insists upon as
an excuse for his irreverent silence, which otherwise would have been
blame-worthy: How can the servant of this my lord talk with this my
lord? [Dan 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#017.md). Note, Whenever we
enter into communion with God it becomes us to have a due sense of the
vast distance and disproportion that there are between us and the holy
angels, and of the infinite distance, and no proportion at all, between
us and the holy God, and to acknowledge that we cannot order our speech
by reason of darkness. How shall we that are dust and ashes speak to the
Lord of glory?

II\. The blessed angel that was employed by Christ to converse with him
gave him all the encouragement and comfort that could be. It should
seem, it was not he whose glory he saw in vision ([Dan
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#005.md), [Dan
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#006).md) that here touched him, and
talked with him; that was Christ, but this seems to have been the angel
Gabriel, whom Christ had once before ordered to instruct Daniel, [Dan
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#016.md). That glorious appearance (as
that of the God of glory to Abraham, [Act
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002).md) was to give authority and to gain
attention to what the angel should say. Christ himself comforted John
when he in a like case fell at his feet as dead ([Rev
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#017).md); but here he did it by the
angel, whom Daniel saw in a glory much inferior to that of the vision in
the verses before; for he was like the similitude of the sons of men
([Dan 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#016).md), one like the appearance
of a man, [Dan 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#018.md). When he only
appeared, as he had done before ([Dan
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021).md), we do not find that Daniel was
put into any disorder by it, as he was by this vision; and therefore he
is here employed a third time with Daniel.

1\. He lent him his hand to help him, touched him, and set him upon his
hands and knees ([Dan 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#010).md), else he
would still have lain grovelling, touched his lips ([Dan
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#016).md), else he would have been still
dumb; again he touched him ([Dan
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#018).md), and put strength into him,
else he would still have been staggering and trembling. Note, The hand
of God's power going along with the word of his grace is alone effectual
to redress all our grievances, and to rectify whatever is amiss in us.
One touch from heaven brings us to our knees, sets us on our feet, opens
our lips, and strengthens us; for it is God that works on us, and works
in us, both to will and to do that which is good.

2\. He assured him of the great favour that God had for him: Thou art a
man greatly beloved ([Dan 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#011).md); and
again ([Dan 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#019).md), O man greatly
beloved! Note, Nothing is more likely, nothing more effectual, to revive
the drooping spirits of the saints than to be assured of God's love to
them. Those are greatly beloved indeed whom God loves; and it is comfort
enough to know it.

3\. He silenced his fears, and encouraged his hopes, with good words and
comfortable words. He said unto him, Fear not, Daniel ([Dan
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#012).md); and again ([Dan
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#019).md), O man greatly beloved! fear
not; peace be unto thee; be strong, yea, be strong. Never did any tender
mother quiet her child, when any thing had grieved or frightened it,
with more compassion and affection than the angel here quieted Daniel.
Those that are beloved of God have no reason to be afraid of any evil;
peace is to them; God himself speaks peace to them; and they ought, upon
the warrant of that, to speak peace to themselves; and that peace, that
joy of the Lord, will be their strength. Will God plead against us with
his great power? will he take advantage against us of our being overcome
by his terror? No, but he will put strength into us, [Job
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006.md). So he did into Daniel here,
when, by reason of the lustre of the vision, no strength of his own
remained in him; and he acknowledges it ([Dan
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#019).md): When he had spoken to me I was
strengthened. Note, God by his word puts life, and strength, and spirit
into his people; for if he says, Be strong, power goes along with the
word. And, now that Daniel has experienced the efficacy of God's
strengthening word and grace, he is ready for any thing: "Now, Let my
lord speak, and I can hear it, I can bear it, and am ready to do
according to it, for thou hast strengthened me." Note, To those that
(like Daniel here) have no might God increases strength, [Isa
40:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#029.md). And we cannot keep up our
communion with God but by strength derived from him; but, when he is
pleased to put strength into us, we must make a good use of it, and say,
Speak, Lord, for thy servant hears. Let God enable us to comply with his
will, and them, whatever it is, we will stand complete in it. Da quod
jubes, et jube quod vis - Give what thou commandest, and then command
what thou wilt.

4\. He assured him that his fastings and prayers had come up for a
memorial before God, as the angel told Cornelius ([Act
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#004).md): Fear not, Daniel, [Dan
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#012.md). It is natural to fallen man to
be afraid of an extraordinary messenger from heaven, as dreading to hear
evil tidings thence; but Daniel need not fear, for he has by his three
weeks' humiliation and supplication sent extraordinary messengers to
heaven, which he may expect to return with an olive-branch of peace:
"From the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand the word
of God, which is to be the rule of thy prayers, and to chasten thyself
before thy God, that thou mightest put an edge upon thy prayers, thy
words were heard," as, before, at the beginning of thy supplication,
[Dan 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#023.md). Note, As the entrance of
God's word is enlightening to the upright, so the entrance of their
prayers is pleasing to God, [Psa
119:130](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#130.md). From the first day that we
begin to look towards God in a way of duty he is ready to meet us in a
way of mercy. Thus ready is God to hear prayer. I said, I will confess,
and thou forgavest. 5. He informed him that he was sent to him on
purpose to bring him a prediction of the future state of the church, as
a token of God's accepting his prayers for the church: "Knowest thou
wherefore I come unto thee? If thou knewest on what errand I come, thou
wouldst not be put into such a consternation by it." Note, If we rightly
understood the meaning of God's dealings with us, and the methods of his
providence and grace concerning us, we should be better reconciled to
them. "I have come for thy words ([Dan
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#012).md), to bring thee a gracious
answer to thy prayers." Thus, when God's praying people call to him, he
says, Here I am ([Isa 58:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#009).md); what
would you have with me? See the power of prayer, what glorious things it
has, in its time, fetched from heaven, what strange discoveries! On what
errand did this angel come to Daniel? He tells him ([Dan
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#014).md): I have come to make thee
understand what shall befal thy people in the latter days. Daniel was a
curious inquisitive man, that had all his days been searching into
secret things, and it would be a great gratification to him to be let
into the knowledge of things to come. Daniel had always been concerned
for the church; its interests lay much upon his heart, and it would be a
particular satisfaction to him to know what its state should be, and he
would know the better what to pray for as long as he lived. He was now
lamenting the difficulties which his people met with in the present day;
but, that he might not be offended in those, the angel must tell him
what greater difficulties are yet before them; and, if they be wearied
now that they only run with the footmen, how will they contend with
horses? Note, It would abate our resentment of present troubles to
consider that we know not but much greater are before us, which we are
concerned to provide for. Daniel must be made to know what shall befal
his people in the latter days of the church, after the cessation of
prophecy, and when the time drew nigh for the Messiah to appear, for yet
the vision is for many days; the principal things that this vision was
intended to give the church the foresight of would come to pass in the
days of Antiochus, nearly 300 years after this. Now that which the angel
is entrusted to communicate to Daniel, and which Daniel is encouraged to
expect from him, is not any curious speculations, moral
prognostications, nor rational prospects of his own, though he is an
angel, but what he has received from the Lord. It was the revelation of
Jesus Christ that the angel gave to St. John to be delivered to the
churches, [Rev 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001.md). So here ([Dan
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021).md): I will show thee what is
written in the scriptures of truth, that is, what is fixed in the
determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God. The decree of God is a
thing written, it is a scripture which remains and cannot be altered.
What I have written I have written. As there are scriptures for the
revealed will of God, the letters-patent, which are published to the
world, so there are scriptures for the secret will of God, the close
rolls, which are sealed among his treasures, the book of his decrees.
Both are scriptures of truth; nothing shall be added to nor taken from
either of them. The secret things belong not to us, only now and then
some few paragraphs have been copied out from the book of God's
counsels, and delivered to the prophets for the use of the church, as
here to Daniel; but they are the things revealed, even the words of this
law, which belong to us and to our children; and we are concerned to
study what is written in these scriptures of truth, for they are things
which belong to our everlasting peace.

6\. He gave him a general account of the adversaries of the church's
cause, from whom it might be expected that troubles would arise, and of
its patrons, under whose protection it might be assured of safety and
victory at last. (1.) The kings of the earth are and will be its
adversaries; for they set themselves against the Lord, and against his
Anointed, [Psa 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#002.md). The angel told
Daniel that he was to have come to him with a gracious answer to his
prayers, but that the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood him one
and twenty days, just the three weeks that Daniel had been fasting and
praying. Cambyses king of Persia had been very busy to embarrass the
affairs of the Jews, and to do them all the mischief he could, and the
angel had been all that time employed to counter-work him; so that he
had been constrained to defer his visit to Daniel till now, for angels
can be but in one place at a time. Or, as Dr. Lightfoot says, This new
king of Persia, by hindering the temple, had hindered those good tidings
which otherwise he should have brought him. The kings and kingdoms of
the world were indeed sometimes helpful to the church, but more often
they were injurious to it. "When I have gone forth from the kings of
Persia, when their monarchy is brought down for their unkindness to the
Jews, then the prince of Grecia shall come," [Dan
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#020.md). The Grecian monarchy, though
favourable to the Jews at first, as the Persian was, will yet come to be
vexatious to them. Such is the state of the church-militant; when it has
got clear of one enemy it has another to encounter: and such a hydra's
head is that of the old serpent; when one storm has blown over it is not
long before another rises. (2.) The God of heaven is, and will be, its
protector, and, under him, the angels of heaven are its patrons and
guardians. \[1.\] Here is the angel Gabriel busy in the service of the
church, making his part good in defence of it twenty-one days, against
the prince of Persia, and remaining there with the kings of Persia, as
consul, or liege-ambassador, to take care of the affairs of the Jews in
that court, and to do them service, [Dan
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013.md). And, though much was done
against them by the kings of Persia (God permitting it), it is probably
that much more mischief would have been done them, and they would have
been quite ruined (witness Haman's plot) if God had not prevented it by
the ministration of angels. Gabriel resolves, when he has despatched
this errand to Daniel, that he will return to fight with the prince of
Persia, will continue to oppose him, and will at length humble and bring
down that proud monarchy (v. 20), though he knows that another as
mischievous, even that of Grecia, will rise instead of it. \[2.\] Here
is Michael our prince, the great protector of the church, and the patron
of its just but injured cause: The first of the chief princes, [Dan
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013.md). Some understand it of a created
angel, but an archangel of the highest order, [Th1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016.md); [Jde
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009.md). Others think that Michael the
archangel is no other than Christ himself, the angel of the covenant,
and the Lord of the angels, he whom Daniel saw in vision, [Dan
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#005.md). He came to help me ([Dan
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013).md); and there is none but he that
holds with me in these things, [Dan
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021.md). Christ is the church's prince;
angels are not, [Heb 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#005.md). He presides
in the affairs of the church and effectually provides for its good. He
is said to hold with the angels, for it is he that makes them
serviceable to the heirs of salvation; and, if he were not on the
church's side, its case were bad. But, says David, and so says the
church, The Lord takes my part with those that help me, [Psa
118:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#007.md). The Lord is with those that
uphold my soul, [Psa 54:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#004.md).
