### [Deuteronomy Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 23:0</span></span>

The laws of this chapter provide, I. For the preserving of the purity
and honour of the families of Israel, by excluding such as would be a
disgrace to them ([Deu 23:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001).md). II.
For the preserving of the purity and honour of the camp of Israel when
it was abroad ([Deu 23:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#009).md). III. For
the encouraging and entertaining of slaves who fled to them ([Deu
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#015.md), [Deu
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#016).md). IV. Against whoredom ([Deu
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#017.md), [Deu
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#018).md). V. Against usury ([Deu
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#019.md), [Deu
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#020).md). IV. Against the breach of vows
([Deu 23:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#021).md). VII. What liberty a
man might take in his neighbour's field and vineyard, and what not ([Deu
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#023.md), [Deu
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#025).md).

[Deuteronomy 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 23:1</span></span>

Interpreters are not agreed what is here meant by entering into the
congregation of the Lord, which is here forbidden to eunuchs and to
bastards, Ammonites and Moabites, for ever, but to Edomites and
Egyptians only till the third generation. 1. Some think they are hereby
excluded from communicating with the people of God in their religious
services. Though eunuchs and bastards were owned as members of the
church, and the Ammonites and Moabites might be circumcised and
proselyted to the Jewish religion, yet they and their families must lie
for some time under marks of disgrace, remembering the rock whence they
were hewn, and must not come so near the sanctuary as others might, nor
have so free a communion with Israelites. 2. Others think they are
hereby excluded from bearing office in the congregation: none of these
must be elders or judges, lest the honour of the magistracy should
thereby be stained. 3. Others think they are excluded only from marrying
with Israelites. Thus the learned bishop Patrick inclines to understand
it; yet we find that when this law was put in execution after the
captivity they separated from Israel, not only the strange wives, but
all the mixed multitude, see [Neh
13:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#001.md). With the daughters of these
nations (though out of the nations of Canaan), it should seem, the men
of Israel might marry, if they were completely proselyted to the Jewish
religion; but with the men of these nations the daughters of Israel
might not marry, nor could the men be naturalized otherwise than as here
provided.

It is plain, in general, that disgrace is here put,

I. Upon bastards and eunuchs, [Deu
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001.md), [Deu
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#002.md). By bastards here the Jewish
writers understand, not all that were born of fornication, or out of
marriage, but all the issue of those incestuous mixtures which are
forbidden, Lev. 18. And, though it was not the fault of the issue, yet,
to deter people from those unlawful marriages and unlawful lusts, it was
very convenient that their posterity should thus be made infamous. By
this rule Jephthah, though the son of a harlot, a strange woman ([Jdg
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#001.md), [Jdg
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#002).md), yet was not a bastard in the
sense of this law. And as for the eunuchs, though by this law they
seemed to be cast out of the vineyard as dry trees, which they complain
of ([Isa 56:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#003).md), yet it is here
promised ([Deu 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#005).md) that if they took
care of their duty to God, as far as they were admitted, by keeping his
sabbaths and choosing the things that pleased him, the want of this
privilege should be made up to them with such spiritual blessings as
would entitle them to an everlasting name.

II\. Upon Ammonites and Moabites, the posterity of Lot, who, for his
outward convenience, had separated himself from Abraham, [Gen
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#011.md). And we do not find that he or
his ever joined themselves again to the children of the covenant. They
are here cut off to the tenth generation, that is, (as some think it is
explained), for ever. Compare [Neh
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#001.md). The reason of this quarrel which
Israel must have with them, so as not to seek their peace ([Deu
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#006).md), is because of the unkindness
they had now lately done to the camp of Israel, notwithstanding the
orders God had given not to distress or vex them, [Deu
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009.md), [Deu
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#019.md). 1. It was bad enough that they
did not meet them with bread and water in the way ([Deu
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#004).md), that they did not as allies, or
at least as neutral states, bring victuals into their camp, which they
should have been duly paid for. It was well that God's Israel did not
need their kindness, God himself following them with bread and water.
However this omission of the Ammonites should be remembered against
their nation in future ages. Note, God will certainly reckon, not only
with those that oppose his people, but with those that do not help and
further them, when it is in the power of their hand to do it. The charge
at the great day is for an omission: I was hungry, and you gave me no
meat. 2. The Moabites had done worse, they hired Balaam to curse Israel,
[Deu 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#004.md). It is true God turned the
curse into a blessing ([Deu 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#005).md), not
only changing the word in Balaam's mouth, but making that really turn to
the honour and advantage of Israel which was designed for their ruin.
But though the design was defeated, and overruled for good, the
Moabites' wickedness was not the less provoking. God will deal with
sinners, but according to their endeavours, [Psa
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#004.md).

III\. The Edomites and Egyptians had not so deep a mark of displeasure
put upon them as the Moabites and Ammonites had. If an Edomite or
Egyptian turned proselyte, his grand-children should be looked upon as
members of the congregation of the Lord to all intents and purposes,
[Deu 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#007.md), [Deu
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#008.md). We should think that the
Edomites had been more injurious to the Israelites than the Ammonites,
and deserved as little favour from them ([Num
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#020).md), and yet "Thou shalt not abhor
an Edomite, as thou must an Ammonite, for he is thy brother." Note, The
unkindness of near relations, though by many worst taken, yet should
with us, for that reason, because of the relation, be first forgiven.
And then, as to the Egyptians, here is a strange reason given why they
must not be abhorred: "Thou wast a stranger in their land, and
therefore, though hardly used there, be civil to them, for old
acquaintance' sake." They must not remember their bondage in Egypt for
the keeping up of any ill will to the Egyptians, but only for the
magnifying of Gods power and goodness in their deliverance.

[Deuteronomy 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 23:9</span></span>

Israel was now encamped, and this vast army was just entering upon
action, which was likely to keep them together for a long time, and
therefore it was fit to give them particular directions for the good
ordering of their camp. And the charge is in one word to be clean. They
must take care to keep their camp pure from moral, ceremonial, and
natural pollution.

I. From moral pollution ([Deu 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#009).md):
When the host goes forth against thy enemy then look upon thyself as in
a special manner engaged to keep thyself from every evil thing. 1. The
soldiers themselves must take heed of sin, for sin takes off the edge of
valour; guilt makes men cowards. Those that put their lives in their
hands are concerned to make and keep their peace with God, and preserve
a conscience void of offence; then may they look death in the face
without terror. Soldiers, in executing their commission, must keep
themselves from gratifying the lusts of malice, covetousness, or
uncleanness, for these are wicked things - must keep themselves from the
idols, or accursed things, they found in the camps they plundered. 2.
Even those that tarried at home, the body of the people, and every
particular person, must at that time especially keep from every wicked
thing, lest by sin they provoke God to withdraw his presence from the
host, and give victory to the enemy for the correcting of his own
people. Times of war should be times of reformation, else how can we
expect God should hear and answer our prayers for success? [Psa
66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018.md). See [Sa1
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#003.md).

II\. From ceremonial pollution, which might befal a person when
unconscious of it, for which he was bound to wash his flesh in water,
and look upon himself as unclean until the evening, [Lev
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#016.md). A soldier, notwithstanding the
constant service and duty he had to do in the camp, must be so far from
looking upon himself as discharged from the observance of this ceremony
that more was required from him than at another time; had he been at his
own house, he needed only to wash his flesh, but, being in the army, he
must go abroad out of the camp, as one concerned to keep it pure and
ashamed of his own impurity, and not return till after sunset, [Deu
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#010.md), [Deu
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#011.md). By this trouble and reproach,
which even involuntary pollutions exposed men to, they were taught to
keep up a very great dread of all fleshly lusts. It were well if
military men would consider this.

III\. From natural pollution; the camp of the Lord must have nothing
offensive in it, [Deu 23:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#012.md). It is
strange that the divine law, or at least the solemn order and direction
of Moses, should extend to a thing of this nature; but the design of it
was to teach them, 1. Modesty and decorum; nature itself teaches them
thus to distinguish themselves from beasts that know no shame. 2.
Cleanliness, and, though not niceness, yet neatness, even in their camp.
Filthiness is offensive to the senses God has endued us with,
prejudicial to the health, a wrong to the comfort of human life, and an
evidence of a careless slothful temper of mind. 3. Purity from the
pollutions of sin; if there must be this care taken to preserve the body
clean and sweet, much more should we be solicitous to keep the mind so.
4. A reverence of the divine majesty. This is the reason here given: For
the Lord thy God walketh by his ark, the special token of his presence,
in the midst of thy camp; with respect to that external symbol this
external purity is required, which (though not insisted on in the letter
when that reason ceases) teaches us to preserve inward purity of soul,
in consideration of the eye of God, which is always upon us. By this
expression of respect to the presence of God among them, they were
taught both to fortify themselves against sin and to encourage
themselves against their enemies with the consideration of that
presence. 5. A regard one to another. The filthiness of one is noisome
to many; this law of cleanliness therefore teaches us not to do that
which will be justly offensive to our brethren and grieve them. It is a
law against nuisances.

[Deuteronomy 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 23:15</span></span>

Orders are here given about five several things which have no relation
one to another: -

I. The land of Israel is here made a sanctuary, or city of refuge, for
servants that were wronged and abused by their masters, and fled thither
for shelter from the neighbouring countries, [Deu
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#015.md), [Deu
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#016.md). We cannot suppose that they
were hereby obliged to give entertainment to all the unprincipled men
that ran from service; Israel needed not (as Rome at first did) to be
thus peopled. But, 1. They must not deliver up the trembling servant to
his enraged master, till upon trial it appeared that the servant has
wronged his master and was justly liable to punishment. Note, It is an
honourable thing to shelter and protect the weak, provided they be not
wicked. God allows his people to patronise the oppressed. The angel bid
Hagar return to her mistress, and Paul sent Onesimus back to his master
Philemon, because they had neither of them any cause to go away, nor was
either of them exposed to any danger in returning. But the servant here
is supposed to escape, that is, to run for his life, to the people of
Israel, of whom he had heard (as Benhadad of the kings of Israel, [Kg1
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#031).md) that they were a merciful
people, to save himself from the fury of a tyrant; and in that case to
deliver him up is to throw a lamb into the mouth of a lion. 2. If it
appeared that the servant was abused, they must not only protect him,
but, supposing him willing to embrace their religion, they must give him
all the encouragement that might be to settle among them. Care is taken
both that he should not be imposed up on in the place of his settlement
- let it be that which he shall choose and where it liketh him best, and
that he should not exchange one hard master for many - thou shalt not
oppress him. Thus would he soon find a comfortable difference between
the land of Israel and other lands, and would choose it to be his rest
for ever. Note, Proselytes and converts to the truth should be treated
with particular tenderness, that they may have no temptation to return.

II\. The land of Israel must be no shelter for the unclean; no whore, no
Sodomite, must be suffered to live among them ([Plm
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#017.md), [Plm
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#018).md), neither a whore nor a
whoremonger. No houses of uncleanness must be kept either by men or
women. Here is, 1. A good reason intimated why there should be no such
wickedness tolerated among them: they were Israelites. This seems to
have an emphasis laid upon it. For a daughter of Israel to be a whore,
or a son of Israel a whoremaster, is to reproach the stock they are come
of, the people they belong to, and the God they worship. It is bad in
any, but worst in Israelites, a holy nation, [Sa2
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#012.md). 2. A just mark of displeasure
put upon this wickedness, that the hire of a whore, that is, the money
she gets by her whoring, and the price of a dog, that is, of the
Sodomite, pimp, or whoremaster (so I incline to understand it, for such
are called dogs, [Rev 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015).md), the
money he gets by his lewd and villainous practices, no part of it shall
be brought into the house of the Lord (as the hire of prostitutes among
the Gentiles was into their temples) for any vow. This intimates, (1.)
That God would not accept of any offering at all from such wicked
people; they had nothing to bring an offering of but what they got by
their wickedness, and therefore their sacrifice could not but be an
abomination to the Lord, [Pro 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#008.md).
(2.) That they should not think, by making and paying vows, and bringing
offerings to the Lord, to obtain leave to go on in this sin, as (it
should seem) some that followed that trade suggested to themselves, when
their offerings were admitted. [Pro
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#014.md), [Pro
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#015.md), This day have I paid my vows,
therefore came I forth to meet thee. Nothing should be accepted in
commutation of penance. (3.) That we cannot honour God with our
substance unless it be honestly and honourably come by. It must not only
be considered what we give, but how we got it; God hates robbery for
burnt-offerings, and uncleanness too.

III\. The matter of usury is here settled, [Deu
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#019.md), [Deu
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#020). (1..md) They must not lend upon
usury to an Israelite. They had and held their estates immediately from
and under God, who, while he distinguished them from all other people,
might have ordered, had he so pleased, that they should have all things
in common among themselves; but instead of that, and in token of their
joint interest in the good land he had given them, he only appointed
them, as there was occasion, to lend to one another without interest,
which among them would be little or no loss to the lender, because their
land was so divided, their estates were so settled, and there was so
little of merchandise among them, that it was seldom or never that they
had occasion to borrow any great sums, only what was necessary for the
subsistence of their families when the fruits of their ground had met
with any disaster, or the like; and, in such a case, for a small matter
to insist upon usury would have been very barbarous. Where the borrower
gets, or hopes to get, it is just that the lender should share in the
gain; but to him that borrows for his necessary food pity must be shown,
and we must lend, hoping for nothing again, if we have wherewithal to do
it, [Luk 6:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#035). (2..md) They might lend
upon usury to a stranger, who was supposed to live by trade, and (as we
say) by turning the penny, and therefore got by what he borrowed, and
came among them in hopes to do so. By this it appears that usury is not
in itself oppressive; for they must not oppress a stranger, and yet
might exact usury from him.

IV\. The performance of the vows wherewith we have bound our souls is
here required; and it is a branch of the law of nature, [Deu
23:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#021). (1..md) We are here left at our
liberty whether we will make vows or no: If thou shalt forbear to vow
(some particular sacrifice and offering, more than was commanded by the
law), it shall be no sin to thee. God had already signified his
readiness to accept a free-will offering thus vowed, though it were but
a little fine flour ([Lev 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004), etc..md),
which was encouragement enough to those who were so inclined. But lest
the priests, who had the largest share of those vows and voluntary
offerings, should sponge upon the people, by pressing it upon them as
their duty to make such vows, beyond their ability and inclination, they
are here expressly told that it should not be reckoned a sin in them if
they did not make any such vows, as it would be if they omitted any of
the sacrifices that God had particularly required. For (as bishop
Patrick well expresses it) God would have men to be easy in his service,
and all their offerings to be free and cheerful. (2.) We are here laid
under the highest obligations, when we have made a vow, to perform it,
and to perform it speedily: "Thou shalt not be slack to pay it, lest if
it be delayed beyond the first opportunity the zeal abate, the vow be
forgotten, or something happen to disable thee for the performance of
it. That which has gone out of thy lips as a solemn and deliberate vow
must not be recalled, but thou shalt keep and perform it, punctually and
fully." The rule of the gospel goes somewhat further than this. [Co2
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007.md), Every one, according as he
purposeth in his heart, though it have not gone out of his lips, so let
him give. Here is a good reason why we should pay our vows, that if we
do not God will require it of us, will surely and severely reckon with
us, not only for lying, but for going about to mock him, who cannot be
mocked. See [Ecc 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#004.md).

V. Allowance is here given, when they passed through a cornfield or
vineyard, to pluck and eat of the corn or grapes that grew by the
road-side, whether it was done for necessity or delight, only they must
carry none away with them, [Deu 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#024.md),
[Deu 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#025.md). Therefore the disciples
were not censured for plucking the ears of corn (it was well enough
known that the law allowed it), but for doing it on the sabbath day,
which the tradition of the elders had forbidden. Now, 1. This law
intimated to them what great plenty of corn and wine they should have in
Canaan, so much that a little would not be missed out of their fruits:
they should have enough for themselves and all their friends. 2. It
provided for the support of poor travellers, to relieve the fatigue of
their journey, and teaches us to be kind to such. The Jews say, "This
law was chiefly intended in favour of labourers, who were employed in
gathering in their harvest and vintage; their mouths must not be muzzled
any more than that of the ox when he treads out the corn." 3. It teaches
us not to insist upon property in a small matter, of which it is easy to
say, What is that between me and thee? It was true the grapes which the
passenger ate were none of his own, nor did the proprietor give them to
him; but the thing was of so small value that he had reason to think
were he present, he would not deny them to him, anymore than he himself
would grudge the like courtesy, and therefore it was no theft to take
them. 4. It used them to hospitality, and teaches us to be ready to
distribute, willing to communicate, and not to think every thing lost
that is given away. Yet, 4. It forbids us to abuse the kindness of our
friends, and to take the advantage of fair concessions to make
unreasonable encroachments: we must not draw an ell from those that give
but an inch. They may eat of their neighbour's grapes; but it does not
therefore follow that they may carry away.
