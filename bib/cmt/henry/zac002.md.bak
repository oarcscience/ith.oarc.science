### [Zechariah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#001.md)

[Zechariah](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">zac 2:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have, I. Another vision which the prophet saw, not
for his own entertainment, but for his satisfaction and the edification
of those to whom he was sent ([Zac
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#001.md), [Zac
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#002).md). II. A sermon upon it, in the
rest of the chapter, 1. By way of explication of the vision, showing it
to be a prediction of the replenishing of Jerusalem and of its safety
and honour ([Zac 2:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#003).md). 2. By way of
application. Here is, (1.) A use of exhortation to the Jews that were
yet in Babylon, pressing them to hasten their return to their own land,
([Zac 2:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#006)). (2..md) A use of
consolation tot hose that were returned, in reference to the many
difficulties they had to struggle with ([Zac
2:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#010)). (3..md) A use of caution to all
not to prescribe to God, or limit him, but patiently to wait for him
([Zac 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#013).md).

[Zechariah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 2:1</span></span>

This prophet was ordered, in God's name, to assure the people ([Zac
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#016).md) that a line should be stretched
forth upon Jerusalem. Now here we have that promise illustrated and
confirmed, that the prophet might deliver that part of his message to
the people with the more clearness and assurance.

I. He sees, in a vision, a man going to measure Jerusalem ([Zac
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#001.md), [Zac
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#002).md): He lifted up his eyes again, and
looked. God had shown him that which was very encouraging to him, ([Zac
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#020).md), and therefore now he lifted up
his eyes again and looked. Note, The comfortable sights which by faith
we have had of God's goodness made to pass before us should engage us to
lift up our eyes again, and to search further into the discoveries made
to us of the divine grace; for there is still more to be seen. In the
close of the foregoing chapter he had seen Jerusalem's enemies baffled
and broken, so that now he begins to hope she shall not be ruined. But
that is not enough to make her happy, and therefore that is not all that
is promised. Here is more carpenter's work to be done. When David had
resolved to cut off the horns of the wicked he engaged likewise that the
horns of the righteous should be exalted, [Psa
75:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#010.md). And so does the Son of David
here; for he is the man, even the man Christ Jesus, whom the prophet
sees with a measuring line in his hand; for he is the master builder of
his church ([Heb 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#003).md), and he builds
exactly by line and level. Zechariah took the boldness to ask him
whither he was going and what he designed to do with that measuring
line. And he readily told him that he was going to measure Jerusalem, to
take a particular account of the dimensions of it each way, that it
might be computed what was necessary for the making of a wall about it,
and that it might appear, by comparing its dimensions with the vast
numbers that should inhabit it, what additions were necessary to be made
for the receiving and containing of them; when multitudes flock to
Jerusalem ([Isa 60:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#004).md) it is time for
her to enlarge the place of her tent, [Isa
54:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#002.md). Note, God takes notice of the
extent of his church, and will take care that, when ever so many guests
are brought in to the wedding supper, still there shall be room, [Luk
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#022.md). In the New Jerusalem, my
Father's house above, there are many mansions.

II\. He is informed that this vision means well to Jerusalem, that the
measuring line he saw was not a line of confusion (as that [Isa
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011).md), not a line to mete out for
destruction, as when God purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of
Zion he stretched out a line ([Lam
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#008).md); but it is as when he divided the
inheritance by line, [Psa 78:55](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#055.md). The
angel that talked with the prophet went forth, as he designed, to
measure Jerusalem, but another angel went out to meet him, to desire
that he would first explain this vision to the prophet, that it might
not occasion him any uneasy speculations: Run, and speak to this young
man (for, it seems, the prophet entered upon his prophecy when he was
young, yet no man ought to despise his youth when God thus highly
honoured it); he is a young man, not experienced, and may be ready to
fear the worst; therefore bid him hope the best; tell him that Jerusalem
shall be both safe and great, 1. As safe and great as numbers of men can
make it ([Zac 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#004).md): Jerusalem shall be
inhabited as towns without walls; the inhabitants of it shall increase,
and multiply, and replenish it to admiration, so that it shall extend
itself far beyond the present dimensions which now there is an account
taken of. The walls of a city, as they defend it, so they straiten and
confine it, and keep its inhabitants from multiplying beyond such a
pitch; but Jerusalem, even when it is walled, to keep off the enemy,
shall be inhabited as towns without walls. The city shall be in a manner
lost in the suburbs, as London is, where the out-parishes are more
populous than those within the walls. So shall it be with Jerusalem; it
shall be extended as freely as if it had no walls at all, and yet shall
be as safe as if it had the strongest walls, such a multitude of men
(which are the best walls of a city) shall there be therein, and of
cattle too, to be not only food, but wealth too, for those men. Note,
The increase of the numbers of a people is a great blessing, is a fruit
of God's blessing on them and an earnest of further blessings, [Psa
107:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#038.md). They are multiplied, for he
blesses them. 2. As safe and great as the presence of God can make it,
[Zac 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005). (1..md) It shall be safe, for
God himself will be a wall of fire round about it. Jerusalem had no
walls about it at this time, but lay naked and exposed; formerly, when
it had walls, the enemies not only broke through them, but broke them
down; but now God will be unto her a wall of fire. Some think it alludes
to shepherds that made fires about their flocks, or travellers that made
fires about their tents in desert places, to frighten wild beasts from
them. God will not only make a hedge about them as he did about Job
([Zac 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#010).md), not only make walls and
bulwarks about them, [Isa 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md) (those
may be battered down), not only be as the mountains round about them,
[Psa 125:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#002.md) (mountains may be got
over), but he will be a wall of fire round them, which cannot be broken
through, nor scaled, nor undermined, nor the foundations of it sapped,
nor can it be attempted, or approached, without danger to the
assailants. God will not only make a wall of fire about her, but he will
himself be such a wall; for our God is a consuming fire to his and his
church's enemies. He is a wall of fire, not on one side only, but round
about on every side. (2.) It shall be great, for God himself will be the
glory in the midst of it. His temple, his altar, shall be set up and
attended there, and his institutions observed, and there then shall the
tokens of his special presence and favour be, which will be the glory in
the midst of them, will make them truly admirable in the eyes of all
about them. God will have honour from them, and put honour upon them.
Note, Those that have God for their God have him for their glory; those
that have him in the midst of them have glory in the midst of them, and
thence the church is said to be all glorious within. And those persons
and places that have God to be the glory in the midst of them have him
for a wall of fire round about them, for upon all that glory there is,
and shall be, a defence, [Isa 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md). Now
all this was fulfilled in part in Jerusalem, which in process of time
became a very flourishing city, and made a very great figure in those
parts of the world, much beyond what could have been expected,
considering how low it was brought and how long it was ere it recovered
itself; but it was to have its full accomplishment in the gospel-church,
which is extended far, as towns without walls, by the admission of the
Gentiles into it, and which has God, the Son of God, for its prince and
protector.

[Zechariah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 2:6</span></span>

One would have thought that Cyrus's proclamation, which gave liberty to
the captive Jews to return to their own land, would suffice to bring
them all back, and that, as when Pharaoh gave them leave to quit Egypt
and their house of bondage there, they would not leave a hoof behind;
but it seems it had not that effect. There were about 40,000 whose
spirits God stirred up to go, and they went; but many, perhaps the
greater part, staid behind. The land of their captivity was to most of
them the land of their nativity; they had taken root there, had gained a
settlement, and many of them a very comfortable one; some perhaps had
got estates and preferments there, and they did not think they could
better themselves by returning to their own land. Patria est ubicunque
bene est - My country is every spot where I feel myself happy. They had
no great affection to their own land, and apprehended the difficulties
in their way to it insuperable. This proceeded from a bad cause - a
distrust of the power and promise of God, a love of ease and worldly
wealth, and an indifference to the religion of their country and to the
God of Israel himself; and it had a bad effect, for it was a tacit
censure of those as foolish, rash, and given to change, that did return,
and a weakening of their hands in the work of God. Such as these could
not sing ([Psa 137:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001).md) in their
captivity, for they had forgotten thee, O Jerusalem! and were so far
from preferring thee before their chief joy that they preferred any joy
before thee. Here is therefore another proclamation issued out by the
God of Israel, strictly charging and commanding all his free-born
subjects, wherever they were dispersed, speedily to return into their
own land and render themselves at their respective posts there. They are
loudly summoned ([Zac 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#006).md): Ho! ho!
come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith the Lord. This
fitly follows upon the promise of the rebuilding and enlarging of
Jerusalem. If God will build it for them and their comfort, they must
come and inhabit it for him and his glory, and not continue sneaking in
Babylon. Note, The promises and privileges with which God's people are
blessed should engage us, whatever it cost us, to join ourselves to them
and cast in our lot among them. When Zion is enlarged, to make room for
all God's Israel, it is the greatest madness imaginable for any of them
to stay in Babylon. The captivity of a sinful state is by no means to be
continued in, though a man be ever so easy upon temporal accounts. No:
Come forth and flee with all speed, and lose no time. Escape for thy
life; look not behind thee. To induce them to hasten their return, let
them consider, 1. They are now dispersed, and are concerned to
incorporate themselves for their mutual common defence ([Zac
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#006).md): "I have spread you abroad as the
four winds of heaven, sent some into one corner of the world and some
into another; this has been your condition a long time, and therefore
you should now think of coming together again, to help one another." God
owns that his scattering them was in wrath, and therefore they must take
this invitation as a token of God's being willing to be reconciled to
them again, so that they kicked at his kindness in refusing to accept
the call. 2. They are now in bondage, and are concerned to assert their
own liberty; and therefore, "Deliver thyself, O Zion! flee from the
oppressor, and make the best of thy way. Let us see some such bold
efforts and struggles to help thyself as become the generous gracious
seed of Abraham." [Zac 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#007.md). Note, When
Christ has proclaimed that deliverance to the captives which he has
himself wrought out it then concerns each of us to deliver ourselves, to
loose ourselves from the bands of our necks ([Isa
52:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#002).md), and, since we are under grace,
to resolve that sin shall not have dominion over us, Zion herself is
here said to dwell with the daughter of Babylon, because many of the
precious sons of Zion dwelt there, and where the people of God are there
the church of God is, for it is not tied to places. Now it is not fit
that Zion should dwell with the daughter of Babylon; what communion can
light have with darkness? Zion will be in danger of partaking with the
daughter of Babylon both in her sins and in her plagues; and therefore,
"Come out of her, my people, [Rev
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004.md). Deliver thyself, O Zion! by a
speedy return to thy own land, and do not destroy thyself by continuing
in that polluted devoted land." Those that would be found among the
generation of God's children must save themselves from the untoward
generation of this world; it was St. Peter's charge to his new converts,
[Act 2:40](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#040.md). 3. They have seemed to be
forsaken and forgotten of God, but God will now make it to appear that
he espouses their cause and will plead it with jealousy, [Zac
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008.md), [Zac
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#009.md). It was a discouragement to those
who remained in Babylon to hear of the difficulties and oppositions
which their brethren met with that had returned, by which they were
still in danger of being crushed and overpowered. "And we might as well
sit still" (think they) "as rise up and fall." In answer to this
objection, the angel that talked with the prophet (that is, Jesus
Christ) tells him what he had commission to do for their protection and
the perfecting of their salvation, and herein he has an eye to the great
redemption which, in the fulness of time, he was to be the author of.
Christ, who is Jehovah, and the Lord of hosts, of all the hosts of
heaven and earth, in both which he has a sovereign power, says, He (that
is, the Father) has sent me. Note, What Jesus has done, and does, for
his church against his enemies, he was sent and commissioned by the
Father to do. With great satisfaction he often speaks of the Father that
sent him. (1.) He is sent after the glory. After the glorious beginning
of their deliverance he is sent to perfect it, for he is the finisher of
that work which he is the author of. Christ is sent, in the first place,
to the nation and people of the Jews, to whom pertained the glory, [Rom
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md). And he was himself the glory of
his people Israel. But after the glory, after his care of them, he is
sent to the nations, to be a light to lighten the Gentiles, by the power
of his gospel to captivate them, and bring them, and every high thought
among them, into obedience to himself. (2.) He is sent to the nations
that spoiled them, to take vengeance on them for the wrongs done to
Zion, when the year of his redeemed comes and the year of recompences
for the controversy of Zion, [Isa
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#008.md). He is sent to shake his hand
upon them, to lift up his mighty hand against them and to lay upon them
his heavy hand, to bruise them with a rod of iron and dash them in
pieces like a potter's vessel, [Psa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009.md). Some think it intimates how
easily God can subdue and humble them with the turn of his hand; it is
but shaking his hand over them and the work is done. They shall be a
spoil to their servants, shall be enslaved to those whom they had
enslaved, and be plundered by those whom they had plundered. In Esther's
time this was fulfilled, when the Jews had rule over those that hated
them ([Est 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#001).md), and often in the time
of the Maccabees. The promise is further fulfilled in Christ's victory
over our spiritual enemies, his spoiling principalities and powers and
making a show of them openly, [Col
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015.md). And it is still in force to the
gospel-church. Christ will reckon with all that are enemies to it, and
sooner or later will make them his footstool, [Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md); [Rev
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#009). (3..md) What he will do for his
church shall be an evident proof of God's tender care of it and
affection to it: He that touches you touches the apple of his eye. This
is a high expression of God's love to his church. By his resentment of
the injuries done to her it appears how dear she is to him, how he
interests himself in all her interests, and takes what is done against
her, not only as done against himself, but as done against the very
apple of his eye, the tenderest part, which nature has made very fine,
has put a double guard upon, and taught us to be in a special manner
careful of, and which the least touch is a great offence to. This
encourages the people of God to pray with David ([Psa
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008).md), Keep me as the apple of thy
eye; and engages them to do as Solomon directs ([Pro
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#002).md), to keep his law as the apple of
their eye. Some understand it thus: "He that touches you touches the
apple of his own eye; whoever do you any injury will prove, in the
issue, to have done the greatest injury to themselves." (4.) It shall be
an evident proof of Christ's mission: You shall know that the Lord of
hosts has sent me to be the protector of his church, that the promises
made to the church are yea and amen in him. Christ's victory over our
spiritual enemies proves that the Father sent him and was with him.

[Zechariah 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 2:10</span></span>

Here is, I. Joy proclaimed to the church of God, to the daughter of
Zion, that had separated herself from the daughter of Babylon. The Jews
that had returned were in distress and danger, their enemies in the
neighbourhood were spiteful against them, their friends that remained in
Babylon were cool towards them, shy of them, and declined coming in to
their assistance; and yet they are directed to sing, and to rejoice even
in tribulation. Note, Those that have recovered their purity, and
integrity, and spiritual liberty, though they have not yet recovered
their outward prosperity, have reason to sing and rejoice, to give glory
to God and take comfort to themselves.

I. God will have a people among them. If their brethren in Babylon will
not come to them, those of other nations shall, and shall replenish
Jerusalem and the cities of Judah: Many nations shall be joined to the
Lord in that day that are now at a distance from him and strangers to
him. The Jewish nation, after the captivity, multiplied very much, by
the accession of proselytes to it, that were naturalized, and were
entitled to all the privileges of native Israelites, and perhaps they
were equal in number; and therefore Paul mentions it as an honour to him
which many Jews had not, that he was of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew
of the Hebrews, [Phi 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005.md). And this was
an earnest of the bringing in of the Gentiles into the christian church
and in that this and other similar promises were to have their full
accomplishment. It was therefore strange that that should be so great an
offence to the Jews, as we find it was in the apostles' times, which was
promised them as a blessing in the prophets' times - that many nations
should be joined to the Lord. And, as there had been one law, so should
there be one gospel for the stranger and for those born in the land;
whatever nation they come from, when they join themselves to the Lord,
they shall be my people, as dear to God as ever Israel had been. Note,
God will own those for his people who with purpose of heart join
themselves to him; and, when many do so, we ought to look upon them, not
with a jealous eye, but with a joyful one. Angels rejoice, and therefore
so should the daughter of Zion, when many nations are joined to the
Lord.

II\. They shall have his presence among them: Sing and rejoice, for I
come. Those to whom God comes have reason to rejoice, for he will be to
them their chief joy. God will come, not to make them a visit only, but
to reside with them and preside over them: I will dwell in the midst of
thee ([Zac 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#010).md), and it is repeated
([Zac 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#011).md), because it was to have a
double accomplishment, 1. In the dedication of the temple, in their
regularly observing all God's institutions there and God's owning them
therein. Those have God dwelling in the midst of them that have his
ordinances administered in their purity, and a divine power going along
with them; with these tokens of God's presence the Jewish church was
blessed, after this, as much as ever. 2. In the incarnation of Christ.
He that here promises to dwell among them is that Lord whom the Lord of
hosts has sent ([Zac 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#011).md), and
therefore must be the Lord Jesus, who came and dwelt in the midst of the
Jewish nation, the eternal Word, that was made flesh, and dwelt among
us. This was the great honour reserved for that nation in its last days;
the promise of it effectually secured their continuance till it was
accomplished. They could not be destroyed while that blessing was in
them; and the prospect of it, according to the promise, was the great
support and comfort of those who looked for redemption in Jerusalem. It
is promised that when Christ comes and dwells among them they shall know
that the Lord of hosts has sent him; all that were Israelites indeed
were made to know it; sufficient proofs were given of it by the miracles
Christ wrought, so that they might have known it, and yet there were
those that perished in ignorance and unbelief, that would not know it,
for, if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of
glory.

III\. They shall have all their ancient dignities and privileges
restored to them again, [Zac 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#012.md). 1.
Canaan shall be a holy land again, not polluted by sin as it had been
formerly, not profaned by the enemies as it had been of late; it shall
be an enclosure again, and not laid in common. 2. Judah shall be in this
holy land, shall inhabit it, and enjoy the comfort of it, and no longer
be lost and scattered in Babylon. 3. Judah shall be God's portion, which
he will delight in, which shall be dear to him, by which he will be
served, and in which he will be glorified. The Lord's portion is his
people. 4. God will inherit Judah again as his portion, will claim his
interest, and recover the possession out of the hands of those that had
invaded his right. He will protect his people and govern them as a man
does his inheritance, and will be at home among them. 5. He will choose
Jerusalem again, as he had chosen it formerly, to put his name there; he
will renew and confirm the choice, and continue it a chosen place, till
it must resign its honours to the Jerusalem that is from above. Though
the election seemed to be set aside for a while, yet it shall obtain.

II\. Here is silence proclaimed to all the world besides, [Zac
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#013.md). The daughter of Zion must sing,
but all flesh must be silent. Observe here, 1. A very awful description
of God's appearances for the relief of his people. He is raised up out
of his holy habitation; as a man out of sleep ([Psa
44:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#023.md); [Psa
78:65](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#065).md), or as a man entering with
resolution upon a business that he will go through with. Heaven is his
holy habitation above; thence we must expect him to appear, [Isa
64:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md). His temple is so in this lower
world; thence from between the cherubim he will shine forth, [Psa
80:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001.md). He is about to do something
unusual, unexpected, and very surprising, and to plead his people's
cause, which had long seemed neglected. 2. A seasonable caution and
direction at such a time: Be silent, O all flesh! before the Lord -
before Christ and his grace (let not flesh object against the methods he
takes) - before God and his providence; the enemies of the church shall
be silenced; all iniquity shall stop her mouth. The friends of the
church also must be silent. Leave it to God to take his own way, and
neither prescribe to him what he should do nor quarrel with him whatever
he does. Be still, and know that he is God. Stand still, and see his
salvation. See [Hab 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#020.md); [Zep
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#007.md). Silently acquiesce in his holy
will, and patiently wait the issue, as those who are assured that when
God is raised up out of his holy habitation he will not retreat, nor sit
down again, till he has accomplished his whole work.
