### [Nahum Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001.md)

In this chapter we have, I. The inscription of the book, ([Nah
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001).md). II. A magnificent display of the
glory of God, in a mixture of wrath and justice against the wicked, and
mercy and grace towards his people, and the discovery of his majesty and
power in both ([Nah 1:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#002).md). III. A
particular application of this (as most interpreters think) to the
destruction of Sennacherib and the Assyrian army, when they besieged
Jerusalem, which was a very memorable and illustrious instance of the
power both of God's justice and of his mercy, and spoke abundance of
terror to his enemies and encouragement to his faithful servants ([Nah
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#009) -16.md).

[Nahum 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">nah 1:1</span></span>

This title directs us to consider, 1. The great city against which the
word of the Lord is here delivered; it is the burden of Nineveh, not
only a prophecy, and a weighty one, but a burdensome prophecy, a dead
weight to Nineveh, a mill-stone hanged about its neck. Nineveh was the
place concerned, and the Assyrian monarchy, which that was the royal
seat of. About 100 years before this Jonah had, in God's name, foretold
the speedy overthrow of this great city; but then the Ninevites repented
and were spared, and that decree did not bring forth. The Ninevites then
saw clearly how much it was to their advantage to turn from their evil
way; it was the saving of their city; and yet, soon after, they returned
to it again; it became worse than ever, a bloody city, and full of lies
and robbery. They repented of their repentance, returned with the dog to
his vomit, and at length grew worse than ever they had been. Then God
sent them not this prophet, as Jonah, but this prophecy, to read them
their doom, which was now irreversible. Note, The reprieve will not be
continued if the repentance be not continued in. If men turn from the
good they began to do, they can expect no other than that God should
turn from the favour he began to show, [Jer
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#010.md). 2. The poor prophet by whom the
word of the Lord is here delivered: It is the book of the vision of
Nahum the Elkoshite. The burden of Nineveh was what the prophet plainly
foresaw, for it was his vision, and what he left upon record (it is the
book of the vision), that, when he was gone, the event might be compared
with the prediction and might confirm it. All the account we have of the
prophet himself is that he was an Elkoshite, of the town called Elkes,
or Elcos, which, Jerome says, was in Galilee. Some observe that the
scripture ordinarily says little of the prophets themselves, that our
faith might not stand upon their authority, but upon that of the blessed
Spirit by whom their prophecies were indited.

[Nahum 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">nah 1:2</span></span>

Nineveh knows not God, that God that contends with her, and therefore is
here told what a God he is; and it is good for us all to mix faith with
that which is here said concerning him, which speaks a great deal of
terror to the wicked and comfort to good people; for this glorious
description of the Sovereign of the world, like the pillar of cloud and
fire, has a bright side towards Israel and a dark side towards the
Egyptians. Let each take his portion from it; let sinners read it and
tremble; let saints read it and triumph. The wrath of God is here
revealed from heaven against him enemies, his favour and mercy are here
assured to his faithful loyal subjects, and his almighty power in both,
making his wrath very terrible and his favour very desirable.

I. He is a God of inflexible justice, a jealous God, and will take
vengeance on his enemies; let Nineveh know this, and tremble before him.
Their idols are insignificant things; there is nothing formidable in
them. But the God of Israel is greatly to be feared; for, 1. He resents
the affronts and indignities done him by those that deny his being or
any of his perfections, that set up other gods in competition with him,
that destroy his laws, arraign his proceedings, ridicule his word, or
are abusive to his people. Let such know that Jehovah, the one only
living and true God, is a jealous God, and a revenger; he is jealous for
the comfort of his worshippers, jealous for his land ([Joe
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#018).md), and will not have that injured.
He is a revenger, and he is furious; he has fury (so the word is), not
as man has it, in whom it is an ungoverned passion (so he has said, Fury
is not in me, [Isa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#004).md), but he has
it in such a way as becomes the righteous God, to put an edge upon his
justice, and to make it appear more terrible to those who otherwise
would stand in no awe of it. He is Lord of anger (so the Hebrew phrase
is for that which we read, he is furious); he has anger, but he has it
at command and under government. Our anger is often lord over us, as
theirs that have no rule over their own spirits, but God is always Lord
of his anger and weighs a path to it, [Psa
78:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#050.md). 2. He resolves to reckon with
those that put those affronts upon him. We are told here, not only that
he is a revenger, but that he will take vengeance; he has said he will,
he has sworn it, [Deu 32:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#040.md), [Deu
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#041.md). Whoever are his adversaries and
enemies among men, he will make them feel his resentments; and, though
the sentence against his enemies is not executed speedily, yet he
reserves wrath for them and reserves them for it in the day of wrath.
Against his own people, who repent and humble themselves before him, he
keeps not his anger for ever, but against his enemies he will for ever
let out his anger. He will not at all acquit the wicked that sin, and
stand to it, and do not repent, [Nah
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#003.md). Those wickedly depart from their
God that depart, and never return ([Psa
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#021).md), and these he will not acquit.
Humble supplicants will find him gracious, but scornful beggars will not
find him easy, or that the door of mercy will be opened to a loud, but
late, Lord, Lord. This revelation of the wrath of God against his
enemies is applied to Nineveh ([Nah
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#008).md), and should be applied by all
those to themselves who go on still in their trespasses: With an
over-running flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof. The
army of the Chaldeans shall overrun the country of the Assyrians, and
lay it all waste. God's judgments, when they come with commission, are
like a deluge to any people, which they cannot keep off nor make head
against. Darkness shall pursue his enemies; terror and trouble shall
follow them, whitersoever they go, shall pursue them to utter darkness;
if they think to flee from the darkness which pursues them they will but
fall into that which is before them.

II\. He is a God of irresistible power, and is able to deal with his
enemies, be they ever so many, ever so mighty, ever so hardy. He is
great in power ([Nah 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#003).md), and
therefore it is good having him our friend and bad having him our enemy.
Now here,

1\. The power of God is asserted and proved by divers instances of it in
the kingdom of nature, where we always find its visible effects in the
ordinary course of nature, and sometimes in the surprising alterations
of that course. (1.) If we look up into the regions of the air, there we
shall find proofs of his power, for he has his ways in the whirlwind and
the storm. Which way soever God goes he carries a whirlwind and a storm
along with him, for the terror of his enemies, [Psa
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#009.md), etc. And, wherever there is a
whirlwind and a storm, God has the command of it, the control of it,
makes his way through it, goes on his way in it, and serves his own
purposes by it. He spoke to Job out of the whirlwind, and even stormy
winds fulfil his word. He has his way in the whirlwind, that is, he goes
on undiscerned, and the methods of his providence are to us
unaccountable; as it is said, His way is in the sea. The clouds are the
dust of his feet; he treads on them, walks on them, raises them when he
pleases, as a man with his feet raises a cloud of dust. It is but by
permission, or usurpation rather, that the devil is the prince of the
power of the air, for that power is in God's hand. (2.) If we cast our
eye upon the great deeps, there we find that the sea is his, for he made
it; for, when he pleases, he rebukes the sea and makes it dry, by drying
up all the rivers with which it is continually supplied. He gave those
proofs of his power when he divided the Red Sea and Jordan, and can do
the same again whenever he pleases. (3.) If we look round us on this
earth, we find proofs of his power, when, either by the extreme heat and
drought of summer or the cold and frost of winter, Bashan languishes,
and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languishes, the choicest and
strongest flower languishes. His power is often seen in earthquakes,
which shake the mountains ([Nah 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#005).md),
melt the hills, and melt them down, and level them with the plains. When
he pleases the earth is burnt at his presence by the scorching heat of
the sun, and he could burn it with fire from heaven, as he did Sodom,
and at the end of time he will burn the world and all that dwell
therein. The earth, and all the works that are therein, shall be burnt
up. Thus great is the Lord and of great power.

2\. This is particularly applied to his anger. If God be an almighty
God, we may thence infer ([Nah 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#006).md),
Who can stand before his indignation? The Ninevites had once found God
slow to anger (as he says [Nah 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#003).md),
and perhaps presumed upon the mercy they had then had experience of, and
thought they might make bold with him; but they will find he is just and
jealous as well as merciful and gracious, and, having shown the justice
of his wrath, in the next he shows the power of it, and the utter
insufficiency of his enemies to contend with him. It is in vain for the
stoutest and strongest of sinners to think to make their part good
against the power of God's anger. (1.) See God here as a consuming fire,
terrible and mighty. Here is his indignation against sin, and the
fierceness of his anger, his fury poured out, not like water, but like
fire, like the fire and brimstone rained on Sodom, [Psa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006.md). Hell is the fierceness of God's
anger, [Rev 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#019.md). God's anger is so
fierce that it beats down all before it: The rocks are thrown down by
him, which seemed immovable. Rocks have sometimes been rent by the
eruption of subterraneous fires, which is a faint resemblance of the
fierceness of God's anger against sinners whose hearts are rocky, for
none ever hardened their hearts against him and prospered. (2.) See
sinners here are stubble before the fire, weak and impotent, and a very
unequal match for the wrath of God. \[1.\] They are utterly unable to
bear up against it, so as to resist it, and put by the strokes of it:
Who can stand before his indignation? Not the proudest and most daring
sinner; not the world of the ungodly; no, not the angels that sinned.
\[2.\] They are utterly unable to bear up under it so as to keep up
their spirits, and preserve any enjoyment of themselves: Who can abide
in the fierceness of his anger? As it is irresistible, so it is
intolerable. Some of the effects of God's displeasure in this world a
man may bear up under, but the fierceness of his anger, when it fastens
immediately upon the soul, who can bear? Let us therefore fear before
him; let us stand in awe, and not sin.

III\. He is a God of infinite mercy; and in the midst of all this wrath
mercy is remembered. Let the sinners in Zion be afraid, that go on still
in their transgressions, but let not those that trust in God tremble
before him. For, 1. He is slow to anger ([Nah
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#003).md), not easily provoked, but ready
to show mercy to those who have offended him and to receive them into
favour upon their repentance. 2. When the tokens of his rage against the
wicked are abroad he takes care for the safety and comfort of his own
people ([Nah 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#007).md): The Lord is good to
those that are good, and to them he will be a stronghold in the day of
trouble. Note, The same almighty power that is exerted for the terror
and destruction of the wicked is engaged, and shall be employed, for the
protection and satisfaction of his own people; he is able both to save
and to destroy. In the day of public trouble, when God's judgments are
in the earth, laying all waste, he will be a place of defence to those
that by faith put themselves under his protection, those that trust in
him in the way of their duty, that live a life of dependence upon him,
and devotedness to him; he knows them, he owns them for his, he takes
cognizance of their case, knows what is best for them, and what course
to take most effectually for their relief. They are perhaps obscure and
little regarded in the world, but the Lord knows them, [Psa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006.md).

[Nahum 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">nah 1:9</span></span>

These verses seem to point at the destruction of the army of the
Assyrians under Sennacherib, which may well be reckoned a part of the
burden of Nineveh, the head city of the Assyrian empire, and a pledge of
the destruction of Nineveh itself about 100 years after; and this was an
event which Isaiah, with whom probably this prophet was contemporary,
spoke much of. Now observe here,

I. The great provocation which the Assyrians gave to God, the just and
jealous God, for which, though slow to anger, he would take vengeance
([Nah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#011).md): There is one come out of
thee, that imagines evil against the Lord - Sennacherib, and his
spokesman Rabshakeh. They framed an evil letter and an evil speech, not
only against Hezekiah and his people, but against God himself,
reflecting upon him as level with the gods of the heathen, and unable to
protect his worshippers, dissuading his people from putting confidence
in him, and urging them rather to put themselves under the protection of
the great king, the king of Assyria. They contrived to alter the
property of Jerusalem, that it should be no longer the city of the Lord,
the holy city. This one, this mighty one, so he thinks himself, that
comes out of Nineveh, imagining evil against the Lord, brings upon
Nineveh this burden. Never was the glorious Majesty of heaven and earth
more daringly, more blasphemously affronted than by Sennacherib at that
time. He was a wicked counsellor who counselled them to despair of God's
protection, and surrender themselves to the king of Assyria, and
endeavour to put them out of conceit with Hezekiah's reformation ([Isa
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#007).md); with this wicked counsellor he
here expostulates ([Nah 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#009).md): "What do
you imagine against the Lord? What a foolish wicked thing it is for you
to plot against God, as if you could outwit divine wisdom and overpower
omnipotence itself!" Note, There is a great deal imagined against the
Lord by the gates of hell, and against the interests of his kingdom in
the world; but it will prove a vain thing, [Psa
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md), [Psa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#002.md). He that sits in heaven laughs at
the imaginations of the pretenders to politics against him, and will
turn their counsels headlong.

II\. The great destruction which God would bring upon them for it, not
immediately upon the whole monarchy (the ruin of that was deferred till
the measure of their iniquity was full), but,

1\. Upon the army; God will make an utter end of that; it shall be
totally cut off and ruined at one blow; one fatal stroke of the
destroying angel shall lay them dead upon the spot; affliction shall not
rise up the second time, for it shall not need. With some sinners God
makes a quick despatch, does their business at once. Divine vengeance
goes not by one certain rule, nor in one constant track, but one way or
other, by acute diseases or chronical ones, by slow deaths or lingering
ones, he will make an utter end of all his enemies, who persist in their
imaginations against him. We have reason to think that the Assyrian army
were mostly of the same spirit, and spoke the same language, with their
general, and now God would take them to task, though they did but say as
they were taught; and it shall appear that they have laid themselves
open to divine wrath by their own act and deed, [Nah
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#010). (1..md) They are as thorns that
entangle one another, and are folded together. They make one another
worse, and more inveterate against God and his Israel, harden one
another's hearts, and strengthen one another's hands, in their impiety;
and therefore God will do with them as the husbandman does with a bush
of thorns when he cannot part them: he puts them all into the fire
together. (2.) They are as drunken men, intoxicated with pride and rage;
and such as they shall be irrecoverably overthrown and destroyed. They
shall be as drunkards, besotted to their own ruin, and shall stumble and
fall, and make themselves a reproach, and be justly laughed at. (3.)
They shall be devoured as stubble fully dry, which is irresistibly and
irrecoverably consumed by the flame. The judgments of God are as
devouring fire to those that make themselves as stubble to them. It is
again threatened concerning this great army ([Nah
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#012).md) that though they be quiet and
likewise many, very secure, not fearing the sallies out of the besieged
upon them, because they are numerous, yet thus shall they be cut down,
or certainly shall they be cut down, as grass and corn are cut down,
with as little ado, when he shall pass through, even the destroying
angel that is commissioned to cut them down. Note, The security of
sinners, and their confidence in their own strength, are often presages
of ruin approaching.

2\. Upon the king. He imagined evil against the Lord, and shall he
escape? No ([Nah 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#014).md): "The Lord has
given a commandment concerning thee; the decree has gone forth, that thy
name be no more sown, that thy memory perish, that thou be no more
talked of as thou hast been, and that the report of thy mighty actions
be dispersed upon the wings of fame and celebrated with her trumpet."
Because Sennacherib's son reigned in his stead, some make this to point
at the overthrow of the Assyrian empire not long after. Note, Those that
imagine evil against the Lord hasten evil upon themselves and their own
families and interests, and ruin their own names by dishonouring his
name. It is further threatened, (1.) That the images he worshipped
should be cut off from their temple, the graven image and the molten
image out of the house of his gods, which, some think, was fulfilled
when Sennacherib was slain by his two sons, as he was worshipping in the
house of Nisroch his god, by which barbarous parricide we may suppose
the temple was looked upon as defiled, and was therefore disused, and
the images were cut off from it, the worshippers of those images no
longer attending there. Or it may be taken more generally to denote the
utter ruin of Assyria; the army of the enemy shall lay all waste, and
not spare even the images of their gods, by which God would intimate to
them that one of the grounds of his controversy with them was their
idolatry. (2.) That Sennacherib's grave shall be made there, some think
in the house of his god; there he is slain, and there he shall be
buried, for he is vile; he lies under this perpetual mark of disgrace,
that he had so far lost his interest in the natural affection of his own
children that two of them murdered him. Or it may be meant of the
ignominious fall of the Assyrian monarchy itself, upon the ruins of
which that of Babylon was raised. What a noise was made about the grave
of that once formidable state, but now despicable, is largely described,
[Eze 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#003.md), [Eze
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#011.md), [Eze
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#015.md), [Eze
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#016.md). Note, Those that make
themselves vile by scandalous sins God will make vile by shameful
punishments.

III\. The great deliverance which God would hereby work for his own
people and the city that was called by his name. The ruin of the
church's enemies is the salvation of the church, and a very great
salvation it was that was wrought for Jerusalem by the overthrow of
Sennacherib's army.

1\. The siege shall hereby be raised: "Now will I break his yoke from
off thee, by which thou art kept in servitude, and will burst thy bonds
asunder, by which thou seemest bound over to the Assyrian's wrath." That
vast victorious army, when it forced free quarters for itself throughout
all the land of Judah, and lived at discretion there, was as yokes and
bonds upon them. Jerusalem, when it was besieged, was, as it were, bound
and fettered by it; but, when the destroying angel had done his work,
Jerusalem's bonds were burst asunder, and it was set at liberty again.
This was a figure of the great salvation, by which the Jerusalem that is
above is made free, is made free indeed.

2\. The enemy shall be so weakened and dispirited that they shall never
make any such attempt again, and the end of this trouble shall be so
well gained by the grace of God that there shall be no more occasion for
such a severe correction. (1.) God will not again afflict Jerusalem; his
anger is turned away, and he says, It is enough; for he has by this
fright accomplished his whole work upon Mount Zion ([Isa
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012).md), and therefore "though I have
afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more;" the bitter portion shall
not be repeated unless there be need and the patient's case call for it;
for God doth not afflict willingly. (2.) The enemy shall not dare again
to attack Jerusalem ([Nah 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015).md): The
wicked shall no more pass through thee as they have done, to lay all
waste, for he is utterly cut off and disabled to do it. His army is cut
off, his spirit cut off, and at length he himself is cut off.

3\. The tidings of this great deliverance shall be published and
welcomed with abundance of joy throughout the kingdom, [Nah
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015.md). While Sennacherib prevailed, and
carried all before him, every day brought bad news; but now, behold,
upon the mountains, the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, the feet
of the evangelist; he is seen coming at a distance upon the mountains,
as fast as his feet will carry him; and how pleasant a sight is it once
more to see a messenger of peace, after we have received so many of
Job's messengers! We find these words made use of by another prophet to
illustrate the mercy of the deliverance of the people of God out of
Babylon ([Isa 52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007).md), not that the
prophets stole the word one from another (as those did, [Jer
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#030).md), but speaking by the same
Spirit, they often used the same expressions; and it may be of good use
for ministers to testify their consent to wholesome truths ([Ti1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003).md) by concurring in the same forms
of sound words, [Ti2 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013.md). These words
are also quoted by the apostle, both from Isaiah and Nahum, and applied
to the great redemption wrought out for us by our Lord Jesus, and the
publishing of it to the world by the everlasting gospel, [Rom
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#015.md). Christ's ministers are those
messengers of good tidings, that preach peace by Jesus Christ. How
beautiful are the feet of those messengers! How welcome their message to
those that see their misery and danger by reason of sin! And observe, He
that brings these good tidings brings with them a call to Judah to keep
her solemn feasts and perform her vows. During the trouble, (1.) The
ordinary feasts had been intermitted. Inter arma silent leges - The
voice of law cannot be heard amidst the shouts of battle. While
Jerusalem was encompassed with armies they could not go thither to
worship; but now that the embargo is taken off they must return to the
observance of their feasts; and the feasts of the Lord will be doubly
sweet to the people of God when they have been for some time deprived of
the benefit of them and God graciously restores them their opportunities
again, for we are taught the worth of such mercies by the want of them.
(2.) They had made vows to God, that, if he would deliver them out of
this distress, they would do something extraordinary in his service, to
his honour; and now that the deliverance is wrought they are called upon
to perform their vows; the promise they had then made must now be made
good, for better it is not to vow than to vow and not to pay. And those
words, The wicked shall no more pass through thee, may be taken as a
promise of the perfecting of the good work of reformation which Hezekiah
had begun; the wicked shall not, as they have done, walk on every side,
but they shall be cut off, and the baffling of the attempts from the
wicked enemies abroad is a mercy indeed to a nation when it is
accompanied with the restraint and reformation of the wicked at home,
who are its more dangerous enemies.
