### [Ezekiel Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 37:0</span></span>

The threatenings of the destruction of Judah and Jerusalem for their
sins, which we had in the former part of this book, were not so
terrible, but the promises of their restoration and deliverance for the
glory of God, which we have here in the latter part of the book, are as
comfortable; and as those were illustrated with many visions and
similitudes, for the awakening of a holy fear, so are these, for the
encouraging of a humble faith. God had assured them, in the foregoing
chapter, that he would gather the house of Israel, even all of it, and
would bring them out of their captivity, and return them to their own
land; but there were two things that rendered this very unlikely: - I.
That they were so dispersed among their enemies, so destitute of all
helps and advantages which might favour or further their return, and so
dispirited likewise in their own minds; upon all these accounts they are
here, in vision, compared to a valley full of the dry bones of dead men,
which should be brought together and raised to life. The vision of this
we have ([Eze 37:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001).md) and the
explication of it, with its application to the present case ([Eze
37:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011).md). II. That they were so
divided among themselves, too much of the old enmity between Judah and
Ephriam remaining even in their captivity. But, as to this, by a sign of
two sticks made one in the hand of the prophet is foreshown the happy
coalition that should be, at their return, between the two nations of
Israel and Judah ([Eze 37:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#015).md). In
this there was a type of the uniting of Jews and Gentiles, Jews and
Samaritans, in Christ and his church. And so the prophet slides into a
prediction of the kingdom of Christ, which should be set up in the world
with God's tabernacle in it, and of the glories and graces of that
kingdom ([Eze 37:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#023).md).

[Ezekiel 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 37:1</span></span>

Here is, I. The vision of a resurrection from death to life, and it is a
glorious resurrection. This is a thing so utterly unknown to nature, and
so contrary to its principles (a privatione ad habitum non datur
regressus - from privation to possession there is no return), that we
could have no thought of it but by the word of the Lord; and that it is
certain by that word that there shall be a general resurrection of the
dead some have urged from this vision, "For" (say they) "otherwise it
would not properly be made a sign for the confirming of their faith in
the promise of their deliverance out of Babylon, as the coming of the
Messiah is mentioned for the confirming of their faith touching a former
deliverance," [Isa 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md). But,

1\. Whether it be a confirmation or no, it is without doubt a most
lively representation of a threefold resurrection, besides that which it
is primarily intended to be the sign of. (1.) The resurrection of souls
from the death of sin to the life or righteousness, to a holy, heavenly,
spiritual, and divine life, by the power of divine grace going along
with the word of Christ, [Joh 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024.md),
[Joh 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025). (2..md) The resurrection of
the gospel church, or any part of it, from an afflicted persecuted
state, especially under the yoke of the New Testament Babylon, to
liberty and peace. (3.) The resurrection of the body at the great day,
especially the bodies of believers that shall rise to life eternal.

2\. Let us observe the particulars of this vision.

(1.) The deplorable condition of these dead bones. The prophet was made,
\[1.\] to take an exact view of them. By a prophetic impulse and a
divine power he was, in vision, carried out and set in the midst of a
valley, probably that plain spoken of [Eze
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022.md), where God then talked with him;
and it was full of bones, of dead men's bones, not piled up on a heap,
as in a charnel-house, but scattered upon the face of the ground, as if
some bloody battle had been fought here, and the slain left unburied
till all the flesh was devoured or putrefied, and nothing left but the
bones, and those disjointed from one another and dispersed. He passed by
them round about, and he observed not only that they were very many (for
there are multitudes gone to the congregation of the dead), but that,
lo, they were very dry, having been long exposed to the sun and wind.
The bones that have been moistened with marrow ([Job
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#024).md), when they have been any while
dead, lose all their moisture, and are dry as dust. The body is now
fenced with bones ([Job 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#011).md), but
then they will themselves be defenceless. The Jews in Babylon were like
those dead and dry bones, unlikely ever to come together, to be so much
as a skeleton, less likely to be formed into a body, and least of all to
be a living body. However, they lay unburied in the open valley, which
encouraged the hopes of their resurrection, as of the two witnesses,
[Rev 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008.md), [Rev
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#009.md). The bones of Gog and Magog shall
be buried ([Eze 39:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#012.md), [Eze
39:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#015).md), for their destruction is
final; but the bones of Israel are in the open valley, under the eye of
Heaven, for there is hope in their end. \[2.\] He was made to own their
case deplorable, and not to be helped by any power less than that of God
himself ([Eze 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#003).md): "Son of man, can
these bones live? Is it a thing likely? Cast thou devise how it should
be done? Can thy philosophy reach to put life into dry bones, or thy
politics to restore a captive nation?" "No," says the prophet, "I know
not how it should be done, but thou knowest." He does not say, "They
cannot live," lest he should seem to limit the Holy One of Israel; but,
"Lord, thou knowest whether they can and whether they shall; if thou
dost not put life into them, it is certain that they cannot life." Note,
God is perfectly acquainted with his own power and his own purposes, and
will have us to refer all to them, and to see and own that his wondrous
works are such as could not be effected by any counsel or power but his
own.

(2.) The means used for the bringing of these dispersed bones together
and these dead and dry bones to life. It must be done by prophecy.
Ezekiel is ordered to prophesy upon these bones ([Eze
37:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#004.md) and again [Eze
37:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#009).md), to prophesy to the wind. So he
prophesied as he was commanded, [Eze
37:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#007.md), [Eze
37:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#010.md). \[1.\] He must preach, and he
did so; and the dead bones lived by a power that went along with the
word of God which he preached. \[2.\] He must pray, and he did so; and
the dead bones were made to live in answer to prayer; for a spirit of
life entered into them. See the efficacy of the word and prayer, and the
necessity of both, for the raising of dead souls. God bids his ministers
prophesy upon the dry bones. Say unto them, Live; yea, say unto them,
Live; and they do as they are commanded, calling to them again and
again, O you dry bones! hear the word of the Lord. But we call in vain,
still they are dead, still they are very dry; we must therefore be
earnest with God in prayer for the working of the Spirit with the word:
Come, O breath! and breathe upon them. God's grace can save souls
without our preaching, but our preaching cannot save them without God's
grace, and that grace must be sought by prayer. Note, Ministers must
faithfully and diligently use the means of grace, even with those that
there seems little probability of gaining upon. To prophesy upon dry
bones seems as great a penance as to water a dry stick; and yet, whether
they will hear or forbear, we must discharge our trust, must prophesy as
we are commanded, in the name of him who raises the dead and is the
fountain of life.

(3.) The wonderful effect of these means. Those that do as they are
commanded, as they are commissioned, in the face of the greatest
discouragements, need not doubt of success, for God will own and enrich
his own appointments. \[1.\] Ezekiel looked down and prophesied upon the
bones in the valley, and they became human bodies. First, That which he
had to say to them was that God would infallibly raise them to life:
Thus saith the Lord God unto these bones, You shall live, [Eze
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#005.md) and again [Eze
37:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#006.md). And he that speaks the word will
thereby do the work; he that says, They shall live, will make them
alive: He will clothe them with skin and flesh ([Eze
37:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#006).md), as he did at first, [Job
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#011.md). He that made us so fearfully
and wonderfully, and curiously wrought us, can in like manner new-make
us, for his arm is not shortened. Secondly, That which was immediately
done for them was that they were moulded anew into shape. We may well
suppose it was with great liveliness and vigour that the prophet
prophesied, especially when he found what he said begin to take effect.
Note, The opening, sealing, and applying of the promises, are the
ordinary means of our participation of a new and divine nature. As
Ezekiel prophesied in this vision there was a noise, a word of command,
from heaven, seconding what he said; or it signified the motion of the
angels that were to be employed as the ministers of the divine
Providence in the deliverance of the Jews, and we read of the noise of
their wings ([Eze 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#024).md) and the sound
of their going, [Sa2 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#024.md). And,
behold, a shaking, or commotion, among the bones. Even dead and dry
bones begin to move when they are called to hear the word of the Lord.
This was fulfilled when, upon Cyrus's proclamation of liberty, those
whose spirits God had stirred up began to think of making use of that
liberty, and getting ready to be gone. When there was a noise, behold, a
shaking; when David heard the sound of the going on the tops of the
mulberry-trees then he bestirred himself; then there was a shaking. When
Paul heard the voice saying, Why persecutest thou me? behold, a shaking
of the dry bones; he trembled and was astonished. But this was not all:
The bones came together bone to his bone, under a divine direction; and,
though there is in man a multitude of bones, yet of all the bones of
those numerous slain not one was missing, not one missed its way, not
one missed its place, but, as it were by instinct, each knew and found
its fellow. The dispersed bones came together and the displaced bones
were knit together, the divine power supplying that to these dry bones
which in a living body every joint supplies. Thus shall it be in the
resurrection of the dead; the scattered atoms shall be ranged and
marshalled in their proper place and order, and every bone come to his
bone, by the same wisdom and power by which the bones were first formed
in the womb of her that is with child. Thus it was in the return of the
Jews; those that were scattered in several parts of the province of
Babylon came to their respective families, and all as it were by consent
to the general rendezvous, in order to their return. By degrees sinews
and flesh came upon these bones, and the skin covered them, [Eze
37:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#008.md). This was fulfilled when the
captives got their effects about them, and the men of their place helped
them with silver, and gold, and whatever they needed for their remove,
[Ezr 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#004.md). But still there was no
breath in them; they wanted spirit and courage for such a difficult and
hazardous enterprise as this was of returning to their own land. \[2.\]
Ezekiel then looked up and prophesied to the wind, or breath, or spirit,
and said, Come, O breath! and breathe upon these slain. As good have
been still dry bones as dead bodies: but as for God his work is perfect;
he is not the God of the dead, but of the living; therefore breathe upon
them that they may live. In answer to this request, the breath
immediately came into them, [Eze
37:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#010.md). Note, the spirit of life is
from God; he at first in the creation breathed into man the breath of
life, and so he will at last in the resurrection. The dispirited
despairing captives were wonderfully animated with resolution to break
through all the discouragements that lay in the way of their return and
applied themselves to it with all imaginable vigour. And then they stood
upon their feet, an exceedingly great army; not only living men, but
effective men, fit for service in the wars and formidable to all that
gave them any opposition. Note, With God nothing is impossible. He can
out of stones raise up children unto Abraham and out of dead and dry
bones levy an exceedingly great army to fight his battles and plead his
cause.

II\. The application of this vision to the present calamitous condition
of the Jews in captivity: These bones are the whole house of Israel,
both the ten tribes and the two. See in this what they are and what they
shall be.

1\. The depth of despair to which they are now reduced, [Eze
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011.md). They all give up themselves for
lost and gone; they say, "Our bones are dried, our strength is
exhausted, our spirits are gone, our hope is all lost; every thing we
looked for succour and relief from fails us, and we are cut off for our
parts. Let who will cherish some hope, we see no ground for any." Note,
When troubles continue long, hopes have been often frustrated, and all
creature-confidences fail, it is not strange if the spirits sink; and
nothing but an active faith in the power, promise, and providence of God
will keep them from quite dying away. 2. The height of prosperity to
which, notwithstanding this, they shall be advanced: "therefore, because
things have come thus to the last extremity, prophesy to them, and tell
them, now is God's time to appear for them. Jehovah-jireh - in the mount
of the Lord it shall be seen, [Eze
37:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#012). Tell them," (1..md) "That they
shall be brought out of the land of their enemies, where they are as it
were buried alive: I will open your graves." Those shall be restored,
not only whose bones are scattered at the grave's mouth ([Psa
141:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#007).md), but who are buried in the
grave; though the power of the enemy is like the bars of the pit, which
one would think it impossible to break through, strong as death and
cruel as the grave, yet it shall be conquered. God can bring his people
up from the depths of the earth, [Psa
71:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#020). (2..md) "That they shall be
brought into their own land, where they shall live in prosperity: I will
bring you into the land of Israel ([Eze
37:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#012).md) and place you there ([Eze
37:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#014).md), and will put my spirit in you
and then you shall live." Note, Then God puts spirit in us to good
purpose, and so that we shall indeed live, when he puts his Spirit in
us. And (lastly) in all this God will be glorified: You shall know that
I am the Lord ([Eze 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#013).md), and that I
have spoken it and performed it, [Eze
37:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#014.md). Note, God's quickening the dead
redounds more than any thing to his honour, and to the honour of his
word, which he has magnified above all his name, and will magnify more
and more by the punctual accomplishment of every tittle of it.

[Ezekiel 37:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 37:15</span></span>

Here are more exceedingly great and precious promises made of the happy
state of the Jews after their return to their own land; but they have a
further reference to the kingdom of the Messiah and the glories of
gospel-times.

I. It is here promised that Ephraim and Judah shall be happily united in
brotherly love and mutual serviceableness; so that whereas, ever since
the desertion of the ten tribes from the house of David under Jeroboam,
there had been continual feuds and animosities between the two kingdoms
of Israel and Judah, and it is to be feared there had been some
clashings between them even in the land of their captivity (Ephraim upon
all occasions envying Judah and Judah vexing Ephraim), now it should be
no longer, but there should be a coalition between them, and,
notwithstanding the old differences that had been between them, they
should agree to love one another and to do one another all good offices.
This is here illustrated by a sign. The prophet was to take two sticks,
and write upon one, For Judah (including Benjamin, those of the children
of Israel that were his companions), upon the other, For Joseph,
including the rest of the tribes, [Eze
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#016.md). These two sticks must be so
framed as to fall into one in his hand, [Eze
37:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#017.md). The people took notice of this,
and desired him to tell them the meaning of it, for they knew he did not
play with sticks for his diversion, as children do. Those that would
know the meaning should ask the meaning of the word of God which they
read and hear, and of the instituted signs by which spiritual and divine
things are represented to us; the ministers' lips should keep the
knowledge hereof and the people should ask it at their mouth, [Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007.md). It is a necessary question for
grown people, as well as children, to ask, What mean you by this
service, by this sign? [Exo 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#026.md). The
meaning was that Judah and Israel should become one in the hand of God,
[Eze 37:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#019.md). 1. They shall be one, one
nation, [Eze 37:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#022.md). They shall have no
separate interests, and, consequently, no divided affections. There
shall be no mutual jealousies and animosities, no remembrance, no
remains, of their former discord. But there shall be a perfect harmony
between them, a good understanding one of another, a good disposition
one to another, and a readiness to all good offices and services for one
another's credit and comfort. They had been two sticks crossing and
thwarting one another, nay, beating and bruising one another; but now
they shall become one, supporting and strengthening one another. Vix
unita fortior - Force added to force is proportionally more efficient.
Behold, how good and how pleasant a thing it is to see Judah and Israel,
that had long been at variance, now dwelling together in unity. Then
they shall become acceptable to their God, amiable to their friends, and
formidable to their enemies, [Isa
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#013.md), [Isa
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#014.md). 2. They shall be one in God's
hand; by his power they shall be united, and, being by his hand brought
together, his hand shall keep them together, so that they shall not fly
off, to be separated again. They shall be one in his hand, for his glory
shall be the centre of their unity and his grace the cement of it. In
him, in a regard to him and in his service and worship, they shall
unite, and so shall become one. Both sides shall agree to put themselves
into his hand, and so they shall be one. Qui conveniunt in aliquo tertio
inter se conveniunt - Those who agree in a third agree with each other.
Note, Those are best united that are one in God's hand, whose union with
each other results from their union with Christ and their communion with
God through him, [Eph 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010.md). One in us,
[Joh 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021.md). 3. They shall be one in
their return out of captivity ([Eze
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#021).md): I will take them from among
the heathen, and gather them on every side, and bring them together
incorporated into one body to their own land. They shall be one in their
separation from the heathen with whom they had mingled themselves: they
shall both agree to part from them, and take their affections off from
them, and no longer to comply with their usages, and then they will soon
agree to join together in walking according to the rule of God's word.
Their having been joint-sufferers will contribute to this blessed
comprehension, when they begin to come to themselves and to consider
things. Put many pieces of metal together into the furnace, and, when
they are melted, they will run all together. It was time for them to
strengthen one another when their oppressors were so busy to weaken and
ruin them all. Likewise their being joint-sharers in the favour of God,
and the great and common deliverance wrought out for them all, should
help to unite them. God's loving them all was a good reason why they
should love one another. Times of common joy, as well as times of common
suffering, should be healing loving times. 4. They shall all be the
subjects of one king, and so they shall become one. The Jews, after
their return, were under one government, and not divided as formerly.
But this certainly looks further, to the kingdom of Christ; he is that
one King in allegiance to whom all God's spiritual Israel shall
cheerfully unite, and under whose protection they shall all be gathered.
All believers unite in one Lord, one faith, and one baptism. And the
uniting of Jews and Gentiles in the gospel church, their becoming one
fold under Christ the one great Shepherd, is doubtless the union that is
chiefly looked at in this prophecy. By Christ and partition-wall between
them was taken down, and the enmity slain, and of them twain was made
one new man, [Eph 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014.md), [Eph
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015.md).

II\. It is here promised that the Jews shall by their captivity be cured
of their inclination to idolatry; this shall be the happy fruit of that
affliction, even the taking away of their sin ([Eze
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#023).md): Neither shall they defile
themselves any more with their idols, those detestable defiling things,
no, nor with any of their former transgressions. Note, When one sin is
sincerely parted with all sin is abandoned too, for he that hates sin,
as sin, will hate all sin. And those that are cured of their spiritual
idolatry, their inordinate affection to the world and the flesh, that no
longer make a god of their money or their belly, have a happy blow given
to the root of all their transgressions. Two ways God will take to cure
them of their idolatry: - 1. By bringing them out of the way of
temptation to it: "I will save them out of all their dwelling-places
wherein they have sinned, because there they met with the occasion of
sin and allurements to it." Note, It is our wisdom to avoid the places
where we have been overcome by temptations to sin, not to remain in
them, or return to them, but to save ourselves out of them, as we would
out of infected places; see [Zac 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#007.md);
[Rev 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004.md). And it is a great mercy
when God, in his providence, saves us out of the dwelling-places where
we have sinned, and keeps us from harm by keeping us out of harm's way,
in answer to our prayer, Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us
from evil. 2. By changing the disposition of their mind: "I will cleanse
them ([Eze 37:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#028).md); that is, I will
sanctify them, will work in them an aversion to the pollutions of sin
and a complacency in the pleasures of holiness, and then you may be sure
they will not defile themselves any more with their idols." Those whom
God has cleansed he will keep clean.

III\. It is here promised that they shall be the people of God, as their
God, and the subjects and sheep of Christ their King and Shepherd. These
promises we had before, and they are here repeated ([Eze
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#023.md), [Eze
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024).md) for the encouragement of the
faith of Israel: They shall be my people, to serve me, and I will be
their God, to save them and to make them happy. David, my servant, shall
be king over them, to fight their battles, to protect them from injury,
and to rule them, and overrule all things that concern them for their
good. He shall be their shepherd, to guide them and provide for them.
Christ is this David, Israel's King of old; and those whom he subdues to
himself, and makes willing in the day of his power, he makes to walk in
his judgments and to keep his statutes.

IV\. It is here promised that they shall dwell comfortably, [Eze
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#025.md), [Eze
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#026.md). They shall dwell in the land of
Israel; for where else should Israelites dwell? And many things will
concur to make their dwelling agreeable. 1. They shall have it by
covenant; they shall come in again upon their old title, by virtue of
the grant made unto Jacob, God's servant. As Christ was David, God's
servant, so the church is Jacob, his servant too; and the members of the
church shall come in for a share, as born in God's house. He will make a
covenant of peace with them ([Eze
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#026).md), and in pursuance of that
covenant he will place them, and multiply them. Note, Temporal mercies
are doubly sweet when they come from the promise of the covenant, and
not merely from common providence. 2. They shall come to it by
prescription: "It is the land wherein your fathers have dwelt, and for
that reason you cannot but have a special kindness for it, which God
will graciously gratify." It was the inheritance of their ancestors, and
therefore shall be theirs. They are beloved for their fathers' sakes. 3.
They shall have it entailed upon them and the heirs of their body, and
shall have their families built up, so that it shall not be lost for
want of heirs. They shall dwell therein all their time, and never be
turned out of possession, and they shall leave it for an inheritance to
their children and their children's children for ever, who shall enjoy
it when they are gone, the prospect of which will be a satisfaction to
them. 4. They shall live under a good government, which will contribute
very much to the comfort of their lives: My servant David shall be their
prince for ever. This can be no other than Christ, of whom it was said,
when he was brought into the world, He shall reign over the house of
Jacob for ever, [Luk 1:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#033.md). Note, It is
the unspeakable comfort of all Christ's faithful subjects that, as his
kingdom is everlasting, so he is an everlasting King, he lives to reign
for ever; and, as sure and as long as he lives and reigns, they shall
live and reign also. 5. The charter by which they hold all their
privileges is indefeasible. God's covenant with them shall be an
everlasting covenant; so the covenant of grace is, for it secures to us
an everlasting happiness.

V. It is here promised that God will dwell among them; and this will
make them dwell comfortably indeed: I will set my sanctuary in the midst
of them for evermore; my tabernacle also shall be with them, [Eze
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#026.md), [Eze
37:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#027.md). 1. They shall have the tokens
of God's special presence with them and his gracious residence among
them. God will in very deed dwell with them upon the earth, for where
his sanctuary is he is; when they profaned his sanctuary he took it from
them ([Isa 64:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#011).md), but now that they
are purified God will dwell with them again. 2. They shall have
opportunity of conversing with God, of hearing from him, speaking to
him, and so keeping up communion with him, which will be the comfort of
their lives. 3. They shall have the means of grace. By the oracles of
God in his tabernacle they shall be made wiser and better, and all their
children shall be taught of the Lord. 4. Thus their covenant relation to
God shall be improved and the bond of it strengthened: "I will be their
God and they shall be my people, and they shall know it by having my
sanctuary among them, and shall have the comfort of it."

VI\. Both God and Israel shall have the honour of this among the
heathen, [Eze 37:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#026.md). "Now the heathen
observe how Israel have profaned their own crown by their sins, and God
has profaned it by his judgments; but then, when Israel is reformed and
God has returned in mercy to them, the very heathen shall be made to
know that the Lord sanctifies Israel, has a title to them and an
interest in them more than other people, because his sanctuary is, and
shall be, in the midst of them." Note, God designs the sanctification of
those among whom he sets up his sanctuary. And blessed and holy are
those who, enjoying the privileges of the sanctuary, give such proofs
and evidences of their sanctification that the heathen may know it is no
less than the almighty grace of God that sanctifies them. Such have
God's sanctuary in the midst of them, the kingdom of God within them, in
the principles of the spiritual life, and shall have it so for evermore
in the enjoyments of an eternal life.
