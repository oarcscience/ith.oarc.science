### [Ezekiel Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 42:0</span></span>

This chapter continues and concludes the describing and measuring of
this mystical temple, which it is very hard to understand the particular
architecture of, and yet more hard to comprehend the mystical meaning
of. Here is, I. A description of the chambers that were about the
courts, their situation and structure ([Eze
42:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001).md), and the uses for which they
were designed ([Eze 42:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#013.md), [Eze
42:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#014).md). II. A survey of the whole
compass of ground which was taken up with the house, and the courts
belonging to it ([Eze 42:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#015).md).

[Ezekiel 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 42:1</span></span>

The prophet has taken a very exact view of the temple and the buildings
belonging to it, and is now brought again into the outer court, to
observe the chambers that were in that square.

I. Here is a description of these chambers, which (as that which went
before) seems to us very perplexed and intricate, through our
unacquaintedness with the Hebrew language and the rules of architecture
at that time. We shall only observe, in general, 1. That about the
temple, which was the place of public worship, there were private
chambers, to teach us that our attendance upon God in solemn ordinances
will not excuse us from the duties of the closet. We must not only
worship in the courts of God's house, but must, both before and after
our attendance there, enter into our chambers, enter into our closets,
and read and meditate, and pray to our Father in secret; and a great
deal of comfort the people of God have found in their communion with God
in solitude. 2. That these chambers were many; there were three stories
of them, and, though the higher stories were not so large as the lower,
yet they served as well for retirement, [Eze
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#005.md), [Eze
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#006.md). There were many, that there
might be conveniences for all such devout people as Anna the prophetess,
who departed not from the temple night or day, [Luk
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#037.md). In my Father's house are many
mansions. In his house on earth there are so; multitudes by faith have
taken lodgings in his sanctuary, and yet there is room. 3. That these
chambers, though they were private, yet were near the temple, within
view of it, within reach of it, to teach us to prefer public worship
before private (the Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all the
dwellings of Jacob, and so must we), and to refer our private worship to
the public. Our religious performances in our chambers must be to
prepare us for the exercises of devotion in public, and to further us in
our improvement of them, as our opportunities are. 4. That before these
chambers there were walks of five yards broad ([Eze
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#004).md), in which those that had
lodgings in these chambers might meet for conversation, might walk and
talk together for their mutual edification, might communicate their
knowledge and experiences. For we are not to spend all our time between
the church and the chamber, though a great deal of time may be spent to
very good purpose in both. But man is made for society, and Christians
for the communion of saints; and the duties of that communion we must
make conscience of, and the privileges and pleasures of that communion
we must take the comfort of. It is promised to Joshua, who was high
priest in the second temple, that God will give him places to walk in
among those that stand by, [Zac 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#007.md).

II\. Here is the use of these chambers appointed, [Eze
42:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#013.md), [Eze
42:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#014.md). 1. They were for the priests
that approach unto the Lord, that they may be always near their business
and may not be non-residents. Therefore they are called holy chambers,
because they were for use of those that ministered in holy things during
their ministration. Those that have public work to do for God and the
souls of men have need to be much in private, to fit themselves for it.
Ministers should spend much time in their chambers, in reading,
meditation, and prayer, that their profiting may appear; and they ought
to be provided with conveniences for this purpose. 2. There the priests
were to deposit the most holy things, those parts of the offerings which
fell to their share; and there they were to eat them, they and their
families, in a religious manner, for the place is holy; and thus they
must make a difference between those feasts upon the sacrifice and other
meals. 3. There (among other uses) they were to lay their vestments,
which God had appointed them to wear when they ministered at the altar,
their linen ephods, coats, girdles, and bonnets. We read of the
providing of priests garments after their return out of captivity, [Neh
7:70](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#070.md), [Neh
7:72](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#072.md). When they had ended their
service at the altar they must lay by those garments, to signify that
the use of them should continue only during that dispensation; but they
must put on other garments, such as other people wear, when they
approached to those things which were for the people, that is, to do
that part of their service which related to the people, to teach them
the law and to answer their enquiries. Their holy garments must be laid
up, that they may be kept clean and decent for the credit of their
service.

[Ezekiel 42:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#015.md)

We have attended the measuring of this mystical temple and are now to
see how far the holy ground on which we tread extends; and that also is
here measured, and found to take in a great compass. Observe, 1. What
the dimensions of it were. It extended each way 500 reeds ([Eze
42:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#016).md), each reed above three yards
and a half, so that it reached every way about an English measured mile,
which, the ground lying square, was above four miles round. Thus large
were the suburbs (as I may call them) of this mystical temple,
signifying the great extent of the church in gospel-times, when all
nations should be discipled and the kingdoms of the world made Christ's
kingdoms. Room should be made in God's courts for the numerous forces of
the Gentiles that shall flow into them, as was foretold, [Isa
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#018.md); [Isa
60:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#004.md). It is in part fulfilled already
in the accession of the Gentiles to the church; and we trust it shall
have a more full accomplishment when the fulness of the Gentiles shall
come in and all Israel shall be saved. 2. Why the dimensions of it were
made thus large. It was to make a separation, by putting a very large
distance between the sanctuary and the profane place; and therefore
there was a wall surrounding it, to keep off those that were unclean and
to separate between the previous and the vile. Note, A difference is to
be put between common and sacred things, between God's name and other
names, between his day and other days, his book and other books, his
institutions and other observances; and a distance is to be put between
our worldly and religious actions, so as still to go about the worship
of God with a solemn pause.
