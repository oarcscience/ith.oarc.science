### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 16:0</span></span>

At this chapter begins the story of David, one that makes as great a
figure in the sacred story as almost any of the worthies of the Old
Testament, one that both with his sword and with his pen served the
honour of God and the interests of Israel as much as most ever did, and
was as illustrious a type of Christ. Here I. Samuel is appointed and
commissioned to anoint a king among the sons of Jesse at Bethlehem ([Sa1
16:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001).md). II. All his elder sons are
passed by and David the youngest is pitched upon and anointed ([Sa1
16:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#006).md). III. Saul growing
melancholy, David is pitched upon to relieve him by music ([Sa1
16:14-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#014).md). Thus small are the
beginnings of that great man.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 16:1</span></span>

Samuel had retired to his own house in Ramah, with a resolution not to
appear any more in public business, but to addict himself wholly to the
instructing and training up of the sons of the prophets, over whom he
presided, as we find, [Sa1 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#020.md). He
promised himself more satisfaction in young prophets than in young
princes; and we do not find that, to his dying day, God called him out
to any public action relating to the state, but only here to anoint
David.

I. God reproves him for continuing so long to mourn for the rejection of
Saul. He does not blame him for mourning on that occasion, but for
exceeding in his sorrow: How long wilt thou mourn for Saul? [Sa1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001.md). We do not find here that he
mourned at all for the setting aside of his own family and the deposing
of his own sons; but for the rejecting of Saul and his seed he mourns
without measure, for the former was done by the people's foolish
discontent, this by the righteous wrath of God. Yet he must find time to
recover himself, and not go mourning to his grave, 1. Because God has
rejected him, and he ought to acquiesce in the divine justice, and
forget his affection to Saul; if God will be glorified in his ruin,
Samuel ought to be satisfied. Besides, to what purpose should he weep?
The decree has gone forth, and all his prayers and tears cannot prevail
for the reversing of it, [Sa2 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#022.md),
[Sa2 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#023.md). 2. Because Israel shall be
no loser by it, and Samuel must prefer the public welfare before his own
private affection to his friend. "Mourn not for Saul, for I have
provided me a king. The people provided themselves a king and he proved
bad, now I will provide myself one, a man after my own heart." See [Psa
89:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#020.md); [Act
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#022.md). "If Saul be rejected, yet
Israel shall not be as sheep having no shepherd. I have another in store
for them; let thy joy of him swallow up thy grief for the rejected
prince."

II\. He sends him to Bethlehem, to anoint one of the sons of Jesse, a
person probably not unknown to Samuel. Fill thy horn with oil. Saul was
anointed with a glass vial of oil, scanty and brittle, David with a horn
of oil, which was more plentiful and durable; hence we read of a horn of
salvation in the house of his servant David, [Luk
1:69](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#069.md).

III\. Samuel objects the peril of going on this errand ([Sa1
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#002).md): If Saul hear it, he will kill
me. By this it appears. 1. That Saul had grown very wicked and
outrageous since his rejection, else Samuel would not have mentioned
this. What impiety would he not be guilty of who durst kill Samuel? 2.
That Samuel's faith was not so strong as one would have expected, else
he would not have thus feared the rage of Saul. Would not he that sent
him protect him and bear him out? But the best men are not perfect in
their faith, nor will fear be wholly cast out any where on this side
heaven. But this may be understood as Samuel's desire of direction from
heaven how to manage this matter prudently, so as not to expose himself,
or any other, more than needed.

IV\. God orders him to cover his design with a sacrifice: Say, I have
come to sacrifice; and it was true he did, and it was proper that he
should, when he came to anoint a king, [Sa1
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#015.md). As a prophet, he might
sacrifice when and where God appointed him; and it was not all
inconsistent with the laws of truth to say he came to sacrifice when
really he did so, thought he had also a further end, which he thought
fit to conceal. Let him give notice of a sacrifice, and invite Jesse
(who, it is probable, was the principal man of the city) and his family
to come to the feast upon the sacrifice; and, says God, I will show thee
what thou shalt do. Those that go about God's work in God's way shall be
directed step by step, wherever they are at a loss, to do it in the best
manner.

V. Samuel went accordingly to Bethlehem, not in pomp, or with any
retinue, only a servant to lead the heifer which he was to sacrifice;
yet the elders of Bethlehem trembled at his coming, fearing it was an
indication of God's displeasure against them and that he came to
denounce some judgment for the iniquities of the place. Guilt causes
fear. Yet indeed it becomes us to stand in awe of God's messengers, and
to tremble at his word. Or they feared it might be an occasion of Saul's
displeasure against them, for probably they knew how much he was
exasperated at Samuel, and feared he would pick a quarrel with them for
entertaining him. They asked him, "Comest thou peaceably? Art thou in
peace thyself, and not flying from Saul? Art thou at peace with us, and
not come with any message of wrath?" We should all covet earnestly to
stand upon good terms with God's prophets, and dread having the word of
God, or their prayers, against us. When the Son of David was born king
of the Jews all Jerusalem was troubled, [Mat
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#003.md). Samuel kept at home, and it was a
strange thing to see him so far from his own house: they therefore
concluded it must needs be some extraordinary occasion that brought him,
and feared the worst till he satisfied them ([Sa1
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#005).md): "I come peaceably, for I come
to sacrifice, not with a message of wrath against you, but with the
methods of peace and reconciliation; and therefore you may bid me
welcome and need not fear my coming; therefore sanctify yourselves, and
prepare to join with me in the sacrifice, that you may have the benefit
of it." Note, Before solemn ordinances there must be a solemn
protestation. When we are to offer spiritual sacrifices it concerns us,
by sequestering ourselves from the world and renewing the dedication of
ourselves to God, to sanctify ourselves. When our Lord Jesus came into
the world, though men had reason enough to tremble, fearing that his
errand was to condemn the world, yet he gave full assurance that he came
peaceably, for he came to sacrifice, and he brought his offering along
with him: A body hast thou prepared me. Let us sanctify ourselves, that
we may have an interest in his sacrifice. Note, Those that come to
sacrifice should come peaceably; religious exercises must not be
performed tumultuously.

VI\. He had a particular regard to Jesse and his sons, for with them his
private business lay, with which, it is likely, he acquainted Jesse at
his first coming, and took up his lodging at his house. He spoke to all
the elders to sanctify themselves, but he sanctified Jesse and his sons
by praying with them and instructing them. Perhaps he had acquaintance
with them before, and it appears ([Sa1
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#029.md), where we read of the sacrifices
that family had) that it was a devout religious family. Samuel assisted
them in their family preparations for the public sacrifice, and, it is
probable, chose out David, and anointed him, at the family-solemnities,
before the sacrifice was offered or the holy feast solemnized. Perhaps
he offered private sacrifices, like Job, according to the number of them
all ([Job 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#005).md), and, under colour of
that, called for them all to appear before him. When signal blessings
are coming into a family they ought to sanctify themselves.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 16:6</span></span>

If the sons of Jesse were told that God would provide himself a king
among them (as he had said, [Sa1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001).md), we may well suppose they all
made the best appearance they could, and each hoped he should be the
man; but here we are told,

I. How all the elder sons, who stood fairest for the preferment, were
passed by.

1\. Eliab, the eldest, was privately presented first to Samuel, probably
none being present but Jesse only, and Samuel thought he must needs be
the man: Surely this is the Lord's anointed, [Sa1
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#006.md). The prophets themselves, when
they spoke from under the divine direction, were as liable to mistake as
other men; as Nathan, [Sa2 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#003.md). But
God rectified the prophet's mistake by a secret whisper to his mind:
Look not on his countenance, [Sa1
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#007.md). It was strange that Samuel, who
had been so wretchedly disappointed in Saul, whose countenance and
stature recommended him as much as any man's could, should be so forward
to judge of a man by that rule. When God would please the people with a
king he chose a comely man; but, when he would have one after his own
heart, he should not be chosen by the outside. Men judge by the sight of
the eyes, but God does not, [Isa 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#003.md).
The Lord looks on the heart, that is, (1.) He knows it. We can tell how
men look, but he can tell what they are. Man looks on the eyes (so the
original word is), and is pleased with the liveliness and sprightliness
that appear in them; but God looks on the heart, and sees the thoughts
and intents of that. (2.) He judges of men by it. The good disposition
of the heart, the holiness or goodness of that, recommends us to God,
and is in his sight of great price ([Pe1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#004).md), not the majesty of the look, or
the strength and stature of the body. Let us reckon that to be true
beauty which is within, and judge of men, as far as we are capable, by
their minds, not their mien.

2\. When Eliab was set aside, Abinadab and Shammah, and, after them,
four more of the sons of Jesse, seven in all, were presented to Samuel,
as likely for his purpose; but Samuel, who not attended more carefully
than he did at first to the divine direction, rejected them all: The
Lord has not chosen these, [Sa1 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#008.md),
[Sa1 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#010.md). Men dispose of their
honours and estates to their sons according to their seniority of age
and priority of birth, but God does not. The elder shall serve the
younger. Had it been left to Samuel, or Jesse, to make the choice, one
of these would certainly have been chosen; but God will magnify his
sovereignty in passing by some that were most promising as well as in
fastening on others that were less so.

II\. How David at length was pitched upon. He was the youngest of all
the sons of Jesse; his name signifies beloved, for he was a type of the
beloved Son. Observe, 1. How he was in the fields, keeping the sheep
([Sa1 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#011).md), and was left there,
though there was a sacrifice and a feast at his father's house. The
youngest are commonly the fondlings of the family, but, it should seem,
David was least set by of all the sons of Jesse; either they did not
discern or did not duly value the excellent spirit he was of. Many a
great genius lies buried in obscurity and contempt; and God often exalts
those whom men despise and gives abundant honour to that part which
lacked. The Son of David was he whom men despised, the stone which the
builders refused, and yet he has a name above every name. David was
taken from following ewes to feed Jacob ([Psa
78:71](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#071).md), as Moses from keeping the
flock of Jethro, an instance of his humility and industry, both which
God delights to put honour upon. We should think a military life, but
God saw a pastoral life (which gives advantage for contemplation and
communion with heaven), the best preparative for kingly power, at least
for those graces of the Spirit which are necessary to the due discharge
of that trust which attends it. David was keeping sheep, though it was a
time of sacrifice; for there is mercy that takes precedence of
sacrifice. 2. How earnest Samuel was to have him sent for: "We will not
sit down to meat" (perhaps it was not the feast upon the sacrifice, but
a common meal) "till he come hither; for, if all the rest be rejected,
this must be he." He that designed not to sit at table at all is now
waited for as the principal guest. If God will exalt those of low
degree, who can hinder? 3. What appearance he made when he did come. No
notice is taken of his clothing. No doubt that was according to his
employment, mean and coarse, as shepherds' coats commonly are, and he
did not change his clothes as Joseph did ([Gen
41:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#014).md), but he had a very honest look,
not stately, as Saul's, but sweet and lovely: He was ruddy, of a
beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to ([Sa1
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#012).md), that is, he had a clear
complexion, a good eye, and a lovely face; the features were
extraordinary, and there was something in his looks that was very
charming. Though he was so far from using any art to help his beauty
that his employment exposed it to the sun and wind, yet nature kept its
own, and, by the sweetness of his aspect, gave manifest indications of
an amiable temper and disposition of mind. Perhaps his modest blush,
when he was brought before Samuel, and received by him with surprising
respect, made him look much the handsomer. 4. The anointing of him. The
Lord told Samuel in his ear (as he had done, [Sa1
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#015).md) that this was he whom he must
anoint, [Sa1 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#012.md). Samuel objects not
the meanness of his education, his youth, or the little respect he had
in his own family, but, in obedience to the divine command, took his
horn of oil and anointed him ([Sa1
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#013)), signifying thereby, (1..md) A
divine designation to the government, after the death of Saul, of which
hereby he gave him a full assurance. Not that he was at present invested
with the royal power, but it was entailed upon him, to come to him in
due time. (2.) A divine communication of gifts and graces, to fit him
for the government, and make him a type of him who was to be the
Messiah, the anointed One, who received the Spirit, not by measure, but
without measure. He is said to be anointed in the midst of his brethren,
who yet, possibly, did not understand it as a designation to the
government, and therefore did not envy David (as Joseph's brethren did
him), because they saw no further marks of dignity put upon him, no, not
so much as a coat of divers colours. But bishop Patrick reads it, He
anointed him from the midst of his brethren, that is, he singled him out
from the rest, and privately anointed him, but with a charge to keep his
own counsel, and not to let his own brethren know it, as by what we find
([Sa1 17:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#028).md), it should seem, Eliab
did not. It is computed that David now was about twenty years old; if
so, his troubles by Saul lasted ten years, for he was thirty years old
when Saul died. Dr. Lightfoot reckons that he was about twenty-five, and
that his troubles lasted but five years. 5. The happy effects of this
anointing: The Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward,
[Sa1 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#013.md). The anointing of him was
not an empty ceremony, but a divine power went along with that
instituted sign, and he found himself inwardly advanced in wisdom, and
courage, and concern for the public, with all the qualifications of a
prince, though not at all advanced in his outward circumstances. This
would abundantly satisfy him that his election was of God. The best
evidence of our being predestinated to the kingdom of glory is our being
sealed with the Spirit of promise, and our experience of a work of grace
in our own hearts. Some think that his courage, by which he slew the
lion and the bear, and his extraordinary skill in music, were the
effects and evidences of the Spirit's coming upon him. However, this
made him the sweet psalmist of Israel, [Sa2
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001.md). Samuel, having done this, went
to Ramah in safety, and we never read of him again but once ([Sa1
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#018).md), till we read of his death; now
he retired to die in peace, since his eyes had seen the salvation, even
the sceptre brought into the tribe of Judah.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 16:14</span></span>

We have here Saul falling and David rising.

I. Here is Saul made a terror to himself ([Sa1
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#014).md): The Spirit of the Lord
departed from him. He having forsaken God and his duty, God, in a way of
righteous judgment, withdrew from him those assistances of the good
Spirit with which he was directed, animated, and encouraged in his
government and wars. He lost all his good qualities. This was the effect
of his rejecting God, and an evidence of his being rejected by him. Now
God took his mercy from Saul (as it is expressed, [Sa2
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#015).md); for, when the Spirit of the
Lord departs from us, all good goes. When men grieve and quench the
Spirit, by wilful sin, he departs, and will not always strive. The
consequence of this was that an evil spirit from God troubled him. Those
that drive the good Spirit away from the do of course become prey to the
evil spirit. If God and his grace do not rule us, sin and Satan will
have possession of us. The devil, by the divine permission, troubled and
terrified Saul, by means of the corrupt humours of his body and passions
of his mind. He grew fretful, and peevish, and discontented, timorous
and suspicious, ever and anon starting and trembling; he was sometimes,
says Josephus, as if he had been choked or strangled, and a perfect
demoniac by fits. This made him unfit for business, precipitate in his
counsels, the contempt of his enemies, and a burden to all about him.

II\. Here is David made a physician to Saul, and by this means brought
to court, a physician that helped him against the worst of diseases,
when none else could. David was newly appointed privately to the
kingdom. It would be of use to him to go to court and see the world; and
here his doing so is brought about for him without any contrivance of
his own or his friends. Note, Those whom God designs for any service his
providence shall concur with his grace to prepare and qualify for it.
Saul is distempered; his servants have the honesty and courage to tell
him what his distemper is ([Sa1
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#015).md), an evil spirit, not by chance
but from God and his providence, troubleth thee. Now, 1. The means they
all advised him to for his relief was music ([Sa1
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#016).md): "Let us have a cunning player
on the harp to attend thee." How much better friends had they been to
him if they had advised him, since the evil spirit was from the Lord, to
give all diligence to make his peace with God by true repentance, to
send for Samuel to pray with him and to intercede with God for him! then
might he not only have had some present relief, but the good Spirit
would have returned to him. But their project is to make him merry, and
so cure him. Many whose consciences are convinced and startled are for
ever ruined by such methods as these, which drown all care of the soul
in the delights of sense. Yet Saul's servants did not amiss to send for
music as a help to cheer up the spirits, if they had but withal sent for
a prophet to give him good counsel. And (as bishop Hall observes) it was
well they did not send for a witch or diviner, by his enchantments to
cast out the evil spirit, which has been the abominably wicked practice
of some that have worn the Christian name, who consult the devil in
their distresses and make hell their refuge. It will be no less than a
miracle of divine grace if those who thus agree with Satan ever break
off from him again. 2. One of his servants recommended David to him, as
a fit person to be employed in the use of these means, little imagining
that he was the man whom Samuel meant when he told Saul of a neighbour
of his, better than he, who should have the kingdom, [Sa1
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#028.md). It is a very high character
which the servant of Saul's here gives of David ([Sa1
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#018).md), that he was not only fit for
his purpose as a comely person and skilful in playing, but a man of
courage and conduct, a mighty valiant man, and prudent in all matters,
fit to be further preferred, and (which crowned his character) the Lord
is with him. By this it appears that though David, after he was
anointed, returned to his country business, and there remained on his
head no marks of the oil, so careful was he to keep that secret, yet the
workings of the Spirit signified by the oil could not be hid, but made
him shine in obscurity, so that all his neighbours observed with wonder
the great improvements of his mind on a sudden. David, even in his
shepherd's garb, has become an oracle, a champion, and every thing that
is great. His fame reached the court soon, for Saul was inquisitive
after such young men, [Sa1 14:52](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#052.md). When
the Spirit of God comes upon a man he will make his face to shine. 3.
David is hereupon sent for to court. And it seems, (1.) His father was
very willing to part with him, sent him very readily, and a present with
him to Saul, [Sa1 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#020.md). The present
was, according to the usage of those times, bread and wine (compare,
[Sa1 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#003.md), [Sa1
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#004).md), therefore acceptable because
expressive of the homage and allegiance of him that sent it. Probably
Jesse, who knew what his son David was designed for, was aware that
Providence was herein fitting him for it, and therefore he would not
force Providence by sending him to court uncalled, yet he followed
Providence very cheerfully when he saw it plainly putting him into the
way of preferment. Some suggest that when Jesse received that message,
Send me David thy son, he began to be afraid that Saul had got some
intimation of his being anointed, and sent for him to do him a mischief,
and therefore Jesse sent a present to pacify him; but it is probable
that the person, whoever he was, that brought the message, gave him an
account on what design he was sent for. (2.) Saul became very kind to
him ([Sa1 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#021).md), loved him greatly,
and designed to make him his armour-bearer, and (contrary to the manner
of the king, [Sa1 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#011).md) asked his
father's leave to keep him in his service ([Sa1
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#022).md): Let David, I pray thee, stand
before me. And good reason he had to respect him, for he did him a great
deal of service with his music, [Sa1
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#023.md). Only his instrumental music
with his harp is mentioned, but it should seem, by the account Josephus
gives, that he added vocal music to it, and sung hymns, probably divine
hymns, songs of praise, to his harp. David's music was Saul's physic.
\[1.\] Music has a natural tendency to compose and exhilarate the mind,
when it is disturbed and saddened. Elisha used it for the calming of his
spirits, [Kg2 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#015.md). On some it has a
greater influence and effect than on others, and, probably, Saul was one
of those. Not that it charmed the evil spirit, but it made his spirit
sedate, and allayed those tumults of the animal spirits by which the
devil had advantage against him. The beams of the sun (it is the learned
Bochart's comparison) cannot be cut with a sword, quenched with water,
or blown out with wind, but, by closing the window-shutters, they may be
kept out of the chamber. Music cannot work upon the devil, but it may
shut up the passages by which he has access to the mind. \[2.\] David's
music was extraordinary, and in mercy to him, that he might gain a
reputation at court, as one that had the Lord with him. God made his
performances in music more successful, in this case, than those of
others would have been. Saul found, even after he had conceived an
enmity to David, that no one else could do him the same service ([Kg2
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#009.md), [Kg2
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#010).md), which was a great aggravation
of his outrage against him. It is a pity that music, which may be so
serviceable to the good temper of the mind, should ever be abused by any
to the support of vanity and luxury, and made an occasion of drawing the
heart away from God and serious things: if this be to any the effect of
it, it drives away the good Spirit, not the evil spirit.
