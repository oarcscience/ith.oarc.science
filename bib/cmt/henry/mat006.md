### [Matthew Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#001.md)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 6:0</span></span>

Christ having, in the former chapter, armed his disciples against the
corrupt doctrines and opinions of the scribes and Pharisees, especially
in their expositions of the law (that was called their leaven, [Mat
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#012).md), comes in this chapter to warn
them against their corrupt practices, against the two sins which, though
in their doctrine they did not justify, yet in their conversation they
were notoriously guilty of, and so as even to recommend them to their
admirers: these were hypocrisy and worldly-mindedness, sins which, of
all others, the professors of religion need most to guard against, as
sins that most easily beset those who have escaped the grosser
pollutions that are in the world through lust, and which are therefore
highly dangerous. We are here cautioned, I. Against hypocrisy; we must
not be as the hypocrites are, nor do as the hypocrites do. 1. In the
giving of alms ([Mat 6:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#001).md). 2. In
prayer ([Mat 6:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#005).md). We are here
taught what to pray for, and how to pray ([Mat
6:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#009).md); and to forgive in prayer
([Mat 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#014.md), [Mat
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#015).md). 3. In fasting ([Mat
6:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#016).md). II. Against
worldly-mindedness, 1. In our choice, which is the destroying sin of
hypocrites ([Mat 6:19-24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019).md). 2. In our
cares, which is the disquieting sin of many good Christians ([Mat
6:25-34](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025).md).

[Matthew 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 6:1</span></span>

As we must do better than the scribes and Pharisees in avoiding
heart-sins, heart-adultery, and heart-murder, so likewise in maintaining
and keeping up heart-religion, doing what we do from an inward, vital
principle, that we may be approved of God, not that we may be applauded
of men; that is, we must watch against hypocrisy, which was the leaven
of the Pharisees, as well as against their doctrine, [Luk
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001.md). Almsgiving, prayer, and fasting,
are three great Christian duties - the three foundations of the law, say
the Arabians: by them we do homage and service to God with our three
principal interests; by prayer with our souls, by fasting with our
bodies, by alms-giving with our estates. Thus we must not only depart
from evil, but do good, and do it well, and so dwell for evermore.

Now in these verses we area cautioned against hypocrisy in giving alms.
Take heed of it. Our being bid to take heed of it intimates that it is
sin. 1. We are in great danger of; it is a subtle sin; vain-glory
insinuates itself into what we do ere we are aware. The disciples would
be tempted to it by the power they had to do many wondrous works, and
their living with some that admired them and others that despised them,
both which are temptations to covet to make a fair show in the flesh. 2.
It is a sin we are in great danger by. Take heed of hypocrisy, for if it
reign in you, it will ruin you. It is the dead fly that spoils the whole
box of precious ointment.

Two things are here supposed,

I. The giving of alms is a great duty, and a duty which all the
disciples of Christ, according to their ability, must abound in. It is
prescribed by the law of nature and of Moses, and great stress is laid
upon it by the prophets. Divers ancient copies here for tēn eleēmosunēn
- your alms, read tēn dikaiosunēn - your righteousness, for alms are
righteousness, [Psa 112:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009.md); [Pro
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#002.md). The Jews called the poor's box
the box of righteousness. That which is given to the poor is said to be
their due, [Pro 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#027.md). The duty is not
the less necessary and excellent for its being abused by hypocrites to
serve their pride. If superstitious papists have placed a merit in works
of charity, that will not be an excuse for covetous protestants that are
barren in such good works. It is true, our alms-deeds do not deserve
heaven; but it is as true that we cannot go to heaven without them. It
is pure religion ([Jam 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027).md), and will
be the test at the great day; Christ here takes it for granted that his
disciples give alms, nor will he own those that do not.

II\. That it is such a duty as has a great reward attending it, which is
lost if it be done in hypocrisy. It is sometimes rewarded in temporal
things with plenty ([Pro 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#024.md), [Pro
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#025.md); [Pro
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017).md); security from want ([Pro
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#027.md); [Psa
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#021.md), [Psa
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025).md); succour in distress ([Psa
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md), [Psa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#002).md); honour and a good name, which
follow those most that least covet them, [Psa
112:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009.md). However, it shall be
recompensed in the resurrection of the just ([Luk
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#014).md), in eternal riches.

Quas dederis, solas semper habebis, opes.

The riches you impart form the only wealth you will always retain.

\- Martial.

This being supposed, observe now,

1\. What was the practice of the hypocrites about this duty. They did it
indeed, but not from any principle of obedience to God, or love to man,
but in pride and vain-glory; not in compassion to the poor, but purely
for ostentation, that they might be extolled as good men, and so might
gain an interest in the esteem of the people, with which they knew how
to serve their own turn, and to get a great deal more than they gave.
Pursuant to this intention, they chose to give their alms in the
synagogues, and in the streets, where there was the greatest concourse
of people to observe them, who applauded their liberality because they
shared in it, but were so ignorant as not to discern their abominable
pride. Probably they had collections for the poor in the synagogues, and
the common beggars haunted the streets and highways, and upon these
public occasions they chose to give their alms. Not that it is unlawful
to give alms when men see us; we may do it; but not that men may see us;
we should rather choose those objects of charity that are less observed.
The hypocrites, if they gave alms to their own houses, sounded a
trumpet, under pretence of calling the poor together to be served, but
really to proclaim their charity, and to have that taken notice of and
made the subject of discourse.

Now the doom that Christ passes upon this is very observable; Verily I
say unto you, they have their reward. At first view this seems a promise
- If they have their reward they have enough, but two words in it make
it a threatening.

(1.) It is a reward, but it is their reward; not the reward which God
promises to them that do good, but the reward which they promise
themselves, and a poor reward it is; they did it to be seen of men, and
they are seen of men; they chose their own delusions with which they
cheated themselves, and they shall have what they chose. Carnal
professors stipulate with God for preferment, honour, wealth, and they
shall have their bellies filled with those things ([Psa
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014).md); but let them expect no more;
these are their consolation ([Luk
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024).md), their good things ([Luk
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#025).md), and they shall be put off with
these. "Didst thou not agree with me for a penny? It is the bargain that
thou art likely to abide by."

(2.) It is a reward, but it is a present reward, they have it; and there
is none reserved for them in the future state. They now have all that
they are likely to have from God; they have their reward here, and have
none to hope for hereafter. Apechousi ton misthon. It signifies a
receipt in full. What rewards the godly have in this life are but in
part of payment; there is more behind, much more; but hypocrites have
their all in this world, so shall their doom be; themselves have decided
it. The world is but for provision to the saints, it is their
spending-money; but it is pay to hypocrites, it is their portion.

2\. What is the precept of our Lord Jesus about it, [Mat
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#003.md), [Mat
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#004.md). He that was himself such an
example of humility, pressed it upon his disciples, as absolutely
necessary to the acceptance of their performances. "Let not thy left
hand know what thy right hand doeth when thou givest alms." Perhaps this
alludes to the placing of the Corban, the poor man's box, or the chest
into which they cast their free-will offerings, on the right hand of the
passage into the temple; so that they put their gifts into it with the
right-hand. Or the giving of alms with the right hand, intimates
readiness to it and resolution in it; do it dexterously, not awkwardly
nor with a sinister intention. The right hand may be used in helping the
poor, lifting them up, writing for them, dressing their sores, and other
ways besides giving to them; but, "whatever kindness thy right hand
doeth to the poor, let not thy left hand know it: conceal it as much as
possible; industriously keep it private. Do it because it is a good
work, not because it will give thee a good name." In omnibus factis, re,
non teste, moveamur - In all our actions, we should be influenced by a
regard to the object, not to the observer. Cic. de Fin. It is intimated,
(1.) That we must not let others know what we do; no, not those that
stand at our left hand, that are very near us. Instead of acquainting
them with it, keep it from them if possible; however, appear so desirous
to keep it from them, as that in civility they may seem not to take
notice of it, and keep it to themselves, and let it go no further. (2.)
That we must not observe it too much ourselves: the left hand is a part
of ourselves; we must not within ourselves take notice too much of the
good we do, must not applaud and admire ourselves. Self-conceit and
self-complacency, and an adoring of our own shadow, are branches of
pride, as dangerous as vain-glory and ostentation before men. We find
those had their good works remembered to their honour, who had
themselves forgotten them: When saw we thee an hungered, or athirst?

3\. What is the promise to those who are thus sincere and humble in
their alms-giving. Let thine alms be in secret, and then thy Father who
seeth in secret will observe them. Note, When we take least notice of
our good deeds ourselves, God takes most notice of them. As God hears
the wrongs done to us when we do not hear them ([Psa
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#014.md), [Psa
38:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#015).md), so he sees the good done by
us, when we do not see it. As it is a terror to hypocrites, so it is a
comfort to sincere Christians, that God sees in secret. But this is not
all; not only the observation and praise, but the recompence is of God,
himself shall reward thee openly. Note, They who in their alms-giving
study to approve themselves to God, only turn themselves over to him as
their Paymaster. The hypocrite catches at the shadow, but the upright
man makes sure of the substance. Observe how emphatically it is
expressed; himself shall reward, he will himself be the Rewarder, [Heb
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006.md). Let him alone to make it up in
kind or kindness; nay, he will himself be the Reward ([Gen
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001).md), thine exceeding great reward.
He will reward thee as thy Father, not as a master who gives his servant
just what he earns and no more, but as a father who gives abundantly
more, and without stint, to his son that serves him. Nay, he shall
reward thee openly, if not in the present day, yet in the great day;
then shall every man have praise of God, open praise, thou shall be
confessed before men. If the work be not open, the reward shall, and
that is better.

[Matthew 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 6:5</span></span>

In prayer we have more immediately to do with God than in giving alms,
and therefore are yet more concerned to be sincere, which is what we are
here directed to. When thou prayest ([Mat
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#005).md). It is taken for granted that all
the disciples of Christ pray. As soon as ever Paul was converted, behold
he prayeth. You may as soon find a living man that does not breathe, as
a living Christian that does not pray. For this shall every one that is
godly pray. If prayerless, then graceless. "Now, when thou prayest, thou
shalt not be as the hypocrites are, nor do as they do," [Mat
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#002.md). Note, Those who would not do as
the hypocrites do in their ways and actions must not be as the
hypocrites are in their frame and temper. He names nobody, but it
appears by [Mat 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#013.md), that by the
hypocrites here he means especially the scribes and Pharisees.

Now there were two great faults they were guilty of in prayer, against
each of which we are here cautioned - vain-glory ([Mat
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#005.md), [Mat
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#006).md); and vain repetitions, [Mat
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#007.md), [Mat
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#008.md).

I. We must not be proud and vain-glorious in prayer, nor aim at the
praise of men. And here observe,

1\. What was the way and practice of the hypocrites. In all their
exercises of devotion, it was plain, the chief thing they aimed at was
to be commended by their neighbours, and thereby to make an interest for
themselves. When they seemed to soar upwards in prayer (and if it be
right, it is the soul's ascent toward God), yet even then their eye was
downwards upon this as their prey. Observe,

(1.) What the places were which they chose for their devotions; they
prayed in the synagogues, which were indeed proper places for public
prayer, but not for personal. They pretended hereby to do honour to the
place of their assemblies, but intended to do honour to themselves. They
prayed in the corners of the streets, the broad streets (so the word
signifies), which were most frequented. They withdrew thither, as if
they were under a pious impulse which would not admit delay, but really
it was to cause themselves to be taken notice of. There, where two
streets met, they were not only within view of both, but every passenger
turning close upon them would observe them, and hear what they said.

(2.) The posture they used in prayer; they prayed standing; this is a
lawful and proper posture for prayer ([Mar
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#025), When ye stand praying.md), but
kneeling being the more humble and reverent gesture, [Luk
22:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#041.md); [Act
7:60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060.md); [Eph
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#014.md), their standing seemed to savour
of pride and confidence in themselves ([Luk
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#011).md), The Pharisee stood and prayed.

(3.) Their pride in choosing these public places, which is expressed in
two things: \[1.\] They love to pray there. They did not love prayer for
its own sake, but they loved it when it gave them an opportunity of
making themselves noticed. Circumstances may be such, that our good
deeds must needs be done openly, so as to fall under the observation of
others, and be commended by them; but the sin and danger is when we love
it, and are pleased with it, because it feeds the proud humour. \[2.\]
It is that they may be seen of men; not that God might accept them, but
that men might admire and applaud them; and that they might easily get
the estates of widows and orphans into their hands (who would not trust
such devout, praying men?) and that, when they had them, they might
devour them without being suspected ([Mat
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014).md); and effectually carry on their
public designs to enslave the people.

(4.) The product of all this, they have their reward; they have all the
recompence they must ever expect from God for their service, and a poor
recompence it is. What will it avail us to have the good word of our
fellow-servants, if our Master do not say, Well done? But if in so great
a transaction as is between us and God, when we are at prayer, we can
take in so poor a consideration as the praise of men is, it is just that
that should be all our reward. They did it to be seen of men, and they
are so; and much good may it do them. Note, Those that would approve
themselves to God by their integrity in their religion, must have to
regard to the praise of men; it is not to men that we pray, nor from
them that we expect an answer; they are not to be our judges, they are
dust and ashes like ourselves, and therefore we must not have our eye to
them: what passes between God and our own souls must be out of sight. In
our synagogue-worship, we must avoid every thing that tends to make our
personal devotion remarkable, as they that caused their voice to be
heard on high, [Isa 58:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#004.md). Public
places are not proper for private solemn prayer.

2\. What is the will of Jesus Christ in opposition to this. Humility and
sincerity are the two great lessons that Christ teaches us; Thou, when
thou prayest, do so and so ([Mat 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#006).md);
thou in particular by thyself, and for thyself. Personal prayer is here
supposed to be the duty and practice of all Christ's disciples.

Observe, (1.) The directions here given about it.

\[1.\] Instead of praying in the synagogues and in the corners of the
streets, enter into thy closet, into some place of privacy and
retirement. Isaac went into the field ([Gen
24:63](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#063).md), Christ to a mountain, Peter to
a housetop. No place amiss in point of ceremony, if it do but answer the
end. Note, Secret prayer is to be performed in retirement, that we may
be unobserved, and so may avoid ostentation; undisturbed, and so may
avoid distraction; unheard, and so may use greater freedom; yet if the
circumstances be such that we cannot possibly avoid being taken notice
of, we must not therefore neglect the duty, lest the omission be a
greater scandal than the observation of it.

\[2.\] Instead of doing it to be seen of men, pray to thy Father who is
in secret; to me, even to me, [Zac
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#005.md), [Zac
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#006.md). The Pharisees prayed rather to
men than to God; whatever was the form of their prayer, the scope of it
was to beg the applause of men, and court their favours. "Well, do thou
pray to God, and let that be enough for thee. Pray to him as a Father,
as thy Father, ready to hear and answer, graciously inclined to pity,
help, and succour thee. Pray to thy Father who is in secret." Note, In
secret prayer we must have an eye to God, as present in all places; he
is there in thy closet when no one else is there; there especially nigh
to thee in what thou callest upon him for. By secret prayer we give God
the glory of his universal presence ([Act
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#024).md), and may take to ourselves the
comfort of it.

(2.) The encouragements here given us to it.

\[1.\] Thy Father seeth in secret; his eye is upon thee to accept thee,
when the eye of no man is upon thee to applaud thee; under the fig-tree,
I saw thee, said Christ to Nathaniel, [Joh
1:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#048.md). He saw Paul at prayer in such a
street, at such a house, [Act 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#011.md).
There is not a secret, sudden breathing after God, but he observes it.

\[2.\] He will reward thee openly; they have their reward that do it
openly, and thou shalt not lose thine for thy doing it in secret. It is
called a reward, but it is of grace, not of debt; what merit can there
be in begging? The reward will be open; they shall not only have it, but
have it honourably: the open reward is that which hypocrites are fond
of, but they have not patience to stay for it; it is that which the
sincere are dead to, and they shall have it over and above. Sometimes
secret prayers are rewarded openly in this world by signal answers to
them, which manifests God's praying people in the consciences of their
adversaries; however, at the great day there will be an open reward,
when all praying people shall appear in glory with the great
Intercessor. The Pharisees ha their reward before all the town, and it
was a mere flash and shadow; true Christians shall have theirs before
all the world, angels and men, and it shall be a weight of glory.

II\. We must not use vain repetitions in prayer, [Mat
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#007.md), [Mat
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#008.md). Though the life of prayer lies in
lifting up the soul and pouring out the heart, yet there is some
interest which words have in prayer, especially in joint prayer; for in
that, words are necessary, and it should seem that our Saviour speaks
here especially of that; for before he said, when thou prayest, he here,
when ye pray; and the Lord's prayer which follows is a joint prayer, and
in that, he that is the mouth of others is most tempted to an
ostentation of language and expression, against which we are here
warned; use not vain repetitions, either alone or with others: the
Pharisees affected this, they made long prayers ([Mat
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014).md), all their care was to make
them long. Now observe,

1\. What the fault is that is here reproved and condemned; it is making
a mere lip-labour of the duty of prayer, the service of the tongue, when
it is not the service of the soul. This is expressed here by two words,
Battologia, polulogia. (1.) Vain repetitions - tautology, battology,
idle babbling over the same words again and again to no purpose, like
Battus, Sub illis montibus erant, erant sub montibus illis; like that
imitation of the wordiness of a fool, [Ecc
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#014.md), A man cannot tell what shall
be; and what shall be after him who can tell? which is indecent and
nauseous in any discourse, much more in speaking to God. It is not all
repetition in prayer that is here condemned, but vain repetitions.
Christ himself prayed, saying the same words ([Mat
26:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#044).md), out of more than ordinary
fervour and zeal, [Luk 22:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#044.md). So
Daniel, [Dan 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#018.md), [Dan
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#019.md). And there is a very elegant
repetition of the same words, Ps. 136. It may be of use both to express
our own affections, and to excite the affections of others. But the
superstitious rehearsing of a tale of words, without regard to the sense
of them, as the papists saying by their beads so many Ave-Marys and
Paternosters; or the barren and dry going over of the same things again
and again, merely to drill out the prayer to such a length, and to make
a show of affection when really there is none; these are the vain
repetitions here condemned. When we would fain say much, but cannot say
much to the purpose; this is displeasing to God and all wise men. (2.)
Much speaking, an affectation of prolixity in prayer, either out of
pride or superstition, or an opinion that God needs either to be
informed or argued with by us, or out of mere folly and impertinence,
because men love to hear themselves talk. Not that all long prayers are
forbidden; Christ prayed all night, [Luk
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#012.md). Solomon's was a long prayer.
There is sometimes need of long prayers when our errands and our
affections are extraordinary; but merely to prolong the prayer, as if it
would make it more pleasing or more prevailing with God, is that which
is here condemned; it is not much praying that is condemned; no, we are
bid to pray always, but much speaking; the danger of this error is when
we only say our prayers, and not when we pray them. This caution is
explained by that of Solomon ([Ecc
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#002).md), Let thy words be few,
considerate and well weighed; take with you words ([Hos
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002).md), choose out words ([Job
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#014).md), and do not say every thing that
comes uppermost.

2\. What reasons are given against this.

(1.) This is the way of the heathen, as the heathen do; and it ill
becomes Christians to worship their God as the Gentiles worship theirs.
The heathen were taught by the light of nature to worship God; but
becoming vain in their imaginations concerning the object of their
worship, no wonder they became so concerning the manner of it, and
particularly in this instance; thinking God altogether such a one as
themselves, they thought he needed many words to make him understand
what was said to him, or to bring him to comply with their requests; as
if he were weak and ignorant, and hard to be entreated. Thus Baal's
priests were hard at it from morning till almost night with their vain
repetitions; O Baal, hear us; O Baal, hear us; and vain petitions they
were; but Elijah, in a grave, composed frame, with a very concise
prayer, prevailed for fire from heaven first, and then water, [Kg1
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#026.md), [Kg1
18:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#036.md). Lip-labour in prayer, though
ever so well laboured, if that be all, is but lost labour.

(2.) "It need not be your way, for your Father in heaven knoweth what
things ye have need of before ye ask him, and therefore there is no
occasion for such abundance of words. It does not follow that therefore
ye need not pray; for God requires you by prayer to own your need of him
and dependence on him, and to please his promises; but therefore you are
to open your case, and pour out your hearts before him, and then leave
it with him." Consider, \[1.\] The God we pray to is our Father by
creation, by covenant; and therefore our addresses to him should be
easy, natural, and unaffected; children do not use to make long speeches
to their parents when they want any thing; it is enough to say, my head,
my head. Let us come to him with the disposition of children, with love,
reverence, and dependence; and then they need not say many words, that
are taught by the Spirit of adoption to say that one aright, Abba,
Father. \[2.\] He is a Father that knows our case and knows our wants
better than we do ourselves. He knows what things we have need of; his
eyes run to and fro through the earth, to observe the necessities of his
people ([Ch2 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#009).md), and he often gives
before we call ([Isa 65:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#024).md), and more
than we ask for ([Eph 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020).md), and if he
do not give his people what they ask, it is because he knows they do not
need it, and that it is not for their good; and of that he is fitter to
judge for us than we for ourselves. We need not be long, nor use many
words in representing our case; God knows it better than we can tell
him, only he will know it from us (what will ye that I should do unto
you?); and when we have told him what it is, we must refer ourselves to
him, Lord, all my desire is before thee, [Psa
38:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#009.md). So far is God from being wrought
upon by the length or language of our prayers, that the most powerful
intercessions are those which are made with groanings that cannot be
uttered, [Rom 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026.md). We are not to
prescribe, but subscribe to God.

[Matthew 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 6:9</span></span>

When Christ had condemned what was amiss, he directs to do better; for
his are reproofs of instruction. Because we know not what to pray for as
we ought, he here helps our infirmities, by putting words into our
mouths; after this manner therefore pray ye, [Mat
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#009.md). So many were the corruptions that
had crept into this duty of prayer among the Jews, that Christ saw it
needful to give a new directory for prayer, to show his disciples what
must ordinarily be the matter and method of their prayer, which he gives
in words that may very well be used as a form; as the summary or
contents of the several particulars of our prayers. Not that we are tied
up to the use of this form only, or of this always, as if this were
necessary to the consecrating of our other prayers; we are here bid to
pray after this manner, with these words, or to this effect. That in
Luke differs from this; we do not find it used by the apostles; we are
not here taught to pray in the name of Christ, as we are afterward; we
are here taught to pray that the kingdom might come which did come when
the Spirit was poured out: yet, without doubt, it is very good to use it
as a form, and it is a pledge of the communion of saints, it having been
used by the church in all ages, at least (says Dr. Whitby) from the
third century. It is our Lord's prayer, it is of his composing, of his
appointing; it is very compendious, yet very comprehensive, in
compassion to our infirmities in praying. The matter is choice and
necessary, the method instructive, and the expression very concise. It
has much in a little, and it is requisite that we acquaint ourselves
with the sense and meaning of it, for it is used acceptably no further
than it is used with understanding and without vain repetition.

The Lord's prayer (as indeed every prayer) is a letter sent from earth
to heaven. Here is the inscription of the letter, the person to whom it
is directed, our Father; the where, in heaven; the contents of it in
several errands of request; the close, for thine is the kingdom; the
seal, Amen; and if you will, the date too, this day.

Plainly thus: there are three parts of the prayer.

I. The preface, Our Father who art in heaven. Before we come to our
business, there must be a solemn address to him with whom our business
lies; Our Father. Intimating, that we must pray, not only alone and for
ourselves, but with and for others; for we are members one of another,
and are called into fellowship with each other. We are here taught to
whom to pray, to God only, and not to saints and angels, for they are
ignorant of us, are not to have the high honours we give in prayer, nor
can give favours we expect. We are taught how to address ourselves to
God, and what title to give him, that which speaks him rather beneficent
than magnificent, for we are to come boldly to the throne of grace.

1\. We must address ourselves to him as our Father, and must call him
so. He is a common Father to all mankind by creation, [Mal
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#010.md); [Act
17:28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028.md). He is in a special manner a
Father to the saints, by adoption and regeneration ([Eph
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005.md); [Gal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006).md); and an unspeakable privilege it
is. Thus we must eye him in prayer, keep up good thoughts of him, such
as are encouraging and not affrighting; nothing more pleasing to God,
nor pleasant to ourselves, than to call God Father. Christ in prayer
mostly called God Father. If he be our Father, he will pity us under our
weaknesses and infirmities ([Psa
103:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#013).md), will spare us ([Mal
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#017).md), will make the best of our
performances, though very defective, will deny us nothing that is good
for us, [Luk 11:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#011.md). We have access
with boldness to him, as to a father, and have an advocate with the
Father, and the Spirit of adoption. When we come repenting of our sins,
we must eye God as a Father, as the prodigal did ([Luk
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#018.md); [Jer
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#019).md); when we come begging for grace,
and peace, and the inheritance and blessing of sons, it is an
encouragement that we come to God, not as an unreconciled, avenging
Judge, but as a loving, gracious, reconciled Father in Christ, [Jer
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#004.md).

2\. As our Father in heaven: so in heaven as to be every where else, for
the heaven cannot contain him; yet so in heaven as there to manifest his
glory, for it is his throne ([Psa
103:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#019).md), and it is to believers a
throne of grace: thitherward we must direct our prayers, for Christ the
Mediator is now in heaven, [Heb 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#001.md).
Heaven is out of sight, and a world of spirits, therefore our converse
with God in prayer must be spiritual; it is on high, therefore in prayer
we must be raised above the world, and lift up our hearts, [Psa
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001.md). Heaven is a place of perfect
purity, and we must therefore lift up pure hands, must study to sanctify
his name, who is the Holy One, and dwells in that holy place, [Lev
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003.md). From heaven God beholds the
children of men, [Psa 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#013.md), [Psa
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#014.md). And we must in prayer see his
eye upon us: thence he has a full and clear view of all our wants and
burdens and desires, and all our infirmities. It is the firmament of his
power likewise, as well as of his prospect, [Psa
150:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#001.md). He is not only, as a Father,
able to help us, able to do great things for us, more than we can ask or
think; he has wherewith to supply our needs, for every good gift is from
above. He is a Father, and therefore we may come to him with boldness,
but a Father in heaven, and therefore we must come with reverence, [Ecc
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#002.md). Thus all our prayers should
correspond with that which is our great aim as Christians, and that is,
to be with God in heaven. God and heaven, the end of our whole
conversation, must be particularly eyed in every prayer; there is the
centre to which we are all tending. By prayer, we send before us
thither, where we profess to be going.

II\. The petitions, and those are six; the three first relating more
immediately to God and his honour, the three last to our own concerns,
both temporal and spiritual; as in the ten commandments, the four first
teach us our duty toward God, and the last six our duty toward our
neighbour. The method of this prayer teaches us to seek first the
kingdom of God and his righteousness, and then to hope that other things
shall be added.

1\. Hallowed be thy name. It is the same word that in other places is
translated sanctified. But here the old word hallowed is retained, only
because people were used to it in the Lord's prayer. In these words,
(1.) We give glory to God; it may be taken not as a petition, but as an
adoration; as that, the Lord be magnified, or glorified, for God's
holiness is the greatness and glory of all his perfections. We must
begin our prayers with praising God, and it is very fit he should be
first served, and that we should give glory to God, before we expect to
receive mercy and grace from him. Let him have praise of his
perfections, and then let us have the benefit of them. (2.) We fix our
end, and it is the right end to be aimed at, and ought to be our chief
and ultimate end in all our petitions, that God may be glorified; all
our other requests must be in subordination to this, and in pursuance of
it. "Father, glorify thyself in giving me my daily bread and pardoning
my sins," etc. Since all is of him and through him, all must be to him
and for him. In prayer our thoughts and affections should be carried out
most to the glory of God. The Pharisees made their own name the chief
end of their prayers ([Mat 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#005.md), to be
seen of men), in opposition to which we are directed to make the name of
God our chief end; let all our petitions centre in this and be regulated
by it. "Do so and so for me, for the glory of thy name, and as far as is
for the glory of it." (3.) We desire and pray that the name of God, that
is, God himself, in all that whereby he has made himself known, may be
sanctified and glorified both by us and others, and especially by
himself. "Father, let thy name be glorified as a Father, and a Father in
heaven; glorify thy goodness and thy highness, thy majesty and mercy.
Let thy name be sanctified, for it is a holy name; no matter what
becomes of our polluted names, but, Lord, what wilt thou do to thy great
name?" When we pray that God's name may be glorified, \[1.\] We make a
virtue of necessity; for God will sanctify his own name, whether we
desire it or not; I will be exalted among the heathen, [Psa
46:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#010.md). \[2.\] We ask for that which we
are sure shall be granted; for when our Saviour prayed, Father glorify
thy name, it was immediately answered, I have glorified it, and will
glorify it again.

2\. Thy kingdom come. This petition has plainly a reference to the
doctrine which Christ preached at this time, which John Baptist had
preached before, and which he afterwards sent his apostles out to preach
- the kingdom of heaven is at hand. The kingdom of your Father who is in
heaven, the kingdom of the Messiah, this is at hand, pray that it may
come. Note, We should turn the word we hear into prayer, our hearts
should echo to it; does Christ promise, surely I come quickly? our
hearts should answer, Even so, come. Ministers should pray over the
word: when they preach, the kingdom of God is at hand, they should pray,
Father, thy kingdom come. What God has promised we must pray for; for
promises are given, not to supersede, but to quicken and encourage
prayer; and when the accomplishment of a promise is near and at the
door, when the kingdom of heaven is at hand, we should then pray for it
the more earnestly; thy kingdom come; as Daniel set his face to pray for
the deliverance of Israel, when he understood that the time of it was at
hand, [Dan 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002.md). See [Luk
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#011.md). It was the Jews' daily prayer
to God, Let him make his kingdom reign, let his redemption flourish, and
let his Messiah come and deliver his people. Dr. Whitby, ex Vitringa.
"Let thy kingdom come, let the gospel be preached to all and embraced by
all; let all be brought to subscribe to the record God has given in his
word concerning his Son, and to embrace him as their Saviour and
Sovereign. Let the bounds of the gospel-church be enlarged, the kingdom
of the world be made Christ's kingdom, and all men become subjects to
it, and live as becomes their character."

3\. Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. We pray that God's
kingdom being come, we and others may be brought into obedience to all
the laws and ordinances of it. By this let it appear that Christ's
kingdom is come, let God's will be done; and by this let is appear that
it is come as a kingdom of heaven, let it introduce a heaven upon earth.
We make Christ but a titular Prince, if we call him King, and do not do
his will: having prayed that he may rule us, we pray that we may in
every thing be ruled by him. Observe, (1.) The thing prayed for, thy
will be done; "Lord, do what thou pleasest with me and mine; [Sa1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#018.md). I refer myself to thee, and am
well satisfied that all thy counsel concerning me should be performed."
In this sense Christ prayed, not my will, but thine be done. "Enable me
to do what is pleasing to thee; give me that grace that is necessary to
the right knowledge of thy will, and an acceptable obedience to it. Let
thy will be done conscientiously by me and others, not our own will, the
will of the flesh, or the mind, not the will of men ([Pe1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#002).md), much less Satan's will ([Joh
8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044).md), that we may neither displease
God in any thing we do (ut nihil nostrum displiceat Deo), nor be
displeased at any thing God does" (ut nihil Dei displiceat nobis). (2.)
The pattern of it, that it might be done on earth, in this place of our
trial and probation (where our work must be done, or it never will be
done), as it is done in heaven, that place of rest and joy. We pray that
earth may be made more like heaven by the observance of God's will (this
earth, which, through the prevalency of Satan's will, has become so near
akin to hell), and that saints may be made more like the holy angels in
their devotion and obedience. We are on earth, blessed be God, not yet
under the earth; we pray for the living only, not for the dead that have
gone down into silence.

4\. Give us this day our daily bread. Because our natural being is
necessary to our spiritual well-being in this world, therefore, after
the things of God's glory, kingdom, and will, we pray for the necessary
supports and comforts of this present life, which are the gifts of God,
and must be asked of him, Ton arton epiousion - Bread for the day
approaching, for all the remainder of our lives. Bread for the time to
come, or bread for our being and subsistence, that which is agreeable to
our condition in the world ([Pro
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#008).md), food convenient for us and our
families, according to our rank and station.

Every word here has a lesson in it: (1.) We ask for bread; that teaches
us sobriety and temperance; we ask for bread, not dainties, not
superfluities; that which is wholesome, though it be not nice. (2.) We
ask for our bread; that teaches us honesty and industry: we do not ask
for the bread out of other people's mouths, not the bread of deceit
([Pro 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#017).md), not the brad of idleness
([Pro 31:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#027).md), but the bread honestly
gotten. (3.) We ask for our daily bread; which teaches us not to take
thought for the morrow ([Mat 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#034).md),
but constantly to depend upon divine Providence, as those that live from
hand to mouth. (4.) We beg of God to give it us, not sell it us, nor
lend it us, but give it. The greatest of men must be beholden to the
mercy of God for their daily bread, (5.) We pray, "Give it to us; not to
me only, but to others in common with me." This teaches us charity, and
a compassionate concern for the poor and needy. It intimates also, that
we ought to pray with our families; we and our households eat together,
and therefore ought to pray together. (6.) We pray that God would give
us this day; which teaches us to renew the desire of our souls toward
God, as the wants of our bodies are renewed; as duly as the day comes,
we must pray to our heavenly Father, and reckon we could as well go a
day without meat, as without prayer.

5\. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors, This is
connected with the former; and forgive, intimating, that unless our sins
be pardoned, we can have no comfort in life, or the supports of it. Our
daily bread does but feed us as lambs for the slaughter, if our sins be
not pardoned. It intimates, likewise, that we must pray for daily
pardon, as duly as we pray for daily bread. He that is washed, needeth
to wash his feet. Here we have,

(1.) A petition; Father in heaven forgive us our debts, our debts to
thee. Note, \[1.\] Our sins are our debts; there is a debt of duty,
which, as creatures, we owe to our Creator; we do not pray to be
discharged from that, but upon the non-payment of that there arises a
debt of punishment; in default of obedience to the will of God, we
become obnoxious to the wrath of God; and for not observing the precept
of the law, we stand obliged to the penalty. A debtor is liable to
process, so are we; a malefactor is a debtor to the law, so are we.
\[2.\] Our hearts' desire and prayer to our heavenly Father every day
should be, that he would forgive us our debts; that the obligation to
punishment may be cancelled and vacated, that we may not come into
condemnation; that we may be discharged, and have the comfort of it. In
suing out the pardon of our sins, the great plea we have to rely upon is
the satisfaction that was made to the justice of God for the sin of man,
by the dying of the Lord Jesus our Surety, or rather Bail to the action,
that undertook our discharge.

(2.) An argument to enforce this petition; as we forgive our debtors.
This is not a plea of merit, but a plea of grace. Note, Those that come
to God for the forgiveness of their sins against him, must make
conscience of forgiving those who have offended them, else they curse
themselves when they say the Lord's prayer. Our duty is to forgive our
debtors; as to debts of money, we must not be rigorous and severe in
exacting them from those that cannot pay them without ruining themselves
and their families; but this means debt of injury; our debtors are those
that trespass against us, that smite us ([Mat
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039.md), [Mat
5:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#040).md), and in strictness of law, might
be prosecuted for it; we must forbear, and forgive, and forget the
affronts put upon us, and the wrongs done us; and this is a moral
qualification for pardon and peace; it encourages to hope, that God will
forgive us; for if there be in us this gracious disposition, it is
wrought of God, and therefore is a perfection eminently and
transcendently in himself; it will be an evidence to us that he has
forgiven us, having wrought in us the condition of forgiveness.

6\. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. This
petition is expressed,

(1.) Negatively: Lead us not into temptation. Having prayed that the
guilt of sin may be removed, we pray, as it is fit, that we may never
return again to folly, that we may not be tempted to it. It is not as if
God tempted any to sin; but, "Lord, do not let Satan loose upon us;
chain up that roaring lion, for he is subtle and spiteful; Lord, do not
leave us to ourselves ([Psa 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#013).md),
for we are very weak; Lord, do not lay stumbling-blocks and snares
before us, nor put us into circumstances that may be an occasion of
falling." Temptations are to be prayed against, both because of the
discomfort and trouble of them, and because of the danger we are in of
being overcome by them, and the guilt and grief that then follow.

(2.) Positively: But deliver us from evil; apo tou ponērou - from the
evil one, the devil, the tempter; "keep us, that either we may not be
assaulted by him, or we may not be overcome by those assaults:" Or from
the evil thing, sin, the worst of evils; an evil, an only evil; that
evil thing which God hates, and which Satan tempts men to and destroys
them by. "Lord, deliver us from the evil of the world, the corruption
that is in the world through lust; from the evil of every condition in
the world; from the evil of death; from the sting of death, which is
sin: deliver us from ourselves, from our own evil hearts: deliver us
from evil men, that they may not be a snare to us, nor we a prey to
them."

III\. The conclusion: For thine is the kingdom, and the power and the
glory, for ever. Amen. Some refer this to David's doxology, [Ch1
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#011.md). Thine, O Lord, is the
greatness. It is,

1\. A form of plea to enforce the foregoing petitions. It is our duty to
plead with God in prayer, to fill our mouth with arguments ([Job
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#004).md) not to move God, but to affect
ourselves; to encourage the faith, to excite our fervency, and to
evidence both. Now the best pleas in prayer are those that are taken
from God himself, and from that which he has made known of himself. We
must wrestle with God in his own strength, both as to the nature of our
pleas and the urging of them. The plea here has special reference to the
first three petitions; "Father in heaven, thy kingdom come, for thine is
the kingdom; thy will be done, for thine is the power; hallowed be thy
name, for thine is the glory." And as to our own particular errands,
these are encouraging: "Thine is the kingdom; thou hast the government
of the world, and the protection of the saints, thy willing subjects in
it;" God gives and saves like a king. "Thine is the power, to maintain
and support that kingdom, and to make good all thine engagements to thy
people." Thine is the glory, as the end of all that which is given to,
and done for, the saints, in answer to their prayers; for their praise
waiteth for him. This is matter of comfort and holy confidence in
prayer.

2\. It is a form of praise and thanksgiving. The best pleading with God
is praising of him; it is the way to obtain further mercy, as it
qualifies us to receive it. In all our addresses to God, it is fit that
praise should have a considerable share, for praise becometh the saints;
they are to be our God for a name and for a praise. It is just and
equal; we praise God, and give him glory, not because he needs it - he
is praised by a world of angels, but because he deserves it; and it is
our duty to give him glory, in compliance with his design in revealing
himself to us. Praise is the work and happiness of heaven; and all that
would go to heaven hereafter, must begin their heaven now. Observe, how
full this doxology is, The kingdom, and the power, and the glory, it is
all thine. Note, It becomes us to be copious in praising God. A true
saint never thinks he can speak honourably enough of God: here there
should be a gracious fluency, and this for ever. Ascribing glory to God
for ever, intimates an acknowledgement, that it is eternally due, and an
earnest desire to be eternally doing it, with angels and saints above,
[Psa 71:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#014.md).

Lastly, To all this we are taught to affix our Amen, so be it. God's
Amen is a grant; his fiat is, it shall be so; our Amen is only a summary
desire; our fiat is, let it be so: it is in the token of our desire and
assurance to be heard, that we say Amen. Amen refers to every petition
going before, and thus, in compassion to our infirmities, we are taught
to knit up the whole in one word, and so to gather up, in the general,
what we have lost and let slip in the particulars. It is good to
conclude religious duties with some warmth and vigour, that we may go
from them with a sweet savour upon our spirits. It was of old the
practice of good people to say, Amen, audibly at the end of every
prayer, and it is a commendable practice, provided it be done with
understanding, as the apostle directs ([Co1
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#016).md), and uprightly, with life and
liveliness, and inward expressions, answerable to that outward
expression of desire and confidence.

Most of the petitions in the Lord's prayer had been commonly used by the
Jews in their devotions, or words to the same effect: but that clause in
the fifth petition, As we forgive our debtors, was perfectly new, and
therefore our Saviour here shows for what reason he added it, not with
any personal reflection upon the peevishness, litigiousness, and ill
nature of the men of that generation, though there was cause enough for
it, but only from the necessity and importance of the thing itself. God,
in forgiving us, has a peculiar respect to our forgiving those that have
injured us; and therefore, when we pray for pardon, we must mention our
making conscience of that duty, not only to remind ourselves of it, but
to bind ourselves to it. See that parable, [Mat
18:23-35](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#023.md). Selfish nature is loth to
comply with this, and therefore it is here inculcated, [Mat
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#014.md), [Mat
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#015.md).

1\. In a promise. If ye forgive, your heavenly Father will also forgive.
Not as if this were the only condition required; there must be
repentance and faith, and new obedience; but as where other graces are
in truth, there will be this, so this will be a good evidence of the
sincerity of our other graces. He that relents toward his brother,
thereby shows that he repents toward his God. Those which in the prayer
are called debts, are here called trespasses, debts of injury, wrongs
done to us in our bodies, goods, or reputation: trespasses is an
extenuating term for offences, paraptōmata - stumbles, slips, falls.
Note, It is a good evidence, and a good help of our forgiving others, to
call the injuries done us by a mollifying, excusing name. Call them not
treasons, but trespasses; not wilful injuries, but casual
inadvertencies; peradventure it was an oversight ([Gen
43:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#012).md), therefore make the best of it.
We must forgive, as we hope to be forgiven; and therefore must not only
bear no malice, nor mediate revenge, but must not upbraid our brother
with the injuries he has done us, nor rejoice in any hurt that befalls
him, but must be ready to help him and do him good, and if he repent and
desire to be friends again, we must be free and familiar with him, as
before.

2\. In a threatening. "But if you forgive not those that have injured
you, that is a bad sign you have not the other requisite conditions, but
are altogether unqualified for pardon: and therefore your Father, whom
you call Father, and who, as a father, offers you his grace upon
reasonable terms, will nevertheless not forgive you. And if other grace
be sincere, and yet you be defective greatly in forgiving, you cannot
expect the comfort of your pardon, but to have your spirit brought down
by some affliction or other to comply with this duty." Note, Those who
would have found mercy with God must show mercy to their brethren; no
can we expect that he should stretch out the hands of his favour to us,
unless we lift up to him pure hands, without wrath, [Ti1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008.md). If we pray in anger, we have
reason to fear God will answer in anger. It has been said, Prayers made
in wrath are written in gall. What reason is it that God should forgive
us the talents we are indebted to him, if we forgive not our brethren
the pence they are indebted to us? Christ came into the world as the
great Peace-Maker, and not only to reconcile us to God, but one to
another, and in this we must comply with him. It is great presumption
and of dangerous consequence, for any to make a light matter of that
which Christ here lays such a stress upon. Men's passions shall not
frustrate God's word.

[Matthew 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#016.md)

We are here cautioned against hypocrisy in fasting, as before in
almsgiving, and in prayer.

I. It is here supposed that religious fasting is a duty required of the
disciples of Christ, when God, in his providence, calls to it, and when
the case of their own souls upon any account requires it; when the
bridegroom is taken away, then shall they fast, [Mat
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#015.md). Fasting is here put last,
because it is not so much a duty for its own sake, as a means to dispose
us for other duties. Prayer comes in between almsgiving and fasting, as
being the life and soul of both. Christ here speaks especially of
private fasts, such as particular persons prescribe to themselves, as
free-will offerings, commonly used among the pious Jews; some fasted one
day, some two, every week; others seldomer, as they saw cause. On those
days they did not eat till sun-set, and then very sparingly. It was not
the Pharisee's fasting twice in the week, but his boasting of it, that
Christ condemned, [Luk 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#012.md). It is a
laudable practice, and we have reason to lament it, that is so generally
neglected among Christians. Anna was much in fasting, [Luk
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#037.md). Cornelius fasted and prayed,
[Act 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#030.md). The primitive Christians
were much in it, see [Act 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#003.md); [Act
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023.md). Private fasting is supposed,
[Co1 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#005.md). It is an act of self-denial,
and mortification of the flesh, a holy revenge upon ourselves, and
humiliation under the hand of God. The most grown Christians must hereby
own, they are so far from having any thing to be proud of, that they are
unworthy of their daily bread. It is a means to curb the flesh and the
desires of it, and to make us more lively in religious exercises, as
fulness of bread is apt to make us drowsy. Paul was in fastings often,
and so he kept under this body, and brought it into subjection.

II\. We are cautioned not to do this as the hypocrites did it, lest we
lose the reward of it; and the more difficulty attends the duty, the
greater loss it is to lose the reward of it.

Now, 1. The hypocrites pretended fasting, when there was nothing of that
contrition or humiliation of soul in them, which is the life and soul of
the duty. Theirs were mock-fasts, the show and shadow without the
substance; they took on them to be more humbled than really they were,
and so endeavored to put a cheat upon God, than which they could not put
a greater affront upon him. The fast that God has chosen, is a day to
afflict the soul, not to hang down the head like a bulrush, nor for a
man to spread sackcloth and ashes under him; we are quite mistaken if we
call this a fast, [Isa 58:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#005.md). Bodily
exercise, if that be all, profits little, since that is not fasting to
God, even to him.

2\. They proclaimed their fasting, and managed it so that all who saw
them might take notice that it was a fasting-day with them. Even on
these days they appeared in the streets, whereas they should have been
in their closets; and the affected a downcast look, a melancholy
countenance, a slow and solemn pace; and perfectly disfigured
themselves, that men might see how often they fasted, and might extol
them as devout, mortified men. Note, It is sad that men, who have, in
some measure, mastered their pleasure, which is sensual wickedness,
should be ruined by their pride, which is spiritual wickedness, and no
less dangerous. Here also they have their reward, that praise and
applause of men which they court and covet so much; they have it, and it
is their all.

III\. We are directed how to manage a private fast; we must keep it in
private, [Mat 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#017.md), [Mat
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#018.md). He does not tell us how often we
must fast; circumstances vary, and wisdom is profitable therein to
direct; the Spirit in the word has left that to the Spirit in the heart;
but take this for a rule, whenever you undertake this duty, study
therein to approve yourselves to God, and not to recommend yourselves to
the good opinion of men; humility must evermore attend upon our
humiliation. Christ does not direct to abate any thing of the reality of
the fast; he does not say,"take a little meat, or a little drink, or a
little cordial;" no, "let the body suffer, but lay aside the show and
appearance of it; appear with thy ordinary countenance, guise, and
dress; and while thou deniest thyself thy bodily refreshments, do it so
as that it may not be taken notice of, no, not by those that are nearest
to thee; look pleasant, anoint thine head and wash thy face, as thou
dost on ordinary days, on purpose to conceal thy devotion; and thou
shalt be no loser in the praise of it at last; for though it be not of
men, it shall be of God." Fasting is the humbling of the soul ([Psa
35:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#013).md), that is the inside of the
duty; let that therefore be thy principal care, and as to the outside of
it, covet not to let it be seen. If we be sincere in our solemn fasts,
and humble, and trust God's omniscience for our witness, and his
goodness for our reward, we shall find, both that he did see in secret,
and will reward openly. Religious fasts, if rightly kept, will shortly
be recompensed with an everlasting feast. Our acceptance with God in our
private fasts should make us dead, both to the applause of men (we must
not do the duty in hopes of this), and to the censures of men too (we
must not decline the duty for fear of them). David's fasting was turned
to his reproach, [Psa 69:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#010.md); and yet,
[Psa 69:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#013.md), As for me, let them say
what they will of me, my prayer is unto thee in an acceptable time.

[Matthew 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 6:19</span></span>

Worldly-mindedness is as common and as fatal a symptom of hypocrisy as
any other, for by no sin can Satan have a surer and faster hold of the
soul, under the cloak of a visible and passable profession of religion,
than by this; and therefore Christ, having warned us against coveting
the praise of men, proceeds next to warn us against coveting the wealth
of the world; in this also we must take heed, lest we be as the
hypocrites are, and do as they do: the fundamental error that they are
guilty of is, that they choose the world for their reward; we must
therefore take heed of hypocrisy and worldly-mindedness, in the choice
we make of our treasure, our end, and our masters.

I. In choosing the treasure we lay up. Something or other every man has
which he makes his treasure, his portion, which his heart is upon, to
which he carries all he can get, and which he depends upon for futurity.
It is that good, that chief good, which Solomon speaks of with such an
emphasis, [Ecc 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#003.md). Something the soul
will have, which it looks upon as the best thing, which it has a
complacency and confidence in above other things. Now Christ designs not
to deprive us of our treasure, but to direct us in the choice of it; and
here we have,

1\. A good caution against making the things that are seen, that are
temporal, our best things, and placing our happiness in them. Lay not up
for yourselves treasures upon earth. Christ's disciples had left all to
follow him, let them still keep in the same good mind. A treasure is an
abundance of something that is in itself, at least in our opinion,
precious and valuable, and likely to stand us in stead hereafter. Now we
must not lay up our treasures on earth, that is, (1.) We must not count
these things the best things, nor the most valuable in themselves, nor
the most serviceable to us: we must not call them glory, as Laban's sons
did, but see and own that they have no glory in comparison with the
glory that excelleth. (2.) We must not covet an abundance of these
things, nor be still grasping at more and more of them, and adding to
them, as men do to that which is their treasure, as never knowing when
we have enough. (3.) We must not confide in them for futurity, to be our
security and supply in time to come; we must not say to the gold, Thou
art my hope. (4.) We must not content ourselves with them, as all we
need or desire: we must be content with a little for our passage, but
not with all for our portion. These things must not be made our
consolation ([Luk 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024).md), our good
things, [Luk 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#025.md). Let us consider we
are laying up, not for our posterity in this world, but for ourselves in
the other world. We are put to our choice, and made in a manner our own
carvers; that is ours which we lay up for ourselves. It concerns thee to
choose wisely, for thou art choosing for thyself, and shalt have as thou
choosest. If we know and consider ourselves what we are, what we are
made for, how large our capacities are, and how long our continuance,
and that our souls are ourselves, we shall see it is foolish thing to
lay up our treasures on earth.

2\. Here is a good reason given why we should not look upon any thing on
earth as our treasure, because it is liable to loss and decay: (1.) From
corruption within. That which is treasure upon earth moth and rust do
corrupt. If the treasure be laid up in fine clothes, the moth frets
them, and they are gone and spoiled insensibly, when we thought them
most securely laid up. If it be in corn or other eatables, as his was
who had his barns full ([Luk 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#016.md),
[Luk 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#017)), rust (so we read it.md)
corrupts that: brōsis - eating, eating by men, for as goods are
increased they are increased that eat them ([Ecc
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#011).md); eating by mice or other vermin;
manna itself bred worms; or it grows mouldy and musty, is struck, or
smutted, or blasted; fruits soon rot. Or, if we understand it of silver
and gold, they tarnish and canker; they grow less with using, and grow
worse with keeping ([Jam 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#002.md), [Jam
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#003).md); the rust and the moth breed in
the metal itself and in the garment itself. Note, Worldly riches have in
themselves a principal of corruption and decay; they wither of
themselves, and make themselves wings. (2.) From violence without.
Thieves break through and steal. Every hand of violence will be aiming
at the house where treasure is laid up; nor can any thing be laid up so
safe, but we may be spoiled of it. Numquam ego fortunae credidi, etiam
si videretur pacem agere; omnia illa quae in me indulgentissime
conferebat, pecuniam, honores, gloriam, eo loco posui, unde posset ea,
since metu meo, repetere - I never reposed confidence in fortune, even
if she seemed propitious: whatever were the favours which her bounty
bestowed, whether wealth, honours, or glory, I so disposed of them, that
it was in her power to recall them without occasioning me any alarm.
Seneca. Consol. ad Helv. It is folly to make that our treasure which we
may so easily be robbed of.

3\. Good counsel, to make the joys and glories of the other world, those
things not seen that are eternal, our best things, and to place our
happiness in them. Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven. Note, (1.)
There are treasures in heaven, as sure as there are on this earth; and
those in heaven are the only true treasures, the riches and glories and
pleasures that are at God's right hand, which those that are sanctified
truly arrive at, when they come to be sanctified perfectly. (2.) It is
our wisdom to lay up our treasure in those treasures; to give all
diligence to make sure our title to eternal life through Jesus Christ,
and to depend upon that as our happiness, and look upon all things here
below with a holy contempt, as not worthy to be compared with it. We
must firmly believe there is such a happiness, and resolve to be content
with that, and to be content with nothing short of it. If we thus make
those treasures ours, they are laid up, and we may trust God to keep
them safe for us; thither let us then refer all our designs, and extend
all our desires; thither let us send before our best efforts and best
affections. Let us not burthen ourselves with the cash of this world,
which will but load and defile us, and be liable to sink us, but lay up
in store good securities. The promises are bills of exchange, by which
all true believers return their treasure to heaven, payable in the
future state: and thus we make that sure that will be made sure. (3.) It
is a great encouragement to us to lay up our treasure in heaven, that
there it is safe; it will not decay of itself, no moth nor rust will
corrupt it; nor can we be by force or fraud deprived of it; thieves do
not break through and steal. It is a happiness above and beyond the
changes and chances of time, an inheritance incorruptible.

4\. A good reason why we should thus choose, and an evidence that we
have done so ([Mat 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#021).md), Where your
treasure is, on earth or in heaven, there will you heart be. We are
therefore concerned to be right and wise in the choice of our treasure,
because the temper of our minds, and consequently the tenor of our
lives, will be accordingly either carnal or spiritual, earthly or
heavenly. The heart follows the treasure, as the needle follows the
loadstone, or the sunflower the sun. Where the treasure is there the
value and esteem are, there the love and affection are ([Col
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#002).md), that way the desires and
pursuits go, thitherward the aims and intents are levelled, and all is
done with that in view. Where the treasure is, there our cares and fears
are, lest we come short of it; about that we are most solicitous; there
our hope and trust are ([Pro 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010.md),
[Pro 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#011).md); there our joys and
delights will be ([Psa 119:111](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#111).md); and
there our thoughts will be, there the inward thought will be, the first
thought, the free thought, the fixed thought, the frequent, the familiar
thought. The heart is God's due ([Pro
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#026).md), and that he may have it, our
treasure must be laid up with him, and then our souls will be lifted up
to him.

This direction about laying up our treasure, may very fitly be applied
to the foregoing caution, of not doing what we do in religion to be seen
of men. Our treasure is our alms, prayers, and fastings, and the reward
of them; if we have done these only to gain the applause of men, we have
laid up this treasure on earth, have lodged it in the hands of men, and
must never expect to hear any further of it. Now it is folly to do this,
for the praise of men we covet so much is liable to corruption: it will
soon be rusted, and moth-eaten, and tarnished; a little folly, like a
dead fly, will spoil it all, [Ecc
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#001.md). Slander and calumny are thieves
that break through and steal it away, and so we lose all the treasure of
our performances; we have run in vain, and laboured in vain, because we
misplaced our intentions in doing of them. Hypocritical services lay up
nothing in heaven ([Isa 58:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#003).md); the
gain of them is gone, when the soul is called for, [Job
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#008.md). But if we have prayed and fasted
and given alms in truth and uprightness, with an eye to God and to his
acceptance, and have approved ourselves to him therein, we have laid up
that treasure in heaven; a book of remembrance is written there ([Mal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#016).md), and being there recorded, they
shall be there rewarded, and we shall meet them again with comfort on
the other side death and the grave. Hypocrites are written in the earth
([Jer 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013).md), but God's faithful ones
have their names written in heaven, [Luk
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#020.md). Acceptance with God is treasure
in heaven, which can neither be corrupted nor stolen. His well done
shall stand for ever; and if we have thus laid up our treasure with him,
with him our hearts will be; and where can they be better?

II\. We must take heed of hypocrisy and worldly-mindedness in choosing
the end we look at. Our concern as to this is represented by two sorts
of eyes which men have, a single eye and an evil eye, [Mat
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#022.md), [Mat
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#023.md). The expressions here are
somewhat dark because concise; we shall therefore take them in some
variety of interpretation. The light of the body is the eye, that is
plain; the eye is discovering and directing; the light of the world
would avail us little without this light of the body; it is the light of
the eye that rejoiceth the heart ([Pro
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#030).md), but what is that which is here
compared to the eye in the body.

1\. The eye, that is, the heart (so some) if that be single - haplous -
free and bountiful (so the word is frequently rendered, as [Rom
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008.md); [Co2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#002.md), [Co2
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#011.md), [Co2
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#013.md); [Jam
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005.md), and we read of a bountiful eye,
[Pro 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#009).md). If the heart be liberally
affected and stand inclined to goodness and charity, it will direct the
man to Christian actions, the whole conversation will be full of light,
full of evidences and instances of true Christianity, that pure religion
and undefiled before God and the Father ([Jam
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027).md), full of light, of good works,
which are our light shining before men; but if the heart be evil,
covetous, and hard, and envious, griping and grudging (such a temper of
mind is often expressed by an evil eye, [Mat
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#015.md); [Mar
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022.md); [Pro
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#006.md), [Pro
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#007).md), the body will be full of
darkness, the whole conversation will be heathenish and unchristian. The
instruments of the churl are and always will be evil, but the liberal
deviseth liberal things, [Isa 32:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#005.md).
If the light that is in us, those affections which should guide us to
that which is good, be darkness, if these be corrupt and worldly, if
there be not so much as good nature in a man, not so much as a kind
disposition, how great is the corruption of a man, and the darkness in
which he sits! This sense seems to agree with the context; we must lay
up treasure in heaven by liberality in giving alms, and that not
grudgingly but with cheerfulness, [Luk
12:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#033.md); [Co2
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007.md). But these words in the parallel
place do not come in upon any such occasion, [Luk
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#034.md), and therefore the coherence
here does not determine that to be the sense of them.

2\. The eye, that is, the understanding (so some); the practical
judgment, the conscience, which is to the other faculties of the soul,
as the eye is to the body, to guide and direct their motions; now if
this eye be single, if it make a true and right judgment, and discern
things that differ, especially in the great concern of laying up the
treasure so as to choose aright in that, it will rightly guide the
affections and actions, which will all be full of the light of grace and
comfort; but if this be evil and corrupt, and instead of leading the
inferior powers, is led, and bribed, and biassed by them, if this be
erroneous and misinformed, the heart and life must needs be full of
darkness, and the whole conversation corrupt. They that will not
understand, are said to walk on in darkness, [Psa
82:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#005.md). It is sad when the spirit of a
man, that should be the candle of the Lord, is an ignis fatuus: when the
leaders of the people, the leaders of the faculties, cause them to err,
for then they that are led of them are destroyed, [Isa
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#016.md). An error in the practical
judgment is fatal, it is that which calls evil good and good evil ([Isa
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#020).md); therefore it concerns us to
understand things aright, to get our eyes anointed with eye-salve.

3\. The eye, that is, the aims and intentions; by the eye we set our end
before us, the mark we shoot at, the place we go to, we keep that in
view, and direct our motion accordingly; in every thing we do in
religion; there is something or other that we have in our eye; now if
our eye be single, if we aim honestly, fix right ends, and move rightly
towards them, if we aim purely and only at the glory of God, seek his
honor and favour, and direct all entirely to him, then the eye is
single; Paul's was so when he said, To me to live is Christ; and if we
be right here, the whole body will be full of light, all the actions
will be regular and gracious, pleasing to God and comfortable to
ourselves; but if this eye be evil, if, instead of aiming only at the
glory of God, and our acceptance with him, we look aside at the applause
of men, and while we profess to honour God, contrive to honour
ourselves, and seek our own things under colour of seeking the things of
Christ, this spoils all, the whole conversation will be perverse and
unsteady, and the foundations being thus out of course, there can be
nothing but confusion and every evil work in the superstructure. Draw
the lines from the circumference to any other point but the centre, and
they will cross. If the light that is in thee be not only dim, but
darkness itself, it is a fundamental error, and destructive to all that
follows. The end specifies the action. It is of the last importance in
religion, that we be right in our aims, and make eternal things, not
temporal, our scope, [Co2 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#018.md). The
hypocrite is like the waterman, that looks one way and rows another; the
true Christian like the traveller, that has his journey's end in his
eye. The hypocrite soars like the kite, with his eye upon the prey
below, which he is ready to come down to when he has a fair opportunity;
the true Christian soars like the lark, higher and higher, forgetting
the things that are beneath.

III\. We must take heed of hypocrisy and worldly-mindedness in choosing
the master we serve, [Mat 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024.md). No man
can serve two masters. Serving two masters is contrary to the single
eye; for the eye will be to the master's hand, [Psa
123:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#001.md), [Psa
123:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#002.md). Our Lord Jesus here exposes the
cheat which those put upon their own souls, who think to divide between
God and the world, to have a treasure on earth, and a treasure in heaven
too, to please God and please men too. Why not? says the hypocrite; it
is good to have two strings to one's bow. They hope to make their
religion serve their secular interest, and so turn to account both ways.
The pretending mother was for dividing the child; the Samaritans will
compound between God and idols. No, says Christ, this will not do; it is
but a supposition that gain is godliness, [Ti1
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#005.md). Here is,

1\. A general maxim laid down; it is likely it was a proverb among the
Jews, No man can serve two masters, much less two gods; for their
commands will some time or other cross or contradict one another, and
their occasions interfere. While two masters go together, a servant may
follow them both; but when they part, you will see to which he belongs;
he cannot love, and observe, and cleave to both as he should. If to the
one, not to the other; either this or that must be comparatively hated
and despised. This truth is plain enough in common cases.

2\. The application of it to the business in hand. Ye cannot serve God
and Mammon. Mammon is a Syriac word, that signifies gain; so that
whatever in this world is, or is accounted by us to be, gain ([Phi
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#007).md), is mammon. Whatever is in the
world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of
life, is mammon. To some their belly is their mammon, and they serve
that ([Phi 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019).md); to others their
ease, their sleep, their sports and pastimes, are their mammon ([Pro
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#009).md); to others worldly riches ([Jam
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#013).md); to others honours and
preferments; the praise and applause of men was the Pharisees' mammon;
in a word, self, the unity in which the world's trinity centres,
sensual, secular self, is the mammon which cannot be served in
conjunction with God; for if it be served, it is in competition with him
and in contradiction to him. He does not say, We must not or we should
not, but we cannot serve God and Mammon; we cannot love both ([Jo1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#015.md); [Jam
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#004).md); or hold to both, or hold by both
in observance, obedience, attendance, trust, and dependence, for they
are contrary the one to the other. God says, "My son, give me thy
heart." Mammon says, "No, give it me." God says, "Be content with such
things as ye have." Mammon says, "Grasp at all that ever thou canst.
Rem, rem, quocunque modo rem - Money, money; by fair means or by foul,
money." God says, "Defraud not, never lie, be honest and just in all thy
dealings." Mammon says "Cheat thine own Father, if thou canst gain by
it." God says, "Be charitable." Mammon says, "Hold thy own: this giving
undoes us all." God says, "Be careful for nothing." Mammon says, "Be
careful for every thing." God says, "Keep holy thy sabbath-day." Mammon
says, "Make use of that day as well as any other for the world." Thus
inconsistent are the commands of God and Mammon, so that we cannot serve
both. Let us not then halt between God and Baal, but choose ye this day
whom ye will serve, and abide by our choice.

[Matthew 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 6:25</span></span>

There is scarcely any one sin against which our Lord Jesus more largely
and earnestly warns his disciples, or against which he arms them with
more variety of arguments, than the sin of disquieting, distracting,
distrustful cares about the things of life, which are a bad sign that
both the treasure and the heart are on the earth; and therefore he thus
largely insists upon it. Here is,

I. The prohibition laid down. It is the counsel and command of the Lord
Jesus, that we take no thought about the things of this world; I say
unto you. He says it as our Lawgiver, and the Sovereign of our hearts;
he says it as our Comforter, and the Helper of our joy. What is it that
he says? It is this, and he that hath ears to hear, let him hear it.
Take no thought for your life, nor yet for your body ([Mat
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025).md). Take no thought, saying, What
shall we eat? ([Mat 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#031).md) and again
([Mat 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#034).md), Take no thought, mē
merimnate - Be not in care. As against hypocrisy, so against worldly
cares, the caution is thrice repeated, and yet no vain repetition:
precept must be upon precept, and line upon line, to the same purport,
and all little enough; it is a sin which doth so easily beset us. It
intimates how pleasing it is to Christ, and of how much concern it is to
ourselves, that we should live without carefulness. It is the repeated
command of the Lord Jesus to his disciples, that they should not divide
and pull in pieces their own minds with care about the world. There is a
thought concerning the things of this life, which is not only lawful,
but duty, such as is commended in the virtuous woman. See [Pro
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#023.md). The word is used concerning
Paul's care of the churches, and Timothy's care for the state of souls,
[Co2 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#028.md); [Phi
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#020.md).

But the thought here forbidden is, 1. A disquieting, tormenting thought,
which hurries the mind hither and thither, and hangs it in suspense;
which disturbs our joy in God, and is a damp upon our hope in him; which
breaks the sleep, and hinders our enjoyment of ourselves, of our
friends, and of what God has given us. 2. A distrustful, unbelieving
thought. God has promised to provide for those that are his all things
needful for life as well as godliness, the life that now is, food and a
covering: not dainties, but necessaries. He never said, "They shall be
feasted," but, "Verily, they shall be fed." Now an inordinate care for
time to come, and fear of wanting those supplies, spring from a
disbelief of these promises, and of the wisdom and goodness of Divine
Providence; and that is the evil of it. As to present sustenance, we may
and must use lawful means to get it, else we tempt God; we must be
diligent in our callings, and prudent in proportioning our expenses to
what we have, and we must pray for daily bread; and if all other means
fail, we may and must ask relief of those that are able to give it. He
was none of the best of men that said, To beg I am ashamed ([Luk
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#003).md); as he was, who ([Luk
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#021).md) desired to be fed with the
crumbs; but for the future, we must cast our care upon God, and take no
thought, because it looks like a jealousy of God, who knows how to give
what we want when we know not now to get it. Let our souls dwell at ease
in him! This gracious carelessness is the same with that sleep which God
gives to his beloved, in opposition to the worldling's toil, [Psa
127:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#002.md). Observe the cautions here,

(1.) Take no thought for your life. Life is our greatest concern for
this world; All that a man has will he give for his life; yet take no
thought about it. \[1.\] Not about the continuance of it; refer it to
God to lengthen or shorten it as he pleases; my times are in thy hand,
and they are in a good hand. \[2.\] Not about the comforts of this life;
refer it to God to embitter or sweeten it as he pleases. We must not be
solicitous, no not about the necessary support of this life, food and
raiment; these God has promised, and therefore we may more confidently
expect; say not, What shall we eat? It is the language of one at a loss,
and almost despairing; whereas, though many good people have the
prospect of little, yet there are few but have present support.

(2.) Take no thought for the morrow, for the time to come. Be not
solicitous for the future, how you shall live next year, or when you are
old, or what you shall leave behind you. As we must not boast of
tomorrow, so we must not care for tomorrow, or the events of it.

II\. The reasons and arguments to enforce this prohibition. One would
think the command of Christ was enough to restrain us from this foolish
sin of disquieting, distrustful care, independently of the comfort of
our own souls, which is so nearly concerned; but to show how much the
heart of Christ is upon it, and what pleasures he takes in those that
hope in his mercy, the command is backed with the most powerful
arguments. If reason may but rule us, surely we shall ease ourselves of
these thorns. To free us from anxious thoughts, and to expel them,
Christ here suggests to us comforting thoughts, that we may be filled
with them. It will be worth while to take pains with our own hearts, to
argue them out of their disquieting cares, and to make ourselves ashamed
of them. They may be weakened by right reason, but it is by an active
faith only that they can be overcome. Consider then,

1\. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? [Mat
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025.md). Yes, no doubt it is; so he says
who had reason to understand the true value of present things, for he
made them, he supports them, and supports us by them; and the thing
speaks for itself. Note, (1.) Our life is a greater blessing than our
livelihood. It is true, life cannot subsist without a livelihood; but
the meat and raiment which are here represented as inferior to the life
and body are such as are for ornament and delight; for about such as are
for ornament ad delight; for about such we are apt to be solicitous.
Meat and raiment are in order to life, and the end is more noble and
excellent than the means. The daintiest food and finest raiment are from
the earth, but life from the breath of God. Life is the light of men;
meat is but the oil that feeds that light: so that the difference
between rich and poor is very inconsiderable, since, in the greatest
things, they stand on the same level, and differ only in the less. (2.)
This is an encouragement to us to trust God for food and raiment, and so
to ease ourselves of all perplexing cares about them. God has given us
life, and given us the body; it was an act of power, it was an act of
favour, it was done without our care: what cannot he do for us, who did
that? - what will he not? If we take care about our souls and eternity,
which are more than the body, and its life, we may leave it to God to
provide for us food and raiment, which are less. God has maintained our
lives hitherto; if sometimes with pulse and water, that has answered the
end; he has protected us and kept us alive. He that guards us against
the evils we are exposed to, will supply us with the good things we are
in need of. If he had been pleased to kill us, to starve us, he would
not so often have given his angels a charge concerning us to keep us.

2\. Behold the fowls of the air, and consider the lilies of the field.
Here is an argument taken from God's common providence toward the
inferior creatures, and their dependence, according to their capacities,
upon that providence. A fine pass fallen man has come to, that he must
be sent to school to the fowls of the air, and that they must teach him!
[Job 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#007.md), [Job
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#008.md).

(1.) Look upon the fowls, and learn to trust God for food ([Mat
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#026).md), and disquiet not yourselves
with thoughts what you shall eat.

\[1.\] Observe the providence of God concerning them. Look upon them,
and receive instruction. There are various sorts of fowls; they are
numerous, some of them ravenous, but they are all fed, and fed with food
convenient for them; it is rare that any of them perish for want of
food, even in winter, and there goes no little to feed them all the year
round. The fowls, as they are least serviceable to man, so they are
least within his care; men often feed upon them, but seldom feed them;
yet they are fed, we know not how, and some of them fed best in the
hardest weather; and it is your heavenly Father that feeds them; he
knows all the wild fowls of the mountains, better than you know the tame
ones at your own barn-door, [Psa
50:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#011.md). Not a sparrow lights to the
ground, to pick up a grain of corn, but by the providence of God, which
extends itself to the meanest creatures. But that which is especially
observed here is, that they are fed without any care or project of their
own; they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns. The ant
indeed does, and the bee, and they are set before us as examples of
prudence and industry; but the fowls of the air do not; they make no
provision for the future themselves, and yet every day, as duly as the
day comes, provision is made for them, and their eyes wait on God, that
great and good Housekeeper, who provides food for all flesh.

\[2.\] Improve this for your encouragement to trust in God. Are ye not
much better than they? Yes, certainly you are. Note, The heirs of heaven
are much better than the fowls of heaven; nobler and more excellent
beings, and, by faith, they soar higher; they are of a better nature and
nurture, wiser than the fowls of heaven ([Job
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#011).md): though the children of this
world, that know not the judgment of the Lord, are not so wise as the
stork, and the crane, and the swallow ([Jer
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#007).md), you are dearer to God, and
nearer, though they fly in the open firmament of heaven. He is their
Master and Lord, their Owner and Master; but besides all this, he is
your Father, and in his account ye are of more value than many sparrows;
you are his children, his first-born; now he that feeds his birds surely
will not starve his babes. They trust your Father's providence, and will
not you trust it? In dependence upon that, they are careless for the
morrow; and being so, they live the merriest lives of all creatures;
they sing among the branches ([Psa
104:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#012).md), and, to the best of their
power, they praise their Creator. If we were, by faith, as unconcerned
about the morrow as they are, we should sing as cheerfully as they do;
for it is worldly care that mars our mirth and damps our joy, and
silences our praise, as much as any thing.

(2.) Look upon the lilies, and learn to trust God for raiment. That is
another part of our care, what we shall put on; for decency, to cover
us; for defence, to keep us warm; yea, and, with many, for dignity and
ornament, to make them look great and fine; and so much concerned are
they for gaiety and variety in their clothing, that this care returns
almost as often as that for their daily bread. Now to ease us of this
care, let us consider the lilies of the field; not only look upon them
(every eyes does that with pleasure), but consider them. Note, There is
a great deal of good to be learned from what we see every day, if we
would but consider it, [Pro 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#006.md); [Pro
24:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#032.md).

\[1.\] Consider how frail the lilies are; they are the grass of the
field. Lilies, though distinguished by their colours, are still but
grass. Thus all flesh is grass: though some in the endowments of body
and mind are as lilies, much admired, still they are grass; the grass of
the field in nature and constitution; they stand upon the same level
with others. Man's days, at best, are as grass, as the flower of the
grass [Pe1 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#024.md). This grass today is,
and tomorrow is cast into the oven; in a little while the place that
knows us will know us no more. The grave is the oven into which we shall
be cast, and in which we shall be consumed as grass in the fire, [Psa
49:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014.md). This intimates a reason why we
should not take thought for the morrow, what we shall put on, because
perhaps, by tomorrow, we may have occasion for our grave-clothes.

\[2.\] Consider how free from care the lilies are: they toil not as men
do, to earn clothing; as servants, to earn their liveries; neither do
they spin, as women do, to make clothing. It does not follow that we
must therefore neglect, or do carelessly, the proper business of this
life; it is the praise of the virtuous woman, that she lays her hand to
the spindle, makes fine linen and sells it, [Pro
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#019.md), [Pro
31:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#024.md). Idleness tempts God, instead of
trusting him; but he that provides for inferior creatures, without their
labour, will much more provide for us, by blessing our labour, which he
has made our duty. And if we should, through sickness, be unable to toil
and spin, God can furnish us with what is necessary for us.

\[3.\] Consider how fair, how fine the lilies are; how they grow; what
they grow from. The root of the lily or tulip, as other bulbous roots,
is, in winter, lost and buried under ground, yet, when spring returns,
it appears, and starts up in a little time; hence it is promised to
God's Israel, that they should grow as the lily, [Hos
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#005.md). Consider what they grow to. Out
of that obscurity in a few weeks they come to be so very gay, that even
Solomon, in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of these. The array
of Solomon was very splendid and magnificent: he that had the peculiar
treasure of kings and provinces, and studiously affected pomp and
gallantry, doubtless had the richest clothing, and the best made up,
that could be got; especially when he appeared in his glory on high
days. And yet, let him dress himself as fine as he could, he comes far
short of the beauty of the lilies, and a bed of tulips outshines him.
Let us, therefore, be ambitious of the wisdom of Solomon, in which he
was outdone by none (wisdom to do our duty in our places), rather than
the glory of Solomon, in which he was outdone by the lilies. Knowledge
and grace are the perfection of man, not beauty, much less fine clothes.
Now God is here said thus to clothe the grass of the field. Note, All
the excellences of the creature flow from God, the Fountain and spring
of them. It was he that gave the horse his strength, and the lily its
beauty; every creature is in itself, as well as to us, what he makes it
to be.

\[4.\] Consider how instructive all this is to us, [Mat
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#030.md).

First, As to fine clothing, this teaches us not to care for it at all,
not to covet it, nor to be proud of it, not to make the putting on of
apparel our adorning, for after all our care in this the lilies will far
outdo us; we cannot dress so fine as they do, why then should we attempt
to vie with them? Their adorning will soon perish, and so will ours;
they fade - are today, and tomorrow are cast, as other rubbish, into the
oven; and the clothes we are proud of are wearing out, the gloss is soon
gone, the color fades, the shape goes out of fashion, or in awhile the
garment itself is worn out; such is man in all his pomp ([Isa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006.md), [Isa
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#007).md), especially rich men ([Jam
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#010).md); they fade away in their ways.

Secondly, As to necessary clothing; this teaches us to cast the care of
it upon God - Jehovah-jireh; trust him that clothes the lilies, to
provide for you what you shall put on. If he give such fine clothes to
the grass, much more will he give fitting clothes to his own children;
clothes that shall be warm upon them, not only when he quieteth the
earth with the south wind, but when he disquiets it with the north wind,
[Job 37:17](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#017.md). He shall much more clothe
you: for you are nobler creatures, of a more excellent being; if so he
clothe the short-lived grass, much more will he clothe you that are made
for immortality. Even the children of Nineveh are preferred before the
gourd ([Jon 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#010.md), [Jon
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#011).md), much more the sons of Zion,
that are in covenant with God. Observe the title he gives them ([Mat
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#030).md), O ye of little faith. This may
be taken, 1. As an encouragement to truth faith, though it be but weak;
it entitles us to the divine care, and a promise of suitable supply.
Great faith shall be commended, and shall procure great things, but
little faith shall not be rejected, even that shall procure food and
raiment. Sound believers shall be provided for, though they be not
strong believers. The babes in the family are fed and clothed, as well
as those that are grown up, and with a special care and tenderness; say
not, I am but a child, but a dry tree ([Isa
56:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#003.md), [Isa
56:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#005).md), for though poor and needy yet
the Lord thinketh on thee. Or, 2. It is rather a rebuke to weak faith,
though it be true, [Mat 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#031.md). It
intimates what is at the bottom of all our inordinate care and
thoughtfulness; it is owing to the weakness of our faith, and the
remains of unbelief in us. If we had but more faith, we should have less
care.

3\. Which of you, the wisest, the strongest of you, by taking thought,
can add one cubit to his stature? ([Mat
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#027).md) to his age, so some; but the
measure of a cubit denotes it to be meant of the stature, and the age at
longest is but a span, [Psa 39:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#005.md). Let
us consider, (1.) We did not arrive at the stature we are of by our own
care and thought, but by the providence of God. An infant of a span long
has grown up to be a man of six feet, and how was one cubit after
another added to his stature? not by his own forecast or contrivance; he
grew he knew not how, by the power and goodness of God. Now he that made
our bodies, and made them of such size, surely will take care to provide
for them. Note, God is to be acknowledged in the increase of our bodily
strength and stature, and to be trusted for all needful supplies,
because he has made it to appear, that he is mindful for the body. The
growing age is the thoughtless, careless age, yet we grow; and shall not
he who reared us to this, provide for us now we are reared? (2.) We
cannot alter the stature we are of, if we would: what a foolish and
ridiculous thing would it be for a man of low stature to perplex
himself, to break his sleep, and beat his brains, about it, and to be
continually taking thought how he might be a cubit higher; when, after
all, he knows he cannot effect it, and therefore he had better be
content and take it as it is! We are not all of a size, yet the
difference in stature between one and another is not material, nor of
any great account; a little man is ready to wish he were as tall as such
a one, but he knows it is to no purpose, and therefore does as well as
he can with it. Now as we do in reference to our bodily stature, so we
should do in reference to our worldly estate. \[1.\] We should not covet
an abundance of the wealth of this world, any more than we would covet
the addition of a cubit to one's stature, which is a great deal in a
man's height; it is enough to grow by inches; such an addition would but
make one unwieldy, and a burden to one's self. \[2.\] We must reconcile
ourselves to our state, as we do to our stature; we must set the
conveniences against the inconveniences, and so make a virtue of
necessity: what cannot be remedied must be made the best of. We cannot
alter the disposals of Providence, and therefore must acquiesce in them,
accommodate ourselves to them, and relieve ourselves, as well as we can,
against inconveniences, as Zaccheus against the inconvenience of his
stature, by climbing into the tree.

4\. After all these things do the Gentiles seek, [Mat
6:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#032.md). Thoughtfulness about the world
is a heathenish sin, and unbecoming Christians. The Gentiles seek these
things, because they know not better things; they are eager for this
world, because they are strangers to a better; they seek these things
with care and anxiety, because they are without God in the world, and
understand not his providence. They fear and worship their idols, but
know not how to trust them for deliverance and supply, and, therefore,
are themselves full of care; but it is a shame for Christians, who build
upon nobler principles, and profess a religion which teaches them not
only that there is a Providence, but that there are promises made to the
good of the life that now is, which teaches them a confidence in God and
a contempt of the world, and gives such reasons for both; it is a shame
for them to walk as Gentiles walk, and to fill their heads and hearts
with these things.

5\. Your heavenly Father knows ye have need of all these things; these
necessary things, food and raiment; he knows our wants better than we do
ourselves; though he be in heaven, and his children on earth, he
observes what the least and poorest of them has occasion for ([Rev
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#009).md), I know thy poverty. You think,
if such a good friend did not but know your wants and straits, you would
soon have relief: your God knows them; and he is your Father that loves
you and pities you, and is ready to help you; your heavenly Father, who
has wherewithal to supply all your needs: away, therefore, with all
disquieting thoughts and cares; go to thy Father; tell him, he knows
that thou has need of such and such things; he asks you, Children, have
you any meat? [Joh 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#005.md). Tell him
whether you have or have not. Though he knows our wants, he will know
them from us; and when we have opened them to him, let us cheerfully
refer ourselves to his wisdom, power, and goodness, for our supply.
Therefore, we should ease ourselves of the burthen of care, by casting
it upon God, because it is he that careth for us ([Pe1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#007).md), and what needs all this ado? If
he care, why should be care?

6\. Seek first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these
things shall be added unto you. [Mat
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033.md). Here is a double argument
against the sin of thoughtfulness; take no thought for your life, the
life of the body; for, (1.) You have greater and better things to take
thought about, the life of your soul, your eternal happiness; that is
the one thing needful ([Luk 10:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#042).md),
about which you should employ your thoughts, and which is commonly
neglected in those hearts wherein worldly cares have the ascendant. If
we were but more careful to please God, and to work out our own
salvation, we should be less solicitous to please ourselves, and work
out an estate in the world. Thoughtfulness for our souls in the most
effectual cure of thoughtfulness for the world. (2.) You have a surer
and easier, a safer and more compendious way to obtain the necessaries
of this life, than by carking, and caring, and fretting about them; and
that is, by seeking first the kingdom of God, and making religion your
business: say not that this is the way to starve, no, it is the way to
be well provided for, even in this world. Observe here,

\[1.\] The great duty required: it is the sum and substance of our whole
duty: "Seek first the kingdom of God, mind religion as your great and
principle concern." Our duty is to seek; to desire, pursue, and aim at
these things; it is a word that has in it much of the constitution of
the new covenant in favour of us; though we have not attained, but in
many things fail and come short, sincere seeking (a careful concern and
an earnest endeavor) is accepted. Now observe, First, The object of this
seeking; The kingdom of God, and his righteousness; we must mind heaven
as our end, and holiness as our way. "Seek the comforts of the kingdom
of grace and glory as your felicity. Aim at the kingdom of heaven; press
towards it; give diligence to make it sure; resolve not to take up short
of it; seek for this glory, honour, and immortality; prefer heaven and
heavenly blessings far before earth and earthly delights." We make
nothing of our religion, if we do not make heaven of it. And with the
happiness of this kingdom, seek the righteousness of it; God's
righteousness, the righteousness which he requires to be wrought in us,
and wrought by us, such as exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees; we
must follow peace and holiness, [Heb
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014.md). Secondly, The order of it. Seek
first the kingdom of God. Let your care for your souls and another world
take the place of all other cares: and let all the concerns of this life
be made subordinate to those of the life to come: we must seek the
things of Christ more than our own things; and if every they come in
competition, we must remember to which we are to give the preference.
"Seek these things first; first in thy days: let the morning of thy
youth be dedicated to God. Wisdom must be sought early; it is good
beginning betimes to be religious. Seek the first every day; let waking
thoughts be of God." Let this be our principle, to do that first which
is most needful, and let him that is the First, have the first.

\[2.\] The gracious promise annexed; all these things, the necessary
supports of life, shall be added unto you; shall be given over and
above; so it is in the margin. You shall have what you seek, the kingdom
of God and his righteousness, for never any sought in vain, that sought
in earnest; and besides that, you shall have food and raiment, by way of
overplus; as he that buys goods has paper and packthread given him in
the bargain. Godliness has the promise of the life that now is, [Ti1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008.md). Solomon asked wisdom, and had
that and other things added to him, [Ch2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#011.md), [Ch2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#012.md). O what a blessed change would it
make in our hearts and lives, did we but firmly believe this truth, that
the best way to be comfortably provided for in this world, is to be most
intent upon another world! We then begin at the right end of our work,
when we begin with God. If we give diligence to make sure to ourselves
the kingdom of God and the righteousness thereof, as to all the things
of this life, Jehovah-jireh - the Lord will provide as much of them as
he sees good for us, and more we would not wish for. Have we trusted in
him for the portion of our inheritance at our end, and shall we not
trust him for the portion of our cup, in the way to it? God's Israel
were not only brought to Canaan at last, but had their charges borne
through the wilderness. O that we were more thoughtful about the things
that are not seen, that are eternal, and then the less thoughtful we
should be, and the less thoughtful we should need to be, about the
things that are seen, that are temporal! Also regard not your stuff,
[Gen 45:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#020.md), [Gen
45:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#023.md).

7\. The morrow shall take thought for the things of itself: sufficient
unto the day is the evil thereof, [Mat
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#034.md). We must not perplex ourselves
inordinately about future events, because every day brings along with it
its own burthen of cares and grievances, as, if we look about us, and
suffer not our fears to betray the succours which grace and reason
offer, it brings along with it its own strength and supply too. So that
we are here told,

(1.) That thoughtfulness for the morrow is needless; Let the morrow take
thought for the things of itself. If wants and troubles be renewed with
the day, there are aids and provisions renewed likewise; compassions,
that are new every morning, [Lam 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#022.md),
[Lam 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#023.md). The saints have a Friend
that is their arm every morning, and gives out fresh supplies daily
([Isa 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#002).md), according as the business
of every day requires ([Ezr 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#004).md), and
so he keeps his people in constant dependence upon him. Let us refer it
therefore to the morrow's strength, to do the morrow's work, and bear
the morrow's burthen. Tomorrow, and the things of it, will be provided
for without us; why need we anxiously care for that which is so wisely
cared for already? This does not forbid a prudent foresight, and
preparation accordingly, but a perplexing solicitude, and a
prepossession of difficulties and calamities, which may perhaps never
come, or if they do, may be easily borne, and the evil of them guarded
against. The meaning is, let us mind present duty, and then leave events
to God; do the work of the day in its day, and then let tomorrow bring
its work along with it.

(2.) That thoughtfulness for the morrow is one of those foolish and
hurtful lusts, which those that will be rich fall into, and one of the
many sorrows, wherewith they pierce themselves through. Sufficient unto
the day is the evil thereof. This present day has trouble enough
attending it, we need not accumulate burthens by anticipating our
trouble, nor borrow perplexities from tomorrow's evils to add to those
of this day. It is uncertain what tomorrow's evils may be, but whatever
they be, it is time enough to take thought about them when they come.
What a folly it is to take that trouble upon ourselves this day by care
and fear, which belongs to another day, and will be never the lighter
when it comes? Let us not pull that upon ourselves all together at once,
which Providence has wisely ordered to be borne by parcels. The
conclusion of this whole matter then is, that it is the will and command
of the Lord Jesus, that his disciples should not be their own
tormentors, nor make their passage through this world more dark and
unpleasant, by their apprehension of troubles, than God has made it by
the troubles themselves. By our daily prayers we may procure strength to
bear us up under our daily troubles, and to arm us against the
temptations that attend them, and then let none of these things move us.
