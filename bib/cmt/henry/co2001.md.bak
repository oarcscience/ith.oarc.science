### [2 Corinthians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md)

After the introduction ([Co2 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md), [Co2
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#002).md) the apostle begins with the
narrative of his troubles and God's goodness, which he had met with in
Asia, by way of thanksgiving to God ([Co2
1:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#003).md), and for the edification of the
Corinthians ([Co2 1:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#007).md). Then he
attests his and his fellow-labourers' integrity ([Co2
1:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012).md), and afterwards vindicates
himself from the imputation of levity and inconstancy ([Co2
1:15-24](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#015).md).

[2 Corinthians 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 1:1</span></span>

This is the introduction to this epistle, in which we have,

I. The inscription; and therein, 1. The person from whom it was sent,
namely, Paul, who calls himself an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will
of God. The apostleship itself was ordained by Jesus Christ, according
to the will of God; and Paul was called to it by Jesus Christ, according
to the will of God. He joins Timotheus with himself in writing this
epistle; not because he needed his assistance, but that out of the mouth
of two witnesses the word might be established; and this dignifying
Timothy with the title of brother (either in the common faith, or in the
work of the ministry) shows the humility of this great apostle, and his
desire to recommend Timothy (though he was then a young man) to the
esteem of the Corinthians, and give him a reputation among the churches.
2. The persons to whom this epistle was sent, namely, the church of God
at Corinth: and not only to them, but also to all the saints in all
Achaia, that is, to all the Christians who lived in the region round
about. Note, In Christ Jesus no distinction is made between the
inhabitants of city and country; all Achaia stands upon a level in his
account.

II\. The salutation or apostolical benediction, which is the same as in
his former epistle; and therein the apostle desires the two great and
comprehensive blessings, grace and peace, for those Corinthians. These
two benefits are fitly joined together, because there is no good and
lasting peace without true grace; and both of them come from God our
Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the procurer and
dispenser of those benefits to fallen man, and is prayed to as God.

[2 Corinthians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 1:3</span></span>

After the foregoing preface, the apostle begins with the narrative of
God's goodness to him and his fellow-labourers in their manifold
tribulations, which he speaks of by way of thanksgiving to God, and to
advance the divine glory ([Co2 1:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#003).md);
and it is fit that in all things, and in the first place, God be
glorified. Observe,

I. The object of the apostle's thanksgiving, to whom he offers up
blessing and praise, namely, the blessed God, who only is to be praised,
whom he describes by several glorious and amiable titles. 1. The God and
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: ho Theos kai patēr kuriou hēmōn Iēsou
Christou. God is the Father of Christ's divine nature by eternal
generation, of his human nature by miraculous conception in the womb of
the virgin, and of Christ as God-man, and our Redeemer, by
covenant-relation, and in and through him as Mediator our God and our
Father, [Joh 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017.md). In the Old
Testament we often meet with this title, The God of Abraham, and of
Isaac, and of Jacob, to denote God's covenant-relation to them and their
seed; and in the New Testament God is styled the God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, to denote his covenant-relation to the Mediator and
his spiritual seed. [Gal 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016.md). 2. The
Father of mercies. There is a multitude of tender mercies in God
essentially, and all mercies are from God originally: mercy in his
genuine offspring and his delight. He delighteth in mercy, [Mic
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018.md). 3. The God of all comfort; from
his proceedeth the COMFORTER, [Joh
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026.md). He giveth the earnest of the
Spirit in our hearts, [Co2 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#022.md). All
our comforts come from God, and our sweetest comforts are in him.

II\. The reasons of the apostle's thanksgivings, which are these: -

1\. The benefits that he himself and his companions had received from
God; for God had comforted them in all their tribulations, [Co2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#004.md). In the world they had trouble,
but in Christ they had peace. The apostles met with many tribulations,
but they found comfort in them all: their sufferings (which are called
the sufferings of Christ, [Co2 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#005.md),
because Christ sympathized with his members when suffering for his sake)
did abound, but their consolation by Christ did abound also. Note, (1.)
Then are we qualified to receive the comfort of God's mercies when we
set ourselves to give him the glory of them. (2.) Then we speak best of
God and his goodness when we speak from our own experience, and, in
telling others, tell God also what he has done for our souls.

2\. The advantage which others might receive; for God intended that they
should be able to comfort others in trouble ([Co2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#004).md), by communicating to them their
experiences of the divine goodness and mercy; and the sufferings of good
men have a tendency to this good end ([Co2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#006).md) when they are endued with faith
and patience. Note, (1.) What favours God bestows on us are intended not
only to make us cheerful ourselves, but also that we may be useful to
others. (2.) If we do imitate the faith and patience of good men in
their afflictions, we may hope to partake of their consolations here and
their salvation hereafter.

[2 Corinthians 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 1:7</span></span>

In these verses the apostle speaks for the encouragement and edification
of the Corinthians; and tells them ([Co2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#007).md) of his persuasion or stedfast
hope that they should receive benefit by the troubles he and his
companions in labour and travel had met with, that their faith should
not be weakened, but their consolations increased. In order to this he
tells them, 1. What their sufferings had been ([Co2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#008).md): We would not have you ignorant
of our trouble. It was convenient for the churches to know what were the
sufferings of their ministers. It is not certain what particular
troubles in Asia are here referred to; whether the tumult raised by
Demetrius at Ephesus, mentioned Acts 19, or the fight with beasts at
Ephesus, mentioned in the former epistle ([Co1
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032).md), or some other trouble; for the
apostle was in deaths often. This however is evident, that they were
great tribulations. They were pushed out of measure, to a very
extraordinary degree, above the common strength of men, or of ordinary
Christians, to bear up under them, insomuch that they despaired even of
life ([Co2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#008).md), and thought they
should have been killed, or have fainted away and expired. 2. What they
did in their distress: They trusted in God. And they were brought to
this extremity in order that they should not trust in themselves but in
God, [Co2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#009.md). Note, God often brings
his people into great straits, that they may apprehend their own
insufficiency to help themselves, and may be induced to place their
trust and hope in his all-sufficiency. Our extremity is God's
opportunity. In the mount will the Lord be seen; and we may safely trust
in God, who raiseth the dead, [Co2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#009.md). God's raising the dead is a proof
of his almighty power. He that can do this can do any thing, can do all
things, and is worthy to be trusted in at all times. Abraham's faith
fastened upon this instance of the divine power: He believed God who
quickeneth the dead, [Rom 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#017.md). If we
should be brought so low as to despair even of life, yet we may then
trust in God, who can bring back not only from the gates, but from the
jaws, of death. 3. What the deliverance was that they had obtained; and
this was seasonable and continued. Their hope and trust were not in
vain, nor shall any who trust in him be ashamed. God had delivered them,
and did still deliver them, [Co2 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#010.md).
Having obtained help of God, they continued to that day, [Act
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#022.md). 4. What use they made of this
deliverance: We trust that he will yet deliver us ([Co2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#010).md), that God will deliver to the
end, and preserve to his heavenly kingdom. Note, Past experiences are
great encouragements to faith and hope, and they lay great obligations
to trust in God for time to come. We reproach our experiences if we
distrust God in future straits, who hath delivered as in former
troubles. David, even when a young man, and when he had but a small
stock of experiences, argued after the manner of the apostle here, [Sa1
17:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#037.md). 5. What was desired of the
Corinthians upon this account: That they would help together by prayer
for them ([Co2 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#011).md), by social
prayer, agreeing and joining together in prayer on their behalf. Note,
our trusting in God must not supersede the use of any proper and
appointed means; and prayer is one of those means. We should pray for
ourselves and for one another. The apostle had himself a great interest
in the throne of grace, yet he desires the help of others' prayers. If
we thus help one another by our prayers, we may hope for an occasion of
giving thanks by many for answer of prayer. And it is our duty not only
to help one another with prayer, but in praise and thanksgiving, and
thereby to make suitable returns for benefits received.

[2 Corinthians 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 1:12</span></span>

The apostle in these verses attests their integrity by the sincerity of
their conversation. This he does not in a way of boasting and
vain-glory, but as one good reason for desiring the help of prayer, as
well as for the more comfortably trusting in God ([Heb
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#018).md), and for the necessary
vindication of himself from the aspersions of some persons at Corinth,
who reproached his person and questioned his apostleship. Here,

I. He appeals to the testimony of conscience with rejoicing ([Co2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012).md), in which observe, 1. The
witness appealed to, namely, conscience, which is instead of a thousand
witnesses. This God's deputy in the soul, and the voice of conscience is
the voice of God. They rejoiced in the testimony of conscience, when
their enemies reproached them, and were enraged against them. Note, The
testimony of conscience for us, if that be right and upon good grounds,
will be matter of rejoicing at all times and in all conditions. 2. The
testimony this witness gave. And here take notice, Conscience witnessed,
(1.) Concerning their conversation, their constant course and tenour of
life: by that we may judge of ourselves, and not by this or that single
act. (2.) Concerning the nature or manner of their conversation; that it
was in simplicity and godly sincerity. This blessed apostle was a true
Israelite, a man of plain dealing; you might know where to have him. He
was not a man who seemed to be one thing and was another, but a man of
sincerity. (3.) Concerning the principle they acted from in all their
conversation, both in the world and towards these Corinthians; and that
was not fleshly wisdom, nor carnal politics and worldly views, but it
was the grace of God, a vital gracious principle in their hearts, that
cometh from God, and tendeth to God. Then will our conversation be well
ordered when we live and act under the influence and command of such a
gracious principle in the heart.

II\. He appeals to the knowledge of the Corinthians with hope and
confidence, [Co2 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#013.md), [Co2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#014.md). Their conversation did in part
fall under the observation of the Corinthians; and these knew how they
behaved themselves, how holily, and justly, and unblamably; they never
found any thing in them unbecoming an honest man. This they had
acknowledged in part already, and he doubted not but they would still do
so to the end, that is, that they would never have any good reason to
think or say otherwise of him, but that he was an honest man. And so
there would be mutual rejoicing in one another. We are your rejoicing,
even as you also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus. Note, It is
happy when ministers and people do rejoice in each other here; and this
joy will be complete in that day when the great Shepherd of the sheep
shall appear.

[2 Corinthians 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 1:15</span></span>

The apostle here vindicates himself from the imputation of levity and
inconstancy, in that he did not hold his purpose of coming to them at
Corinth. His adversaries there sought all occasions to blemish his
character, and reflect upon his conduct; and, it seemed, they took hold
of this handle to reproach his person and discredit his ministry. Now,
for his justification,

I. He avers the sincerity of his intention ([Co2
1:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#015).md), and he does this in
confidence of their good opinion of him, and that they would believe
him, when he assured them he was minded, or did really intend, to come
to them, and that with the design, not that he might receive, but that
they might receive a second benefit, that is, a further advantage by his
ministry. He tells them that he had not herein used lightness ([Co2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#017).md), that, as he aimed not at any
secular advantage to himself (for his purpose was not according to the
flesh, that is, with carnal views and aims), so it was not a rash and
inconsiderate resolution that he had taken up, for he had laid his
measures thus of passing by them to Macedonia, and coming again to them
from Macedonia in his way to Judea ([Co2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#016).md), and therefore they might
conclude that it was for some weighty reasons that he had altered his
purpose; and that with him there was not yea yea, and nay nay, [Co2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#017.md). He was not to be accused of
levity and inconstancy, nor a contradiction between his words and
intentions. Note, Good men should be careful to preserve the reputation
of sincerity and constancy; they should not resolve but upon mature
deliberation, and they will not change their resolves but for weighty
reasons.

II\. He would not have the Corinthians to infer that his gospel was
false or uncertain, nor that it was contradictory in itself, nor unto
truth, [Co2 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#018.md), [Co2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#019.md). For if it had been so, that he
had been fickle in his purposes, or even false in the promises he made
of coming to them (which he was not justly to be accused of, and so some
understand his expression, [Co2 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#018.md),
Our word towards you was not yea and nay), yet it would not follow that
the gospel preached not only by him, but also by others in full
agreement with him, was either false or doubtful. For God is true, and
the Son of God, Jesus Christ, is true. The true God, and eternal life.
Jesus Christ, whom the apostle preached, is not yea and nay, but in him
was yea ([Co2 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#019).md), nothing but
infallible truth. And the promises of God in Christ are not yea and nay,
but yea and amen, [Co2 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020.md). There is
an inviolable constancy and unquestionable sincerity and certainty in
all the parts of the gospel of Christ. If in the promises that the
ministers of the gospel make as common men, and about their own affairs,
they see cause sometimes to vary from them, yet the promises of the
gospel covenant, which they preach, stand firm and inviolable. Bad men
are false; good men are fickle; but God is true, neither fickle nor
false. The apostle, having mentioned the stability of the divine
promises, makes a digression to illustrate this great and sweet truth,
that all the promises of God are yea and amen. For, 1. They are the
promises of the God of truth ([Co2
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020).md), of him that cannot lie, whose
truth as well as mercy endureth for ever. 2. They are made in Christ
Jesus ([Co2 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020).md), the Amen, the true
and faithful witness; he hath purchased and ratified the covenant of
promises, and is the surety of the covenant, [Heb
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#022.md). 3. They are confirmed by the
Holy Spirit. He does establish Christians in the faith of the gospel; he
has anointed them with his sanctifying grace, which in scripture is
often compared to oil; he has sealed them, for their security and
confirmation; and he is given as an earnest in their hearts, [Co2
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#021.md), [Co2
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#022.md). An earnest secures the promise,
and is part of the payment. The illumination of the Spirit is an earnest
of everlasting life; and the comforts of the Spirit are an earnest of
everlasting joy. Note, The veracity of God, the mediation of Christ, and
the operation of the Spirit, are all engaged that the promises shall be
sure to all the seed, and the accomplishment of them shall be to the
glory of God ([Co2 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020).md) for the glory
of his rich and sovereign grace, and never-failing truth and
faithfulness.

III\. The apostle gives a good reason why he did not come to Corinth, as
was expected, [Co2 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#023.md). It was that
he might spare them. They ought therefore to own his kindness and
tenderness. He knew there were things amiss among them, and such as
deserved censure, but was desirous to show tenderness. He assures them
that this is the true reason, after this very solemn manner: I call God
for a record upon my soul - a way of speaking not justifiable where used
in trivial matters; but this was very justifiable in the apostle, for
his necessary vindication, and for the credit and usefulness of his
ministry, which was struck at by his opposers. He adds, to prevent
mistakes, that he did not pretend to have any dominion over their faith,
[Co2 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#024.md). Christ only is the Lord of
our faith; he is the author and finisher of our faith, [Heb
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002.md). He reveals to us what we must
believe. Paul, and Apollos, and the rest of the apostles, were but
ministers by whom they believed ([Co1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#005).md), and so the helpers of their joy,
even the joy of faith. For by faith we stand firmly, and live safely and
comfortably. Our strength and ability are owing to faith, and our
comfort and joy must flow from faith.
