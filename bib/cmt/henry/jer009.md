### [Jeremiah Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 9:0</span></span>

In this chapter the prophet goes on faithfully to reprove sin and to
threaten God's judgments for it, and yet bitterly to lament both, as one
that neither rejoiced at iniquity nor was glad at calamities. I. He here
expresses his great grief for the miseries of Judah and Jerusalem, and
his detestation of their sins, which brought those miseries upon them
([Jer 9:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001).md). II. He justifies God in
the greatness of the destruction brought upon them ([Jer
9:9-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#009).md). III. He calls upon others to
bewail the woeful case of Judah and Jerusalem ([Jer
9:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#017).md). IV. He shows them the folly
and vanity of trusting in their own strength or wisdom, or the
privileges of their circumcision, or any thing but God only ([Jer
9:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#023).md).

[Jeremiah 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 9:1</span></span>

The prophet, being commissioned both to foretel the destruction coming
upon Judah and Jerusalem and to point out the sin for which that
destruction was brought upon them, here, as elsewhere, speaks of both
very feelingly: what he said of both came from the heart, and therefore
one would have thought it would reach to the heart.

I. He abandons himself to sorrow in consideration of the calamitous
condition of his people, which he sadly laments, a one that preferred
Jerusalem before his chief joy and her grievances before his chief
sorrows.

1\. He laments the slaughter of the persons, the blood shed and the
lives lost ([Jer 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001).md): "O that my head
were waters, quite melted and dissolved with grief, that so my eyes
might be fountains of tears, weeping abundantly, continually, and
without intermission, still sending forth fresh floods of tears as there
still occur fresh occasions for them!" The same word in Hebrew signifies
both the eye and a fountain, as if in this land of sorrows our eyes were
designed rather for weeping than seeing. Jeremiah wept much, and yet
wished he could weep more, that he might affect a stupid people and
rouse them to a due sense of the hand of God gone out against them.
Note, It becomes us, while we are here in this vale of tears, to conform
to the temper of the climate and to sow in tears. Blessed are those that
mourn, for they shall be comforted hereafter; but let them expect that
while they are here the clouds will still return after the rain. While
we find our hearts such fountains of sin, it is fit that our eyes should
be fountains of tears. But Jeremiah's grief here is upon the public
account: he would weep day and night, not so much for the death of his
own near relations, but for the slain of the daughter of his people, the
multitudes of his countrymen that fell by the sword of war. Note, When
we hear of the numbers of the slain in great battles and sieges we ought
to be much affected with the intelligence, and not to make a light
matter of it; yea, though they be not of the daughter of our people,
for, whatever people they are of, they are of the same human nature with
us, and there are so many precious lives lost, as dear to them as ours
to us, and so many precious souls gone into eternity.

2\. He laments the desolations of the country. This he brings in (v.
10), for impassioned mourners are not often very methodical in their
discourses: "Not only for the towns and cities, but for the mountains,
will I take up a weeping and wailing" (not barren mountains, but the
fruitful hills with which Judea abounded), and for the habitations of
the wilderness, or rather the pastures of the plain, that used to be
clothed with flocks or covered over with corn, and a goodly sight it
was; but now they are burnt up by the Chaldean army (which, according to
the custom of war, destroyed to the custom of war, destroyed the forage
and carried off all the cattle), so that no one dares to pass through
them, for fear of meeting with some parties of the enemy, no one cares
to pass through them, every thing looks so melancholy and frightful, no
one has any business to pass through them, for they hear not the voice
of the cattle there as usual, the bleating of the sheep and the lowing
of the oxen, that grateful music to the owners; nay, both the fowl of
the heavens and the beasts have fled. either frightened away by the rude
noises and terrible fires which the enemies make, or forced away because
there is no subsistence for them. Note, God has many ways of turning a
fruitful land into barrenness for the wickedness of those that dwell
therein; and the havoc war makes in a country cannot but be for a
lamentation to all tender spirits, for it is a tragedy which destroys
the stage it is acted on.

II\. He abandons himself to solitude, in consideration of the scandalous
character and conduct of his people. Though he dwells in Judah where God
is known, in Salem where his tabernacle is, yet he is ready to cry out,
Woe is me that I sojourn in Mesech! [Psa
120:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#005.md). While all his neighbours are
fleeing to the defenced cities, and Jerusalem especially, in dread of
the enemies' rage ([Jer 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#005.md), [Jer
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#006).md) he is contriving to retire into
some desert, in detestation of his people's sin ([Jer
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#002).md): "O that I had in the wilderness
a lodging-place of wayfaring men, such a lonely cottage to dwell in as
they have in the deserts of Arabia, which are uninhabited, for
travellers to repose themselves in, that I might leave my people and go
from them!" Not only because of the ill usage they gave him (he would
rather venture himself among the wild beasts of the desert than among
such treacherous barbarous people), but principally because his
righteous soul was vexed from day to day, as Lot's was in Sodom, with
the wickedness of their conversation, [Pe2
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#007.md), [Pe2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#008.md). This does not imply any intention
or resolution that he had thus to retire. God had cut him out work among
them, which he must not quit for his own ease. We must not go out of the
world, bad as it is, before our time. If he could not reform them, he
could bear a testimony against them; if he could not do good to many,
yet he might to some. but it intimates the temptation he was in to leave
them, involves a threatening that they should be deprived of his
ministry, and especially expresses the holy indignation he had against
their abominable wickedness, which continued notwithstanding all the
pains he had taken with them to reclaim them. It made him even weary of
his life to see them dishonouring God as they did and destroying
themselves. Time was when the place which God had chosen to put his name
there was the desire and delight of good men. David, in a wilderness,
longed to be again in the courts of God's house; but now Jeremiah, in
the courts of God's house (for there he was when he said this), wishes
himself in a wilderness. Those have made themselves very miserable that
have made God's people and ministers weary of them and willing to get
from them. Now, to justify his willingness to leave them, he shows,

1\. What he himself had observed among them.

(1.) He would not think of leaving them because they were poor and in
distress, but because they were wicked. \[1.\] They were filthy: They
are all adulterers, that is, the generality of them are, [Jer
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#008.md). They all either practised this
sin or connived at those that did. Lewdness and uncleanness constituted
that crying sin of Sodom at which righteous Lot was vexed in soul, and
it is a sin that renders men loathsome in the eyes of God and all good
men; it makes men an abomination. \[2.\] They were false. This is the
sin that is most enlarged upon here. Those that had been unfaithful to
their God were so to one another, and it was a part of their punishment
as well as their sin, for even those that love to cheat, yet hate to be
cheated. First, Go into their solemn meetings for the exercises of
religion, for the administration of justice, or for commerce - to
church, to court, or to the exchange - and they are an assembly of
treacherous men; they are so by consent, they strengthen one another's
hands in doing any thing that is perfidious. There they will cheat
deliberately and industriously, with design, with a malicious design,
for ([Jer 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#003).md) they bend their
tongues, like their bow, for lies, with a great deal of craft; their
tongues are fitted for lying, as a bow that is bent is for shooting, and
are as constantly used for that purpose. Their tongue turns as naturally
to a lie as the bow to the strong. But they are not valiant for the
truth upon the earth. Their tongues are like a bow strung, with which
they might do good service if they would use the art and resolution
which they are so much masters of in the cause of truth; but they will
not do so. They appear not in defence of the truths of God, which were
delivered to them by the prophets; but even those that could not deny
them to be truths were content to see them run down. In the
administration of justice they have not courage to stand by an honest
cause that has truth on its side, if greatness and power be on the other
side. Those that will be faithful to the truth must be valiant for it,
and not be daunted by the opposition given to it, nor fear the face of
man. They are not valiant for the truth in the land, the land which has
truth for the glory of it. Truth has fallen in the land, and they dare
not lend a hand to help it up, [Isa
59:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#014.md), [Isa
59:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#015.md). We must answer, another day,
not only for our enmity in opposing truth, but for our cowardice in
defending it. Secondly, Go into their families, and you will find they
will cheat their own brethren (every brother will utterly supplant);
they will trip up one another's heels if they can, for they lie at the
catch to seek all advantages against those they hope to make a hand of.
Jacob had his name from supplanting; it is the word here used; they
followed him in his name, but not in his true character, without guile.
So very false are they that you cannot trust in a brother, but must
stand as much upon your guard as if you were dealing with a stranger,
with a Canaanite that has balances of deceit in his hand. Things have
come to an ill pass indeed when a man cannot put confidence in his own
brother. Thirdly, Go into company and observe both their commerce and
their conversation, and you will find there is nothing of sincerity or
common honesty among them. Nec hospes ab hospite tutus - The host and
the guest are in danger from each other. The best advice a wise man can
give you is to take heed every one of his neighbour, nay, of his friend
(so some read it), of him whom he has befriended and who pretends
friendship to him. No man thinks himself bound to be either grateful or
sincere. Take them in their conversation and every neighbour will walk
with slander; they care not what ill they say one of another, though
ever so false; that way that the slander goes they will go; they will
walk with it. They will walk about from house to house too, carrying
slanders along with them, all the ill-natured stories they can pick up
or invent to make mischief. Take them in their trading and bargaining,
and they will deceive every one his neighbour, will say any thing,
though they know it to be false, for their own advantage. Nay, they will
lie for lying sake, to keep their tongues in use to it, for they will
not speak the truth, but will tell a deliberate lie and laugh at it when
they have done.

(2.) That which aggravates the sin on this false and lying generation
is, \[1.\] That they are ingenious to sin: They have taught their tongue
to speak lies, implying that through the reluctances of natural
conscience they found it difficult to bring themselves to it. Their
tongue would have spoken truth, but they taught it to speak lies, and by
degrees have made themselves masters of the art of lying, and have got
such a habit of it that use has made it a second nature to them. They
learnt it when they were young (for the wicked are estranged from the
womb, speaking lies, [Psa 58:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#003).md), and
now they have grown dexterous at it. \[2.\] That they are industrious to
sin: They weary themselves to commit iniquity; they put a force upon
their consciences to bring themselves to it; they tire out their
convictions by offering them continual violence, and they take a great
deal of pains, till they have even spent themselves in bringing about
their malicious designs. They are wearied with their sinful pursuits and
yet not weary of them. The service of sin is a perfect drudgery; men run
themselves out of breath in it, and put themselves to a great deal of
toil to damn their own souls. \[3.\] That they grow worse and worse
([Jer 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#003).md): They proceed from evil to
evil, from one sin to another, from one degree of sin to another. They
began with less sins. Nemo repente fit turpissimus - No one reaches the
height of vice at once. They began with equivocating and bantering, but
at last came to downright lying. And they are now proceeding to greater
sins yet, for they know not me, saith the Lord; and where men have no
knowledge of God, or no consideration of what they have known of him,
what good can be expected from them? Men's ignorance of God is the cause
of all their ill conduct one towards another.

2\. The prophet shows what God had informed him of their wickedness, and
what he had determined against them.

(1.) God had marked their sin. He could tell the prophet (and he speaks
of it with compassion) what sort of people they were that he had to deal
with. I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, [Rev
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#013.md). So here ([Jer
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#006).md): "Thy habitation is in the midst
of deceit, all about thee are addicted to it; therefore stand upon thy
guard." If all men are liars, it concerns us to beware of men,. and to
be wise as serpents. They are deceitful men; therefore there is little
hope of thy doing any good among them; for, make things ever so plain,
they have some trick or other wherewith to shuffle off their
convictions. This charge is enlarged upon, [Jer
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#008.md). Their tongue was a bow bent ([Jer
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#003).md), plotting and preparing mischief;
here it is an arrow shot out, putting in execution what they had
projected. It is as a slaying arrow (so some readings of the original
have it); their tongue has been to many an instrument of death. They
speak peaceably to their neighbours, against whom they are at the same
time lying in wait; as Joab kissed Abner when he was about to kill him,
and Cain, that he might not be suspected of any ill design, talked with
his brother, freely and familiarly. Note, Fair words, when they are not
attended with good intentions, are despicable, but, when they are
intended as a cloak and cover for wicked intentions they are abominable.
While they did all this injury to one another they put a great contempt
upon God: "Not only they know not me, but ([Jer
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#006).md) through deceit, through the
delusions of the false prophets, they refuse to know me; they are so
cheated into a good opinion of their own ways, the ways of their own
heart, that they desire not the knowledge of my ways." Or, "They are so
wedded to this sinful course which they are in, and so bewitched with
that, and its gains, that they will by no means admit the knowledge of
God, because that would be a check upon them in their sins." This is the
ruin of sinners: they might be taught the good knowledge of the Lord and
they will not learn it; and where no knowledge of God is, what good can
be expected? [Hos 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md).

(2.) He had marked them for ruin, [Jer
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#007.md), [Jer
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#009.md), [Jer
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#011.md). Those that will not know God as
their lawgiver shall be made to know him as their judge. God determines
here to bring his judgments upon them, for the refining of some and the
ruining of the rest. \[1.\] Some shall be refined ([Jer
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#007).md): "Because they are thus corrupt,
behold I will melt them and try them, will bring them into trouble and
see what that will do towards bringing them to repentance, whether the
furnace of affliction will purify them from their dross, and whether,
when they are melted, they will be new-cast in a better mould." He will
make trial of less afflictions before he brings upon them utter
destruction; for he desires not the death of sinners. They shall not be
rejected as reprobate silver till the founder has melted in vain, [Jer
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#029.md), [Jer
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#030.md). For how shall I do for the
daughter of my people? He speaks as one consulting with himself what to
do with them that might be for the best, and as one that could not find
in his heart to cast them off and give them up to ruin till he had first
tried all means likely to bring them to repentance. Or, "How else shall
I do for them? They have grown so very corrupt that there is no other
way with them but to put them into the furnace; what other course can I
take with them? [Isa 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#004.md), [Isa
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#005.md). It is the daughter of my people,
and I must do something to vindicate my own honour, which will be
reflected upon if I connive at their wickedness. I must do something to
reduce and reform them." A parent corrects his own children because they
are his own. Note, When God afflicts his people, it is with a gracious
design to mollify and reform them; it is but when need is and when he
knows it is the best method he can use. \[2.\] The rest shall be ruined
([Jer 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#009).md): Shall I not visit for
these things? Fraud and falsehood are sins which God hates and which he
will reckon for. "Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this,
that is so universally corrupt, and, by its impudence in sin, even dares
and defies divine vengeance? The sentence is passed, the decree has gone
forth ([Jer 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#011).md): I will make
Jerusalem heaps of rubbish, and lay it in such ruins that it shall be
fit for nothing but to be a den of dragons; and the cities of Judah
shall be a desolation." God makes them so, for he gives the enemy
warrant and power to do it: but why is the holy city made a heap? The
answer is ready, Because it has become an unholy one?

[Jeremiah 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 9:12</span></span>

Two things the prophet designs, in these verses, with reference to the
approaching destruction of Judah and Jerusalem: - 1. To convince people
of the justice of God in it, that they had by sin brought it upon
themselves and that therefore they had no reason to quarrel with God,
who did them no wrong at all, but a great deal of reason to fall out
with their sins, which did them all this mischief. 2. To affect people
with the greatness of the desolation that was coming, and the miserable
effects of it, that by a terrible prospect of it they might be awakened
to repentance and reformation, which was the only way to prevent it, or,
at least, mitigate their own share in it. This being designed,

I. He calls for the thinking men, by them to show people the equity of
God's proceedings, though they seemed harsh and severe ([Jer
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#012).md): "Who, where, is the wise man,
or the prophet, to whom the mouth of the Lord hath spoken? You boast of
your wisdom, and of the prophets you have among you; produce me any one
that has but the free use of human reason or any acquaintance with
divine revelation, and he will soon understand this himself, and it will
be so clear to him that he will be ready to declare it to others, that
there is a just ground of God's controversy with this people." Do these
wise men enquire, For what does the land perish? What is the matter,
that such a change is made with this land? It used to be a land that God
cared for, and he had his eyes upon it for good ([Deu
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#012).md), but it is now a land that he
has forsaken and that his face is against. It used to flourish as the
garden of the Lord and to be replenished with inhabitants; but now it is
burnt up like a wilderness, that none passeth through it, much less
cares to settle in it. It was supposed, long ago, that it would be
asked, when it came to this, Wherefore has the Lord done thus unto this
land? What means the heat of this great anger? ([Deu
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#024).md), to which question God here
gives a full answer, before which all flesh must be silent. He produces
out of the record,

1\. The indictment preferred and proved against them, upon which they
had been found guilty, [Jer 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#013.md), [Jer
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#014.md). It is charged upon them, and it
cannot be denied, (1.) That they have revolted from their allegiance to
their rightful Sovereign. Therefore. God has forsaken their land, and
justly, because they have forsaken his law, which he had so plainly, so
fully, so frequently set before them, and had not observed his orders,
not obeyed his voice, nor walked in the ways that he had appointed. Here
their wickedness began, in the omission of their duty to their God and a
contempt of his authority. But it did not end here. It is further
charged upon them, (2.) That they have entered themselves into the
service of pretenders and usurpers, have not only withdrawn themselves
from their obedience to their prince, but have taken up arms against
him. For, \[1.\] They have acted according to the dictates of their own
lusts, have set up their own will, the wills of the flesh, and the
carnal mind, in competition with, and contradiction to the will of God:
They have walked after the imagination of their own hearts; they would
do as they pleased, whatever God and conscience said to the contrary.
\[2.\] They have worshipped the creatures of their own fancy, the work
of their own hands, according to the tradition received from their
fathers: They have walked after Baalim: the word is plural; they had
many Baals, Baal-peor and Baal-berith, the Baal of this place and the
Baal of the other place; for they had lords many, which their fathers
taught them to worship, but which the God of their fathers had again and
again forbidden. This was it for which the land perished. The King of
kings never makes war thus upon his own subjects but when they
treacherously depart from him and rebel against him, and it has become
necessary by this means to chastise their rebellion and reduce them to
their allegiance; and they themselves shall at length acknowledge that
he is just in all that is brought upon them.

2\. The judgment given upon this indictment, the sentence upon the
convicted rebels, which must now be executed, for it was righteous and
nothing could be moved in arrest of it: The Lord of hosts, the God of
Israel, hath said it ([Jer 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#015.md), [Jer
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#016)), and who can reverse it? (1..md)
That all their comforts at home shall be poisoned and embittered to
them: I will feed this people with wormwood (or rather with wolf's-bane,
for it signifies a herb that is not wholesome, as wormwood is though it
be bitter, but some herb that is both nauseous and noxious), and I will
give them water of gall (or juice of hemlock or some other herb that is
poisonous) to drink. Every thing about them, till it comes to their very
meat and drink, shall be a terror and torment to them. God will curse
their blessings, [Mal 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#002). (2..md) That
their dispersion abroad shall be their destruction ([Jer
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#016).md): I will scatter them among the
heathen. They were corrupted and debauched by their intimacy with the
heathen, with whom they mingled and learned their works; and now they
shall lose themselves, where they lost their virtue, among the heathen.
They set up gods which neither they nor their fathers had known, strange
gods, new gods ([Deu 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#017).md); and now
God will put them among neighbours whom neither they nor their fathers
have known, whom they can claim no acquaintance with, and therefore can
expect no favour from. And yet, though they are scattered so as that
they will not know where to find one another. God will know where to
find them all out ([Psa 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#008).md) with
that evil which still pursues impenitent sinners: I will send a sword
after them, some killing judgment or other, till I have consumed them;
for when God judges he will overcome, when he pursues he will overtake.
And now we see for what the land perishes; all this desolation is the
desert of their deeds and the performance of God's words.

II\. He calls for the mourning women, and engages them, with the arts
they practise to affect people and move their passions, to lament these
sad calamities that had come or were coming upon them, that the nation
might be alarmed to prepare for them: The Lord of hosts himself says,
Call for the mourning women, that they may come, [Jer
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#017.md). the scope of this is to show how
very woeful and lamentable the condition of this people was likely to
be. 1. Here is work for the counterfeit mourners: Send for cunning
women, that know how to compose mournful ditties, or at least to sing
them in mournful tunes and accents, and therefore are made use of at
funerals to supply the want of true mourners. Let these take up a
wailing for us, [Jer 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#018.md). The deaths
and funerals were so many that people wept for them till they had no
power to weep, as those, [Sa1 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#004.md).
Let those therefore do it now whose trade it is. Or, rather, it
intimates the extreme sottishness and stupidity of the people, that laid
not to heart the judgments they were under, nor, even when there was so
much blood shed, could find in their hearts to shed a tear. They cry not
when God binds them, [Job 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#013.md). God
sent his mourning prophets to them, to call them to weeping and
mourning, but his word in their mouths did not work upon their faith;
rather therefore than they shall go laughing to their ruin, let the
mourning women come, and try to work upon their fancy, that their eyes
may at length run down with tears, and their eyelids gush out with
waters. First or last, sinners must be weepers. 2. Here is work for the
real mourners. (1.) There is that which is a lamentation. The present
scene is very tragical ([Jer 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#019).md): A
voice of wailing is heard out of Zion. Some make this to be the song of
the mourning women: it is rather an echo to it, returned by those whose
affections were moved by their wailings. In Zion the voice of joy and
praise used to be heard, while the people kept closely to God. But sin
has altered the note; it is now the voice of lamentation. It should seem
to be the voice of those who fled from all parts of the country to the
castle of Zion for protection. Instead of rejoicing that they had got
safely thither, they lamented that they were forced to seek for shelter
there: "How are we spoiled! How are we stripped of all our possessions!
We are greatly confounded, ashamed of ourselves and our poverty;" for
that is it that they complain of, that is it that they blush at the
thoughts of, rather than of their sin: We are confounded because we have
forsaken the land (forced so to do by the enemy), not because we have
forsaken the Lord, being drawn aside of our own lust and enticed -
because our dwellings have cast us out, not because our God has cast us
off. Thus unhumbled hearts lament their calamity, but not their
iniquity, the procuring cause of it. (2.) There is more still to come
which shall be for a lamentation. Things are bad, but they are likely to
be worse. Those whose land has spued them out (as it did their
predecessors the Canaanites, and justly, because they trod in their
steps, [Lev 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#028).md) complain that they
are driven into the city, but, after a while, those of the city, and
they with them, shall be forced thence too: Yet hear the word of the
Lord; he has something more to say to you ([Jer
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#020).md); let the women hear it, whose
tender spirits are apt to receive the impressions of grief and fear, for
the men will not heed it, will not give it a patient hearing. The
prophets will be glad to preach to a congregation of women that tremble
at God's word. Let your ear receive the word of God's mouth, and bid it
welcome, though it be a word of terror. Let the women teach their
daughters wailing; this intimates that the trouble shall last long,
grief shall be entailed upon the generation to come. Young people are
apt to love mirth, and expect mirth, and are disposed to be gay and
airy; but let the elder women teach the younger to be serious, tell them
what a vale of tears they must expect to find this world, and train them
up among the mourners in Zion, [Tit
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#004.md), [Tit
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#005.md). Let every one teach her neighbour
lamentation; this intimates that the trouble shall spread far, shall go
from house to house. People shall not need to sympathize with their
friends; they shall all have cause enough to mourn for themselves. Note,
Those that are themselves affected with the terrors of the Lord should
endeavour to affect others with them. The judgment here threatened is
made to look terrible. \[1.\] Multitudes shall be slain, [Jer
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#021.md). Death shall ride in triumph, and
there shall be no escaping his arrests when he comes with commission,
neither within doors nor without. Not within doors, for let the doors be
shut ever so fast, let them be ever so firmly locked and bolted, death
comes up into our windows, like a thief in the night; it steals upon us
ere we are aware. Nor does it thus boldly attack the cottages only, but
it has entered into our palaces, the palaces of our princes and great
men, though ever so stately, ever so strongly built and guarded. Note,
No palaces can keep out death. Nor are those more safe that are abroad;
death cuts off even the children from without and the young men from the
streets. The children who might have been spared by the enemy in pity,
because they had never been hurtful to them, and the young men who might
have been spared in policy, because capable of being serviceable to
them, shall fall together by the sword. It is usual now, even in the
severest military executions, to put none to the sword. It is usual now,
even in the severest military executions, to put none to the sword but
those that are found in arms; but then even the boys and girls playing
in the streets were sacrificed to the fury of the conqueror. \[2.\]
Those that are slain shall be left unburied ([Jer
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#022).md): Speak, Thus saith the Lord (for
the confirmation and aggravation of what was before said), Even the
carcases of men shall fall as dung, neglected, and left to be offensive
to the smell, as dung is. Common humanity obliges the survivors to bury
the dead, even for their own sake; but here such numbers shall be slain,
and those so dispersed all the country over, that it shall be an endless
thing to bury them all, nor shall there be hands enough to do it, nor
shall the conquerors permit it, and those that should do it shall be
overwhelmed with grief, so that they shall have no heart to do it. The
dead bodies even of the fairest and strongest, when they have lain
awhile, become dung, such vile bodies have we. And here such multitudes
shall fall that their bodies shall lie as thick as heaps of dung in the
furrows of the field, and no more notice shall be taken of them than of
the handfuls which the harvestman drops for the gleaners, for none shall
gather them, but they shall remain in sight, monuments of divine
vengeance, that the eye of the impenitent survivors may affect their
heart. Slay them not, bury them not, lest my people forget, [Psa
59:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#011.md).

[Jeremiah 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 9:23</span></span>

The prophet had been endeavouring to possess this people with a holy
fear of God and his judgments, to convince them both of sin and wrath;
but still they had recourse to some sorry subterfuge or other, under
which to shelter themselves from the conviction and with which to excuse
themselves in the obstinacy and carelessness. He therefore sets himself
here to drive them from these refuges of lies and to show them the
insufficiency of them.

I. When they were told how inevitable the judgment would be they pleaded
the defence of their politics and powers, which, with the help of their
wealth and treasure, they thought made their city impregnable. In answer
to this he shows them the folly of trusting to and boasting of all these
stays, while they have not a God in covenant to stay themselves upon,
[Jer 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#023.md), [Jer
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#024.md). Here he shows, 1. What we may
not depend upon in a day of distress: Let not the wise man glory in his
wisdom, as if with the help of that he could outwit or countermine the
enemy, or in the greatest extremity find out some evasion or other; for
a man's wisdom may fail him when he needs it most, and he may fail him
when he needs it most, and he may be taken in his own craftiness.
Ahithophel was befooled, and counsellors are often led away spoiled.
But, if a man's policies fail him, yet surely he may gain his point by
might and dint of courage. No: Let not the strong man glory in his
strength, for the battle is not always to the strong. David the
stripling proves too hard for Goliath the giant. All human force is
nothing without God, worse than nothing against him. But may not the
rich man's wealth be his strong city? (money answers all things) No: Let
not the rich man glory in his riches, for they may prove so far from
sheltering him that they may expose him and make him the fairer mark.
Let not the people boast of the wise men, and mighty men, and rich men
that they have among them, as if they could make their part good against
the Chaldeans because they have wise men to advise concerning the war,
mighty men to fight their battles, and rich men to bear the charges of
the war. Let not particular persons think to escape the common calamity
by their wisdom, might, or money; for all these will prove but vain
things for safety. 2. He shows what we may depend upon in a day of
distress. (1.) Our only comfort in trouble will be that we have done our
duty. Those that refused to know God ([Jer
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#006).md) will boast in vain of their
wisdom and wealth; but those that know God, intelligently, that
understand aright that he is the Lord, that have not only right
apprehensions concerning his nature, and attributes, and relations to
man, but receive and retain the impressions of them, may glory in this
it will be their rejoicing in the day of evil. (2.) Our only confidence
in trouble will be that, having through grace in some measure done our
duty, we shall find God a God all-sufficient to us. We may glory in
this, that, wherever we are, we have an acquaintance with an interest in
a God that exercises lovingkindness, and judgment, and righteousness in
the earth, that is not only just to all his creatures and will do no
wrong to any of them, but kind to all his children and will protect them
and provide for them. For in these things I delight. God delights to
show kindness and to execute judgment himself, and is pleased with those
who herein are followers of him as dear children. Those that have such
knowledge of the glory of God as to be changed into the same image, and
to partake of his holiness, find it to be their perfection and glory;
and the God they thus faithfully conform to they may cheerfully confide
in, in their greatest straits. But the prophet intimates that the
generality of this people took no care about this. Their wisdom, and
might, and riches, were their joy and hope, which would end in grief and
despair. But those few among them that had the knowledge of God might
please themselves with it, and boast themselves of it; it would stand
them in better stead than thousands of gold and silver.

II\. When they were told how provoking their sins were to God they
vainly pleaded the covenant of their circumcision. They were undoubtedly
the people of God; as they had the temple of the Lord in their city, so
they had the mark of his children in their flesh. "It is true that
Chaldean army has laid such and such nations waste, because they were
uncircumcised, and therefore not under the protection of the divine
providence, as we are." To this the prophet answers, That the days of
visitation were now at hand, in which God would punish all wicked
people, without making any distinction between the circumcised and
uncircumcised, [Jer 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#025.md), [Jer
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#026.md). They had by sin profaned the
crown of their peculiarity, and lived in common with the uncircumcised
nations, and so had forfeited the benefit of that peculiarity and must
expect to fare never the better for it. God will punish the circumcised
with the uncircumcised. As the ignorance of the uncircumcised shall not
excuse their wickedness, so neither shall the privileges of the
circumcised excuse theirs, but they shall be punished together. Note,
The Judge of all the earth is impartial, and none shall fare the better
at his bar for any external advantages, but he will render to every man,
circumcised or uncircumcised, according to his works. The condemnation
of impenitent sinners that are baptized will be as sure as, nay, and
more severe than, that of impenitent sinners that are unbaptized. It
would affect one to find here Judah industriously put between Egypt and
Edom, as standing upon a level with them and under the same doom, [Jer
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#026.md). These nations were forbidden a
share in the Jews' privileges ([Deu
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003).md); but the Jews are here told that
they shall share in their punishments. Those in the utmost corners, that
dwell in the wilderness, are supposed to be the Kedarenes and those of
the kingdoms of Hazor, as appears by comparing [Jer
49:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#028.md). Some think they are so
called because they dwelt as it were in a corner of the world, others
because they had the hair of their head polled into corners. However
that was, they were of those nations that were uncircumcised in flesh,
and the Jews are ranked with them and are as near to ruin for their sins
as they; for all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart:
they have the sign, but not the thing signified, [Jer
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#004.md). They are heathens in their
hearts, strangers to God, and enemies in their minds by wicked works.
Their hearts are disposed to idols, as the hearts of the uncircumcised
Gentiles are. Note, The seals of the covenant, though they dignify us,
and lay us under obligations, will not save us, unless the temper of our
minds and the tenour of our lives agree with the covenant. That only is
circumcision, and that baptism, which is of the heart, [Rom
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028.md), [Rom
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029.md).
