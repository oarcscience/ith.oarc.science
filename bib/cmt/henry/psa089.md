### [Psalms Chapter 89](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 89:0</span></span>

Many psalms that begin with complaint and prayer end with joy and
praise, but this begins with joy and praise and ends with sad complaints
and petitions; for the psalmist first recounts God's former favours, and
then with the consideration of them aggravates the present grievances.
It is uncertain when it was penned; only, in general, that it was at a
time when the house of David was woefully eclipsed; some think it was at
the time of the captivity of Babylon, when king Zedekiah was insulted
over, and abused, by Nebuchadnezzar, and then they make the title to
signify no more than that the psalm was set to the tune of a song of
Ethan the son of Zerah, called Maschil; others suppose it to be penned
by Ethan, who is mentioned in the story of Solomon, who, outliving that
glorious prince, thus lamented the great disgrace done to the house of
David in the next reign by the revolt of the ten tribes. I. The
psalmist, in the joyful pleasant part of the psalm, gives glory to God,
and takes comfort to himself and his friends. This he does more briefly,
mentioning God's mercy and truth ([Psa
89:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#001).md) and his covenant ([Psa
89:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#002).md), but more largely in the
following verses, wherein, 1. He adores the glory and perfection of God
([Psa 89:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#005).md). 2. He pleases himself
in the happiness of those that are admitted into communion with him
([Psa 89:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#015).md). 3. He builds all his
hope upon God's covenant with David, as a type of Christ (v. 19-37). II.
In the melancholy part of the psalm he laments the present calamitous
state of the prince and royal family ([Psa
89:38-45](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#038).md), expostulates with God upon
it ([Psa 89:46-49](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#046).md), and then concludes
with prayer for redress ([Psa 89:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#050.md),
[Psa 89:51](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#051).md). In singing this psalm we
must have high thoughts of God, a lively faith in his covenant with the
Redeemer, and a sympathy with the afflicted parts of the church.

Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite.

[Psalms 89:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 89:1</span></span>

The psalmist has a very sad complaint to make of the deplorable
condition of the family of David at this time, and yet he begins the
psalm with songs of praise; for we must, in every thing, in every state,
give thanks; thus we must glorify the Lord in the fire. We think, when
we are in trouble, that we get ease by complaining; but we do more - we
get joy, by praising. Let our complaints therefore be turned into
thanksgivings; and in these verses we find that which will be matter of
praise and thanksgiving for us in the worst of times, whether upon a
personal or a public account, 1. However it be, the everlasting God is
good and true, [Psa 89:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#001.md). Though we
may find it hard to reconcile present dark providences with the goodness
and truth of God, yet we must abide by this principle, That God's
mercies are inexhaustible and his truth is inviolable; and these must be
the matter of our joy and praise: "I will sing of the mercies of the
Lord for ever, sing a praising song to God's honour, a pleasant song for
my own solace, and Maschil, an instructive song, for the edification of
others." We may be for ever singing God's mercies, and yet the subject
will not be drawn dry. We must sing of God's mercies as long as we live,
train up others to sing of them when we are gone, and hope to be singing
them in heaven world without end; and this is singing of the mercies of
the Lord for ever. With my mouth, and with my pen (for by that also do
we speak), will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations,
assuring posterity, from my own observation and experience, that God is
true to every word that he has spoken, that they may learn to put their
trust in God, [Psa 78:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#006.md). 2. However it
be, the everlasting covenant is firm and sure, [Psa
89:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#002). Here we have, (1..md) The
psalmist's faith and hope: "Things now look black, and threaten the
utter extirpation of the house of David; but I have said, and I have
warrant from the word of God to say it, that mercy shall be built up for
ever." As the goodness of God's nature is to be the matter of our song
([Psa 89:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#001).md), so much more the mercy
that is built for us in the covenant; it is still increasing, like a
house in the building up, and shall still continue our rest for ever,
like a house built up. It shall be built up for ever; for the
everlasting habitations we hope for in the new Jerusalem are of this
building. If mercy shall be built for ever, then the tabernacle of
David, which has fallen down, shall be raised out of its ruins, and
built up as in the days of old, [Amo
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011.md). Therefore mercy shall be built
up for ever, because thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very
heavens. Though our expectations are in some particular instances
disappointed, yet God's promises are not disannulled; they are
established in the very heavens (that is, in his eternal counsels); they
are above the changes of this lower region and out of the reach of the
opposition of hell and earth. The stability of the material heavens is
an emblem of the truth of God's word; the heavens may be clouded by
vapours arising out of the earth, but they cannot be touched, they
cannot be changed. (2.) An abstract of the covenant upon which this
faith and hope are built: I have said it, says the psalmist, for God
hath sworn it, that the heirs of promise might be entirely satisfied of
the immutability of his counsel. He brings in God speaking ([Psa
89:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#003).md), owning, to the comfort of his
people, "I have made a covenant, and therefore will make it good." The
covenant is made with David; the covenant of royalty is made with him,
as the father of his family, and with his seed through him and for his
sake, representing the covenant of grace made with Christ as head of the
church and with all believers as his spiritual seed. David is here
called God's chosen and his servant; and, as God is not changeable to
recede from his own choice, so he is not unrighteous to cast off one
that served him. Two things encourage the psalmist to build his faith on
this covenant: - \[1.\] The ratification of it; it was confirmed with an
oath: The Lord has sworn, and he will not repent. \[2.\] The perpetuity
of it; the blessings of the covenant were not only secured to David
himself, but were entailed on his family; it was promised that his
family should continue - Thy seed will I establish for ever, so that
David shall not want a son to reign ([Jer
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#020.md), [Jer
33:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#021).md); and that it should continue a
royal family - I will build up thy throne to all generations, to all the
generations of time. This has its accomplishment only in Christ, of the
seed of David, who lives for ever, to whom God has given the throne of
his father David, and of the increase of whose government and peace
there shall be no end. Of this covenant the psalmist will return to
speak more largely, [Psa 89:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#019.md), etc.

[Psalms 89:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 89:5</span></span>

These verses are full of the praises of God. Observe,

I. Where, and by whom, God is to be praised. 1. God is praised by the
angels above: The heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Lord! [Psa
89:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#005.md); that is, "the glorious
inhabitants of the upper world continually celebrate thy praises." Bless
the Lord, you his angels, [Psa 103:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#020.md).
The works of God are wonders even to those that are best acquainted and
most intimately conversant with them; the more God's works are known the
more they are admired and praised. This should make us love heaven, and
long to be there, that there we shall have nothing else to do but to
praise God and his wonders. 2. God is praised by the assemblies of his
saints on earth (praise waits for him in Zion); and, though their
praises fall so far short of the praises of angels, yet God is pleased
to take notice of them, and accept of them, and reckon himself honoured
by them. "Thy faithfulness and the truth of thy promise, that rock on
which the church is built, shall be praised in the congregation of the
saints, who owe their all to that faithfulness, and whose constant
comfort it is that there is a promise, and that he is faithful who has
promised." It is expected from God's saints on earth that they praise
him; who should, if they do not? Let every saint praise him, but
especially the congregation of saints; when they come together, let them
join in praising God. The more the better; it is the more like heaven.
Of the honour done to God by the assembly of the saints he speaks again
([Psa 89:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#007).md): God is greatly to be
feared in the assembly of the saints. Saints should assemble for
religious worship, that they may publicly own their relation to God and
may stir up one another to give honour to him, and, in keeping up
communion with God, may likewise maintain the communion of saints. In
religious assemblies God has promised the presence of his grace, but we
must also, in them, have an eye to his glorious presence, that the
familiarity we are admitted to may not breed the least contempt; for he
is terrible in his holy places, and therefore greatly to be feared. A
holy awe of God must fall upon us, and fill us, in all our approaches to
God, even in secret, to which something may very well be added by the
solemnity of public assemblies. God must be had in reverence of all that
are about him, that attend him continually as his servants or approach
him upon any particular errand. See [Lev
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003.md). Those only serve God acceptably
who serve him with reverence and godly fear, [Heb
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#028.md).

II\. What it is to praise God; it is to acknowledge him to be a being of
unparalleled perfection, such a one that there is none like him, nor any
to be compared with him, [Psa 89:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#006.md). If
there be any beings that can pretend to vie with God, surely they must
be found among the angels; but they are all infinitely short of him: Who
in the heaven can be compared with the Lord, so as to challenge any
share of the reverence and adoration which are due to him only, or to
set up in rivalship with him for the homage of the children of men? They
are sons of the mighty, but which of them can be likened unto the Lord?
Nobles are princes' peers; some parity there is between them. But there
is none between God and the angels; they are not his peers. To whom will
you liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One, [Isa
40:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#025.md). This is insisted on again ([Psa
89:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#008).md): Who is a strong Lord like unto
thee? No angel, no earthly potentate, whatsoever, is comparable to God,
or has an arm like him, or can thunder with a voice like him. Thy
faithfulness is round about thee; that is, "thy angels who are round
about thee, attending thee with their praises and ready to go on thy
errands, are all faithful." Or, rather, "In every thing thou doest, on
all sides, thou approvest thyself faithful to thy word, above whatever
prince or potentate was." Among men it is too often found that those who
are most able to break their word are least careful to keep it; but God
is both strong and faithful; he can do every thing, and yet will never
do an unjust thing.

III\. What we ought, in our praises, to give God the glory of. Several
things are here mentioned. 1. The command God has of the most
ungovernable creatures ([Psa 89:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#009).md):
Thou rulest the raging of the sea, than which nothing is more frightful
or threatening, nor more out of the power of man to give check to; it
can swell no higher, roll no further, beat no harder, continue no
longer, nor do any more hurt, than God suffers it. "When the waves
thereof arise thou canst immediately hush them asleep, still them, and
make them quiet, and turn the storm into a calm." This coming in here as
an act of omnipotence, what manner of man then was the Lord Jesus, whom
the winds and seas obeyed? 2. The victories God has obtained over the
enemies of his church. His ruling the raging of the sea and quelling its
billows was an emblem of this ([Psa
89:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#010).md): Thou hast broken Rahab, many a
proud enemy (so it signifies), Egypt in particular, which is sometimes
called Rahab, broken it in pieces, as one that is slain and utterly
unable to make head again. "The head being broken, thou hast scattered
the remainder with the arm of thy strength." God has more ways than one
to deal with his and his church's enemies. We think he should slay them
immediately, but sometimes he scatters them, that he may send them
abroad to be monuments of his justice, [Psa
59:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#011.md). The remembrance of the breaking
of Egypt in pieces is a comfort to the church, in reference to the
present power of Babylon; for God is still the same. 3. The
incontestable property he has in all the creatures of the upper and
lower world ([Psa 89:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#011.md), [Psa
89:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#012).md): "Men are honoured for their
large possessions; but the heavens are thine, O Lord! the earth also is
thine; therefore we praise thee, therefore we trust in thee, therefore
we will not fear what man can do against us. The world and the fulness
thereof, all the riches contained in it, all the inhabitants of it, both
the tenements and the tenants, are all thine; for thou hast founded
them," and the founder may justly claim to be the owner. He specifies,
(1.) The remotest parts of the world, the north and south, the countries
that lie under the two poles, which are uninhabited and little known:
"Thou hast created them, and therefore knowest them, takest care of
them, and hast tributes of praise from them." The north is said to be
hung over the empty place; yet what fulness there is there God is the
owner of it. (2.) The highest parts of the world. He mentions the two
highest hills in Canaan - "Tabor and Hermon" (one lying to the west, the
other to the east); "these shall rejoice in thy name, for they are under
the care of thy providence, and they produce offerings for thy altar."
The little hills are said to rejoice in their own fruitfulness, [Psa
65:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#012.md). Tabor is commonly supposed to
be that high mountain in Galilee on the top of which Christ was
transfigured; and then indeed it might be said to rejoice in that voice
which was there heard, This is my beloved Son. 4. The power and justice,
the mercy and truth, with which he governs the world and rules in the
affairs of the children of men, [Psa
89:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#013.md), [Psa
89:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#014). (1..md) God is able to do every
thing; for his is the Lord God Almighty. His arm, his hand, is mighty
and strong, both to save his people and to destroy his and their
enemies; none can either resist the force or bear the weight of his
mighty hand. High is his right hand, to reach the highest, even those
that set their nests among the stars ([Amo
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#002.md), [Amo
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#003.md); [Oba
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#004).md); his right hand is exalted in
what he has done, for in thousands of instances he has signalized his
power, [Psa 118:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#016). (2..md) He never did,
nor ever will do, any thing that is either unjust or unwise; for
righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne. None of all
his dictates or decrees ever varied from the rules of equity and wisdom,
nor could ever any charge God with unrighteousness or folly. Justice and
judgment are the preparing of his throne (so some), the establishment of
it, so others. The preparations for his government in his counsels from
eternity, and the establishment of it in its consequences to eternity,
are all justice and judgment. (3.) He always does that which is kind to
his people and consonant to the word which he has spoken: "Mercy and
truth shall go before thy face, to prepare thy way, as harbingers to
make room for thee - mercy in promising, truth in performing - truth in
being as good as thy word, mercy in being better." How praiseworthy are
these in great men, much more in the great God, in whom they are in
perfection!

[Psalms 89:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 89:15</span></span>

The psalmist, having largely shown the blessedness of the God of Israel,
here shows the blessedness of the Israel of God. As there is none like
unto the God of Jeshurun, so, happy art thou, O Israel! there is none
like unto thee, O people! especially as a type of the gospel-Israel,
consisting of all true believers, whose happiness is here described.

I. Glorious discoveries are made to them, and glad tidings of good
brought to them; they hear, they know, the joyful sound, [Psa
89:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#015.md). This may allude, 1. To the
shout of a victorious army, the shout of a king, [Num
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#021.md). Israel have the tokens of God's
presence with them in their wars; the sound of the going in the top of
the mulberry-trees was indeed a joyful sound ([Sa2
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#024).md); and they often returned making
the earth ring with their songs of triumph; these were joyful sounds.
Or, 2. To the sound that was made over the sacrifices and on the solemn
feast-day, [Psa 81:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#001.md). This was the
happiness of Israel, that they had among them the free and open
profession of God's holy religion, and abundance of joy in their
sacrifices. Or, 3. To the sound of the jubilee-trumpet; a joyful sound
it was to servants and debtors, to whom it proclaimed release. The
gospel is indeed a joyful sound, a sound of victory, of liberty, of
communion with God, and the sound of abundance of rain; blessed are the
people that hear it, and know it, and bid it welcome.

II\. Special tokens of God's favour are granted them: "They shall walk,
O Lord! in the light of thy countenance; they shall govern themselves by
thy directions, shall be guided by the eye; and they shall delight
themselves in thy consolations. They shall have the favour of God; they
shall know that they have it, and it shall be continual matter of joy
and rejoicing to them. They shall go through all the exercises of a holy
life under the powerful influences of God's lovingkindness, which shall
make their duty pleasant to them and make them sincere in it, aiming at
this, as their end, to be accepted of the Lord." We then walk in the
light of the Lord when we fetch all our comforts from God's favour and
are very careful to keep ourselves in his love.

III\. They never want matter for joy: Blessed are God's people, for in
his name, in all that whereby he has made himself known, if it be not
their own fault, they shall rejoice all the day. Those that rejoice in
Christ Jesus, and make God their exceeding joy, have enough to
counterbalance their grievances and silence their griefs; and therefore
their joy is full ([Jo1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#004).md) and
constant; it is their duty to rejoice evermore.

IV\. Their relation to God is their honour and dignity. They are happy,
for they are high. Surely in the Lord, in the Lord Christ, they have
righteousness and strength, and so are recommended by him to the divine
acceptance; and therefore in him shall all the seed of Israel glory,
[Isa 45:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024.md), [Isa
45:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#025.md). So it is here, [Psa
89:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#016.md), [Psa
89:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#017.md). 1. "In thy righteousness shall
they be exalted, and not in any righteousness of their own." We are
exalted out of danger, and into honour, purely by the righteousness of
Christ, which is a clothing both for dignity and for defence. 2. "Thou
art the glory of their strength," that is, "thou art their strength, and
it is their glory that thou art so, and what they glory in." Thanks be
to God who always causes us to triumph. 3. "In thy favour, which through
Christ we hope for, our horn shall be exalted." The horn denotes beauty,
plenty, and power; these those have who are made accepted in the
beloved. What greater preferment are men capable of in this world than
to be God's favourites?

V. Their relation to God is their protection and safety ([Psa
89:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#018).md): "For our shield is of the
Lord" (so the margin) "and our king is from the Holy One of Israel. If
God be our ruler, he will be our defender; and who is he than that can
harm us?" It was the happiness of Israel that God himself had the
erecting of their bulwarks and the nominating of their king (so some
take it); or, rather, that he was himself a wall of fire round about
them, and, as a Holy One, the author and centre of their holy religion;
he was their King, and so their glory in the midst of them. Christ is
the Holy One of Israel, that holy thing; and in nothing was that
peculiar people more blessed than in this, that he was born King of the
Jews. Now this account of the blessedness of God's Israel comes in here
as that to which it was hard to reconcile their present calamitous
state.

[Psalms 89:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 89:19</span></span>

The covenant God made with David and his seed was mentioned before ([Psa
89:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#003.md), [Psa
89:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#004).md); but in these verses it is
enlarged upon, and pleaded with God, for favour to the royal family, now
almost sunk and ruined; yet certainly it looks at Christ, and has its
accomplishment in him much more than in David; nay, some passages here
are scarcely applicable at all to David, but must be understood of
Christ only (who is therefore called David our king, [Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005).md), and very great and precious
promises they are which are here made to the Redeemer, which are strong
foundations for the faith and hope of the redeemed to build upon. The
comforts of our redemption flow from the covenant of redemption; all our
springs are in that, [Isa 55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003.md). I will
make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David,
[Act 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#034.md). Now here we have an
account of those sure mercies. Observe,

I. What assurance we have of the truth of the promise, which may
encourage us to build upon it. We are here told, 1. How it was spoken
([Psa 89:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#019).md): Thou didst speak in
vision to thy Holy One. God's promise to David, which is especially
referred to here, was spoken in vision to Nathan the prophet, [Sa2
7:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012.md). Then, when the Holy One of
Israel was their king ([Psa 89:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#018).md), he
appointed David to be his viceroy. But to all the prophets, those holy
ones, he spoke in vision concerning Christ, and to him himself
especially, who had lain in his bosom from eternity, and was made
perfectly acquainted with the whole design of redemption, [Mat
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027.md). 2. How it was sworn to and
ratified ([Psa 89:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#035).md): Once have I
sworn by my holiness, that darling attribute. In swearing by his
holiness, he swore by himself; for he will as soon cease to be as be
otherwise than holy. His swearing once is enough; he needs not swear
again, as David did ([Sa1 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#017).md); for
his word and oath are two immutable things. As Christ was made a priest,
so he was made a king, by an oath ([Heb
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#021).md); for his kingdom and priesthood
are both unchangeable.

II\. The choice made of the person to whom the promise is given, [Psa
89:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#019.md), [Psa
89:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#020.md). David was a king of God's own
choosing, so is Christ, and therefore both are called God's kings, [Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md). David was mighty, a man of
courage and fit for business; he was chosen out of the people, not out
of the princes, but the shepherds. God found him out, exalted him, laid
help upon him, and ordered Samuel to anoint him. But this is especially
to be applied to Christ. 1. He is one that is mighty, every way
qualified for the great work he was to undertake, able to save to the
uttermost - mighty in strength, for he is the Son of God - mighty in
love, for he is able experimentally to compassionate those that are
tempted. He is the mighty God, [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md). 2. He is chosen out of the
people, one of us, bone of our bone, that takes part with us of flesh
and blood. Being ordained for men, he is taken from among men, that his
terror might not make us afraid. 3. God has found him. He is a Saviour
of God's own providing; for the salvation, from first to last, is purely
the Lord's doing. He has found the ransom, [Job
33:24](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#024.md). We could never have found a
person fit to undertake this great work, [Rev
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#003.md), [Rev
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#004.md). 4. God has laid help upon him,
not only helped him, but treasured up help in him for us, laid it as a
charge upon him to help fallen man up again, to help the chosen remnant
to heaven. In me is thy help, [Hos
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#009.md). 5. He has exalted him, by
constituting him the prophet, priest, and king of his church, clothing
him with power, raising him from the dead, and setting him at his own
right hand. Whom God chooses and uses he will exalt. 6. He has anointed
him, has qualified him for his office, and so confirmed him in it, by
giving him the Spirit, not by measure, but without measure, infinitely
above his fellows. He is called Messiah, or Christ, the Anointed. 7. In
all this he designed him to be his own servant, for the accomplishing of
his eternal purpose and the advancement of the interests of his kingdom
among men.

III\. The promises made to this chosen one, to David in the type and the
Son of David in the antitype, in which not only gracious, but glorious
things are spoken of him.

1\. With reference to himself, as king and God's servant: and what makes
for him makes for all his loving subjects. It is here promised, (1.)
That God would stand by him and strengthen him in his undertaking ([Psa
89:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#021).md): With him my hand not only
shall be, but shall be established, by promise, shall be so established
that he shall by it be established and confirmed in all his offices, so
that none of them shall be undermined and overthrown, though by the man
of sin they shall all be usurped and fought against. Christ had a great
deal of hard work to do and hard usage to go through; but he that gave
him commission gave him forces sufficient for the execution of his
commission: "My arm also shall strengthen him to break through and bear
up under all his difficulties." No good work can miscarry in the hand of
those whom God himself undertakes to strengthen. (2.) That he should be
victorious over his enemies, that they should not encroach upon him
([Psa 89:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#022).md): The son of wickedness
shall not exact upon him, nor afflict him. He that at first broke the
peace would set himself against him that undertook to make peace, and do
what he could to blast his design: but he could only reach to bruise his
heel; further he could not exact upon him nor afflict him. Christ became
a surety for our debt, and thereby Satan and death thought to gain
advantage against him; but he satisfied the demands of God's justice,
and then they could not exact upon him. The prince of this world cometh,
but he has nothing in me, [Joh 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030.md).
Nay, they not only shall not prevail against him, but they shall fall
before him ([Psa 89:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#023).md): I will bend
down his foes before his face; the prince of this world shall be cast
out, principalities and powers spoiled, and he shall be the death of
death itself, and the destruction of the grave, [Hos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014.md). Some apply this to the ruin
which God brought upon the Jewish nation, that persecuted Christ and put
him to death. But all Christ's enemies, who hate him and will not have
him to reign over them, shall be brought forth and slain before him,
[Luk 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#027). (3..md) That he should be the
great trustee of the covenant between God and men, that God would be
gracious and true to us ([Psa 89:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#024).md):
My faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him. They were with David;
God continued merciful to him, and so approved himself faithful. They
were with Christ; God made good all his promises to him. But that is not
all; God's mercy to us, and his faithfulness to us, are with Christ; he
is not only pleased with him, but with us in him; and it is in him that
all the promises of God are yea and amen. So that if any poor sinners
hope for benefit by the faithfulness and mercy of God, let them know it
is with Christ; it is lodged in his hand, and to him they must apply for
it ([Psa 89:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#028).md): My mercy will I keep
for him, to be disposed of by him, for evermore; in the channel of
Christ's mediation all the streams of divine goodness will for ever run.
Therefore it is the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ which we look for
unto eternal life, [Jde 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#021.md); [Joh
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#002.md). And, as the mercy of God flows
to us through him, so the promise of God is, through him, firm to us: My
covenant shall stand fast with him, both the covenant of redemption made
with him and the covenant of grace made with us in him. The new covenant
is therefore always new, and firmly established, because it is lodged in
the hands of a Mediator, [Heb 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006.md). The
covenant stands fast, because it stands upon this basis. And this
redounds to the everlasting honour of the Lord Jesus, that to him the
great cause between God and man is entirely referred and the Father has
committed all judgment to him, that all men might honour him ([Joh
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022.md), [Joh
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#023).md); therefore it is here said, In
my name shall his horn be exalted; this shall be his glory, that God's
name is in him ([Exo 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#021).md), and that
he acts in God's name. As the Father gave me commandment, so I do. (4.)
That his kingdom should be greatly enlarged ([Psa
89:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#025).md): I will set his hand in the sea
(he shall have the dominion of the seas, and the isles of the sea), and
his right hand in the rivers, the inland countries that are watered with
rivers. David's kingdom extended itself to the Great Sea, and the Red
Sea, to the river of Egypt and the river Euphrates. But it is in the
kingdom of the Messiah that this has its full accomplishment, and shall
have more and more, when the kingdoms of this world shall become the
kingdoms of the Lord and of his Christ ([Rev
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015).md), and the isles shall wait for
his law. (5.) That he should own God as his Father, and God would own
him as his Son, his firstborn, [Psa
89:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#026.md), [Psa
89:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#027.md). This is a comment upon these
words in Nathan's message concerning Solomon (for he also was a type of
Christ as well as David), I will be his Father and he shall be my Son
([Sa2 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014).md), and the relation shall be
owned on both sides. \[1.\] He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father. It
is probable that Solomon did so; but we are sure Christ did so, in the
days of his flesh, when he offered up strong cries to God, and called
him holy Father, righteous Father, and taught us to address ourselves to
him as our Father in heaven. Christ, in his agony, cried unto God, Thou
art my Father ([Mat 26:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#039.md), [Mat
26:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#042), O my Father.md), and, upon the
cross, Father, forgive them; Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.
He looked upon him likewise as his God, and therefore he perfectly
obeyed him, and submitted to his will in his whole undertaking (he ismy
God and your God, [Joh 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017).md), and as
the rock of his salvation, who would bear him up and bear him out in his
undertaking, and make him more than a conqueror, even a complete
Saviour; and therefore with an undaunted resolution he endured the
cross, despising the shame, for he knew he should be both justified and
glorified. \[2.\] I will make him my firstborn. I see not how this can
be applied to David; it is Christ's prerogative to be the firstborn of
every creature, and, as such, the heir of all things, [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md); [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md), [Heb
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006.md). When all power was given to
Christ both in heaven and in earth, and all things were delivered unto
him by the Father, then god made him his firstborn, and far higher, more
great and honourable, than the kings of the earth; for he is the King of
kings, angels, authorities, and powers, being made subject to him, [Pe1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#022.md).

2\. With reference to his seed. God's covenants always took in the seed
of the covenanters; this does so ([Psa
89:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#029.md), [Psa
89:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#036).md): His seed shall endure for
ever, and with it his throne. Now this will be differently understood
according as we apply it to Christ or David.

(1.) If we apply it to David, by his seed we are to understand his
successors, Solomon and the following kings of Judah, who descended from
the loins of David. It is supposed that they might degenerate, and not
walk in the spirit and steps of their father David; in such a case they
must expect to come under divine rebukes, such as the house of David was
at this time under, [Psa 89:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#038.md). But
let this encourage them, that, though they were corrected, they should
not be abandoned or disinherited. This refers to that part of Nathan's
message ([Sa2 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014.md), [Sa2
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#015).md), If he commit iniquity, I will
chasten him, but my mercy shall not depart from him. Thus far David's
seed and throne did endure for ever, that, notwithstanding the
wickedness of many of his posterity, who were the scandals of his house,
yet his family continued, and continued in the imperial dignity, a very
long time, - that, as long as Judah continued a kingdom, David's
posterity were kings of it, and the royalty of that kingdom was never in
any other family, as that of the ten tribes was, in Jeroboam's first,
then in Baasha's, etc., - and that the family of David continued a
family of distinction till that Son of David came whose throne should
endure for ever; see [Luk 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#027.md), [Luk
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032.md); [Luk
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#004.md), [Luk
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#011.md). If David's posterity, in
after-times, should forsake God and their duty and revolt to the ways of
sin, God would bring desolating judgments upon them and ruin the family;
and yet he would not take away his lovingkindness from David, nor break
his covenant with him; for, in the Messiah, who should come out of his
loins, all these promises shall have their accomplishment to the full.
Thus, when the Jews were rejected, the apostle shows that God's covenant
with Abraham was not broken, because it was fulfilled in his spiritual
seed, the heirs of the righteousness of faith, [Rom
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#007.md).

(2.) If we apply it to Christ, by his seed we are to understand his
subjects, all believers, his spiritual seed, the children which God has
given him, [Heb 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013.md). This is that
seed which shall be made to endure for ever, and his throne in the midst
of them, in the church in the heart, as the days of heaven. To the end
Christ shall have a people in the world to serve and honour him. He
shall see his seed; he shall prolong his days. This holy seed shall
endure for ever in a glorified state, when time and days shall be no
more; and thus Christ's throne and kingdom shall be perpetuated: the
kingdom of his grace shall continue through all the ages of time and the
kingdom of his glory to the endless ages of eternity.

\[1.\] The continuance of Christ's kingdom is here made doubtful by the
sins and afflictions of his subjects; their iniquities and calamities
threaten the ruin of it. This case is here put, that we may not be
offended when it comes to be a case in fact, but that we may reconcile
it with the stability of the covenant and be assured of that
notwithstanding. First, It is here supposed that there will be much
amiss in the subjects of Christ's kingdom. His children may forsake
God's law ([Psa 89:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#030).md) by omissions,
and break his statutes ([Psa 89:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#031).md) by
commissions. There are spots which are the spots of God's children, [Deu
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#005.md). Many corruptions there are in
the bowels of the church, as well as in the hearts of those who are the
members of it, and these corruptions break out. Secondly, They are here
told that they must smart for it ([Psa
89:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#032).md): I will visit their
transgression with a rod, their transgression sooner than that of
others. You only have I known, and therefore I will punish you, [Amo
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#002.md). Their being related to Christ
shall not excuse them from being called to an account. But observe what
affliction is to God's people. 1. It is but a rod, not an axe, not a
sword; it is for correction, not for destruction. This denotes
gentleness in the affliction; it is the rod of men, such a rod as men
use in correcting their children; and it denotes a design of good in and
by the affliction, such a rod as yields the peaceable fruit of
righteousness. 2. It is a rod on the hand of God (I will visit them), he
who is wise, and knows what he does, gracious, and will do what is best.
3. It is a rod which they shall never feel the smart of but when there
is great need: If they break my law, then I will visit their
transgression with the rod, but not else. Then it is requisite that
God's honour be vindicated, and that they be humbled and reduced.

\[2.\] The continuance of Christ's kingdom is made certain by the
inviolable promise and oath of God, notwithstanding all this ([Psa
89:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#033).md): Nevertheless, my kindness will
I not totally and finally take from him. First, "Notwithstanding their
provocations, yet my covenant shall not be broken." Note, Afflictions
are not only consistent with covenant-love, but to the people of God
they flow from it. Though David's seed be chastened, it does not follow
that they are disinherited; they may be cast down, but they are not cast
off. God's favour is continued to his people, 1. For Christ's sake; in
him the mercy is laid up for us, and God says, I will not take it from
him ([Psa 89:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#033).md), I will not lie unto
David, [Psa 89:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#035.md). We are unworthy,
but he is worthy. 2. For the covenant's sake: My faithfulness shall not
fail, my covenant will I not break. It was supposed that they had broken
God's statutes, profaned and polluted them (so the word signifies);
"But," says God, "I will not break, I will not profane and pollute, my
covenant;" it is the same word. That which is said and sworn is that God
will have a church in the world as long as sun and moon endure, [Psa
89:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#036.md), [Psa
89:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#037.md). The sun and moon are faithful
witnesses in heaven of the wisdom, power, and goodness of the Creator,
and shall continue while time lasts, which they are the measurers of;
but the seed of Christ shall be established for ever, as lights of the
world while the world stands, to shine in it, and, when it is at an end,
they shall be established lights shining in the firmament of the Father.

[Psalms 89:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">psa 89:38</span></span>

In these verses we have,

I. A very melancholy complaint of the present deplorable state of
David's family, which the psalmist thinks hard to be reconciled to the
covenant God made with David. "Thou saidst thou wouldst not take away
thy lovingkindness, but thou hast cast off." Sometimes, it is no easy
thing to reconcile God's providences with his promises, and yet we are
sure they are reconcilable; for God's works fulfil his word and never
contradict it. 1. David's house seemed to have lost its interest in God,
which was the greatest strength and beauty of it. God had been pleased
with his anointed, but now he was wroth with him ([Psa
89:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#038).md), had entered into covenant with
the family, but now, for aught he could perceive, he had made void the
covenant, not broken some of the articles of it, but cancelled it, [Psa
89:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#039.md). We misconstrue the rebukes of
Providence if we think they make void the covenant. When the great
anointed one, Christ himself, was upon the cross, God seemed to have
cast him off, and was wroth with him, and yet did not make void his
covenant with him, for that was established for ever. 2. The honour of
the house of David was lost and laid in the dust: Thou hast profaned his
crown (which was always looked upon as sacred) by casting it to the
ground, to be trampled on, [Psa 89:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#039.md).
Thou hast made his glory to cease (so uncertain is all earthly glory,
and so soon does it wither) and thou hast cast his throne down to the
ground, not only dethroned the king, but put a period to the kingdom,
[Psa 89:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#044.md). If it was penned in
Rehoboam's time, it was true as to the greatest part of the kingdom,
five parts of six; if in Zedekiah's time, it was more remarkably true of
the poor remainder. Note, Thrones and crowns are tottering things, and
are often laid in the dust; but there is a crown of glory reserved for
Christ's spiritual seed which fadeth not away. 3. It was exposed and
made a prey to all the neighbours, who insulted over that ancient and
honourable family ([Psa 89:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#040).md): Thou
hast broken down all his hedges (all those things that were a defence to
them, and particularly that hedge of protection which they thought God's
covenant and promise had made about them) and thou hast made even his
strong-holds a ruin, so that they were rather a reproach to them than
any shelter; and then, All that pass by the way spoil him ([Psa
89:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#041).md) and make an easy prey of him;
see [Psa 80:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#012.md), [Psa
80:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#013.md). The enemies talk insolently: He
is a reproach to his neighbours, who triumph in his fall from so great a
degree of honour. Nay, every one helps forward the calamity ([Psa
89:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#042).md): "Thou hast set up the right
hand of his adversaries, not only given them power, but inclined them to
turn their power this way." If the enemies of the church lift up their
hand against it, we must see God setting up their hand; for they could
have no power unless it were given them from above. But, when God does
permit them to do mischief to his church, it pleases them: "Thou hast
made all his enemies to rejoice; and this is for thy glory, that those
who hate thee should have the pleasure to see the tears and troubles of
those that love thee." 4. It was disabled to help itself ([Psa
89:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#043).md): "Thou hast turned the edge of
his sword, and made it blunt, that it cannot do execution as it has
done; and (which is worse) thou hast turned the edge of his spirit, and
taken off his courage, and hast not made him to stand as he used to do
in the battle." The spirit of men is what the Father and former of
spirits makes them; nor can we stand with any strength or resolution
further than God is pleased to uphold us. If men's hearts fail them, it
is God that dispirits them; but it is sad with the church when those
cannot stand who should stand up for it. 5. It was upon the brink of an
inglorious exit ([Psa 89:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#045).md): The days
of his youth hast thou shortened; it is ready to be cut off, like a
young man in the flower of his age. This seems to intimate that the
psalm was penned in Rehoboam's time, when the house of David was but in
the days of its youth, and yet waxed old and began to decay already.
Thus it was covered with shame, and it was turned very much to its
reproach that a family which, in the first and second reign, looked so
great, and made such a figure, should, in the third, dwindle and look so
little as the house of David did in Rehoboam's time. But it may be
applied to the captivity in Babylon, which, in comparison with what was
expected, was but the day of the youth of that kingdom. However, the
kings then had remarkably the days of their youth shortened, for it was
in the days of their youth, when they were about thirty years old, that
Jehoiachin and Zedekiah were carried captives to Babylon.

From all this complaint let us learn, 1. What work sin makes with
families, noble royal families, with families in which religion has been
uppermost; when posterity degenerates, it falls into disgrace, and
iniquity stains their glory. 2. How apt we are to place the promised
honour and happiness of the church in something external, and to think
the promise fails, and the covenant is made void, if we be disappointed
of that, a mistake which we now are inexcusable if we fall into, since
our Master has so expressly told us that his kingdom is not of this
world.

II\. A very pathetic expostulation with God upon this. Four things they
plead with God for mercy: -

1\. The long continuance of the trouble ([Psa
89:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#046).md): How long, O Lord! wilt thou
hide thyself? For ever? That which grieved them most was that God
himself, as one displeased, did not appear to them by his prophets to
comfort them, did not appear for them by his providences to deliver
them, and that he had kept them long in the dark; it seemed an eternal
night, when God had withdrawn: Thou hidest thyself for ever. Nay, God
not only hid himself from them, but seemed to set himself against them:
"Shall thy wrath burn like fire? How long shall it burn? Shall it never
be put out? What is hell, but the wrath of God, burning for ever? And is
that the lot of thy anointed?"

2\. The shortness of life, and the certainty of death: "Lord, let thy
anger cease, and return thou, in mercy to us, remembering how short my
time is and how sure the period of my time. Lord, since my life is so
transitory, and will, ere long, be at an end, let it not be always so
miserable that I should rather choose no being at all than such a
being." Job pleads thus, [Job 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#020.md),
[Job 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021.md). And probably the psalmist
here urges it in the name of the house of David, and the present prince
of that house, the days of whose youth were shortened, [Psa
89:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#045.md).

(1.) He pleads the shortness and vanity of life ([Psa
89:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#047).md): Remember how short my time is,
how transitory I am (say some), therefore unable to bear the power of
thy wrath, and therefore a proper object of thy pity. Wherefore hast
thou made all men in vain? or, Unto what vanity hast thou created all
the sons of Adam! Now, this may be understood either, \[1.\] As
declaring a great truth. If the ancient lovingkindnesses spoken of ([Psa
89:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#049).md) be forgotten (those relating to
another life), man is indeed made in vain. Considering man as mortal, if
there were not a future state on the other side of death, we might be
ready to think that man was made in vain, and was in vain endued with
the noble powers and faculties of reason and filled with such vast
designs and desires; but God would not make man in vain; therefore,
Lord, remember those lovingkindnesses. Or, \[2.\] As implying a strong
temptation that the psalmist was in. It is certain God has not made all
men, nor any man, in vain, [Isa 45:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#018.md).
For, First, If we think that God has made men in vain because so many
have short lives, and long afflictions, in this world, it is true that
God has made them so, but it is not true that therefore they are made in
vain. For those whose days are few and full of trouble may yet glorify
God and do some good, may keep their communion with God and get to
heaven, and then they are not made in vain. Secondly, If we think that
God has made men in vain because the most of men neither serve him nor
enjoy him, it is true that, as to themselves, they were made in vain,
better for them had they not been born than not to be born again; but it
was not owing to God that they were made in vain; it was owing to
themselves; nor are they made in vain as to him, for he has made all
things for himself, even the wicked for the day of evil, and those whom
he is not glorified by he will be glorified upon.

(2.) He pleads the universality and unavoidableness of death ([Psa
89:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#048).md): "What man" (what strong man,
so the word is) "is he that liveth and shall not see death? The king
himself, of the house of David, is not exempted from the sentence, from
the stroke. Lord, since he is under a fatal necessity of dying, let not
his whole life be made thus miserable. Shall he deliver his soul from
the hand of the grave? No, he shall not when his time has come. Let him
not therefore be delivered into the hand of the grave by the miseries of
a dying life, till his time shall come." We must learn here that death
is the end of all men; our eyes must shortly be closed to see death;
there is no discharge from that war, nor will any bail be taken to save
us from the prison of the grave. It concerns us therefore to make sure a
happiness on the other side of death and the grave, that, when we fail,
we may be received into everlasting habitations.

3\. The next plea is taken from the kindness God had for and the
covenant he made with his servant David ([Psa
89:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#049).md): "Lord, where are thy former
lovingkindnesses, which thou showedst, nay, which thou swaredst, to
David in thy truth? Wilt thou fail of doing what thou hast promised?
Wilt thou undo what thou hast done? Art not thou still the same? Why
then may not we have the benefit of the former sure mercies of David?"
God's unchangeableness and faithfulness assure us that God will not cast
off those whom he has chosen and covenanted with.

4\. The last plea is taken from the insolence of the enemies and the
indignity done to God's anointed ([Psa
89:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#050.md), [Psa
89:51](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#051).md): "Remember, Lord, the reproach,
and let it be rolled away from us and returned upon our enemies." (1.)
They were God's servants that were reproached, and the abuses done to
them reflected upon their master, especially since it was for serving
him that they were reproached. (2.) The reproach cast upon God's
servants was a very grievous burden to all that were concerned for the
honour of God: "I bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty
people, and am even overwhelmed with it; it is what I lay much to heart
and can scarcely keep up my spirits under the weight of." (3.) "They are
thy enemies who do thus reproach us; and wilt thou not appear against
them as such?" (4.) They have reproached the footsteps of thy anointed.
They reflected upon all the steps which the king had taken in the course
of his administration, tracked him in all his motions, that they might
make invidious remarks upon every thing he had said and done. Or, if we
may apply it to Christ, the Lord's Messiah, they reproached the Jews
with his footsteps, the slowness of his coming. They have reproached the
delays of the Messiah; so Dr. Hammond. They called him, He that should
come; but, because he had not yet come, because he did not now come to
deliver them out of the hands of their enemies, when they had none to
deliver them, they told them he would never come, they must give over
looking for him. The scoffers of the latter days do, in like manner,
reproach the footsteps of the Messiah when they ask, Where is the
promise of his coming? [Pe2 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003.md), [Pe2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#004.md). The reproaching of the footsteps
of the anointed some refer to the serpent's bruising the heel of the
seed of the woman, or to the sufferings of Christ's followers, who tread
in his footsteps, and are reproached for his name's sake.

III\. The psalm concludes with praise, even after this sad complaint
([Psa 89:52](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#052).md): Blessed be the Lord for
evermore, Amen, and amen. Thus he confronts the reproaches of his
enemies. The more others blaspheme God the more we should bless him.
Thus he corrects his own complaints, chiding himself for quarrelling
with God's providences and questioning his promises; let both these
sinful passions be silenced with the praises of God. However it be, yet
God is good, and we will never think hardly of him; God is true, and we
will never distrust him. Though the glory of David's house be stained
and sullied, this shall be our comfort, that God is blessed for ever,
and his glory cannot be eclipsed. If we would have the comfort of the
stability of God's promise, we must give him the praise of it; in
blessing God, we encourage ourselves. Here is a double Amen, according
to the double signification. Amen - so it is, God is blessed for ever.
Amen - be it so, let God be blessed for ever. He began the psalm with
thanksgiving, before he made his complaint ([Psa
89:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#001).md); and now he concludes it with a
doxology. Those who give God thanks for what he has done may give him
thanks also for what he will do; God will follow those with his mercies
who, in a right manner, follow him with their praises.
