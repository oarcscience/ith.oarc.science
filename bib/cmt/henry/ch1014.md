### [1 Chronicles Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 14:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have, I. David's kingdom established ([Ch1
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#001.md), [Ch1
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#002).md). II. His family built up ([Ch1
14:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#003).md). III. His enemies, the
Philistines, routed in two campaigns ([Ch1
14:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#008).md). This is repeated here from
[Sa2 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#011.md), etc.

[1 Chronicles 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 14:1</span></span>

We may observe here, 1. There is no man that has such a sufficiency in
himself but he has need of his neighbours and has reason to be thankful
for their help: David had a very large kingdom, Hiram a very little one;
yet David could not build himself a house to his mind unless Hiram
furnished him with both workmen and materials, [Ch1
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#001.md). This is a reason why we should
despise none, but, as we have opportunity, be obliging to all. 2. It is
a great satisfaction to a wise man to be settled, and to a good man to
see the special providences of God in his settlement. The people had
made David king; but he could not be easy, nor think himself happy, till
he perceived that the Lord had confirmed him king over Israel, [Ch1
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#002.md). "Who shall unfix me if God hath
fixed me?" 3. We must look upon all our advancements as designed for our
usefulness. David's kingdom was lifted up on high, not for his own sake,
that he might look great, but because of his people Israel, that he
might be a guide and protector to them. We are blessed in order that we
may be blessings. See [Gen 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002.md). We
are not born, nor do we live, for ourselves. 4. It is difficult to
thrive without growing secure and indulgent to the flesh. It was David's
infirmity that when he settled in his kingdom he took more wives ([Ch1
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#003).md), yet the numerous issue he had
added to his honour and strength. Lo, children are a heritage of the
Lord. We had an account of David's children, not only in Samuel, but in
this book ([Ch1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001), etc..md) and now
here again; for it was their honour to have such a father.

[1 Chronicles 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 14:8</span></span>

This narrative of David's triumph over the Philistines is much the same
with that, [Sa2 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#017.md), etc. 1. Let the
attack which the Philistines made upon David forbid us to be secure in
any settlement or advancement, and engage us to expect molestation in
this world. When we are most easy something or other may come to be a
terror or vexation to us. Christ's kingdom will thus be insulted by the
serpent's seed, especially when it makes any advances. 2. Let David's
enquiry of God, once and again, upon occasion of the Philistines'
invading him, direct us in all our ways to acknowledge God - in distress
to fly to him, when we are wronged to appeal to him, and, when we know
not what to do, to ask counsel at his oracles, to put ourselves under
his direction, and to beg of him to show us the right way. 3. Let
David's success encourage us to resist our spiritual enemies, in
observance of divine directions and dependence on divine strength.
Resist the devil, and he shall flee as the Philistines did before David.
4. Let the sound of the going in the tops of the mulberry trees direct
us to attend God's motions both in his providence and in the influences
of his Spirit. When we perceive God to go before us let us gird up our
loins, gird on our armour, and follow him. 5. Let David's burning the
gods of the Philistines, when they fell into his hands, teach us a holy
indignation against idolatry and all the remains of it. 6. Let David's
thankful acknowledgment of the hand of God in his successes direct us to
bring all our sacrifices of praise to God's altar. Not unto us, O Lord!
not unto us, but to thy name give glory. 7. Let the reputation which
David obtained, not only in his kingdom, but among his neighbours, be
looked upon as a type and figure of the exalted honour of the Son of
David ([Ch1 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#017).md): The fame of David
went out into all lands; he was generally talked of, and admired by all
people, and the Lord brought the fear of him upon all nations. All
looked upon him as a formidable enemy and a desirable ally. Thus has God
highly exalted our Redeemer, and given him a name above every name.
