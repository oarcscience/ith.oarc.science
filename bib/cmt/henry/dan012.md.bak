### [Daniel Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md)

[Daniel](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">dan 12:0</span></span>

After the prediction of the troubles of the Jews under Antiochus,
prefiguring the troubles of the Christian church under the
anti-christian power, we have here, I. Comforts, and very precious ones,
prescribed as cordials for the support of God's people in those times of
trouble; and they are such as may indifferently serve both for those
former times of trouble under Antiochus and those latter which were
prefigured by them ([Dan 12:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001).md). II.
A conference between Christ and an angel concerning the time of the
continuance of these events, designed for Daniel's satisfaction ([Dan
12:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#005).md). III. Daniel's enquiry for his
own satisfaction ([Dan 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#008).md). And the
answer he received to that enquiry ([Dan
12:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#009).md).

[Daniel 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 12:1</span></span>

It is usual with the prophets, when they foretel the grievances of the
church, to furnish it at the same time with proper antidotes, a remedy
for every malady. And no relief is so sovereign, of such general
application, so easily accommodated to every case, and of such powerful
efficacy, as those that are fetched from Christ and the future state;
thence the comforts here are fetched.

I. Jesus Christ shall appear his church's patron and protector: At that
time, when the persecution is at the hottest, Michael shall stand up,
[Dan 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md). The angel had told Daniel
what a firm friend Michael was to the church, [Dan
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021.md). He all along showed this
friendship in the upper world; the angels knew it; but now Michael shall
stand up in his providence, and work deliverance for the Jews, when he
sees that their power is gone, [Deu
32:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036.md). Christ is that great prince,
for he is the prince of the kings of the earth, [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md). And, if he stand up for his
church, who can be against it? But this is not all: At that time (that
is, soon after) Michael shall stand up for the working out of our
eternal salvation; the Son of God shall be incarnate, shall be
manifested to destroy the works of the devil. Christ stood for the
children of our people when he was made sin and a curse for them, stood
in their stead as a sacrifice, bore the cure for them, to bear it from
them. He stands for them in the intercession he ever lives to make
within the veil, stands up for them, and stands their friend. And after
the destruction of antichrist, of whom Antiochus was a type, Christ
shall stand at the latter day upon the earth, shall appear for the
complete redemption of all his.

II\. When Christ appears he will recompense tribulation to those that
trouble his people. There shall be a time of trouble, threatening to
all, but ruining to all the implacable enemies of God's kingdom among
men, such trouble as never was since there was a nation. This is
applicable. 1. To the destruction of Jerusalem, which Christ calls
(perhaps with an eye to this prediction) such a great tribulation as was
not since the beginning of the world to this time, [Mat
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#021.md). This the angel had spoken much
of ([Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027).md); and it happened about the same
time that Christ set up the gospel-kingdom in the world, that Michael
our prince stands up. Or, 2. To the judgment of the great day, that day
that shall burn as an oven, and consume the proud and all that do
wickedly; that will be such a day of trouble as never was to all those
whom Michael our prince stands against.

III\. He will work salvation for his people: "At that time thy people
shall be delivered, delivered from the mischief and ruin designed them
by Antiochus, even all those that were marked for preservation, that
were written among the living," [Isa
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#003.md). When Christ comes into the world
he will save his spiritual Israel from sin and hell, and will, at his
second coming, complete their salvation, even the salvation of as many
as were given him, as many as have their names in the book of life, [Rev
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#015.md). They were written there before
the world, and will be found written there at the end of the world, when
the books shall be opened.

IV\. There shall be a distinguishing resurrection of those that sleep in
the dust, [Dan 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md). 1. When God works
deliverance for his people from persecution it is a kind of
resurrection; so the Jews' release out of Babylon was represented in
vision (Eze. 37) and so the deliverance of the Jews from Antiochus, and
other restorations of the church to outward prosperity; they were as
life from the dead. Many of those who had long slept in the dust of
obscurity and calamity shall then awake, some to that life, and honour,
and comfort which will be lasting, everlasting; but to others, who, when
they return to their prosperity, will return to their iniquity, it will
be a resurrection to shame and contempt, for the prosperity of fools
will but expose them and destroy them. 2. When, upon the appearing of
Michael our prince, his gospel is preached, many of those who sleep in
the dust, both Jews and Gentiles, shall be awakened by it to take upon
them a profession of religion, and shall rise out of their heathenism or
Judaism; but, since there will be always a mixture of hypocrites with
true saints, it is but some of those who are raised to life to whom the
gospel is a savour of life unto life, but others will be raised by it to
shame and contempt, to whom the gospel of Christ will be a savour of
death unto death, and Christ himself set for their fall. The net of the
gospel encloses both good and bad. But, 3. It must be meant of the
general resurrection at the last day: The multitude of those that sleep
in the dust shall awake, that is, all, which shall be a great many. Or,
Of those that sleep in the dust many shall arise to life and many to
shame. The Jews themselves understand this of the resurrection of the
dead at the end of time; and Christ seems to have an eye to it when he
speaks of the resurrection of life and the resurrection of damnation
([Joh 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#029).md); and upon this the Jews
are said by St. Paul to expect a resurrection of the dead both of the
just and of the unjust, [Act 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#015.md).
And nothing could come in more seasonably here, for, under Antiochus's
persecution, some basely betrayed their religion, others bravely adhered
to it. Now it would be a trouble to them that, when the storm was over,
they could neither reward the one nor punish the other; this therefore
would be a satisfaction to them, that they would both be recompensed
according to their works in the resurrection. And the apostle, speaking
of the pious Jews that suffered martyrdom under Antiochus, tells us that
though they were tortured yet they accepted not deliverance, because
they hoped to obtain this better resurrection, [Heb
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#035.md).

V. There shall be a glorious reward conferred on those who, in the day
of trouble and distress, being themselves wise, did instruct many. Such
were taken particular notice of in the prophecy of the persecution ([Dan
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#033).md), that they should do eminent
service, and yet should fall by the sword and by flame; now, if there
were not another life after this, they would be of all men most
miserable, and therefore we are here assured that they shall be
recompensed in the resurrection of the just ([Dan
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003).md): Those that are wise (that are
teachers, so some read it, for teachers have need of wisdom, and those
that have wisdom themselves should communicate it to others) shall shine
as the brightness of the firmament, shall shine in glory, heavenly
glory, the glory of the upper world; and those that by the wisdom they
have, and the instructions they give, are instrumental to turn any,
especially to turn many to righteousness, shall shine as the stars for
ever and ever. Note, 1. There is a glory reserved for all the saints in
the future state, for all that are wise, wise for their souls and
eternity. A man's wisdom now makes his face to shine ([Ecc
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001).md), but much more will it do so in
that state where its power shall be perfected and its services rewarded.
2. The more good any do in this world, especially to the souls of men,
the greater will be their glory and reward in the other world. Those
that turn men to righteousness, that turn sinners from the errors of
their ways and help to save their souls from death ([Jam
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#020).md), will share in the glory of
those they have helped to heaven, which will be a great addition to
their own glory. 3. Ministers of Christ, who have obtained mercy of him
to be faithful and successful, and so are made burning and shining
lights in this world, shall shine very brightly in the other world,
shall shine as the stars. Christ is the sun, the fountain, of the lights
both of grace and glory; ministers, as stars, shine in both, with a
light derived from him, and a diminutive light in comparison of him; yet
to those that are earthen vessels it will be a glory infinitely
transcending their deserts. They shall shine as the stars of different
magnitudes, some in less, others in greater lustre; but, whereas the day
is coming when the stars shall fall from heaven as leaves in autumn,
these stars shall shine for ever and ever, shall never set, never be
eclipsed.

VI\. That this prophecy of those times, though sealed up now, would be
of great use to those that should live then, [Dan
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#004.md). Daniel must now shut up the
words and seal the book because the time would be long ere these things
would be accomplished: and it was some comfort that the Jewish nation,
though, in the infancy of their return from Babylon, while they were few
and weak, they met with obstructions in their work, were not persecuted
for their religion till a long time after, when they had grown to some
strength and maturity. He must seal the book because it would not be
understood, and therefore would not be regarded, till the things
contained in it were accomplished; but he must keep it safely, as a
treasure of great value, laid up for the ages to come, to whom it would
be of great service; for many shall then run to and fro, and knowledge
shall be increased. Then this hidden treasure shall be opened, and many
shall search into it, and dig for the knowledge of it, as for silver.
They shall run to and fro, to enquire out copies of it, shall collate
them, and see that they be true and authentic. They shall read it over
and over, shall meditate upon it, and run it over in their minds;
discurrent - they shall discourse of it, and talk it over among
themselves, and compare notes about it, if by any means they may sift
out the meaning of it; and thus knowledge shall be increased. By
consulting this prophecy on this occasion they shall be led to search
other scriptures, which shall contribute much to their advancement in
useful knowledge; for then shall we know if we follow on to know the
Lord, [Hos 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#003.md). Those that would have
their knowledge increased must take pains, must not sit still in
slothfulness and bare wishes but run to and fro, must make use of all
the means of knowledge and improve all opportunities of getting their
mistakes rectified, their doubts resolved, and their acquaintance with
the things of God improved, to know more and to know better what they do
know. And let us here see reason to hope that, 1. Those things of God
which are now dark and obscure will hereafter be made clear, and easy to
be understood. Truth is the daughter of time. Scripture prophecies will
be expounded by the accomplishment of them; therefore they are given,
and for that explication they are reserved. Therefore they are told us
before, that, when they do come to pass, we may believe. 2. Those things
of God which are despised and neglected, and thrown by as useless, shall
be brought into reputation, shall be found to be of great service, and
be brought into request; for divine revelation, however slighted for a
time, shall be magnified and made honourable, and, above all, in the
judgment of the great day, when the books shall be opened, and that book
among the rest.

[Daniel 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">dan 12:5</span></span>

Daniel had been made to foresee the amazing revolutions of states and
kingdoms, as far as the Israel of God was concerned in them; in them he
foresaw troublous times to the church, suffering trying times, the
prospect of which much affected him and filled him with concern. Now
there were two questions proper to be asked upon this head: - When shall
the end be? And, What shall the end be? These two questions are asked
and answered here, in the close of the book; and though the comforts
prescribed in the foregoing verses, one would think, were satisfactory
enough, yet, for more abundant satisfaction, this is added.

I. The question, When shall the end be? is asked by an angel, [Dan
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#005.md), [Dan
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#006.md). Concerning this we may observe,

1\. Who it was that asked the question. Daniel had had a vision of
Christ in his glory, the man clothed in linen, [Dan
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#005.md). But his discourse had been with
the angel Gabriel, and now he looks, and behold other two ([Dan
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#005).md), two angels that he had not seen
before, one upon the bank of the river on one side and the other on the
other side, that, the river being between them, they might not whisper
to one another, but what they said might be heard. Christ stood on the
waters of the river, ([Dan 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#006).md),
between the banks of Ulai; it was therefore proper that the angels his
attendants should stand on either bank, that they might be ready to go,
one one way and the other the other way, as he should order them. These
angels appeared, (1.) To adorn the vision, and make it the more
illustrious; and to add to the glory of the Son of man, [Heb
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006.md). Daniel had not seen them before,
though it is probable that they were there; but now, when they began to
speak, he looked up, and saw them. Note, The further we look into the
things of God, and the more we converse with them, the more we shall see
of those things, and still new discoveries will be made to us; those
that know much, if they improve it, shall know more. (2.) To confirm the
discovery, that out of the mouth of two or three witnesses the word
might be established. Three angels appeared to Abraham. (3.) To inform
themselves, to hear and ask questions; for the mysteries of God's
kingdom are things which the angels desire to look into ([Pe1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012).md) and they are known to the
church, [Eph 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010.md). Now one of these
two angels said, When shall the end be? Perhaps they both asked, first
one and then the other, but Daniel heard only one.

2\. To whom this question was put, to the man clothed in linen, of whom
we read before ([Dan 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#005).md), to Christ
our great high priest, who was upon the waters of the river, and whose
spokesman, or interpreter, the angel Gabriel had all this while been.
This river was Hiddekel ([Dan 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#004).md),
the same with Tigris, the place whereabout many of the events prophesied
of would happen; there therefore is the scene laid. Hiddekel was
mentioned as one of the rivers that watered the garden of Eden ([Gen
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#014).md); fitly therefore does Christ
stand upon that river, for by him the trees in the paradise of God are
watered. Waters signify people, and so his standing upon the waters
denotes his dominion over all; he sits upon the flood ([Psa
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#010).md); he treads upon the waters of
the sea, [Job 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#008.md). And Christ, to show
that this was he, in the days of his flesh walked upon the waters, [Mat
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#025.md). He was above the waters of the
river (so some read it); he appeared in the air over the river.

3\. What the question was: How long shall it be to the end of these
wonders? Daniel would not ask the question, because he would not pry
into what was hidden, nor seem inquisitive concerning the times and the
seasons, which the Father has put in his own power, [Act
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007.md). But, that he might have the
satisfaction of the answer, the angel put the question in his hearing.
Our Lord Jesus sometimes answered the questions which his disciples were
afraid or ashamed to ask, [Joh 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#019.md).
The angel asked as one concerned, How long shall it be? What is the time
prefixed in the divine counsels for the end of these wonders, these
suffering trying times, that are to pass over the people of God? Note,
(1.) The troubles of the church are the wonder of angels. They are
astonished that God will suffer his church to be thus afflicted, and are
anxious to know what good he will do his church by its afflictions. (2.)
Good angels know no more of things to come than God is pleased to
discover to them, much less do evil angels. (3.) The holy angels in
heaven are concerned for the church on earth, and lay to heart its
afflictions; how much more then should we, who are more immediately
related to it, and have so much of our peace in its peace?

4\. What answer was returned to it by him who is indeed the numberer of
secrets, and knows things to come.

(1.) Here is a more general account given of the continuance of these
troubles to the angel that made the enquiry ([Dan
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007).md), that they shall continue for a
time, times, and a half, that is, a year, two years, and half a year, as
was before intimated ([Dan 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025).md), but
the one half of a prophetical week. Some understand it indefinitely, a
certain time for an uncertain; it shall be for a time (a considerable
time), for times (a longer time yet, double what it was thought at first
that it would be), and yet indeed it shall be but half a time, or a part
of a time; when it is over it shall seem not half so much as was feared.
But it is rather to be taken for a certain time; we meet with it in the
Revelation, under the title sometimes of three days and a half, put for
three years and a half, sometimes forty-two months, sometimes 1260 days.
Now this determination of the time is here \[1.\] Confirmed by an oath.
The man clothed in linen lifted up both his hands to heaven, and swore
by him that lives for ever and ever that it should be so. Thus the
mighty angel whom St. John saw is brought in, with a plain reference to
this vision, standing with his right foot on the sea and his left foot
on the earth, and with his hand lifted up to heaven, swearing that there
shall be no longer delay, [Rev 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#005.md),
[Rev 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#006.md). This Mighty One that Daniel
saw stood with both feet on the water, and swore with both hands lifted
up. Note, An oath is of use for confirmation; God only is to be sworn
by, for he is the proper Judge to whom we are to appeal; and lifting up
the hand is a very proper and significant sign to be used in a solemn
oath. \[2.\] It is illustrated with a reason. God will suffer him to
prevail till he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy
people. God will suffer him to do his worst, and run his utmost length,
and then all these things shall be finished. Note, God's time to succour
and relieve his people is when their affairs are brought to the last
extremity; in the mount of the Lord it shall be seen that Isaac is saved
just when he lies ready to be sacrificed. Now the event answered the
prediction; Josephus says expressly, in his book of the Wars of the
Jews, that Antiochus, surnamed Epiphanes, surprised Jerusalem by force,
and held it three years and six months, and was then cast out of the
country by the Asmoneans or Maccabees. Christ's public ministry
continued three years and a half, during which time he endured the
contradiction of sinners against himself, and lived in poverty and
disgrace; and then when his power seemed to be quite scattered at his
death, and his enemies triumphed over him, he obtained the most glorious
victory and said, It is finished.

(2.) Here is something added more particularly concerning the time of
the continuance of those troubles, in what is said to Daniel, [Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md), [Dan
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#012.md), where we have, \[1.\] The event
fixed from which the time of the trouble is to be dated, from the taking
away of the daily sacrifice by Antiochus, and the setting up of the
image of Jupiter upon the altar, which was the abomination of
desolation. They must reckon their troubles to begin indeed when they
were deprived of the benefit of public ordinances; that was to them the
beginning of sorrows; that was what they laid most to heart. \[2.\] The
continuance of their trouble; it shall last 1290 days, three years and
seven months, or (as some reckon) three years, six months, and fifteen
days; and then, it is probable, the daily sacrifice was restored, and
the abomination of desolation taken away, in remembrance of which the
feast of dedication was observed even to our Saviour's time, [Joh
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#022.md). Though it does not appear by
the history that it was exactly so long to a day, yet it appears that
the beginning of the trouble was in the 145th year of the Seleucidae,
and the end of it in the 148th year; and either the restoring of the
sacrifice, and the taking away of the image, were just so many days
after, or some other previous event that was remarkable, which is not
recorded. There are many particular times fixed in the
scripture-prophecies, which it does not appear by any history, sacred or
profane, that the event answered, and yet no doubt it did punctually; as
[Isa 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#014.md). \[3.\] The completing of
their deliverance, or at least a further advance towards it, which is
here set forty-five days after the former, and, some think, points at
the death of Antiochus, 1335 days after his profaning the temple.
Blessed is he that waits and comes to that time. It is said (1 Macc.
9:28; 10:1) that the Maccabees, under a divine conduct, recovered the
temple and the city. Many good interpreters make these to be prophetical
days (that is, so many years), and date them from the destruction of
Jerusalem by the Romans; but what events they then fall upon they are
not agreed. Others date them from the corruption of the gospel-worship
by the antichrist, whose reign is confined in the Apocalypse to 1260
days (that is, years), at the end of which he shall begin to fall; but
thirty years after he shall be quite fallen, at the end of 1290 days;
and whoever lives forty years longer, to 1335 days, will see glorious
times indeed. Whether it looks so far forward or no I cannot tell; but
this, however, we may learn, First, That there is a time fixed for the
termination of the church's troubles, and the bringing about of her
deliverance, and that this time will be punctually observed to a day.
Secondly, That this time must be waited for with faith and patience.
Thirdly, That, when it comes, it will abundantly recompense us for our
long expectations of it. Blessed is he who, having waited long, comes to
it at last, for he will then have reason to say, Lo, this is our God,
and we have waited for him.

II\. The question, What shall the end be? is asked by Daniel, and an
answer given to it. Observe,

1\. Why Daniel asked this question; it was because, though he heard what
was said to the angel, yet he did not understand it, [Dan
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#008.md). Daniel was a very intelligent
man, and had been conversant in visions and prophecies, and yet here he
was puzzled; he did not understand the meaning of the time, times, and
the part of a time, at least not so clearly and with so much certainty
as he wished. Note, The best men are often much at a loss in their
enquiries concerning divine things, and meet with that which they do not
understand. But the better they are the more sensible they are of their
own weaknesses and ignorance, and the more ready to acknowledge them.

2\. What the question was: O my Lord! What shall be the end of these
things? He directs his enquiry not to the angel that talked with him,
but immediately to Christ, for to whom else should we go with our
enquiries? "What shall be the final issue of these events? What do they
tend to? What will then end in?" Note, When we take a view of the
affairs of this world, and of the church of God in it, we cannot but
think, What will be the end of these things? We see things move as if
they would end in the utter ruin of God's kingdom among men. When we
observe the prevalence of vice and impiety, the decay of religion, the
sufferings of the righteous, and the triumphs of the ungodly over them,
we may well ask, O my Lord! what will be the end of these things? But
this may satisfy us in general, that all will end well at last. Great is
the truth, and will prevail at long-run. All opposing rule,
principality, and power, will be put down, and holiness and love will
triumph, and be in honour, to eternity. The end, this end, will come.

3\. What answer is returned to this question. Besides what refers to the
time ([Dan 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md), [Dan
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#012).md), of which before, here are some
general instructions given to Daniel, with which he is dismissed from
further attendance.

(1.) He must content himself with the discoveries that had been made to
him, and not enquire any further: "Go thy way, Daniel; let it suffice
thee that thou has been admitted thus far to the foresight of things to
come, but stop here. Go thy way about the king's business again, [Dan
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#027.md). Go thy way, and record what thou
hast seen and heard, for the benefit of posterity, and covet not to see
and hear more at present." Note, Communion with God is not our continual
feast in this world; we sometimes are taken to be witnesses of Christ's
glory, and we say, It is good to be here; but we must go down from the
mount, and have there no continuing city. Those that know much know but
in part, and still see there is a great deal that they are kept in the
dark about, and are likely to be so till the veil is rent; hitherto
their knowledge shall go, but no further. "Go thy way, Daniel, satisfied
with what thou hast."

(2.) He must not expect that what had been said to him would be fully
understood till it was accomplished: The words are closed up and sealed,
are involved in perplexities, and are likely to be so, till the time of
the end, till the end of these things; nay, till the end of all things.
Daniel was ordered to seal the book to the time of the end, [Dan
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#004.md). The Jews used to say, When Elias
comes he will tell us all things. "They are closed up and sealed, that
is, the discovery designed to be made by them is now fully settled and
completed; nothing is to be added to it nor taken from it, for it is
closed up and sealed; ask not therefore after more." Nescire velle quae
magister maximus docere non vult erudita inscitia est - He has learned
much who is willing to be ignorant of those things which the great
teacher does not choose to impart.

(3.) He must count upon no other than that, as long as the world stands,
there will still be in it such a mixture as now we see there is of good
and bad, [Dan 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#010.md). We long to see
all wheat and no tares in God's field, all corn and no chaff in God's
floor; but it will not be till the time of ingathering, till the
winnowing day, comes; both must grow together until the harvest. As it
has been, so it is, and will be, The wicked shall do wickedly, but the
wise shall understand. In this, as in other things, St. John's
Revelation closes as Daniel did. [Rev
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#011.md), He that is filthy, let him be
filthy still; and he that is holy, let him be holy still. \[1.\] There
is no remedy but that wicked people will do wickedly; and such people
there are and will be in the world to the end of time. So said the
proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceeds from the wicked ([Sa1
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#013).md); and the observation of the
moderns says the same. Bad men will do bad things; and a corrupt tree
will never bring forth good fruit. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or
bring forth good things from an evil treasure in the heart? No; wicked
practices are the natural products of wicked principles and
dispositions. Marvel not at the matter then, [Ecc
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008.md). We are told, before, that the
wicked will do wickedly; we can expect no better from them: but, which
is worse, none of the wicked shall understand. This is either, First, A
part of their sin. They will not understand; they shut their eyes
against the light, and none so blind as those that will not see.
Therefore they are wicked because they will not understand. If they did
but rightly know the truths of God, they would readily obey the laws of
God, [Psa 82:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#005.md). Wilful sin is the
effect of wilful ignorance; they will not understand because they are
wicked; they hate the light, and come not to the light, because their
deeds are evil, [Joh 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019.md). Or,
Secondly, It is a part of their punishment; they will do wickedly, and
therefore God has given them up to blindness of mind, and has said
concerning them, They shall not understand, nor be converted and healed,
[Mat 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#014.md), [Mat
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#015.md). God will not give them eyes to
see, because they will do wickedly, [Deu
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#004.md). \[2.\] Yet, bad as the world is,
God will secure to himself a remnant of good people in it; still there
shall be some, there shall be many, to whom the providences and
ordinances of God shall be a savour of life unto life, while to others
they are a savour of death unto death. First, the providences of God
shall do them good: Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried,
by their troubles (compare [Dan
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035).md), by the same troubles which
will but stir up the corruptions of the wicked and make them do more
wickedly. Note, The afflictions of good people are designed for their
trial; but by these trials they are purified and made white, their
corruptions are purged out, their graces are brightened, and made both
more vigorous and more conspicuous, and are found to praise, and honour,
and glory, [Pe1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md). To those who are
themselves sanctified and good every event is sanctified, and works for
good, and helps to make them better. Secondly, The word of God shall do
them good. When the wicked understand not, but stumble at the word, the
wise shall understand. Those who are wise in practice shall understand
doctrine; those who are influenced and governed by the divine law and
love shall be illuminated with a divine light. For if any man will do
his will he shall know the truth, [Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017.md). Give instruction to a wise man,
and he will be yet wiser.

(4.) He must comfort himself with the pleasing prospect of his own
happiness in death, in judgment, and to eternity, [Dan
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#013.md). Daniel was now very old, and
had been long engaged both in an intimate acquaintance with heaven and
in a great deal of public business on this earth. And now he must think
of bidding farewell to this present state: Go thou thy way till the end
be. \[1.\] It is good for us all to think much of going away from this
world; we are still going, and must be gone shortly, gone the way of all
the earth. That must be our way; but this is our comfort, We shall not
go till God calls for us to another world, and till he has done with us
in this world, till he says, "Go thou thy way; thou hast finished thy
testimony, done thy work, and accomplished as a hireling thy day,
therefore now, Go thy way, and leave it to others to take thy room."
\[2.\] When a good man goes his way from this world he enters into rest:
"Thou shalt rest from all thy present toils and agitations, and shalt
not see the evils that are coming on the next generation." Never can a
child of God say more pertinently than in his dying moments, Return unto
thy rest, O my soul! \[3.\] Time and days will have an end; not only our
time and days will end very shortly, but all times and days will have an
end at length; yet a little while, and time shall be no more, but all
its revolutions will be numbered and finished. \[4.\] Our rest in the
grave will be but till the end of the days; and then the peaceful rest
will be happily disturbed by a joyful resurrection. Job foresaw this
when he said of the dead, Till the heavens be no more, they shall not
awake, nor be raised out of their sleep, implying that then they shall,
[Job 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#012.md). \[5.\] We must every one
of us stand in our lot at the end of the days. In the judgment of the
great day we must have our allotment according to what we were, and what
we did, in the body, either, Come, you blessed or, Go, you cursed; and
we must stand for ever in that lot. It was a comfort to Daniel, it is a
comfort to all the saints, that, whatever their lot is in the days of
time, they shall have a happy lot in the end of the days, shall have
their lot among the chosen. And it ought to be the great care and
concern of every one of us to secure a happy lot at last in the end of
the days, and they we may well be content with our present lot, welcome
the will of God. \[6.\] A believing hope and prospect of a blessed lot
in the heavenly Canaan, at the end of the days, will be an effectual
support to us when we are going our way out of this world, and will
furnish us with living comforts in dying moments.
