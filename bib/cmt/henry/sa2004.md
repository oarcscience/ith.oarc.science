### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 4:0</span></span>

When Abner was slain David was at a loss for a friend to perfect the
reduction of those tribes that were yet in Ish-bosheth's interest. Which
way to adopt for the accomplishment of it he could not tell; but here
Providence brings it about by the removal of Ish-bosheth. I. Two of his
own servants slew him, and brought his head to David ([Sa2
4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#001).md). II. David, instead of
rewarding them, put them to death for what they had done ([Sa2
4:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#009).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 4:1</span></span>

Here is, I. The weakness of Saul's house. Still it grew weaker and
weaker. 1. As for Ishbosheth, who was in possession of the throne, his
hands were feeble, [Sa2 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#001.md). All the
strength they ever had was from Abner's support, and now that he was
dead he had no spirit left in him. Though Abner had, in a passion,
deserted his interest, yet he hoped, by his means, to make good terms
with David; but now even this hope fails him, and he sees himself
forsaken by his friends and at the mercy of his enemies. All the
Israelites that adhered to him were troubled and at a loss what to do,
whether to proceed in their treaty with David or no. 2. As for
Mephibosheth, who in the right of his father Jonathan had a prior title,
his feet were lame, and he was unfit for any service, [Sa2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#004.md). He was but five years old when
his father and grandfather were killed. His nurse, hearing of the
Philistines' victory, was apprehensive that, in pursuit of it, they
would immediately send a party to Saul's house, to cut off all that
pertained to it, and would especially aim at her young master, who was
now next heir to the crown. Under the apprehension of this, she fled
with the child in her arms, to secure it either in some secret place
where he could not be found, or in some strong place where he could not
be got at; and, making more haste than good speed, she fell with the
child, and by the fall some bone was broken or put out, and not well
set, so that he was lame of it as long as he lived, and unfit either for
court or camp. See what sad accidents children are liable to in their
infancy, the effect of which may be felt by them, to their great
uneasiness, all their days. Even the children of princes and great men,
the children of good men, for such a one Jonathan was, children that are
well tended, and have nurses of their own to take care of them, yet are
not always safe. What reason have we to be thankful to God for the
preservation of our limbs and senses to us, through the many perils of
the weak and helpless state of infancy, and to own his goodness in
giving his angels a charge concerning us, to bear us up in their arms,
out of which there is no danger of falling, [Psa
91:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#012.md).

II\. The murder of Saul's son. We are here told,

1\. Who were the murderers: Baanah and Rechab, [Sa2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#002.md), [Sa2
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#003.md). They were own brothers, as Simeon
and Levi, and partners in iniquity. They were or had been Ish-bosheth's
own servants, employed under him, so much the more base and treacherous
was it in them to do him a mischief. They were Benjamites, of his own
tribe. They were of the city of Beeroth; for some reason which we cannot
now account for care is here taken to let us know (in a parenthesis)
that that city belonged to the lot of Benjamin, so we find ([Jos
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#025).md), but that the inhabitants, upon
some occasion or other, perhaps upon the death of Saul, retired to
Gittaim, another city which lay not far off in the same tribe, and was
better fortified by nature, being situate (if we may depend upon Mr.
Fuller's map) between the two rocks Bozez and Seneh. There the
Beerothites were when this was written, and probably took root there,
and never returned to Beeroth again, which made Beeroth, that had been
one of the cities of the Gibeonites ([Jos
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#017).md), to be forgotten, and Gittaim to
be famous long after, as we find, [Neh
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#033.md).

2\. How the murder was committed, [Sa2
4:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#005). See here, (1..md) The slothfulness
of Ish-bosheth. He lay upon his bed at noon. It does not appear that the
country was at any time of the year so hot as to oblige the inhabitants
to retire at noon, as we are told they do in Spain in the heat of
summer; but Ishbosheth was a sluggish man, loved his ease and hated
business: and when he should have been, at this critical juncture, at
the head of his forces in the field, or at the head of his counsels in a
treaty with David, he was lying upon his bed and sleeping, for his hands
were feeble ([Sa2 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#001).md), and so were
his head and heart. When those difficulties dispirit us which should
rather invigorate us and sharpen our endeavours we betray both our
crowns and lives. Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty and ruin.
The idle soul is an easy prey to the destroyer. (2.) The treachery of
Baanah and Rechab. They came into the house, under pretence of fetching
wheat for the victualling of their regiments; and such was the plainness
of those times that the king's corn-chamber and his bed-chamber lay near
together, which gave them an opportunity, when they were fetching wheat,
to murder him as he lay on the bed. We know not when and where death
will meet us. When we lie down to sleep we are not sure but that we may
sleep the sleep of death before we awake; nor do we know from what
unsuspected hand a fatal stroke may come. Ish-bosheth's own men, who
should have protected his life, took it away.

3\. The murderers triumphed in what they had done. As if they had
performed some very glorious action, and the doing of it for David's
advantage was enough not only to justify it, but to sanctify it, they
made a present of Ish-bosheth's head to David ([Sa2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#008).md): Behold the head of thy enemy,
than which they thought nothing could be more acceptable to him; yea,
and they made themselves instruments of God's justice, ministers to bear
his sword, though they had no commission: The Lord hath avenged thee
this day of Saul and of his seed. Not that they had any regard either to
God or to David's honour; they aimed at nothing but to make their own
fortunes (as we say) and to get preferment in David's court; but, to
ingratiate themselves with him, they pretended a concern for his life, a
conviction of his title, and a zealous desire to see him in full
possession of the throne. Jehu pretended zeal for the Lord of hosts when
an ambition to set up himself and his own family was the spring of his
actions.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 4:9</span></span>

We have here justice done upon the murderers of Ish-bosheth.

I. Sentence passed upon them. There needed no evidence, their own
tongues witnessed against them; they were so far from denying the fact
that they gloried in it. David therefore shows them the heinousness of
the crime, and that blood called for blood from his hand, who was now
the chief magistrate, and was by office the avenger of blood. And,
perhaps, he was the more vigorous in the prosecution because for reasons
of state he had spared Joab: "Shall I not require the blood of the slain
at the hand of the slayers, and, since they cannot make restitution,
take theirs instead of it?" Observe, 1. How he aggravates the crime,
[Sa2 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#011.md). Ish-bosheth was a righteous
person, he had done them no wrong, nor designed them any. As to himself,
David was satisfied that what opposition he gave him was not from
malice, but mistake, from an idea he had of his own title to the crown,
and the influence of others upon him, who urged him to put in for it.
Note, Charity teaches us to make the best, not only of our friends, but
of our enemies, and to think those may be righteous persons who yet, in
some instances, do us wrong. I must not presently judge a man a bad man
because I think him so to me. David owns Ish-bosheth an honest man,
though he had created him a great deal of trouble unjustly. The manner
of it much aggravated the crime. To slay him in his own house, which
should have been his castle, and upon his bed, when he was in no
capacity of making any opposition, this is treacherous and barbarous,
and all that is base, and that which the heart of every man who is not
perfectly lost to all honour and humanity will rise with indignation at
the thought of. Assassinating is confessedly the most odious and
villainous way of murdering. Cursed is he that smiteth his neighbour
secretly. 2. He quotes a precedent ([Sa2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#010).md): he had put him to death who had
brought him the tidings of the death of Saul, because he thought it
would be good tidings to David. Nothing is here said of that Amalekite's
helping Saul to kill himself, only of his bringing the tidings of his
death, by which it should seem that the story he told was upon enquiry
found to be false, and that he lied against his own head. "Now" (says
David) "did I treat him as a criminal, and not a favourite" (as he
expected), "who brought me Saul's crown, and shall those be held
guiltless that bring me Ish-bosheth's head?" 3. He ratifies the sentence
with an oath ([Sa2 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#009).md): As the Lord
liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity. He expresses
himself thus resolutely, to prevent the making of any intercession for
the criminals by those about him, and thus piously to intimate that his
dependence was upon God for the putting of him in possession of the
promised throne, and that he would not be beholden to any man to help
him to it by any indirect or unlawful practices. God had redeemed him
from all adversity hitherto, helped him over many a difficulty and
through many a danger, and therefore he would depend upon him to crown
and complete his own work. He speaks of his redemption from all
adversity as a thing done, though he had many a storm yet before him,
because he knew that he who had delivered would deliver. 4. Hereupon he
signs a warrant for the execution of these men, [Sa2
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#012.md). This may seem severe, when they
intended him a kindness in what they did; but, (1.) He would thus show
his detestation of the villany. When he heard that the Lord smote Nabal,
he gave thanks ([Sa1 25:38](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#038.md), [Sa1
25:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#039).md), for he is the God to whom
vengeance belongeth; but, if wicked men smite Ish-bosheth, they deserve
to die for taking God's work out of his hand. (2.) He would thus show
his resentment of the great affront they put upon him in expecting that
he should patronize and reward it; they could scarcely have done him a
greater injury than thus to think him altogether such a one as
themselves, one that cared not what blood he waded through to the crown.

II\. Execution done. The murderers were put to death according to law,
and their hands and feet were hung up; not their whole bodies, the law
forbade that; but only their hands and feet, in terrorem - to frighten
others, to be monuments of David's justice, and to make that to be taken
notice of which would recommend him to the esteem of the people, as a
man fit to rule, and that aimed not at his own preferment, nor had any
enmity to the house of Saul, but only and sincerely designed the public
welfare. But what a confusion was this to the two murderers! What a
horrid disappointment! And such those will meet with who think to serve
the interests of the Son of David by any immoral practices, by war and
persecution, fraud and rapine, who, under colour of religion, murder
princes, break solemn contracts, lay countries waste, hate their
brethren, and cast them out, and say, Let the Lord be glorified, kill
them, and think they do God good service. However men may canonize such
methods of serving the church and the catholic cause, Christ will let
them know, another day, that Christianity was not intended to destroy
humanity; and those who thus think to merit heaven shall not escape the
damnation of hell.
