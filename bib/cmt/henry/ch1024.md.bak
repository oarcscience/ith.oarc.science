### [1 Chronicles Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 24:0</span></span>

This chapter gives us a more particular account of the distribution of
the priests and Levites into their respective classes, for the more
regular discharge of the duties of their offices, according to their
families. I. Of the priests (v. 1-19). II. Of the Levites ([Ch1
24:20-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#020).md).

[1 Chronicles 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 24:1</span></span>

The particular account of these establishments is of little use to us
now; but, when Ezra published it, it was of great use to direct their
church affairs after their return from captivity into the old channel
again. The title of this record we have v. 1 - These are the divisions
of the sons of Aaron, not by which they divided one from another, or
were at variance one with another (it is a pity there should ever be any
such divisions among the sons of Israel, but especially among the sons
of Aaron), but the distribution of them in order to the dividing of
their work among themselves; it was a division which God made, and was
made for him. 1. This distribution was made for the more regular
discharge of the duties of their office. God was, and still is, the God
of order, and not of confusion, particularly in the things of his
worship. Number without order is but a clog and an occasion of tumult;
but when every one has, and knows, and keeps, his place and work, the
more the better. In the mystical body, every member has its use, for the
good of the whole, [Rom 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#004.md), [Rom
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#005.md); [Co1
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012.md). 2. It was made by lot, that the
disposal thereof might be of the Lord, and so all quarrels and
contentions might be prevented, and no man could be charged with
partiality, nor could any say that they had wrong done them. As God is
the God or order, so he is the God of peace. Solomon says of the lot
that it causeth contention to cease. 3. The lot was cast publicly, and
with great solemnity, in the presence of the king, princes, and priests,
that there might be no room for any fraudulent practices or the
suspicion of them. The lot is an appeal to God, and ought to be managed
with corresponding reverence and sincerity. Matthias was chosen to the
apostleship by lot, with prayer ([Act
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#024.md), [Act
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#026).md), and I know not but it might be
still used in faith in parallel cases, as an instituted ordinance. We
have here the name of the public notary that was employed in writing the
names, and drawing the lots, ([Ch1
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#006).md): Shemaiah, one of the Levites.
4. What those priests were chosen to was to preside in the affairs of
the sanctuary ([Ch1 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#005).md), in their
several courses and turns. That which was to be determined by the lot
was only the precedency, not who should serve (for they chose all the
chief men), but who should serve first, and who next, that every one
might know his course, and attend in it. Of the twenty-four chief men of
the priests sixteen were of the house of Eleazar and eight of Ithamar;
for the house of Ithamar may well be supposed to have dwindled since the
sentence passed on the family of Eli, who was of that house. The method
of drawing the lots is intimated ([Ch1
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#006).md), one chief household being taken
for Eleazar, and one for Ithamar. The sixteen chief names of Eleazar
were put in one urn, the eight for Ithamar in another, and they drew out
of them alternately, as long as those for Ithamar lasted, and then out
of those only for Eleazar, or two for Eleazar, and then one for Ithamar,
throughout. 5. Among these twenty-four courses the eighth is that of
Abijah or Abia ([Ch1 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#010).md), which is
mentioned ([Luk 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#005).md) as the course
which Zechariah was of, the father of John the Baptist, by which it
appears that these courses which David now settled, though interrupted
perhaps in the bad reigns and long broken off by the captivity, yet
continued in succession till the destruction of the second temple by the
Romans. And each course was called by the name of him in whom it was
first founded, as the high priest is here called Aaron ([Ch1
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#019).md), because succeeding in his
dignity and power, though we read not of any of them that bore that
name. Whoever was high priest must be reverenced and observed by the
inferior priests as their father, as Aaron their father. Christ is high
priest over the house of God, to whom all believers, being made priests,
are to be in subjection.

[1 Chronicles 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 24:20</span></span>

Most of the Levites here named were mentioned before, [Ch1
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#016.md), etc. They were of those who
were to attend the priests in the service of the house of God. But they
are here mentioned again as heads of the twenty-four courses of Levites
(and about so many are here named), who were to attend the twenty-four
courses of the priests: they are therefore said to cast lots over
against their brethren (so they are called, not their lords), the sons
of Aaron, who were not to lord it over God's clergy, as the original
word is, [Pe1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#003.md). And, that the whole
disposal of the affair might be of the Lord, the principal fathers cast
lots over against their younger brethren; that is, those that were of
the elder house came upon he level with those of the younger families,
and took their place, not by seniority, but as God by the lot directed.
Note, In Christ no difference is made between bond and free, elder and
younger. The younger brethren, if they be faithful and sincere, shall be
no less acceptable to Christ than the principal fathers.
