### [2 Corinthians Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">co2 12:0</span></span>

In this chapter the apostle proceeds in maintaining the honour of his
apostleship. He magnified his office when there were those who vilified
it. What he says in his own praise was only in his own justification and
the necessary defence of the honour of his ministry, the preservation of
which was necessary to its success. First, He makes mention of the
favour God had shown him, the honour done him, the methods God took to
keep him humble, and the use he made of this dispensation ([Co2
12:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001).md). Then he addresses himself to
the Corinthians, blaming them for what was faulty among them, and giving
a large account of his behaviour and kind intentions towards them ([Co2
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#011) to the end.md).

[2 Corinthians 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 12:1</span></span>

Here we may observe,

I. The narrative the apostle gives of the favours God had shown him, and
the honour he had done him; for doubtless he himself is the man in
Christ of whom he speaks. Concerning this we may take notice, 1. Of the
honour itself which was done to the apostle: he was caught up into the
third heaven, [Co2 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#002.md). When this was
we cannot say, whether it was during those three days that he lay
without sight at his conversion or at some other time afterwards, much
less can we pretend to say how this was, whether by a separation of his
soul from his body or by an extraordinary transport in the depth of
contemplation. It would be presumption for us to determine, if not also
to enquire into, this matter, seeing the apostle himself says, Whether
in the body or out of the body, I cannot tell. It was certainly a very
extraordinary honour done him: in some sense he was caught up into the
third heaven, the heaven of the blessed, above the aerial heaven, in
which the fowls fly, above the starry heaven, which is adorned with
those glorious orbs: it was into the third heaven, where God most
eminently manifests his glory. We are not capable of knowing all, nor is
it fit we should know very much, of the particulars of that glorious
place and state; it is our duty and interest to give diligence to make
sure to ourselves a mansion there; and, if that be cleared up to us,
then we should long to be removed thither, to abide there for ever. This
third heaven is called paradise ([Co2
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#004).md), in allusion to the earthly
paradise out of which Adam was driven for his transgression; it is
called the paradise of God ([Rev 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007).md),
signifying to us that by Christ we are restored to all the joys and
honours we lost by sin, yea, to much better. The apostle does not
mention what he saw in the third heaven or paradise, but tells us that
he heard unspeakable words, such as it is not possible for a man to
utter - such are the sublimity of the matter and our unacquaintedness
with the language of the upper world: nor was it lawful to utter those
words, because, while we are here in this world, we have a more sure
word of prophecy than such visions and revelations. [Pe2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019.md). We read of the tongue of angels
as well as men, and Paul knew as much of that as ever any man upon earth
did, and yet preferred charity, that is, the sincere love of God and our
neighbour. This account which the apostle gives us of his vision should
check our curious desires after forbidden knowledge, and teach us to
improve the revelation God has given us in his word. Paul himself, who
had been in the third heaven, did not publish to the world what he had
heard there, but adhered to the doctrine of Christ: on this foundation
the church is built, and on this we must build our faith and hope. 2.
The modest and humble manner in which the apostle mentions this matter
is observable. One would be apt to think that one who had had such
visions and revelations as these would have boasted greatly of them;
but, says he, It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory, [Co2
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001.md). He therefore did not mention
this immediately, nor till above fourteen years after, [Co2
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#002.md). And then it is not without some
reluctancy, as a thing which in a manner he was forced to by the
necessity of the case. Again, he speaks of himself in the third person,
and does not say, I am the man who was thus honoured above other men.
Again, his humility appears by the check he seems to put upon himself
([Co2 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#006).md), which plainly shows that
he delighted not to dwell upon this theme. Thus was he, who was not
behind the chief of the apostles in dignity, very eminent for his
humility. Note, It is an excellent thing to have a lowly spirit in the
midst of high advancements; and those who abase themselves shall be
exalted.

II\. The apostle gives an account of the methods God took to keep him
humble, and to prevent his being lifted up above measure; and this he
speaks of to balance the account that was given before of the visions
and revelations he had had. Note, When God's people communicate their
experiences, let them always remember to take notice of what God has
done to keep them humble, as well as what he has done in favour to them
and for their advancement. Here observe,

1\. The apostle was pained with a thorn in the flesh, and buffeted with
a messenger of Satan, [Co2 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007.md). We
are much in the dark what this was, whether some great trouble or some
great temptation. Some think it was an acute bodily pain or sickness;
others think it was the indignities done him by the false apostles, and
the opposition he met with from them, particularly on the account of his
speech, which was contemptible. However this was, God often brings this
good out of evil, that the reproaches of our enemies help to hide pride
from us; and this is certain, that what the apostle calls a thorn in his
flesh was for a time very grievous to him: but the thorns Christ wore
for us, and with which he was crowned, sanctify and make easy all the
thorns in the flesh we may at any time be afflicted with; for he
suffered, being tempted, that he might be able to succour those that are
tempted. Temptations to sin are most grievous thorns; they are
messengers of Satan, to buffet us. Indeed it is a great grievance to a
good man to be so much as tempted to sin.

2\. The design of this was to keep the apostle humble: Lest he should be
exalted above measure, [Co2 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007.md). Paul
himself knew he had not yet attained, neither was already perfect; and
yet he was in danger of being lifted up with pride. If God love us, he
will hide pride from us, and keep us from being exalted above measure;
and spiritual burdens are ordered, to cure spiritual pride. This thorn
in the flesh is said to be a messenger of Satan, which he did not send
with a good design, but on the contrary, with ill intentions, to
discourage the apostle (who had been so highly favoured of God) and
hinder him in his work. But God designed this for good, and he overruled
it for good, and made this messenger of Satan to be so far from being a
hindrance that it was a help to the apostle.

3\. The apostle prayed earnestly to God for the removal of this sore
grievance. Note, Prayer is a salve for every sore, a remedy for every
malady; and when we are afflicted with thorns in the flesh we should
give ourselves to prayer. Therefore we are sometimes tempted that we may
learn to pray. The apostle besought the Lord thrice, that it might
depart from him, [Co2 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#008.md). Note,
Though afflictions are sent for our spiritual benefit, yet we may pray
to God for the removal of them: we ought indeed to desire also that they
may reach the end for which they are designed. The apostle prayed
earnestly, and repeated his requests; he besought the Lord thrice, that
is, often. So that if an answer be not given to the first prayer, nor to
the second, we must hold on, and hold out, till we receive an answer.
Christ himself prayed to his Father thrice. As troubles are sent to
teach us to pray, so they are continued to teach us to continue instant
in prayer.

4\. We have an account of the answer given to the apostle's prayer,
that, although the trouble was not removed, yet an equivalent should be
granted: My grace is sufficient for thee. Note, (1.) Though God accepts
the prayer of faith, yet he does not always answer it in the letter; as
he sometimes grants in wrath, so he sometimes denies in love. (2.) When
God does not remove our troubles and temptations, yet, if he gives us
grace sufficient for us, we have no reason to complain, nor to say that
he deals ill by us. It is a great comfort to us, whatever thorns in the
flesh we are pained with, that God's grace is sufficient for us. Grace
signifies two things: - \[1.\] The good-will of God towards us, and this
is enough to enlighten and enliven us, sufficient to strengthen and
comfort us, to support our souls and cheer up our spirits, in all
afflictions and distresses. \[2.\] The good work of God in us, the grace
we receive from the fulness that is in Christ our head; and from him
there shall be communicated that which is suitable and seasonable, and
sufficient for his members. Christ Jesus understands our case, and knows
our need, and will proportion the remedy to our malady, and not only
strengthen us, but glorify himself. His strength is made perfect in our
weakness. Thus his grace is manifested and magnified; he ordains his
praise out of the mouths of babes and sucklings.

III\. Here is the use which the apostle makes of this dispensation: He
gloried in his infirmities ([Co2
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009).md), and took pleasure in them, [Co2
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#010.md). He does not mean his sinful
infirmities (those we have reason to be ashamed of and grieved at), but
he means his afflictions, his reproaches, necessities, persecutions, and
distresses for Christ's sake, [Co2
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#010.md). And the reason of his glory and
joy on account of these things was this - they were fair opportunities
for Christ to manifest the power and sufficiency of his grace resting
upon him, by which he had so much experience of the strength of divine
grace that he could say, When I am weak, then am I strong. This is a
Christian paradox: when we are weak in ourselves, then we are strong in
the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ; when we see ourselves weak in
ourselves, then we go out of ourselves to Christ, and are qualified to
receive strength from him, and experience most of the supplies of divine
strength and grace.

[2 Corinthians 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 12:11</span></span>

In these verses the apostle addresses himself to the Corinthians two
ways: -

I. He blames them for what was faulty in them; namely, that they had not
stood up in his defence as they ought to have done, and so made it the
more needful for him to insist so much on his own vindication. They in
manner compelled him to commend himself, who ought to have been
commended of them [Co2 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#011.md). And had
they, or some among them, not failed on their part, it would have been
less needful for him to have said so much on his own behalf. He tells
them further that they in particular had good reason to speak well of
him, as being in nothing behind the very chief apostles, because he had
given them full proof and evidence of his apostleship; for the signs of
an apostle were wrought among them in all patience, in signs, and
wonders, and mighty deeds. Note, 1. It is a debt we owe to good men to
stand up in the defence of their reputation; and we are under special
obligations to those we have received benefit by, especially spiritual
benefit, to own them as instruments in God's hand of good to us, and to
vindicate them when they are calumniated by others. 2. How much soever
we are, or ought to be, esteemed by others, we ought always to think
humbly of ourselves. See an example of this in this great apostle, who
thought himself to be nothing, though in truth he was not behind the
greatest apostles - so far was he from seeking praise from men, though
he tells them their duty to vindicate his reputation - so far was he
from applauding himself, when he was forced to insist upon his own
necessary self-defence.

II\. He gives a large account of his behaviour and kind intentions
towards them, in which we may observe the character of a faithful
minister of the gospel. 1. He was not willing to be burdensome to them,
nor did he seek theirs, but them. He says ([Co2
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#013).md) he had not been burdensome to
them, for the time past, and tells them ([Co2
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#014).md) he would not be burdensome to
them for the time to come, when he should come to them. He spared their
purses, and did not covet their money: I seek not yours but you. He
sought not to enrich himself, but to save their souls: he did not desire
to make a property of them to himself, but to gain them over to Christ,
whose servant he was. Note, Those who aim at clothing themselves with
the fleece of the flock, and take no care of the sheep, are hirelings,
and not good shepherds. 2. He would gladly spend and be spent for them
([Co2 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#015).md); that is, he was willing
to take pains and to suffer loss for their good. He would spend his
time, his parts, his strength, his interest, his all, to do them
service; nay, so spend as to be spent, and be like a candle, which
consumes itself to give light to others. 3. He did not abate in his love
to them, notwithstanding their unkindness and ingratitude to him; and
therefore was contented and glad to take pains with them, though the
more abundantly he loved them the less he was loved, [Co2
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#015.md). This is applicable to other
relations: if others be wanting in their duty to us it does not follow
therefore that we may neglect our duty to them. 4. He was careful not
only that he himself should not be burdensome, but that none he employed
should. This seems to be the meaning of what we read, [Co2
12:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#016.md). If it should be objected by
any that though he did not himself burden them, yet, being crafty, he
caught them with guile, that is, he sent those among them who pillaged
them, and afterwards he shared with them in the profit: "This was not
so," says the apostle; "I did not make a gain of you myself, nor by any
of those whom I sent; nor did Titus, nor any others - We walked by the
same spirit and in the same steps." They all agreed in this matter to do
them all the good they could, without being burdensome to them, to
promote the gospel among them and make it as easy to them as possible.
Or, this may be read with an interrogation, as utterly disclaiming any
guile in himself and others towards them. 5. He was a man who did all
things for edifying, [Co2 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#019.md). This
was his great aim and design, to do good, to lay the foundation well,
and then with care and diligence to build the superstructure. 6. He
would not shrink from his duty for fear of displeasing them, though he
was so careful to make himself easy to them. Therefore he was resolved
to be faithful in reproving sin, though he was therein found to be such
as they would not, [Co2 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#020.md). The
apostle here mentions several sins that are too commonly found among
professors of religion, and are very reprovable: debates, envyings,
wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults; and,
though those who are guilty of these sins can hardly bear to be reproved
for them, yet faithful ministers must not fear offending the guilty by
sharp reproofs, as they are needful, in public and in private. 7. He was
grieved at the apprehension that he should find scandalous sins among
them not duly repented of. This, he tells them, would be the cause of
great humiliation and lamentation. Note, (1.) The falls and miscarriages
of professors cannot but be a humbling consideration to a good minister;
and God sometimes takes this way to humble those who might be under
temptation to be lifted up: I fear lest my God will humble me among you.
(2.) We have reason to bewail those who sin and do not repent, to bewail
many that have sinned, and have not repented, [Co2
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#021.md). If these have not, as yet,
grace to mourn and lament their own case, their case is the more
lamentable; and those who love God, and love them, should mourn for
them.
