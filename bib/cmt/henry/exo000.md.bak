An Exposition, with Practical Observations, of The Second Book of Moses,
Called Exodus

Moses (the servant of the Lord in writing for him as well as in acting
for him - with the pen of God as well as with the rod of God in his
hand) having, in the first book of his history, preserved and
transmitted the records of the church, while it existed in private
families, comes, in this second book, to give us an account of its
growth into a great nation; and, as the former furnishes us with the
best economics, so this with the best politics. The beginning of the
former book shows us how God formed the world for himself; the beginning
of this shows us how he formed Israel for himself, and both show forth
his praise, [Isa 43:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#021.md). There we have
the creation of the world in history, here the redemption of the world
in type. The Greek translators called this book Exodus (which signifies
a departure or going out) because it begins with the story of the going
out of the children of Israel from Egypt. Some allude to the names of
this and the foregoing book, and observe that immediately after Genesis,
which signifies the beginning or original, follows Exodus, which
signifies a departure; for a time to be born is immediately succeeded by
a time to die. No sooner have we made our entrance into the world than
we must think of making our exit, and going out of the world. When we
begin to live we begin to die. The forming of Israel into a people was a
new creation. As the earth was, in the beginning, first fetched from
under water, and then beautified and replenished, so Israel was first by
an almighty power made to emerge out of Egyptian slavery, and then
enriched with God's law and tabernacle. This book gives us, I. The
accomplishment of the promises made before to Abraham (ch. 1-19), and
then, II. The establishment of the ordinances which were afterwards
observed by Israel (ch. 20-40). Moses, in this book, begins, like
Caesar, to write his own Commentaries; nay, a greater, a far greater,
than Caesar is here. But henceforward the penman is himself the hero,
and gives us the history of those things of which he was himself an eye
and ear-witness, et quorum pars magna fuit - and in which he bore a
conspicuous part. There are more types of Christ in this book than
perhaps in any other book of the Old Testament; for Moses wrote of him,
[Joh 5:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#046.md). The way of man's
reconciliation to God, and coming into covenant and communion with him
by a Mediator, is here variously represented; and it is of great use to
us for the illustration of the New Testament, now that we have that to
assist us in the explication of the Old.
