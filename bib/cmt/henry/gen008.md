### [Genesis Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 8:0</span></span>

In the close of the foregoing chapter we left the world in ruins and the
church in straits; but in this chapter we have the repair of the one and
the enlargement of the other. Now the scene alters, and another face of
things begins to be presented to us, and the brighter side of that cloud
which there appeared so black and dark; for, though God contend long, he
will not contend for ever, nor be always wrath. We have here, I. The
earth made anew, by the recess of the waters, and the appearing of the
dry land, now a second time, and both gradual. 1. The increase of the
waters is stayed ([Gen 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#001.md), [Gen
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#002).md). 2. They begin sensibly to abate
([Gen 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#003).md). 3. After sixteen days'
ebbing, the ark rests ([Gen 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#004).md). 4.
After sixty days' ebbing, the tops of the mountains appeared above water
([Gen 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#005).md). 5. After forty days'
ebbing, and twenty days before the mountains appeared, Noah began to
send out his spies, a raven and a dove, to gain intelligence ([Gen
8:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#006).md). 6. Two months after the
appearing of the tops of the mountains, the waters had gone, and the
face of the earth was dry ([Gen 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#013).md),
though not dried so as to be fit for man till almost two months after
([Gen 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#014).md). II. Man placed anew upon
the earth, in which, 1. Noah's discharge and departure out of the ark
([Gen 8:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#015).md). 2. His sacrifice of
praise, which he offered to God upon his enlargement ([Gen
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#020).md). 3. God's acceptance of his
sacrifice, and the promise he made thereupon not to drown the world
again ([Gen 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021.md), [Gen
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#022).md). And thus, at length, mercy
rejoices against judgment.

[Genesis 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 8:1</span></span>

Here is, I. An act of God's grace: God remembered Noah and every living
thing. This is an expression after the manner of men; for not any of his
creatures ([Luk 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#006).md), much less any
of his people, are forgotten of God, [Isa
49:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#015.md), [Isa
49:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#016.md). but, 1. The whole race of
mankind, except Noah and his family, was now extinguished, and driven
into the land of forgetfulness, to be remembered no more; so that God's
remembering Noah was the return of his mercy to mankind, of whom he
would not make a full end. It is a strange expression, [Eze
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#013.md), When I have accomplished my fury
in them, I will be comforted. The demands of divine justice had been
answered by the ruin of those sinners; he had eased him of his
adversaries ([Isa 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024).md), and now his
spirit was quieted ([Zac 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#008).md), and he
remembered Noah and every living thing. he remembered mercy in wrath
([Hab 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#002).md), remembered the days of old
([Isa 63:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#011).md), remembered the holy
seed, and then remembered Noah. 2. Noah himself, though one that had
found grace in the eyes of the Lord, yet seemed to be forgotten in the
ark, and perhaps began to think himself so; for we do not find that God
had told him how long he should be confined and when he should be
released. Very good men have sometimes been ready to conclude themselves
forgotten of God, especially when their afflictions have been unusually
grievous and long. Perhaps Noah, though a great believer, yet when he
found the flood continuing so long after it might reasonably be presumed
to have done its work, was tempted to fear lest he that shut him in
would keep him in, and began to expostulate. How long wilt thou forget
me? But at length God returned in mercy to him, and this is expressed by
remembering him. Note, Those that remember God shall certainly be
remembered by him, how desolate and disconsolate soever their condition
may be. He will appoint them a set time and remember them, [Job
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#013.md). 3. With Noah, God remembered
every living thing; for, though his delight is especially in the sons of
men, yet he rejoices in all his works, and hates nothing that he has
made. He takes special care, not only of his people's persons, but of
their possessions - of them and all that belongs to them. He considered
the cattle of Nineveh, [Jon 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#011.md).

II\. An act of God's power over wind and water, both of which are at his
beck, though neither of them is under man's control. Observe,

1\. He commanded the wind, and said to that, Go, and it went, in order
to the carrying off of the flood: God made a wind to pass over the
earth. See here, (1.) What was God's remembrance of Noah: it was his
relieving him. Note, Those whom God remembers he remembers effectually,
for good; he remembers us to save us, that we may remember him to serve
him. (2.) What a sovereign dominion God has over the winds. He has them
in his fist ([Pro 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#004).md) and brings
them out of his treasuries, [Psa
135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007.md). He sends them when, and
whither, and for what purposes, he pleases. Even stormy winds fulfil his
word, [Psa 148:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#008.md). It should seem,
while the waters increased, there was no wind; for that would have added
to the toss of the ark; but now God sent a wind, when it would not be so
troublesome. Probably, it was a north wind, for that drives away rain.
However, it was a drying wind, such a wind as God sent to divide the Red
Sea before Israel, [Exo 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021.md).

2\. He remanded the waters, and said to them, Come, and they came. (1.)
He took away the cause. He sealed up the springs of those waters, the
fountains of the great deep, and the windows of heaven. Note, \[1.\] As
God has a key to open, so he has a key to shut up again, and to stay the
progress of judgments by stopping the causes of them: and the same hand
that brings the desolation must bring the deliverance; to that hand
therefore our eye must ever be. He that wounds is alone able to heal.
See [Job 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#014.md), [Job
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#015.md). \[2.\] When afflictions have
done the work for which they are sent, whether killing work or curing
work, they shall be removed. God's word shall not return void, [Isa
55:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#010.md), [Isa
55:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#011). (2..md) Then the effect ceased;
not all at once, but by degrees: The waters abated ([Gen
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#001).md), returned from off the earth
continually, Heb. they were going and returning (v. 3), which denotes a
gradual departure. The heat of the sun exhaled much, and perhaps the
subterraneous caverns soaked in more. Note, As the earth was not drowned
in a day, so it was not dried in a day. In the creation, it was but one
day's work to clear the earth from the waters that covered it, and to
make it dry land; nay, it was but half a day's work, [Gen
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#009.md), [Gen
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#010.md). But, the work of creation being
finished, this work of providence was effected by the concurring
influence of second causes, yet thus enforced by the almighty power of
God. God usually works deliverance for his people gradually, that the
day of small things may not be despised, nor the day of great things
despaired of, [Zac 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010.md). See [Pro
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018.md).

[Genesis 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 8:4</span></span>

Here we have the effects and evidences of the ebbing of the waters. 1.
The ark rested. This was some satisfaction to Noah, to feel the house he
was in upon firm ground, and no longer movable. It rested upon a
mountain, whither it was directed, not by Noah's prudence (he did not
steer it), but by the wise and gracious providence of God, that it might
rest the sooner. Note, God has times and places of rest for his people
after their tossings; and many a time he provides for their seasonable
and comfortable settlement without their own contrivance and quite
beyond their own foresight. The ark of the church, though sometimes
tossed with tempests, and not comforted ([Isa
54:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#011).md), yet has its rests, [Act
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031.md). 2. The tops of the mountains
were seen, like little islands, appearing above the water. We must
suppose that they were seen by Noah and his sons; for there were none
besides to see them. It is probable that they had looked through the
window of the ark every day, like the longing mariners, after a tedious
voyage, to see if they could discover land, or as the prophet's servant
([Kg1 18:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#043.md), [Kg1
18:44](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#044).md), and at length they spy ground,
and enter the day of the discovery in their journal. They felt ground
above forty days before they saw it, according to Dr. Lightfoot's
computation, whence he infers that, if the waters decreased
proportionably, the ark drew eleven cubits in water.

[Genesis 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 8:6</span></span>

We have here an account of the spies which Noah sent forth to bring him
intelligence from abroad, a raven and a dove. Observe here,

I. That though God had told Noah particularly when the flood would come,
even to a day ([Gen 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#004).md), yet he did
not give him a particular account by revelation at what times, and by
what steps, it should go away, 1. Because the knowledge of the former
was necessary to his preparing the ark, and settling himself in it; but
the knowledge of the latter would serve only to gratify his curiosity,
and the concealing of it from him would be the needful exercise of his
faith and patience. And, 2. He could not foresee the flood, but by
revelation; but he might, by ordinary means, discover the decrease of
it, and therefore God was pleased to leave him to the use of them.

II\. That though Noah by faith expected his enlargement, and by patience
waited for it, yet he was inquisitive concerning it, as one that thought
it long to be thus confined. Note, Desires of release out of trouble,
earnest expectations of it, and enquiries concerning its advances
towards us, will very well consist with the sincerity of faith and
patience. He that believes does not make haste to run before God, but he
does make haste to go forth to meet him, [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md). Particularly, 1. Noah sent
forth a raven through the window of the ark, which went forth, as the
Hebrew phrase is, going forth and returning, that is, flying about, and
feeding on the carcases that floated, but returning to the ark for rest;
probably not in it, but upon it. This gave Noah little satisfaction;
therefore, 2. He sent forth a dove, which returned the first time with
no good news, but probably wet and dirty; but, the second time, she
brought an olive-leaf in her bill, which appeared to be first plucked
off, a plain indication that now the trees, the fruit-trees, began to
appear above water. Note here, (1.) That Noah sent forth the dove the
second time seven days after the first time, and the third time was
after seven days too; and probably the first sending of her out was
seven days after the sending forth of the raven. This intimates that it
was done on the sabbath day, which, it should seem, Noah religiously
observed in the ark. Having kept the sabbath in a solemn assembly of his
little church, he then expected special blessings from heaven, and
enquired concerning them. Having directed his prayer, he looked up, [Psa
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#003). (2..md) The dove is an emblem of a
gracious soul, which finding no rest for its foot, no solid peace or
satisfaction in this world, this deluged defiling world, returns to
Christ as to its ark, as to its Noah. The carnal heart, like the raven,
takes up with the world, and feeds on the carrions it finds there; but
return thou to thy rest, O my soul, to thy Noah, so the word is, [Psa
116:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#007.md). O that I had wings like a dove,
to flee to him! [Psa 55:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#006.md). And as Noah
put forth his hand, and took the dove, and pulled her in to him, into
the ark, so Christ will graciously preserve, and help, and welcome,
those that fly to him for rest. (3.) The olive-branch, which was an
emblem of peace, was brought, not by the raven, a bird of prey, nor by a
gay and proud peacock, but by a mild, patient, humble dove. It is a
dove-like disposition that brings into the world earnests of rest and
joy. (4.) Some make these things an allegory. The law was first sent
forth like the raven, but brought no tidings of the assuaging of the
waters of God's wrath, with which the world of mankind was deluged;
therefore, in the fulness of time, God sent forth his gospel, as the
dove, in the likeness of which the Holy Spirit descended, and this
presents us with an olive-branch and brings in a better hope.

[Genesis 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 8:13</span></span>

Here is, 1. The ground dry ([Gen
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#013).md), that is, all the water carried
off it, which, upon the first day of the first month (a joyful
new-year's-day it was), Noah was himself an eye-witness of. He removed
the covering of the ark, not the whole covering, but so much as would
suffice to give him a prospect of the earth about it; and a most
comfortable prospect he had. For behold, behold and wonder, the face of
the ground was dry. Note, (1.) It is a great mercy to see ground about
us. Noah was more sensible of it than we are; for mercies restored are
much more affecting than mercies continued. (2.) The divine power which
now renewed the face of the earth can renew the face of an afflicted
troubled soul and of a distressed persecuted church. He can make dry
ground to appear even where it seemed to have been lost and forgotten,
[Psa 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#016.md). 2. The ground dried ([Gen
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#014).md), so as to be a fit habitation
for Noah. Observe, Though Noah saw the ground dry the first day of the
first month, yet God would not suffer him to go out of the ark till the
twenty-seventh day of the second month. Perhaps Noah, being somewhat
weary of his restraint, would have quitted the ark at first; but God, in
kindness to him, ordered him to stay so much longer. Note, God consults
our benefit rather than our desires; for he knows what is good for us
better than we do for ourselves, and how long it is fit our restraints
should continue and desired mercies should be delayed. We would go out
of the ark before the ground is dried: and perhaps, if the door be shut,
are ready to remove the covering, and to climb up some other way; but we
should be satisfied that God's time of showing mercy is certainly the
best time, when the mercy is ripe for us and we are ready for it.

[Genesis 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 8:15</span></span>

Here is, I. Noah's dismission out of the ark, [Gen
8:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#015.md). Observe, 1. Noah did not stir
till God bade him. As he had a command to go into the ark ([Gen
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#001).md), so, how tedious soever his
confinement there was, he would wait for a command to go out of it
again. Note, We must in all our ways acknowledge God, and set him before
us in all our removes. Those only go under God's protection that follow
God's direction and submit to his government. Those that steadily adhere
to God's word as their rule, and are guided by his grace as their
principle, and take hints from his providence to assist them in their
application of general directions to particular cases, may in faith see
him guiding their motions in their march through this wilderness. 2.
Though God detained him long, yet at last he gave him his discharge; for
the vision is for an appointed time, and at the end it shall speak, it
shall speak truth ([Hab 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003).md), it shall
not lie. 3. God had said, Come into the ark which he says, not, Come
forth, but, Go forth, which intimates that God, who went in with him,
staid with him all the while, till he sent him out safely; for he has
said, I will not leave thee. 4. Some observe that, when they were
ordered into the ark, the men and the women were mentioned separately
([Gen 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#018).md): Thou, and thy sons, and
thy wife, and thy sons' wives; hence they infer that, during the time of
mourning, they were apart, and their wives apart, [Zac
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#012.md). But now God did as it were new
- marry them, sending out Noah and his wife together, and his sons and
their wives together, that they might be fruitful and multiply. 5. Noah
was ordered to bring the creatures out with him, that having taken the
care of feeding them so long, and been at so much pains about them, he
might have the honour of leading them forth by their armies, and
receiving their homage.

II\. Noah's departure when he had his dismission. As he would not go out
without leave, so he would not, out of fear or humour, stay in when he
had leave, but was in all points observant of the heavenly vision.
Though he had been now a full year and ten days a prisoner in the ark,
yet when he found himself preserved there, not only for a new life, but
for a new world, he saw no reason to complain of his long confinement.
Now observe, 1. Noah and his family came out alive, though one of them
was a wicked Ham, whom, though he escaped the flood, God's justice could
have taken away by some other stroke. But they are all alive. Note, When
families have been long continued together, and no breaches made among
them, it must be looked upon as a distinguishing favour, and attributed
to the Lord's mercies. 2. Noah brought out all the creatures that went
in with him, except the raven and the dove, which, probably, were ready
to meet their mates at their coming out. Noah was able to give a very
good account of his charge; for of all that were given to him he had
lost none, but was faithful to him that appointed him, pro hac vice - on
this occasion, high steward of his household.

[Genesis 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 8:20</span></span>

Here is, I. Noah's thankful acknowledgment of God's favour to him, in
completing the mercy of his deliverance, [Gen
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#020.md). 1. He built an altar. Hitherto
he had done nothing without particular instructions and commands from
God. He had a particular call into the ark, and another out of it; but,
altars and sacrifices being already of divine institution for religious
worship, he did not stay for a particular command thus to express his
thankfulness. Those that have received mercy from God should be forward
in returning thanks, and do it not of constraint, but willingly. God is
pleased with free-will offerings, and praises that wait for him. Noah
was now turned out into a cold and desolate world, where, one would have
thought, his first care would have been to build a house for himself;
but, behold, he begins with an altar for God: God, that is the first,
must be first served; and he begins well that begins with God. 2. He
offered a sacrifice upon his altar, of every clean beast, and of every
clean fowl - one, the odd seventh that we read of, [Gen
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#002.md), [Gen
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#003). Here observe, (1..md) He offered
only those that were clean; for it is not enough that we sacrifice, but
we must sacrifice that which God appoints, according to the law of
sacrifice, and not a corrupt thing. (2.) Though his stock of cattle was
so small, and that rescued from ruin at so great an expense of care and
pains, yet he did not grudge to give God his dues out of it. He might
have said, "Have I but seven sheep to begin the world with, and must one
of these seven be killed and burnt for sacrifice? Were it not better to
defer it till we have greater plenty?" No, to prove the sincerity of his
love and gratitude, he cheerfully gives the seventh to his God, as an
acknowledgment that all was his, and owing to him. Serving God with our
little is the way to make it more; and we must never think that wasted
with which God is honoured. (3.) See here the antiquity of religion: the
first thing we find done in the new world was an act of worship, [Jer
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#016.md). We are now to express our
thankfulness, not by burnt-offerings, but by the sacrifices of praise
and the sacrifices of righteousness, by pious devotions and a pious
conversation.

II\. God's gracious acceptance of Noah's thankfulness. It was a settled
rule in the patriarchal age: If thou doest well, shalt thou not be
accepted? Noah was so. For,

1\. God was well pleased with the performance, [Gen
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021.md). He smelt a sweet savour, or, as
it is in the Hebrew, a savour of rest, from it. As, when he had made the
world at first on the seventh day, he rested and was refreshed, so, now
that he had new-made it, in the sacrifice of the seventh he rested. He
was well pleased with Noah's pious zeal, and these hopeful beginnings of
the new world, as men are with fragrant and agreeable smells; though his
offering was small it was according to his ability, and God accepted it.
Having caused his anger to rest upon the world of sinners, he here
caused his love to rest upon this little remnant of believers.

2\. Hereupon, he took up a resolution never to drown the world again.
Herein he had an eye, not so much to Noah's sacrifice as to Christ's
sacrifice of himself, which was typified and represented by it, and
which was indeed an offering of a sweet-smelling savour, [Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002.md). Good security is here given, and
that which may be relied upon,

(1.) That this judgment should never be repeated. Noah might think, "To
what purpose should the world be repaired, when, in all probability, for
the wickedness of it, it will quickly be in like manner ruined again?"
"No," says God, "it never shall." It was said ([Gen
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#006).md), It repented the Lord that he had
made man; now here he speaks as if it repented him that he had destroyed
man: neither means a change of his mind, but both a change of his way.
It repented him concerning his servants, [Deu
32:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036.md). Two ways this resolve is
expressed: - \[1.\] I will not again curse the ground, Heb. I will not
add to curse the ground any more. God had cursed the ground upon the
first entrance of sin ([Gen 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#017).md),
when he drowned it he added to that curse; but now he determines not to
add to it any more. \[2.\] Neither will I again smite any more every
living thing; that is, it was determined that whatever ruin God might
bring upon particular persons, or families, or countries, he would never
again destroy the whole world till the day shall come when time shall be
no more. But the reason of this resolve is very surprising, for it seems
the same in effect with the reason given for the destruction of the
world: Because the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth,
[Gen 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#005.md). But there is this difference
- there it is said, The imagination of man's heart is evil continually,
that is, "his actual transgressions continually cry against him;" here
it is said, It is evil from his youth or childhood. It is bred in the
bone; he brought it into the world with him; he was shapen and conceived
in it. Now, one would think it should follow, "Therefore that guilty
race shall be wholly extinguished, and I will make a full end." No,
"Therefore I will no more take this severe method; for," First, "He is
rather to be pitied, for it is all the effect of sin dwelling in him;
and it is but what might be expected from such a degenerate race: he is
called a transgressor from the womb, and therefore it is not strange
that he deals so very treacherously," [Isa
48:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#008.md). Thus God remembers that he is
flesh, corrupt and sinful, [Psa 78:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#039.md).
Secondly, "He will be utterly ruined; for, if he be dealt with according
to his deserts, one flood must succeed another till all be destroyed."
See here, 1. That outward judgments, though they may terrify and
restrain men, yet cannot of themselves sanctify and renew them; the
grace of God must work with those judgments. Man's nature was as sinful
after the deluge as it had been before. 2. That God's goodness takes
occasion from man's sinfulness to magnify itself the more; his reasons
of mercy are all drawn from himself, not from any thing in us.

(2.) That the course of nature should never be discontinued ([Gen
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#022).md): "While the earth remaineth, and
man upon it, there shall be summer and winter (not all winter as had
been this last year), day and night," not all night, as probably it was
while the rain was descending. Here, \[1.\] It is plainly intimated that
this earth is not to remain always; it, and all the works in it, must
shortly be burnt up; and we look for new heavens and a new earth, when
all these things must be dissolved. But, \[2.\] As long as it does
remain God's providence will carefully preserve the regular succession
of times and seasons, and cause each to know its place. To this we owe
it that the world stands, and the wheel of nature keeps it track. See
here how changeable the times are and yet how unchangeable. First, The
course of nature always changing. As it is with the times, so it is with
the events of time, they are subject to vicissitudes - day and night,
summer and winter, counterchanged. In heaven and hell it is not so, but
on earth God hath set the one over against the other. Secondly, Yet
never changed. It is constant in this inconstancy. These seasons have
never ceased, nor shall cease, while the sun continued such a steady
measurer of time and the moon such a faithful witness in heaven. This is
God's covenant of the day and of the night, the stability of which is
mentioned for the confirming of our faith in the covenant of grace,
which is no less inviolable, [Jer
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#020.md), [Jer
33:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#021.md). We see God's promises to the
creatures made good, and thence may infer that his promises to all
believers shall be so.
