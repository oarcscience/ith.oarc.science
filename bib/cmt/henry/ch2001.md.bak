### [2 Chronicles Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

In the close of the foregoing book we read how God magnified Solomon and
Israel obeyed him; God and Israel concurred to honour him. Now here we
have an account, I. How he honoured God by sacrifice ([Ch2
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001).md) and by prayer ([Ch2
1:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#007).md). II. How he honoured Israel by
increasing their strength, wealth, and trade ([Ch2
1:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#013).md).

[2 Chronicles 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 1:1</span></span>

Here is, I. Solomon's great prosperity, [Ch2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md). Though he had a contested title,
yet, God being with him, he was strengthened in his kingdom; his heart
and hands were strengthened, and his interest in the people. God's
presence will be our strength.

II\. His great piety and devotion. His father was a prophet, a psalmist,
and kept mostly to the ark; but Solomon, having read much in his Bible
concerning the tabernacle which Moses built and the altars there, paid
more respect to them than, it should seem, David had done. Both did
well, and let neither be censured. If the zeal of one be carried out
most to one instance of religion, and of another to some other instance,
let them not judge nor despise each other.

1\. All his great men must thus far be good men that they must join with
him in worshipping God. He spoke to the captains and judges, the
governors and chief of the fathers, to go with him to Gibeon, [Ch2
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#002.md), [Ch2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#003.md). Authority and interest are well
bestowed on those that will thus use them for the glory of God, and the
promoting of religion. It is our duty to engage all with whom we have
influence in the solemnities of religion, and it is very desirable to
have many join with us in those solemnities - the more the better; it is
the more like heaven. Solomon began his reign with this public pious
visit to God's altar, and it was a very good omen. Magistrates are then
likely to do well for themselves and their people when they thus take
God along with them at their setting out.

2\. He offered abundance of sacrifices to God there ([Ch2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#006).md): 1000 burnt-offerings, and
perhaps a greater number of peace-offerings, on which he and his company
feasted before the Lord. Where God sows plentifully he expects to reap
accordingly. His father David had left him flocks and herds in abundance
([Ch1 27:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#029.md), [Ch1
27:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#031).md), and thus he gave God his dues
out of them. The ark was at Jerusalem ([Ch2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#004).md), but the altar was at Gibeon
([Ch2 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#005).md), and thither he brought his
sacrifices; for it is the altar that sanctifieth every gift.

3\. He prayed a good prayer to God: this, with the answer to it, we had
before, [Kg1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005), etc. (1..md) God bade
him ask what he would; not only that he might put him in the right way
of obtaining the favours that were intended him (Ask, and you shall
receive, that your joy may be full), but that he might try him, how he
stood affected, and might discover what was in his heart. Men's
characters appear in their choices and desires. What wouldst thou have?
tries a man as much as, What wouldst thou do? Thus God tried whether
Solomon was one of the children of this world, that say, Who will show
us any good, or of the children of light, that say, Lord, lift up the
light of thy countenance upon us. As we choose we shall have, and that
is likely to be our portion to which we give the preference, whether the
wealth and pleasure of this world or spiritual riches or delights. (2.)
Like a genuine son of David, he chose spiritual blessings rather than
temporal. His petition here is, Give me wisdom and knowledge. He owns
those to be desirable gifts, and God to be the giver of them, [Pro
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#006.md). God gave the faculty of
understanding, and to him we must apply for the furniture of it. Two
things are here pleaded which we had not in Kings: - \[1.\] Thou hast
made me reign in my father's stead, [Ch2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#008.md). "Lord, thou hast put me into this
place, and therefore I can in faith ask of thee grace to enable me to do
the duty of it." What service we have reason to believe God calls us to
we have reason to hope he will qualify us for. But that is not all.
"Lord, thou hast put me into this place in the stead of David, the great
and good man that filled it up so well; therefore give me wisdom, that
Israel may not suffer damage by the change. Must I reign in my father's
stead? Lord, give me my father's spirit." Note, The eminency of those
that went before us, and the obligation that lies upon us to keep up and
carry on the good work they were engaged in, should provoke us to a
gracious emulation, and quicken our prayers to God for wisdom and grace,
that we may do the work of God in our day as faithfully and well as they
did in theirs. \[2.\] Let thy promise to David my father be established,
[Ch2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#009.md). He means the promise of
concerning his successor. "In performance of that promise, Lord, give me
wisdom." We do not find that wisdom was any of the things promised, but
it was necessary in order to the accomplishment of what was promised,
[Sa2 7:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013.md). The promise was, He
shall build a house for my name, I will establish his throne, he shall
be my son, and my mercy shall not depart from him. "Now, Lord, unless
thou give me wisdom, thy house will not be built, nor my throne
established; I shall behave in a manner unbecoming my relation to thee
as a Father, shall forfeit thy mercy, and fool it away; therefore, Lord,
give me wisdom." Note, First, God's promises are our best pleas in
prayer. Remember thy word unto thy servant. Secondly, Children may take
the comfort of the promises of that covenant which their parents, in
their baptism, laid claim to, and took hold of, for them. Thirdly, The
best way to obtain the benefit of the promises and privileges of the
covenant is to be earnest in prayer with God for wisdom and grace to do
the duties of it.

4\. He received a gracious answer to this prayer, [Ch2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#011.md), [Ch2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#012). (1..md) God gave him the wisdom
that he asked for because he asked for it. Wisdom is a gift that God
gives as freely and liberally as any gift to those that value it, and
wrestle for it; and will resolve to make use of it; and he upbraids not
the poor petitioners with their folly, [Jam
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005.md). God's grace shall never be
wanting to those who sincerely desire to know and do their duty. (2.)
God gave him the wealth and honour which he did not ask for because he
asked not for them. Those that pursue present things most earnestly are
most likely to miss of them; while those that refer themselves to the
providence of God, if they have not the most of those things, have the
most comfort in them. Those that make this world their end come short of
the other and are disappointed in this too; but those that make the
other world their end shall not only obtain that, and full satisfaction
in it, but shall enjoy as much as is convenient of this world in their
way.

[2 Chronicles 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 1:13</span></span>

Here is, 1. Solomon's entrance upon the government ([Ch2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#013).md): He came from before the
tabernacle, and reigned over Israel. He would not do any acts of
government till he had done his acts of devotion, would not take honour
to himself till he had given honour to God - first the tabernacle, and
then the throne. But, when he had obtained wisdom from God, he did not
bury his talent, but as he received the gift ministered the same, did
not give up himself to ease and pleasure, but minded business: he
reigned over Israel. 2. The magnificence of his court ([Ch2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#014).md): He gathered chariots and
horsemen. Shall we praise him for this? We praise him not; for the king
was forbidden to multiply horses, [Deu
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#016.md). I do not remember that ever we
find his good father in a chariot or on horseback; a mule was the
highest he mounted. We should endeavor to excel those that went before
us in goodness rather than in grandeur. 3. The wealth and trade of his
kingdom. He made silver and gold very cheap and common, [Ch2
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#015.md). The increase of gold lowers the
value of it; but the increase of grace advances its price; the more men
have of that the more they value it. How much better therefore is it to
get wisdom than gold! He opened also a trade with Egypt, whence he
imported horses and linen-yarn, which he exported again to the kings of
Syria, with great advantage no doubt, [Ch2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#016.md), [Ch2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#017.md). This we had before, [Kg1
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028.md), [Kg1
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029.md). It is the wisdom of princes to
promote industry and encourage trade in their dominions. Perhaps Solomon
took the hint of setting up the linen-manufacture, bringing linen-yarn
out of Egypt, working it into cloth, and then sending that to other
nations, from what his mother taught when she specified this as one of
the characteristics of the virtuous woman, She maketh fine linen, and
selleth it, and delivereth girdles of it to the merchant, [Pro
31:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#024.md). In all labour there is profit.
