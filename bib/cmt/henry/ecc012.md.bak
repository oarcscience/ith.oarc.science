### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ecc 12:0</span></span>

The wise and penitent preacher is here closing his sermon; and he closes
it, not only lie a good orator, but like a good preacher, with that
which was likely to make the best impressions and which he wished might
be powerful and lasting upon his hearers. Here is, I. An exhortation to
young people to begin betimes to be religious and not to put it off to
old age ([Ecc 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#001).md), enforced with
arguments taken from the calamities of old age ([Ecc
12:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#001).md). and the great change that
death will make upon us ([Ecc 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#006.md),
[Ecc 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007).md). II. A repetition of the
great truth he had undertaken to prove in this discourse, the vanity of
the world ([Ecc 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#008).md). III. A
confirmation and recommendation of what he had written in this and his
other books, as worthy to be duly weighed and concluded, with a charge
to all to be truly religious, in consideration of the judgment to come
([Ecc 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#013.md), [Ecc
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#014).md).

[Ecclesiastes 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 12:1</span></span>

Here is, I. A call to young people to think of God, and mind their duty
to him, when they are young: Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy
youth. This is, 1. The royal preacher's application of his sermon
concerning the vanity of the world and every thing in it. "You that are
young flatter yourselves with expectations of great things from it, but
believe those that have tried it; it yields no solid satisfaction to a
soul; therefore, that you may not be deceived by this vanity, nor too
much disturbed by it, remember your Creator, and so guard yourselves
against the mischiefs that arise from the vanity of the creature." 2. It
is the royal physician's antidote against the particular diseases of
youth, the love of mirth, and the indulgence of sensual pleasures, the
vanity which childhood and youth are subject to; to prevent and cure
this, remember thy Creator. Here is, (1.) A great duty pressed upon us,
to remember God as our creator, not only to remember that God is our
Creator, that he made us and not we ourselves, and is therefore our
rightful Lord and owner, but we must engage ourselves to him with the
considerations which his being our Creator lay us under, and pay him the
honour and duty which we owe him as our Creator. Remember thy Creators;
the word is plural, as it is [Job
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#010.md), Where is God my Makers? For God
said, Let us make man, us, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. (2.) The proper
season for this duty - in the days of thy youth, the days of thy choice
(so some), thy choice days, thy choosing days. "Begin in the beginning
of thy days to remember him from whom thou hadst thy being, and go on
according to that good beginning. Call him to mind when thou art young,
and keep him in mind throughout all the days of thy youth, and never
forget him. Guard thus against the temptations of youth, and thus
improve the advantages of it."

II\. A reason to enforce this command: While the evil days come not, and
the years of which thou shalt say I have no pleasure in them.

1\. Do it quickly, (1.) "Before sickness and death come. Do it while
thou livest, for it will be too late to do it when death has removed
thee from this state of trial and probation to that of recompence and
retribution." The days of sickness and death are the days of evil,
terrible to nature, evil days indeed to those that have forgotten their
Creator. These evil days will come sooner or later; as yet they come
not, for God is long-suffering to us-ward, and gives us space to repent;
the continuing of life is but the deferring of death, and, while life is
continued and death deferred, it concerns us to prepare, and get the
property of death altered, that we may die comfortably. (2.) Before old
age comes, which, if death prevent not, will come, and they will be
years of which we shall say, We have no pleasure in them, - when we
shall not relish the delights of sense, as Barzillai ([Sa2
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#035).md), - when we shall be loaded with
bodily infirmities, old and blind, or old and lame, - when we shall be
taken off from our usefulness, and our strength shall be labour and
sorrow, - when we shall either have parted with our relations, and all
our old friends, or be afflicted in them and see them weary of us, -
when we shall feel ourselves die by inches. These years draw nigh, when
all that comes will be vanity, the remaining months all months of
vanity, and there will be no pleasure but in the reflection of a good
life on earth and the expectation of a better life in heaven.

2\. These two arguments he enlarges upon in the following verses, only
inverting the order, and shows,

(1.) How many are the calamities of old age, and that if we should live
to be old, our days will be such as we shall have no pleasure in, which
is a good reason why we should return to God, and make our peace with
him, in the days of our youth, and not put it off till we come to be
old; for it will be no thanks to us to leave the pleasures of sin when
they have left us, nor to return to God when need forces us. It is the
greatest absurdity and ingratitude imaginable to give the cream and
flower of our days to the devil, and reserve the bran, and refuse, and
dregs of them for God; this is offering the torn, and the lame, and the
sick for sacrifice; and, besides, old age being thus clogged with
infirmities, it is the greatest folly imaginable to put off that needful
work till then, which requires the best of our strength, when our
faculties are in their prime, and especially to make the work more
difficult by a longer continuance in sin, and, laying up treasures of
guilt in the conscience, to add to the burdens of age and make them much
heavier. If the calamities of age will be such as are here represented,
we shall have need of something to support and comfort us then, and
nothing will be more effectual to do that than the testimony of our
consciences for us that we begin betimes to remember our Creator and
have not since laid aside the remembrance of him. How can we expect God
should help us when we are old, if we will not serve him when we are
young? See [Psa 71:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#017.md), [Psa
71:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#018.md).

\[1.\] The decays and infirmities of old age are here elegantly
described in figurative expressions, which have some difficulty in them
to us now, who are not acquainted with the common phrases and metaphors
used in Solomon's age and language; but the general scope is plain - to
show how uncomfortable, generally, the days of old age are. First, Then
the sun and the light of it, the moon and the stars, and the light which
they borrow from it, will be darkened. They look dim to old people, in
consequence of the decay of their sight; their countenance is clouded,
and the beauty and lustre of it are eclipsed; their intellectual powers
and faculties, which are as lights in the soul, are weakened; their
understanding and memory fail them, and their apprehension is not so
quick nor their fancy so lively as it has been; the days of their mirth
are over (light is often put for joy and prosperity) and they have not
the pleasure either of the converse of the day or the repose of the
night, for both the sun and the moon are darkened to them. Secondly,
Then the clouds return after the rain; as, when the weather is disposed
to wet, no sooner has one cloud blown over than another succeeds it, so
it is with old people, when they have got free from one pain or ailment,
they are seized with another, so that their distempers are like a
continual dropping in a very rainy day. The end of one trouble is, in
this world, but the beginning of another, and deep calls unto deep. Old
people are often afflicted with defluxions of rheum, like soaking rain,
after which still more clouds return, feeding the humour, so that it is
continually grievous, and therein the body, as it were, melts away.
Thirdly, Then the keepers of the house tremble. The head, which is as
the watch-tower, shakes, and the arms and hands, which are ready for the
preservation of the body, shake too, and grow feeble, upon every sudden
approach and attack of danger. That vigour of the animal spirits which
used to be exerted for self-defence fails and cannot do its office; old
people are easily dispirited and discouraged. Fourthly, Then the strong
men shall bow themselves; the legs and thighs, which used to support the
body, and bear its weight, bend, and cannot serve for travelling as they
have done, but are soon tired. Old men that have been in their time
strong men become weak and stoop for age, [Zac
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#004.md). God takes no pleasure in the legs
of a man ([Psa 147:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#010).md), for their
strength will soon fail; but in the Lord Jehovah there is everlasting
strength; he has everlasting arms. Fifthly, Then the grinders cease
because they are few; the teeth, with which we grind our meat and
prepare it for concoction, cease to do their part, because they are few.
They are rotted and broken, and perhaps have been drawn because they
ached. Some old people have lost all their teeth, and others have but
few left; and this infirmity is the more considerable because the meat,
not being well chewed, for want of teeth, is not well digested, which
has as much influence as any thing upon the other decays of age.
Sixthly, Those that look out of the windows are darkened; the eyes wax
dim, as Isaac's ([Gen 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#001).md), and
Ahijah's, [Kg1 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#004.md). Moses was a rare
instance of one who, when 120 years old, had good eye-sight, but
ordinarily the sight decays in old people as soon as any thing, and it
is a mercy to them that art helps nature with spectacles. We have need
to improve our sight well while we have it, because the light of the
eyes may be gone before the light of life. Seventhly, The doors are shut
in the streets. Old people keep within doors, and care not for going
abroad to entertainments. The lips, the doors of the mouth, are shut in
eating, because the teeth are gone and the sound of the grinding with
them is low, so that they have not that command of their meat in their
mouths which they used to have; they cannot digest their meat, and
therefore little grist is brought to the mill. Eightly, Old people rise
up at the voice of the bird. They have no sound sleep as young people
have, but a little thing disturbs them, even the chirping of a bird;
they cannot rest for coughing, and therefore rise up at cock-crowing, as
soon as any body is stirring; or they are apt to be jealous, and
timorous, and full of care, which breaks their sleep and makes them rise
early; or they are apt to be superstitious, and rise up as in a fright,
at those voices of birds, as of ravens, or screech-owls, which
soothsayers call ominous. Ninthly, With them all the daughters of music
are brought low. They have neither voice nor ear, can neither sing
themselves nor take any pleasure, as Solomon had done in the days of his
youth, in singing men, and singing women, and musical instruments, [Ecc
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#008.md). Old people grow hard of hearing,
and unapt to distinguish sounds and voices. Tenthly, They are afraid of
that which is high, afraid to go to the top of any high place, either
because, for want of breath, they cannot reach it, or, their heads being
giddy or their legs failing them, they dare not venture to it, or they
frighten themselves with fancying that that which is high will fall upon
them. Fear is in the way; they can neither ride nor walk with their
former boldness, but are afraid of every thing that lies in their way,
lest it throw them down. Eleventhly, The almond-tree flourishes. The old
man's hair has grown white, so that his head looks like an almond-tree
in the blossom. The almond-tree blossoms before any other tree, and
therefore fitly shows what haste old age makes in seizing upon men; it
prevents their expectations and comes faster upon them than they thought
of. Gray hairs are here and there upon them, and they perceive it not.
Twelfthly, The grasshopper is a burden and desire fails. Old men can
bear nothing; the lightest thing sits heavily upon them, both on their
bodies and on their minds, a little thing sinks and breaks them. Perhaps
the grasshopper was some food that was looked upon to be very light of
digestion (John Baptist's meat was locusts), but even that lies heavily
upon an old man's stomach, and therefore desire fails, he has no
appetite to his meat, neither shall he regard the desire of woman, as
that king, [Dan 11:37](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#037.md). Old men become
mindless and listless, and the pleasures of sense are to them tasteless
and sapless.

\[2.\] It is probable that Solomon wrote this when he was himself old,
and could speak feelingly of the infirmities of age, which perhaps grew
the faster upon him for the indulgence he had given himself in sensual
pleasures. Some old people bear up better than others under the decays
of age, but, more or less, the days of old age are and will be evil days
and of little pleasure. Great care therefore should be taken to pay
respect and honour to old people, that they may have something to
balance these grievances and nothing may be done to add to them. And all
this, put together, makes up a good reason why we should remember our
Creator in the days of our youth, that he may remember us with favour
when these evil days come, and his comforts may delight our souls when
the delights of sense are in a manner worn off.

(2.) He shows how great a change death will make with us, which will be
either the prevention or the period of the miseries of old age. Nothing
else will keep them off, nor any thing else cure them. "Therefore
remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth, because death is
certainly before thee, perhaps it is very near thee, and it is a serious
thing to die, and thou shouldst feel concerned with the utmost care and
diligence to prepare for it." \[1.\] Death will fix us in an
unchangeable state: Man shall then go to his long home, and all these
infirmities and decays of age are harbingers of and advances towards
that awful remove. At death man goes from this world and all the
employments and enjoyments of it. He has gone for good and all, as to
his present state. He has gone home, for here he was a stranger and
pilgrim; both soul and body go to the place whence they came, [Ecc
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007.md). He has gone to his rest, to the
place where he is to fix. He has gone to his home, to the house of his
world (so some), for this world is not his. He has gone to his long
home, for the days of his lying in the grave will be many. He has gone
to his house of eternity, not only to his house whence he shall never
return to this world, but to the house where he must be for ever. This
should make us willing to die, that, at death, we must go home; and why
should we not long to go to our Father's house? And this should quicken
us to get ready to die, that we must then go to our long home, to an
everlasting habitation. \[2.\] Death will be an occasion of sorrow to
our friends that love us. When man goes to his long home the mourners go
about the streets - the real mourners, and those, as now with us,
distinguished by their habits as they go along the streets, - the
mourners for ceremony, that were hired to weep for the dead, both to
express and to excite the real mourning. When we die we not only remove
to a melancholy house before us, but we leave a melancholy house behind
us. Tears are a tribute due to the dead, and this, among other
circumstances, makes it a serious thing to die. But in vain do we go to
the house of mourning, and see the mourners go about the streets, if it
do not help to make us serious and pious mourners in the closet. \[3.\]
Death will dissolve the frame of nature and take down the earthly house
of this tabernacle, which is elegantly described, [Ecc
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#006.md). Then shall the silver cord, by
which soul and body were wonderfully fastened together, be loosed, that
sacred knot untied, and those old friends be forced to part; then shall
the golden bowl, which held the waters of life for us, be broken; then
shall the pitcher with which we used to fetch up water, for the constant
support of life and the repair of its decays, be broken, even at the
fountain, so that it can fetch up no more; and the wheel (all those
organs that serve for the collecting and distributing of nourishment)
shall be broken, and disabled to do their office any more. The body
shall become like a watch when the spring is broken, the motion of all
the wheels is stopped and they all stand still; the machine is taken to
pieces; the heart beats no more, nor does the blood circulate. Some
apply this to the ornaments and utensils of life; rich people must, at
death, leave behind them their clothing and furniture of silver and
gold, and poor people their earthen pitchers, and the drawers of water
will have their wheel broken. \[4.\] Death will resolve us into our
first principles, [Ecc 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007.md). Man is a
strange sort of creature, a ray of heaven united to a clod of earth; at
death these are separated, and each goes to the place whence it came.
First, The body, that clod of clay, returns to its own earth. It is made
of the earth; Adam's body was so, and we are of the same mould; it is a
house of clay. At death it is laid in the earth, and in a little time
will be resolved into earth, not to be distinguished from common earth,
according to the sentence ([Gen 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#019).md),
Dust thou art and therefore to dust thou shalt return. Let us not
therefore indulge the appetites of the body, nor pamper it (it will be
worms' meat shortly), nor let sin reign in our mortal bodies, for they
are mortal, [Rom 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#012.md). Secondly, The
soul, that beam of light, returns to that God who, when he made man of
the dust of the ground, breathed into him the breath of life, to make
him a living soul ([Gen 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007).md), and
forms the spirit of every man within him. When the fire consumes the
wood the flame ascends, and the ashes return to the earth out of which
the wood grew. The soul does not die with the body; it is redeemed from
the power of the grave ([Psa 49:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#015).md);
it can subsist without it and will in a state of separation from it, as
the candle burns, and burns brighter, when it is taken out of the dark
lantern. It removes to the world of spirits, to which it is allied. It
goes to God as a Judge, to give account of itself, and to be lodged
either with the spirits in prison ([Pe1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#019).md) or with the spirits in paradise
([Luk 23:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#043).md), according to what was
done in the body. This makes death terrible to the wicked, whose souls
go to God as an avenger, and comfortable to the godly, whose souls go to
God as a Father, into whose hands they cheerfully commit them, through a
Mediator, out of whom sinners may justly dread to think of going to God.

[Ecclesiastes 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 12:8</span></span>

Solomon is here drawing towards a close, and is loth to part till he has
gained his point, and prevailed with his hearers, with his readers, to
seek for that satisfaction in God only and in their duty to him which
they can never find in the creature.

I. He repeats his text ([Ecc 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#008).md), 1.
As that which he had fully demonstrated the truth of, and so made good
his undertaking in this sermon, wherein he had kept closely to his text,
and both his reasons and his application were to the purpose. 2. As that
which he desired to inculcate both upon others and upon himself, to have
it ready, and to make use of it upon all occasions. We see it daily
proved; let it therefore be daily improved: Vanity of vanities, all is
vanity.

II\. He recommends what he had written upon this subject by divine
direction and inspiration to our serious consideration. The words of
this book are faithful, and well worthy our acceptance, for,

1\. They are the words of one that was a convert, a penitent, that could
speak by dear-bought experience of the vanity of the world and the folly
of expecting great things from it. He was Coheleth, one gathered in from
his wanderings and gathered home to that God from whom he had revolted.
Vanity of vanities, saith the penitent. All true penitents are convinced
of the vanity of the world, for they find it can do nothing to ease them
of the burden of sin, which they complain of.

2\. They are the words of one that was wise, wiser than any, endued with
extraordinary measures of wisdom, famous for it among his neighbours,
who all sought unto him to hear his wisdom, and therefore a competent
judge of this matter, not only wise as a prince, but wise as a preacher
- and preachers have need of wisdom to win souls.

3\. He was one that made it his business to do good, and to use wisdom
aright. Because he was himself wise, but knew he had not his wisdom for
himself, any more than he had it from himself, he still taught the
people that knowledge which he had found useful to himself, and hoped
might be so to them too. It is the interest of princes to have their
people well taught in religion, and no disparagement to them to teach
them themselves the good knowledge of the Lord, but their duty to
encourage those whose office it is to teach them and to speak
comfortably to them, [Ch2 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#022.md). Let
not the people, the common people, be despised, no, not by the wisest
and greatest, as either unworthy or incapable of good knowledge: even
those that are well taught have need to be still taught, that they may
grow in knowledge.

4\. He took a great deal of pains and care to do good, designing to
teach the people knowledge. He did not put them off with any thing that
came next to hand, because they were inferior people, and he a very wise
man, but considering the worth of the souls he preached to and the
weight of the subject he preached on, he gave good heed to what he read
and heard from others, that, having stocked himself well, he might bring
out of his treasury things new and old. He gave good heed to what he
spoke and wrote himself, and was choice and exact in it; all he did was
elaborate. (1.) He chose the most profitable way of preaching, by
proverbs or short sentences, which would be more easily apprehended and
remembered than long and laboured periods. (2.) He did not content
himself with a few parables, or wise sayings, and repeat them again and
again, but he furnished himself with many proverbs, a great variety of
grave discourses, that he might have something to say on every occasion.
(3.) He did not only give them such observations as were obvious and
trite, but he sought out such as were surprising and uncommon; he dug
into the mines of knowledge, and did not merely pick up what lay on the
surface. (4.) He did not deliver his heads and observations at random,
as they came to mind, but methodized them, and set them in order that
they might appear in more strength and lustre.

5\. He put what he had to say in such a dress as he thought would be
most pleasing: He sought to find out acceptable words, words of delight
([Ecc 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#010).md); he took care that good
matter might not be spoiled by a bad style, and by the ungratefulness
and incongruity of the expression. Ministers should study, not for the
big words, nor the fine words, but acceptable words, such as are likely
to please men for their good, to edification, [Co1
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#033.md). Those that would win souls must
contrive how to win upon them with words fitly spoken.

6\. That which he wrote for our instruction is of unquestionable
certainty, and what we may rely upon: That which was written was upright
and sincere, according to the real sentiments of the penman, even words
of truth, the exact representation of the thing as it is. Those are sure
not to miss their way who are guided by these words. What good will
acceptable words do us if they be not upright and words of truth? Most
are for smooth things, that flatter them, rather than right things, that
direct them ([Isa 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#010).md), but to those
that understand themselves, and their own interest, words of truth will
always be acceptable words.

7\. That which he and other holy men wrote will be of great use and
advantage to us, especially being inculcated upon us by the exposition
of it, [Ecc 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#011). Here observe, (1..md)
A double benefit accruing to us from divine truths if duly applied and
improved; they are profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction,
and instruction in righteousness. They are of use, \[1.\] To excite us
to our duty. They are as goads to the ox that draws the plough, putting
him forward when he is dull and quickening him, to amend his pace. The
truths of God prick men to the heart ([Act
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#037).md) and put them upon bethinking
themselves, when they trifle and grow remiss, and exerting themselves
with more vigour in their work. While our good affections are so apt as
they are to grow flat and cool, we have need of these goads. \[2.\] To
engage us to persevere in our duty. They are as nails to those that are
wavering and inconstant, to fix them to that which is good. They are as
goads to such as are dull and draw back, and nails to such as are
desultory and draw aside, means to establish the heart and confirm good
resolutions, that we may not sit loose to our duty, nor even be taken
off from it, but that what good there is in us may be as a nail fastened
in a sure place, [Ezr 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#008). (2..md) A
double way of communicating divine truths, in order to those benefits: -
\[1.\] By the scriptures, as the standing rule, the words of the wise,
that is, of the prophets, who are called wise men, [Mat
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#034.md). These we have in black and
white, and may have recourse to them at any time, and make use of them
as goads and as nails. By them we may teach ourselves; let them but come
with pungency and power to the soul, let the impressions of them be deep
and durable, and the will make us wise to salvation. \[2.\] By the
ministry. To make the words of the wise more profitable to us, it is
appointed that they should be impressed and fastened by the masters of
assemblies. Solemn assemblies for religious worship are an ancient
divine institution, intended for the honour of God and the edification
of his church, and are not only serviceable, but necessary, to those
ends. There must be masters of these assemblies, who are Christ's
ministers, and as such are to preside in them, to be God's mouth to the
people and theirs to God. Their business is to fasten the words of the
wise, and drive them as nails to the head, in order to which the word of
God is likewise as a hammer, [Jer
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#029.md).

8\. That which is written, and thus recommended to us, is of divine
origin. Though it comes to us through various hands (many wise men, and
many masters of assemblies), yet it is given by one and the same
shepherd, the great shepherd of Israel, that leads Joseph like a flock,
[Psa 80:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001.md). God is that one Shepherd,
whose good Spirit indited the scriptures, and assists the masters of the
assemblies in opening and applying the scriptures. These words of the
wise are the true sayings of God, on which we may rest our souls. From
that one Shepherd all ministers must receive what they deliver, and
speak according to the light of the written word.

9\. The sacred inspired writings, if we will but make use of them, are
sufficient to guide us in the way of true happiness, and we need not, in
the pursuit of that, to fatigue ourselves with the search of other
writings ([Ecc 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#012).md): "And further,
nothing now remains but to tell thee that that of making many books
there is no end," that is, (1.) Of writing many books. "If what I have
written, serve not to convince thee of the vanity of the world, and the
necessity of being religious, neither wouldst thou be convinced if I
should write ever so much." If the end be not attained in the use of
those books of scripture which God has blessed us with, neither should
we obtain the end, if we had twice as many more; nay, if we had so many
that the whole world could not contain them ([Joh
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#025).md), and much study of them would
but confound us, and would rather be a weariness to the flesh than any
advantage to the soul. We have as much as God saw fit to give us, saw
fit for us, and saw us fit for. Much less can it be expected that those
who will not by these be admonished should be wrought upon by other
writings. Let men write ever so many books for the conduct of human
life, write till they have tired themselves with much study, they cannot
give better instructions than those we have from the word of God. Or,
(2.) Of buying many books, making ourselves master of them, and masters
of what is in them, by much study; still the desire of learning would be
unsatisfied. It will give a man indeed the best entertainment and the
best accomplishment this world can afford him; but if we be not by these
admonished of the vanity of the world, and human learning, among other
things, and its insufficiency to make us happy without true piety, alas!
there is no end of it, nor real benefit by it; it will weary the body,
but never give the soul any true satisfaction. The great Mr. Selden
subscribed to this when he owned that in all the books he had read he
never found that on which he could rest his soul, but in the holy
scripture, especially [Tit 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011.md), [Tit
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#012.md). By these therefore let us be
admonished.

[Ecclesiastes 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 12:13</span></span>

The great enquiry which Solomon prosecutes in this book is, What is that
good which the sons of men should do? [Ecc
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#003.md). What is the true way to true
happiness, the certain means to attain our great end? He had in vain
sought it among those things which most men are eager in pursuit of, but
here, at length, he has found it, by the help of that discovery which
God anciently made to man ([Job
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028).md), that serious godliness is the
only way to true happiness: Let us hear the conclusion of the whole
matter, the return entered upon the writ of enquiry, the result of this
diligent search; you shall have all I have been driving at in two words.
He does not say, Do you hear it, but Let us hear it; for preachers must
themselves be hearers of that word which they preach to others, must
hear it as from God; those are teachers by the halves who teach others
and not themselves, [Rom 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#021.md). Every
word of God is pure and precious, but some words are worthy of more
special remark, as this; the Masorites begin it with a capital letter,
as that [Deu 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#004.md). Solomon himself puts
a nota bene before it, demanding attention in these words, Let us hear
the conclusion of the whole matter. Observe here,

I. The summary of religion. Setting aside all matters of doubtful
disputation, to be religious is to fear God and keep his commandments.
1. The root of religion is fear of God reigning in the heart, and a
reverence of his majesty, a deference to his authority, and a dread of
his wrath. Fear God, that is, worship God, give him the honour due to
his name, in all the instances of true devotion, inward and outward. See
[Rev 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#007.md). 2. The rule of religion is
the law of God revealed in the scriptures. Our fear towards God must be
taught by his commandments ([Isa
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013).md), and those we must keep and
carefully observe. Wherever the fear of God is uppermost in the heart,
there will be a respect to all his commandments and care to keep them.
In vain do we pretend to fear God if we do not make conscience of our
duty to him.

II\. The vast importance of it: This is the whole of man; it is all his
business and all his blessedness; our whole duty is summed up in this
and our whole comfort is bound up in this. It is the concern of every
man, and ought to be his chief and continual care; it is the common
concern of all men, of their whole time. It is nothing to a man whether
he be rich or poor, high or low, but it is the main matter, it is all in
all to a man, to fear God and do as he bids him.

III\. A powerful inducement to this, [Ecc
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#014.md). We shall see of what vast
consequence it is to us that we be religious if we consider the account
we must every one of us shortly give of himself to God; thence he argued
against a voluptuous and vicious life ([Ecc
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009).md), and here for a religious life:
God shall bring every work into judgment. Note, 1. There is a judgment
to come, in which every man's eternal state will be finally determined.
2. God himself will be the Judge, God-man will, not only because he has
a right to judge, but because he is perfectly fit for it, infinitely
wise and just. 3. Every work will then be brought into judgment, will be
enquired into and called over again. It will be a day to bring to
remembrance every thing done in the body. 4. The great thing to be then
judged of concerning every work is whether it be good or evil,
conformable to the will of God or a violation of it. 5. Even secret
things, both good and evil, will be brought to light, and brought to
account, in the judgment of the great day ([Rom
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#016).md); there is no good work, no bad
work, hid, but shall then be made manifest. 6. In consideration of the
judgment to come, and the strictness of that judgment, it highly
concerns us now to be very strict in our walking with God, that we may
give up our account with joy.
