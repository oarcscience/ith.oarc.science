An Exposition, with Practical Observations, of The General Epistle of
James

The writer of this epistle was not James the son of Zebedee; for he was
put to death by Herod (Acts 12) before Christianity had gained so much
ground among the Jews of the dispersion as is here implied. But it was
the other James, the son of Alpheus, who was cousin-german to Christ,
and one of the twelve apostles, [Mat
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#003.md). He is called a pillar ([Gal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009).md), and this epistle of his cannot
be disputed, without loosening a foundation-stone. It is called a
general epistle, because (as some think) not directed to any particular
person or church, but such a one as we call a circular letter. Others
think it is called general, or catholic, to distinguish it from the
epistles of Ignatius, Barnabas, Polycarp, and others who were noted in
the primitive times, but not generally received in the church, and on
that account not canonical, as this is. Eusebius tells us that this
epistle was "generally read in the churches with the other catholic
epistles." His. Eccles. page 53. Ed. Val. Anno 1678. James, our author,
was called the just, for his great piety. He was an eminent example of
those graces which he presses upon others. He was so exceedingly revered
for his justice, temperance, and devotion, that Josephus the Jewish
historian records it as one of the causes of the destruction of
Jerusalem, "That St. James was martyred in it." This is mentioned in
hopes of procuring the greater regard to what is penned by so holy and
excellent a man. The time when this epistle was written is uncertain.
The design of it is to reprove Christians for their great degeneracy
both in faith and manners, and to prevent the spreading of those
libertine doctrines which threatened the destruction of all practical
godliness. It was also a special intention of the author of this epistle
to awaken the Jewish nation to a sense of the greatness and nearness of
those judgments which were coming upon them; and to support all true
Christians in the way of their duty, under the calamities and
persecutions they might meet with. The truths laid down are very
momentous, and necessary to be maintained; and the rules for practice,
as here stated, are such as ought to be observed in our times as well as
in preceding ages.
