### [Matthew Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#001.md)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 22:0</span></span>

This chapter is a continuation of Christ's discourses in the temple, two
or three days before he died. His discourses then are largely recorded,
as being of special weight and consequence. In this chapter, we have, I.
Instruction given, by the parable of the marriage-supper, concerning the
rejection of the Jews, and the calling of the Gentiles ([Mat
22:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#001).md), and, by the doom of the
guest that had not the wedding-garment, the danger of hypocrisy in the
profession of Christianity ([Mat
22:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#011).md). II. Disputes with the
Pharisees, Sadducees, and scribes, who opposed Christ, 1. Concerning
paying tribute to Caesar ([Mat
22:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#015).md). 2. Concerning the
resurrection of the dead, and the future state ([Mat
22:23-33](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#023).md). 3. Concerning the great
commandment of the law ([Mat
22:34-40](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#034).md). 4. Concerning the relation
of the Messiah to David ([Mat
22:41-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#041).md).

[Matthew 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 22:1</span></span>

We have here the parable of the guests invited to the wedding-feast. In
this it is said ([Mat 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#001).md), Jesus
answered, not to what his opposers said (for they were put to silence),
but to what they thought, when they were wishing for an opportunity to
lay hands on him, [Mat 21:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#046.md). Note,
Christ knows how to answer men's thoughts, for he is a Discerner of
them. Or, He answered, that is, he continued his discourse to the same
purport; for this parable represents the gospel offer, and the
entertainment it meets with, as the former, but under another
similitude. The parable of the vineyard represents the sin of the rulers
that persecuted the prophets; it shows also the sin of the people, who
generally neglected the message, while their great ones were persecuting
the messengers.

I. Gospel preparations are here represented by a feast which a king made
at the marriage of his son; such is the kingdom of heaven, such the
provision made for precious souls, in and by the new covenant. The King
is God, a great King, King of kings. Now,

1\. Here is a marriage made for his son, Christ is the Bridegroom, the
church is the bride; the gospel-day is the day of his espousals, [Sol
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#011.md). Behold by faith the church of
the first-born, that are written in heaven, and were given to Christ by
him whose they were; and in them you see the bride, the Lamb's wife,
[Rev 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#009.md). The gospel covenant is a
marriage covenant betwixt Christ and believers, and it is a marriage of
God's making. This branch of the similitude is only mentioned, and not
prosecuted here.

2\. Here is a dinner prepared for this marriage, [Mat
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#004.md). All the privileges of
church-membership, and all the blessings of the new covenant, pardon of
sin, the favour of God, peace of conscience, the promises of the gospel,
and all the riches contained in them, access to the throne of grace, the
comforts of the Spirit, and a well-grounded hope of eternal life. These
are the preparations for this feast, a heaven upon earth now, and a
heaven in heaven shortly. God has prepared it in his counsel, in his
covenant. It is a dinner, denoting present privileges in the midst of
our day, beside the supper at night in glory.

(1.) It is a feast. Gospel preparations were prophesied of as a feast
([Isa 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006).md), a feast of fat things,
and were typified by the many festivals of the ceremonial law ([Co1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#008).md); Let us keep the feast. A feast
is a good day ([Est 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#017).md); so is the
gospel; it is a continual feast. Oxen and fatlings are killed for this
feast; no niceties, but substantial food; enough, and enough of the
best. The day of a feast is a day of slaughter, or sacrifice, [Jam
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#005.md). Gospel preparations are all
founded in the death of Christ, his sacrifice of himself. A feast was
made for love, it is a reconciliation feast, a token of God's goodwill
toward men. It was made for laughter ([Ecc
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#019).md), it is a rejoicing feast. It
was made for fulness; the design of the gospel was to fill every hungry
soul with good things. It was made for fellowship, to maintain an
intercourse between heaven and earth. We are sent for to the banquet of
wine, that we may tell what is our petition, and what is our request.

(2.) It is a wedding feast. Wedding feasts are usually rich, free, and
joyful. The first miracle Christ wrought, was, to make plentiful
provision for a wedding feast ([Joh
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#007).md); and surely then he will not be
wanting in provision for his own wedding feast, when the marriage of the
Lamb is come, and the bride hath made herself ready, a victorious
triumphant feast, [Rev 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007.md), [Rev
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017.md), [Rev
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#018.md).

(3.) It is a royal wedding feast; it is the feast of a king ([Sa1
25:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#036).md), at the marriage, not of a
servant, but of a son; and then, if ever, he will, like Ahasuerus, show
the riches of his glorious kingdom, [Est
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#004.md). The provision made for believers
in the covenant of grace, is not such as worthless worms, like us, had
any reason to expect, but such as it becomes the King of glory to give.
He gives like himself; for he gives himself to be to them El shaddai - a
God that is enough, a feast indeed for a soul.

II\. Gospel calls and offers are represented by an invitation to this
feast. Those that make a feast will have guests to grace the feast with.
God's guests are the children of men. Lord, what is man, that he should
be thus dignified! The guests that were first invited were the Jews;
wherever the gospel is preached, this invitation is given; ministers are
the servants that are sent to invite, ([Pro
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#004.md), [Pro
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#005).md)

Now, 1. The guests are called, bidden to the wedding. All that are
within hearing of the joyful sound of the gospel, to them is the word of
this invitation sent. The servants that bring the invitation do not set
down their names in a paper; there is no occasion for that, since none
are excluded but those that exclude themselves. Those that are bidden to
the dinner are bidden to the wedding; for all that partake of gospel
privileges are to give a due and respectful attendance on the Lord
Jesus, as the faithful friends and humble servants of the Bridegroom.
They are bidden to the wedding, that they may go forth to meet the
bridegroom; for it is the Father's will that all men should honour the
Son.

2\. The guests are called upon; for in the gospel there are not only
gracious proposals made, but gracious persuasives. We persuade men, we
beseech them in Christ's stead, [Co2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#011.md), [Co2
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020.md). See how much Christ's heart is
set upon the happiness of poor souls! He not only provides for them, in
consideration of their want, but sends to them, in consideration of
their weakness and forgetfulness. When the invited guests were slack in
coming, the king sent forth other servants, [Mat
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#004.md). When the prophets of the Old
Testament prevailed not, nor John the Baptist, nor Christ himself, who
told them the entertainment was almost ready (the kingdom of God was at
hand), the apostles and ministers of the gospel were sent after Christ's
resurrection, to tell them it was come, it was quite ready; and to
persuade them to accept the offer. One would think it had been enough to
give men an intimation that they had leave to come, and should be
welcome; that, during the solemnity of the wedding, the king kept open
house; but, because the natural man discerns not, and therefore desires
not, the things of the Spirit of God, we are pressed to accept the call
by the most powerful inducements, drawn with the cords of a man, and all
the bonds of love. If the repetition of the call will move us, Behold,
the Spirit saith, Come; and the bride saith, Come; let him that heareth
say, Come; let him that is athirst come, [Rev
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#017.md). If the reason of the call will
work upon us, Behold, the dinner is prepared, the oxen and fatlings are
killed, and all things are ready; the Father is ready to accept of us,
the Son to intercede for us, the Spirit to sanctify us; pardon is ready;
peace is ready, comfort is ready; the promises are ready, as wells of
living water for supply; ordinances are ready, as golden pipes for
conveyance; angels are ready to attend us, creatures are ready to be in
league with us, providences are ready to work for our good, and heaven,
at last, is ready to receive us; it is a kingdom prepared, ready to be
revealed in the last time. Is all this ready; and shall we be unready?
Is all this preparation made for us; and is there any room to doubt of
our welcome, if we come in a right manner? Come, therefore, O come to
the marriage; we beseech you, receive not all this grace of God in vain,
[Co2 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001.md).

III\. The cold treatment which the gospel of Christ often meets with
among the children of men, represented by the cold treatment that this
message met with and the hot treatment that the messengers met with, in
both which the king himself and the royal bridegroom are affronted. This
reflects primarily upon the Jews, who rejected the counsel of God
against themselves; but it looks further, to the contempt that would, by
many in all ages, be put upon, and the opposition that would be given
to, the gospel of Christ.

1\. The message was basely slighted ([Mat
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#003).md); They would not come. Note, The
reason why sinners come not to Christ and salvation by him is, not
because they cannot, but because they will not ([Joh
5:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#040).md); Ye will not come to me. This
will aggravate the misery of sinners, that they might have had happiness
for the coming for, but it was their own act and deed to refuse it. I
would, and ye would not. But this was not all ([Mat
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#005).md); they made light of it; they
thought it not worth coming for; thought the messengers made more ado
than needs; let them magnify the preparations ever so much, they could
feast as well at home. Note, Making light of Christ, and of the great
salvation wrought out by him, is the damning sin of the world.
Amelēsantes - They were careless. Note, Multitudes perish eternally
through mere carelessness, who have not any direct aversion, but a
prevailing indifference, to the matters of their souls, and an
unconcernedness about them.

And the reason why they made light of the marriage feast was, because
they had other things that they minded more, and had more mind to; they
went their ways, one to his farm, and another to his merchandise. Note,
The business and profit of worldly employments prove to many a great
hindrance in closing with Christ: none turn their back on the feast, but
with some plausible excuse or other, [Luk
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#018.md). The country people have their
farms to look after, about which there is always something or other to
do; the town's people must tend their shops, and be constant upon the
exchange; they must buy, and sell, and get gain. It is true, that both
farmers and merchants must be diligent in their business but not so as
to keep them from making religion their main business. Licitis perimus
omnes - These lawful things undo us, when they are unlawfully managed,
when we are so careful and troubled about many things as to neglect the
one thing needful. Observe, Both the city and the country have their
temptations, the merchandise in the one, and the farms in the other; so
that, whatever we have of the world in our hands, our care must be to
keep it out of our hearts, lest it come between us and Christ.

2\. The messengers were basely abused; The remnant, or the rest of them,
that is, those who did not go the farms, or merchandise, were neither
husbandmen nor tradesmen, but ecclesiastics, the scribes, and Pharisees,
and chief priests; these were the persecutors, these took the servants,
and treated them spitefully, and slew them. This, in the parable, is
unaccountable, never any could be so rude and barbarous as this, to
servants that came to invite them to a feast; but, in the application of
the parable, it was matter of fact; they whose feet should have been
beautiful, because they brought the glad tidings of the solemn feasts
([Nah 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015).md), were treated as the
offscouring of all things, [Co1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#013.md).
The prophets and John the Baptist had been thus abused already, and the
apostles and ministers of Christ must count upon the same. The Jews
were, either directly or indirectly, agents in most of the persecutions
of the first preachers of the gospel; witness the history of the Acts,
that is, the sufferings of the apostles.

IV\. The utter ruin that was coming upon the Jewish church and nation is
here represented by the revenge which the king, in wrath, took on these
insolent recusants ([Mat 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#007).md); He was
wroth. The Jews, who had been the people of God's love and blessing, by
rejecting the gospel became the generation of his wrath and curse. Wrath
came upon them to the uttermost, [Th1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016.md). Now observe here,

1\. What was the crying sin that brought the ruin; it was their being
murderers. He does not say, he destroyed those despisers of his call,
but those murderers of his servants; as if God were more jealous for the
lives of his ministers than for the honour of his gospel; he that
toucheth them, toucheth the apple of his eye. Note, Persecution of
Christ's faithful ministers fills the measure of guilt more than any
thing. Filling Jerusalem with innocent blood was that sin of Manasseh
which the Lord would not pardon, [Kg2
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#004.md).

2\. What was the ruin itself, that was coming; He sent forth his armies.
The Roman armies were his armies, of his raising, of his sending against
the people of his wrath; and he gave them a charge to tread them down,
[Isa 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#006.md). God is the Lord of men's
host, and makes what use he pleases of them, to serve his own purposes,
though they mean not so, neither doth their heart think so, [Isa
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#007.md). See [Mic
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011.md), [Mic
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#012.md). His armies destroyed those
murderers, and burnt up their city. This points out very plainly the
destruction of the Jews, and the burning of Jerusalem, by the Romans,
forty years after this. No age ever saw a greater desolation than that,
nor more of the direful effects of fire and sword. Though Jerusalem had
been a holy city, the city that God had chosen, to put his name there,
beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth; yet that city being
now become a harlot, righteousness being no longer lodged in it, but
murderers, the worst of murderers (as the prophet speaks, [Isa
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#021).md), judgment came upon it, and ruin
without remedy; and it is set forth for an example to all that should
oppose Christ and his gospel. It was the Lord's doing, to avenge the
quarrel of his covenant.

V. The replenishing of the church again, by the bringing in of the
Gentiles, is here represented by the furnishing of the feast with guests
out of the high-ways, [Mat 22:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#008.md).

Here is, 1. The complaint of the master of the feast concerning those
that were first bidden ([Mat 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#008).md),
The wedding is ready, the covenant of grace ready to be sealed, a church
ready to be founded; but they which were bidden, that is, the Jews, to
whom pertained the covenant and the promises, by which they were of old
invited to the feast of fat things, they were not worthy, they were
utterly unworthy, and, by their contempt of Christ, had forfeited all
the privileges they were invited to. Note, It is not owing to God, that
sinners perish, but to themselves. Thus, when Israel of old was within
sight of Canaan, the land of promise was ready, the milk and honey
ready, but their unbelief and murmuring, and contempt of that pleasant
land, shut them out, and their carcases were left to perish in the
wilderness; and these things happened to them for ensamples. See [Co1
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011.md); Heb. 3:16-4:1.

2\. The commission he gave to the servants, to invite other guests. The
inhabitants of the city ([Mat 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#007).md)
had refused; Go into the high-ways then; into the way of the Gentiles,
which at first they were to decline, [Mat
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005.md). Thus by the fall of the Jews
salvation is come to the Gentiles, [Rom
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011.md), [Rom
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012.md); [Eph
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#008.md). Note, Christ will have a kingdom
in the world, though many reject the grace, and resist the power, of
that kingdom. Though Israel be not gathered, he will be glorious. The
offer of Christ and salvation to the Gentiles was, (1.) Unlooked for and
unexpected; such a surprise as it would be to wayfaring men upon the
road to be met with an invitation to a wedding feast. The Jews had
notice of the gospel, long before, and expected the Messiah and his
kingdom; but to the Gentiles it was all new, what they had never heard
of before ([Act 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#019.md), [Act
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#020).md), and, consequently, what they
could not conceive of as belonging to them. See [Isa
65:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001.md), [Isa
65:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#002). (2..md) It was universal and
undistinguishing; Go, and bid as many as you find. The highways are
public places, and there Wisdom cries, [Pro
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020.md). "Ask them that go by the way,
ask any body ([Job 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#029).md), high and
low, rich and poor, bond and free, young and old, Jew and Gentile; tell
them all, that they shall be welcome to gospel-privileges upon
gospel-terms; whoever will, let him come, without exception."

3\. The success of this second invitation; if some will not come, others
will ([Mat 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#010).md); They gathered
together all, as many as they found. The servants obeyed their orders.
Jonah was sent into the high-ways, but was so tender of the honour of
his country, that he avoided the errand; but Christ's apostles, though
Jews, preferred the service of Christ before their respect to their
nation; and St. Paul, though sorrowing for the Jews, yet magnifies his
office as the apostle of Gentiles. They gathered together all. The
design of the gospel is, (1.) To gather souls together; not the nation
of the Jews only, but all the children of God who were scattered abroad
([Joh 11:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#052).md), the other sheep that
were not of that fold, [Joh 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#016.md).
They were gathered into one body, one family, one corporation. (2.) To
gather them together to the wedding-feast, to pay their respect to
Christ, and to partake of the privileges of the new covenant. Where the
dole is, there will the poor be gathered together.

Now the guests that were gathered were, \[1.\] A multitude, all, as many
as they found; so many, that the guest-chamber was filled. The sealed
ones of the Jews were numbered, but those of other nations were without
number, a very great multitude, [Rev
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md). See [Isa
60:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#004.md), [Isa
60:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#008.md). \[2.\] A mixed multitude, both
bad and good; some that before their conversion were sober and
well-inclined, as the devout Greeks ([Act
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#004).md) and Cornelius; others that had
run to an excess of riot, as the Corinthians ([Co1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011).md); Such were some of you; or, some
that after their conversion proved bad, that turned not to the Lord with
all their heart, but feignedly; others that were upright and sincere,
and proved of the right class. Ministers, in casting the net of the
gospel, enclose both good fish and bad; but the Lord knows them that are
his.

VI\. The case of hypocrites, who are in the church, but not of it, who
have a name to live, but are not alive indeed, is represented by the
guest that had not on a wedding garment; one of the bad that were
gathered in. Those come short of salvation by Christ, not only who
refuse to take upon them the profession of religion, but who are not
sound at heart in that profession. Concerning this hypocrite observe,

1\. His discovery, how he was found out, [Mat
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#011.md).

(1.) The king came in to see the guests, to bid those welcome who came
prepared, and to turn those out who came otherwise. Note, The God of
heaven takes particular notice of those who profess religion, and have a
place and name in the visible church. Our Lord Jesus walks among the
golden candlesticks and therefore knows their works. See [Rev
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#001.md), [Rev
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#002.md); [Sol
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#012.md). Let this be a warning to us
against hypocrisy, that disguises will shortly be stripped off, and
every man will appear in his own colours; and an encouragement to us in
our sincerity, that God is a witness to it.

Observe, This hypocrite was never discovered to be without a wedding
garment, till the king himself came in to see the guests. Note, It is
God's prerogative to know who are sound at heart in their profession,
and who are not. We may be deceived in men, either one way or other; but
He cannot. The day of judgment will be the great discovering day, when
all the guests will be presented to the King: then he will separate
between the precious and the vile ([Mat
25:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#032).md), the secrets of all hearts will
then be made manifest, and we shall infallibly discern between the
righteous and the wicked, which now it is not easy to do. It concerns
all the guests, to prepare for the scrutiny, and to consider how they
will pass the piercing eye of the heart-searching God.

(2.) As soon as he came in, he presently espied the hypocrite; He saw
there a man which had not on a wedding garment; though but one, he soon
had his eye upon him; there is no hope of being hid in a crowd from the
arrests of divine justice; he had not on a wedding garment; he was not
dressed as became a nuptial solemnity; he had not his best clothes on.
Note, Many come to the wedding feast without a wedding garment. If the
gospel be the wedding feast, then the wedding garment is a frame of
heart, and a course of life agreeable to the gospel and our profession
of it, worthy of the vocation wherewith we are called ([Eph
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001).md), as becomes the gospel of Christ,
[Phi 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027.md). The righteousness of
saints, their real holiness and sanctification, and Christ, made
Righteousness to them, is the clean linen, [Rev
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008.md). This man was not naked, or in
rags; some raiment he had, but not a wedding garment. Those, and those
only, who put on the Lord Jesus, that have a Christian temper of mind,
and are adorned with Christian graces, who live by faith in Christ, and
to whom he is all in all, have the wedding garment.

2\. His trial ([Mat 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#012).md); and here
we may observe,

(1.) How he was arraigned ([Mat
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#012).md); Friend, how camest thou in
hither, not having a wedding garment? A startling question to one that
was priding himself in the place he securely possessed at the feast.
Friend! That was a cutting word; a seeming friend, a pretended friend, a
friend in profession, under manifold ties and obligations to be a
friend. Note, There are many in the church who are false friends to
Jesus Christ, who say that they love him while their hearts are not with
him. How camest thou in hither? He does not chide the servants for
letting him in (the wedding garment is an inward thing, ministers must
go according to that which falls within their cognizance); but he checks
his presumption in crowding in, when he knew that his heart was not
upright; "How durst thou claim a share in gospel benefits, when tho
hadst no regard to gospel rules? What has thou to do to declare my
statutes?" [Psa 50:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016.md), [Psa
50:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#017.md) Such are spots in the feast,
dishonour the bridegroom, affront the company, and disgrace themselves;
and therefore, How camest thou in hither? Note, The day is coming, when
hypocrites will be called to an account for all their presumptuous
intrusion into gospel ordinances, and usurpation of gospel privileges.
Who hath required this at your hand? [Isa
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#012.md). Despised sabbaths and abused
sacraments must be reckoned for, and judgment taken out upon an action
of waste against all those who received the grace of God in vain. "How
camest thou to the Lord's table, at such a time, unhumbled and
unsanctified? What brought thee to sit before God's prophets, as his
people do, when thy heart went after thy covetousness? How cames thou
in? Not by the door, but some other way, as a thief and a robber. It was
a tortuous entry, a possession without colour of a title." Note, It is
good for those that have a place in the church, often to put it to
themselves, "How came I in hither? Have I a wedding-garment?" If we
would thus judge ourselves, we should not be judged.

(2.) How he was convicted; he was speechless: ephimōthē - he was muzzled
(so the word is used, [Co1 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009).md); the
man stood mute, upon his arraignment, being convicted and condemned by
his own conscience. They who live within the church, and die without
Christ, will not have one word to say for themselves in the judgment of
the great day, they will be without excuse; should they plead, We have
eaten and drunk in thy presence, as they do, [Luk
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#026.md), that is to plead guilty; for
the crime they are charged with, is thrusting themselves into the
presence of Christ, and to his table, before they were called. They who
never heard a word of this wedding feast will have more to say for
themselves; their sin will be more excusable, and their condemnation
more tolerable, than theirs who came to the feast without the wedding
garment, and so sin against the clearest light and dearest love.

3\. His sentence ([Mat 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#013).md); Bind
him hand and foot, etc.

(1.) He is ordered to be pinioned, as condemned malefactors are, to be
manacled and shackled. Those that will not work and walk as they should,
may expect to be bound hand and foot. There is a binding in this world
by the servants, the ministers, whose suspending of persons that walk
disorderly, to the scandal of religion, is called binding of them, [Mat
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#018.md). "Bind them up from partaking of
special ordinances, and the peculiar privileges of their
church-membership; bind them over to the righteous judgment of god." In
the day of judgment, hypocrites will be bound; the angels shall bind up
these tares in bundles for the fire, [Mat
13:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#041.md). Damned sinners are bound hand
and foot by an irreversible sentence; this signifies the same with the
fixing of the great gulf; they can neither resist nor outrun their
punishment.

(2.) He is ordered to be carried off from the wedding feast; Take him
away. When the wickedness of hypocrites appears, they are to be taken
away from the communion of the faithful, to be cut of as withered
branches. This bespeaks the punishment of loss in the other world; they
shall be taken away from the king, from the kingdom, from the wedding
feast, Depart from me, ye cursed. It will aggravate their misery, that
(like the unbelieving lord, [Kg2 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#002).md),
they shall see all this plenty with their eyes, but shall not taste of
it. Note, Those that walk unworthy of their Christianity, forfeit all
the happiness they presumptuously laid claim to, and complimented
themselves with a groundless expectation of.

(3.) He is ordered into a doleful dungeon; Cast him into utter darkness.
Our Saviour here insensibly slides out of this parable into that which
it intimates - the damnation of hypocrites in the other world. Hell is
utter darkness, it is darkness out of heaven, the land of light; or it
is extreme darkness, darkness to the last degree, without the least ray
or spark of light, or hope of it, like that of Egypt; darkness which
might be felt; the blackness of darkness, as darkness itself, [Job
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#022.md). Note, Hypocrites go by the
light of the gospel itself down to utter darkness; and hell will be hell
indeed to such, a condemnation more intolerable; there shall be weeping,
and gnashing of teeth. This our Saviour often uses as part of the
description of hell-torments, which are hereby represented, not so much
by the misery itself, as by the resentment sinners will have of it;
there shall be weeping, an expression of great sorrow and anguish; not a
gush of tears, which gives present ease, but constant weeping, which is
constant torment; and the gnashing of teeth is an expression of the
greatest rage and indignation; they will be like a wild bull in a net,
full of the fury of the Lord, [Isa
51:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#020.md); [Isa
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#021.md), [Isa
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#022.md). Let us therefore hear and fear.

Lastly, The parable is concluded with that remarkable saying which we
had before ([Mat 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#016).md), Many are
called, but few are chosen, [Mat
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#014.md). Of the many that are called to
the wedding feast, if you set aside all those as unchosen that make
light of it, and avowedly prefer other things before it; if then you set
aside all that make a profession of religion, but the temper of whose
spirits and the tenour of whose conversation are a constant
contradiction to it; if you set aside all the profane, and all the
hypocritical, you will find that they are few, very few, that are
chosen; many called to the wedding feast, but few chosen to the wedding
garment, that is, to salvation, by sanctification of the Spirit. This is
the strait gate, and narrow way, which few find.

[Matthew 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 22:15</span></span>

It was not the least grievous of the sufferings of Christ, that he
endured the contradiction of sinners against himself, and had snares
laid for him by those that sought how to take him off with some
pretence. In these verses, we have him attacked by the Pharisees and
Herodians with a question about paying tribute to Caesar. Observe,

I. What the design was, which they proposed to themselves; They took
counsel to entangle him in his talk. Hitherto, his encounters had been
mostly with the chief priests and the elders, men in authority, who
trusted more to their power than to their policy, and examined him
concerning his commission ([Mat
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#023).md); but now he is set upon from
another quarter; the Pharisees will try whether they can deal with him
by their learning in the law, and in casuistical divinity, and they have
a tentamen novum - a new trial for him. Note, It is in vain for the best
and wisest of men to think that, by their ingenuity, or interest, or
industry, or even by their innocence and integrity, they can escape the
hatred and ill will of bad men, or screen themselves from the strife of
tongues. See how unwearied the enemies of Christ and his kingdom are in
their opposition!

1\. They took counsel. It was foretold concerning him, that the rulers
would take counsel against him ([Psa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#002).md); and so persecuted they the
prophets. Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah. See [Jer
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018.md); [Jer
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#010.md). Note, The more there is of
contrivance and consultation about sin, the worse it is. There is a
particular woe to them that devise iniquity, [Mic
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md). The more there is of the wicked
wit in the contrivance of a sin, the more there is of the wicked will in
the commission of it.

2\. That which they aimed at was to entangle him in his talk. They saw
him free and bold in speaking his mind, and hoped by that, if they could
bring him to some nice and tender point, to get an advantage against
him. It has been the old practice of Satan's agents and emissaries, to
make a man an offender for a word, a word misplaced, or mistaken, or
misunderstood; a word, though innocently designed, yet perverted by
strained inuendos: thus they lay a snare for him that reproveth in the
gate ([Isa 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#021).md), and represent the
greatest teachers as the greatest troublers of Israel: thus the wicked
plotteth against the just, [Psa 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#012.md),
[Psa 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#013.md).

There are two ways by which the enemies of Christ might be revenged on
him, and be rid of him; either by law or by force. By law they could not
do it, unless they could make him obnoxious to the civil government; for
it was not lawful for them to put any man to death ([Joh
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#031).md); and the Roman powers were not
apt to concern themselves about questions of words, and names, and their
law, [Act 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#015.md). By force they could
not do it, unless they could make him obnoxious to the people, who were
always the hands, whoever were the heads, in such acts of violence,
which they call the beating of the rebels; but the people took Christ
for a Prophet, and therefore his enemies could not raise the mob against
him. Now (as the old serpent was from the beginning more subtle than any
beast of the field), the design was, to bring him into such a dilemma,
that he must make himself liable to the displeasure either of the Jewish
multitude, or of the Roman magistrates; let him take which side of the
question he will, he shall run himself into a premunire; and so they
will gain their point, and make his own tongue to fall upon him.

II\. The question which they put to him pursuant to this design, [Mat
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#016.md), [Mat
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#017.md). Having devised this iniquity in
secret, in a close cabal, behind the curtain, when they went abroad
without loss of time they practised it. Observe,

1\. The persons they employed; they did not go themselves, lest the
design should be suspected and Christ should stand the more upon his
guard; but they sent their disciples, who would look less like tempters,
and more like learners. Note, Wicked men will never want wicked
instruments to be employed in carrying on their wicked counsels.
Pharisees have their disciples at their beck, who will go any errand for
them, and say as they say; and they have this in their eyes, when they
are so industrious to make proselytes.

With them they sent the Herodians, a party among the Jews, who were for
a cheerful and entire subjection to the Roman emperor, and to Herod his
deputy; and who made it their business to reconcile people to that
government, and pressed all to pay their tribute. Some think that they
were the collectors of the land tax, as the publicans were of the
customs, and that they went with the Pharisees to Christ, with this
blind upon their plot, that while the Herodians demanded the tax, and
the Pharisees denied it, they were both willing to refer it to Christ,
as a proper Judge to decide the quarrel. Herod being obliged, by the
charter of the sovereignty, to take care of the tribute, these
Herodians, by assisting him in that, helped to endear him to his great
friends at Rome. The Pharisees, on the other hand, were zealous for the
liberty of the Jews, and did what they could to make them impatient of
the Roman yoke. Now, if he should countenance the paying of tribute, the
Pharisees would incense the people against him; if he should
discountenance or disallow it, the Herodians would incense the
government against him. Note, It is common for those that oppose one
another, to continue in an opposition to Christ and his kingdom.
Samson's foxes looked several ways, but met in one firebrand. See [Psa
83:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#003.md), [Psa
83:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#005.md), [Psa
83:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#007.md), [Psa
83:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#008.md). If they are unanimous in
opposing, should not we be so in maintaining, the interests of the
gospel?

2\. The preface, with which they were plausibly to introduce the
question; it was highly complimentary to our Saviour ([Mat
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#016).md); Master, we know that thou art
true, and teachest the way of God in truth. Note, It is a common thing
for the most spiteful projects to be covered with the most specious
pretences. Had they come to Christ with the most serious enquiry, and
the most sincere intention, they could not have expressed themselves
better. Here is hatred covered with deceit, and a wicked heart with
burning lips ([Pro 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#023).md); as Judas,
who kissed, and betrayed, as Joab, who kissed, and killed.

Now, (1.) What they said of Christ was right, and whether they knew it
or no, blessed be God, we know it.

\[1.\] That Jesus Christ was a faithful Teacher; Thou art true, and
teachest the way of God in truth. For himself, he is true, the Amen, the
faithful Witness; he is the Truth itself. As for his doctrine, the
matter of his teaching was the way of God, the way that God requires us
to walk in, the way of duty, that leads to happiness; that is the way of
God. The manner of it was in truth; he showed people the right way, the
way in which they should go. He was a skilful Teacher, and knew the way
of God; and a faithful Teacher, that would be sure to let us know it.
See [Pro 8:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#006.md). This is the character
of a good teacher, to preach the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth, and not to suppress, pervert, or stretch, any truth, for
favour or affection, hatred or good will, either out of a desire to
please, or a fear to offend, any man.

\[2.\] That he was a bold Reprover. In preaching, he cared not for any;
he valued no man's frowns or smiles, he did not court, he did not dread,
either the great or the many, for he regarded not the person of man. In
his evangelical judgment, he did not know faces; that Lion of the tribe
of Judah, turned not away for any ([Pro
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#030).md), turned not a step from the
truth, nor from his work, for fear of the most formidable. He reproved
with equity ([Isa 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004).md), and never
with partiality.

(2.) Though what they said was true for the matter of it, yet there was
nothing but flattery and treachery in the intention of it. They called
him Master, when they were contriving to treat him as the worst of
malefactors; they pretended respect for him, when they intended mischief
against him; and they affronted his wisdom as Man, much more his
omniscience as God, of which he had so often given undeniable proofs,
when they imagined that they could impose upon him with these pretences,
and that he could not see through them. It is the grossest atheism, that
is the greatest folly in the world, to think to put a cheat upon Christ,
who searches the heart, [Rev 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#023.md).
Those that mock God do but deceive themselves. [Gal
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007.md).

3\. The proposal of the case; What thinkest thou? As if they had said,
"Many men are of many minds in this matter; it is a case which relates
to practice, and occurs daily; let us have thy thought freely in the
matter, Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not?" This implies a
further question; Has Caesar a right to demand it? The nation of the
Jews was lately, about a hundred years before this, conquered by the
Roman sword, and so, as other nations, made subject to the Roman yoke,
and became a province of the empire; accordingly, toll, tribute, and
custom, were demanded from them, and sometimes poll-money. By this it
appeared that the sceptre was departed from Judah ([Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010).md); and therefore, if they had
understood the signs of the times, they must have concluded that Shiloh
was come, and either that this was he, or they must find out another
more likely to be so.

Now the question was, Whether it was lawful to pay these taxes
voluntarily, or, Whether they should not insist upon the ancient liberty
of their nation, and rather suffer themselves to be distrained upon? The
ground of the doubt was, that they were Abraham's seed, and should not
by consent be in bondage to any man, [Joh
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#033.md). God had given them a law, that
they should not set a stranger over them. Did not that imply, that they
were not to yield any willing subjection to any prince, state, or
potentate, that was not of their own nation and religion? This was an
old mistake, arising from that pride and thathaughty spirit which bring
destruction and a fall. Jeremiah, in his time, though he spoke in God's
name, could not possibly beat them off it, nor persuade them to submit
to the king of Babylon; and their obstinacy in that matter was then
their ruin ([Jer 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#012.md), [Jer
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#013).md): and now again they stumbled at
the same stone; and it was the very thing which, in a few years after,
brought final destruction upon them by the Romans. They quite mistook
the sense both of the precept and of the privilege, and, under colour of
God's word, contended with his providence, when they should have kissed
the rod, and accepted the punishment of their iniquity.

However, by this question they hoped to entangle Christ, and, which way
soever he resolved it, to expose him to the fury either of the jealous
Jews, or of the jealous Romans; they were ready to triumph, as Pharaoh
did over Israel, that the wilderness had shut him in, and his doctrine
would be concluded either injurious to the rights of the church, or
hurtful to kings and provinces.

III\. The breaking of this snare by the wisdom of the Lord Jesus.

1\. He discovered it ([Mat 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#018).md); He
perceived their wickedness; for, surely in vain is the net spread in the
sight of any bird, [Pro 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#017.md). A
temptation perceived is half conquered, for our greatest danger lies
from snakes under the green grass; and he said, Why tempt ye me, ye
hypocrites? Note, Whatever vizard the hypocrite puts on, our Lord Jesus
sees through it; he perceives all the wickedness that is in the hearts
of pretenders, and can easily convict them of it, and set it in order
before them. He cannot be imposed upon, as we often are, by flatteries
and fair pretences. He that searches the heart can call hypocrites by
their own name, as Ahijah did the wife of Jeroboam ([Kg1
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#006).md), Why feignest thou thyself to be
another? Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? Note, Hypocrites tempt Jesus
Christ; they try his knowledge, whether he can discover them through
their disguises; they try his holiness and truth, whether he will allow
of them in this church; but if they that of old tempted Christ, when he
was but darkly revealed, were destroyed of serpents, of how much sorer
punishment shall they be thought worthy who tempt him now in the midst
of gospel light and love! Those that presume to tempt Christ will
certainly find him too hard for them, and that he is of more piercing
eyes than not to see, and more pure eyes than not to hate, the disguised
wickedness of hypocrites, that dig deep to hide their counsel from him.

2\. He evaded it; his convicting them of hypocrisy might have served for
an answer (such captious malicious questions deserve a reproof, not a
reply): but our Lord Jesus gave a full answer to their question, and
introduced it by an argument sufficient to support it, so as to lay down
a rule for his church in this matter, and yet to avoid giving offence,
and to break the snare.

(1.) He forced them, ere they were aware, to confess Caesar's authority
over them, [Mat 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#019.md), [Mat
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#020.md). In dealing with those that are
captious, it is good to give our reasons, and, if possible, reasons of
confessed cogency, before we give our resolutions. Thus the evidence of
truth may silence gainsayers by surprise, while they only stood upon
their guard against the truth itself, not against the reason of it; Show
me the tribute-money. He had none of his own to convince them by; it
should seem, he had not so much as one piece of money about him, for for
our sakes he emptied himself, and became poor; he despised the wealth of
this world, and thereby taught us not to over-value it; silver and gold
he had none; why then should we covet to load ourselves with the thick
clay? The Romans demanded their tribute in their own money, which was
current among the Jews at that time: that therefore is called the
tribute-money; he does not name what piece but the tribute money, to
show that he did not mind things of that nature, nor concern himself
about them; his heart was upon better things, the kingdom of God and the
riches and righteousness thereof, and ours should be so too. They
presently brought him a penny, a Roman penny in silver, in value about
sevenpence half-penny of our money, the most common piece then in use:
it was stamped with the emperor's image and superscription, which was
the warrant of the public faith for the value of the pieces so stamped;
a method agreed on by most nations, for the more easy circulation of
money with satisfaction. The coining of money has always been looked
upon as a branch of the prerogative, a flower of the crown, a royalty
belonging to the sovereign powers; and the admitting of that as the good
and lawful money of a country is an implicit submission to those powers,
and an owning of them in money matters. How happy is our constitution,
and how happy we, who live in a nation where, though the image and
superscription be the sovereign's, the property is the subject's, under
the protection of the laws, and what we have we can call our own!

Christ asked them, Whose image is this? They owned it to be Caesar's,
and thereby convicted those of falsehood who said, We were never in
bondage to any; and confirmed what afterward they said, We have no king
but Caesar. It is a rule in the Jewish Talmud, that "he is the king of
the country whose coin is current in the country." Some think that the
superscription upon this coin was a memorandum of the conquest of Judea
by the Romans, anno post captam Judaeam - the year after that event; and
that they admitted that too.

(2.) From thence he inferred the lawfulness of paying tribute to Caesar
([Mat 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#021).md); Render therefore to
Caesar the things that are Caesar's; not, "Give it him" (as they
expressed it, [Mat 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#017).md), but,
"Render it; Return," or "Restore it; if Caesar fill the purses, let
Caesar command them. It is too late now to dispute paying tribute to
Caesar; for you are become a province of the empire, and, when once a
relation is admitted, the duty of it must be performed. Render to all
their due, and particularly tribute to whom tribute is due." Now by this
answer,

\[1.\] No offence was given. It was much to the honour of Christ and his
doctrine, that he did not interpose as a Judge or a Divider in matters
of this nature, but left them as he found them, for his kingdom is not
of this world; and in this he hath given an example to his ministers,
who deal in sacred things, not to meddle with disputes about things
secular, not to wade far into controversies relating to them, but to
leave that to those whose proper business it is. Ministers that would
mind their business, and please their master, must not entangle
themselves in the affairs of this life: they forfeit the guidance of
God's Spirit, and the convoy of his providence when they thus to out of
their way. Christ discusses not the emperor's title, but enjoins a
peaceable subjection to the powers that be. The government therefore had
no reason to take offence at his determination, but to thank him, for it
would strengthen Caesar's interest with the people, who held him for a
Prophet; and yet such was the impudence of his prosecutors, that, though
he had expressly charged them to render to Caesar the things that are
Caesar's, they laid the direct contrary in his indictment, that he
forbade to give tribute to Caesar, [Luk
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#002.md). As to the people, the Pharisees
could not accuse him to them, because they themselves had, before they
were aware, yielded the premises, and then it was too late to evade the
conclusion. Note, Though truth seeks not a fraudulent concealment, yet
it sometimes needs a prudent management, to prevent the offence which
may be taken at it.

\[2.\] His adversaries were reproved. First, Some of them would have had
him make it unlawful to give tribute to Caesar, that they might have a
pretence to save their money. Thus many excuse themselves from that
which they must do, by arguing whether they may do it or no. Secondly,
They all withheld from God his dues, and are reproved for that: while
they were vainly contending about their civil liberties, they had lost
the life and power of religion, and needed to be put in mind of their
duty to God, with that to Caesar.

\[3.\] His disciples were instructed, and standing rules left to the
church.

First, That the Christian religion is no enemy to civil government, but
a friend to it. Christ's kingdom doth not clash or interfere with the
kingdoms of the earth, in any thing that pertains to their jurisdiction.
By Christ kings reign.

Secondly, It is the duty of subjects to render to magistrates that
which, according to the laws of their country, is their due. The higher
powers, being entrusted with the public welfare, the protection of the
subject, and the conservation of the peace, are entitled, in
consideration thereof, to a just proportion of the public wealth, and
the revenue of the nation. For this cause pay we tribute, because they
attend continually to this very thing ([Rom
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#006).md); and it is doubtless a greater
sin to cheat the government than to cheat a private person. Though it is
the constitution that determines what is Caesar's, yet, when that is
determined, Christ bids us render it to him; my coat is my coat, by the
law of man; but he is a thief, by the law of God, that takes it from me.

Thirdly, When we render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, we must
remember withal to render to God the things that are God's. If our
purses be Caesar's, our consciences are God's; he hath said, My son,
give me thy heart: he must have the innermost and uppermost place there;
we must render to God that which is his due, out of our time and out of
our estates; from them he must have his share as well as Caesar his; and
if Caesar's commands interfere with God's we must obey God rather than
men.

Lastly, Observe how they were nonplussed by this answer; they marvelled,
and left him, and went their way, [Mat
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#022.md). They admired his sagacity in
discovering and evading a snare which they thought so craftily laid.
Christ is, and will be, the Wonder, not only of his beloved friends, but
of his baffled enemies. One would think they should have marvelled and
followed him, marvelled and submitted to him; no, they marvelled and
left him. Note, There are many in whose eyes Christ is marvellous, and
yet not precious. They admire his wisdom, but will not be guided by it,
his power, but will not submit to it. They went their way, as persons
ashamed, and made an inglorious retreat. The stratagem being defeated,
they quitted the field. Note, There is nothing got by contending with
Christ.

[Matthew 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 22:23</span></span>

We have here Christ's dispute with the Sadducees concerning the
resurrection; it was the same day on which he was attacked by the
Pharisees about paying tribute. Satan was now more busy than ever to
ruffle and disturb him; it was an hour of temptation, [Rev
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#010.md). The truth as it is in Jesus will
still meet with contradiction, in some branch or other of it. Observe
here,

I. The opposition which the Sadducees made to a very great truth of
religion; they say, There is no resurrection, as there are some fools
who say, There is no God. These heretics were called Sadducees from one
Sadoc, a disciple of Antigonus Sochaeus, who flourished about two
hundred and eighty-four years before our Saviour's birth. They lie under
heavy censures among the writers of their own nation, as men of base and
debauched conversations, which their principles led them to. They were
the fewest in number of all the sects among the Jews, but generally
persons of some rank. As the Pharisees and Essenes seemed to follow
Plato and Pythagoras, so the Sadducees were much of the genius of the
Epicureans; they denied the resurrection, they said, There is no future
state, no life after this; that, when the body dies, the soul is
annihilated, and dies with it; that there is no state of rewards or
punishments in the other world; no judgment to come in heaven or hell.
They maintained, that, except God, there is not spirit ([Act
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#008).md), nothing but matter and motion.
They would not own the divine inspiration of the prophets, nor any
revelation from heaven, but what God himself spoke upon mount Sinai. Now
the doctrine of Christ carried that great truth of the resurrection and
a future state much further than it had yet been revealed, and therefore
the Sadducees in a particular manner set themselves against it. The
Pharisees and Sadducees were contrary to each other, and yet
confederates against Christ. Christ's gospel hath always suffered
between superstitious ceremonious hypocrites and bigots on the one hand,
and profane deists and infidels on the other. The former abusing, the
latter despising, the form of godliness, but both denying the power of
it.

II\. The objection they made against the truth, which was taken from a
supposed case of a woman that had seven husbands successively; now they
take it for granted, that, if there be a resurrection, it must be a
return to such a state as this we are now in, and to the same
circumstances, like the imaginary Platonic year; and if so, it is an
invincible absurdity for this woman in the future state to have seven
husbands, or else an insuperable difficulty which of them should have
her, he whom she had first, or he whom she had last, or he whom she
loved best, or he whom she lived longest with.

1\. They suggest the law of Moses in this matter ([Mat
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#024).md), that the next of kin should
marry the widow of him that died childless ([Deu
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005).md); we have it practised [Rut
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#005.md). It was a political law, founded
in the particular constitution of the Jewish commonwealth, to preserve
the distinction of families and inheritances, of both which there was
special care taken in that government.

2\. They put a case upon this statute, which, whether it were a case in
fact or only a moot case, is not at all material; if it had not really
occurred, yet possibly it might. It was of seven brothers, who married
the same woman, [Mat 22:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#025.md). Now
this case supposes,

(1.) The desolations that death sometimes makes in families when it
comes with commission; how it often sweeps away a whole fraternity in a
little time;: seldom (as the case is put) according to seniority (the
land of darkness is without any order,) but heaps upon heaps; it
diminishes families that had multiplied greatly, [Psa
107:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#038.md), [Psa
107:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#039.md). When there were seven brothers
grown up to man's estate, there was a family very likely to be built up;
and yet this numerous family leaves neither son nor nephew, nor any
remaining in their dwellings, [Job
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#019.md). Well may we say then, Except
the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it. Let none be
sure of the advancement and perpetuity of their names and families,
unless they could make a covenant of peace with death, or be at an
agreement with the grave.

(2.) The obedience of these seven brothers to the law, though they had a
power of refusal under the penalty of a reproach, [Deu
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#007.md). Note, Discouraging providences
should not keep us from doing our duty because we must be governed by
the rule, not by the event. The seventh, who ventured last to marry the
widow (many a one would say) was a bold man. I would say, if he did it
purely in obedience to God, he was a good man, and one that made
conscience of his duty.

But, last of all, the woman died also. Note, Survivorship is but a
reprieve; they that live long, and bury their relations and neighbours
one after another, do not thereby acquire an immortality; no, their day
will come to fall. Death's bitter cup goes round, and, sooner or later,
we must all pledge in it, [Jer 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026.md).

3\. They propose a doubt upon this case ([Mat
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#028).md); "In the resurrection, whose
wife shall she be of the seven? You cannot tell whose; and therefore we
must conclude there is no resurrection." The Pharisees, who professed to
believe a resurrection, had very gross and carnal notions concerning it,
and concerning the future state; expecting to find there, as the Turks
in their paradise, the delights and pleasures of the animal life, which
perhaps drove the Sadducees to deny the thing itself; for nothing gives
greater advantage to atheism and infidelity than the carnality of those
that make religion, either in its professions or in its prospects, a
servant to their sensual appetites and secular interests; while those
that are erroneous deny the truth, those that are superstitious betray
it to them. Now they, in this objection, went upon the Pharisees'
hypothesis. Note, It is not strange that carnal minds have very false
notions of spiritual and eternal things. The natural man receiveth not
these things, for they are foolishness to him. [Co1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014.md). Let truth be set in a clear
light, and then it appears in its full strength.

III\. Christ's answer to this objection; by reproving their ignorance,
and rectifying their mistake, he shows the objection to be fallacious
and unconcluding.

1\. He reproves their ignorance ([Mat
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#029).md); Ye do err. Note, Those do
greatly err, in the judgment of Christ, who deny the resurrection and a
future state. Here Christ reproves with the meekness of wisdom, and is
not so sharp upon them (whatever was the reason) as sometimes he was
upon the chief priests and elders; Ye do err, not knowing. Note,
Ignorance is the cause of error; those that are in the dark, miss their
way. The patrons of error do therefore resist the light, and do what
they can to take away the key of knowledge; Ye do err in this matter,
not knowing. Note, Ignorance is the cause of error about the
resurrection and the future state. What it is in its particular
instances, the wisest and best know not; it doth not yet appear what we
shall be, it is a glory that is to be revealed: when we speak of the
state of separate souls, the resurrection of the body, and of eternal
happiness and misery, we are soon at a loss; we cannot order our speech,
by reason of darkness, but that it is a thing about which we are not
left in the dark; blessed be God, we are not; and those who deny it are
guilty of a willing and affected ignorance. It seems, there were some
Sadducees, some such monsters, among professing Christians, some among
you, that say, There is no resurrection of the dead ([Co1
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#012).md) and some that did in effect
deny it, by turning it into an allegory, saying, The resurrection is
past already. Now observe,

(1.) They know not the power of God; which would lead men to infer that
there may be a resurrection and a future state. Note, The ignorance,
disbelief, or weak belief, of God's power, is at the bottom of many
errors, particularly theirs who deny the resurrection. When we are told
of the soul's existence and agency in a state of separation from the
body, and especially that a dead body, which had lain many ages in the
grave, and is turned into common and indistinguished dust, that this
shall be raised the same body that it was, and live, move, and act,
again; we are ready to say, How can these things be? Nature allows it
for a maxim, A privatione ad habitum non datur regressus - The habits
attaching to a state of existence vanish irrecoverably with the state
itself. If a man die, shall he live again? And vain men, because they
cannot comprehend the way of it, question the truth of it; whereas, if
we firmly believe in God the Father Almighty, that nothing is impossible
with God, all these difficulties vanish. This therefore we must fasten
upon, in the first place, that God is omnipotent, and can do what he
will; and then no room is left for doubting but that he will do what he
has promised; and, if so, why should it be thought a thing incredible
with you that God should raise the dead? [Act
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#008.md). His power far exceeds the power
of nature.

(2.) They know not the scriptures, which decidedly affirm that there
shall be a resurrection and a future state. The power of God, determined
and engaged by his promise, is the foundation for faith to build upon.
Now the scriptures speak plainly, that the soul is immortal, and there
is another life after this; it is the scope both of the law and of the
prophets, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the
just and of the unjust, [Act 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#014.md),
[Act 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#015.md). Job knew it ([Job
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#026)), Ezekiel foresaw it (Eze. 37.md),
and Daniel plainly foretold it, [Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md). Christ rose again according to
the scriptures ([Co1 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#003).md); and so
shall we. Those therefore who deny it, either have not conversed with
the Scriptures, or do not believe them, or do not take the true sense
and meaning of them. Note, Ignorance of the scripture is the rise of
abundance of mischief.

2\. He rectifies their mistake, and ([Mat
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#030).md) corrects those gross ideas
which they had of the resurrection and a future state, and fixes these
doctrines upon a true and lasting basis. Concerning that state, observe,

(1.) It is not like the state we are now in upon earth; They neither
marry, nor are given in marriage. In our present state marriage is
necessary; it was instituted in innocency; whatever intermission or
neglect there has been of other institutions, this was never laid aside,
nor will be till the end of time. In the old world, they were marrying,
and giving in marriage; the Jews in Babylon, when cut off from other
ordinances, yet were bid to take them wives, [Jer
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#006.md). All civilized nations have had a
sense of the obligation of the marriage covenant; and it is requisite
for the gratifying of the desires, and recruiting the deficiencies, of
the human nature. But, in the resurrection, there is no occasion for
marriage; whether in glorified bodies there will be any distinction of
sexes some too curiously dispute (the ancients are divided in their
opinions about it); but, whether there will be a distinction or not, it
is certain that there will be no conjunction; where God will be all in
all, there needs no other meet-help; the body will be spiritual, and
there will be in it no carnal desires to be gratified: when the mystical
body is completed, there will be no further occasion to seek a godly
seed, which was one end of the institution of marriage, [Mal
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#015.md). In heaven there will be no decay
of the individuals, and therefore no eating and drinking; no decay of
the species, and therefore no marrying; where there shall be no more
deaths ([Rev 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004).md), there need be no
more births. The married state is a composition of joys and cares; those
that enter upon it are taught to look upon it as subject to changes,
richer and poorer, sickness and health; and therefore it is fit for this
mixed, changing world; but as in hell, where there is no joy, the voice
of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride shall be heard no more at
all, so in heaven, where there is all joy, and no care or pain or
trouble, there will be no marrying. The joys of that state are pure and
spiritual, and arise from the marriage of all of them to the Lamb, not
of any of them to one another.

(2.) It is like the state angels are now in in heaven; They are as the
angels of God in heaven; they are so, that is, undoubtedly they shall be
so. They are so already in Christ their Head, who has made them sit with
him in heavenly places, [Eph 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006.md). The
spirits of just men already made perfect are of the same corporation
with the innumerable company of angels, [Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022.md), [Heb
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023.md). Man in his creation was made a
little lower than the angels ([Psa
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005).md); but in his complete redemption
and renovation will be as the angels; pure and spiritual as the angels,
knowing and loving as those blessed seraphim, ever praising God like
them and with them. The bodies of the saints shall be raised
incorruptible and glorious, like the uncompounded vehicles of those pure
and holy spirits ([Co1 15:42](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#042), etc..md),
swift and strong, like them. We should therefore desire and endeavour to
do the will of God now as the angels do it in heaven, because we hope
shortly to be like the angels who always behold our Father's face. He
saith nothing of the state of the wicked in the resurrection; but, by
consequence, they shall be like the devils, whose lusts they have done.

IV\. Christ's argument to confirm this great truth of the resurrection
and a future state; the matters being of great concern, he did not think
it enough (as in some other disputes) to discover the fallacy and
sophistry of the objection, but backed the truth with a solid argument;
for Christ brings forth judgment to truth as well as victory, and
enables his followers to give a reason of the hope that is in them. Now
observe,

1\. Whence he fetched his argument - from the scripture; that is the
great magazine or armoury whence we may be furnished with spiritual
weapons, offensive and defensive. It is written is Goliath's sword. Have
ye not read that which was spoken to you by God? Note, (1.) What the
scripture speaks God speaks. (2.) What was spoken to Moses was spoken to
us; it was spoken and written for our learning. (3.) It concerns us to
read and hear what God hath spoken, because it is spoken to us. It was
spoken to you Jews in the first place, for to them were committed the
oracles of God. The argument is fetched from the books of Moses, because
the Sadducees received them only, as some think, or, at least, them
chiefly, for canonical scriptures; Christ therefore fetched his proof
from the most indisputable fountain. The latter prophets have more
express proofs of a future state than the law of Moses has; for though
the law of Moses supposes the immortality of the soul and a future
state, as principles of what is called natural religion, yet no express
revelation of it is made by the law of Moses; because so much of that
law was peculiar to that people, and was therefore guarded as municipal
laws used to be with temporal promises and threatenings, and the more
express revelation of a future state was reserved for the latter days;
but our Saviour finds a very solid argument for the resurrection even in
the writings of Moses. Much scripture lies under ground, that must be
digged for.

2\. What his argument was ([Mat
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#032).md); I am the God of Abraham. This
was not an express proof, totidem verbis - in so many words; and yet it
was really a conclusive argument. Consequences from scripture, if
rightly deduced, must be received as scripture; for it was written for
those that have the use of reason.

Now the drift of the argument is to prove,

(1.) That there is a future state, another life after this, in which the
righteous shall be truly and constantly happy. This is proved from what
God said; I am the God of Abraham.

\[1.\] For God to be any one's God supposes some very extraordinary
privilege and happiness; unless we know fully what God is, we could not
comprehend the riches of that word, I will be to thee a God, that is, a
Benefactor like myself. The God of Israel is a God to Israel ([Ch1
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#024).md), a spiritual Benefactor; for he
is the Father of spirits, and blesseth with spiritual blessings: it is
to be an all-sufficient Benefactor, a God that is enough, a complete
Good, and an eternal Benefactor; for he is himself an everlasting God,
and will be to those that are in covenant with him an everlasting Good.
This great word God had often said to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and it
was intended as a recompence for their singular faith and obedience, in
quitting the country at God's call. The Jews had a profound veneration
for those three patriarchs, and would extend the promise God made them
to the uttermost.

\[2.\] It is manifest that these good men had no such extraordinary
happiness, in this life, as might look any thing like the accomplishment
of so great a word as that. They were strangers in the land of promise,
wandering, pinched with famine; they had not a foot of ground of their
own but a burying-place, which directed them to look for something
beyond this life. In present enjoyments they came far short of their
neighbours that were strangers to this covenant. What was there in this
world to distinguish them and the heirs of their faith from other
people, any whit proportionable to the dignity and distinction of this
covenant? If no happiness had been reserved for these great and good men
on the other side of death, that melancholy word of poor Jacob's, when
he was old ([Gen 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#009).md), Few and evil
have the days of the years of my life been, would have been an eternal
reproach to the wisdom, goodness, and faithfulness, of that God who had
so often called himself the God of Jacob.

\[3.\] Therefore there must certainly be a future state, in which, as
God will ever live to be eternally rewarding, so Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, will ever live to be eternally rewarded. That of the apostle
([Heb 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016).md), is a key to this
argument, where, when he had been speaking of the faith and obedience of
the patriarchs in the land of their pilgrimage, he adds, Wherefore God
is not ashamed to be called their God; because he has provided for them
a city, a heavenly city; implying, that if he had not provided so well
for them in the other world, considering how they sped in this, he would
have been ashamed to have called himself their God; but now he is not,
having done that for them which answers it in its true intent and full
extent.

(2.) That the soul is immortal, and the body shall rise again, to be
united; if the former point be gained, these will follow; but they are
likewise proved by considering the time when God spoke this; it was to
Moses at the bush, long after Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, were dead and
buried; and yet God saith, not, "I was," or "have been," but I am the
God of Abraham. Now God is not God of the dead, but of the living. He is
a living God, and communicates vital influences to those to whom he is a
God. If, when Abraham died, there had been an end of him, there had been
an end likewise of God's relation to him as his God; but at that time,
when God spoke to Moses, he was the God of Abraham, and therefore
Abraham must be then alive; which proves the immortality of the soul in
a state of bliss; and that, by consequence, infers the resurrection of
the body; for there is such an inclination in the human soul to its
body, as would make a final and eternal separation inconsistent with the
bliss of those that have God for their God. The Sadducees' notion was,
that the union between body and soul is so close, that, when the body
dies, the soul dies with it. Now, upon the same hypothesis, if the soul
lives, as it certainly does, the body must some time or other live with
it. And besides, the Lord is for the body, it is an essential part of
the man; there is a covenant with the dust, which will be remembered,
otherwise the man would not be happy. The charge which the dying
patriarchs gave concerning their bones, and that in faith, was an
evidence that they had some expectation of the resurrection of their
bodies. But this doctrine was reserved for a more full revelation after
the resurrection of Christ, who was the first-fruits of them that slept.

Lastly, We have the issue of this dispute. The Sadducees were put to
silence ([Mat 22:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#034).md), and so put to
shame. They thought by their subtlety to put Christ to shame, when they
were preparing shame for themselves. But the multitude were astonished
at this doctrine, [Mat 22:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#033.md). 1.
Because it was new to them. See to what a sad pass the exposition of
scripture was come among them, when people were astonished at it as a
miracle to hear the fundamental promise applied to this great truth;
they had sorry scribes, or this had been no news to them. 2. Because it
had something in it very good and great. Truth often shows the brighter,
and is the more admired, for its being opposed. Observe, Many gainsayers
are silenced, and many hearers astonished, without being savingly
converted; yet even in the silence and astonishment of unsanctified
souls God magnifies his law, magnifies his gospel, and makes both
honourable.

[Matthew 22:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 22:34</span></span>

Here is a discourse which Christ had with a Pharisee-lawyer, about the
great commandment of the law. Observe,

I. The combination of the Pharisees against Christ, [Mat
22:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#034.md). They heard that he had put the
Sadducees to silence, had stopped their mouths, though their
understandings were not opened; and they were gathered together, not to
return him the thanks of their party, as they ought to have done, for
his effectually asserting and confirming of the truth against the
Sadducees, the common enemies of their religion, but to tempt him, in
hopes to get the reputation of puzzling him who had puzzled the
Sadducees. They were more vexed that Christ was honoured, than pleased
that the Sadducees were silenced; being more concerned for their own
tyranny and traditions, which Christ opposed, than for the doctrine of
the resurrection and a future state, which the Sadducees opposed. Note,
It is an instance of Pharisaical envy and malice, to be displeased at
the maintaining of a confessed truth, when it is done by those we do not
like; to sacrifice a public good to private piques and prejudices.
Blessed Paul was otherwise minded, [Phi
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#018.md).

II\. The lawyer's question, which he put to Christ. The lawyers were
students in, and teachers of, the law of Moses, as the scribes were; but
some think that in this they differed, that they dealt more in practical
questions than the scribes; they studied and professed casuistical
divinity. This lawyer asked him a question, tempting him; not with any
design to ensnare him, as appears by St. Mark's relation of the story,
where we find that this was he to whom Christ said, Thou are not far
from the kingdom of God, [Mar 12:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#034.md),
but only to see what he would say, and to draw on discourse with him, to
satisfy his own and his friends' curiosity.

1\. The question was, Master, which is the greatest commandment of the
law? A needless question, when all the things of God's law are great
things ([Hos 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#012).md), and the wisdom
from above is without partiality, partiality in the law ([Mal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#009).md), and hath respect to them all.
Yet it is true, there are some commands that are the principles of the
oracles of God, more extensive and inclusive than others. Our Saviour
speaks of the weightier matters of the law, [Mat
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023.md).

2\. The design was to try him, or tempt him; to try, not so much his
knowledge as his judgment. It was a question disputed among the critics
in the law. Some would have the law of circumcision to be the great
commandment, others the law of the sabbath, others the law of
sacrifices, according as they severally stood affected, and spent their
zeal; now they would try what Christ said to this question, hoping to
incense the people against him, if he should not answer according to the
vulgar opinion; and if he should magnify one commandment, they would
reflect on him as vilifying the rest. The question was harmless enough;
and it appears by comparing [Luk
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#027.md), [Luk
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#028.md), that it was an adjudged point
among the lawyers, that the love of God and our neighbour is the great
commandment, and the sum of all the rest, and Christ had there approved
it; so the putting of it to him here seems rather a scornful design to
catechise him as a child, than spiteful design to dispute with him as an
adversary.

III\. Christ's answer to this question; it is well for us that such a
question was asked him, that we might have his answer. It is no
disparagement to great men to answer plain questions. Now Christ
recommends to us those as the great commandments, not which are so
exclusive of others, but which are therefore great because inclusive of
others. Observe,

1\. Which these great commandments are ([Mat
22:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#037).md); not the judicial laws,
those could not be the greatest now that the people of the Jews, to whom
they pertained, were so little; not the ceremonial laws, those could not
be the greatest, now that they were waxen old, and were ready to vanish
away; nor any particular moral precept; but the love of God and our
neighbour, which are the spring and foundation of all the rest, which
(these being supposed) will follow of course.

(1.) All the law is fulfilled in one word, and that is, love. See [Rom
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#010.md). All obedience begins in the
affections, and nothing in religion is done right, that is not done
there first. Love is the leading affection, which gives law, and gives
ground, to the rest; and therefore that, as the main fort, is to be
first secured and garrisoned for God. Man is a creature cut out for
love; thus therefore is the law written in the heart, that it is a law
of love. Love is a short and sweet word; and, if that be the fulfilling
of the law, surely the yoke of the command is very easy. Love is the
rest and satisfaction of the soul; if we walk in this good old way, we
shall find rest.

(2.) The love of God is the first and great commandment of all, and the
summary of all the commands of the first table. The proper act of love
being complacency, good is the proper object of it. Now God, being good
infinitely, originally, and eternally, is to be loved in the first
place, and nothing loved beside him, but what is loved for him. Love is
the first and great thing that God demands from us, and therefore the
first and great thing that we should devote to him.

Now here we are directed,

\[1.\] To love God as ours; Thou shalt love the Lord they God as thine.
The first commandment is, Thou shalt have no other God; which implies
that we must have him for our God, and that will engage our love to him.
Those that made the sun and moon their gods, loved them, [Jer
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#002.md); [Jdg
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#024.md). To love God as ours is to love
him because he is ours, our Creator, Owner, and Ruler, and to conduct
ourselves to him as ours, with obedience to him, and dependence on him.
We must love God as reconciled to us, and made ours by covenant; that is
the foundation of this, Thy God.

\[2.\] To love him with all our heart, and soul, and mind. Some make
these to signify one and the same thing, to love him with all our
powers; others distinguish them; the heart, soul, and mind, are the
will, affections, and understanding; or the vital, sensitive, and
intellectual faculties. Our love of God must be a sincere love, and not
in word and tongue only, as theirs is who say they love him, but their
hearts are not with him. It must be a strong love, we must love him in
the most intense degree; as we must praise him, so we must love him,
with all that is within us, [Psa
103:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#001.md). It must be a singular and
superlative love, we must love him more than any thing else; this way
the stream of our affections must entirely run. The heart must be united
to love God, in opposition to a divided heart. All our love is too
little to bestow upon him, and therefore all the powers of the soul must
be engaged for him, and carried out toward him. This is the first and
great commandment; for obedience to this is the spring of obedience to
all the rest; which is then only acceptable, when it flows from love.

(3.) To love our neighbour as ourselves is the second great commandment
([Mat 22:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#039).md); It is like unto that
first; it is inclusive of all the precepts of the second table, as that
is of the first. It is like it, for it is founded upon it, and flows
from it; and a right love to our brother, whom we have seen, is both an
instance and an evidence of our love to God, whom we have not seen, [Jo1
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#020.md).

\[1.\] It is implied, that we do, and should, love ourselves. There is a
self-love which is corrupt, and the root of the greatest sins, and it
must be put off and mortified: but there is a self-love which is
natural, and the rule of the greatest duty, and it must be preserved and
sanctified. We must love ourselves, that is, we must have a due regard
to the dignity of our own natures, and a due concern for the welfare of
our own souls and bodies.

\[2.\] It is prescribed, that we love our neighbour as ourselves. We
must honour and esteem all men, and must wrong and injure none; must
have a good will to all, and good wishes for all, and, as we have
opportunity, must do good to all. We must love our neighbour as
ourselves, as truly and sincerely as we love ourselves, and in the same
instances; nay, in many cases we must deny ourselves for the good of our
neighbour, and must make ourselves servants to the true welfare of
others, and be willing to spend and be spent for them, to lay down our
lives for the brethren.

2\. Observe what the weight and greatness of these commandments is ([Mat
22:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#040).md); On these two commandments hang
all the law and the prophets; that is, This is the sum and substance of
all those precepts relating to practical religion which were written in
men's hearts by nature, revived by Moses, and backed and enforced by the
preaching and writing of the prophets. All hang upon the law of love;
take away this, and all falls to the ground, and comes to nothing.
Rituals and ceremonials must give way to these, as must all spiritual
gifts, for love is the more excellent way. This is the spirit of the
law, which animates it, the cement of the law, which joins it; it is the
root and spring of all other duties, the compendium of the whole Bible,
not only of the law and the prophets, but of the gospel too, only
supposing this love to be the fruit of faith, and that we love God in
Christ, and our neighbour for his sake. All hangs on these two
commandments, as the effect doth both on its efficient and on its final
cause; for the fulfilling of the law is love ([Rom
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#010).md) and the end of the law is love,
[Ti1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005.md). The law of love is the nail,
is the nail in the sure place, fastened by the masters of assemblies
([Ecc 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#011).md), on which is hung all the
glory of the law and the prophets ([Isa
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#024).md), a nail that shall never be
drawn; for on this nail all the glory of the new Jerusalem shall
eternally hang. Love never faileth. Into these two great commandments
therefore let our hearts be delivered as into a mould; in the defence
and evidence of these let us spend our zeal, and not in notions, names,
and strifes of words, as if those were the mighty things on which the
law and the prophets hung, and to them the love of God and our neighbour
must be sacrificed; but to the commanding power of these let every thing
else be made to bow.

[Matthew 22:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mat 22:41</span></span>

Many questions the Pharisees had asked Christ, by which, though they
thought to pose him, they did but expose themselves; but now let him ask
them a question; and he will do it when they are gathered together, [Mat
22:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#041.md). He did not take some one of
them apart from the rest (ne Hercules contra duos - Hercules himself may
be overmatched), but, to shame them the more, he took them all together,
when they were in confederacy and consulting against him, and yet
puzzled them. Note, God delights to baffle his enemies when they most
strengthen themselves; he gives them all the advantages they can wish
for, and yet conquers them. Associate yourselves, and you shall be
broken in pieces, [Isa 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#009.md), [Isa
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010.md). Now here,

I. Christ proposes a question to them, which they could easily answer;
it was a question in their own catechism; "What think ye of Christ?
Whose Son is He? Whose Son do you expect the Messiah to be, who was
promised to the fathers?" This they could easily answer, The Son of
David. It was the common periphrasis of the Messiah; they called him the
Son of David. So the scribes, who expounded the scripture, had taught
them, from [Psa 89:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#035.md), [Psa
89:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#036.md), I will not lie unto David; his
seed shall endure for ever ([Isa 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007).md),
upon the throne of David. And [Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md), A rod out of the stem of Jesse.
The covenant of royalty made with David was a figure of the covenant of
redemption made with Christ, who as David, was made King with an oath,
and was first humbled and then advanced. If Christ was the Son of David,
he was really and truly Man. Israel said, We have ten parts in David;
and Judah said, He is our bone and our flesh; what part have we then in
the Son of David, who took our nature upon him?

What think ye of Christ? They had put questions to him, one after
another, out of the law; but he comes and puts a question to them upon
the promise. Many are so full of the law, that they forget Christ, as if
their duties would save them without his merit and grace. It concerns
each of us seriously to ask ourselves, What think we of Christ? Some
think not of him at all, he is not in all, not in any, of their
thoughts; some think meanly, and some think hardly, of him; but to them
that believe he is precious; and how precious then are the thoughts of
him! While the daughters of Jerusalem think no more of Christ than of
another beloved; the spouse thinks of him as the Chief of ten thousands.

II\. He starts a difficulty upon their answer, which they could not
easily solve, [Mat 22:43-45](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#043.md). Many can
so readily affirm the truth, that they think they have knowledge enough
to be proud of, who, when they are called to confirm the truth, and to
vindicate and defend it, show they have ignorance enough to be ashamed
of. The objection Christ raised was, If Christ be David's son, how then
doth David, in spirit, call him Lord? He did not hereby design to
ensnare them, as they did him, but to instruct them in a truth they were
loth to believe - that the expected Messiah is God.

1\. It is easy to see that David calls Christ Lord, and this in spirit
being divinely inspired, and actuated therein by a spirit of prophecy;
for it was the Spirit of the Lord that spoke by him, [Sa2
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001.md), [Sa2
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#002.md). David was one of those holy men
that spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, especially in calling
Christ Lord; for it was then, as it is still ([Co1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003).md) that no man can say that Jesus
is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. Now, to prove that David, in spirit,
called Christ Lord, he quotes [Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md), which psalm the scribes
themselves understood of Christ; of him, it is certain, the prophet
there speaks, of him and of no other man; and it is a prophetical
summary of the doctrine of Christ, it describes him executing the
offices of a Prophet, Priest, and King, both in his humiliation and also
in his exaltation.

Christ quotes the whole verse, which shows the Redeemer in his
exaltation; (1.) Sitting at the right hand of God. His sitting denotes
both rest and rule; his sitting at God's right hand denotes superlative
honour and sovereign power. See in what great words this is expressed
([Heb 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#001).md); He is set on the right
hand of the throne of the Majesty. See [Phi
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009.md); [Eph
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md). He did not take this honour to
himself, but was entitled to it by covenant with his Father, and
invested in it by commission from him, and here is that commission. (2.)
Subduing his enemies. There he shall sit, till they be all made either
his friends or his footstool. The carnal mind, wherever it is, is enmity
to Christ; and that is subdued in the conversion of the willing people
that are called to his foot (as the expression is, [Isa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002).md), and in the confusion of his
impenitent adversaries, who shall be brought under his foot, as the
kings of Canaan were under the feet of Joshua.

But that which this verse is quoted for is, that David calls the Messiah
his Lord; the Lord, Jehovah, said unto my Lord. This intimates to us,
that in expounding scripture we must take notice of, and improve, not
only that which is the main scope and sense of a verse, but of the words
and phrases, by which they Spirit chooses to express that sense, which
have often a very useful and instructive significance. Here is a good
note from that word, My Lord.

2\. It is not so easy for those who believe not the Godhead of the
Messiah, to clear this from an absurdity, if Christ b David's son. It is
incongruous for the father to speak of his son, the predecessor of his
successor, as his Lord. If David call him Lord, that is laid down ([Mat
22:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#045).md) as the magis notum - the more
evident truth; for whatever is said of Christ's humanity and humiliation
must be construed and understood in consistency with the truth of his
divine nature and dominion. We must hold this fast, that he is David's
Lord, and by that explain his being David's son. The seeming differences
of scripture, as here, may not only be accommodated, but contribute to
the beauty and harmony of the whole. Amicae scripturarum lites, utinam
et nostrae - The differences observable in the scriptures are of a
friendly kind; would to God that our differences were of the same kind!

III\. We have here the success of this gentle trial which Christ made of
the Pharisees' knowledge, in two things.

1\. It puzzled them ([Mat 22:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#046).md); No
man was able to answer him a word. Either it was their ignorance that
they did not know, or their impiety that they would not own, the Messiah
to be God; which truth was the only key to unlock this difficulty. What
those Rabbies could not then answer, blessed be God, the plainest
Christian that is led into the understanding of the gospel of Christ,
can now account for; that Christ, as God, was David's Lord; and Christ,
as Man, was David's son. This he did not now himself explain, but
reserved it till the proof of it was completed by his resurrection; but
we have it fully explained by him in his glory ([Rev
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016).md); I am the root and the
offspring of David. Christ, as God, was David's Root; Christ, as Man,
was David's Offspring. If we hold not fast this truth, that Jesus Christ
is over all God blessed for ever, we run ourselves into inextricable
difficulties. And well might David, his remote ancestor, call him Lord,
when Mary, his immediate mother, after she had conceived him, called
him, Lord and God, her Saviour, [Luk
1:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#046.md), [Luk
1:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#047.md).

2\. It silenced them, and all others that sought occasion against him;
Neither durst any man, from that day forth, ask him any more such
captious, tempting, ensnaring questions. Note, God will glorify himself
in the silencing of many whom he will not glorify himself in the
salvation of. Many are convinced, that are not converted, by the word.
Had these been converted, they would have asked him more questions,
especially that great question, What must we do to be saved? But since
they could not gain their point, they would have no more to do with him.
But, thus all that strive with their Master shall be convinced, as these
Pharisees and lawyers here were, of the inequality of the match.
