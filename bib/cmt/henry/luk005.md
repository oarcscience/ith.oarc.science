### [Luke Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001.md)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 5:0</span></span>

In this chapter, we have, I. Christ preaching to the people out of
Peter's ship, for want of a better pulpit ([Luk
5:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001).md). II. The recompence he made to
Peter for the loan of his boat, in a miraculous draught of fishes, by
which he intimated to him and his partners his design to make them, as
apostles, fishers of men ([Luk
5:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#004).md). III. His cleansing the leper
([Luk 5:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#012).md). IV. A short account of
his private devotion and public ministry ([Luk
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#016.md), [Luk
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#017).md). V. His cure of the man sick of
the palsy ([Luk 5:18-26](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#018).md). VI. His
calling Levi the publican, and conversing with publicans on that
occasion ([Luk 5:27-32](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#027).md). VII. His
justifying his disciples in not fasting so frequently as the disciples
of John and the Pharisees did ([Luk
5:33-39](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#033).md).

[Luke 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 5:1</span></span>

This passage of story fell, in order of time, before the two miracles we
had in the close of the foregoing chapter, and is the same with that
which was more briefly related by Matthew and Mark, of Christ's calling
Peter and Andrew to be fishers of men, [Mat
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018.md), and [Mar
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#016.md). They had not related this
miraculous draught of fishes at that time, having only in view the
calling of his disciples; but Luke gives us that story as one of the
many signs which Jesus did in the presence of his disciples, which had
not been written in the foregoing books, [Joh
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#030.md), [Joh
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#031.md). Observe here,

I. What vast crowds attended Christ's preaching: The people pressed upon
him to hear the word of God ([Luk
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001).md), insomuch that no house would
contain them, but he was forced to draw them out to the strand, that
they might be reminded of the promise made to Abraham, that his seed
should be as the sand upon the sea shore ([Gen
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017).md), and yet of them but a remnant
shall be saved, [Rom 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#027.md). The people
flocked about him (so the word signifies); they showed respect to his
preaching, though not without some rudeness to his person, which was
very excusable, for they pressed upon him. Some would reckon this a
discredit to him, to be thus cried up by the vulgar, when none of the
rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him; but he reckoned it an honour
to him, for their souls were as precious as the souls of the grandees,
and it is his aim to bring not so much the mighty as the many sons to
God. It was foretold concerning him that to him shall the gathering of
the people be. Christ was a popular preacher; and though he was able, at
twelve, to dispute with the doctors, yet he chose, at thirty, to preach
to the capacity of the vulgar. See how the people relished good
preaching, though under all external disadvantages: they pressed to hear
the word of God; they could perceive it to be the word of God, by the
divine power and evidence that went along with it, and therefore they
coveted to hear it.

II\. What poor conveniences Christ had for preaching: He stood by the
lake of Gennesareth ([Luk 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001).md), upon a
level with the crowd, so that they could neither see him nor hear him;
he was lost among them, and, every one striving to get near him, he was
crowded, and in danger of being crowded into the water: what must he do?
It does not appear that his hearers had any contrivance to give him
advantage, but there were two ships, or fishing boats, brought ashore,
one belonging to Simon and Andrew, the other to Zebedee and his sons,
[Luk 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#002.md). At first, Christ saw Peter
and Andrew fishing at some distance (so Matthew tells us, [Mat
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018).md); but he waited till they came to
land, and till the fishermen, that is, the servants, were gone out of
them having washed their nets, and thrown them by for that time: so
Christ entered into that ship that belonged to Simon, and begged of him
that he would lend it him for a pulpit; and, though he might have
commanded him, yet, for love's sake, he rather prayed him that he would
thrust out a little from the land, which would be the worse for his
being heard, but Christ would have it so, that he might the better be
seen; and it is his being lifted up that draws men to him. Wisdom cries
in the top of high places, [Pro 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#002.md).
It intimates that Christ had a strong voice (strong indeed, for he made
the dead to hear it), and that he did not desire to favour himself.
There he sat down, and taught the people the good knowledge of the Lord.

III\. What a particular acquaintance Christ, hereupon, fell into with
these fishermen. They had had some conversation with him before, which
began at John's baptism ([Joh 1:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#040.md),
[Joh 1:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#041).md); they were with him at Cana
of Galilee ([Joh 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#002).md), and in Judea
([Joh 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#003).md); but as yet they were not
called to attend him constantly, and therefore here we have them at
their calling, and now it was that they were called into a more intimate
fellowship with Christ.

1\. When Christ had done preaching, he ordered Peter to apply himself to
the business of his calling again: Launch out into the deep, and let
down your nets, [Luk 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#004.md). It was not
the sabbath day, and therefore, as soon as the lecture was over, he set
them to work. Time spent on week-days in the public exercises of
religion may be but little hindrance to us in time, and a great
furtherance to us in temper of mind, in our worldly business. With what
cheerfulness may we go about the duties of our calling when we have been
in the mount with God, and from thence fetch a double blessing into our
worldly employments, and thus have them sanctified to us by the word and
prayer! It is our wisdom and duty so to manage our religious exercises
as that they may befriend our worldly business, and so to manage our
worldly business as that it may be no enemy to our religious exercises.

2\. Peter having attended upon Christ in his preaching, Christ will
accompany him in his fishing. He staid with Christ at the shore, and now
Christ will launch out with him into the deep. Note, Those that will be
constant followers of Christ shall have him a constant guide to them.

3\. Christ ordered Peter and his ship's crew to cast their nets into the
sea, which they did, in obedience to him, though they had been hard at
it all night, and had caught nothing, [Luk
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#004.md), [Luk
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#005.md). We may observe here,

(1.) How melancholy their business had now been: "Master, we have toiled
all the night, when we should have been asleep in our beds, and have
taken nothing, but have had our labour for our pains." One would have
thought that this should have excused them from hearing the sermon; but
such a love had they to the word of God that it was more refreshing and
reviving to them, after a wearisome night, than the softest slumbers.
But they mention it to Christ, when he bids them go a fishing again.
Note, \[1.\] Some callings are much more toilsome than others are, and
more perilous; yet Providence has so ordered it for the common good that
there is no useful calling so discouraging but some or other have a
genius for it. Those who follow their business, and get abundance by it
with a great deal of ease, should think with compassion of those who
cannot follow theirs but with a great fatigue, and hardly get a bare
livelihood by it. When we have rested all night, let us not forget those
who have toiled all night, as Jacob, when he kept Laban's sheep. \[2.\]
Be the calling ever so laborious, it is good to see people diligent in
it, and make the best of it; these fishermen, that were thus
industrious, Christ singled out for his favourites. They were fit to be
preferred as good soldiers of Jesus Christ who had thus learned to
endure hardness. \[3.\] Even those who are most diligent in their
business often meet with disappointments; they who toiled all night yet
caught nothing; for the race is not always to the swift. God will have
us to be diligent, purely in duty to his command and dependence upon his
goodness, rather than with an assurance of worldly success. We must do
our duty, and then leave the event to God. \[4.\] When we are tired with
our worldly business, and crossed in our worldly affairs, we are welcome
to come to Christ, and spread our case before him, who will take
cognizance of it.

(2.) How ready their obedience was to the command of Christ:
Nevertheless, at thy word, I will let down the net. \[1.\] Though they
had toiled all night, yet, if Christ bid them, they will renew their
toil, for they know that they who wait on him shall renew their
strength, as work is renewed upon their hands; for every fresh service
they shall have a fresh supply of grace sufficient. \[2.\] Though they
have taken nothing, yet, if Christ bid them let down for a draught, they
will hope to take something. Note, We must not abruptly quit the
callings wherein we are called because we have not the success in them
we promised ourselves. The ministers of the gospel must continue to let
down that net, though they have perhaps toiled long and caught nothing;
and this is thank-worthy, to continue unwearied in our labours, though
we see not the success of them. \[3.\] In this they have an eye to the
word of Christ, and a dependence upon that: "At thy word, I will let
down the net, because thou dost enjoin it, and thou dost encourage it."
We are then likely to speed well when we follow the guidance of Christ's
word.

4\. The draught of fish they caught was so much beyond what was ever
known that it amounted to a miracle ([Luk
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#006).md): They enclosed a great multitude
of fishes, so that their net broke, and yet, which is strange, they did
not lose their draught. It was so great a draught that they had not
hands sufficient to draw it up; but they were obliged to beckon to their
partners, who were at a distance, out of call, to come and help them,
[Luk 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#007.md). But the greatest evidence of
the vastness of the draught was that they filled both the ships with
fish, to such a degree that they overloaded them, and they began to
sink, so that the fish had like to have been lost again with their own
weight. Thus many an overgrown estate, raised out of the water, returns
to the place whence it came. Suppose these ships were but five or six
tons a piece, what a vast quantity of fish must there be to load, nay to
over-load, them both!

Now by this vast draught of fishes, (1.) Christ intended to show his
dominion in the seas as well as on the dry land, over its wealth as over
its waves. Thus he would show that he was that Son of man under whose
feet all things were put, and particularly the fish of the sea and
whatsoever passeth through the paths of the sea, [Psa
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#008). (2..md) He intended hereby to
confirm the doctrine he had just now preached out of Peter's ship. We
may suppose that the people on shore, who heard the sermon, having a
notion that the preacher was a prophet sent of God, carefully attended
his motions afterward, and staid halting about there, to see what he
would do next; and this miracle immediately following would be a
confirmation to their faith, of his being at least a teacher come from
God. (3.) He intended hereby to repay Peter for the loan of his boat;
for Christ's gospel now, as his ark formerly in the house of Obed-edom,
will be sure to make amends, rich amends, for its kind entertainment.
None shall shut a door or kindle a fire in God's house for nought, [Mal
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#010.md). Christ's recompences for
services done to his name are abundant, they are superabundant. (4.) He
intended hereby to give a specimen, to those who were to be his
ambassadors to the world, of the success of their embassy, that though
they might for a time, and in one particular place, toil and catch
nothing, yet they should be instrumental to bring in many to Christ, and
enclose many in the gospel net.

5\. The impression which this miraculous draught of fishes made upon
Peter was very remarkable.

(1.) All concerned were astonished, and the more astonished for their
being concerned. All the boat's crew were astonished at the draught of
fishes which they had taken ([Luk
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#009).md); they were all surprised; and the
more they considered it, and all the circumstances of it, the more they
were wonder-struck, I had almost said thunder-struck, at the thought of
it, and so were also James and John, who were partners with Simon ([Luk
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#010).md), and who, for aught that
appears, were not so well acquainted with Christ, before this, as Peter
and Andrew were. Now they were the more affected with it, \[1.\] Because
they understood it better than others did. They that were well
acquainted with this sea, and it is probable had plied upon it many
years, had never seen such a draught of fishes fetched out of it, nor
any thing like it, any thing near it; and therefore they could not be
tempted to diminish it, as others might, by suggesting that it was
accidental at this time, and what might as well have happened at any
time. It greatly corroborates the evidence of Christ's miracles that
those who were best acquainted with them most admired them. \[2.\]
Because they were most interested in it, and benefited by it. Peter and
his part-owners were gainers by this great draught of fishes; it was a
rich booty for them and therefore it transported them, and their joy was
a helper to their faith. Note, When Christ's works of wonder are to us,
in particular, works of grace, then especially they command our faith in
his doctrine.

(2.) Peter, above all the rest, was astonished to such a degree that he
fell down at Jesus's knees, as he sat in the stern of his boat, and
said, as one in an ecstasy or transport, that knew not where he was or
what he said, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord, [Luk
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#008.md). Not that he feared the weight of
the fish would sink him because he was a sinful man, but that he thought
himself unworthy of the favour of Christ's presence in his boat, and
worthy that it should be to him a matter rather of terror than of
comfort. This word of Peter's came from the same principle with theirs
who, under the Old Testament, so often said that they did exceedingly
fear and quake at the extraordinary display of the divine glory and
majesty. It was the language of Peter's humility and self-denial, and
had not the least tincture of the devils' dialect, What have we to do
with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? \[1.\] His acknowledgment was very
just, and what it becomes us all to make: I am a sinful man, O Lord.
Note, Even the best men are sinful men, and should be ready upon all
occasions to own it, and especially to own it to Jesus Christ; for to
whom else, but to him who came into the world to save sinners, should
sinful men apply themselves? \[2.\] His inference from it was what might
have been just, though really it was not so. If I be a sinful man, as
indeed I am, I ought to say, "Come to me, O Lord, or let me come to
thee, or I am undone, for ever undone." But, considering what reason
sinful men have to tremble before the holy Lord God and to dread his
wrath, Peter may well be excused, if, in a sense of his own sinfulness
and vileness, he cried out on a sudden, Depart from me. Note, Those whom
Christ designs to admit to the most intimate acquaintance with him he
first makes sensible that they deserve to be set at the greatest
distance from him. We must all own ourselves sinful men, and that
therefore Jesus Christ might justly depart from us; but we must
therefore fall down at his knees, to pray him that he would not depart;
for woe unto us if he leave us, if the Saviour depart from the sinful
man.

6\. The occasion which Christ took from this to intimate to Peter ([Luk
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#010).md), and soon after to James and
John ([Mat 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#021).md), his purpose to make
them his apostles, and instruments of planting his religion in the
world. He said unto Simon, who was in the greatest surprise of any of
them at this prodigious draught of fishes, "Thou shalt both see and do
greater things than these; fear not; let not this astonish thee; be not
afraid that, after having done thee this honour, it is so great that I
shall never do thee more; no, henceforth thou shalt catch men, by
enclosing them in the gospel net, and that shall be a greater instance
of the Redeemer's power, and his favour to thee, than this is; that
shall be a more astonishing miracle, and infinitely more advantageous
than this." When by Peter's preaching three thousand souls were, in one
day, added to the church, then the type of this great draught of fishes
was abundantly answered.

Lastly, The fishermen's farewell to their calling, in order to their
constant attendance on Christ ([Luk
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#011).md): When they had brought their
ships to land, instead of going to seek for a market for their fish,
that they might make the best hand they could of this miracle, they
forsook all and followed him, being more solicitous to serve the
interests of Christ than to advance any secular interests of their own.
It is observable that they left all to follow Christ, when their calling
prospered in their hands more than ever it had done and they had had
uncommon success in it. When riches increase, and we are therefore most
in temptation to set our hearts upon them, then to quit them for the
service of Christ, this is thank-worthy.

[Luke 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 5:12</span></span>

Here is, I. The cleansing of a leper, [Luk
5:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#012.md). This narrative we had both in
Matthew and Mark. It is here said to have been in a certain city ([Luk
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#012).md); it was in Capernaum, but the
evangelist would not name it, perhaps because it was a reflection upon
the government of the city that a leper was suffered to be in it. This
man is said to be full of leprosy; he had that distemper in a high
degree, which the more fitly represents our natural pollution by sin; we
are full of that leprosy, from the crown of the head to the sole of the
foot there is no soundness in us. Now let us learn here,

1\. What we must do in the sense of our spiritual leprosy. (1.) We must
seek Jesus, enquire after him, acquaint ourselves with him, and reckon
the discoveries made to us of Christ by the gospel the most acceptable
and welcome discoveries that could be made to us. (2.) We must humble
ourselves before him, as this leper, seeing Jesus, fell on his face. We
must be ashamed of our pollution, and, in the sense of it, blush to lift
up our faces before the holy Jesus. (3.) We must earnestly desire to be
cleansed from the defilement, and cured of the disease, of sin, which
renders us unfit for communion with God. (4.) We must firmly believe
Christ's ability and sufficiency to cleanse us: Lord, thou canst make me
clean, though I be full of leprosy. No doubt is to be made of the merit
and grace of Christ. (5.) We must be importunate in prayer for pardoning
mercy and renewing grace: He fell on his face and besought him; they
that would be cleansed must reckon it a favour worth wrestling for. (6.)
We must refer ourselves to the good-will of Christ: Lord, if thou wilt,
thou canst. This is not so much the language of his diffidence, or
distrust of the good-will of Christ, as of his submission and reference
of himself and his case to the will, to the good-will, of Jesus Christ.

2\. What we may expect from Christ, if we thus apply ourselves to him.
(1.) We shall find him very condescending and forward to take cognizance
of our case ([Luk 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#013).md): He put forth
his hand and touched him. When Christ visited this leprous world,
unasked, unsought unto, he showed how low he could stoop, to do good.
His touching the leper was wonderful condescension; but it is much
greater to us when he is himself touched with the feeling of our
infirmities. (2.) We shall find him very compassionate, and ready to
relieve us; he said, "I will, never doubt of that; whosoever comes to me
to be healed, I will in no wise cast him out." He is as willing to
cleanse leprous souls as they can be to be cleansed. (3.) We shall find
him all-sufficient, and able to heal and cleanse us, though we be ever
so full of this loathsome leprosy. One word, one touch, from Christ, did
the business: Immediately the leprosy departed from him. If Christ
saith, "I will, be thou justified, be thou sanctified," it is done; for
he has power on earth to forgive sin, and power to give the Holy Spirit,
[Co1 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011.md).

3\. What he requires from those that are cleansed, [Luk
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#014.md). Has Christ sent his word and
healed us? (1.) We must be very humble ([Luk
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#014).md): He charged him to tell no man.
This, it should seem, did not forbid him telling it to the honour of
Christ, but he must not tell it to his own honour. Those whom Christ
hath healed and cleansed must know that he hath done it in such a way as
for ever excludes boasting. (2.) We must be very thankful, and make a
grateful acknowledgment of the divine grace: Go, and offer for thy
cleansing. Christ did not require him to give him a fee, but to bring
the sacrifice of praise to God; so far was he from using his power to
the prejudice of the law of Moses. (3.) We must keep close to our duty;
go to the priest, and those that attend him. The man whom Christ had
made whole he found in the temple, [Joh
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#014.md). Those who by any affliction have
been detained from public ordinances should, when the affliction is
removed, attend on them the more diligently, and adhere to them the more
constantly.

4\. Christ's public serviceableness to men and his private communion
with God; these are put together here, to give lustre to each other.

(1.) Though never any had so much pleasure in his retirements as Christ
had, yet he was much in a crowd, to do good, [Luk
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#015.md). Though the leper should
altogether hold his peace, yet the thing could not be hid, so much the
more went there a fame abroad of him. The more he sought to conceal
himself under a veil of humility, the more notice did people take of
him; for honour is like a shadow, which flees from those that pursue it
(for a man to seek his own glory is not glory), but follows those that
decline it, and draw from it. The less good men say of themselves, the
more will others say of them. But Christ reckoned it a small honour to
him that his fame went abroad; it was much more so that hereby
multitudes were brought to receive benefit by him. \[1.\] By his
preaching. They came together to hear him, and to receive instruction
from him concerning the kingdom of God. \[2.\] By his miracles. They
came to be healed by him of their infirmities; that invited them to come
to hear him, confirmed his doctrine, and recommended it.

(2.) Though never any did so much good in public, yet he found time for
pious and devout retirements ([Luk
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#016).md): He withdrew himself into the
wilderness, and prayed; not that he needed to avoid either distraction
or ostentation, but he would set us an example, who need to order the
circumstances of our devotion so as to guard against both. It is
likewise our wisdom so to order our affairs as that our public work and
our secret work may not intrench upon, nor interfere with, one another.
Note, Secret prayer must be performed secretly; and those that have ever
so much to do of the best business in this world must keep up constant
stated times for it.

[Luke 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 5:17</span></span>

Here is, I. A general account of Christ's preaching and miracles, [Luk
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#017.md). 1. He was teaching on a certain
day, not on the sabbath day, then he would have said so, but on a
week-day; six days shalt thou labour, not only for the world, but for
the soul, and the welfare of that. Preaching and hearing the word of God
are good works, if they be done well, any day in the week, as well as on
sabbath days. It was not in the synagogue, but in a private house; for
even there where we ordinarily converse with our friends it is not
improper to give and receive good instruction. 2. There he taught, he
healed (as before, [Luk 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#015).md): And the
power of the Lord was to heal them - ēn eis to iasthai autous. It was
mighty to heal them; it was exerted and put forth to heal them, to heal
those whom he taught (we may understand it so), to heal their souls, to
cure them of their spiritual diseases, and to give them a new life, a
new nature. Note, Those who receive the word of Christ in faith will
find a divine power going along with that word, to heal them; for Christ
came with his comforts to heal the broken-hearted, [Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md). The power of the Lord is present
with the word, present to those that pray for it and submit to it,
present to heal them. Or it may be meant (and so it is generally taken)
of the healing of those who were diseased in body, who came to him for
cures. Whenever there was occasion, Christ had not to seek for his
power, it was present to heal. 3. There were some grandees present in
this assembly, and, as it should seem, more than usual: There were
Pharisees, and doctors of the law, sitting by; not sitting at his feet,
to learn of him; then I should have been willing to take the following
clause as referring to those who are spoken of immediately before (the
power of the Lord was present to heal them); and why might not the word
of Christ reach their hearts? But, by what follows ([Luk
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#021).md), it appears that they were not
healed, but cavilled at Christ, which compels us to refer this to
others, not to them; for they sat by as persons unconcerned, as if the
word of Christ were nothing to them. They sat by as spectators, censors,
and spies, to pick up something on which to ground a reproach or
accusation. How many are there in the midst of our assemblies, where the
gospel is preached, that do not sit under the word, but sit by! It is to
them as a tale that is told them, not as a message that is sent them;
they are willing that we should preach before them, not that we should
preach to them. These Pharisees and scribes (or doctors of the law) came
out of every town of Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem; they came from
all parts of the nation. Probably, they appointed to meet at this time
and place, to see what remarks they could make upon Christ and what he
said and did. They were in a confederacy, as those that said, Come, and
let us devise devices against Jeremiah, and agree to smite him with the
tongue, [Jer 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018.md). Report, and we
will report it, [Jer 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#010.md). Observe,
Christ went on with his work of preaching and healing, though he saw
these Pharisees, and doctors of the Jewish church, sitting by, who, he
knew, despised him, and watched to ensnare him.

II\. A particular account of the cure of the man sick of the palsy,
which was related much as it is here by both the foregoing evangelists:
let us therefore only observe in short,

1\. The doctrines that are taught us and confirmed to us by the story of
this cure. (1.) That sin is the fountain of all sickness, and the
forgiveness of sin is the only foundation upon which a recovery from
sickness can comfortably be built. They presented the sick man to
Christ, and he said, "Man, thy sins are forgiven thee ([Luk
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#020).md), that is the blessing thou art
most to prize and seek; for if thy sins be forgiven thee, though the
sickness be continued, it is in mercy; if they be not, though the
sickness be removed, it is in wrath." The cords of our iniquity are the
bands of our affliction. (2.) That Jesus Christ has power on earth to
forgive sins, and his healing diseases was an incontestable proof of it.
This was the thing intended to be proved ([Luk
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#024).md): That ye may know and believe
that the Son of man, though now upon earth in his state of humiliation,
hath power to forgive sins, and to release sinners, upon gospel terms,
from the eternal punishment of sin, he saith to the sick of the palsy,
Arise, and walk; and he is cured immediately. Christ claims one of the
prerogatives of the King of kings when he undertakes to forgive sin, and
it is justly expected that he should produce a good proof of it. "Well,"
saith he, "I will put it upon this issue: here is a man struck with a
palsy, and for his sin; if I do not with a word's speaking cure his
disease in an instant, which cannot be done by nature or art, but purely
by the immediate power and efficacy of the God of nature, then say that
I am not entitled to the prerogative of forgiving sin, am not the
Messiah, am not the Son of God and King of Israel: but, if I do, you
must own that I have power to forgive sins." Thus it was put upon a fair
trial, and one word of Christ determined it. He did but say, Arise, take
up thy couch, and that chronical disease had an instantaneous cure;
immediately he arose before them. They must all own that there could be
no cheat or fallacy in it. They that brought him could attest how
perfectly lame he was before; they that saw him could attest how
perfectly well he was now, insomuch that he had strength enough to take
up and carry away the bed he lay upon. How well is it for us that this
most comfortable doctrine of the gospel, that Jesus Christ, our Redeemer
and Saviour, has power to forgive sin, has such a full attestation! (3.)
That Jesus Christ is God. He appears to be so, \[1.\] By knowing the
thoughts of the scribes and Pharisees ([Luk
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#022).md), which it is God's prerogative
to do, though these scribes and Pharisees knew as well how to conceal
their thoughts, and keep their countenances, as most men, and probably
were industrious to do it at this time, for they lay in wait secretly.
\[2.\] By doing that which their thoughts owned none could do but God
only ([Luk 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#021).md): Who can forgive
sins, say they, but only God? "I will prove," saith Christ, "that I can
forgive sins;" and what follows then but that he is God? What horrid
wickedness then were they guilty of who charged him with speaking the
worst of blasphemies, even when he spoke the best of blessings, Thy sins
are forgiven thee!

2\. The duties that are taught us, and recommended to us, by this story.
(1.) In our applications to Christ, we must be very pressing and urgent:
that is an evidence of faith, and is very pleasing to Christ and
prevailing with him. They that were the friends of this sick man sought
means to bring him in before Christ ([Luk
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#018).md); and, when they were baffled in
their endeavour, they did not give up their cause; but when they could
not get in by the door, it was so crowded, they untiled the house, and
let the poor patient down through the roof, into the midst before Jesus,
[Luk 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#019.md). In this Jesus Christ saw
their faith, [Luk 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#020.md). Now here he
has taught us (and it were well if we could learn the lesson) to put the
best construction upon words and actions that they will bear. When the
centurion and the woman of Canaan were in no care at all to bring the
patients they interceded for into Christ's presence, but believed that
he could cure them at a distance, he commended their faith. But though
in these there seemed to be a different notion of the thing, and an
apprehension that it was requisite the patient should be brought into
his presence, yet he did not censure and condemn their weakness, did not
ask them, "Why do you give this disturbance to the assembly? Are you
under such a degree of infidelity as to think I could not have cured
him, though he had been out of doors?" But he made the best of it, and
even in this he saw their faith. It is a comfort to us that we serve a
Master that is willing to make the best of us. (2.) When we are sick, we
should be more in care to get our sins pardoned than to get our sickness
removed. Christ, in what he said to this man, taught us, when we seek to
God for health, to begin with seeking to him for pardon. (3.) The
mercies which we have the comfort of God must have the praise of. The
man departed to his own house, glorifying God, [Luk
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#025.md). To him belong the escapes from
death, and in them therefore he must be glorified. (4.) The miracles
which Christ wrought were amazing to those that saw them, and we ought
to glorify God in them, [Luk 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#026.md).
They said, "We have seen strange things today, such as we never saw
before, nor our fathers before us; they are altogether new." But they
glorified God, who had sent into their country such a benefactor to it;
and were filled with fear, with a reverence of God, with a jealous
persuasion that this was the Messiah and that he was not treated by
their nation as he ought to be, which might prove in the end the ruin of
their state; perhaps they were some such thoughts as these that filled
them with fear, and a concern likewise for themselves.

[Luke 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 5:27</span></span>

All this, except the last verse, we had before in Matthew and Mark; it
is not the story of any miracle in nature wrought by our Lord Jesus, but
it is an account of some of the wonders of his grace, which, to those
who understand things aright, are no less cogent proofs of Christ's
being sent of God than the other.

I. It was a wonder of his grace that he would call a publican, from the
receipt of custom, to be his disciple and follower, [Luk
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#027.md). It was wonderful condescension
that he should admit poor fishermen to that honour, men of the lowest
rank; but much more wonderful that he should admit publicans, men of the
worst reputation, men of ill fame. In this Christ humbled himself, and
appeared in the likeness of sinful flesh. By this he exposed himself,
and got the invidious character of a friend of publicans and sinners.

II\. It was a wonder of his grace that the call was made effectual,
became immediately so, [Luk 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#028.md). This
publican, though those of that employment commonly had little
inclination to religion, for his religion's sake left a good place in
the custom-house (which, probably, was his livelihood, and where he
stood fair for better preferment), and rose up, and followed Christ.
There is no heart too hard for the Spirit and grace of Christ to work
upon, nor any difficulties in the way of a sinner's conversion
insuperable to his power.

III\. It was a wonder of his grace that he would not only admit a
converted publican into his family, but would keep company with
unconverted publicans, that he might have an opportunity of doing their
souls good; he justified himself in it, as agreeing with the great
design of his coming into the world. Here is a wonder of grace indeed,
that Christ undertakes to be the Physician of souls distempered by sin,
and ready to die of the distemper (he is a Healer by office, [Luk
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#031).md) - that he has a particular
regard to the sick, to sinners as his patients, convinced awakened
sinners, that see their need of the Physician - that he came to call
sinners, the worst of sinners, to repentance, and to assure them of
pardon, upon repentance, [Luk 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#032.md).
These are glad tidings of great joy indeed.

IV\. It was a wonder of his grace that he did so patiently bear the
contradiction of sinners against himself and his disciples, [Luk
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#030.md). He did not express his
resentment of the cavils of the scribes and Pharisees, as he justly
might have done, but answered them with reason and meekness; and,
instead of taking that occasion to show his displeasure against the
Pharisees, as afterwards he did, or of recriminating upon them, he took
that occasion to show his compassion to poor publicans, another sort of
sinners, and to encourage them.

V. It was a wonder of his grace that, in the discipline under which he
trained up his disciples, he considered their frame, and proportioned
their services to their strength and standing, and to the circumstances
they were in. It was objected, as a blemish upon his conduct, that he
did not make his disciples to fast so often as those of the Pharisees
and John Baptist did, [Luk 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#033.md). He
insisted most upon that which is the soul of fasting, the mortification
of sin, the crucifying of the flesh, and the living of a life of
self-denial, which is as much better than fasting and corporal penances
as mercy is better than sacrifice.

VI\. It was a wonder of his grace that Christ reserved the trials of his
disciples for their latter times, when by his grace they were in some
good measure better prepared and fitted for them than they were at
first. Now they were as the children of the bride-chamber, when the
bridegroom is with them, when they have plenty and joy, and every day is
a festival. Christ was welcomed wherever he came, and they for his sake,
and as yet they met with little or no opposition; but this will not last
always. The days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from
them, [Luk 5:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#035.md). When Christ shall
leave them with their hearts full of sorrow, their hands full of work,
and the world full of enmity and rage against them, then shall they
fast, shall not be so well fed as they are now. We both hunger and
thirst and are naked, [Co1 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#011.md). Then
they shall keep many more religious fasts than they do now, for
Providence will call them to it; they will then serve the Lord with
fastings, [Act 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002.md).

VII\. It was a wonder of his grace that he proportioned their exercises
to their strength. He would not put new cloth upon an old garment ([Luk
5:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#036).md), nor new wine into old bottles
([Luk 5:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#037.md), [Luk
5:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#038).md); he would not, as soon as ever
he had called them out of the world, put them upon the strictnesses and
austerities of discipleship, lest they should be tempted to fly off.
When God brought Israel out of Egypt, he would not bring them by the way
of the Philistines, lest they should repent, when they saw war, and
return to Egypt, [Exo 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#017.md). So Christ
would train up his followers gradually to the discipline of his family;
for no man, having drank old wine, will of a sudden, straightway, desire
new, or relish it, but will say, The old is better, because he has been
used to it, [Luk 5:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#039.md). The disciples
will be tempted to think their old way of living better, till they are
by degrees trained up to this way whereunto they are called. Or, turn it
the other way: "Let them be accustomed awhile to religious exercises,
and then they will abound in them as much as you do: but we must not be
too hasty with them." Calvin takes it as an admonition to the Pharisees
not to boast of their fasting, and the noise and show they made with it,
nor to despise his disciples because they did not in like manner
signalize themselves; for the profession the Pharisees made was indeed
pompous and gay, like new wine that is brisk and sparkling, whereas all
wise men say, The old is better; for, though it does not give its colour
so well in the cup, yet it is more warming in the stomach and more
wholesome. Christ's disciples, though they had not so much of the form
of godliness, had more of the power of it.
