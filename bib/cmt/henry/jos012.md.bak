### [Joshua Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 12:0</span></span>

This chapter is a summary of Israel's conquests. I. Their conquests
under Moses, on the other side Jordan (for we now suppose ourselves in
Canaan) eastward, which we had the history of, [Num
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#024.md), etc. And here the abridgment of
that history ([Jos 12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001).md). II. Their
conquests under Joshua, on this side Jordan, westward. 1. The country
they reduced ([Jos 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#007.md), [Jos
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#008).md). 2. The kings they subdued,
thirty-one in all (v. 9-24). And this comes in here, not only as a
conclusion of the history of the wars of Canaan (that we might at one
view see what they had got), but as a preface to the history of the
dividing of Canaan, that all that might be put together which they were
not to make a distribution of.

[Joshua 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 12:1</span></span>

Joshua, or whoever else is the historian before he comes to sum up the
new conquests Israel had made, in these verses receives their former
conquests in Moses's time, under whom they became masters of the great
and potent kingdoms of Sihon and Og. Note, Fresh mercies must not drown
the remembrance of former mercies, nor must the glory of the present
instruments of good to the church be suffered to eclipse and diminish
the just honour of those who have gone before them, and who were the
blessings and ornaments of their day. Joshua's services and achievements
are confessedly great, but let not those under Moses be overlooked and
forgotten, since God was the same who wrought both, and both put
together proclaim him the Alpha and Omega of Israel's great salvation.
Here is, 1. A description of this conquered country, the measure and
bounds of it in general ([Jos 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001).md):
From the river Arnon in the south, to Mount Hermon in the north. In
particular, here is a description of the kingdom of Sihon ([Jos
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#002.md), [Jos
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#003).md), and that of Og, [Jos
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#004.md), [Jos
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#005.md). Moses had described this country
very particularly ([Deu 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#036.md); [Deu
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#004), etc..md), and this description here
agrees with his. King Og is said to dwell at Ashtaroth and Edrei ([Jos
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#004).md), probably because they were both
his royal cities; he had palaces in both, and resided sometimes in one
and sometimes in the other; one perhaps was his summer seat and the
other his winter seat. But Israel took both from him, and made one grave
to serve him that could not be content with one palace. 2. The
distribution of this country. Moses assigned it to the two tribes and a
half, at their request, and divided it among them ([Jos
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#006).md), of which we had the story at
large, Num. 32. The dividing of it when it was conquered by Moses is
here mentioned as an example to Joshua what he must do now that he had
conquered the country on this side Jordan. Moses, in his time, gave to
one part of Israel a very rich and fruitful country, but it was on the
outside of Jordan; but Joshua gave to all Israel the holy land, the
mountain of God's sanctuary, within Jordan: so the law conferred upon
some few of God's spiritual Israel external temporal blessings, which
were earnests of good things to come; but our Lord Jesus, the true
Joshua, has provided for all the children of promise spiritual blessings
- the privileges of the sanctuary, and the heavenly Canaan. The triumphs
and grants of the law were glorious, but those of the gospel far exceed
in glory.

[Joshua 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 12:7</span></span>

We have here a breviate of Joshua's conquests.

I. The limits of the country he conquered. It lay between Jordan on the
east and the Mediterranean Sea on the west, and extended from Baal-gad
near Lebanon in the north to Halak, which lay upon the country of Edom
in the south, v. 7. The boundaries are more largely described, [Num
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#002.md), etc. But what is here said is
enough to show that God had been as good as his word, and had given them
possession of all he had promised them by Moses, if they would but have
kept it.

II\. The various kinds of land that were found in this country, which
contributed both to its pleasantness and to its fruitfulness, [Jos
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#008.md). There were mountains, not
craggy, and rocky, and barren, which are frightful to the traveller and
useless to the inhabitants, but fruitful hills, such as put forth
precious things ([Deu 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#015).md), which
charmed the spectator's eye and filled the owner's hand. And valleys,
not mossy and boggy, but covered with corn, [Psa
65:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#013.md). There were plains, and springs
to water them; and even in that rich land there were wildernesses too,
or forests, which were not so thickly inhabited as other parts, yet had
towns and houses in them, but served as foils to set off the more
pleasant and fruitful countries.

III\. The several nations that had been in possession of this country -
Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, etc., all of them descended from Canaan,
the accursed son of Ham, [Gen
10:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#015.md). Seven nations they are
called ([Deu 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001).md), and so many are
there reckoned up, but here six only are mentioned, the Girgashites
being either lost or left out, though we find them, [Gen
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#016.md) and [Gen
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#021.md). Either they were incorporated
with some other of these nations, or, as the tradition of the Jews is,
upon the approach of Israel under Joshua they all withdrew and went into
Africa, leaving their country to be possessed by Israel, with whom they
saw it was to no purpose to contend, and therefore they are not named
among the nations that Joshua subdued.

IV\. A list of the kings that were conquered and subdued by the sword of
Israel, some in the field, others in their own cities, thirty-one in
all, and very particularly named and counted, it should seem, in the
order in which they were conquered; for the catalogue begins with the
kings of Jericho and Ai, then takes in the king of Jerusalem and the
princes of the south that were in confederacy with him, and then
proceeds to those of the northern association. Now, 1. This shows what a
very fruitful country Canaan then was, which could support so many
kingdoms, and in which so many kings chose to throng together rather
than disperse themselves into other countries, which we may suppose not
yet inhabited, but where, though they might find more room, they could
not expect such plenty and pleasure: this was the land God spied out for
Israel; and yet at this day it is one of the most barren, despicable,
and unprofitable countries in the world: such is the effect of the curse
it lies under, since its possessors rejected Christ and his gospel, as
was foretold by Moses, [Deu 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023.md). 2.
It shows what narrow limits men's ambition was then confined to. These
kings contented themselves with the government, each of them, of one
city and the towns and villages that pertained to it; and no one of
them, for aught that appears, aimed to make himself master of the rest,
but, when there was occasion, all united for the common safety. Yet it
should seem that what was wanting in the extent of their territories was
made up in the absoluteness of their power, their subjects being all
their tenants and vassals, and entirely at their command. 3. It shows
how good God was to Israel, in giving them victory over all these kings,
and possession of all these kingdoms, and what obligations he hereby
laid upon them to observe his statutes and to keep his laws, [Psa
105:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#044.md), [Psa
105:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#045.md). Here were thirty-one kingdoms,
or seigniories, to be divided among nine tribes and a half of Israel. Of
these there fell to the lot of Judah the kingdoms of Hebron, Jarmuth,
Lachish, Eglon, Debir, Arad, Libnan, and Adullam, eight in all, besides
part of the kingdom of Jerusalem and part of Geder. Benjamin had the
kingdoms of Jericho, Ai, Jerusalem, Makkedah, Beth-el, and the nations
of Gilgal, six in all. Simeon had the kingdom of Hormah and part of
Geder. Ephraim had the kingdoms of Gezer and Tirzah. Manasseh (that
half-tribe) had the kingdoms of Tappuah and Hepher, Taanach and Megiddo.
Asher had the kingdoms of Aphek and Achshaph. Zebulun had the kingdoms
of Lasharon, Shimron-meron, and Jokneam. Naphtali had the kingdoms of
Madon, Hazor, and Kedesh. And Issachar had that of Dor. These were some
of the great and famous kings that God smote, for his mercy endureth for
ever; and gave their land for a heritage, even a heritage unto Israel
his servant, for his mercy endureth for ever, [Psa
136:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#017.md), etc.
