### [Colossians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001.md)

[Colossians](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">col 3:0</span></span>

I. The apostle exhorts us to set our hearts upon heaven and take them
off from this world ([Col 3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001).md). II.
He exhorts to the mortification of sin, in the various instances of it
([Col 3:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005).md). III. He earnestly
presses to mutual love and compassion ([Col
3:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012).md). And concludes with
exhortations to relative duties, of wives and husbands, parents and
children, masters and servants ([Col
3:18-25](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#018).md).

[Colossians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">col 3:1</span></span>

The apostle, having described our privileges by Christ in the former
part of the epistle, and our discharge from the yoke of the ceremonial
law, comes here to press upon us our duty as inferred thence. Though we
are made free from the obligation of the ceremonial law, it does not
therefore follow that we may live as we list. We must walk the more
closely with God in all the instances of evangelical obedience. He
begins with exhorting them to set their hearts on heaven, and take them
off from this world: If you then have risen with Christ. It is our
privilege that we have risen with Christ; that is, have benefit by the
resurrection of Christ, and by virtue of our union and communion with
him are justified and sanctified, and shall be glorified. Hence he
infers that we must seek those things which are above. We must mind the
concerns of another world more than the concerns of this. We must make
heaven our scope and aim, seek the favour of God above, keep up our
communion with the upper world by faith, and hope, and holy love, and
make it our constant care and business to secure our title to and
qualifications for the heavenly bliss. And the reason is because Christ
sits at the right hand of God. He who is our best friend and our head is
advanced to the highest dignity and honour in heaven, and has gone
before to secure to us the heavenly happiness; and therefore we should
seek and secure what he has purchased at so vast an expense, and is
taking so much care about. We must live such a life as Christ lived here
on earth and lives now in heaven, according to our capacities.

I. He explains this duty ([Col 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#002).md):
Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth.
Observe, To seek heavenly things is to set our affections upon them, to
love them and let our desires be towards them. Upon the wings of
affection the heart soars upwards, and is carried forth towards
spiritual and divine objects. We must acquaint ourselves with them,
esteem them above all other things, and lay out ourselves in preparation
for the enjoyment of them. David gave this proof of his loving the house
of God, that he diligently sought after it, and prepared for it, [Psa
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md). This is to be spiritually minded
([Rom 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#006).md), and to seek and desire a
better country, that is, a heavenly, [Heb
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#014.md), [Heb
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016.md). Things on earth are here set in
opposition to things above. We must not dote upon them, nor expect too
much from them, that we may set our affections on heaven; for heaven and
earth are contrary one to the other, and a supreme regard to both is
inconsistent; and the prevalence of our affection to one will
proportionably weaken and abate our affection to the other.

II\. He assigns three reasons for this, [Col
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003.md), [Col
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004.md).

1\. That we are dead; that is, to present things, and as our portion. We
are so in profession and obligation; for we are buried with Christ, and
planted into the likeness of his death. Every Christian is crucified
unto the world, and the world is crucified unto him, [Gal
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#014.md). And if we are dead to the earth,
and have renounced it as our happiness, it is absurd for us to set our
affections upon it, and seek it. We should be like a dead thing to it,
unmoved and unaffected towards it.

2\. Our true life lies in the other world: You are dead, and your life
is hid with Christ in God, [Col 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003.md).
The new man has its livelihood thence. It is born and nourished from
above; and the perfection of its life is reserved for that state. It is
hid with Christ; not hid from us only, in point of secrecy, but hid for
us, denoting security. The life of a Christian is hid with Christ.
Because I live you shall live also, [Joh
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#019.md). Christ is at present a hidden
Christ, or one whom we have not seen; but this is our comfort, that our
life is hid with him, and laid up safely with him. As we have reason to
love him whom we have not seen ([Pe1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#008).md), so we may take the comfort of a
happiness out of sight, and reserved in heaven for us.

3\. Because at the second coming of Christ we hope for the perfection of
our happiness. If we live a life of Christian purity and devotion now,
when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, we shall also appear with
him in glory, [Col 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004). Observe, (1..md)
Christ is a believer's life. I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me,
[Gal 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020.md). He is the principle and end
of the Christian's life. He lives in us by his Spirit, and we live to
him in all we do. To me to live is Christ, [Phi
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#021). (2..md) Christ will appear again.
He is now hid; and the heavens must contain him; but he will appear in
all the pomp of the upper world, with his holy angels, and in his own
glory and his Father's glory, [Mar
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#038.md); [Luk
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#026). (3..md) We shall then appear with
him in glory. It will be his glory to have his redeemed with him; he
will come to be glorified in his saints ([Th2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#010).md); and it will be their glory to
come with him, and be with him for ever. At the second coming of Christ
there will be a general meeting of all the saints; and those whose life
is now hid with Christ shall then appear with Christ in that glory which
he himself enjoys, [Joh 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024.md). Do we
look for such a happiness, and should we not set our affections upon
that world, and live above this? What is there here to make us fond of
it? What is there not there to draw our hearts to it? Our head is there,
our home is there, our treasure is there, and we hope to be there for
ever.

[Colossians 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">col 3:5</span></span>

The apostle exhorts the Colossians to the mortification of sin, the
great hindrance to seeking the things which are above. Since it is our
duty to set our affections upon heavenly things, it is our duty to
mortify our members which are upon the earth, and which naturally
incline us to the things of the world: "Mortify them, that is, subdue
the vicious habits of mind which prevailed in your Gentile state. Kill
them, suppress them, as you do weeds or vermin which spread and destroy
all about them, or as you kill an enemy who fights against you and
wounds you." - Your members which are upon the earth; either the members
of the body, which are the earthly part of us, and were curiously
wrought in the lower parts of the earth ([Psa
139:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#015).md), or the corrupt affections of
the mind, which lead us to earthly things, the members of the body of
death, [Rom 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#024.md). He specifies,

I. The lusts of the flesh, for which they were before so very
remarkable: Fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil
concupiscence - the various workings of the carnal appetites and fleshly
impurities, which they indulged in their former course of life, and
which were so contrary to the Christian state and the heavenly hope.

II\. The love of the world: And covetousness, which is idolatry; that
is, an inordinate love of present good and outward enjoyments, which
proceeds from too high a value in the mind, puts upon too eager a
pursuit, hinders the proper use and enjoyment of them, and creates
anxious fear and immoderate sorrow for the loss of them. Observe,
Covetousness is spiritual idolatry: it is the giving of that love and
regard to worldly wealth which are due to God only, and carries a
greater degree of malignity in it, and is more highly provoking to God,
than is commonly thought. And it is very observable that among all the
instances of sin which good men are recorded in the scripture to have
fallen into (and there is scarcely any but some or other, in one or
other part of their life, have fallen into) there is no instance in all
the scripture of any good man charged with covetousness. He proceeds to
show how necessary it is to mortify sins, [Col
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#006.md), [Col
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#007.md). 1. Because, if we do not kill
them, they will kill us: For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh
on the children of disobedience, [Col
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#006.md). See what we are all by nature
more or less: we are children of disobedience: not only disobedient
children, but under the power of sin and naturally prone to disobey. The
wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray as soon as they are
born, speaking lies, [Psa 58:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#003.md). And,
being children of disobedience, we are children of wrath, [Eph
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003.md). The wrath of God comes upon all
the children of disobedience. Those who do not obey the precepts of the
law incur the penalties of it. The sins he mentions were their sins in
their heathen and idolatrous state, and they were then especially the
children of disobedience; and yet these sins brought judgments upon
them, and exposed them to the wrath of God. 2. We should mortify these
sins because they have lived in us: In which you also walked some time,
when you lived in them, [Col 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#007.md).
Observe, The consideration that we have formerly lived in sin is a good
argument why we should now forsake it. We have walked in by-paths,
therefore let us walk in them no more. If I have done iniquity, I will
do no more, [Job 34:32](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#032.md). The time past
our lives may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when
we walked in lasciviousness, [Pe1 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#003.md).
- When you lived among those who did such things (so some understand
it), then you walked in those evil practices. It is a hard thing to live
among those who do the works of darkness and not have fellowship with
them, as it is to walk in the mire and contract no soil. Let us keep out
of the way of evil-doers.

[Colossians 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">col 3:8</span></span>

As we are to mortify inordinate appetites, so we are to mortify
inordinate passions ([Col 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#008).md): But
now you also put off all these, anger wrath, malice; for these are
contrary to the design of the gospel, as well as grosser impurities;
and, though they are more spiritual wickedness, have not less malignity
in them. The gospel religion introduces a change of the higher as well
as the lower powers of the soul, and supports the dominion of right
reason and conscience over appetite and passion. Anger and wrath are
bad, but malice is worse, because it is more rooted and deliberate; it
is anger heightened and settled. And, as the corrupt principles in the
heart must be cut off, so the product of them in the tongue; as
blasphemy, which seems there to mean, not so much speaking ill of God as
speaking ill of men, giving ill language to them, or raising ill reports
of them, and injuring their good name by any evil arts, - filthy
communication, that is, all lewd and wanton discourse, which comes from
a polluted mind in the speaker and propagates the same defilements in
the hearers, - and lying: Lie not one to another ([Col
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#009).md), for it is contrary both to the
law of truth and the law of love, it is both unjust and unkind, and
naturally tends to destroy all faith and friendship among mankind. Lying
makes us like the devil (who is the father of lies), and is a prime part
of the devil's image upon our souls; and therefore we are cautioned
against this sin by this general reason: Seeing you have put off the old
man with his deeds, and have put on the new man, [Col
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010.md). The consideration that we have
by profession put away sin and espoused the cause and interest of
Christ, that we have renounced all sin and stand engaged to Christ,
should fortify us against this sin of lying. Those who have put off the
old man have put it off with its deeds; and those who have put on the
new man must put on all its deeds - not only espouse good principles but
act them in a good conversation. The new man is said to be renewed in
knowledge, because an ignorant soul cannot be a good soul. Without
knowledge the heart cannot be good, [Pro
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#002.md). The grace of God works upon the
will and affections by renewing the understanding. Light is the first
thing in the new creation, as it was in the first: after the image of
him who created him. It was the honour of man in innocence that he was
made after the image of God; but that image was defaced and lost by sin,
and is renewed by sanctifying grace: so that a renewed soul is something
like what Adam was in the day he was created. In the privilege and duty
of sanctification there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor
uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free, [Col
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#011.md). There is now no difference
arising from different country or different condition and circumstance
of life: it is as much the duty of the one as of the other to be holy,
and as much the privilege of the one as of the other to receive from God
the grace to be so. Christ came to take down all partition-walls, that
all might stand on the same level before God, both in duty and
privilege. And for this reason, because Christ is all in all. Christ is
a Christian's all, his only Lord and Saviour, and all his hope and
happiness. And to those who are sanctified, one as well as another and
whatever they are in other respects, he is all in all, the Alpha and
Omega, the beginning and the end: he is all in all things to them.

[Colossians 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">col 3:12</span></span>

The apostle proceeds to exhort to mutual love and compassion: Put on
therefore bowels of mercy, [Col 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012.md).
We must not only put off anger and wrath (as [Col
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#008).md), but we must put on compassion
and kindness; not only cease to do evil, but learn to do well; not only
not do hurt to any, but do what good we can to all.

I. The argument here used to enforce the exhortation is very affecting:
Put on, as the elect of God, holy and beloved. Observe, 1. Those who are
holy are the elect of God; and those who are the elect of God, and holy,
are beloved - beloved of God, and ought to be so of all men. 2. Those
who are the elect of God, holy and beloved, ought to conduct themselves
in every thing as becomes them, and so as not to lose the credit of
their holiness, nor the comfort of their being chosen and beloved. It
becomes those who are holy towards God to be lowly and loving towards
all men. Observe, What we must put on in particular. (1.) Compassion
towards the miserable: Bowels of mercy, the tenderest mercies. Those who
owe so much to mercy ought to be merciful to all who are proper objects
of mercy. Be you merciful, as your Father is merciful, [Luk
6:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#036). (2..md) Kindness towards our
friends, and those who love us. A courteous disposition becomes the
elect of God; for the design of the gospel is not only to soften the
minds of men, but to sweeten them, and to promote friendship among men
as well as reconciliation with God. (3.) Humbleness of mind, in
submission to those above us, and condescension to those below us. There
must not only be a humble demeanour, but a humble mind. Learn of me, for
I am meek and lowly in heart, [Mat
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029). (4..md) Meekness towards those who
have provoked us, or been any way injurious to us. We must not be
transported into any indecency by our resentment of indignities and
neglects: but must prudently bridle our own anger, and patiently bear
the anger of others. (5.) Long-suffering towards those who continue to
provoke us. Charity suffereth long, as well as is kind, [Co1
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#004.md). Many can bear a short
provocation who are weary of bearing when it grows long. But we must
suffer long both the injuries of men and the rebukes of divine
Providence. If God is long-suffering to us, under all our provocations
of him, we should exercise long-suffering to others in like cases. (6.)
Mutual forbearance, in consideration of the infirmities and deficiencies
under which we all labour: Forbearing one another. We have all of us
something which needs to be borne with, and this is a good reason why we
should bear with others in what is disagreeable to us. We need the same
good turn from others which we are bound to show them. (7.) A readiness
to forgive injuries: Forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel
against any. While we are in this world, where there is so much
corruption in our hearts, and so much occasion of difference and
contention, quarrels will sometimes happen, even among the elect of God,
who are holy and beloved, as Paul and Barnabas had a sharp contention,
which parted them asunder one from the other ([Act
15:39](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#039).md), and Paul and Peter, [Gal
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#014.md). But it is our duty to forgive
one another in such cases; not to bear any grudge, but put up with the
affront and pass it by. And the reason is: Even as Christ forgave you,
so also do you. The consideration that we are forgiven by Christ so many
offences is a good reason why we should forgive others. It is an
argument of the divinity of Christ that he had power on earth to forgive
sins; and it is a branch of his example which we are obliged to follow,
if we ourselves would be forgiven. Forgive us our trespasses, as we
forgive those who trespass against us, [Mat
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#012.md).

II\. In order to all this, we are exhorted here to several things: - 1.
To clothe ourselves with love ([Col
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014).md): Above all things put on
charity: epi pasi di toutois - over all things. Let this be the upper
garment, the robe, the livery, the mark of our dignity and distinction.
Or, Let this be principal and chief, as the whole sum and abstract of
the second table. Add to faith virtue, and to brotherly-kindness
charity, [Pe2 1:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005.md). He lays the
foundation in faith, and the top-stone in charity, which is the bond of
perfectness, the cement and centre of all happy society. Christian unity
consists of unanimity and mutual love. 2. To submit ourselves to the
government of the peace of God ([Col
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#015).md): Let the peace of God rule in
your hearts, that is, God's being at peace with you, and the comfortable
sense of his acceptance and favour: or, a disposition to peace among
yourselves, a peaceable spirit, that keeps the peace, and makes peace.
This is called the peace of God, because it is of his working in all who
are his. The kingdom of God is righteousness and peace, [Rom
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017.md). "Let this peace rule in your
heart - prevail and govern there, or as an umpire decide all matters of
difference among you." - To which you are called in one body. We are
called to this peace, to peace with God as our privilege and peace with
our brethren as our duty. Being united in one body, we are called to be
at peace one with another, as the members of the natural body; for we
are the body of Christ, and members in particular, [Co1
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#027.md). To preserve in us this
peaceable disposition, we must be thankful. The work of thanksgiving to
God is such a sweet and pleasant work that it will help to make us sweet
and pleasant towards all men. "Instead of envying one another upon
account of any particular favours and excellence, be thankful for his
mercies, which are common to all of you." 3. To let the word of Christ
dwell in us richly, [Col 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#016.md). The
gospel is the word of Christ, which has come to us; but that is not
enough, it must dwell in us, or keep house - enoikeitō, not as a servant
in a family, who is under another's control, but as a master, who has a
right to prescribe to and direct all under his roof. We must take our
instructions and directions from it, and our portion of meat and
strength, of grace and comfort, in due season, as from the master of the
household. It must dwell in us; that is, be always ready and at hand to
us in every thing, and have its due influence and use. We must be
familiarly acquainted with it, and know it for our good, [Job
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#027.md). It must dwell in us richly: not
only keep house in our hearts, but keep a good house. Many have the word
of Christ dwelling in them, but it dwells in them but poorly; it has no
mighty force and influence upon them. Then the soul prospers when the
word of God dwells in us richly, when we have abundance of it in us, and
are full of the scriptures and of the grace of Christ. And this in all
wisdom. The proper office of wisdom is to apply what we know to
ourselves, for our own direction. The word of Christ must dwell in us,
not in all notion and speculation, to make us doctors, but in all
wisdom, to make us good Christians, and enable us to conduct ourselves
in every thing as becomes Wisdom's children. 4. To teach and admonish
one another. This would contribute very much to our furtherance in all
grace; for we sharpen ourselves by quickening others, and improve our
knowledge by communicating it for their edification. We must admonish
one another in psalms and hymns. Observe, Singing of psalms is a gospel
ordinance: psalmois kai humnois kai ōdais - the Psalms of David, and
spiritual hymns and odes, collected out of the scripture, and suited to
special occasions, instead of their lewd and profane songs in their
idolatrous worship. Religious poesy seems countenanced by these
expressions and is capable of great edification. But, when we sing
psalms, we make no melody unless we sing with grace in our hearts,
unless we are suitably affected with what we sing and go along in it
with true devotion and understanding. Singing of psalms is a teaching
ordinance as well as a praising ordinance; and we are not only to
quicken and encourage ourselves, but to teach and admonish one another,
mutually excite our affections, and convey instructions. 5. All must be
done in the name of Christ ([Col
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#017).md): And whatsoever you do in word
or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, according to his command
and in compliance with his authority, by strength derived from him, with
an eye to his glory, and depending upon his merit for the acceptance of
what is good and the pardon of what is amiss, Giving thanks to God and
the Father by him. Observe, (1.) We must give thanks in all things;
whatsoever we do, we must still give thanks, [Eph
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#020.md), Giving thanks always for all
things. (2.) The Lord Jesus must be the Mediator of our praises as well
as of our prayers. We give thanks to God and the Father in the name of
the Lord Jesus Christ, [Eph 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#020.md).
Those who do all things in Christ's name will never want matter of
thanksgiving to God, even the Father.

[Colossians 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">col 3:18</span></span>

The apostle concludes the chapter with exhortations to relative duties,
as before in the epistle to the Ephesians. The epistles which are most
taken up in displaying the glory of divine grace, and magnifying the
Lord Jesus, are the most particular and distinct in pressing the duties
of the several relations. We must never separate the privileges and
duties of the gospel religion.

I. He begins with the duties of wives and husbands ([Col
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#018).md): Wives, submit yourselves unto
your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. Submission is the duty of
wives, hupotassesthe. It is the same word which is used to express our
duty to magistrates ([Rom 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001.md), Let
every soul be subject to the higher powers), and is expressed by
subjection and reverence, [Eph 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#024.md),
[Eph 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#033.md). The reason is that Adam was
first formed, then Eve: and Adam was not deceived, but the woman, being
deceived, was in the transgression, [Ti1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#013.md), [Ti1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#014.md). He was first in the creation and
last in the transgression. The head of the woman is the man; and the man
is not of the woman, but the woman of the man; neither was the man
created for the woman, but the woman for the man, [Co1
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#003.md), [Co1
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#008.md), [Co1
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#009.md). It is agreeable to the order of
nature and the reason of things, as well as the appointment and will of
God. But then it is submission, not to a rigorous lord or absolute
tyrant, who may do his will and is without restraints, but to a husband,
and to her own husband, who stands in the nearest relation, and is under
strict engagements to proper duty too. And this is fit in the Lord, it
is becoming the relation, and what they are bound in duty to do, as an
instance of obedience to the authority and law of Christ. On the other
hand, husbands must love their wives, and not be bitter against them,
[Col 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#019.md). They must love them with
tender and faithful affection, as Christ loved the church, and as their
own bodies, and even as themselves ([Eph
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025.md), [Eph
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#028.md), [Eph
5:33](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#033).md), with a love peculiar to the
nearest relation and the greatest comfort and blessing of life. And they
must not be bitter against them, not use them unkindly, with harsh
language or severe treatment, but be kind and obliging to them in all
things; for the woman was made for the man, neither is the man without
the woman, and the man also is by the woman, [Co1
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#009.md), [Co1
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#011.md), [Co1
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#012.md).

II\. The duties of children and parents: Children, obey your parents in
all things, for this is well-pleasing unto the Lord, [Col
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#020.md). They must be willing to do all
their lawful commands, and be at their direction and disposal; as those
who have a natural right and are fitter to direct them than themselves.
The apostle ([Eph 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#002).md) requires them
to honour as well as obey their parents; they must esteem them and think
honourably of them, as the obedience of their lives must proceed from
the esteem and opinion of their minds. And this is well-pleasing to God,
or acceptable to him; for it is the first commandment with promise ([Eph
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#002).md), with an explicit promise annexed
to it, namely, That it shall be well with them, and they shall live long
on the earth. Dutiful children are the most likely to prosper in the
world and enjoy long life. And parents must be tender, as well as
children obedient ([Col 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#021).md):
"Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.
Let not your authority over them be exercised with rigour and severity,
but with kindness and gentleness, lest you raise their passions and
discourage them in their duty, and by holding the reins too tight make
them fly out with greater fierceness." The bad temper and example of
imprudent parents often prove a great hindrance to their children and a
stumbling-block in their way; see [Eph
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#004.md). And it is by the tenderness of
parents, and dutifulness of children, that God ordinarily furnishes his
church with a seed to serve him, and propagates religion from age to
age.

III\. Servants and masters: Servants, obey your masters in all things
according to the flesh, [Col 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#022.md).
Servants must do the duty of the relation in which they stand, and obey
their master's commands in all things which are consistent with their
duty to God their heavenly Master. Not with eye-service, as men-pleasers
- not only when their master's eye is upon them, but when they are from
under their master's eye. They must be both just and diligent. In
singleness of heart, fearing God - without selfish designs, or hypocrisy
and disguise, as those who fear God and stand in awe of him. Observe,
The fear of God ruling in the heart will make people good in every
relation. Servants who fear God will be just and faithful when they are
from under their master's eye, because they know they are under the eye
of God. See [Gen 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#011.md), Because I
thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place. [Neh
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#015.md), But so did not I, because of the
fear of God. "And whatsoever you do, do it heartily ([Col
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#023).md), with diligence, not idly and
slothfully:" or, "Do it cheerfully, not discontented at the providence
of God which put you in that relation." - As to the Lord, and not as to
men. It sanctifies a servant's work when it is done as unto God - with
an eye to his glory and in obedience to his command, and not merely as
unto men, or with regard to them only. Observe, We are really doing our
duty to God when we are faithful in our duty to men. And, for servants'
encouragement, let them know that a good and faithful servant is never
the further from heaven for his being a servant: "Knowing that of the
Lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance, for you serve the
Lord Christ, [Col 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#024.md). Serving your
masters according to the command of Christ, you serve Christ, and he
will be your paymaster: you will have a glorious reward at last. Though
you are now servants, you will receive the inheritance of sons. But, on
the other hand, He who does wrong will receive for the wrong which he
has done," [Col 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#025.md). There is a
righteous God, who, if servants wrong their masters, will reckon with
them for it, though they may conceal it from their master's notice. And
he will be sure to punish the unjust as well as reward the faithful
servant: and so if masters wrong their servants. - And there is no
respect of persons with him. The righteous Judge of the earth will be
impartial, and carry it with an equal hand towards the master and
servant; not swayed by any regard to men's outward circumstances and
condition of life. The one and the other will stand upon a level at his
tribunal.

It is probable that the apostle has a particular respect, in all these
instances of duty, to the case mentioned 1 Cor. 7 of relations of a
different religion, as a Christian and heathen, a Jewish convert and an
uncircumcised Gentile, where there was room to doubt whether they were
bound to fulfil the proper duties of their several relations to such
persons. And, if it hold in such cases, it is much stronger upon
Christians one towards another, and where both are of the same religion.
And how happy would the gospel religion make the world, if it every
where prevailed; and how much would it influence every state of things
and every relation of life!
