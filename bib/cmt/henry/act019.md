### [Acts Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001.md)

[Acts](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">act 19:0</span></span>

We left Paul in his circuit visiting the churches ([Act
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#023).md), but we have not forgotten, nor
has he, the promise he made to his friends at Ephesus, to return to
them, and make some stay there; now this chapter shows us his
performance of that promise, his coming to Ephesus, and his continuance
there two years; we are here told, I. How he laboured there in the word
and doctrine, how he taught some weak believers that had gone no further
than John's baptism ([Act 19:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001).md), how
he taught three months in the synagogue of the Jews ([Act
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#008).md), and, when he was driven thence,
how he taught the Gentiles a long time in a public school ([Act
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#009.md), [Act
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#010).md), and how he confirmed his
doctrine by miracles ([Act 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#011.md), [Act
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#012).md). II. What was the fruit of his
labour, particularly among the conjurors, the worst of sinners: some
were confounded, that did but make use of his name ([Act
19:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#013).md), but others were converted,
that received and embraced his doctrine ([Act
19:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#018).md). III. What projects he had
of further usefulness ([Act 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021.md),
[Act 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022).md), and what trouble at
length he met with at Ephesus from the silversmiths, which forced him
thence to pursue the measures he had laid; how a mob was raised by
Demetrius to cry up Diana ([Act
19:23-34](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#023).md), and how it was suppressed
and dispersed by the town-clerk ([Act
19:35-41](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#035).md).

[Acts 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 19:1</span></span>

Ephesus was a city of great note in Asia, famous for a temple built
there to Diana, which was one of the wonders of the world: thither Paul
came to preach the gospel while Apollos was at Corinth ([Act
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001).md); while he was watering there,
Paul was planting here, and grudged not that Apollos entered into his
labours and was building upon his foundation, but rejoiced in it, and
went on in the new work that was cut out for him at Ephesus with the
more cheerfulness and satisfaction, because he knew that such an able
minister of the New Testament as Apollos was now at Corinth, carrying on
the good work there. Though there were those that made him the head of a
party against Paul ([Co1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012).md), yet
Paul had no jealousy of him, nor any way disliked the affection the
people had for him. Paul having gone through the country of Galatia and
Phrygia, having passed through the upper coasts, Pontus and Bithynia,
that lay north, at length came to Ephesus, where he had left Aquila and
Priscilla, and there found them. At his first coming, he met with some
disciples there, who professed faith in Christ as the true Messiah, but
were as yet in the first and lowest form in the school of Christ, under
his usher John the Baptist. They were in number about twelve ([Act
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#007).md); they were much of the standing
that Apollos was of when he came to Ephesus (for he knew only the
baptism of John, [Act 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#025).md), but they
had not opportunity of being acquainted with Aquila and Priscilla, or
had not been so long in Ephesus or were not so willing to receive
instruction as Apollos was, otherwise they might have had the way of God
expounded to them more perfectly, as Apollos had. Observe here,

I. How Paul catechised them. He was told, probably by Aquila and
Priscilla, that they were believers, that they did own Christ, and had
given up their names to him; now Paul hereupon takes them under
examination.

1\. They did believe in the Son of God; but Paul enquires whether they
had received the Holy Ghost, - whether they believed in the spirit,
whose operations on the minds of men, for conviction, conversion, and
comfort, were revealed some time after the doctrine of Jesus being the
Christ, - whether they had been acquainted with, and had admitted, this
revelation? This was not all; extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost were
conferred upon the apostles and other disciples presently after Christ's
ascension, which was frequently repeated upon occasion; had they
participated in these gifts? "Have you received the Holy Ghost since you
believed? Have you had that seal of the truth of Christ's doctrine in
yourselves?" We are not now to expect any such extraordinary gifts as
they had then. The canon of the New Testament being long since completed
and ratified, we depend upon that as the most sure word of prophecy. But
there are graces of the Spirit given to all believers, which are as
earnests to them, [Co2 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#022.md); [Co2
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#005.md); [Eph
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013.md), [Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014.md). Now it concerns us all who
profess the Christian faith seriously to enquire whether we have
received the Holy Ghost or not. The Holy Ghost is promised to all
believers, to all petitioners ([Luk
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#013).md); but many are deceived in this
matter, thinking they have received the Holy Ghost when really they have
not. As there are pretenders to the gifts of the Holy Ghost, so there
are to his graces and comforts; we should therefore strictly examine
ourselves, Have we received the Holy Ghost since we believed? The tree
will be known by its fruits. Do we bring forth the fruits of the Spirit?
Are we led by the Spirit? Do we walk in the Spirit? Are we under the
government of the Spirit?

2\. They owned their ignorance in this matter: "Whether there be a Holy
Ghost is more than we know. That there is a promise of the Holy Ghost we
know from the scriptures of the Old Testament, and that this promise
will be fulfilled in its season we doubt not; but so much have we been
out of the way of intelligence in this matter that we have not so much
as heard whether the Holy Ghost be indeed yet given as a spirit of
prophecy." They knew (as Dr. Lightfoot observes) that, according to the
tradition of their nation, after the death of Ezra, Haggai, Zechariah,
and Malachi, the Holy Ghost departed from Israel, and went up; and they
professed that they had never heard of his return. They spoke as if they
expected it, and wondered they did not hear of it, and were ready to
welcome the notice of it. The gospel light, like that of the morning,
shone more and more, gradually; not only clearer and clearer, in the
discovery of truths not before heard of, but further and further, in the
discovery of them to persons that had not before heard of them.

3\. Paul enquired how they came to be baptized, if they knew nothing of
the Holy Ghost; for, if they were baptized by any of Christ's ministers,
they were instructed concerning the Holy Ghost, and were baptized in his
name. "Know you not that Jesus being glorified, consequently the Holy
Ghost is given? unto what then were you baptized? This is strange and
unaccountable. What! baptized, and yet know nothing of the Holy Ghost?
Surely your baptism was a nullity, if you know nothing of the Holy
Ghost; for it is the receiving of the Holy Ghost that is signified and
sealed by that washing of regeneration. Ignorance of the Holy Ghost is
as inconsistent with a sincere profession of Christianity as ignorance
of Christ is." Applying it to ourselves, it intimates that those are
baptized to no purpose, and have received the grace of God therein in
vain, that do not receive and submit to the Holy Ghost. It is also an
enquiry we should often make, not only to whose honour we were born, but
into whose service we were baptized, that we may study to answer the
ends both of our birth and of our baptism. Let us often consider unto
what we were baptized, that we may live up to our baptism.

4\. They own that they were baptized unto John's baptism - eis to
Iōannou baptisma that is, as I take it, they were baptized in the name
of John, not by John himself (he was far enough from any such thought),
but by some weak, well-meaning disciple of his, that ignorantly kept up
his name as the head of a party, retaining the spirit and notion of
those disciples of his that were jealous of the growth of Christ's
interest, and complained to him of it, [Joh
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#026.md). Some one or more of these, that
found themselves much edified by John's baptism of repentance for the
remission of sins, not thinking that the kingdom of heaven, which he
spoke of as at hand, was so very near as it proved, ran away with that
notion, rested in what they had, and thought they could not do better
than to persuade others to do so too; and so, ignorantly, in a blind
zeal for John's doctrine, they baptized here and there one in John's
name, or, as it is here expressed, unto John's baptism, looking no
further themselves, nor directing those that they baptized any further.

5\. Paul explains to them the true intent and meaning of John's baptism,
as principally referring to Jesus Christ, and so rectifies the mistake
of those who had baptized them into the baptism of John, and had not
directed them to look any further, but to rest in that. Those that have
been left in ignorance, or led into error, by any infelicities of their
education, should not therefore be despised nor rejected by those who
are more knowing and orthodox, but should be compassionately instructed,
and better taught, as these disciples were by Paul. (1.) He owns that
John's baptism was a very good thing, as far as it went: John verily
baptized with the baptism of repentance. By this baptism he required
people to be sorry for their sins, and to confess them and turn from
them; and to bring any to this is a great point gained. But, (2.) He
shows them that John's baptism had a further reference, and he never
designed that those he baptized should rest there, but told them that
they should believe on him who should come after him, that is, on Christ
Jesus, - that his baptism of repentance was designed only to prepare the
way of the Lord, and to dispose them to receive and entertain Christ,
whom he left them big with expectations of; nay, whom he directed them
to: Behold the Lamb of God. "John was a great and good man; but he was
only the harbinger, - Christ is the Prince. His baptism was the porch
which you were to pass through, not the house you were to rest in; and
therefore it was all wrong for you to be baptized into the baptism of
John."

6\. When they were thus shown the error they were led into, they
thankfully accepted the discovery, and were baptized in the name of the
Lord Jesus, [Act 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#005.md). As for Apollos,
of whom it was said ([Act 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#025).md) that
he knew the baptism of John - that he rightly understood the meaning of
it when he was baptized with it, though he knew that only - yet, when he
understood the way of God more perfectly, he was no again baptized, any
more than Christ's first disciples that had been baptized with John's
baptism and knew it referred to the Messiah at the door (and, with an
eye to this, submitted to it), were baptized again. But to these
disciples, who received it only with an eye to John and looked no
further, as if he were their saviour, it was such a fundamental error as
was as fatal to it as it would have been for any to be baptized in the
name of Paul ([Co1 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#013).md); and
therefore, when they came to understand things better, they desired to
be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus, and were so: not by Paul
himself, as we have reason to think, but by some of those who attended
him. It does not therefore follow hence that there was not an agreement
between John's baptism and Christ's, or that they were not for substance
the same; much less does it follow that those who have been once
baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost (which is the
appointed form of Christ's baptism), may be again baptized in the same
name; for those that were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus had
never been so baptized before.

II\. How Paul conferred the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost upon
them, [Act 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#006.md). 1. Paul solemnly
prayed to God to give them those gifts, signified by his laying his
hands on them, which was a gesture used in blessing by the patriarchs,
especially in conveying the great trust of the promise, as [Gen
48:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#014.md). The Spirit being the great
promise of the New Testament, the apostles conveyed it by the imposition
of hands: "The Lord bless thee with that blessing, that blessing of
blessings," [Isa 44:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003.md). 2. God granted
the thing he prayed for: The Holy Ghost came upon them in a surprising
overpowering manner, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied, as the
apostles did and the first Gentile converts, [Act
10:44](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#044.md). This was intended to introduce
the gospel at Ephesus, and to awaken in the minds of men an expectation
of some great things from it; and some think that it was further
designed to qualify these twelve men for the work of the ministry, and
that these twelve were the elders of Ephesus, to whom Paul committed the
care and government of that church. They had the Spirit of prophesy,
that they might understand the mysteries of the kingdom of God
themselves, and the gift of tongues, that they might preach them to
every nation and language. Oh, what a wonderful change was here made on
a sudden in these men! those that but just now had not so much as heard
that there was any Holy Ghost are now themselves filled with the Holy
Ghost; for the Spirit, like the wind, blows where and when he listeth.

[Acts 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 19:8</span></span>

Paul is here very busy at Ephesus to do good.

I. He begins, as usual, in the Jews' synagogue, and makes the first
offer of the gospel to them, that he might gather in the lost sheep of
the house of Israel, who were now scattered upon the mountains. Observe,

1\. Where he preached to them: in their synagogue ([Act
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#008).md), as Christ used to do. He went
and joined them in their synagogue-worship, to take off their prejudices
against him, and to ingratiate himself with them, while there was any
hope of winning upon them. Thus he would bear his testimony to public
worship on sabbath days. Where there were no Christian assemblies yet
formed, he frequented the Jewish assemblies, while the Jews were not as
yet wholly cast off. Paul went into the synagogue, because there he had
them together, and had them, it might be hoped, in a good frame.

2\. What he preached to them: The things concerning the kingdom of God
among men, the great things which concerned God's dominion over all men
and favour to them, and men's subjection to God and happiness in God. He
showed them their obligations to God and interest in him, as the
Creator, by which the kingdom of God was set up, - the violation of
those obligations, and the forfeiture of that interest, by sin, by which
the kingdom of God was pulled down, - and the renewing of those
obligations and the restoration of man to that interest again, by the
Redeemer, whereby the kingdom of God was again set up. Or, more
particularly, the things concerning the kingdom of the Messiah, which
the Jews were in expectation of, and promised themselves great matters
from; he opened the scriptures which spoke concerning this, gave them a
right notion of this kingdom, and showeth them their mistakes about it.

3\. How he preached to them. (1.) He preached argumentatively: he
disputed; gave reasons, scripture-reasons, for what he preached, and
answered objections, for the convincing of men's judgments and
consciences, that they might not only believe, but might see cause to
believe. He preached dialegomenos - dialogue-wise; he put questions to
them and received their answers, gave them leave to put questions to him
and answered them. (2.) He preached affectionately: he persuaded; he
used not only logical arguments, to enforce what he said upon their
understandings, but rhetorical motives, to impress what he said upon
their affections, showing them that the things he preached concerning
the kingdom of God were things concerning themselves, which they were
nearly concerned in, and therefore ought to concern themselves about,
[Co2 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#011.md), We persuade men. Paul was a
moving preacher, and was a master of the art of persuasion. (3.) He
preached undauntedly, and with a holy resolution: he spoke boldly, as
one that had not the least doubt of the things he spoke of, nor the
least distrust of him he spoke fRom. nor the least dread of those he
spoke to.

4\. How long he preached to them: For the space of three months, which
was a competent time allowed them to consider of it; in that time among
them that belonged to the election of grace were called in, and the rest
were left inexcusable. Thus long Paul preached the gospel with much
contention ([Th1 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#002).md), yet he did not
fail, nor was discouraged.

5\. What success his preaching had among them. (1.) There were some that
were persuaded to believe in Christ; some think this is intimated in the
word persuading - he prevailed with them. But, (2.) Many continued in
their infidelity, and were confirmed in their prejudices against
Christianity. When Paul called on them before, and preached only some
general things to them, they courted his stay among them ([Act
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#020).md); but now that he settled among
them, and his word came more closely to their consciences, they were
soon weary of him. \[1.\] They had an invincible aversion to the gospel
of Christ themselves: they were hardened, and believed not; they were
resolved they would not believe, though the truth shone in their faces
with ever such a convincing light and evidence. Therefore they believed
not, because they were hardened. \[2.\] They did their utmost to raise
and keep up in others an aversion to the gospel; they not only entered
not into the kingdom of God themselves, but neither did they suffer
those that were entering to go in; for they spoke evil of that way
before the multitude, to prejudice them against it. Though they could
not show any manner of evil in it, yet they said all manner of evil
concerning it. These sinners, like the angels that sinned, became
Satans, adversaries and devils, false accusers.

II\. When he had carried the matter as far as it would go in the
synagogue of the Jews, and found that their opposition grew more
obstinate, he left the synagogue, because he could not safely, or rather
because he could not comfortably and successfully, continue in communion
with them. Though their worship was such as he could join in, and they
had not silenced him, nor forbidden him to preach among them, yet they
drove him from them by their railing at those things which he spoke
concerning the kingdom of God: they hated to be reformed, hated to be
instructed, and therefore he departed from them. Here we are sure there
was a separation and no schism; for there was a just cause for it and a
clear call to it. Now observe,

1\. When Paul departed from the Jews he took the disciples with him, and
separated them, to save them from that untoward generation (according to
the charge Peter gave to his new converts, [Act
2:40](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#040).md); lest they should be infected
with the poisonous tongues of those blasphemers, he separated those who
believed, to be the foundation of a Christian church, now that they were
a competent number to be incorporated, that others might attend with
them upon the preaching of the gospel, and might, upon their believing,
be added to them. When Paul departed there needed no more to separate
the disciples; let him go where he will, they will follow him.

2\. When Paul separated from the synagogue he set up a meeting of his
own, he disputed daily in the school of one Tyrannus. He left the
synagogue of the Jews, that he might go on with the more freedom in his
work; still he disputed for Christ and Christianity, and was ready to
answer all opponents whatsoever in defence of them; and he had by this
separation a double advantage. (1.) That now his opportunities were more
frequent. In the synagogue he could only preach every sabbath day ([Act
13:42](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#042).md), but now he disputed daily, he
set up a lecture every day, and thus redeemed time: those whose business
would not permit them to come one day might come another day; and those
were welcome who watched daily at these gates of wisdom, and waited
daily at the posts of her doors. (2.) That now they were more open. To
the synagogue of the Jews none might come, nor could come, but Jews or
proselytes; Gentiles were excluded; but, when he set up a meeting in the
school of Tyrannus, both Jews and Greeks attended his ministry, v. 10.
Thus, as he describes this gate of opportunity at Ephesus ([Co1
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008.md), [Co1
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009).md), a wide door and an effectual
was opened to him, though there were many adversaries. Some think this
school of Tyrannus was a divinity-school of the Jews, and such a one
they commonly had in their great cities besides their synagogue; they
called it Bethmidrash, the house of enquiry, or of repetition; and they
went to that on the sabbath day, after they had been in the synagogue.
They go from strength to strength, from the house of the sanctuary to
the house of doctrine. If this was such a school, it shows that though
Paul left the synagogue he left it gradually, and still kept as near it
as he could, as he had done, [Act
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#007.md). But others think it was a
philosophy-school of the Gentiles, belonging to one Tyrannus, or a
retiring place (for so the word scholē sometimes signifies) belonging to
a principal man or governor of the city; some convenient place it was,
which Paul and the disciples had the use of, either for love or money.

3\. Here he continued his labours for two years, read his lectures and
disputed daily. These two years commence from the end of the three
months which he spent in the synagogue ([Act
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#008).md); after they were ended, he
continued for some time in the country about, preaching; therefore he
might justly reckon it in all three years, as he does, [Act
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031.md).

4\. The gospel hereby spread far and near ([Act
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#010).md): All those that dwelt in Asia
heard the word of the Lord Jesus; not only all that dwelt in Ephesus,
but all that dwelt in that large province called Asia, of which Ephesus
was the head city - Asia the Less it was called. There was great resort
to Ephesus from all parts of the country, for law, traffic, religion,
and education, which gave Paul an opportunity of sending the report of
the gospel to all the towns and villages of that country. They all heard
the word of the Lord Jesus. The gospel is Christ's word, it is a word
concerning Christ. This they heard, or at least heard of it. Some of all
sects, some out of all parts both in city and country, embraced this
gospel, and entertained it, and by them it was communicated to others;
and so they all heard the word of the Lord Jesus, or might have heard
it. Probably Paul sometimes made excursions himself into the country, to
preach the gospel, or sent his missionaries or assistants that attended
him, and thus the word of the Lord was heard throughout that region. Now
those that sat in darkness saw a great light.

III\. God confirmed Paul's doctrine by miracles, which awakened people's
enquiries after it, fixed their affection to it, and engaged their
belief of it, [Act 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#011.md), [Act
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#012.md). I wonder we have not read of
any miracle wrought by Paul since the casting of the evil spirit out of
the damsel at Philippi; why did he not work miracles at Thessalonica,
Berea, and Athens? Or, if he did, why are they not recorded? Was the
success of the gospel, without miracles in the kingdom of nature, itself
such a miracle in the kingdom of grace, and the divine power which went
along with it such a proof of its divine original, that there needed no
other? It is certain that at Corinth he wrought many miracles, though
Luke has recorded none, for he tells them ([Co2
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#012).md) that the signs of his
apostleship were among them, in wonders and mighty deeds. But here at
Ephesus we have a general account of the proofs of this kind which he
gave his divine mission. 1. They were special miracles - Dunameis ou
tuchousas. God exerted powers that were not according to the common
course of nature: Virtutes non vulgares. Things were done which could by
no means be ascribed either to chance or second causes. Or, they were
not only (as all miracles are) out of the common road, but they were
even uncommon miracles, such miracles as had not been wrought by the
hands of any other of the apostles. The opposers of the gospel were so
prejudiced that any miracles would not serve their turn; therefore God
wrought virtutes non quaslibet (so they render it), something above the
common road of miracles. 2. It was not Paul that wrought them (What is
Paul, and what is Apollos?) but it was God that wrought them by the hand
of Paul. He was but the instrument, God was the principal agent.

3\. He not only cured the sick that were brought to him, or to whom he
was brought, but from his body were brought to the sick handkerchiefs or
aprons; they got Paul's handkerchiefs, or his aprons, that is, say some,
the aprons he wore when he worked at his trade, and the application of
them to the sick cured them immediately. Or, they brought the sick
people's handkerchiefs, or their girdles, or caps, or head-dresses, and
laid them for awhile to Paul's body, and then took them to the sick. The
former is more probable. Now was fulfilled that word of Christ to his
disciples, Greater works than these shall you do. We read of one that
was cured by the touch of Christ's garment when it was upon him, and he
perceived that virtue went out of him; but here were people cured by
Paul's garments when they were taken from him. Christ gave his apostles
power against unclean spirits and against all manner of sickness ([Mat
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001).md), and accordingly we find here
that those to whom Paul sent relief had it in both those cases: for the
diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them, which
were both significant of the great design and blessed effect of the
gospel, and the healing of spiritual disease, and freeing the souls of
men from the power and dominion of Satan.

[Acts 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 19:13</span></span>

The preachers of the gospel were sent forth to carry on a war against
Satan, and therein Christ went forth conquering and to conquer. The
casting of evil spirits out of those that were possessed was one
instance of Christ's victory over Satan; but, to show in how many ways
Christ triumphed over that great enemy, we have here in these verses two
remarkable instances of the conquest of Satan, not only in those that
were violently possessed by him, but in those that were voluntarily
devoted to him.

I. Here is the confusion of some of Satan's servants, some vagabond
Jews, that were exorcists, who made use of Christ's name profanely and
wickedly in their diabolical enchantments, but were made to pay dearly
for their presumption. Observe,

1\. The general character of those who were guilty of this presumption.
They were Jews, but vagabond Jews, were of the Jewish nation and
religion, but went about from town to town to get money by conjuring.
They strolled about to tell people their fortunes, and pretended by
spells and charms to cure diseases, and bring people to themselves that
were melancholy or distracted. They called themselves exorcists, because
in doing their tricks they used forms of adjuration, by such and such
commanding names. The superstitious Jews, to put a reputation upon these
magic arts, wickedly attributed the invention of them to Solomon. So
Josephus (Antiq. 8.45-46) says that Solomon composed charms by which
diseases were cured, and devils driven out so as never to return; and
that these operations continued common among the Jews to his time. And
Christ seems to refer to this ([Mat
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#027).md), By whom do your children cast
them out?

2\. A particular account of some at Ephesus that led this course of life
and came thither in their travels; they were seven sons of one Sceva, a
Jew, and chief of the priests, [Act
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#014.md). It is sad to see the house of
Jacob thus degenerated, much more the house of Aaron, the family that
was in a peculiar manner consecrated to God; it is truly sad to see any
of that race in league with Satan. Their father was a chief of the
priests, head of one of the twenty-four courses of priests. One would
think the temple would find both employment and encouragement enough for
the sons of a chief priest, if they had been twice as many. But probably
it was a vain, rambling, rakish humour that led them to turn
mountebanks, and wander all the world over to cure mad folks.

3\. The profaneness they were guilty of: They took upon them to call
over evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus; not as those who had a
veneration for Christ and a confidence in his name, as we read of some
who cast out devils in Christ's name and yet did not follow with his
disciples ([Luk 9:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#049).md), whom he would
not have to be discouraged; but as those who were willing to try all
methods to carry on their wicked trade, and, it should seem, had this
design: - If the evil spirits should yield to an adjuration in the name
of Jesus by those that did not believe in him, they would say it was no
confirmation of his doctrine to those that did; for it was all one
whether they believed it or no. If they should not yield to it, they
would say the name of Christ was not so powerful as the other names they
used, to which the devils had often by collusion yielded. They said, We
adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches; not, "whom we believe in, or
depend upon, or have any authority fRom." but whom Paul preaches; as if
they had said, "We will try what that name will do." The exorcists in
the Romish church, who pretend to cast the devil out of melancholy
people by spells and charms which they understand not, and which, not
having any divine warrant, cannot be used in faith, are the followers of
these vagabond Jews.

4\. The confusion they were put to in their impious operations. Let them
not be deceived, God is not mocked, nor shall the glorious name of Jesus
be prostituted to such a vile purpose as this; what communion hath
Christ with Belial? (1.) The evil spirit gave them a sharp reply ([Act
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#015).md): "Jesus I know, and Paul I
know; but who are you? I know that Jesus has conquered principalities
and powers, and that Paul has authority in his name to cast out devils;
but what power have you to command us in his name, or who gave you any
such power? What have you to do to declare the power of Jesus, or to
take his covenant and commands into your mouths, seeing you hate his
instructions?" [Psa 50:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016.md), [Psa
50:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#017.md). This was extorted out of the
mouth of the evil spirit by the power of God, to gain honour to the
gospel, and to put those to shame that made a bad use of Christ's name.
Antichristian powers and factions pretend a mighty zeal for Jesus and
Paul, and to have authority from them; but, when the matter comes to be
looked into, it is a mere worldly secular interest that is to be thus
supported; nay, it is an enmity to true religion: Jesus we know, and
Paul we know; but who are you? (2.) The man in whom the evil spirit was
gave them a warm reception, fell foul upon them, leaped upon them in the
height of his frenzy and rage, overcame them and all their enchantments,
prevailed against them, and was every way too hard for them; so that
they fled out of the house, not only naked, but wounded; their clothes
pulled off their backs, and their heads broken. This is written for a
warning to all those who name the name of Christ, but do not depart from
iniquity. The same enemy that overcomes them with his temptations will
overcome them with his terrors; and their adjuring him in Christ's name
to let them alone will be no security to them. If we resist the devil by
a true and lively faith in Christ, he will flee from us; but if we think
to resist him by the bare using of Christ's name, or any part of his
word, as a spell or charm, he will prevail against us.

5\. The general notice that was taken of this, and the good impression
it made upon many ([Act 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#017).md): This
was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus. It was
the common talk of the town; and the effect of it was, (1.) That men
were terrified: fear fell on them all. In this instance they saw the
malice of the devil whom they served, and the power of Christ whom they
opposed; and both were awful considerations. They saw that the name of
Christ was not to be trifled with, nor his religion compounded with
pagan superstitions. (2.) That God was glorified; the name of the Lord
Jesus, by which his faithful servants cast out devils and cured
diseases, without any resistance, was the more magnified; for now it
appeared to be a name above every name.

II\. Here is the conversion of others of Satan's servants, with the
evidences of their conversion.

1\. Those that had been guilty of wicked practices confessed them, [Act
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#018.md). Many that had believed and were
baptized, but had not then been so particular as they might have been in
the confession of their sins, were so terrified with these instances of
the magnifying of the name of Jesus Christ that they came to Paul, or
some of the other ministers that were with him, and confessed what evil
lives they had led, and what a great deal of secret wickedness their own
consciences charged them with, which the world knew not of - secret
frauds and secret filthiness; they showed their deeds, took shame to
themselves and gave glory to God and warning to others. These
confessions were not extorted from them, but were voluntary, for the
ease of their consciences, upon which the late miracles had struck a
terror. Note, Where there is true contrition for sin there will be an
ingenuous confession of sin to God in every prayer, and to man whom we
have offended when the case requires it.

2\. Those that had conversed with wicked books burnt them ([Act
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#019).md): Many also of those who used
curious arts, ta perierga - impertinent things; multa nihil ad se
pertinentia satagentes - busy bodies (so the word is used, [Th2
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#011.md); [Ti1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#013).md), that traded in the study of
magic and divination, in books of judicial astrology, casting
nativities, telling fortunes, raising and laying spirits, interpreting
dreams, predicting future events, and the like, to which some think are
to be added plays, romances, love-books, and unchaste and immodest poems
- histrionica, amatoria, saltatoria. - Stres. These, having their
consciences more awakened than ever to see the evil of those practices
in which these books instructed them, brought their books together, and
burnt them before all men. Ephesus was notorious for the use of these
curious arts; hence spells and charms were called Literae Ephesiae. Here
people furnished themselves with all those sorts of books, and,
probably, had tutors to instruct them in those black arts. It was
therefore much for the honour of Christ and his gospel to have such a
noble testimony borne against those curious arts, in a place where they
were so much in vogue. It is taken for granted that they were convinced
of the evil of these curious arts, and resolved to deal in them no
longer; but they did not think this enough unless they burnt their
books. (1.) Thus they showed a holy indignation at the sins they had
been guilty of; as the idolaters, when they were brought to repentance,
said to their idols, Get you hence ([Isa
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#022).md), and cast even those of silver
and gold to the moles and to the bats, [Isa
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#020.md). They thus took a pious revenge
on those things that had been the instruments of sin to them, and
proclaimed the force of their convictions of the evil of it, and that
those very things were now detectable to them, as much as ever they had
been delectable. (2.) Thus they showed their resolution never to return
to the use of those arts, and the books which related to them, again.
They were so fully convinced of the evil and danger of them that they
would not throw the books by, within reach of a recall, upon supposition
that it was possible they might change their mind; but, being stedfastly
resolved never to make use of them, they burnt them. (3.) Thus they put
away a temptation to return to them again. Had they kept the books by
them, there was danger lest, when the heat of the present conviction was
over, they should have the curiosity to look into them, and so be in
danger of liking them and loving them again, and therefore they burnt
them. Note, Those that truly repent of sin will keep themselves as far
as possible from the occasions of it. (4.) Thus they prevented their
doing mischief to others. If Judas had been by he would have said, "Sell
them, and give the money to the poor;" or, "Buy Bibles and good books
with it." But then who could tell into whose hands these dangerous books
might fall, and what mischief might be done by them? it was therefore
the safest course to commit them all to the flames. Those that are
recovered from sin themselves will do all they can to keep others from
falling into it, and will be much more afraid of laying an occasion of
sin in the way of others. (5.) Thus they showed a contempt of the wealth
of this world; for the price of the books was cast up, probably by those
that persuaded them not to burn them, and it was found to be fifty
thousand pieces of silver, which some compute to be fifteen hundred
pounds of our money. It is probable that the books were scarce, perhaps
prohibited, and therefore dear. Probably they had cost them so much;
yet, being the devil's books, though they had been so foolish as to buy
them, they did not think this would justify them in being so wicked as
to sell them again. (6.) Thus they publicly testified their joy for
their conversion from these wicked practices, as Matthew did by the
great feast he made when Christ had called him from the receipt of
custom. These converts joined together in making this bonfire, and made
it before all men. They might have burnt the books privately, every one
in his own house, but they chose to do it together, by consent, and to
do it at the high cross (as we say), that Christ and his grace in them
might be the more magnified, and all about them the more edified.

III\. Here is a general account of the progress and success of the
gospel in and about Ephesus ([Act
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#020).md): So mightily grew the word of
God, and prevailed. It is a blessed sight to see the word of God growing
and prevailing mightily, as it did here. 1. To see it grow extensively,
by the addition of many to the church. When still more and more are
wrought upon by the gospel, and wrought up into a conformity to it, then
it grows; when those that were least likely to yield to it, and that had
been most stiff in their opposition to it, are captivated and brought
into obedience to it, then it may be said to grow mightily. 2. To see it
prevail extensively, by the advancement in knowledge and grace of those
that are added to the church; when strong corruptions are mortified,
vicious habits changed, evil customs of long standing broken off, and
pleasant, gainful, fashionable sins are abandoned, then it prevails
mightily; and Christ in it goes on conquering and to conquer.

[Acts 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 19:21</span></span>

I. Paul is here brought into some trouble at Ephesus, just when he is
forecasting to go thence, and to cut out work for himself elsewhere. See
here,

1\. How he laid his purpose of going to other places, [Act
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021.md), [Act
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022.md). He was a man of vast designs
for God, and was for making his influences as widely diffusive as might
be. Having spent above two years at Ephesus, (1.) He designed a visit to
the churches of Macedonia and Achaia, especially of Philippi and
Corinth, the chief cities of those provinces, [Act
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021.md). There he had planted churches,
and now is concerned to visit them. He purposed in the spirit, either in
his own spirit, not communicating his purpose as yet, but keeping it to
himself; or by the direction of the Holy Spirit, who was his guide in
all his motions, and by whom he was led. He purposed to go and see how
the work of God went on in those places, that he might rectify what was
amiss and encourage what was good. (2.) Thence he designed to go to
Jerusalem, to visit the brethren there, and give an account to them of
the prospering of the good pleasure of the Lord in his hand; and thence
he intended to go to Rome, to go and see Rome; not as if he designed
only the gratifying of his curiosity with the sight of that ancient
famous city, but because it was an expression people commonly used, that
they would go and see Rome, would look about them there, when that which
he designed was to see the Christians there, and to do them some
service, [Rom 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#011.md). The good people at
Rome were the glory of the city which he longed for a sight of. Dr.
Lightfoot supposes that it was upon the death of the emperor Claudius,
who died the second year of Paul's being at Ephesus, that Paul thought
of going to Rome, because while he lived the Jews were forbidden Rome,
[Act 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002). (3..md) He sent Timothy and
Erastus into Macedonia, to give them notice of the visit he intended
them, and to get their collection ready for the poor saints at
Jerusalem. Soon after he wrote the first epistle to the Corinthians,
designing to follow it himself, as appears [Co1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017.md), [Co1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#019.md), I have sent to you Timotheus;
but I will myself come to you shortly, if the Lord will. For the
present, he staid in Asia, in the country about Ephesus, founding
churches.

2\. How he was seconded in his purpose, and obliged to pursue it by the
troubles which at length he met with at Ephesus. It was strange that he
had been quiet there so long; yet it should seem he had met with trouble
there not recorded in this story, for in his epistle written at this
time he speaks of his having fought with beasts at Ephesus ([Co1
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032).md), which seems to be meant of his
being put to fight with wild beasts in the theatre, according to the
barbarous treatment they sometimes gave the Christians. And he speaks of
the trouble which came to them in Asia, near Ephesus, when he despaired
of life, and received a sentence of death within himself, [Co2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#008.md), [Co2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#009.md).

II\. But, in the trouble here related, he was worse frightened than
hurt. In general, there arose no small stir about that way, [Act
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#023.md). Some historians say that the
famous impostor Apollonius Tyanaeus, who set up for a rival with Christ,
and gave out himself, as Simon Magus, to be some great one, was at
Ephesus about this time that Paul was there. But it seems the opposition
he gave to the gospel was so insignificant that St. Luke did not think
it worth taking notice of. The disturbance he gives an account of was of
another nature: let us view the particulars of it. Here is,

1\. A great complaint against Paul and the other preachers of the gospel
for drawing people off from the worship of Diana, and so spoiling the
trade of the silversmiths that worked for Diana's temple.

(1.) The complainant is Demetrius, a silversmith, a principal man, it is
likely, of the trade, and one that would be thought to understand and
consult the interests of it more than others of the company. Whether he
worked in other sorts of plate or no we are not told; but the most
advantageous branch of his trade was making silver shrines for Diana,
[Act 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#024.md). Some think these were
medals stamped with the effigies of Diana, or her temple, or both;
others think they were representations of the temple, with the image of
Diana in it in miniature, all of silver, but so small that people might
carry them about with them, as the papists do their crucifixes. Those
that came from far to pay their devotions at the temple of Ephesus, when
they went home bought these little temples or shrines, to carry home
with them, for the gratifying of the curiosity of their friends, and to
preserve in their own minds the idea of that stately edifice. See how
craftsmen, and crafty men too above the rank of silversmiths, make an
advantage to themselves of people's superstition, and serve their
worldly ends by it.

(2.) The persons he appeals to are not the magistrates, but the mob; he
called the craftsmen together, with the workmen of like occupation (a
company of mechanics, who had no sense of any thing but their worldly
interest), and these he endeavoured to incense against Paul, who would
be actuated as little by reason and as much by fury as he could desire.

(3.) His complaint and representation are very full. \[1.\] He lays it
down for a principle that the art and mystery of making silver shrines
for the worshippers of Diana was very necessary to be supported and kept
up ([Act 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#025).md): "You know that by
this craft we have not only our subsistence, and our necessary food, but
our wealth. We grow rich, and raise estates. We live great, and have
wherewithal to maintain our pleasures; and therefore, whatever comes of
it, we must not suffer this craft to grow into contempt." Note, It is
natural for men to be jealous for that, whether right or wrong, by which
they get their wealth; and many have, for this reason alone, set
themselves against the gospel of Christ, because it calls men off from
those crafts which are unlawful, how much wealth soever is to be
obtained by them. \[2.\] He charges it upon Paul that he had dissuaded
men from worshipping idols. The words, as they are laid in the
indictment, are, that he had asserted, Those are no gods which are made
with hands, [Act 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#026.md). Could any
truth be more plain and self-evident than this, or any reasoning more
cogent and convincing than that of the prophets, The workman made it,
therefore it is not God? The first and most genuine notion we have of
God is, that he had his being of himself, and depends upon none; but
that all things have their being from him, and their dependence on him:
and then it must follow that those are no gods which are the creatures
of men's fancy and the work of men's hands. Yet this must be looked upon
as an heretical and atheistical notion, and Paul as a criminal for
maintaining it; not that they could advance any thing against this
doctrine itself, but that the consequence of it was that not only at
Ephesus, the chief city, but almost throughout all Asia, among the
country people, who were their best customers, and whom they thought
they were surest of, he had persuaded and turned away much people from
the worship of Diana; so that there was not now such a demand for the
silver shrines as had been, nor were such good rates given for them.
There are those who will stickle for that which is most grossly absurd
and unreasonable, and which carries along with it its own conviction of
falsehood, as this does, that those are gods which are made with hands,
if it have but human laws, and worldly interest and prescription, on its
side. \[3.\] He reminds them of the danger which their trade was in of
going to decay. Whatever touches this touches them in a sensible tender
part: "If this doctrine gains credit, we are all undone, and may even
shut up shop; this our craft will be set at nought, will be convicted,
and put into an ill name as superstition, and a cheat upon the world,
and every body will run it down. This our part" (so the word is), "our
interest or share of trade and commerce," kinduneuei hēmin to meros,
"will not only come into danger of being lost, but it will bring us into
danger, and we shall become not only beggars, but malefactors." \[4.\]
He pretends a mighty zeal for Diana, and a jealousy for her honour: Not
only this our craft is in danger; if that were all, he would not have
you think that he would have spoken with so much warmth, but all his
care is lest the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised,
and her magnificence should be destroyed; and he would not, for all the
world, see the diminution of the honour of that goddess, whom all Asia
and the world worship. See what the worship of Diana had to plead for
itself, and what was the utmost which the most zealous bigots for it had
to say in its behalf. First, That it had pomp on its side; the
magnificence of the temple was the thing that charmed them, the thing
that chained them; they could not bear the thoughts of any thing that
tended to the diminution, much less to the destruction, of that.
Secondly, That it had numbers on its side; All Asia and the world
worship it; and therefore it must needs be the right way of worship, let
Paul say what he will to the contrary. Thus, because all the world
wonders after the beast, therefore the dragon, the devil, the god of
this world, gives him his power, and his seat, and great authority, [Rev
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#002.md), [Rev
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#003.md).

2\. The popular resentment of this complaint. The charge was managed by
a craftsman, and was framed to incense the common people, and it had the
desired effect; for on this occasion they showed, (1.) A great
displeasure against the gospel and the preachers of it. They were full
of wrath ([Act 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#028).md), full of fury
and indignation, so the word signifies. The craftsmen went stark mad
when they were told that their trade and their idol were both in danger.
(2.) A great jealousy for the honour of their goddess: They cried out,
"Great is Diana of the Ephesians; and we are resolved to stand by her,
and live and die in the defence of her. Are there any that expose her to
contempt, or threaten her destruction? Let us alone to deal with them.
Let Paul say ever so much to prove that those are no gods which are made
with hands, we will abide by it that, whatever becomes of other gods and
goddesses, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. We must and will stand up
for the religion of our country, which we have received by tradition
from our fathers." Thus all people walked every one in the name of his
god, and all thought well of their own; much more should the servants of
the true God do so, who can say, This God is our God for ever and ever.
(3.) A great disorder among themselves ([Act
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029).md): The whole city was full of
confusion - he common and natural effect of intemperate zeal for a false
religion; it throws all into confusion, dethrones reason, and enthrones
passion; and men run together, not only not knowing one another's minds,
but not knowing their own.

3\. The proceedings of the mob under the power of these resentments, and
how far they were carried.

(1.) They laid hands on some of Paul's companions, and hurried them into
the theatre ([Act 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029).md), some think
with design there to make them fight with beasts, as Paul had sometimes
done; or perhaps they intended only to abuse them, and to make them a
spectacle to the crowd. Those whom they seized were Gaius and
Aristarchus, of both of whom we read elsewhere. Gaius was of Derbe, [Act
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md). Aristarchus is also there spoken
of, and [Col 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md). They came with Paul
from Macedonia, and this was their only crime, that they were Paul's
companions in travel, both in services and sufferings.

(2.) Paul, who had escaped being seized by them, when he perceived his
friends in distress for his sake, would have entered in unto the people,
to sacrifice himself, if there were no other remedy, rather than his
friends should suffer upon his account; and it was an evidence of a
generous spirit, and that he loved his neighbour as himself.

(3.) He was persuaded from it by the kindness of his friends, who
overruled him. \[1.\] The disciples suffered him not, for it better
became him to offer it than it would have become them to suffer it. They
had reason to say to Paul, as David's servants did to him, when he was
for exposing himself in a piece of public service, Thou art worth ten
thousand of us, [Sa2 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#003.md). \[2.\]
Others of his friends interposed, to prevent his throwing himself thus
into the mouth of danger. They would treat him much worse than Gaius and
Aristarchus, looking upon him as the ringleader of the party; and
therefore better let them bear the brunt of the storm than that he
should venture into it, [Act 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#031.md).
They were certain of the chief of Asia, the princes of Asia - Asiarchai.
The critics tell us they were the chief of their priests; or, as others,
the chief of their players. Whether they were converts to the Christian
faith (and some such there were even of their priests and governors), or
whether they were only well-wishers to Paul, as an ingenuous good man,
we are not told, only that they were Paul's friends. Dr. Lightfoot
suggests that they kept up a respect and kindness for him ever since he
fought with beasts in their theatre, and were afraid he should be abused
so again. Note, It is a friendly part to take more care of the lives and
comforts of good men than they do themselves. It would be a very
hazardous adventure for Paul to go into the theatre; it was a thousand
to one that it would cost him his life; and therefore Paul was overruled
by his friends to obey the law of self-preservation, and has taught us
to keep out of the way of danger as long as we can without going out of
the way of duty. We may be called to lay down our lives, but not to
throw away our lives. It would better become Paul to venture into a
synagogue than into a theatre.

(4.) The mob was in a perfect confusion ([Act
19:32](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#032).md): Some cried one thing and some
another, according as their fancies and passions, and perhaps the
reports they received, led them. Some cried, Down with the Jews; others,
Down with Paul; but the assembly was confused, as not understanding one
another's minds. They contradicted one another, and were ready to fly in
one another's faces for it, but they did not understand their own; for
the truth was the greater part knew not wherefore they had come
together. They knew not what began the riot, nor who, much less what
business they had there; but, upon such occasions, the greatest part
come only to enquire what the matter is: they follow the cry, follow the
crowd, increase like a snow-ball, and where there are many there will be
more.

(5.) The Jews would have interested themselves in this tumult (in other
places they had been the first movers of such riots) but now at Ephesus
they had not interest enough to raise the mob, and yet, when it was
raised, they had ill-will enough to set in with it ([Act
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#035).md): They drew Alexander out of the
multitude, called him out to speak on the behalf of the Jews against
Paul and his companions: "You have heard what Demetrius and the
silversmiths have to say against them, as enemies to their religion;
give us leave now to tell you what we have to say against him as an
enemy to our religion." The Jews put him forward to do this, encouraged
him, and told him they would stand by him and second him; and this they
looked upon as necessary in their own defence, and therefore what he
designed to say is called his apologizing to the people, not for himself
in particular, but for the Jews in general, whom the worshippers of
Diana looked upon to be as much their enemies as Paul was. Now they
would have them know that they were as much Paul's enemies as they were;
and those who are thus careful to distinguish themselves from the
servants of Christ now, and are afraid of being taken for them, shall
have their doom accordingly in the great day. Alexander beckoned with
the hand, desiring to be heard against Paul; for it had been strange if
a persecution had been carried on against the Christians and there were
not Jews at one end or the other of it: if they could not begin the
mischief, they would help it forward, and so make themselves partakers
of other men's sins. Some think this Alexander had been a Christian, but
had apostatized to Judaism, and therefore was drawn out as a proper
person to accuse Paul; and that he was the Alexander the coppersmith
that did Paul so much evil ([Ti2
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#014).md), and whom he had delivered unto
Satan, [Ti1 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020.md).

(6.) This occasioned the prosecutors to drop the prosecution of Paul's
friends, and to turn it into acclamations in honour of their goddess
([Act 19:34](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#034).md): When they knew that he
was a Jew, and, as such, an enemy to the worship of Diana (for the Jews
had now an implacable hatred to idols and idolatry), whatever he had to
say for Paul or against him, they were resolved not to hear him, and
therefore set the mob a shouting, "Great is Diana of the Ephesians;
whoever runs her down, be he Jew or Christian, we are resolved to cry
her up. She is Diana of the Ephesians, our Diana; and it is our honour
and happiness to have her temple with us; and she is great, a famous
goddess, and universally adored. There are other Dianas, but Diana of
the Ephesians is beyond them all, because her temple is more rich and
magnificent than any of theirs." This was all the cry for two hours
together; and it was thought a sufficient confutation of Paul's
doctrine, that those are not gods which are made with hands. Thus the
most sacred truths are often run down with nothing else but noise and
clamour and popular fury. It was said of old concerning idolaters that
they were mad upon their idols; and here is an instance of it. Diana
made the Ephesians great, for the town was enriched by the vast
concourse of people from all parts to Diana's temple there, and
therefore they are concerned by all means possible to keep up her
sinking reputation with, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.

4\. The suppressing and dispersing of these rioters, by the prudence and
vigilance of the town-clerk; he is called, grammateus - the scribe, or
secretary, or recorder; "the register of their games," the Olympic games
(so others), whose business it was to preserve the names of the victors
and the prizes they won. With much ado he, at length, stilled the noise,
so as to be heard, and then made a pacific speech to them, and gave us
an instance of that of Solomon, The words of wise men are heard in quiet
more than the cry of him that rules among fools, as Demetrius did. [Ecc
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#017.md).

(1.) He humours them with an acknowledgment that Diana was the
celebrated goddess of the Ephesians, [Act
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#035.md). They needed not to be so loud
and strenuous in asserting a truth which nobody denied, or could be
ignorant of: Every one knows that the city of the Ephesians is a
worshipper of the great goddess Diana; is neōkoros; not only that the
inhabitants were worshippers of this goddess, but the city, as a
corporation, was, by its charter, entrusted with the worship of Diana,
to take care of her temple, and to accommodate those who came thither to
do her homage. Ephesus is the aeditua (they say that is the most proper
word), or the sacrist, of the great goddess Diana. The city was more the
patroness and protectress of Diana than Diana was of the city. Such
great care did idolaters take for the keeping up of the worship of gods
made with hands, while the worship of the true and living God is
neglected, and few nations or cities glory in patronizing and protecting
that. The temple of Diana at Ephesus was a very rich and sumptuous
structure, but, it should seem, the image of Diana in the temple,
because they thought it sanctified the temple, was had in greater
veneration than the temple, for they persuaded the people that it fell
down from Jupiter, and therefore was none of the gods that were made
with men's hands. See how easily the credulity of superstitious people
is imposed upon by the fraud of designing men. Because this image of
Diana had been set up time out of mind, and nobody could tell who made
it, they made the people believe it fell down from Jupiter. "Now these
things," says the town-clerk very gravely (but whether seriously or no,
and as one that did himself believe them, may be questioned), "cannot be
spoken against; they have obtained such universal credit that you need
not fear contradiction, it can do you no prejudice." Some take it thus:
"Seeing the image of Diana fell down from Jupiter, as we all believe,
then what is said against gods made with hands does not at all affect
us."

(2.) He cautions them against all violent and tumultuous proceedings,
which their religion did not need, nor could receive any real advantage
from ([Act 19:36](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#036).md): You ought to be
quiet, and to do nothing rashly. A very good rule this is to be observed
at all times, both in private and public affairs; not to be hasty and
precipitate in our motions, but to deliberate and take time to consider:
not to put ourselves or others into a heat, but to be calm and composed,
and always keep reason in the throne and passion under check. This word
should be ready to us, to command the peace with, when we ourselves or
those about us are growing disorderly: We ought to be quiet, and to do
nothing rashly; to do nothing in haste, which we may repent of at
leisure.

(3.) He wipes off the odium that had been cast upon Paul and his
associates, and tells them, they were not the men that they were
represented to them to be ([Act
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#037).md): "You have brought hither these
men, and are ready to pull them to pieces; but have you considered what
is their transgression and what is their offence? What can you prove
upon them? They are not robbers of churches, you cannot charge them with
sacrilege, or the taking away of any dedicated thing. They have offered
no violence to Diana's temple or the treasures of it; nor are they
blasphemers of your goddess; they have not given any opprobrious
language to the worshippers of Diana, nor spoken scurrilously of her or
her temple. Why should you prosecute those with all this violence who,
though they are not of your mind, yet do not inveigh with any bitterness
against you? Since they are calm, why should you be hot?" It was the
idol in the heart that they levelled all their force against, by reason
and argument; if they can but get that down, the idol in the temple will
fall of course. Those that preach against idolatrous churches have truth
on their side, and ought vigorously to maintain it and press it on men's
consciences; but let them not be robbers of those churches (on the prey
laid they not their hand, [Est 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#015.md),
[Est 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#016).md), nor blasphemers of those
worships; with meekness instructing, not with passion and foul language
reproaching, those that oppose themselves; for God's truth, as it needs
not man's lie, so it needs not man's intemperate heat. The wrath of man
worketh not the righteousness of God.

(4.) He turns them over to the regular methods of the law, which ought
always to supersede popular tumults, and in civilized well-governed
nations will do so. A great mercy it is to live in a country where
provision is made for the keeping of the peace, and the administration
of public justice, and the appointing of a remedy for every wrong; and
herein we of this nation are as happy as any people. \[1.\] If the
complaint be of a private injury, let them have recourse to the judges
and courts of justice, which are kept publicly at stated times. If
Demetrius and the company of the silversmiths, that have made all this
rout, find themselves aggrieved, or any privilege they are legally
entitled to infringed or entrenched upon, let them bring their action,
take out a process, and the matter shall be fairly tried, and justice
done: The law is open, and there are deputies; there is a proconsul and
his delegate, whose business it is to hear both sides, and to determine
according to equity; and in their determination all parties must
acquiesce, and not be their own judges, nor appeal to the people. Note,
The law is good if a man use it lawfully, as the last remedy both for
the discovery of a right disputed and the recovery of a right denied.
\[2.\] If the complaint be of a public grievance, relating to the
constitution, it must be redressed, not by a confused rabble, but by a
convention of the states ([Act 19:39](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#039).md):
If you enquire any thing concerning other matters, that are of common
concern, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly of the aldermen and
common-council, called together in a regular way by those in authority.
Note, Private persons should not intermeddle in public matters, so as to
anticipate the counsels of those whose business it is to take cognizance
of them; we have enough to do to mind our own business.

(5.) He makes them sensible of the danger they are in, and of the
premunire they have run themselves into by this riot ([Act
19:40](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#040).md): "It is well if we be not
called in question for this day's uproar, if we be not complained of at
the emperor's court, as a factious and seditious city, and if a quo
warranto be not brought against us and our charter taken away; for there
is no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse, we have
nothing to say in excuse of it. We cannot justify ourselves in breaking
the peace by saying that others broke it first, and we only acted
defensively; we have no colour for any such plea, and therefore let the
matter go no further, for it has gone too far already." Note, Most
people stand in awe of men's judgment more than of the judgment of God.
How well were it if we would thus still the tumult of our disorderly
appetites and passions, and check the violence of them, with the
consideration of the account we must shortly give to the Judge of heaven
and earth for all these disorders! We are in danger to be called in
question for this day's uproar in our hearts, in our houses; and how
shall we answer it, there being no cause, no just cause, or no
proportionable one, whereby we may give an account of this concourse,
and of this heat and violence? As we must repress the inordinacy of our
appetites, so also of our passions, with this, that for all these things
God will bring us unto judgment ([Ecc
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009).md), and we are concerned to manage
ourselves as those that must give account.

(6.) When he has thus shown them the absurdity of their riotous meeting,
and the bad consequences that might follow from it, he advises them to
separate with all speed ([Act 19:41](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#041).md):
he dismissed the assembly, ordered the crier perhaps to give notice that
all manner of persons should peaceably depart and go about their own
business, and they did so. See here, \[1.\] How the overruling
providence of God preserves the public peace, by an unaccountable power
over the spirits of men. Thus the world is kept in some order, and men
are restrained from being as the fishes of the sea, where the greater
devour the less. Considering what an impetuous furious thing, what an
ungovernable untameable wild beast the mob is, when it is up, we shall
see reason to acknowledge God's goodness that we are not always under
the tyranny of it. He stills the noise of the sea, noise of her waves,
and (which is no less an instance of his almighty power) the tumult of
the people, [Psa 65:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#007.md). \[2.\] See how
many ways God has of protecting his people. Perhaps this town-clerk was
no friend at all to Paul, nor to the gospel he preached, yet his human
prudence is made to serve the divine purpose. Many are the troubles of
the righteous, but the Lord delivereth them out of them all.
