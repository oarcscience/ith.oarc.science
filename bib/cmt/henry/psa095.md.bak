### [Psalms Chapter 95](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 95:0</span></span>

For the expounding of this psalm we may borrow a great deal of light
from the apostle's discourse, Heb. 3 and 4, where it appears both to
have been penned by David and to have been calculated for the days of
the Messiah; for it is there said expressly ([Heb
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#007).md) that the day here spoken of ([Psa
95:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007).md) is to be understood of the
gospel day, in which God speaks to us by his Son in a voice which we are
concerned to hear, and proposes to us a rest besides that of Canaan. In
singing psalms it is intended, I. That we should "make melody unto the
Lord;" this we are here excited to do, and assisted in doing, being
called upon to praise God ([Psa 95:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001.md),
[Psa 95:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#002).md) as a great God ([Psa
95:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#003).md) and as our gracious benefactor
([Psa 95:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#006.md), [Psa
95:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007).md). II. That we should teach and
admonish ourselves and one another; and we are here taught and warned to
hear God's voice ([Psa 95:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007).md), and not
to harden our hearts, as the Israelites in the wilderness did ([Psa
95:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#008.md), [Psa
95:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#009).md), lest we fall under God's wrath
and fall short of his rest, as they did ([Psa
95:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#010.md), [Psa
95:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#011).md). This psalm must be sung with a
holy reverence of God's majesty and a dread of his justice, with a
desire to please him and a fear to offend him.

[Psalms 95:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 95:1</span></span>

The psalmist here, as often elsewhere, stirs up himself and others to
praise God; for it is a duty which ought to be performed with the most
lively affections, and which we have great need to be excited to, being
very often backward to it and cold in it. Observe,

I. How God is to be praised. 1. With holy joy and delight in him. The
praising song must be a joyful noise, [Psa
95:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001.md) and again [Psa
95:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#002.md). Spiritual joy is the heart and
soul of thankful praise. It is the will of God (such is the
condescension of his grace) that when we give glory to him as a being
infinitely perfect and blessed we should, at the same time, rejoice in
him as our Father and King, and a God in covenant with us. 2. With
humble reverence, and a holy awe of him ([Psa
95:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#006).md): "Let us worship, and bow down,
and kneel before him, as becomes those who know what an infinite
distance there is between us and God, how much we are in danger of his
wrath and in need of his mercy." Though bodily exercise, alone, profits
little, yet certainly it is our duty to glorify God with our bodies by
the outward expressions of reverence, seriousness, and humility, in the
duties of religious worship. 3. We must praise God with our voice; we
must speak forth, sing forth, his praises out of the abundance of a
heart filled with love, and joy, and thankfulness - Sing to the Lord;
make a noise, a joyful noise to him, with psalms - as those who are
ourselves much affected with his greatness and goodness, are forward to
own ourselves so, are desirous to be more and more affected therewith,
and would willingly be instrumental to kindle and inflame the same pious
and devout affection in others also. 4. We must praise God in concert,
in the solemn assemblies: "Come, let us sing; let us join in singing to
the Lord; not others without me, nor I alone, but others with me. Let us
come together before his presence, in the courts of his house, where his
people are wont to attend him and to expect his manifestations of
himself." Whenever we come into God's presence we must come with
thanksgiving that we are admitted to such a favour; and, whenever we
have thanks to give, we must come before God's presence, set ourselves
before him, and present ourselves to him in the ordinances which he has
appointed.

II\. Why God is to be praised and what must be the matter of our praise.
We do not want matter; it were well if we did not want a heart. We must
praise God,

1\. Because he is a great God, and sovereign Lord of all, [Psa
95:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#003.md). He is great, and therefore
greatly to be praised. He is infinite and immense, and has all
perfection in himself. (1.) He has great power: He is a great King above
all gods, above all deputed deities, all magistrates, to whom he said,
You are gods (he manages them all, and serves his own purposes by them,
and to him they are all accountable), above all counterfeit deities, all
pretenders, all usurpers; he can do that which none of them can do; he
can, and will, famish and vanquish them all. (2.) He has great
possessions. This lower world is here particularly specified. We reckon
those great men who have large territories, which they call their own
against all the world, which yet are a very inconsiderable part of the
universe: how great then is that God whose the whole earth is, and the
fulness thereof, not only under whose feet it is, as he has an
incontestable dominion over all the creatures and a propriety in them,
but in whose hand it is, as he has the actual directing and disposing of
all ([Psa 95:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#004).md); even the deep places
of the earth, which are out of our sight, subterraneous springs and
mines, are in his hand; and the height of the hills which are out of our
reach, whatever grows or feeds upon them, is his also. This may be taken
figuratively: the meanest of the children of men, who are as the low
places of the earth, are not beneath his cognizance; and the greatest,
who are as the strength of the hills, are not above his control.
Whatever strength is in any creature it is derived from God and employed
for him ([Psa 95:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#005).md): The sea is his,
and all that is in it (the waves fulfil his word); it is his, for he
made it, gathered its waters and fixed its shores; the dry land, though
given to the children of men, is his too, for he still reserved the
property to himself; it is his, for his hands formed it, when his word
made the dry land appear. His being the Creator of all makes him,
without dispute, the owner of all. This being a gospel psalm, we may
very well suppose that it is the Lord Jesus whom we are here taught to
praise. He is a great God; the mighty God is one of his titles, and God
over all, blessed for evermore. As Mediator, he is a great King above
all gods; by him kings reign; and angels, principalities, and powers,
are subject to him; by him, as the eternal Word, all things were made
([Joh 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003).md), and it was fit he should
be the restorer and reconciler of all who was the Creator of all, [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md), [Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020.md). To him all power is given both
in heaven and in earth, and into his hand all things are delivered. It
is he that sets one foot on the sea and the other on the earth, as
sovereign Lord of both ([Rev 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#002).md),
and therefore to him we must sing our songs of praise, and before him we
must worship and bow down.

2\. Because he is our God, not only has a dominion over us, as he has
over all the creatures, but stands in special relation to us ([Psa
95:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007).md): He is our God, and therefore it
is expected we should praise him; who will, if we do not? What else did
he make us for but that we should be to him for a name and a praise?
(1.) He is our Creator, and the author of our being; we must kneel
before the Lord our Maker, [Psa 95:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#006.md).
Idolaters kneel before gods which they themselves made; we kneel before
a God who made us and all the world and who is therefore our rightful
proprietor; for his we are, and not our own. (2.) He is our Saviour, and
the author of our blessedness. He is here called the rock of our
salvation ([Psa 95:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001).md), not only the
founder, but the very foundation, of that work of wonder, on whom it is
built. That rock is Christ; to him therefore we must sing our songs of
praises, to him that sits upon the throne and to the Lamb. (3.) We are
therefore his, under all possible obligations: We are the people of his
pasture and the sheep of his hand. All the children of men are so; they
are fed and led by his Providence, which cares for them, and conducts
them, as the shepherd the sheep. We must praise him, not only because he
made us, but because he preserves and maintains us, and our breath and
ways are in his hand. All the church's children are in a special manner
so; Israel are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand; and
therefore he demands their homage in a special manner. The gospel church
is his flock. Christ is the great and good Shepherd of it. We, as
Christians, are led by his hand into the green pastures, by him we are
protected and well provided for, to his honour and service we are
entirely devoted as a peculiar people, and therefore to him must be
glory in the churches (whether it be in the world or no) throughout all
ages, [Eph 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#021.md).

[Psalms 95:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 95:7</span></span>

The latter part of this psalm, which begins in the middle of a verse, is
an exhortation to those who sing gospel psalms to live gospel lives, and
to hear the voice of God's word; otherwise, how can they expect that he
should hear the voice of their prayers and praises? Observe,

I. The duty required of all those that are the people of Christ's
pasture and the sheep of his hand. He expects that they hear his voice,
for he has said, My sheep hear my voice, [Joh
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#027.md). We are his people, say they.
Are you so? Then hear his voice. If you call him Master, or Lord, then
do the things which he says, and be his willing obedient people. Hear
the voice of his doctrine, of his law, and, in both, of his Spirit; hear
and heed; hear and yield. Hear his voice, and not the voice of a
stranger. If you will hear his voice; some take it as a wish, O that you
would hear his voice! that you would be so wise, and do so well for
yourselves; like that, If thou hadst known ([Luk
19:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#042).md), that is, O that thou hadst
known! Christ's voice must be heard today; this the apostle lays much
stress upon, applying it to the gospel day. While he is speaking to you
see that you attend to him, for this day of your opportunities will not
last always; improve it, therefore, while it is called today, [Heb
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#013.md), [Heb
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#015.md). Hearing the voice of Christ is
the same with believing. Today, if by faith you accept the gospel offer,
well and good, but tomorrow it may be too late. In a matter of such vast
importance nothing is more dangerous than delay.

II\. The sin they are warned against, as inconsistent with the believing
obedient ear required, and that is hardness of heart. If you will hear
his voice, and profit by what you hear, then do not harden your hearts;
for the seed sown on the rock never brought any fruit to perfection. The
Jews therefore believed not the gospel of Christ because their hearts
were hardened; they were not convinced of the evil of sin, and of their
danger by reason of sin, and therefore they regarded not the offer of
salvation; they would not bend to the yoke of Christ, nor yield to his
demands; and, if the sinner's heart be hardened, it is his own act and
deed (he hardening it himself) and he alone shall bear the blame for
ever.

III\. The example they are warned by, which is that of the Israelites in
the wilderness.

1\. "Take heed of sinning as they did, lest you be shut out of the
everlasting rest as they were out of Canaan." Be not, as your fathers, a
stubborn and rebellious generation, [Psa
78:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#008.md). Thus here, Harden not your heart
as you did (that is, your ancestors) in the provocation, or in Meribah,
the place where they quarrelled with God and Moses ([Exo
17:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#002).md), and in the day of temptation
in the wilderness, [Psa 95:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#008.md). So often
did they provoke God by their distrusts and murmurings that the whole
time of their continuance in the wilderness might be called a day of
temptation, or Massah, the other name given to that place ([Exo
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#007).md), because they tempted the Lord,
saying, Is the Lord among us or is he not? This was in the wilderness,
where they could not help themselves, but lay at God's mercy, and where
God wonderfully helped them and gave them such sensible proofs of his
power and tokens of his favour as never any people had before or since.
Note, (1.) Days of temptation are days of provocation. Nothing is more
offensive to God than disbelief of his promise and despair of the
performance of it because of some difficulties that seem to lie in the
way. (2.) The more experience we have had of the power and goodness of
God the greater is our sin if we distrust him. What, to tempt him in the
wilderness, where we live upon him! This is as ungrateful as it is
absurd and unreasonable. (3.) Hardness of heart is at the bottom of all
our distrusts of God and quarrels with him. That is a hard heart which
receives not the impressions of divine discoveries and conforms not to
the intentions of the divine will, which will not melt, which will not
bend. (4.) The sins of others ought to be warnings to us not to tread in
their steps. The murmurings of Israel were written for our admonition,
[Co1 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011.md).

2\. Now here observe,

(1.) The charge drawn up, in God's name, against the unbelieving
Israelites, [Psa 95:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#009.md), [Psa
95:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#010.md). God here, many ages after,
complains of their ill conduct towards him, with the expressions of high
resentment. \[1.\] Their sin was unbelief: they tempted God and proved
him; they questioned whether they might take his word, and insisted upon
further security before they would go forward to Canaan, by sending
spies; and, when those discouraged them, they protested against the
sufficiency of the divine power and promise, and would make a captain
and return into Egypt, [Num 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#003.md), [Num
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#004.md). This is called rebellion, [Deu
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#026.md), [Deu
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#032.md). \[2.\] The aggravation of this
sin was that they saw God's work; they saw what he had done for them in
bringing them out of Egypt, nay, what he was now doing for them every
day, this day, in the bread he rained from heaven for them and the water
out of the rock that followed them, than which they could not have more
unquestionable evidences of God's presence with them. With them even
seeing was not believing, because they hardened their hearts, though
they had seen what Pharaoh got by hardening his heart. \[3.\] The causes
of their sin. See what God imputed it to: It is a people that do err in
their hearts, and they have not known my ways. Men's unbelief and
distrust of God, their murmurings and quarrels with him, are the effect
of their ignorance and mistake. First, Of their ignorance: They have not
known my ways. They saw his work ([Psa
95:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#009).md) and he made known his acts to
them ([Psa 103:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#007).md); and yet they did
not know his ways, the ways of his providence, in which he walked
towards them, or the ways of his commandments, in which he would have
them to walk towards him: they did not know, they did not rightly
understand and therefore did not approve of these. Note, The reason why
people slight and forsake the ways of God is because they do not know
them. Secondly, Of their mistake: They do err in their heart; they
wander out of the way; in heart they turn back. Note, Sins are errors,
practical errors, errors in heart; such there are, and as fatal as
errors in the head. When the corrupt affections pervert the judgment,
and so lead the soul out of the ways of duty and obedience, there is an
error of the heart. \[4.\] God's resentment of their sin: Forty years
long was I grieved with this generation. Not, The sins of God's
professing people do not only anger him, but grieve him, especially
their distrust of him; and God keeps an account how often ([Num
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#022).md) and how long they grieve him.
See the patience of God towards provoking sinners; he was grieved with
them forty years, and yet those years ended in a triumphant entrance
into Canaan made by the next generation. If our sins have grieved God,
surely they should grieve us, and nothing in sin should grieve us so
much as that.

(2.) The sentence passed upon them for their sin ([Psa
95:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#011).md): "Unto whom I swore in my
wrath, If they shall enter into my rest, then say I am changeable and
untrue:" see the sentence at large, [Num
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#021.md), etc. Observe, \[1.\] Whence
this sentence came - from the wrath of God. He swore solemnly in his
wrath, his just and holy wrath; but let not men therefore swear
profanely in their wrath, their sinful brutish wrath. God is not subject
to such passions as we are; but he is said to be angry, very angry, at
sin and sinners, to show the malignity of sin and the justice of God's
government. That is certainly an evil thing which deserves such a
recompence of revenge as may be expected from a provoked Deity. \[2.\]
What it was: That they should not enter into his rest, the rest which he
had prepared and designed for them, a settlement for them and theirs,
that none of those who were enrolled when they came out of Egypt should
be found written in the roll of the living at their entering into
Canaan, but Caleb and Joshua. \[3.\] How it was ratified: I swore it. It
was not only a purpose, but a decree; the oath showed the immutability
of his counsel; the Lord swore, and will not repent. It cut off the
thought of any reserve of mercy. God's threatenings are as sure as his
promises.

Now this case of Israel may be applied to those of their posterity that
lived in David's time, when this psalm was penned; let them hear God's
voice, and not harden their hearts as their fathers did, lest, if they
were stiffnecked like them, God should be provoked to forbid them the
privileges of his temple at Jerusalem, of which he had said, This is my
rest. But it must be applied to us Christians, because so the apostle
applies it. There is a spiritual and eternal rest set before us, and
promised to us, of which Canaan was a type; we are all (in profession,
at least) bound for this rest; yet many that seem to be so come short
and shall never enter into it. And what is it that puts a bar in their
door? It is sin; it is unbelief, that sin against the remedy, against
our appeal. Those that, like Israel, distrust God, and his power and
goodness, and prefer the garlick and onions of Egypt before the milk and
honey of Canaan, will justly be shut out from his rest: so shall their
doom be; they themselves have decided it. Let us therefore fear, [Heb
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#001.md).
