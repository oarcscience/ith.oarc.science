### [Genesis Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 42:0</span></span>

We had, in the foregoing chapter, the fulfilling of the dreams which
Joseph had interpreted: in this and the following chapters we have the
fulfilling of the dreams which Joseph himself had dreamed, that his
father's family should do homage to him. The story is very largely and
particularly related of what passed between Joseph and his brethren, not
only because it is an entertaining story, and probably was much talked
of, both among the Israelites and among the Egyptians, but because it is
very instructive, and it gave occasion for the removal of Jacob's family
into Egypt, on which so many great events afterwards depended. We have,
in this chapter, I. The humble application of Jacob's sons to Joseph to
buy corn ([Gen 42:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#001).md). II. The fright
Joseph put them into, for their trial ([Gen
42:7-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#007).md). III. The conviction they
were now under of their sin concerning Joseph long before ([Gen
42:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#021).md). IV. Their return to Canaan
with corn, and the great distress their good father was in upon hearing
the account of their expedition ([Gen
42:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#025), etc..md).

[Genesis 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 42:1</span></span>

Though Jacob's sons were all married, and had families of their own,
yet, it should seem, they were still incorporated in one society, under
the conduct and presidency of their father Jacob. We have here,

I. The orders he gave them to go and buy corn in Egypt, [Gen
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#001.md), [Gen
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#002.md). Observe, 1. The famine was
grievous in the land of Canaan. It is observable that all the three
patriarches, to whom Canaan was the land of promise, met with famine in
that land, which was not only to try their faith, whether they could
trust God though he should slay them, though he should starve them, but
to teach them to seek the better country, that is, the heavenly, [Heb
11:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#014.md). We have need of something to
wean us from this world, and make us long for a better. 2. Still, when
there was famine in Canaan, there was corn in Egypt. Thus Providence
orders it, that one place should be a succour and supply to another; for
we are all brethren. The Egyptians, the seed of accursed Ham, have
plenty, when God's blessed Israel want: Thus God, in dispensing common
favours, often crosses hands. Yet observe, The plenty Egypt now had was
owing, under God, to Joseph's prudence and care: if his brethren had not
sold him into Egypt, but respected him according to his merits, who
knows but he might have done the same thing for Jacob's family which now
he had done for Pharaoh, and the Egyptians might then have come to them
to buy corn? but those who drive away from among them wise and good men
know not what they do. 3. Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt; he saw
the corn that his neighbours had bought there and brought home. It is a
spur to exertion to see where supplies are to be had, and to see others
supplied. Shall others get food for their souls, and shall we starve
while it is to be had? 4. He reproved his sons for delaying to provide
corn for their families. Why do you look one upon another? Note, When we
are in trouble and want, it is folly for us to stand looking upon one
another, that is, to stand desponding and despairing, as if there were
no hope, no help, - to stand disputing either which shall have the
honour of going first or which shall have the safety of coming last, -
to stand deliberating and debating what we shall do, and doing nothing,
- to stand dreaming under a spirit of slumber, as if we had nothing to
do, and to stand delaying, as if we had time at command. Let it never be
said, "We left that to be done tomorrow which we could a well have done
today." 5. He quickened them to go to Egypt: Get you down thither.
Masters of families must not only pray for daily bread for their
families, and food convenient, but must lay out themselves with care and
industry to provide it.

II\. Their obedience to these orders, [Gen
42:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#003.md). They went down to buy corn; they
did not send their servants, but very prudently went themselves, to lay
out their own money. Let none think themselves too great nor too good to
take pains. Masters of families should see with their own eyes, and take
heed of leaving too much to servants. Only Benjamin went not with them,
for he was his father's darling. To Egypt they came, among others, and,
having a considerable cargo of corn to buy, they were brought before
Joseph himself, who probably expected they would come; and, according to
the laws of courtesy, they bowed down themselves before him, [Gen
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#006.md). Now their empty sheaves did
obeisance to his full one. Compare this with [Isa
60:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#014.md) and [Rev
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#009.md).

[Genesis 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 42:7</span></span>

We may well wonder that Joseph, during the twenty years that he had now
been in Egypt, especially during the last seven years that he had been
in power there, never sent to his father to acquaint him with his
circumstances; nay, it is strange that he who so often went throughout
all the land of Egypt ([Gen 41:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#045.md),
[Gen 41:46](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#046).md) never made an excursion to
Canaan, to visit his aged father, when he was in the borders of Egypt,
that lay next to Canaan. Perhaps it would not have been above three or
four days' journey for him in his chariot. It is a probable conjecture
that his whole management of himself in this affair was by special
direction from Heaven, that the purpose of God concerning Jacob and his
family might be accomplished. When Joseph's brethren came, he knew them
by many a satisfactory token, but they knew not him, little thinking to
find him there, [Gen 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#008.md). He
remembered the dreams ([Gen 42:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#009).md), but
they had forgotten them. The laying up of God's oracles in our hearts
will be of excellent use to us in all our conduct. Joseph had an eye to
his dreams, which he knew to be divine, in his carriage towards his
brethren, and aimed at the accomplishment of them and the bringing of
his brethren to repentance for their former sins; and both these points
were gained.

I. He showed himself very rigorous and harsh with them. The very manner
of his speaking, considering the post he was in, was enough to frighten
them; for he spoke roughly to them, [Gen
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#007.md). He charged them with bad designs
against the government ([Gen 42:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#009).md),
treated them as dangerous persons, saying, You are spies, and protesting
by the life of Pharaoh that they were so, [Gen
42:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#016.md). Some make this an oath, others
make it no more than a vehement asseveration, like that, as thy soul
liveth; however it was more than yea, yea, and nay, nay, and therefore
came of evil. Note, Bad words are soon learned by converse with those
that use them, but not so soon unlearned. Joseph, by being much at
court, got the courtier's oath, By the life of Pharaoh, perhaps
designing hereby to confirm his brethren in their belief that he was an
Egyptian, and not an Israelite. They knew this was not the language of a
son of Abraham. When Peter would prove himself no disciple of Christ, he
cursed and swore. Now why was Joseph thus hard upon his brethren? We may
be sure it was not from a spirit of revenge, that he might now trample
upon those who had formerly trampled upon him; he was not a man of that
temper. But, 1. It was to enrich his own dreams, and complete the
accomplishment of them. 2. It was to bring them to repentance. 3. It was
to get out of them an account of the state of their family, which he
longed to know: they would have discovered him if he had asked as a
friend, therefore he asks as a judge. Not seeing his brother Benjamin
with them, perhaps he began to suspect that they had made away with him
too, and therefore gives them occasion to speak of their father and
brother. Note, God in his providence sometimes seems harsh with those he
loves, and speaks roughly to those for whom yet he has great mercy in
store.

II\. They, hereupon, were very submissive. They spoke to him with all
the respect imaginable: Nay, my lord ([Gen
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#010).md) - a great change since they
said, Behold, this dreamer comes. They very modestly deny the charge: We
are no spies. They tell him their business, that they came to buy food,
a justifiable errand, and the same that many strangers came to Egypt
upon at this time. They undertake to give a particular account of
themselves and their family ([Gen
42:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#013).md), and this was what they wanted.

III\. He clapped them all up in prison for three days, [Gen
42:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#017.md). Thus God deals with the souls
he designs for special comfort and honour; he first humbles them, and
terrifies them, and brings them under a spirit of bondage, and then
binds up their wounds by the Spirit of adoption.

IV\. He concluded with them, at last, that one of them should be left as
a hostage, and the rest should go home and fetch Benjamin. It was a very
encouraging word he said to them ([Gen
42:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#018).md): I fear God; as if he had said,
"You may assure yourselves I will do you no wrong; I dare not, for I
know that, high as I am, there is one higher than I." Note, With those
that fear God we have reason to expect fair dealing. The fear of God
will be a check upon those that are in power, to restrain them from
abusing their power to oppression and tyranny. Those that have no one
else to stand in awe of ought to stand in awe of their own consciences.
See [Neh 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#015.md), So did not I, because
of the fear of God.

[Genesis 42:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 42:21</span></span>

Here is, I. The penitent reflection Joseph's brethren made upon the
wrong they had formerly done to him, [Gen
42:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#021.md). They talked the matter over in
the Hebrew tongue, not suspecting that Joseph, whom they took for a
native of Egypt, understood them, much less that he was the person they
spoke of.

1\. They remembered with regret the barbarous cruelty wherewith they
persecuted him: We are verily guilty concerning our brother. We do not
read that they said this during their three days' imprisonment; but now,
when the matter had come to some issue and they saw themselves still
embarrassed, now they began to relent. Perhaps Joseph's mention of the
fear of God ([Gen 42:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#018).md) put them upon
consideration and extorted this reflection. Now see here, (1.) The
office of conscience; it is a remembrancer, to bring to mind things long
since said and done, to show us wherein we have erred, though it was
long ago, as the reflection here mentioned was above twenty years after
the sin was committed. As time will not wear out the guilt of sin, so it
will not blot out the records of conscience; when the guilt of this sin
of Joseph's brethren was fresh they made light of it, and sat down to
eat bread; but now, long afterwards, their consciences reminded them of
it. (2.) The benefit of affliction; they often prove the happy and
effectual means of awakening conscience, and bringing sin to our
remembrance, [Job 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#026). (3..md) The evil
of guilt concerning our brethren; of all their sins, it was this that
conscience now reproached them for. Whenever we think we have wrong done
us, we ought to remember the wrong we have done to others, [Ecc
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#021.md), [Ecc
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#022.md).

2\. Reuben alone remembered, with comfort, that he had been an advocate
for his brother, and had done what he could to prevent the mischief they
did him ([Gen 42:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#022).md): Spoke I not unto
you, saying, Do not sin against the child? Note, (1.) It is an
aggravation of any sin that it was committed against admonitions. (2.)
When we come to share with others in their calamities, it will be a
comfort to us if we have the testimony of our consciences for us that we
did not share with them in their iniquities, but, in our places,
witnessed against them. This shall be our rejoicing in the day of evil,
and shall take out the sting.

II\. Joseph's tenderness towards them upon this occasion. He retired
from them to weep, [Gen 42:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#024.md). Though
his reason directed that he should still carry himself as a stranger to
them, because they were not as yet humbled enough, yet natural affection
could not but work, for he was a man of a tender spirit. This represents
the tender mercies of our God towards repenting sinners. See [Jer
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#020.md), Since I spoke against him I do
earnestly remember him still. See [Jdg
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#016.md).

III\. The imprisonment of Simeon, [Gen
42:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#024.md). He chose him for the hostage
probably because he remembered him to have been his most bitter enemy,
or because he observed him now to be least humbled and concerned; he
bound him before their eyes to affect them all; or perhaps it is
intimated that, though he bound him with some severity before them, yet
afterwards, when they were gone, he took off his bonds.

IV\. The dismission of the rest of them. They came for corn, and corn
they had; and not only so, but every man had his money restored in his
sack's mouth. Thus Christ, our Joseph, gives out supplies without money
and without price. Therefore the poor are invited to buy, [Rev
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#017.md), [Rev
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#018.md). This put them into great
consternation ([Gen 42:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#028).md): Their
heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is
this that God hath done to us?

1\. It was really a merciful event; for I hope they had no wrong done to
them when they had their money given them back, but a kindness; yet they
were thus terrified by it. Note, (1.) Guilty consciences are apt to take
good providences in a bad sense, and to put wrong constructions even
upon those things that make for them. They flee when none pursues. (2.)
Wealth sometimes brings as much care along with it as want does, and
more too. If they had been robbed of their money, they could not have
been worse frightened than they were now when they found their money in
their sacks. Thus he whose ground brought forth plentifully said, What
shall I do? [Luk 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#017.md).

2\. Yet in their circumstances it was very amazing. They knew that the
Egyptians abhorred a Hebrew ([Gen
43:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#032).md), and therefore, since they
could not expect to receive any kindness from them, they concluded that
this was done with a design to pick a quarrel with them, and the rather
because the man, the lord of the land, had charged them as spies. Their
own consciences also were awake, and their sins set in order before
them; and this put them into confusion. Note, (1.) When men's spirits
are sinking every thing helps to sink them. (2.) When the events of
Providence concerning us are surprising it is good to enquire what it is
that God has done and is doing with us, and to consider the operation of
his hands.

[Genesis 42:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 42:29</span></span>

Here is, 1. The report which Jacob's sons made to their father of the
great distress they had been in in Egypt; how they had been suspected,
and threatened, and obliged to leave Simeon a prisoner there, till they
should bring Benjamin with them thither. Who would have thought of this
when they left home? When we go abroad we should consider how many sad
accidents, that we little think of, may befall us before we return home.
We know not what a day may bring forth; we ought therefore to be always
ready for the worst. 2. The deep impression this made upon the good man.
The very bundles of money which Joseph returned, in kindness to his
father, frightened him ([Gen 42:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#035).md);
for he concluded it was done with some mischievous design, or perhaps
suspected his own sons to have committed some offence, and so to have
run themselves into a praemunire - a penalty, which is intimated in what
he says ([Gen 42:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#036).md): Me have you
bereaved. He seems to lay the fault upon them; knowing their characters,
he feared they had provoked the Egyptians, and perhaps forcibly, or
fraudulently, brought home their money. Jacob is here much out of
temper. (1.) He has very melancholy apprehensions concerning the present
state of his family: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not; whereas Joseph
was in honour and Simeon in the way to it. Note, We often perplex
ourselves with our own mistakes, even in matters of fact. True griefs
may arise from false intelligence and suppositions, [Sa2
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#031.md). Jacob gives up Joseph for gone,
and Simeon and Benjamin as being in danger; and he concludes, All these
things are against me. It proved otherwise, that all these were for him,
were working together for his good and the good of his family: yet here
he thinks them all against him. Note, Through our ignorance and mistake,
and the weakness of our faith, we often apprehend that to be against us
which is really for us. We are afflicted in body, estate, name, and
relations; and we think all these things are against us, whereas these
are really working for us the weight of glory. (2.) He is at present
resolved that Benjamin shall not go down. Reuben will undertake to bring
him back in safety ([Gen 42:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#037).md), not
so much as putting in, If the Lord will, nor expecting the common
disasters of travellers; but he foolishly bids Jacob slay his two sons
(which, it is likely, he was very proud of) if he brought him not back;
as if the death of two grandsons could satisfy Jacob for the death of a
son. No, Jacob's present thoughts are, My son shall not go down with
you. He plainly intimates a distrust of them, remembering that he never
saw Joseph since he had been with them; therefore, "Benjamin shall not
go with you, by the way in which you go, for you will bring down my gray
hairs with sorrow to the grave." Note, It is bad with a family when
children conduct themselves so ill that their parents know not how to
trust them.
