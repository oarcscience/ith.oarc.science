### [Ezekiel Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 9:0</span></span>

The prophet had, in vision, seen the wickedness that was committed at
Jerusalem, in the foregoing chapter, and we may be sure that it was not
represented to him worse than really it was; now here follows, of
course, a representation of their ruin approaching; for when sin goes
before judgments come next. Here is, I. Preparation made of instruments
that were to be employed in the destruction of the city ([Eze
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#001.md), [Eze
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002).md). II. The removal of the Shechinah
from the cherubim to the threshold of the temple ([Eze
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#003).md). III. Orders given to one of the
persons employed, who is distinguished from the rest, for the marking of
a remnant to be preserved from the common destruction ([Eze
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#003.md), [Eze
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#004).md). IV. The warrant signed for the
execution of those that were not marked, and the execution begun
accordingly ([Eze 9:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#005).md). V. The
prophet's intercession for the mitigation of the sentence, and a denial
of any mitigation, the decree having now gone forth ([Eze
9:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#008).md). VI. The report made by him
that was to mark the pious remnant of what he had done in that matter
([Eze 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#011).md). And this shows a usual
method of Providence in the government of the world.

[Ezekiel 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 9:1</span></span>

In these verses we have,

I. The summons given to Jerusalem's destroyers to come forth and give
their attendance. He that appeared to the prophet ([Eze
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#002).md), that had brought him to
Jerusalem and had shown the wickedness that was done there, he cried,
Cause those that have charge over the city to draw near ([Eze
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#001).md), or, as it might better be read,
and nearer the original, Those that have charge over the city are
drawing near. He had said ([Eze 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#018).md),
I will deal in fury; now, says he to the prophet, thou shalt see who are
to be employed as the instruments of my wrath. Appropinquaverunt
visitationes civitatis - The visitations (or visitors) of the city are
at hand. They would not know the day of their visitations in mercy, and
now they are to be visited in wrath. Observe, 1. how the notice of this
is given to the prophet: He cried it in my ears with a loud voice, which
intimates the vehemency of him that spoke; when men are highly provoked,
and threaten in anger, they speak aloud. Those that regard not the
counsels God gives them in a still small voice shall be made to hear the
threatenings, to hear and tremble. It denotes also the prophet's
unwillingness to be told this: he was deaf on that ear, but there is no
remedy, their sin will not admit an excuse and therefore their judgment
will not admit a delay: "He cried it in my ears with a loud voice; he
made me hear it, and I heard it with a sad heart." 2. What this notice
is. There are those that have charge over the city to destroy it, not
the Chaldean armies, they are to be indeed employed in this work, but
they are not the visitors, they are only the servants, or tools rather.
God's angels have received a charge now to lay that city waste, which
they had long had a charge to protect and watch over. They are at hand,
as destroying angels, as ministers of wrath, for every man has his
destroying weapon in his hand, as the angel that kept the way of the
tree of life with a flaming sword. Note, Those that have by sin made God
their enemy have made the good angels their enemies too. These visitors
are called and caused to draw near. Note, God has ministers of wrath
always within call, always at command, invisible powers, by whom he
accomplishes is purposes. The prophet is made to see this in vision,
that he might with the greater assurance in his preaching denounce these
judgments. God told it him with a loud voice, taught it him with a
strong hand ([Isa 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#011).md), that it might
make the deeper impression upon him and that he might thus proclaim it
in the people's ears.

II\. Their appearance, upon this summons, is recorded. Immediately six
men came ([Eze 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002).md), one for each of
the principal gates of Jerusalem. Two destroying angels were sent
against Sodom, but six against Jerusalem; for Jerusalem's doom in the
judgment will be thrice as heavy as that of Sodom. There is an angel
watching at every gate to destroy, to bring in judgments from every
quarter, and to take heed that none escape. One angel served to destroy
the first-born of Egypt, and the camp of the Assyrians, but here are
six. In the Revelation we find seven that were to pour out the vials of
God's wrath, [Rev 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#001.md). They came with
every one a slaughter-weapon in his hand, prepared for the work to which
they were called. The nations of which the king of Babylon's army was
composed, which some reckon to be six, and the commanders of his army
(of whom six are named as principal, [Jer
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003).md), may be called the
slaughter-weapons in the hands of the angels. The angels are thoroughly
furnished for every service. 1. Observe whence they came - from the way
of the higher gate, which lies towards the north ([Eze
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002).md), either because the Chaldeans
came from the north ([Jer 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#014.md), Out of
the north an evil shall break forth) or because the image of jealousy
was set up at the door of the inner gate that looks towards the north,
[Eze 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#003.md), [Eze
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#005.md). At that gate of the temple the
destroying angels entered, to show what it was that opened the door to
them. Note, That way that sin lies judgments may be expected to come. 2.
Observe where they placed themselves: They went in and stood beside the
brazen altar, on which sacrifices were wont to be offered and atonement
made. When they acted as destroyers they acted as sacrificers, not from
any personal revenge or ill-will, but with a pure and sincere regard to
the glory of God; for to his justice all they slew were offered up as
victims. They stood by the altar, as it were to protect and vindicate
that, and plead its righteous cause, and avenge the horrid profanation
of it. At the altar they were to receive their commission to destroy, to
intimate that the iniquity of Jerusalem, like that of Eli's house, was
not to be purged by sacrifice.

III\. The notice taken of one among the destroying angels distinguished
in his habit from the rest, from whom some favour might be expected; it
should seem he was not one of the six, but among them, to see that mercy
was mixed with judgment, [Eze 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002.md).
This man was clothed with linen, as the priests were, and he had a
writer's inkhorn hanging at his side, as anciently attorneys and
lawyers' clerks had, which he was to make use of, as the other six were
to make use of their destroying weapons. Here the honours of the pen
exceeded those of the sword, but he was the Lord of angels that made use
of the writer's inkhorn; for it is generally agreed, among the best
interpreters, that this man represented Christ as Mediator saving those
that are his from the flaming sword of divine justice. He is our high
priest, clothed with holiness, for that was signified by the fine linen,
[Rev 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008.md). As prophet he wears the
writer's inkhorn. The book of life is the Lamb's book. The great things
of the law and gospel which God has written to us are of his writing;
for it is the Spirit of Christ, in the writers of the scripture, that
testifies to us, and the Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ. Note,
It is a matter of great comfort to all good Christians that, in the
midst of the destroyers and the destructions that are abroad, there is a
Mediator, a great high priest, who has an interest in heaven, and whom
saints on earth have an interest in.

IV\. The removal of the appearance of the divine glory from over the
cherubim. Some think this was that usual display of the divine glory
which was between the cherubim over the mercy seat, in the most holy
place, that took leave of them now, and never returned; for it is
supposed that it was not in the second temple. Others think it was that
display of the divine glory which the prophet now saw over the cherubim
in vision; and this is more probable, because this is called the glory
of the God of Israel ([Rev 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#004).md), and
this is it which he had now his eye upon; this was gone to the threshold
of the house, as it were to call to the servants that attended without
the door, to send them on their errand and give them their instructions.
And the removal of this, as well as the former, might be significant of
God's departure from them, and leaving them their house desolate; and
when God goes all good goes, but he goes from none till they first drive
him from them. He went at first no further than the threshold, that he
might show how loth he was to depart, and might give them both time and
encouragement to invite his return to them and his stay with them. Note,
God's departures from a people are gradual, but gracious souls are soon
award of the first step he takes towards a remove. Ezekiel immediately
observed that the glory of the god of Israel had gone up from the
cherub: and what is a vision of angels if God be gone?

V. The charge given to the man clothed in linen to secure the pious
remnant from the general desolation. We do not read that this Saviour
was summoned and sent for, as the destroyers were; for he is always
ready, appearing in the presence of God for us; and to him, as the most
proper person, the care of those that are marked for salvation is
committed, [Eze 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#004.md). Now observe, 1.
The distinguishing character of this remnant that is to be saved. They
are such as sigh and cry, sigh in themselves, as men in pain and
distress, cry to God in prayer, as men in earnest, because of all the
abominations that are committed in Jerusalem. It was not only the
idolatries they were guilty of, but all their other enormities, that
were abominations to God. These pious few had witnessed against those
abominations and had done what they could in their places to suppress
them; but, finding all their attempts for the reformation of manners
fruitless, they sat down, and sighted, and cried, wept in secret, and
complained to God, because of the dishonour done to his name by their
wickedness and the ruin it was bringing upon their church and nation.
Note, It is not enough that we do not delight in the sins of others, and
that we have not fellowship with them, but we must mourn for them, and
lay them to heart; we must grieve for that which we cannot help, as
those that hate sin for its own sake, and have a tender concern for the
souls of others, as David ([Psa
119:136](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#136).md), and Lot, who vexed his
righteous soul with the wicked conversation of his neighbours. The
abominations committed in Jerusalem are to be in a special manner
lamented, because they are in a particular manner offensive to God. 2.
The distinguishing care taken of them. Orders are given to find those
all out that are of such a pious public spirit: "Go through the midst of
the city in quest of them, and though they are ever so much dispersed,
and ever so closely hid from the fury of their persecutors, yet see that
you discover them, and set a mark upon their foreheads," (1.) To signify
that God owns them for his, and he will confess them another day. A work
of grace in the soul is to God a mark upon the forehead, which he will
acknowledge as his mark, and by which he knows those that are his. (2.)
To give to them who are thus marked an assurance of God's favour, that
they may know it themselves; and the comfort of knowing it will be the
most powerful support and cordial in calamitous times. Why should we
perplex ourselves about this temporal life if we know by the mark that
we have eternal life? (3.) To be a direction to the destroyers whom to
pass by, as the blood upon the door-posts was an indication that that
was an Israelite's house, and the first-born there must not be slain.
Note, Those who keep themselves pure in times of common iniquity God
will keep safe in times of common calamity. Those that distinguish
themselves shall be distinguished; those that cry for other men's sins
shall not need to cry for their own afflictions, for they shall be
either delivered from them or comforted under them. God will set a mark
upon his mourners, will book their sighs and bottle their tears. The
sealing of the servants of God in their foreheads mentioned in [Rev
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#003.md) was the same token of the care God
has of his own people with this related here; only this was to secure
them from being destroyed, that from being seduced, which is equivalent.

[Ezekiel 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 9:5</span></span>

In these verses we have,

I. A command given to the destroyers to do execution according to their
commission. They stood by the brazen altar, waiting for orders; and
orders are here given them to cut off and destroy all that were either
guilty of, or accessory to, the abominations of Jerusalem, and that did
not sigh and cry for them. Note, When God has gathered his wheat into
his garner nothing remains but to burn up the chaff, [Mat
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012.md).

1\. They are ordered to destroy all, (1.) Without exception. They must
go through the city, and smite; they must slay utterly, slay to
destruction, give them their death's wound. They must make no
distinction of age or sex, but cut off old and young; neither the beauty
of the virgins, nor the innocency of the babes, shall secure them. This
was fulfilled in the death of multitudes by famine and pestilence,
especially by the sword of the Chaldeans, as far as the military
execution went. Sometimes even such bloody work as this has been God's
work. But what an evil thing is sin, then, which provokes the God of
infinite mercy to such severity! (2.) Without compassion: "Let not your
eye spare, neither have you pity ([Eze
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#005).md); you must not save any whom God
has doomed to destruction, as Saul did Agag and the Amalekites, for that
is doing the work of God deceitfully, [Jer
48:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#010.md). None need to be more merciful
than God is; and he had said ([Eze
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#018).md), My eye shall not spare, neither
will I have pity." Note, Those that live in sin, and hate to be
reformed, will perish in sin, and deserve not to be pitied; for they
might easily have prevented the ruin, and would not.

2\. They are warned not to do the least hurt to those that were marked
for salvation: "Come not near any man upon whom is the mark; do not so
much as threaten or frighten any of them; it is promised them that there
shall no evil come nigh them, and therefore you must keep at a distance
from them." The king of Babylon gave particular orders that Jeremiah
should be protected. Baruch and Ebed-melech were secured, and, it is
likely, others of Jeremiah's friends, for his sake. God had promised
that it should go well with his remnant and they should be well treated
([Jer 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#011).md); and we have reason to
think that none of the mourning praying remnant fell by the sword of the
Chaldeans, but that God found out some way or other to secure them all,
as, in the last destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, the Christians
were all secured in a city called Pella, and none of them perished with
the unbelieving Jews. Note, None of those shall be lost whom God has
marked for life and salvation; for the foundation of God stands sure.

3\. They are directed to begin at the sanctuary ([Eze
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#006).md), that sanctuary which, in the
chapter before, he had seen the horrid profanation of; they must begin
there because there the wickedness began which provoked God to send
these judgments. The debaucheries of the priests were the poisoning of
the springs, to which all the corruption of the streams was owing. The
wickedness of the sanctuary was of all wickedness the most offensive to
God, and therefore there the slaughter must begin: "Begin there, to try
if the people will take warning by the judgments of God upon their
priests, and will repent and reform; begin there, that all the world may
see and know that the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God, and
hates sin most in those that are nearest to him." Note, When judgements
are abroad they commonly begin at the house of God, [Pe1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017.md). You only have I known, and
therefore I will punish you, [Amo 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#002.md).
God's temple is a sanctuary, a refuge and protection for penitent
sinners, but not for any that go on still in their trespasses; neither
the sacredness of the place nor the eminency of their place in it will
be their security. It should seem the destroyers made some difficulty of
putting men to death in the temple, but God bids them not to hesitate at
that, but ([Eze 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#007).md), Defile the
house, and fill the courts with slain. They will not be taken from the
altar (as was appointed by the law, [Exo
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#014).md), but think to secure themselves
by keeping hold of the horns of it, like Joab, and therefore, like him,
let them die there, [Kg1 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#030.md), [Kg1
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#031.md). There the blood of one of God's
prophets had been shed ([Mat 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035).md)
and therefore let their blood be shed. Note, If the servants of God's
house defile it with their idolatries, God will justly suffer the
enemies of it to defile it with their violences, [Psa
79:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001.md). But these acts of necessary
justice were really, whatever they were ceremonially, rather a
purification than a pollution of the sanctuary; it was putting away evil
from among them. 4. They are appointed to go forth into the city, [Eze
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#006.md), [Eze
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#007.md). Note, Wherever sin has gone
before judgement will follow after; and, though judgement begins at the
house of God, yet it shall not end there. The holy city shall be no more
a protection to the wicked people then the holy house was to the wicked
priests.

II\. Here is execution done accordingly. They observed their orders,
and, 1. They began at the elders, the ancient men that were before the
house, and slew them first, either those seventy ancients who worshipped
idols in their chambers ([Eze 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#012).md) or
those twenty-five who worshipped the sun between the porch and the
altar, who might more properly be said to be before the house. Note,
Ringleaders in sin may expect to be first met with by the judgements of
God; and the sins of those who are in the most eminent and public
stations call for the most exemplary punishments. 2. They proceeded to
the common people: They went forth and slew in the city; for, when the
decree has gone forth, there shall be no delay; if God begin, he will
make an end.

III\. Here is the prophet's intercession for a mitigation of the
judgement, and a reprieve for some ([Eze
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#008).md): While they were slaying them,
and I was left, I fell upon my face. Observe here, 1. How sensible the
prophet was of God's mercy to him, in that he was spared when so many
round about him were cut off. Thousands fell on his right hand, and on
his left, and yet the destruction did not come nigh him; only with his
eyes did he behold the just reward of the wicked, [Psa
91:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#007.md), [Psa
91:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#008.md). He speaks as one that narrowly
escaped the destruction, attributing it to God's goodness, not his own
deserts. Note, The best saints must acknowledge themselves indebted to
sparing mercy that they are not consumed. And when desolating judgements
are abroad, and multitudes fall by them, it ought to be accounted a
great favor if we have our lives given us for a prey; for we might
justly have perished with those that perished. 2. Observe how he
improved this mercy; he looked upon it that therefore he was left that
he might stand in the gap to turn away the wrath of God. Note, We must
look upon it that for this reason we are spared, that we may do good in
our places, may do good by our prayers. Ezekiel did not triumph in the
slaughter he made, but his flesh trembled for the fear of God, (as
David's, [Psa 119:120](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#120).md); he fell on his
face, and cried, not in fear for himself (he was one of those that were
marked), but in compassion to his fellow-creatures. Those that sigh and
cry for the sins of sinners cannot but sigh and cry for their miseries
too; yet the day is coming when all this concern will be entirely
swallowed up in a full satisfaction in this, that God is glorified; and
those that now fall on their faces, and cry, Ah! Lord God, will lift up
their heads, and sing, Hallelujah, [Rev
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001.md), [Rev
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#003.md). The prophet humbly expostulates
with God: "Wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel, and shall there
be none left but the few that are marked? Shall the Israel of God be
destroyed, utterly destroyed? When there are but a few left shall those
be cut off, who might have been the seed of another generation? And will
the God of Israel be himself their destroyer? Wilt thou now destroy
Israel, who wast wont to protect and deliver Israel? Wilt thou so pour
out thy fury upon Jerusalem as by the total destruction of the city to
ruin the whole country too? Surely thou wilt not!" Note, Though we
acknowledge that God is righteous, yet we have leave to plead with him
concerning his judgements, [Jer 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001.md).

IV\. Here is God's denial of the prophet's request for a mitigation of
the judgement and his justification of himself in that denial, [Eze
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#009.md), [Eze
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#010.md). 1. Nothing could be said in
extenuation of this sin. God was willing to show mercy as the prophet
could desire; he always is so. But here the case will not admit of it;
it is such that mercy cannot be granted without wrong to justice; and it
is not fit that one attribute of God should be glorified at the expense
of another. Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that he should destroy,
especially that he should destroy Israel? By no means. But the truth is
their crimes are so flagrant that the reprieve of the sinners would be a
connivance at the sin: "The iniquity of the house of Judah and Israel is
exceedingly great; there is no suffering them to go on at this rate. The
land is filled with the innocent blood, and, when the city courts are
appealed to for the defence of injured innocency, the remedy is as bad
as the disease, for the city is full of perverseness, or wrestling of
judgement; and that which they support themselves with in this iniquity
is the same atheistical profane principle with which they flattered
themselves in their idolatry, [Eze
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#012.md). The Lord has forsaken the earth,
and left it to us to do what we will in it; he will not intermeddle in
the affairs of it; and, whatever wrong we do, he sees not; he either
knows it not, or will not take cognizance of it." Now how can those
expect benefit by the mercy of God who thus bid defiance to his justice?
No; nothing can be offered by an advocate in excuse of the crimes while
the criminal puts in such a plea as this in his own vindication; and
therefore. 2. Nothing can be done to mitigate the sentence ([Eze
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#010).md): "Whatever thou thinkest of it,
as for me, my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; I have
borne with them as long as it was fit that such impudent sinners should
be borne with; and therefore now I will recompense their way on their
head." Note, Sinners sink and perish under the weight of their own sins;
it is their own way, which they deliberately chose rather than the way
of God, and which they obstinately persisted in, in contempt of the word
of God, that is recompensed on them. Great iniquities justify God in
great severities; nay, he is ready to justify himself, as he does here
to the prophet, for he will be clear when he judges.

V. Here is a return made of the writ of protection which was issued out
for the securing of those that mourned in Zion ([Eze
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#011).md): The man clothed with linen
reported the matter, gave an account of what he had done in pursuance of
his commission; he had found out all that mourned in secret for the sins
of the land, and cried out against them by a public testimony, and had
marked them all in the forehead. Lord, I have done as thou hast
commanded me. We do not find that those who were commissioned to destroy
reported what destruction they had made, but he who was appointed to
protect reported his matter; for it would be more pleasing both to God
and to the prophet to hear of those that were saved than of those that
perished. Or this report was made now because the thing was finished,
whereas the destroying work would be a work of time, and when it was
brought to an end then the report should be made. See how faithful
Christ is to the trust reposed in him. Is he commanded to secure eternal
life to the chosen remnant? He has done as was commanded him. Of all
that thou hast given me I have lost none.
