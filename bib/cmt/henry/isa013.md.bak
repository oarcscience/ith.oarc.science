### [Isaiah Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 13:0</span></span>

Hitherto the prophecies of this book related only to Judah and Israel,
and Jerusalem especially; but now the prophet begins to look abroad, and
to read the doom of divers of the neighbouring states and kingdoms: for
he that is King of saints is also King of nations, and rules in the
affairs of the children of men as well as in those of his own children.
But the nations to whom these prophecies do relate were all such as the
people of God were in some way or other conversant and concerned with,
such as had been kind or unkind to Israel, and accordingly God would
deal with them, either in favour or in wrath; for the Lord's portion is
his people, and to them he has an eye in all the dispensations of his
providence concerning those about them, [Deu
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008.md), [Deu
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009.md). The threatenings we find here
against Babylon, Moab, Damascus, Egypt, Tyre, etc., were intended for
comfort to those in Israel that feared God, but were terrified and
oppressed by those potent neighbours, and for alarm to those among them
that were wicked. If God would thus severely reckon with those for their
sins that knew him not, and made no profession of his name, how severe
would he be with those that were called by his name and yet lived in
rebellion against him! And perhaps the directing of particular
prophecies to the neighbouring nations might invite some of those
nations to the reading of the Jews' Bible, and so they might be brought
to their religion. This chapter, and that which follows, contain what
God had to say to Babylon and Babylon's king, who were at present little
known to Israel, but would in process of time become a greater enemy to
them than any other had been, for which God would at last reckon with
them. In this chapter we have, I. A general rendezvous of the forces
that were to be employed against Babylon ([Isa
13:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001).md). II. The dreadfully bloody
work that those forces should make in Babylon ([Isa
13:6-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#006).md). III. The utter ruin and
desolation of Babylon, which this should end in ([Isa
13:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019).md).

[Isaiah 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 13:1</span></span>

The general title of this book was, The vision of Isaiah the son of
Amoz, [Isa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md). Here we have that
which Isaiah saw, which was represented to his mind as clearly and fully
as if he had seen it with his bodily eyes; but the particular
inscription of this sermon is the burden of Babylon. 1. It is a burden,
a lesson they were to learn (so some understand it), but they would be
loth to learn it, and it would be a burden to their memories, or a load
which should lie heavily upon them and under which they should sink.
Those that will not make the word of God their rest ([Isa
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#012.md); [Jer
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#016).md) shall find it made a burden to
them. 2. It is the burden of Babylon or Babel, which at this time was a
dependent upon the Assyrian monarchy (the metropolis of which was
Nineveh), but soon after revolted from it and became a monarchy of
itself, and a very potent one, in Nebuchadnezzar. This prophet
afterwards foretold the captivity of the Jews in Babylon, [Isa
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#006.md). Here he foretels the reprisals
God would make upon Babylon for the wrongs done to his people. In these
verses a summons is given to those powerful and warlike nations whom God
would make us of as the instruments of his wrath for the destruction of
Babylon: he afterwards names them ([Isa
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#017).md) the Medes, who, in conjunction
with the Persians, under the command of Darius and Cyrus, were the ruin
of the Babylonian monarchy.

I. The place doomed to destruction is Babylon; it is here called the
gates of the nobles ([Isa 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#002).md),
because of the abundance of noblemen's houses that were in it, stately
ones and richly furnished, which would invite the enemy to come, in
hopes of a rich booty. The gates of nobles were strong and well guarded,
and yet they would be no fence against those who came with commission to
execute God's judgments. Before his power and wrath palaces are no more
than cottages. Nor is it only the gates of the nobles, but the whole
land, that is doomed to destruction ([Isa
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#005).md); for, though the nobles were the
leaders in persecuting and oppressing God's people, yet the whole land
concurred with them in it.

II\. The persons brought together to lay Babylon waste are here called,
1. God's sanctified ones ([Isa 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#003).md),
designed for this service and set apart to it by the purpose and
providence of God, disengaged from other projects, that they might
wholly apply themselves to this, such as were qualified for that to
which they were called, for what work God employs men in he does in some
measure fit them for. It intimates likewise that in God's intention,
though not in theirs, it was a holy war; they designed only the
enlargement of their own empire, but God designed the release of his
people and a type of the destruction of the New Testament Babylon.
Cyrus, the person principally concerned, was justly called a sanctified
one, for he was God's anointed ([Isa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001).md) and a figure of him that was to
come. It is a pity but all soldiers, especially those that fight the
Lord's battles, should be in the strictest sense sanctified ones; and it
is a wonder that those dare be profane ones who carry their lives in
their hands. 2. They are called God's mighty ones, because they had
their might from God and were now to use it for him. It is said of Cyrus
that in this expedition God held his right hand, [Isa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md). God's sanctified ones are his
mighty ones. Those whom God calls he qualifies; and those whom he makes
holy he makes strong in spirit. 3. They are said to rejoice in his
highness, that is, to serve his glory and the purposes of it with great
alacrity. Though Cyrus did not know God, nor actually design his honour
in what he did, yet God used him as his servant ([Isa
45:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#004.md), I have surnamed thee as my
servant, though thou hast not known me), and he rejoiced in those
successes by which God exalted his own name. 4. They are very numerous,
a multitude, a great people, kingdoms of nations ([Isa
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#004).md), not rude and barbarous, but
modelled and regular troops, such as are furnished out by well-ordered
kingdoms. The great God has hosts at his command. 5. They are
far-fetched: They come from a far country, from the end of heaven. The
vast country of Assyria lay between Babylon and Persia. God can make
those a scourge and ruin to his enemies that lie most remote from them
and therefore are least dreaded.

III\. The summons given them is effectual, their obedience ready, and
they make a very formidable appearance: A banner is lifted up upon the
high mountain, [Isa 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#002.md). God's
standard is set up, a flag of defiance hung out against Babylon. It is
erected on high, where all may see it; whoever will may come and enlist
themselves under it, and they shall be taken immediately into God's pay.
Those that beat up for volunteers must exalt the voice in making
proclamation, to encourage soldiers to come in; they must shake the
hand, to beckon those at a distance and to animate those that have
enlisted themselves. And they shall not do this in vain; God has
commanded and called those whom he designs to make use of ([Isa
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#003).md) and power goes along with his
calls and commands, which cannot be resisted. He that makes men able to
serve him can, when he pleases, make them willing too. It is the Lord of
hosts that musters the host of the battle, [Isa
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#004.md). He raises them, brings them
together, puts them in order, reviews them, has an exact account of them
in his muster-roll, sees that they be all in their respective posts, and
gives them their necessary orders. Note, All the hosts of war are under
the command of the Lord of hosts; and that which makes them truly
formidable is that, when they come against Babylon, the Lord comes, and
brings them with him as the weapons of his indignation, [Isa
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#005.md). Note, Great princes and armies
are but tools in God's hand, weapons that he is pleased to make use of
in doing his work, and it is his wrath that arms them and gives them
success.

[Isaiah 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 13:6</span></span>

We have here a very elegant and lively description of the terrible
confusion and desolation which should be made in Babylon by the descent
which the Medes and Persians should make upon it. Those that were now
secure and easy were bidden to howl and make sad lamentation; for,

I. God was about to appear in wrath against them, and it is a fearful
thing to fall into his hands: The day of the Lord is at hand ([Isa
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#006).md), a little day of judgment, when
God will act as a just avenger of his own and his people's injured
cause. And there are those who will have reason to tremble when that day
is at hand. The day of the Lord cometh, [Isa
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#009.md). Men have their day now, and they
think to carry the day; but God laughs at them, for he sees that his day
is coming, [Psa 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#013.md). Fury is not
with God, and yet his day of reckoning with the Babylonians is said to
be cruel with wrath and fierce anger. God will deal in severity with
them for the severities they exercised upon God's people; with the
froward, with the cruel, he will show himself froward, will show himself
cruel, and give the blood-thirsty blood to drink.

II\. Their hearts shall fail them, and they shall have neither courage
nor comfort left; they shall not be able either to resist the judgment
coming or to bear up under it, either to oppose the enemy or to support
themselves, [Isa 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#007.md), [Isa
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#008.md). Those that in the day of their
peace were proud, and haughty, and terrible ([Isa
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#011).md), shall, when trouble comes, be
quite dispirited and at their wits' end: All hands shall be faint, and
unable to hold a weapon, and every man's heart shall melt, so that they
shall be ready to die for fear. The pangs of their fear shall be like
those of a woman in hard labour, and they shall be amazed one at
another. In frightening themselves, they shall frighten one another;
they shall wonder to see those tremble that used to be bold and daring;
or they shall be amazed looking one at another, as men at a loss, [Gen
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#001.md). Their faces shall be as flames,
pale as flames, through fear (so some), or red as flames sometimes are,
blushing at their own cowardice; or their faces shall be as faces
scorched with the flame, or as theirs that labour in the fire, their
visage blacker than a coal, or like a bottle in the smoke, [Psa
119:83](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#083.md).

III\. All comfort and hope shall fail them ([Isa
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#010).md): The stars of heaven shall not
give their light, but shall be clouded and overcast; the sun shall be
darkened in his going forth, rising bright, but lost again, a certain
sign of foul weather. They shall be as men in distress at sea, when
neither sun nor stars appear, [Act
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#020.md). It shall be as dreadful a time
with them as it would be with the earth if all the heavenly luminaries
were turned into darkness, a resemblance of the day of judgment, when
the sun shall be turned into darkness. The heavens frowning thus is an
indication of the displeasure of the God of heaven. When things look
dark on earth, yet it is well enough if all be clear upwards; but, if we
have no comfort thence, wherewith shall we be comforted?

IV\. God will visit them for their iniquity; and all this is intended
for the punishment of sin, and particularly the sin of pride, [Isa
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#011.md). This puts wormwood and gall
into the affliction and misery, 1. That sin must now have its
punishment. Though Babylon be a little world, yet, being a wicked world,
it shall not go unpunished. Sin brings desolation on the world of the
ungodly; and when the kingdoms of the earth are quarrelling with one
another it is the fruit of God's controversy with them all. 2. That
pride must now have its fall: The haughtiness of the terrible must now
be laid low, particularly of Nebuchadnezzar and his son Belshazzar, who
had, in their pride, trampled upon, and made themselves very terrible
to, the people of God. A man's pride will bring him low.

V. There shall be so great a slaughter as will produce a scarcity of men
([Isa 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#012).md): I will make a man more
precious than fine gold. You could not have a man to be employed in any
of the affairs of state, not a man to be enlisted in the army, not a man
to match a daughter to, for the building up of a family, if you would
give any money for one. The troops of the neighbouring nations would not
be hired into the service of the king of Babylon, because they saw every
thing go against him. Populous countries are soon depopulated by war.
And God can soon make a kingdom that has been courted and admired to be
dreaded and shunned by all, as a house that is falling, or a ship that
is sinking.

VI\. There shall be a universal confusion and consternation, such a
confusion of their affairs that it shall be like the shaking of the
heavens with dreadful thunders and the removing of the earth by no less
dreadful earthquakes. All shall go to rack and ruin in the day of the
wrath of the Lord of hosts, [Isa
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#013.md). And such a consternation shall
seize their spirits that Babylon, which used to be like a roaring lion
and a raging bear to all about her, shall become as a chased roe and as
a sheep that no man takes up, [Isa
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#014.md). The army they shall bring into
the field, consisting of troops of divers nations (as great armies
usually do), shall be so dispirited by their own apprehensions and so
dispersed by their enemies' sword that they shall turn every man to his
own people; each man shall shift for his own safety; the men of might
shall not find their hands ([Psa
76:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#005).md), but take to their heels.

VII\. There shall be a general scene of blood and horror, as is usual
where the sword devours. No wonder that every one makes the best of his
way, since the conqueror gives no quarter, but puts all to the sword,
and not those only that are found in arms, as is usual with us even in
the most cruel slaughters ([Isa
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#015).md): Every one that is found alive
shall be run through, as soon as ever it appears that he is a
Babylonian. Nay, because the sword devours one as well as another, every
one that is joined to them shall fall by the sword; those of other
nations that come in to their assistance shall be cut off with them. It
is dangerous being in bad company, and helping those whom God is about
to destroy. Those particularly that join themselves to Babylon must
expect to share in her plagues, [Rev
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004.md). And, since the most sacred laws
of nature, and of humanity itself, are silenced by the fury of war
(though they cannot be cancelled), the conquerors shall, in the most
barbarous brutish manner, dash the children to pieces, and ravish the
wives. Jusque datum sceleri - Wickedness shall have free course, [Isa
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#016.md). They had thus dealt with God's
people ([Lam 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#011).md), and now they shall
be paid in their own coin, [Rev 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#010.md).
It was particularly foretold ([Psa
137:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#009).md) that the little ones of Babylon
should be dashed against the stones. How cruel soever and unjust those
were that did it, God was righteous who suffered it to be done, and to
be done before their eyes, to their greater terror and vexation. It was
just also that the houses which they had filled with the spoil of Israel
should be spoiled and plundered. What is got by rapine is often lost in
the same manner.

VIII\. The enemy that God will send against them shall be inexorable,
probably being by some provocation or other more than ordinarily
exasperated against them; or, in whatever way it may be brought about,
God himself will stir up the Medes to use this severity with the
Babylonians. He will not only serve his own purposes by their
dispositions and designs, but will put it into their hearts to make this
attempt upon Babylon, and suffer them to prosecute it with all this
fury. God is not the author of sin, but he would not permit it if he did
not know how to bring glory to himself out of it. These Medes, in
conjunction with the Persians, shall make thorough work of it; for, 1.
They shall take no bribes, [Isa 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#017.md).
All that men have they would give for their lives, but the Medes shall
not regard silver; it is blood they thirst for, not gold; no man's
riches shall with them be the ransom of his life. 2. They shall show no
pity ([Isa 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#018).md), not to the young
men that are in the prime of their time - they shall shoot them through
with their bows, and then dash them to pieces; not to the age of
innocency - they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb, nor spare
little children, whose cries and frights one would think should make
even marble eyes to weep, and hearts of adamant to relent. Pause a
little here and wonder, (1.) That men should be thus cruel and inhuman,
and so utterly divested of all compassion; and in it see how corrupt and
degenerate the nature of man has become. (2.) That the God of infinite
mercy should suffer it, nay, and should make it to be the execution of
his justice, which shows that, though he is gracious, yet he is the God
to whom vengeance belongs. (3.) That little infants, who have never been
guilty of any actual sin, should be thus abused, which shows that there
is an original guilt by which life is forfeited as soon as it is had.

[Isaiah 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 13:19</span></span>

The great havoc and destruction which it was foretold should be made by
the Medes and Persians in Babylon here end in the final destruction of
it. 1. It is allowed that Babylon was a noble city. It was the glory of
kingdoms and the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency; it was that head of
gold ([Dan 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#037.md), [Dan
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#038).md); it was called the lady of
kingdoms ([Isa 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#005).md), the praise of
the whole earth ([Jer 51:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#041).md), like a
pleasant roe (so the word signifies); but it shall be as a chased roe,
[Isa 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#014.md). The Chaldeans gloried in
the beauty and wealth of this their metropolis. 2. It is foretold that
it should be wholly destroyed, like Sodom and Gomorrah; not so
miraculously, nor so suddenly, but as effectually, though gradually; and
the destruction should come upon them as that upon Sodom, when they were
secure, eating and drinking, [Luk
17:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#028.md), [Luk
17:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#029.md). Babylon was taken when
Belshazzar was in his revels; and, though Cyrus and Darius did not
demolish it, yet by degrees it wasted away and in process of time it
went all to ruin. It is foretold here ([Isa
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#020).md) that it shall never be
inhabited; in Adrian's time nothing remained but the wall. And whereas
it is prophesied concerning Nineveh, that great city, that when it
should be deserted and left desolate yet flocks should lie down in the
midst of it, it is here said concerning Babylon that the Arabians, who
were shepherds, should not make their folds there; the country about
should be so barren that there would be no grazing there; no, not for
sheep. Nay, it shall be the receptacle of wild beasts, that affect
solitude; the houses of Babylon, where the sons and daughters of
pleasure used to rendezvous, shall be full of doleful creatures, owls
and satyrs, that are themselves frightened thither, as to a place proper
for them, and by whom all others are frightened thence. Historians say
that this was fulfilled in the letter. Benjamin Bar-Jona, in his
Itinerary, speaking of Babel, has these words: "This is that Babel which
was of old thirty miles in breadth; it is now laid waste. There are yet
to be seen the ruins of a palace of Nebuchadnezzar, but the sons of men
dare not enter in, for fear of serpents and scorpions, which possess the
place." Let none be proud of their pompous palaces, for they know not
but they may become worse than cottages; nor let any think that their
houses shall endure for ever ([Psa
49:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#011).md), when perhaps nothing may
remain but the ruins and reproaches of them. 3. It is intimated that
this destruction should come shortly ([Isa
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022).md): Her time is near to come. This
prophecy of the destruction of Babylon was intended for the support and
comfort of the people of God when they were captives there and
grievously oppressed; and the accomplishment of the prophecy was nearly
200 years after the time when it was delivered; yet it followed soon
after the time for which it was calculated. When the people of Israel
were groaning under the heavy yoke of Babylonish tyranny, sitting down
in tears by the rivers of Babylon and upbraided with the songs of Zion,
when their insolent oppressors were most haughty and arrogant ([Isa
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#011).md), then let them know, for their
comfort, that Babylon's time, her day to fall, is near to come, and the
days of her prosperity shall not be prolonged, as they have been. When
God begins with her he will make an end. Thus it is said of the
destruction of the New Testament Babylon, whereof the former was a type,
In one hour has her judgment come.
