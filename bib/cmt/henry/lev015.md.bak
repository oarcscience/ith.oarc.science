### [Leviticus Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 15:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have laws concerning other ceremonial uncleannesses
contracted either by bodily disease like that of the leper, or some
natural incidents, and this either, I. In men (v. 1-18). Or, II. In
women ([Lev 15:19-33](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#019).md). We need not be
at all curious in explaining these antiquated laws, it is enough if we
observe the general intention; but we have need to be very cautious lest
sin take occasion by the commandment to become more exceedingly sinful;
and exceedingly sinful it is when lust is kindled by sparks of fire from
God's altar. The case is bad with the soul when it is putrefied by that
which should purify it.

[Leviticus 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 15:1</span></span>

We have here the law concerning the ceremonial uncleanness that was
contracted by running issues in men. It is called in the margin ([Lev
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#002).md) the running of the reins: a very
grievous and loathsome disease, which was, usually the effect and
consequent of wantonness and uncleanness, and a dissolute course of
life, filling men's bones with the sins of their youth, and leaving them
to mourn at the last, when all the pleasures of their wickedness have
vanished, and nothing remains but the pain and anguish of a rotten
carcase and a wounded conscience. And what fruit has the sinner then of
those things whereof he has so much reason to be ashamed? [Rom
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#021.md). As modesty is an ornament of
grace to the head and chains about the neck, so chastity is health to
the navel and marrow to the bones; but uncleanness is a wound and
dishonour, the consumption of the flesh and the body, and a sin which is
often its own punishment more than any other. It was also sometimes
inflicted by the righteous hand of God for other sins, as appears by
David's imprecation of a curse upon the family of Joab, for the murder
of Abner. [Sa2 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#029.md), Let there not
fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or is a leper. A
vile disease for vile deserts. Now whoever had this disease upon him, 1.
He was himself unclean, [Lev 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#002.md). He
must not dare to come near the sanctuary, it was at his peril if he did,
nor might he eat of the holy things. This signified the filthiness of
sin, and of all the productions of our corrupt nature, which render us
odious to God's holiness, and utterly unfit for communion with him. Out
of a pure heart well kept are the issues of life ([Pro
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#023).md), but out of an unclean heart
comes that which is defiling, [Mat
12:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#034.md), [Mat
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#035.md). 2. He made every person and
thing unclean that he touched, or that touched him, [Lev
15:4-12](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#004.md). His bed, and his chair, and
his saddle, and every thing that belonged to him, could not be touched
without a ceremonial uncleanness contracted, which a man must remain
conscious to himself of till sunset, and from which he could not be
cleansed without washing his clothes, and bathing his flesh in water.
This signified the contagion of sin, the danger we are in of being
polluted by conversing with those that are polluted, and the need we
have with the utmost circumspection to save ourselves from this untoward
generation. 3. When he was cured of the disease, yet he could not be
cleansed from the pollution without a sacrifice, for which he was to
prepare himself by seven days' expectation after he was perfectly clear
from his distemper, and by bathing in spring water, [Lev
15:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#013.md). This signified the great
gospel duties of faith and repentance, and the great gospel privileges
of the application of Christ's blood to our souls for our justification
and his grace for our sanctification. God has promised to sprinkle clean
water upon us, and to cleanse us from all our filthiness, and has
appointed us by repentance to wash and make ourselves clean: he has also
provided a sacrifice of atonement, and requires us by faith to interest
ourselves in that sacrifice; for it is the blood of Christ his Son that
cleanses us from all sin, and by which atonement is made for us, that we
may have admission into God's presence and may partake of his favour.

[Leviticus 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 15:19</span></span>

This is concerning the ceremonial uncleanness which women lay under from
their issues, both those that were regular and healthful, and according
to the course of nature ([Lev
15:19-24](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#019).md), and those that were
unseasonable, excessive, and the disease of the body; such was the
bloody issue of that poor woman who was suddenly cured by touching the
hem of Christ's garment, after she had lain twelve years under her
distemper, and had spent her estate upon physicians and physic in vain.
This made the woman that was afflicted with it unclean ([Lev
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#025).md) and every thing she touched
unclean, [Lev 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#026.md), [Lev
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#027.md). And if she was cured, and found
by seven days' trial that she was perfectly free from her issue of
blood, she was to be cleansed by the offering of two turtle-doves or two
young pigeons, to make an atonement for her, [Lev
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#028.md), [Lev
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#029.md). All wicked courses,
particularly idolatries, are compared to the uncleanness of a removed
woman ([Eze 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#017).md), and, in allusion
to this, it is said of Jerusalem ([Lam
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#009).md), Her filthiness is in her skirts,
so that (as it follows, [Lev 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#017).md)
she was shunned as a menstruous woman.

I. The reasons given for all these laws (which we are ready to think
might very well have been spared) we have, [Lev
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#031.md). 1. Thus shall you separate the
children of Israel (for to them only and their servants and proselytes
these laws pertained) from their uncleanness; that is, (1.) By these
laws they were taught their privilege and honour, that they were
purified unto God a peculiar people, and were intended by the holy God
for a kingdom of priests, a holy nation; for that was a defilement to
them which was not so to others. (2.) They were also taught their duty,
which was to preserve the honour of their purity, and to keep themselves
from all sinful pollutions. It was easy for them to argue that if those
pollutions which were natural, unavoidable, involuntary, their
affliction and not their sin, rendered them for the time so odious that
they were not fit for communion either with God or man, much more
abominable and filthy were they if they sinned against the light and law
of nature, by drunkenness, adultery, fraud, and the like sins, which
defile the very mind and conscience. And, if these ceremonial pollutions
could not be done away but by sacrifice and offering, something greater
and much more valuable must be expected and depended upon for the
purifying of the soul from the uncleanness of sin. 2. Thus their dying
in their uncleanness by the hand of God's justice, if while they were
under any of these defilements they should come near the sanctuary,
would be prevented. Note, It is a dangerous thing to die in our
uncleanness; and it is our own fault if we do, since we have not only
fair warning given us, by God's law, against those things that will
defile us, but also such gracious provision made by his gospel for our
cleansing if at any time we be defiled. 3. In all these laws there seems
to be a special regard had to the honour of the tabernacle, to which
none must approach in their uncleanness, that they defile not my
tabernacle. Infinite Wisdom took this course to preserve in the minds of
that careless people a continual dread of, and veneration for, the
manifestations of God's glory and presence among them in his sanctuary.
Now that the tabernacle of God was with men familiarity would be apt to
breed contempt, and therefore the law made so many things of frequent
incidence to be ceremonial pollutions, and to involve an incapacity of
drawing near to the sanctuary (making death the penalty), that so they
might not approach without great caution, and reverence, and serious
preparation, and fear of being found unfit. Thus they were taught never
to draw near to God but with an awful humble sense of their distance and
danger, and an exact observance of every thing that was required in
order to their safety and acceptance.

II\. And what duty must we learn from all this? 1. Let us bless God that
we are not under the yoke of these carnal ordinances, that, as nothing
can destroy us, so nothing can defile us, but sin. Those may now partake
of the Lord's supper who durst not then eat of the peace-offerings. And
the defilement we contract by our sins of daily infirmity we may be
cleansed from in secret by the renewed acts of repentance and faith,
without bathing in water or bringing an offering to the door of the
tabernacle. 2. Let us carefully abstain from all sin, as defiling to the
conscience, and particularly from all fleshly lusts, possessing our
vessel in sanctification and honour, and not in the lusts of
uncleanness, which not only pollute the soul, but war against it, and
threaten its ruin. 3. Let us all see how indispensably necessary real
holiness is to our future happiness, and get our hearts purified by
faith, that we may see God. Perhaps it is in allusion to these laws
which forbade the unclean to approach the sanctuary that when it is
asked, Who shall stand in God's holy place? it is answered, He that hath
clean hands and a pure heart ([Psa
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#003.md), [Psa
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004).md); for without holiness no man
shall see the Lord.
