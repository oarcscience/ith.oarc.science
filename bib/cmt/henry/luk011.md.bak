### [Luke Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#001.md)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 11:0</span></span>

In this chapter, I. Christ teaches his disciples to pray, and quickens
and encourages them to be frequent, instant, and importunate in prayer
([Luk 11:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#001).md). II. He fully answers
the blasphemous imputation of the Pharisees, who charged him with
casting out devils by virtue of a compact and confederacy with
Beelzebub, the prince of the devils, and shows the absurdity and
wickedness of it ([Luk 11:14-26](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#014).md). III.
He shows the honour of obedient disciples to be greater than that of his
own mother ([Luk 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#027.md), [Luk
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#028).md). IV. He upbraids the men of
that generation for their infidelity and obstinacy, notwithstanding all
the means of conviction offered to them ([Luk
11:29-36](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#029).md). V. He severely reproves the
Pharisees and consciences of those that submitted to them, and their
hating and persecuting those that witnessed against their wickedness (v.
37-54).

[Luke 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 11:1</span></span>

Prayer is one of the great laws of natural religion. That man is a
brute, is a monster, that never prays, that never gives glory to his
Maker, nor feels his favour, nor owns his dependence upon him. One great
design therefore of Christianity is to assist us in prayer, to enforce
the duty upon us, to instruct us in it, and encourage us to expect
advantage by it. Now here,

I. We find Christ himself praying in a certain place, probably where he
used to pray, [Luk 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#001.md). As God, he
was prayed to; as man, he prayed; and, though he was a Son, yet learned
he this obedience. This evangelist has taken particular notice of
Christ's praying often, more than any other of the evangelists: when he
was baptized ([Luk 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#021).md), he was
praying; he withdrew into the wilderness, and prayed ([Luk
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#016).md); he went out into a mountain to
pray, and continued all night in prayer ([Luk
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#012).md); he was alone praying ([Luk
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#018).md); soon after, he went up into a
mountain to pray, and as he prayed he was transfigured ([Luk
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#028.md), [Luk
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#029).md); and here he was praying in a
certain place. Thus, like a genuine son of David, he gave himself unto
prayer, [Psa 109:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#004.md). Whether Christ was
now alone praying, and the disciples only knew that he was so, or
whether he prayed with them, is uncertain; it is most probable that they
were joining with him.

II\. His disciples applied themselves to him for direction in prayer.
When he was praying, they asked, Lord, teach us to pray. Note, The gifts
and graces of others should excite us to covet earnestly the same. Their
zeal should provoke us to a holy imitation and emulation; why should not
we do as well as they? Observe, They came to him with this request, when
he ceased; for they would not disturb him when he was at prayer, no, not
with this good motion. Every thing is beautiful in its season. One of
his disciples, in the name of the rest, and perhaps by their
appointment, said, Lord, teach us. Note, Though Christ is apt to teach,
yet he will for this be enquired of, and his disciples must attend him
for instruction.

Now, 1. Their request is, "Lord, teach us to pray; give us a rule or
model by which to go in praying, and put words into our mouths." Note,
It becomes the disciples of Christ to apply themselves to him for
instruction in prayer. Lord, teach us to pray, is itself a good prayer,
and a very needful one, for it is a hard thing to pray well and it is
Jesus Christ only that can teach us, by his word and Spirit, how to
pray. "Lord, teach me what it is to pray; Lord, excite and quicken me to
the duty; Lord, direct me what to pray for; Lord, give me praying
graces, that I may serve God acceptably in prayer; Lord, teach me to
pray in proper words; give me a mouth and wisdom in prayer, that I may
speak as I ought; teach me what I shall say."

2\. Their plea is, "As John also taught his disciples. He took care to
instruct his disciples in this necessary duty, and we would be taught as
they were, for we have a better Master than they had." Dr. Lightfoot's
notion of this is, That whereas the Jews' prayers were generally
adorations, and praises of God, and doxologies, John taught his
disciples such prayers as were more filled up with petitions and
requests; for it is said of them that they did deēseis poiountai - make
prayers, [Luk 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#033.md). The word signifies
such prayers as are properly petitionary. "Now, Lord, teach us this, to
be added to those benedictions of the name of God which we have been
accustomed to from our childhood." According to this sense, Christ did
there teach them a prayer consisting wholly of petitions, and even
omitting the doxology which had been affixed; and the Amen, which was
usually said in the giving of thanks ([Co1
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#016).md), and in the Psalms, is added to
doxologies only. This disciple needed not to have urged John Baptist's
example: Christ was more ready to teach than ever John Baptist was, and
particularly taught to pray better than John did, or could, teach his
disciples.

III\. Christ gave them direction, much the same as he had given them
before in his sermon upon the mount, [Mat
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#009.md), etc. We cannot think that they
had forgotten it, but they ought to have had further and fuller
instructions, and he did not, as yet, think fit to give them any; when
the Spirit should be poured out upon them from on high, they would find
all their requests couched in these few words, and would be able, in
words of their own, to expatiate and enlarge upon them. In Matthew he
had directed them to pray after this manner; here, When ye pray, say;
which intimates that the Lord's prayer was intended to be used both as a
form of prayer and a directory.

1\. There are some differences between the Lord's prayer in Matthew and
Luke, by which it appears that it was not the design of Christ that we
should be tied up to these very words, for then there would have been no
variation. Here is one difference in the translation only, which ought
not to have been, when there is none in the original, and that is in the
third petition: As in heaven, so in earth; whereas the words are the
very same, and in the same order, as in Matthew. But there is a
difference in the fourth petition. In Matthew we pray, "Give us daily
bread this day:" here, "Give it us day by day" - kath' hēmeran. Day by
day; that is, "Give us each day the bread which our bodies require, as
they call for it:" not, "Give us this day bread for many days to come;"
but as the Israelites had manna, "Let us have bread today for today, and
tomorrow for tomorrow;" for thus we may be kept in a continual
dependence upon God, as children upon their parents, and may have our
mercies fresh from his hand daily, and may find ourselves under fresh
obligations to do the work of every day in the day, according as the
duty of the day requires, because we have from God the supplies of every
day in the day, according as the necessity of the day requires. Here is
likewise some difference in the fifth petition. In Matthew it is,
Forgive us our debts, as we forgive: here it is, Forgive us our sins;
which proves that our sins are our debts. For we forgive; not that our
forgiving those that have offended us can merit pardon from God, or be
an inducement to him to forgive us (he forgives for his own name's sake,
and his Son's sake); but this is a very necessary qualification for
forgiveness, and, if God have wrought it in us, we may plead that work
of his grace for the enforcing of our petitions for the pardon of our
sins: "Lord, forgive us, for thou hast thyself inclined us to forgive
others." There is another addition here; we plead not only in general,
We forgive our debtors, but in particular, "We profess to forgive every
one that is indebted to us, without exception. We so forgive our debtors
as not to bear malice or ill-will to any, but true love to all, without
any exception whatsoever." Here also the doxology in the close is wholly
omitted, and the Amen; for Christ would leave them at liberty to use
that or any other doxology fetched out of David's psalms; or, rather, he
left a vacuum here, to be filled up by a doxology more peculiar to the
Christian institutes, ascribing glory to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

2\. Yet it is, for substance, the same; and we shall therefore here only
gather up some general lessons from it.

(1.) That in prayer we ought to come to God as children to a Father, a
common Father to us and all mankind, but in a peculiar manner a Father
to all the disciples of Jesus Christ. Let us therefore in our requests
both for others and for ourselves, come to him with a humble boldness,
confiding in his power and goodness.

(2.) That at the same time, and in the same petitions, which we address
to God for ourselves, we should take in with us all the children of men,
as God's creatures and our fellow-creatures. A rooted principle of
catholic charity, and of Christian sanctified humanity, should go along
with us, and dictate to us throughout this prayer, which is so worded as
to be accommodated to that noble principle.

(3.) That in order to the confirming of the habit of heavenly-mindedness
in us, which ought to actuate and govern us in the whole course of our
conversation, we should, in all our devotions, with an eye of faith look
heavenward, and view the God we pray to as our Father in heaven, that we
may make the upper world more familiar to us, and may ourselves become
better prepared for the future state.

(4.) That in prayer, as well as in the tenour of our lives, we must seek
first the kingdom of God and the righteousness thereof, by ascribing
honour to his name, his holy name, and power to his government, both
that of his providence in the world and that of his grace in the church.
O that both the one and the other may be more manifested, and we and
others more manifestly brought into subjection to both!

(5.) That the principles and practices of the upper world, the unseen
world (which therefore by faith only we are apprized of), are the great
original - the archetupon, to which we should desire that the principles
and practices of this lower world, both in others and in ourselves, may
be more conformable. Those words, As in heaven, so on earth, refer to
all the first three petitions: "Father, let thy name be sanctified and
glorified, and thy kingdom prevail, and thy will be done on this earth
that is now alienated from thy service, as it is in yonder heaven that
is entirely devoted to thy service."

(6.) That those who faithfully and sincerely mind the kingdom of God,
and the righteousness thereof, may humbly hope that all other things, as
far as to Infinite Wisdom seems good, shall be added to them, and they
may in faith pray for them. If our first chief desire and care be that
God's name may be sanctified, his kingdom come, and his will be done, we
may then come boldly to the throne of grace for our daily bread, which
will then be sanctified to us when we are sanctified to God, and God is
sanctified by us.

(7.) That in our prayers for temporal blessings we must moderate our
desires, and confine them to a competency. The expression here used of
day by day is the very same with our daily bread; and therefore some
think that we must look for another signification of the word epiousios
than that of daily, which we give it, and that it means our necessary
bread, that bread that is suited to the craving of our nature, the fruit
that is brought out of the earth for our bodies that are made of the
earth and are earthly, [Psa 104:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#014.md).

(8.) That sins are debts which we are daily contracting, and which
therefore we should every day pray for the forgiveness of. We are not
only going behind with our rent every day by omissions of duty and in
duty, but are daily incurring the penalty of the law, as well as the
forfeiture of our bond, by our commissions. Every day adds to the score
of our guilt, and it is a miracle of mercy that we have so much
encouragement given us to come every day to the throne of grace, to pray
for the pardon of our sins of daily infirmity. God multiplies to pardon
beyond seventy times seven.

(9.) That we have no reason to expect, nor can with any confidence pray,
that God would forgive our sins against him, if we do not sincerely, and
from a truly Christian principle of charity, forgive those that have at
any time affronted us or been injurious to us. Though the words of our
mouth be even this prayer to God, if the meditation of our heart at the
same time be, as often it is, malice and revenge to our brethren, we are
not accepted, nor can we expect an answer of peace.

(10.) That temptations to sin should be as much dreaded and deprecated
by us as ruin by sin; and it should be as much our care and prayer to
get the power of sin broken in us as to get the guilt of sin removed
from us; and though temptation may be a charming, fawning, flattering
thing, we must be as earnest with God that we may not be led into it as
that we may not be led by that to sin, and by sin to ruin.

(11.) That God is to be depended upon, and sought unto, for our
deliverance from all evil; and we should pray, not only that we may not
be left to ourselves to run into evil, but that we may not be left to
Satan to bring evil upon us. Dr. Lightfoot understands it of being
delivered from the evil one, that is, the devil, and suggests that we
should pray particularly against the apparitions of the devil and his
possessions. The disciples were employed to cast out devils, and
therefore were concerned to pray that they might be guarded against the
particular spite he would always be sure to have against them.

IV\. He stirs up and encourages importunity, fervency, and constancy, in
prayer, by showing,

1\. That importunity will go far in our dealings with men, [Luk
11:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#005.md). Suppose a man, upon a sudden
emergency, goes to borrow a loaf or two of bread of a neighbour, at an
unseasonable time of night, not for himself, but for his friend that
came unexpectedly to him. His neighbour will be loth to accommodate him,
for he has wakened him with his knocking, and put him out of humour, and
he has a great deal to say in his excuse. The door is shut and locked,
his children are asleep in bed, in the same room with him, and, if he
make a noise, he shall disturb them. His servants are asleep, and he
cannot make them hear; and, for his own part, he shall catch cold if he
rise to give him. But his neighbour will have no nay, and therefore he
continues knocking still, and tells him he will do so till he has what
he comes for; so that he must give it to him, to be rid of him: He will
rise, and give him as many as he needs, because of his importunity. He
speaks this parable with the same intent that he speaks that in [Luk
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#001.md) : That men ought always to pray,
and not to faint. Not that God can be wrought upon by importunity; we
cannot be troublesome to him, nor by being so change his counsels. We
prevail with men by importunity because they are displeased with it, but
with God because he is pleased with it. Now this similitude may be of
use to us,

(1.) To direct us in prayer. \[1.\] We must come to God with boldness
and confidence for what we need, as a man does to the house of his
neighbour or friend, who, he knows, loves him, and is inclined to be
kind to him. \[2.\] We must come for bread, for that which is needful,
and which we cannot be without. \[3.\] We must come to him by prayer for
others as well as for ourselves. This man did not come for bread for
himself, but for his friend. The Lord accepted Job, when he prayed for
his friends, [Job 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#010.md). We cannot
come to God upon a more pleasing errand than when we come to him for
grace to enable us to do good, to feed many with our lips, to entertain
and edify those that come to us. \[4.\] We may come with the more
boldness to God in a strait, if it be a strait that we have not brought
ourselves into by our own folly and carelessness, but Providence has led
us into it. This man would not have wanted bread if his friend had not
come in unexpectedly. The care which Providence casts upon us, we may
with cheerfulness cast back upon Providence. \[5.\] We ought to continue
instant in prayer, and watch in the same with all perseverance.

(2.) To encourage us in prayer. If importunity could prevail thus with a
man who was angry at it, much more with a God who is infinitely more
kind and ready to do good to us than we are to one another, and is not
angry at our importunity, but accepts it, especially when it is for
spiritual mercies that we are importunate. If he do not answer our
prayers presently, yet he will in due time, if we continue to pray.

2\. That God has promised to give us what we ask of him. We have not
only the goodness of nature to take comfort fRom. but the word which he
has spoken ([Luk 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#009.md), [Luk
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#010).md): "Ask, and it shall be given
you; either the thing itself you shall ask or that which is equivalent;
either the thorn in the flesh removed, or grace sufficient given in." -
We had this before, [Mat 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007.md), [Mat
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#008.md). I say unto you. We have it from
Christ's own mouth, who knows his Father's mind, and in whom all
promises are yea and amen. We must not only ask, but we must seek, in
the use of means, must second our prayers with our endeavours; and, in
asking and seeking, we must continue pressing, still knocking at the
same door, and we shall at length prevail, not only by our prayers in
concert, but by our particular prayers: Every one that asketh receiveth,
even the meanest saint that asks in faith. This poor man cried, and the
Lord heard him, [Psa 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#006.md). When we ask
of God those things which Christ has here directed us to ask, that his
name may be sanctified, that his kingdom may come, and his will be done,
in these requests we must be importunate, must never hold our peace day
or night; we must not keep silence, nor give God any rest, until he
establish, until he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth, [Isa
62:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006.md), [Isa
62:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#007.md).

V. He gives us both instruction and encouragement in prayer from the
consideration of our relation to God as a Father. Here is,

1\. An appeal to the bowels of earthly fathers: "Let any of you that is
a father, and knows the heart of a father, a father's affection to a
child and care for a child, tell me, if his son ask bread for his
breakfast, will he give him a stone to breakfast on? If he ask a fish
for his dinner (when it may be a fish-day), will he for a fish give him
a serpent, that will poison and sting him? Or, if he shall ask an egg
for his supper (an egg and to bed), will he offer him a scorpion? You
know you could not be so unnatural to your own children," [Luk
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#011.md), [Luk
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#012.md).

2\. An application of this to the blessings of our heavenly Father ([Luk
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#013).md): If ye then, being evil, give,
and know how to give, good gifts to your children, much more shall God
give you the Spirit. He shall give good things; so it is in Matthew.
Observe,

(1.) The direction he gives us what to pray for. We must ask for the
Holy Spirit, not only a necessary in order to our praying well, but as
inclusive of all the good things we are to pray for; we need no more to
make us happy, for the Spirit is the worker of spiritual life, and the
earnest of eternal life. Note, The gift of the Holy Ghost is a gift we
are every one of us concerned earnestly and constantly to pray for.

(2.) The encouragement he gives us to hope that we shall speed in this
prayer: Your heavenly Father will give. It is in his power to give the
Spirit; he has all good things to bestow, wrapped up in that one; but
that is not all, it is in his promise, the gift of the Holy Ghost is in
the covenant, [Act 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#033.md), [Act
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038.md), and it is here inferred from
parents' readiness to supply their children's needs, and gratify their
desires, when they are natural and proper. If the child ask for a
serpent, or a scorpion, the father, in kindness, will deny him, but not
if he ask for what is needful, and will be nourishing. When God's
children ask for the Spirit, they do, in effect, ask for bread; for the
Spirit is the staff of life; nay, he is the Author of the soul's life.
If our earthly parents, though evil, be yet so kind, if they, though
weak, be yet so knowing, that they not only give, but give with
discretion, give what is best, in the best manner and time, much more
will our heavenly Father, who infinitely excels the fathers of our flesh
both in wisdom and goodness, give us his Holy Spirit. If earthly parents
be willing to lay out for the education of their children, to whom they
design to leave their estates, much more will our heavenly Father give
the spirit of sons to all those whom he has predestinated to the
inheritance of sons.

[Luke 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 11:14</span></span>

The substance of these verses we had in [Mat
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#022.md), etc. Christ is here giving a
general proof of his divine mission, by a particular proof of his power
over Satan, his conquest of whom was an indication of his great design
in coming into the world, which was, to destroy the works of the devil.
Here too he gives an earnest of the success of that undertaking. He is
here casting out a devil that made the poor possessed man dumb: in
Matthew we are told that he was blind and dumb. When the devil was
forced out by the word of Christ, the dumb spoke immediately, echoed to
Christ's word, and the lips were opened to show forth his praise. Now,

I. Some were affected with this miracle. The people wondered; they
admired the power of God, and especially that it should be exerted by
the hand of one who made so small a figure, that one who did the work of
the Messiah should have so little of that pomp of the Messiah which they
expected.

II\. Others were offended at it, and, to justify their infidelity,
suggested that it was by virtue of a league with Beelzebub, the prince
of the devils, that he did this, [Luk
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#015.md). It seems, in the devil's
kingdom there are chiefs, which supposes that there are subalterns. Now
they would have it thought, or said at least, that there was a
correspondence settled between Christ and the devil, that the devil
should have the advantage in the main and be victorious at last, but
that in order hereto, in particular instances, he should yield Christ
the advantage and retire by consent. Some, to corroborate this
suggestion, and confront the evidence of Christ's miraculous power,
challenged him to give them a sign from heaven ([Luk
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#016).md), to confirm his doctrine by
some appearance in the clouds, such as was upon mount Sinai when the law
was given; as if a sign from heaven, not disprovable by any sagacity of
theirs, could not have been given them as well by a compact and
collusion with the prince of the power of the air, who works with power
and lying wonders, as the casting out of a devil; nay, that would not
have been any present prejudice to his interest, which this manifestly
was. Note, Obstinate infidelity will never be at a loss for something to
say in its own excuse, though ever so frivolous and absurd. Now Christ
here returns a full and direct answer to this cavil of theirs; in which
he shows,

1\. That it can by no means be imagined that such a subtle prince as
Satan is should ever agree to measures that had such a direct tendency
to his own overthrow, and the undermining of his own kingdom, [Luk
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#017.md), [Luk
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#018.md). What they objected they kept to
themselves, afraid to speak it, lest it should be answered and baffled;
but Jesus knew their thoughts, even when they industriously thought to
conceal them, and he said, "You yourselves cannot but see the
groundlessness, and consequently the spitefulness, of this charge; for
it is an allowed maxim, confirmed by every day's experience, that no
interest can stand that is divided against itself; not the more public
interest of a kingdom, nor the private interest of a house or family; if
either the one or the other be divided against itself, it cannot stand.
Satan would herein act against himself; not only by the miracle which
turned him out of possession of the bodies of people, but much more in
the doctrine for the explication and confirmation of which the miracle
was wrought, which had a direct tendency to the ruin of Satan's interest
in the minds of men, by mortifying sin, and turning men to the service
of God. Now, if Satan should thus be divided against himself, he would
hasten his own overthrow, which you cannot suppose an enemy to do that
acts so subtlely for his own establishment, and is so solicitous to have
his kingdom stand."

2\. That was a very partial ill-natured thing for them to impute that in
him to a compact with Satan which yet they applauded and admired in
others that were of their own nation ([Luk
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#019).md): "By whom do your sons cast
them out? Some of your own kindred, as Jews, nay, and some of your own
followers, as Pharisees, have undertaken, in the name of the God of
Israel, to cast out devils, and they were never charged with such a
hellish combination as I am charged with." Note, It is gross hypocrisy
to condemn that in those who reprove us which yet we allow in those that
flatter us.

3\. That, in opposing the conviction of this miracle, they were enemies
to themselves, stood in their own light, and put a bar in their own
door, for they thrust from them the kingdom of God ([Luk
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#020).md): "If I with the finger of God
cast out devils, as you may assure yourselves I do, no doubt the kingdom
of God is come upon you, the kingdom of the Messiah offers itself and
all its advantages to you, and, if you receive it not, it is at your
peril." In Matthew it is by the Spirit of God, here by the finger of
God; the Spirit is the arm of the Lord, [Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md). His greatest and most mighty
works were wrought by his Spirit; but, if the Spirit in this work is
said to be the finger of the Lord, it perhaps may intimate how easily
Christ did and could conquer Satan, even with the finger of God, the
exerting of the divine power in a less and lower degree than in many
other instances. He needed not make bare his everlasting arm; that
roaring lion, when he pleases, is crushed, like a moth, with a touch of
a finger. Perhaps here is an allusion to the acknowledgment of Pharaoh's
magicians, when they were run aground ([Exo
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#019).md): This is the finger of God. "Now
if the kingdom of God be herein come to you, and you be found by those
cavils and blasphemies fighting against it, it will come upon you as a
victorious force which you cannot stand before."

4\. That his casting out devils was really the destroying of them and
their power, for it confirmed a doctrine which had a direct tendency to
the ruining of his kingdom, [Luk
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#021.md), [Luk
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#022.md). Perhaps there had been some who
had cast out the inferior devils by compact with Beelzebub their chief,
but that was without any real damage or prejudice to Satan and his
kingdom, what he lost one way he gained another. The devil and such
exorcists played booty, as we say, and, while the forlorn hope of his
army gave ground, the main body thereby gained ground; the interest of
Satan in the souls of men was not weakened by it in the least. But, when
Christ cast out devils, he needed not do it by any compact with them,
for he was stronger than they, and could do it by force, and did it so
as to ruin Satan's power and blast his great design by that doctrine and
that grace which break the power of sin, and so rout Satan's main body,
take from him all his armour, and divide his spoils, which no one devil
ever did to another or ever will. Now this is applicable to Christ's
victories over Satan both in the world and in the hearts of particular
persons, by that power which went along with the preaching of his
gospel, and does still. And so we may observe here,

(1.) The miserable condition of an unconverted sinner. In his heart,
which was fitted to be a habitation of God, the devil has his palace;
and all the powers and the faculties of the soul, being employed by him
in the service of sin, are his goods. Note, \[1.\] The heart of every
unconverted sinner is the devil's palace, where he resides and where he
rules; he works in the children of disobedience. The heart is a palace,
a noble dwelling; but the unsanctified heart is the devil's palace. His
will is obeyed, his interests are served, and the militia is in his
hands; he usurps the throne in the soul. \[2.\] The devil, as a strong
man armed, keeps this palace, does all he can to secure it to himself,
and to fortify it against Christ. All the prejudices with which he
hardens men's hearts against truth and holiness are the strong-holds
which he erects for the keeping of his palace; this palace is his
garrison. \[3.\] There is a kind of peace in the palace of an
unconverted soul, while the devil, as a strong man armed, keeps it. The
sinner has a good opinion of himself, is very secure and merry, has no
doubt concerning the goodness of his state nor any dread of the judgment
to come; he flatters himself in his own eyes, and cries peace to
himself. Before Christ appeared, all was quiet, because all went one
way; but the preaching of the gospel disturbed the peace of the devil's
palace.

(2.) The wonderful change that is made in conversion, which is Christ's
victory over this usurper. Satan is a strong man armed; but our Lord
Jesus is stronger than he, as God, as Mediator. If we speak of strength,
he is strong: more are with us than against us. Observe, \[1.\] The
manner of this victory: He comes upon him by surprise, when his goods
are in peace and the devil thinks it is all his own for ever, and
overcomes him. Note, The conversion of a soul to God is Christ's victory
over the devil and his power in that soul, restoring the soul to its
liberty, and recovering his own interest in it and dominion over it.
\[2.\] The evidences of this victory. First, He takes from him all his
armour wherein he trusted. The devil is a confident adversary; he trusts
to his armour, as Pharaoh to his rivers ([Eze
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003).md): but Christ disarms him. When
the power of sin and corruption in the soul is broken, when the mistakes
are rectified, the eyes opened, the heart humbled and changed, and made
serious and spiritual, then Satan's armour is taken away. Secondly, He
divides the spoils; he takes possession of them for himself. All the
endowments of mind and body, the estate, power, interest, which before
were made use of in the service of sin and Satan, are now converted to
Christ's service and employed for him; yet this is not all; he makes a
distribution of them among his followers, and, and having conquered
Satan, gives to all believers the benefit of that victory. Hence Christ
infers that, since the whole drift of his doctrine and miracles was to
break the power of the devil, that great enemy of mankind, it was the
duty of all to join with him and to follow his guidance, to receive his
gospel and come heartily into the interests of it; for otherwise they
would justly be reckoned as siding with the enemy ([Luk
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#023).md): He that is not with me is
against me. Those therefore who rejected the doctrine of Christ, and
slighted his miracles, were looked upon as adversaries to him, and in
the devil's interest.

5\. That there was a vast difference between the devil's going out by
compact and his being cast out by compulsion. Those out of whom Christ
cast him he never entered into again, for so was Christ's charge ([Mar
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#025).md); whereas, if he had gone out,
whenever he saw fit he would have made a re-entry, for that is the way
of the unclean spirit, when he voluntarily and with design goes out of a
man, [Luk 11:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#024.md). The prince of the
devils may give leave, nay, may give order, to his forces to retreat, or
make a feint, to draw the poor deluded soul into an ambush; but Christ,
as he gives a total, so he gives a final, defeat to the enemy. In this
part of the argument he has a further intention, which is to represent
the state of those who have had fair offers made them, - among whom, and
in whom, God has begun to break the devil's power and overthrow his
kingdom, - but they reject his counsel against themselves, and relapse
into a state of subjection to Satan. Here we have,

(1.) The condition of a formal hypocrite, his bright side and his dark
side. His heart still remains the devil's house; he calls it his own,
and he retains his interest in it; and yet, \[1.\] The unclean spirit is
gone out. He was not driven out by the power of converting grace; there
was none of that violence which the kingdom of heaven suffers; but he
went out, withdrew for a time, so that the man seemed not to be under
the power of Satan as formerly, nor so followed with his temptations.
Satan is gone, or has turned himself into an angel of light. \[2.\] The
house is swept from common pollutions, by a forced confession of sin, as
Pharaoh's - a feigned contrition for it, as Ahab's, - and a partial
reformation, as Herod's. There are those that have escaped the
pollutions of the world, and yet are still under the power of the god of
this world, [Pe2 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#020.md). The house is
swept, but it is not washed; and Christ hath said, If I wash thee not,
thou hast no part with me; the house must be washed, or it is none of
his. Sweeping takes off only the loose dirt, while the sin that besets
the sinner, the beloved sin, is untouched. It is swept from the filth
that lies open to the eye of the world, but it is not searched and
ransacked for secret filthiness, [Mat
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#025.md). It is swept, but the leprosy is
in the wall, and will be till something more be done. \[3.\] The house
is garnished with common gifts and graces. It is not furnished with any
true grace, but garnished with the pictures of all graces. Simon Magus
was garnished with faith, Balaam with good desires, Herod with a respect
for John, the Pharisees with many external performances. It is
garnished, but it is like a potsherd covered with silver dross, it is
all paint and varnish, not real, not lasting. The house is garnished,
but the property is not altered; it was never surrendered to Christ, nor
inhabited by the Spirit. Let us therefore take heed of resting in that
which a man may have and yet come short.

(2.) Here is the condition of a final apostate, into whom the devil
returns after he had gone out: Then goes he, and takes seven other
spirits more wicked than himself ([Luk
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#026).md); a certain number for an
uncertain, as seven devils are said to be cast out of Mary Magdalene.
Seven wicked spirits are opposed to the seven spirits of God, [Rev
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001.md). These are said to be more wicked
than himself. It seems, even devils are not all alike wicked; probably,
the degrees of their wickedness, now that they are fallen, are as the
degrees of their holiness were while they stood. When the devil would do
mischief most effectually, he employs those that are more mischievous
than himself. These enter in without any difficulty or opposition; they
are welcomed, and they dwell there; there they work, there they rule;
and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Note, \[1.\]
Hypocrisy is the high road to apostasy. If the heart remains in the
interest of sin and Satan, the shows and shadows will come to nothing;
those that have not set that right will not long be stedfast. Where
secret haunts of sin are kept up, under the cloak of a visible
profession, conscience is debauched, God is provoked to withdraw his
restraining grace, and the close hypocrite commonly proves an open
apostate, \[2.\] The last state of such is worse than the first, in
respect both of sin and punishment. Apostates are usually the worst of
men, the most vain and profligate, the most bold and daring; their
consciences are seared, and their sins of all others the most
aggravated. God often sets marks of his displeasure upon them in this
world, and in the other world they will receive the greater damnation.
Let us therefore hear, and fear, and hold fast our integrity.

[Luke 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 11:27</span></span>

We had not this passage in the other evangelists, nor can we tack it, as
Dr. Hammond does, to that of Christ's mother and brethren desiring to
speak with him (for this evangelist also has related that in [Luk
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#019).md), but it contains an interruption
much like that, and, like that, occasion is taken from it for
instruction.

1\. The applause which an affectionate, honest, well-meaning woman gave
to our Lord Jesus, upon hearing his excellent discourses. While the
scribes and Pharisees despised and blasphemed them, this good woman (and
probably she was a person of some quality) admired them, and the wisdom
and power with which he spoke: As he spoke these things ([Luk
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#027).md), with a convincing force and
evidence, a certain woman of the company was so pleased to hear how he
had confounded the Pharisees, and conquered them, and put them to shame,
and cleared himself from their vile insinuations, that she could not
forbear crying out, "Blessed is the womb that bore thee. What an
admirable, what an excellent man is this! Surely never was there a
greater or better born of a woman: happy the woman that has him for her
son. I should have thought myself very happy to have been the mother of
one that speaks as never man spoke, that has so much of the grace of
heaven in him, and is so great a blessing to this earth." This was well
said, as it expressed her high esteem of Christ, and that for the sake
of his doctrine; and it was not amiss that it reflected honour upon the
virgin Mary his mother, for it agreed with what she herself had said
([Luk 1:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#048).md), All generations shall
call me blessed; some even of this generation, bad as it was. Note, To
all that believe the word of Christ the person of Christ is precious,
and he is an honour, [Pe1 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007.md). Yet we
must be careful, lest, as this good woman, we too much magnify the
honour of his natural kindred, and so know him after the flesh, whereas
we must now henceforth know him so no more.

2\. The occasion which Christ took from this to pronounce them more
happy who are his faithful and obedient followers than she was who bore
and nursed him. He does not deny what this woman said, nor refuse her
respect to him and his mother; but leads her from this to that which was
of higher consideration, and which more concerned her: Yea, rather,
blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it, [Luk
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#028.md). He thinks them so; and his
saying that they are so makes them so, and should make us of his mind.
This is intended partly as a check to her, for doting so much upon his
bodily presence and his human nature, partly as an encouragement to her
to hope that she might be as happy as his own mother, whose happiness
she was ready to envy, if she would hear the word of God and keep it.
Note, Though it is a great privilege to hear the word of God, yet those
only are truly blessed, that is, blessed of the Lord, that hear it and
keep it, that keep it in memory, and keep to it as their way and rule.

[Luke 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 11:29</span></span>

Christ's discourse in these verses shows two things: -

I. What is the sign we may expect from God for the confirmation of our
faith. The great and most convincing proof of Christ's being sent of
God, and which they were yet to wait for, after the many signs that had
been given them, was the resurrection of Christ from the dead. Here is,

1\. A reproof to the people for demanding other signs than what had
already been given them in great plenty: The people were gathered
thickly together ([Luk 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#029).md), a vast
crowd of them, expecting not so much to have their consciences informed
by the doctrine of Christ as to have their curiosity gratified by his
miracles. Christ knew what brought such a multitude together; they came
seeking a sign, they came to gaze, to have something to talk of when
they went home; and it is an evil generation which nothing will awaken
and convince, no, not the most sensible demonstrations of divine power
and goodness.

2\. A promise that yet there should be one sign more given them,
different from any that had yet been given them, even the sign of Jonas
the prophet, which in Matthew is explained as meaning the resurrection
of Christ. As Jonas being cast into the sea, and lying there three days,
and then coming up alive and preaching repentance to the Ninevites, was
a sign to them, upon which they turned from their evil way, so shall the
death and resurrection of Christ, and the preaching of his gospel
immediately after to the Gentile world, be the last warning to the
Jewish nation. If they be provoked to a holy jealousy by this, well and
good; but, if this do not work upon them, let them look for nothing but
utter ruin: The Son of Man shall be a sign to this generation ([Luk
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#030).md), a sign speaking to them,
though a sign spoken against by them.

3\. A warning to them to improve this sign; for it was at their peril if
they did not. (1.) The queen of Sheba would rise up in judgment against
them, and condemn their unbelief, [Luk
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#031.md). She was a stranger to the
commonwealth of Israel, and yet so readily gave credit to the report she
heard of the glories of a king of Israel, that, notwithstanding the
prejudices we are apt to conceive against foreigners, she came from the
uttermost parts of the earth to hear his wisdom, not only to satisfy her
curiosity, but to inform her mind, especially in the knowledge of the
true God and his worship, which is upon record, to her honour; and,
behold, a greater than Solomon in here, pleion Solomōntos - more than a
Solomon is here; that is, says Dr. Hammond, more of wisdom and more
heavenly divine doctrine than ever was in all Solomon's words or
writings; and yet these wretched Jews will give no manner of regard to
what Christ says to them, though he be in the midst of them. (2.) The
Ninevites would rise up in judgment against them, and condemn their
impenitency ([Luk 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#032).md): They
repented at the preaching of Jonas; but here is preaching which far
exceeds that of Jonas, is more powerful and awakening, and threatens a
much sorer ruin than that of Nineveh, and yet none are startled by it,
to turn from their evil way, as the Ninevites did.

II\. What is the sign that God expects from us for the evidencing of our
faith, and that is the serious practice of that religion which we
profess to believe, and a readiness to entertain all divine truths, when
brought to us in their proper evidence. Now observe,

1\. They had the light with all the advantage they could desire. For
God, having lighted the candle of the gospel, did not put it in a secret
place, or under a bushel; Christ did not preach in corners. The apostles
were ordered to preach the gospel to every creature; and both Christ and
his ministers, Wisdom and her maidens, cry in the chief places of
concourse, [Luk 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#033.md). It is a great
privilege that the light of the gospel is put on a candlestick, so that
all that come in may see it, and may see by it where they are and
whither they are going, and what is the true, and sure, and only way to
happiness.

2\. Having the light, their concern was to have the sight, or else to
what purpose had they the light? Be the object ever so clear, if the
organ be not right, we are never the better: The light of the body is
the eye ([Luk 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#034).md), which receives
the light of the candle when it is brought into the room. So the light
of the soul is the understanding and judgment, and its power of
discerning between good and evil, truth and falsehood. Now, according as
this is, so the light of divine revelation is to us, and our benefit by
it; it is a savour of life unto life, or of death unto death. (1.) If
this eye of the soul be single, if it see clear, see things as they are,
and judge impartially concerning them, if it aim at truth only, and seek
it for its own sake, and have not any sinister by - looks and
intentions, the whole body, that is, the whole soul, is full of light,
it receives and entertains the gospel, which will bring along with it
into the soul both knowledge and joy. This denotes the same thing with
that of the good ground, receiving the word and understanding it. If our
understanding admits the gospel in its full light, it fills the soul,
and it has enough to fill it. And if the soul be thus filled with the
light of the gospel, having no part dark, - if all its powers and
faculties be subjected to the government and influence of the gospel,
and none left unsanctified, - then the whole soul shall be full of
light, full of holiness and comfort. It was darkness itself, but now
light in the Lord, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee
light, [Luk 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#036.md). Note, The gospel
will come into those souls whose doors and windows are thrown open to
receive it; and where it comes it will bring light with it. But, (2.) If
the eye of the soul be evil, - if the judgment be bribed and biassed by
the corrupt and vicious dispositions of the mind, by pride and envy, by
the love of the world and sensual pleasures, - if the understanding be
prejudiced against divine truths, and resolved not to admit them, though
brought with ever so convincing an evidence, - it is no wonder that the
whole body, the whole soul, should be full of darkness, [Luk
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#034.md). How can they have instruction,
information, direction, or comfort, from the gospel, that wilfully shut
their eyes against it? and what hope is there of such? what remedy for
them? The inference hence therefore is, Take heed that the light which
is in thee be not darkness, [Luk
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#035.md). Take heed that the eye of the
mind be not blinded by partiality, and prejudice, and sinful aims. Be
sincere in your enquiries after truth, and ready to receive it in the
light, and love, and power of it; and not as the men of this generation
to whom Christ preached, who never sincerely desired to know God's will,
nor designed to do it, and therefore no wonder that they walked on in
darkness, wandered endlessly, and perished eternally.

[Luke 11:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 11:37</span></span>

Christ here says many of those things to a Pharisee and his guests, in a
private conversation at table, which he afterwards said in a public
discourse in the temple (Mt. 23); for what he said in public and private
was of a piece. He would not say that in a corner which he durst not
repeat and stand to in the great congregation; nor would he give those
reproofs to any sort of sinners in general which he durst not apply to
them in particular as he met with them; for he was, and is, the faithful
Witness. Here is,

I. Christ's going to dine with a Pharisee that very civilly invited him
to his house ([Luk 11:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#037).md); As he
spoke, even while he was speaking, a certain Pharisee interrupted him
with a request to him to come and dine with him, to come forthwith, for
it was dinner-time. We are willing to hope that the Pharisee was so well
pleased with his discourse that he was willing to show him respect, and
desirous to have more of his company, and therefore gave him this
invitation and bade him truly welcome; and yet we have some cause to
suspect that it was with an ill design, to break off his discourse to
the people, and to have an opportunity of ensnaring him and getting
something out of him which might serve for matter of accusation or
reproach, [Luk 11:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#053.md), [Luk
11:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#054.md). We know not the mind of this
Pharisee; but, whatever it was, Christ knew it: if he meant ill, he
shall know Christ does not fear him; if well, he shall know Christ is
willing to do him good: so he went in, and sat down to meat. Note,
Christ's disciples must learn of him to be conversable, and not morose.
Though we have need to be cautious what company we keep, yet we need not
be rigid, nor must we therefore go out of the world.

II\. The offence which the Pharisee took at Christ, as those of that
sort had sometimes done at the disciples of Christ, for not washing
before dinner, [Luk 11:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#038.md). He wondered
that a man of his sanctity, a prophet, a man of so much devotion, and
such a strict conversation, should sit down to meat, and not first wash
his hands, especially being newly come out of a mixed company, and there
being in the Pharisee's dining-room, no doubt, all accommodations set
ready for it, so that he need not fear being troublesome; and the
Pharisee himself and all his guests, no doubt, washing, so that he could
not be singular; what, and yet not wash? What harm had it been if he had
washed? Was it not strictly commanded by the canons of their church? It
was so, and therefore Christ would not do it, because he would witness
against their assuming a power to impose that as a matter of religion
which God commanded them not. The ceremonial law consisted in divers
washings, but this was none of them, and therefore Christ would not
practise it, no not in complaisance to the Pharisee who invited him, nor
though he knew that offence would be taken at his omitting it.

III\. The sharp reproof which Christ, upon this occasion, gave to the
Pharisees, without begging pardon even of the Pharisee whose guest he
now was; for we must not flatter our best friends in any evil thing.

1\. He reproves them for placing religion so much in those instances of
it which are only external, and fall under the eye of man, while those
were not only postponed, but quite expunged, which respect the soul, and
fall under the eye of God, [Luk 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#039.md),
[Luk 11:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#040). Now observe here, (1..md) The
absurdity they were guilty of: "You Pharisees make clean the outside
only, you wash your hands with water, but do not wash your hearts from
wickedness; these are full of covetousness and malice, covetousness of
men's goods, and malice against good men." Those can never be reckoned
cleanly servants that wash only the outside of the cup out of which
their master drinks, or the platter out of which he eats, and take no
care to make clean the inside, the filth of which immediately affects
the meat or drink. The frame or temper of the mind in every religious
service is as the inside of the cup and platter; the impurity of this
infects the services, and therefore to keep ourselves free from
scandalous enormities, and yet to live under the dominion of spiritual
wickedness, is as great an affront to God as it would be for a servant
to give the cup into his master's hand, clean wiped from all the dust on
the outside, but within full of cobwebs and spiders. Ravening and
wickedness, that is, reigning worldliness and reigning spitefulness,
which men think they can find some cloak and cover for, are the
dangerous damning sins of many who have made the outside of the cup
clean from the more gross, and scandalous, and inexcusable sins of
whoredom and drunkenness. (2.) A particular instance of the absurdity of
it: "Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that
which is within also? [Luk 11:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#040.md). Did
not that God who in the law of Moses appointed divers ceremonial
washings, with which you justify yourselves in these practices and
impositions, appoint also that you should cleanse and purify your
hearts? He who made laws for that which is without, did not he even in
those laws further intend something within, and by other laws show how
little he regarded the purifying of the flesh, and the putting away of
the filth of that, if the heart be not made clean?" Or, it may have
regard to God not only as a Lawgiver, but (which the words seem rather
to import) as a Creator. Did not God, who made us these bodies (and they
are fearfully and wonderfully made), make us these souls also, which are
more fearfully and wonderfully made? Now, if he made both, he justly
expects we should take care of both; and therefore not only wash the
body, which he is the former of, and make the hands clean in honour of
his work, but wash the spirit, which he is the Father of, and get the
leprosy in the heart cleansed.

To this he subjoins a rule for making our creature-comforts clean to us
([Luk 11:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#041).md): "Instead of washing your
hands before you go to meat, give alms of such things as you have" (ta
enonta - of such things as are set before you, and present with you);
"let the poor have their share out of them, and then all things are
clean to you, and you may use them comfortably." Here is a plain
allusion to the law of Moses, by which it was provided that certain
portions of the increase of their land should be given to the Levite,
the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow; and, when that was done,
what was reserved for their own use was clean to them, and they could in
faith pray for a blessing upon it, [Deu
26:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012.md). Then we can with comfort
enjoy the gifts of God's bounty ourselves when we send portions to them
for whom nothing is prepared, [Neh
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#010.md). Job ate not his morsel alone,
but the fatherless ate thereof, and so it was clean to him ([Job
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#017).md); clean, that is, permitted and
allowed to be used, and then only can it be used comfortably. Note, What
we have is not our own, unless God have his dues out of it; and it is by
liberality to the poor that we clear up to ourselves our liberty to make
use of our creature-comforts.

2\. He reproves them for laying stress upon trifles, and neglecting the
weighty matters of the law, [Luk
11:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#042). (1..md) Those laws which related
only to the means of religion they were very exact in the observance of,
as particularly those concerning the maintenance of the priests: Ye pay
tithe of mint and rue, pay it in kind and to the full, and will not put
off the priests with a modus decimandi or compound for it. By this they
would gain reputation with the people as strict observers of the law,
and would make an interest in the priests, in whose power it was many a
time to do them a kindness; and no wonder if the priests and the
Pharisees contrived how to strengthen one another's hands. Now Christ
does not condemn them for being so exact in paying tithes (these things
ought ye to have done), but to think that this would atone for the
neglect of their greater duties; for, (2.) Those laws which relate to
the essentials of religion they made nothing of: You pass over judgment
and the love of God, you make no conscience of giving men their dues and
God your hearts.

3\. He reproves them for their pride and vanity, and affectations of
precedency and praise of men ([Luk
11:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#043).md): "Ye love the uppermost seats
in the synagogues" (or consistories where the elders met for
government); "if you have not those seats, you are ambitious of them; if
you have, you are proud of them; and you love greetings in the markets,
to be complimented by the people and to have their cap and knee." It is
not sitting uppermost, or being greeted, that is reproved, but loving
it.

4\. He reproves them for their hypocrisy, and their colouring over the
wickedness of their hearts and lives with specious pretences ([Luk
11:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#044).md): "You are as graves overgrown
with grass, which therefore appear not, and the men that walk over them
are not aware of them, and so they contract the ceremonial pollution
which by the law arose from the touch of a grave." These Pharisees were
within full of abominations, as a grave of putrefaction; full of
covetousness, envy, and malice; and yet they concealed it so artfully
with a profession of devotion, that it did not appear, so that they who
conversed with them, and followed their doctrine, were defiled with sin,
infected with their corruptions and ill morals, and yet, they making a
show of piety, suspected no danger by them. The contagion insinuated
itself, and was insensibly caught, and those that caught it thought
themselves never the worse.

IV\. The testimony which he bore also against the lawyers or scribes,
who made it their business to expound the law according to the tradition
of the elders, as the Pharisees did to observe the law according to that
tradition.

1\. There was one of that profession who resented what he said against
the Pharisees ([Luk 11:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#045).md): "Master,
thus saying thou reproachest us also, for we are scribes; and we are
therefore hypocrites?" Note, It is a common thing for unhumbled sinners
to call and count reproofs reproaches. It is the wisdom of those who
desire to have their sin mortified to make a good use of reproaches that
come from ill will, and to turn them into reproofs. If we can in this
way hear of our faults, and amend them, it is well: but it is the folly
of those who are wedded to their sins, and resolved not to part with
them, to make an ill use of the faithful and friendly admonitions given
them, which come from love, and to have their passions provoked by them
as if they were intended for reproaches, and therefore fly in the face
of their reprovers, and justify themselves in rejecting the reproof.
Thus the prophet complained ([Jer
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#010).md): The word of the Lord is to them
a reproach; they have no delight in it. This lawyer espoused the
Pharisee's cause, and so made himself partaker of his sins.

2\. Our Lord Jesus thereupon took them to task ([Luk
11:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#046).md): Woe unto you also, ye lawyers;
and again ([Luk 11:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#052).md): Woe unto you
lawyers. They blessed themselves in the reputation they had among the
people, who thought them happy men, because they studied the law, and
were always conversant with that, and had the honour of instructing the
people in the knowledge of that; but Christ denounced woes against them,
for he sees not as man sees. This was just upon him for taking the
Pharisee's part, and quarrelling with Christ because he reproved them.
Note, Those who quarrel with the reproofs of others, and suspect them to
be reproaches to them, do but get woes of their own by so doing.

(1.) The lawyers are reproved for making the services of religion more
burdensome to others, but more easy to themselves, than God had made
them ([Luk 11:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#046).md): "You lade men with
burdens grievous to be borne, by your traditions, which bind them out
from many liberties God has allowed them, and bind them up to many
slaveries which God never enjoined them, to show your authority, and to
keep people in awe; but you yourselves touch them not with one of your
fingers;" that is, \[1.\] "You will not burden yourselves with them, nor
be yourselves bound by those restraints with which you hamper others."
They would seem, by the hedges they pretended to make about the law, to
be very strict for the observance of the law; but, if you could see
their practices, you would find that they not only make nothing of those
hedges themselves, but make nothing of the law itself neither: thus the
confessors of the Romish church are said to do with their penitents.
\[2.\] "You will not lighten them to those you have power over; you will
not touch them, that is, either to repeal them or to dispense with them
when you find them to be burdensome and grievous to the people." They
would come in with both hands to dispense with a command of God, but not
with a finger to mitigate the rigour of any of the traditions of the
elders.

(2.) They are reproved for pretending a veneration for the memory of the
prophets whom their fathers killed, when yet they hated and persecuted
those in their own day who were sent to them on the same errand, to call
them to repentance, and direct them to Christ, [Luk
11:47-49](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#047.md). \[1.\] These hypocrites,
among other pretences of piety, built the sepulchres of the prophets;
that is, they erected monuments over their graves, in honour of them,
probably with large inscriptions containing high encomiums of them. They
were not so superstitious as to enshrine their relics, or to think their
devotions the more acceptable to God for being offered at the tombs of
the martyrs; they did not burn incense or pray to them, or plead their
merits with God; they did not add that iniquity to their hypocrisy; but,
as if they owned themselves the children of the prophets, their heirs
and executors, they repaired and beautified the monuments sacred to
their pious memory. \[2.\] Notwithstanding this, they had an inveterate
enmity to those in their own day that came to them in the spirit and
power of those prophets; and, though they had not yet had an opportunity
of carrying it far, yet they would soon do it, for the Wisdom of God
said, that is, Christ himself would so order it, and did now foretel it,
that they would slay and persecute the prophets and apostles that should
be sent them. The Wisdom of God would thus make trial of them, and
discover their odious hypocrisy, by sending them prophets, to reprove
them for their sins and warn them of the judgments of God. Those
prophets should prove themselves apostles, or messengers sent from
heaven, by signs, and wonders, and gifts of the Holy Ghost. Or, "I will
send them prophets under the style and title of apostles, who yet shall
produce as good an authority as any of the old prophets did; and these
they shall not only contradict and oppose, but slay and persecute, and
put to death." Christ foresaw this, and yet did not otherwise than as
became the Wisdom of God in sending them, for he knew how to bring glory
to himself in the issue, by the recompences reserved both for the
persecutors and the persecuted in the future state. \[3.\] That
therefore God will justly put another construction upon their building
the tombs of the prophets than what they would be thought to intend, and
it shall be interpreted their allowing the deeds of their fathers ([Luk
11:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#045).md); for, since by their present
actions it appeared that they had no true value for their prophets, the
building of their sepulchres shall have this sense put upon it, that
they resolved to keep them in their graves whom their fathers had
hurried thither. Josiah, who had a real value for prophets, thought it
enough not to disturb the grave of the man of God at Bethel: Let no man
move his bones, [Kg2 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#017.md), [Kg2
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#018.md). If these lawyers will carry the
matter further, and will build their sepulchres, it is such a piece of
over-doing as gives cause to suspect an ill design in it, and that it is
meant as a cover for some design against prophecy itself, like the kiss
of a traitor, as he that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising
early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him, [Pro
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#014.md).

\[4.\] That they must expect no other than to be reckoned with, as the
fillers up of the measure of persecution, [Luk
11:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#050.md), [Luk
11:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#051.md). They keep up the trade as it
were in succession, and therefore are responsible for the debts of the
company, even those it has been contracting all along from the blood of
Abel, when the world began, to that of Zacharias, and so forward to the
end of the Jewish state; it shall all be required of this generation,
this last generation of the Jews, whose sin in persecuting Christ's
apostles would exceed any of the sins of that kind that their fathers
were guilty of, and so would bring wrath upon them to the uttermost,
[Th1 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#015.md), [Th1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016.md). Their destruction by the Romans
was so terrible that it might well be reckoned the completing of God's
vengeance upon that persecuting nation.

(3.) They are reproved for opposing the gospel of Christ, and doing all
they could to obstruct the progress and success of it, [Luk
11:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#052.md). \[1.\] They had not, according
to the duty of their place, faithfully expounded to the people those
scriptures of the Old Testament which pointed at the Messiah, which if
they had been led into the right understanding of by the lawyers, they
would readily have embraced him and his doctrine: but, instead of that,
they had perverted those texts, and had cast a mist before the eyes of
the people, by their corrupt glosses upon them, and this is called
taking away the key of knowledge; instead of using that key for the
people, and helping them to use it aright, they hid it from them; this
is called, in Matthew, shutting up the kingdom of heaven against men,
[Mat 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#013.md). Note, those who take away
the key of knowledge shut up the kingdom of heaven. \[2.\] They
themselves did not embrace the gospel of Christ, though by their
acquaintance with the Old Testament they could not but know that the
time was fulfilled, and the kingdom of God was at hand; they saw the
prophecies accomplished in that kingdom which our Lord Jesus was about
to set up, and yet would not themselves enter into it. Nay, \[3.\] Them
that without any guidance or assistance of theirs were entering in they
did all they could to hinder and discourage, by threatening to cast them
out of the synagogue, and otherwise terrifying them. It is bad for
people to be averse to revelation, but much worse to be adverse to it.

Lastly, In the close of the chapter we are told how spitefully and
maliciously the scribes and Pharisees contrived to draw him into a
snare, [Luk 11:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#053.md), [Luk
11:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#054.md). They could not bear those
cutting reproofs which they must own to be just; but what he had said
against them in particular would not bear an action, nor could they
ground upon it any criminal accusation, and therefore, as if, because
his reproofs were warm, they hoped to stir him up to some intemperate
heat and passion, so as to put him off his guard, they began to urge him
vehemently, to be very fierce upon him, and to provoke him to speak of
many things, to propose dangerous questions to him, laying wait for
something which might serve the design they had of making him either
odious to the people, or obnoxious to the government, or both. Thus did
they seek occasion against him, like David's enemies that did every day
wrest his words, [Psa 56:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#005.md). Evil men
dig up mischief. Note, Faithful reprovers of sin must expect to have
many enemies, and have need to set a watch before the door of their
lips, because of their observers that watch for their halting. The
prophet complains of those in his time who make a man an offender for a
word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, [Isa
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#021.md). That we may bear trials of this
kind with patience, and get through them with prudence, let us consider
him who endured such contradiction of sinners against himself.
