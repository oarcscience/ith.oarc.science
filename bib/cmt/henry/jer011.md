### [Jeremiah Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 11:0</span></span>

In this chapter, I. God by the prophet puts the people in mind of the
covenant he had made with their fathers, and how much he had insisted
upon it, as the condition of the covenant, that they should be obedient
to him ([Jer 11:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#001).md). II. He charges
it upon them that they, in succession to their fathers, and in
confederacy among themselves, had obstinately refused to obey him ([Jer
11:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#008).md). III. He threatens to punish
them with utter ruin for their disobedience, especially for their
idolatry ([Jer 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#011.md), [Jer
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#013).md), and tells them that their
idols should not save them ([Jer
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#012).md), that their prophets should not
pray for them ([Jer 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#014).md); he also
justifies his proceedings herein, they having brought all this mischief
upon themselves by their own folly and wilfulness ([Jer
11:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#015).md). IV. Here is an account of a
conspiracy formed against Jeremiah by his fellow-citizens, the men of
Anathoth; God's discovery of it to him ([Jer
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#018.md), [Jer
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#019).md), his prayer against them ([Jer
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#020).md), and a prediction of God's
judgments upon them for it ([Jer
11:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#021).md).

[Jeremiah 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 11:1</span></span>

The prophet here, as prosecutor in God's name, draws up an indictment
against the Jews for wilful disobedience to the commands of their
rightful Sovereign. For the more solemn management of this charge,

I. He produces the commission he had to draw up the charge against them.
He did not take pleasure in accusing the children of his people, but God
commanded him to speak it to the men of Judah, [Jer
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#001.md), [Jer
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#002.md). In the original it is plural:
Speak you this. For what he said to Jeremiah was the same that he gave
in charge to all his servants the prophets. They none of them said any
other than what Moses, in the law, had said; to that therefore they must
refer themselves, and direct the people: "Hear the words of this
covenant; turn to your Bibles, be judged by them." Jeremiah must now
proclaim this in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, that
all may hear, for all are concerned. All the words of reproof and
conviction which the prophets spoke were grounded upon the words of the
covenant, and agreed with that; and therefore "hear these words, and
understand by them upon what terms you stood with God at first; and
then, by comparing yourselves with the covenant, you will soon be aware
upon what terms you now stand with him."

II\. He opens the charter upon which their state was founded and by
which they held their privileges. They had forgotten the tenour of it,
and lived as if they thought that the grant was absolute and that they
might do what they pleased and yet have what God had promised, or as if
they thought that the keeping up of the ceremonial observances was all
that God required of them. He therefore shows them, with all possible
plainness, that the thing God insisted upon was obedience, which was
better than sacrifice. He said, Obey my voice, [Jer
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#004.md) and again [Jer
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#007.md). "Own God for your Master; give
up yourselves to him as his subjects and servants; attend to all the
declarations of his mind and will, and make conscience of complying with
them. Do my commandments, not only in some things, but according to all
which I command you; make conscience of moral duties especially, and
rest not in those that are merely ritual; hear the words of the
covenant, and do them." 1. This was the original contract between God
and them, when he first formed them into a people. It was what he
commanded their fathers when he first brought them forth out of the land
of Egypt, [Jer 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#004.md) and [Jer
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#007.md). He never intended to take them
under his guidance and protection upon any other terms. This was what he
required from them in gratitude for the great things he did for them
when he brought them from the iron furnace. He redeemed them out of the
service of the Egyptians, which was perfect slavery, that he might take
them into his own service, which is perfect freedom, [Luk
1:74](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#074.md), [Luk
1:75](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#075.md). 2. This was not only laid before
them then, but it was with the greatest importunity imaginable pressed
upon them, [Jer 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#007.md). God not only
commanded it, but earnestly protested it to their fathers, when he
brought them into covenant with himself. Moses inculcated it again and
again, by precept upon precept and line upon line. 3. This was made the
condition of the relation between and God, which was so much their
honour and privilege: "So shall you be my people and I will be your God;
I will own you for mine, and you may call upon me as yours;" this
intimates that, if they refused to obey, they could no longer claim the
benefit of the relation. 4. It was upon these terms that the land of
Canaan was given them for a possession: Obey my voice, that I may
perform the oath sworn to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with
milk and honey, [Jer 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#005.md). God was
ready to fulfil the promise, but then they must fulfil the condition; if
not, the promise is void, and it is just with God to turn them out of
possession. Being brought in upon their good behaviour, they had no
wrong done them if they were turned out upon their ill behaviour.
Obedience was the rent reserved by the lease, with a power to re-enter
for non-payment. 5. This obedience was not only made a condition of the
blessing, but was required under the penalty of a curse. This is
mentioned first here ([Jer 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#003).md), that
they might, if possible, be awakened by the terrors of the Lord: Cursed
be the man, though it were but a single person, that obeys not the words
of this covenant, much more when it is the body of the nation that
rebels. There are curses of the covenant as well as blessings: and Moses
set before them not only life and good, but death and evil ([Deu
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#015).md), so that they had fair warning
given them of the fatal consequences of disobedience. 6. Lest this
covenant should be forgotten, and, because out of mind, should be
thought out of date, God had from time to time called to them to
remember it, and by his servants the prophets had made a continual claim
of this rent, so that they could not plead, in excuse of their
non-payment, that it had never been demanded; from the day when he
brought them out of Egypt to this day (and that was nearly 1000 years)
he had been, in one way or other, at sundry times and in divers manners,
protesting to them the necessity of obedience. God keeps an account how
long we have enjoyed the means of grace and how powerful those means
have been, how often we have been not only spoken to, but protested to,
concerning our duty. 7. This covenant was consented to ([Jer
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#005).md): Then answered I, and said, So
be it, O Lord! These are the words of the prophet, expressing either,
(1.) His own consent to the covenant for himself, and his desire to have
the benefit of it. God promised Canaan to the obedient: "Lord," says he,
"I take thee at thy word, I will be obedient; let me have my inheritance
in the land of promise, of which Canaan is a type." Or, (2.) His good
will, and good wish, that his people might have the benefit of it.
"Amen; Lord, let them still be kept in possession of this good land, and
not turned out of it; make good the promise to them." Or, (3.) His
people's consent to the covenant: "Then answered I, in the name of the
people, So be it." Taking it in this sense, it refers to the declared
consent which the people gave to the covenant, not only to the precepts
of it when they said, All that the Lord shall say unto us we will do and
will be obedient, but to the penalties when they said Amen to all the
curses upon Mount Ebal. The more solemnly we have engaged ourselves to
God the more reason we have to hope that the engagement will be
perpetual; and yet here it did not prove so.

III\. He charges them with breach of covenant, such a breach as amounted
to a forfeiture of their charter, [Jer
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#008.md). God had said again and again, by
his law and by his prophets, "Obey my voice, do as you are bidden, and
all shall be well;" yet they obeyed not; and, because they were resolved
not to submit their souls to God's commandments, they would not so much
as incline their ears to them, but got as far as they could out of call:
They walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart, followed
their own inventions; every man did as his fancy and humour led him,
right or wrong, lawful or unlawful, both in their devotions and in their
conversations; see [Jer 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#024.md). What
then could they expect, but to fall under the curse of the covenant,
since they would not comply with the commands and conditions of it?
Therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, that
is, all the threatenings contained in it, because they did not what they
were commanded. Note, The words of the covenant shall not fall to the
ground. If we do not by our obedience qualify ourselves for the
blessings of it, we shall by our disobedience bring ourselves under the
curses of it. That which aggravated their defection from God, and
rebellion against him, was that it was general, and as it were by
consent, [Jer 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#009.md), [Jer
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#010.md). Jeremiah himself saw that many
lived in open disobedience to God, but the Lord told him that the matter
was worse than he thought of: A conspiracy is found among them, by him
whose eye is upon the hidden works of darkness. There is a combination
against God and religion, a dangerous design formed to overthrow God's
government and bring in the pretenders, the counterfeit deities. This
intimates that they were wilful and deliberate in wickedness (they
rebelled against God, not through incogitancy, but presumptuously, and
with a high hand), - that they were subtle and ingenious in wickedness,
and carried on their plot against religion with a great deal of art and
contrivance, - that they were linked together in the design, and, as is
usual among conspirators, engaged to stand by one another in it and to
live and die together; they were resolved to go through with it. A
cursed conspiracy! O that there were not the like in our day! Observe,
1. What the conspiracy was. They designed to overthrow divine
revelation, and set that aside, and persuade people not to hear, not to
heed, the words of God. They did all they could to derogate from the
authority of the scriptures and to lessen the value of them; they
designed to draw people after other gods to serve them, to consult them
as their oracles and make court to them as their benefactors. Human
reason shall be their god, a light within their god, an infallible judge
their god, saints and angels their gods, the god of this or the other
nation shall be theirs; thus, under several disguises, they are in the
same confederacy against the Lord and against his anointed. 2. Who were
in conspiracy. One would have expected find some foreigners ring-leaders
in it; but no, (1.) The inhabitants of Jerusalem are in conspiracy with
the men of Judah; city and country agree in this, however they may
differ in other things. (2.) Those of this generation seem to be in
conspiracy with those of the foregoing generation, to carry on the war
from age to age against religion: They are turned back to the iniquities
of their forefathers, and have risen up in their stead, a seed of
evil-doers, and increase of sinful men, [Num
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#014.md). In Josiah's time there had been
a reformation, but after this death the people returned to the
idolatries which then they had renounced. (3.) Judah and Israel, the
kingdom of the ten tribes and that of the two, that were often at
daggers - drawing one with another, were yet in a conspiracy to break
the covenant God had made with their fathers, even with the heads of all
the twelve tribes. The house of Israel began the revolt, but the house
of Judah soon came into the conspiracy. Now what else could be expected
but that god should take severe methods, both for the chastising of the
conspirators and the crushing of this conspiracy; for none ever hardened
his heart thus against God and prospered? He that rolls this stone will
find it return upon him.

[Jeremiah 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 11:11</span></span>

This paragraph, which contains so much of God's wrath, might very well
be expected to follow upon that which goes next before, which contained
so much of his people's sin. When God found so much evil among them we
cannot think it strange if it follows, Therefore I will bring evil upon
them ([Jer 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#011).md), the evil of
punishment for the evil of sin; and there is no remedy, no relief: the
decree has gone forth and the sentence will be executed.

I. They cannot help themselves, but will be found too weak to contest
with God's judgments: it is evil which they shall not be able to escape,
or to go forth out of, by any evasion whatsoever. Note, Those that will
not submit to God's government shall not be able to escape his wrath.
There is no fleeing from his justice, no avoiding his cognizance. Evil
pursues sinners and entangles them in snares out of which they cannot
extricate themselves.

II\. Their God will not help them; his providence shall no way favour
them: Though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken to them. In
their affliction they will seek the God whom before they slighted, and
cry to him whom before they would not vouchsafe to speak to. But how can
they expect to speed? For he has plainly told us that he that turns away
his ears from hearing the law, as they did, for they inclined not their
ear ([Jer 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#008).md), even his prayer shall
be an abomination to him, as the word of the Lord was now to them a
reproach.

III\. Their idols shall not help them, [Jer
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#012.md). They shall go, and cry to the
gods to whom they now offer incense, and put them in mind of the costly
services wherewith they had honoured them, expecting they should now
have relief from them, but in vain. They shall be sent to the gods whom
they served ([Jdg 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#014.md); [Deu
32:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#037.md), [Deu
32:38](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#038).md), and what the better? They
shall not save them at all, shall do nothing towards their salvation,
nor give them any prospect of it; they shall not afford them the least
comfort, nor relief, nor mitigation of their trouble. It is God only
that is a friend at need, a present powerful help in time of trouble.
The idols cannot help themselves; how then should they help their
worshippers? Those that make idols of the world and the flesh will in
vain have recourse to them in a day of distress. If the idols could have
done any real kindness to their worshippers, they would have done it for
this people, who had renounced the true God to embrace them, had
multiplied them according to the number of their cities ([Jer
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#013).md), nay, in Jerusalem, according
to the number of their streets. Suspecting both their sufficiency and
their readiness to help them, they must have many, lest a few would not
serve; they must have them dispersed in every corner, lest they should
be out of the way when they had occasion for them. In Jerusalem, the
city which God had chosen to put his name there, publicly in the streets
of Jerusalem, in every street, they had altars to that shameful thing,
that shame, even to Baal, which they ought to have been ashamed of, with
which they did reproach the Lord and bring confusion upon themselves.
But now in their distress their many gods, and many altars, should stand
them in stead. Note, Those that will not be ashamed of their commission
of sin as a wicked thing will be ashamed of their expectations from sin
as a fruitless thing.

IV\. Jeremiah's prayers shall not help them, [Jer
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#014.md). What God had said to him before
([Jer 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#016).md) he here says again, Pray
not thou for this people. This is not designed for a command to the
prophet, so much as for a threatening to the people, that they should
have no benefit by the prayers of their friends for them. God would give
no encouragement to the prophets to pray for them, would not stir up the
spirit of prayer, but cast a damp upon it, would put it into their
hearts to pray, not for the body of the people, but for the remnant
among them, to pray for their eternal salvation, not for their
deliverance from the temporal judgments that were coming upon them; and
what other prayers were put up for them should not be heard. Those are
in a sad case indeed that are cut off from the benefit of prayer. "I
will not hear them when they cry, and therefore to not thou pray for
them." Note, Those that have so far thrown themselves out of God's
favour that he will not hear their prayers cannot expect benefit by the
prayers of others for them.

V. The profession they make of religion shall stand them in no stead,
[Jer 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#015.md). They were originally God's
beloved, his spouse, he was married to them by the covenant of
peculiarity; even the unbelieving Jews are said to be beloved for the
fathers' sake, [Rom 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#028.md). As such
they had a place in God's house; they were admitted to worship in the
courts of his temple; they partook of God's altar; they ate of the flesh
of their peace-offerings here called the holy flesh, which God had the
honour of and they had the comfort of. This they gloried in, and trusted
to. What harm could come to those who were God's beloved, who were under
the protection of his house? Even when they did evil yet they rejoiced
and gloried in this, made a mighty noise of this. And when their evil
was (so the margin reads it), when trouble came upon them, they rejoiced
in this, and made this their confidence; but their confidence would
deceive them, for God has rejected it, they themselves having forfeited
the privileges they so much boasted of. They have wrought lewdness with
many, have been guilty of spiritual whoredom, have worshipped many
idols; and therefore, 1. God's temple will yield them no protection; it
is fit that the adulteress, especially when she has so often repeated
her whoredoms and has grown so impudent in them and irreclaimable,
should be put away, and turned out of doors: "What has my beloved to do
in my house? She is a scandal to it, and therefore it shall no longer be
a shelter to her." 2. God's altar will yield them no satisfaction, nor
can they expect any comfort from that: "The holy flesh has passed from
thee, that is, an end will soon be put to thy sacrifices, when the
temple shall be laid in ruins; and where then will the holy flesh be,
that thou art so proud of?" A holy heart will be a comfort to us when
the holy flesh has passed from us; an inward principle of grace will
make up the want of the outward means of grace. But woe unto us if the
departure of the holy flesh be accompanied with the departure of the
Holy Spirit.

VI\. God's former favours to them shall stand them in no stead, [Jer
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#016.md), [Jer
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#017.md). Their remembrance of them shall
be no comfort to them under their troubles, and God's remembrance of
them shall be no argument for their relief. 1. It is true God had done
great things for them; that people had been favourites above any people
under the sun; they had been the darlings of heaven. God had called
Israel's name a green olive-tree, and had made them so, for he miscalls
nothing; he had planted them ([Jer
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#017).md), had formed them into a people,
with all the advantages they could have to make them a fruitful and
flourishing people, so good was their law and so good was their land.
One would think no other than that a people so planted, so watered, so
cultivated, should be, as the olive-tree is, ever green, in respect both
of piety and prosperity, [Psa 52:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#008.md).
God called them fair and of goodly fruit, both good for food and
pleasant to the eye, both amiable and serviceable to God and man, for
which the greenness and fatness of the olive both are honoured, [Jdg
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#009.md). 2. It is as true that they have
done evil things against God. He had planted them a green olive, a good
olive, but they had degenerated into a wild olive, [Rom
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017.md). Both the house of Israel. and
the house of Judah had done evil, had provoked God to anger in burning
incense unto Baal, setting up other mediators between them and the
supreme God besides the promised Messiah; nay, setting up other gods in
competition with the true and living God, for they had gods many, as
well as lords many. 3. When they have conducted themselves so ill they
can expect no other than that, notwithstanding what good he has done to
them and designed for them, he should now bring upon them the evil he
has pronounced against them. He that planted this green olive-tree, and
expected fruit from it, finding it barren and grown wild, has kindled
fire upon it, to burn it as it stands; for, being without fruit, it is
twice dead, plucked up by the roots ([Jde
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#012).md), it is cut down and cast into
the fire, the fittest place for trees that cumber the ground, [Mat
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#010.md). The branches of it, the high and
lofty boughs (so the word signifies), are broken are broken down, both
princes and priests cut off. And thus it proves that the evil done
against God, to provoke him to anger, is really done against themselves;
they wrong their own souls; God is out of their reach, but they ruin
themselves. See [Jer 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#019.md). Note, Every
sin against God is a sin against ourselves, and so it will be found
sooner or later.

[Jeremiah 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 11:18</span></span>

The prophet Jeremiah has much in his writings concerning himself, much
more than Isaiah had, the times he lived in being very troublesome. Here
we have (as it should seem) the beginning of his sorrows, which arose
from the people of his own city, Anathoth, a priest's city, and yet a
malignant one. Observe here,

I. Their plot against him, [Jer 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#019.md).
They devised devices against him, laid their heads together to contrive
how they might be in the most plausible and effectual manner the death
of him. Malice is ingenious in its devices, as well as industrious in
its prosecutions. They said concerning Jeremiah, Let us destroy the tree
with the fruit thereof - a proverbial expression, meaning, "Let us
utterly destroy him root and branch. Let us destroy both the father and
the family" (as, when Naboth was put to death for treason, his sons were
put to death with him), or rather "both the prophet and the prophecy;
let us kill the one and defeat the other. Let us cut him off from the
land of the living, as a false prophet, and load him with ignominy and
disgrace, that his name may be no more remembered with respect. Let us
sink his reputation, and so spoil the credit of his predictions." This
was their plot; and 1. It was a cruel one; but so cruel have the
persecutors of God's prophets been. They hunt for no less than the
precious life, and very precious the lives are that they hunt for. But,
(2.) It was a baffled one. They thought to put an end to his days, but
he survived most of his enemies; they thought to blast his memory, but
it lives to this day, and will be blessed while time lasts.

II\. The information which God gave him of this conspiracy against him.
He knew nothing of it himself, so artfully had they concealed it; he
came to Anathoth, meaning no harm to them and therefore fearing no harm
from them, like a lamb or an ox, that thinks he is driven as usual to
the field, when he is brought to the slaughter; so little did poor
Jeremiah dream of the design his citizens that hated him had upon him.
None of his friends could, and none of his enemies would, give him any
notice of his danger, that he might shift for his own safety, as Paul's
sister's son gave him intelligence of the Jews that were lying in wait
for him. There is but a step between Jeremiah and death; but then the
Lord gave him knowledge of it, by dream or vision, or impression upon
his spirit, that he might save himself, as the king of Israel did upon
the notice Elisha gave him, [Kg2 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#010.md).
Thus he came to know it. God showed him their doings; and such were
their devices that the discovering of them was the defeating of them. If
God had not let him know his own danger, it would have been improved by
unreasonable men against the reputation of his predictions, that he who
foretold the ruin of his country could not foresee his own peril and
avoid it. See what care God takes of his prophets: He suffers no man to
do them wrong; all the rage of their enemies cannot prevail to take them
off till they have finished their testimony. God knows all the secret
designs of his and his people's enemies, and can, when he pleases, make
them know. A bird of the air shall carry the voice.

III\. His appeal to God hereupon, [Jer
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#020.md). His eye is to God as the Lord
of hosts, that judges righteously. It is a matter of comfort to us, when
men deal unjustly with us, that we have a God to go to who does and will
plead the cause of injured innocency and appear against the injurious.
God's justice, which is a terror to the wicked, is a comfort to the
godly. His eye is towards him as the God that tries the reins and the
heart, that perfectly sees what is in man, what are his thoughts and
intents. He knew the integrity that was in Jeremiah's heart, and that he
was not the man they represented him to be. He knew the wickedness that
was in their hearts, though ever so cunningly concealed and disguised.
Now, 1. Jeremiah prays judgment against them: "Let me see thy vengeance
on them, that is, do justice between me and them in such a way as thou
pleasest." Some think there was something of human frailty in this
prayer; at least Christ has taught us another lesson, both by precept
and by pattern, which is to pray for our persecutors. Others think it
comes from a pure zeal for the glory of God and a pious and prophetic
indignation against men that were by profession priests, the Lord's
ministers, and yet were so desperately wicked as to fly out against one
that did them no harm, merely for the service he did to God. This
petition was a prediction that he should see God's vengeance on them. 2.
He refers his cause entirely to the judgment of God: "Unto thee have I
revealed my cause; to thee I have committed it, not desiring nor
expecting to interest any other in it." Note, It is our comfort, when we
are wronged, that we have a God to commit our cause to, and our duty to
commit it to him, with a resolution to acquiesce in his definitive
sentence, to subscribe, and not prescribe, to him.

IV\. Judgment given against his persecutors, the men of Anathoth. It was
to no purpose for him to appeal to the courts at Jerusalem, he could not
have justice done him there: the priests there would stand by the
priests at Anathoth, and rather second them than discountenance them;
but God will therefore take cognizance of the cause himself, and we are
sure that his judgment is according to truth. Here is, 1. Their crime
recited, on which the sentence is grounded, [Jer
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#021.md). They sought the prophet's life,
for they forbad him to prophesy upon pain of death; they were resolved
either to silence him or to slay him. The provocation he gave them was
his prophesying in the name of the Lord without license from those that
were the governors of the city which he was a member of, and not
prophesying such smooth things as they always bespoke. Their forbidding
him to prophesy was in effect seeking his life, for it was seeking to
defeat the end and business of his life and to rob him of the comfort of
it. It is as bad to God's faithful ministers to have their mouth stopped
as to have their breath stopped. But especially when it was resolved
that if he did prophesy, as certainly he would notwithstanding their
inhibition, he should die by their hand; they would be accusers, judges,
executioners, and all. It used to be said that a prophet could not
perish but at Jerusalem, for there the great council sat; but so bitter
were the men of Anathoth against Jeremiah that they would undertake to
be the death of him themselves. A prophet then shall find not only no
honour, but no favour, in his own country. 2. The sentence passed upon
them for this crime, [Jer 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#022.md), [Jer
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#023.md). God says, I will punish them;
let me alone to deal with them. I will visit this upon them; so the word
is. God will enquire into it and reckon for it. Two of God's four sore
judgments shall serve to ruin their town: - The sword shall devour their
young men, though they were young priests, not men of war (their
character shall not be their protection), and famine shall destroy the
children, sons and daughters, that tarry at home, which is a more
grievous death than that by the sword, [Lam
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#009.md). The destruction shall be final
([Jer 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#023).md): There shall be no
remnant of them left, none to be the seed of another generation. They
sought Jeremiah's life, and therefore they shall die; they would destroy
him root and branch, that his name might be no more remembered, and
therefore there shall be no remnant of them; and herein the Lord is
righteous. Thus evil is brought upon them, even the year of their
visitation, and that is evil enough, a recompence according to their
deserts. Then shall Jeremiah see his desire upon his enemies. Note,
Their condition is sad who have the prayers of good ministers and good
people against them.
