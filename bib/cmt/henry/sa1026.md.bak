### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 26:0</span></span>

David's troubles from Saul here begin again; and the clouds return after
the rain, when one would have hoped the storm had blown over, and the
sky had cleared upon that side; but after Saul had owned his fault in
persecuting David, and acknowledged David's title to the crown, yet here
he revives the persecution, so perfectly lost was he to all sense of
honour and virtue. I. The Ziphites informed him where David was ([Sa1
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#001).md), and thereupon he marched out
with a considerable force in quest of him ([Sa1
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#002.md), [Sa1
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#003).md). II. David gained intelligence
of his motions ([Sa1 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#004).md), and took a
view of his camp ([Sa1 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#005).md). III. He
and one of his men ventured into his camp in the night and found him and
all his guards fast asleep ([Sa1 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#006.md),
[Sa1 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#007).md). IV. David, though much
urged to it by his companions, would not take away Saul's life, but only
carried off his spear and his cruse of water ([Sa1
26:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#008).md). V. He produced these as a
further witness for him that he did not design any ill to Saul, and
reasoned with him upon his conduct ([Sa1
26:13-20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#013).md). VI. Saul was hereby
convinced of his error, and once more desisted from persecuting David
([Sa1 26:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#021).md). The story is much
like that which we had (ch. 24). In both David is delivered out of
Saul's hand, and Saul out of David's.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 26:1</span></span>

Here, 1. Saul gets information of David's movements and acts
offensively. The Ziphites came to him and told him where David now was,
in the same place where he was when they formerly betrayed him, [Sa1
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#019.md). Perhaps (though it is not
mentioned) Saul had given them intimation, under-hand, that he continued
his design against David, and would be glad of their assistance. If not,
they were very officious to Saul, aware of what would please him, and
very malicious against David, to whom they despaired of ever reconciling
themselves, and therefore they stirred up Saul (who needed no such spur)
against him, [Sa1 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#001.md). For aught we
know, Saul would have continued in the same good mind that he was in
([Sa1 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#017).md), and would not have given
David this fresh trouble, if the Ziphites had not put him on. See what
need we have to pray to God that, since we have so much of the tinner of
corruption in our own hearts, the sparks of temptation may be kept far
from us, lest, if they come together, we be set on fire of hell. Saul
readily caught at the information, and went down with an army of 3000
men to the place where David hid himself, [Sa1
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#002.md). How soon do unsanctified hearts
lose the good impressions which their convictions have made upon them
and return with the dog to their vomit!

2\. David gets information of Saul's movements and acts defensively. He
did not march out to meet and fight him; he sought only his own safety,
not Saul's ruin; therefore he abode in the wilderness ([Sa1
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#003).md), putting thereby a great force
upon himself, and curbing the bravery of his own spirit by a silent
retirement, showing more true valour than he could have done by an
irregular resistance. (1.) He had spies who informed him of Saul's
descent, that he had come in very deed ([Sa1
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#004)..md); for he would not believe that
Saul would deal so basely with him till he had the utmost evidence of
it. (2.) He observed with his own eyes how Saul was encamped, [Sa1
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#005.md). He came towards the place where
Saul and his men had pitched their tents, so near as to be able,
undiscovered, to take a view of their entrenchments, probably in the
dusk of the evening.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 26:6</span></span>

Here is, I. David's bold adventure into Saul's camp in the night,
accompanied only by his kinsman Abishai, the son of Zeruiah. He proposed
it to him and to another of his confidants ([Sa1
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#006).md), but the other either declined
it as too dangerous an enterprise, or at least was content that Abishai,
who was forward to it, should run the risk of it rather than himself.
Whether David was prompted to do this by his own courage, or by an
extraordinary impression upon his spirits, or by the oracle, does not
appear; but, like Gideon, he ventured through the guards, with a special
assurance of the divine protection.

II\. The posture he found the camp in Saul lay sleeping in the trench,
or, as some read it, in his chariot, and in the midst of his carriages,
with his spear stuck in the ground by him, to be ready if his quarters
should by beaten up ([Sa1 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#007).md); and
all the soldiers, even those that were appointed to stand sentinel, were
fast asleep, [Sa1 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#012.md). Thus were
their eyes closed and their hands bound, for a deep sleep from the Lord
had fallen upon them; something extraordinary there was in it that they
should all be asleep together, and so fast asleep that David and Abishai
walked and talked among them, and yet none of them stirred. Sleep, when
God gives it to his beloved, is their rest and refreshment; but he can,
when he pleases, make it to his enemies their imprisonment. Thus are the
stout-hearted spoiled; they have slept their sleep, and none of the men
of might have found their hands, at thy rebuke, O God of Jacob! [Psa
76:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#005.md), [Psa
76:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#006.md). It was a deep sleep from the
Lord, who has the command of the powers of nature, and makes them to
serve his purposes as he pleases. Whom God will disable, or destroy, he
binds up with a spirit of slumber, [Rom
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#008.md). How helpless do Saul and all his
forces lie, all, in effect, disarmed and chained! and yet nothing is
done to them; they are only rocked asleep. How easily can God weaken the
strongest, befool the wisest, and baffle the most watchful! Let all his
friends therefore trust him and all his enemies fear him.

III\. Abishai's request to David for a commission to dispatch Saul with
the spear that stuck at his bolster, which (now that he lay so fair) he
undertook to do at one blow, [Sa1
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#008.md). He would not urge David to kill
him himself, because he had declined doing this before when he had a
similar opportunity; but he begged earnestly that David would give him
leave to do it, pleading that he was his enemy, not only cruel and
implacable, but false and perfidious, whom no reason would rule nor
kindness work upon, and that God had now delivered him into his hand,
and did in effect bid him strike. The last advantage he had of this kind
was indeed but accidental, when Saul happened to be in the cave with him
at the same time. But in this there was something extraordinary; the
deep sleep that had fallen on Saul and all his guards was manifestly
from the Lord, so that it was a special providence which gave him this
opportunity; he ought not therefore to let it slip.

IV\. David's generous refusal to suffer any harm to be done to Saul, and
in it a resolute adherence to his principles of loyalty, [Sa1
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#009.md). David charged Abishai not to
destroy him, would not only not do it himself, but not permit another to
do it. And he gave two reasons for it: - 1. It would be a sinful affront
to God's ordinance. Saul was the Lord's anointed, king of Israel by the
special appointment and nomination of the God of Israel, the power that
was, and to resist him was to resist the ordinance of God, [Rom
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#002.md). No man could do it and be
guiltless. The thing he feared was guilt and his concern respected his
innocence more than his safety. 2. It would be a sinful anticipation of
God's providence. God had sufficiently shown him, in Nabal's case, that,
if he left it to him to avenge him, he would do it in due time.
Encouraged therefore by his experience in that instance, he resolves to
wait till God shall think fit to avenge him on Saul, and he will by no
means avenge himself ([Sa1 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#010).md):
"The Lord shall smite him, as he did Nabal, with some sudden stroke, or
he shall die in battle (as it proved he did soon after), or, if not, his
day shall come to die a natural death, and I will contentedly wait till
then, rather than force my way to the promised crown by any indirect
methods." The temptation indeed was very strong; but, if he should
yield, he would sin against God, and therefore he will resist the
temptation with the utmost resolution ([Sa1
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#011).md): "The Lord forbid that I should
stretch forth my hand against the Lord's anointed; no, I will never do
it, nor suffer it to be done." Thus bravely does he prefer his
conscience to his interest and trusts God with the issue.

V. The improvement he made of this opportunity for the further evidence
of his own integrity. He and Abishai carried away the spear and cruse of
water which Saul had by his bed-side ([Sa1
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#012).md), and, which was very strange,
none of all the guards were aware of it. If a physician had given them
the strongest opiate or stupifying dose, they could not have been faster
locked up with sleep. Saul's spear which he had by him for defence, and
his cup of water which he had for his refreshment, were both stolen from
him while he slept. Thus do we lose our strength and our comfort when we
are careless, and secure, and off our watch.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 26:13</span></span>

David having got safely from Saul's camp himself, and having brought
with him proofs sufficient that he had been there, posts himself
conveniently, so that they might hear him and yet not reach him ([Sa1
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#013).md), and then begins to reason with
them upon what had passed.

I. He reasons ironically with Abner, and keenly banters him. David knew
well that it was from the mighty power of God that Abner and the rest of
the guards were cast into so deep a sleep, and that God's immediate hand
was in it; but he reproaches Abner as unworthy to be captain of the
lifeguards, since he could sleep when the king his master lay so much
exposed. By this it appears that the hand of God locked them up in this
deep sleep that, as soon as ever David had got out of danger, a very
little thing awakened them, even David's voice at a great distance
roused them, [Sa1 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#014.md). Abner got up
(we may suppose it early in a summer's morning) and enquired who called,
and disturbed the king's repose. "It is I," says David, and then he
upbraids him with his sleeping when he should have been upon his guard.
Perhaps Abner, looking upon David as a despicable enemy and one that
there was no danger from, had neglected to set a watch; however, he
himself ought to have been more wakeful. David, to put him into
confusion, told him, 1. That he had lost his honour ([Sa1
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#015).md): "Art not thou a man? (so the
word is), a man in office, that art bound, by the duty of thy place, to
inspect the soldiery? Art not thou in reputation for a valiant man? So
thou wouldst be esteemed, a man of such courage and conduct that there
is none like thee; but now thou art shamed for ever. Thou a general!
Thou, a sluggard!" 2. That he deserved to lose his head ([Sa1
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#016).md): "You are all worthy to die, by
martial law, for being off your guard, when you had the king himself
asleep in the midst of you. Ecce signum - Behold this token. See where
the king's spear is, in the hand of him whom the king himself is pleased
to count his enemy. Those that took away this might as easily and safely
have taken away his life. Now see who are the king's best friends, you
that neglected him and left him exposed or I that protected him when he
was exposed. You pursue me as worthy to die, and irritate Saul against
me; but who is worthy to die now?" Note, Sometimes those that unjustly
condemn others are justly left to fall into condemnation themselves.

II\. He reasons seriously and affectionately with Saul. By this time he
was so well awake as to hear what was said, and to discern who said it
([Sa1 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#017).md): Is this thy voice, my
son David? In the same manner he had expressed his relentings, [Sa1
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#016.md). He had given his wife to
another and yet calls him son, thirsted after his blood and yet is glad
to hear his voice. Those are bad indeed that have never any convictions
of good, nor ever sincerely utter good expressions. And now David has as
fair an opportunity of reaching Saul's conscience as he had just now of
taking away his life. This he lays hold on, though not of that, and
enters into a close argument with him, concerning the trouble he still
continued to give him, endeavouring to persuade him to let fall the
prosecution and be reconciled.

1\. He complains of the very melancholy condition he was brought into by
the enmity of Saul against him. Two things he laments: - (1.) That he
was driven from his master and from his business: "My lord pursues after
his servant, [Sa1 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#018.md). How gladly
would I serve thee as formerly if my service might be accepted! but,
instead of being owned as a servant, I am pursued as a rebel, and my
lord is my enemy, and he whom I would follow with respect compels me to
flee from him." (2.) That he was driven from his God and from his
religion; and this was a much greater grievance than the former ([Sa1
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#019).md): "They have driven me out from
the inheritance of the Lord, have made Canaan too hot for me, at least
the inhabited parts of it, have forced me into the deserts and
mountains, and will, ere long, oblige me entirely to quit the country."
And that which troubled him was not so much that he was driven out from
his own inheritance as that he was driven out from the inheritance of
the Lord, the holy land. It should be more comfortable to us to think of
God's title to our estates and his interest in them then of our own, and
that with them we may honour him then that with them we may maintain
ourselves. Nor was it so much his trouble that he was constrained to
live among strangers as that he was constrained to live among the
worshippers of strange gods and was thereby thrust into temptation to
join with them in their idolatrous worship. His enemies did, in effect,
send him to go and serve other gods, and perhaps he had heard that some
of them had spoken to that purport of him. Those that forbid our
attendance on God's ordinances do what in them lies to estrange us from
God and to make us heathens. If David had not been a man of
extraordinary grace, and firmness to his religion, the ill usage he met
with from his own prince and people, who were Israelites and worshippers
of the true God, would have prejudiced him against the religion they
professed and have driven him to communicate with idolaters. "If these
be Israelites," he might have said, "let me live and die with
Philistines;" and no thanks to them that their conduct had not that
effect. We are to reckon that the greatest injury that can be done us
which exposes us to sin. Of those who thus led David into temptation he
here says, Cursed be they before the Lord. Those fall under a curse that
thrust out those whom God receives, and send those to the devil who are
dear to God.

2\. He insists upon his own innocency: What have I done or what evil is
in my hand? [Sa1 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#018.md). He had the
testimony of his conscience for him that he had never done nor ever
designed any mischief to the person, honour, or government, of his
prince, nor to any of the interests of his country. He had lately had
Saul's own testimony concerning him ([Sa1
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#017).md): Thou art more righteous than
I. It was very unreasonable and wicked for Saul to pursue him as a
criminal, when he could not charge him with any crime.

3\. He endeavours to convince Saul that his pursuit of him is not only
wrong, but mean, and much below him: "The king of Israel, whose dignity
is great, and who has so much other work to do, has come out to seek a
flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains," [Sa1
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#020.md) - a poor game for the king of
Israel to pursue. He compares himself to a partridge, a vert innocent
harmless bird, which, when attempts are made upon its life, flies if it
can, but makes no resistance. And would Saul bring the flower of his
army into the field only to hunt one poor partridge? What a
disparagement was this to his honour! What a stain would it be on his
memory to trample upon so weak and patient as well as so innocent an
enemy! [Jam 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#006.md), You have killed the
just, and he doth not resist you.

4\. He desires that the core of the controversy may be searched into and
some proper method taken to bring it to an end, [Sa1
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#019.md). Saul himself could not say that
justice put him on thus to persecute David, or that he was obliged to do
it for the public safety. David was not willing to say (though it was
very true) that Saul's own envy and malice put him on to do it; and
therefore he concludes it must be attributed either to the righteous
judgment of God or to the unrighteous designs of evil men. Now, (1.) "If
the Lord have stirred thee up against me, either in displeasure to me
(taking this way to punish me for my sins against him, though, as to
thee, I am guiltless) or in displeasure to thee, if it be the effect of
that evil spirit from the Lord which troubles thee, let him accept an
offering from us both - let us join in making our peace with God,
reconciling ourselves to him, which may be done, by sacrifice; and then
I hope the sin will be pardoned, whatever it is, and the trouble, which
is so great a vexation both to thee and me, will come to an end." See
the right method of peace-making; let us first make God our friend by
Christ the great Sacrifice, and then all other enmities shall be slain,
[Eph 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#016.md); [Pro
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#007). But, (2..md) "If thou art incited
to it by wicked men, that incense thee against me, cursed be they before
the Lord," that is, they are very wicked people, and it is fit that they
should be abandoned as such, and excluded from the king's court and
councils. He decently lays the blame upon the evil counsellors who
advised the king to that which was dishonourable and dishonest, and
insists upon it that they be removed from about him and forbidden his
presence, as men cursed before the Lord, and then he hoped he should
gain his petition, which is ([Sa1
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#020).md), "Let not my blood fall to the
earth, as thou threatenest, for it is before the face of the Lord, who
will take cognizance of the wrong and avenge it." Thus pathetically does
David plead with Saul for his life, and, in order to that, for his
favourable opinion of him.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 26:21</span></span>

Here is, I. Saul's penitent confession of his fault and folly in
persecuting David and his promise to do so no more. This second instance
of David's respect to him wrought more upon him than the former, and
extorted from him better acknowledgements, [Sa1
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#021.md). 1. He owns himself melted and
quite overcome by David's kindness to him: "My soul was precious in thy
eyes this day, which, I thought, had been odious!" 2. He acknowledges he
has done very wrong to persecute him, that he has therein acted against
God's law (I have sinned), and against his own interest (I have played
the fool), in pursuing him as an enemy who would have been one of his
best friends, if he could but have thought so. "Herein (says he) I have
erred exceedingly, and wronged both thee and myself." Note, Those that
sin play the fool and err exceedingly, those especially that hate and
persecute God's people, [Job 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#028.md). 3.
He invites him to court again: Return, my son David. Those that have
understanding will see it to be their interest to have those about them
that behave themselves wisely, as David did, and have God with them. 4.
He promises him that he will not persecute him as he has done, but
protect him: I will no more do thee harm. We have reason to think,
according to the mind he was now in, that he meant as he said, and yet
neither his confession nor his promise of amendment came from a
principle of true repentance.

II\. David's improvement of Saul's convictions and confessions and the
evidence he had to produce of his own sincerity. He desired that one of
the footmen might fetch the spear ([Sa1
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#022).md), and then ([Sa1
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#023).md), 1. He appeals to God as judge
of the controversy: The Lord render to every man his righteousness.
David, by faith, is sure that he will do it because he infallibly knows
the true characters of all persons and actions and is inflexibly just to
render to every man according to his work, and, by prayer, he desires he
would do it. Herein he does, in effect, pray against Saul, who had dealt
unrighteously and unfaithfully with him (Give them according to their
deeds, [Psa 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#004).md); but he principally
intends it as a prayer for himself, that God would protect him in his
righteousness and faithfulness, and also reward him, since Saul so ill
requited him. 2. He reminds Saul again of the proof he had now given of
his respect to him from a principle of loyalty: I would not stretch
forth my hand against the Lord's anointed, intimating to Saul that the
anointing oil was his protection, for which he was indebted to the Lord
and ought to express his gratitude to him (had he been a common person
David would not have been so tender of him), perhaps with this further
implication, that Saul knew, or had reason to think, David was the
Lord's anointed too, and therefore, by the same rule, Saul ought to be
as tender of David's life as David had been of his. 3. Not relying much
upon Saul's promises, he puts himself under God's protection and begs
his favour ([Sa1 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#024).md): "Let my life
be much set by in the eyes of the Lord, how light soever thou makest of
it." Thus, for his kindness to Saul, he takes God to be his paymaster,
which those may with a holy confidence do that do well and suffer for
it.

III\. Saul's prediction of David's advancement. He commends him ([Sa1
26:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#025).md): Blessed be thou, my son David.
So strong was the conviction Saul was now under of David's honesty that
he was not ashamed to condemn himself and applaud David, even in the
hearing of his own soldiers, who could not but blush to think that they
had come out so furiously against a man whom their master, when he meets
him, caresses thus. He foretels his victories, and his elevation at
last: Thou shalt do great things. Note, Those who make conscience of
doing that which is truly good may come, by the divine assistance, to do
that which is truly great. He adds, "Thou shalt also still prevail, more
and more," he means against himself, but is loth to speak that out. The
princely qualities which appeared in David - his generosity in sparing
Saul, his military authority in reprimanding Abner for sleeping, his
care of the public good, and the signal tokens of God's presence with
him - convinced Saul that he would certainly be advanced to the throne
at last, according to the prophecies concerning him.

Lastly, A palliative cure being thus made of the wound, they parted
friends. Saul returned to Gibeah re infect - without accomplishing his
design, and ashamed of the expedition he had made; but David could not
take his word so far as to return with him. Those that have once been
false are not easily trusted another time. Therefore David went on his
way. And, after this parting, it does not appear that ever Saul and
David saw one another again.
