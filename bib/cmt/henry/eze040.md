### [Ezekiel Chapter 40](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 40:0</span></span>

The waters of the sanctuary which this prophet saw in vision ([Eze
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001).md) are a proper representation of
this prophecy. Hitherto the waters have been sometimes but to the
ankles, in other places to the knees, or to the loins, but now the
waters have risen, and have become "a river which cannot be passed
over." Here is one continued vision, beginning at this chapter, to the
end of the book, which is justly looked upon to be one of the most
difficult portions of scripture in all the book of God. The Jews will
not allow any to read it till they are thirty years old, and tell those
who do read it that, though they cannot understand every thing in it,
"when Elias comes he will explain it." Many commentators, both ancient
and modern, have owned themselves at a loss what to make of it and what
use to make of it. But because it is hard to be understood we must not
therefore throw it by, but humbly search concerning it, get as far as we
can into it and as much as we can out of it, and, when we despair of
satisfaction in every difficulty we meet with, bless God that our
salvation does not depend upon it, but that things necessary are plain
enough, and wait till God shall reveal even this unto us. These chapters
are the more to be regarded because the last two chapters of the
Revelation seem to have a plain allusion to them, as [Rev
20:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#001.md) has to the foregoing prophecy
of Gog and Magog. Here is the vision of a glorious temple (in this
chapter and ch. 41 and 42), of God's taking possession of it (ch. 43),
orders concerning the priests that are to minister in this temple (ch.
44), the division of the land, what portion should be allotted for the
sanctuary, what for the city, and what for the prince, both in his
government of the people and his worship of God (ch. 45), and further
instructions for him and the people, ch. 46. After the vision of the
holy waters we have the borders of the holy land, and the portions
assigned to the tribes, and the dimensions and gates of the holy city,
ch. 47, 48. Some make this to represent what had been during the
flourishing state of the Jewish church, how glorious Solomon's temple
was in its best days, that the captives might see what they had lost by
sin and might be the more humbled. But that seems not probable. The
general scope of it I take to be, 1. To assure the captives that they
should not only return to their own land, and be settled there, which
had been often promised in the foregoing chapters, but that they should
have, and therefore should be encouraged to build, another temple, which
God would own, and where he would meet them and bless them, that the
ordinances of worship should be revived, and the sacred priesthood
should there attend; and, though they should not have a king to live in
such splendour as formerly, yet they should have a prince or ruler (who
is often spoken of in this vision), who should countenance the worship
of God among them and should himself be an example of diligent
attendance upon it, and that prince, priests, and people, should have a
very comfortable settlement and subsistence in their own land. 2. To
direct them to look further than all this, and to expect the coming of
the Messiah, who had before been prophesied of under the name of David
because he was the man that projected the building of the temple and
that should set up a spiritual temple, even the gospel-church, the glory
of which should far exceed that of Solomon's temple, and which should
continue to the end of time. The dimensions of these visionary buildings
being so large (the new temple more spacious than all the old Jerusalem
and the new Jerusalem of greater extent than all the land of Canaan)
plainly intimates, as Dr. Lightfoot observes, that these things cannot
be literally, but must spiritually, understood. At the gospel-temple,
erected by Christ and his apostles, was so closely connected with the
second material temple, was erected so carefully just at the time when
that fell into decay, that it might be ready to receive its glories when
it resigned them, that it was proper enough that they should both be
referred to in one and the same vision. Under the type and figure of a
temple and altar, priests and sacrifices, is foreshown the spiritual
worship that should be performed in gospel times, more agreeable to the
nature both of God and man, and that perfected at last in the kingdom of
glory, in which perhaps these visions will have their full
accomplishment, and some think in some happy and glorious state of the
gospel-church on this side heaven, in the latter days.

In this chapter we have, I. A general account of this vision of the
temple and city ([Eze 40:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#001).md). II. A
particular account of it entered upon; and a description given, 1. Of
the outside wall ([Eze 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#005).md). 2. Of
the east gate ([Eze 40:6-19](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#006).md). 3. Of
the north gate ([Eze 40:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#020).md). 4. Of
the south gate ([Eze 40:24-31](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#024).md) and the
chambers and other appurtenances belonging to these gates. 5. Of the
inner court, both towards the east and towards the south ([Eze
40:32-38](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#032).md). 6. Of the tables ([Eze
40:39-43](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#039).md). 7. Of the lodgings for the
singers and the priests ([Eze
40:44-47](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#044).md). 8. Of the porch of the
house ([Eze 40:48](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#048.md), [Eze
40:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#049).md).

[Ezekiel 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 40:1</span></span>

Here is, 1. The date of this vision. It was in the twenty-fifth year of
Ezekiel's captivity ([Eze 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#001).md), which
some compute to be the thirty-third year of the first captivity, and is
here said to be the fourteenth year after the city was smitten. See how
seasonably the clearest and fullest prospects of their deliverance were
given, when they were in the depth of their distress, and an assurance
of the return of the morning when they were in the midnight of their
captivity: "Then the hand of the Lord was upon me and brought me thither
to Jerusalem, now that it was in ruins, desolate and deserted" - a
pitiable sight to the prophet. 2. The scene where it was laid. The
prophet was brought, in the visions of God, to the land of Israel, [Eze
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#002.md). And it was not the first time
that he had been brought thither in vision. We had him carried to
Jerusalem to see it in its iniquity and shame ([Eze
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#003).md); here he is carried thither to
have a pleasing prospect of it in its glory, though its present aspect,
now that it was quite depopulated, was dismal. He was set upon a very
high mountain, as Moses upon the top of Pisgah, to view this land, which
was now a second time a land of promise, not yet in possession. From the
top of this mountain he saw as the frame of a city, the plan and model
of it; but this city was a temple as large as a city. The New Jerusalem
([Rev 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#022).md) had no temple therein;
this which we have here is all temple, which comes much to one. It is a
city for men to dwell in; it is a temple for God to dwell in; for in the
church on earth God dwells with men, in that in heaven men dwell with
God. Both these are framed in the counsel of God, framed by infinite
wisdom, and all very good. 3. The particular discoveries of this city
(which he had at first a general view of) were made to him by a man
whose appearance was like the appearance of brass ([Eze
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#003).md), not a created angel, but Jesus
Christ, who should be found in fashion as a man, that he might both
discover and build the gospel-temple. He brought him to this city, for
it is through Christ that we have both acquaintance with and access to
the benefits and privileges of God's house. He it is that shall build
the temple of the Lord, [Zac 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013.md). His
appearing like brass intimates both his brightness and his strength.
John, in vision, saw his feet like unto fine brass, [Rev
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#015.md). 4. The dimensions of this city
or temple, and the several parts of it, were taken with a line of flax
and a measuring reed, or rod ([Eze
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#003).md), as carpenters have both their
line and a wooden measure. The temple of God is built by line and rule;
and those that would let others into the knowledge of it must do it by
that line and rule. The church is formed according to the scripture, the
pattern in the mount. That is the line and the measuring reed that is in
the hand of Christ. With that doctrine and laws ought to be measured,
and examined by that; for then peace is upon the Israel of God when they
walk according to that rule. 5. Directions are here given to the prophet
to receive this revelation from the Lord and transmit it pure and entire
to the church, [Eze 40:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#004). (1..md) He must
carefully observe every thing that was said and done in this vision. His
attention is raised and engaged ([Eze
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#004).md): "Behold with thy eyes all that
is shown thee (do not only see it, but look intently upon it), and hear
with thy ears all that is said to thee; diligently hearken to it, and be
sure to set thy heart upon it; attend with a fixedness of thought and a
close application of mind." What we see of the works of God, and what we
hear of the word of God, will do us no good unless we set out hearts
upon it, as those that reckon ourselves nearly concerned in it, and
expect advantage to our souls by it. (2.) He must faithfully declare it
to the house of Israel, that they may have the comfort of it. Therefore
he receives, that he may give. Thus the Revelation of Jesus Christ was
lodged in the hands of John, that he might signify it to the churches,
[Rev 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001.md). And, because he is to
declare it as a message from God, he must therefore be fully apprised of
it himself and much affected with it. Note, Those who are to preach
God's word to others ought to study it well themselves and set their
hearts upon it. Now the reason given why he must both observe it himself
and declare it to the house of Israel is because to this intent he is
brought hither, and has it shown to him. Note, When the things of God
are shown to us it concerns us to consider to what intent they are shown
to us, and, when we are sitting under the ministry of the word, to
consider to what intent we are brought thither, that we may answer the
end of our coming, and may not receive the grace of God, in showing us
such things, in vain.

[Ezekiel 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 40:5</span></span>

The measuring-reed which was in the hand of the surveyor-general was
mentioned before, [Eze 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#003.md). Here we
are told ([Eze 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#005).md) what was the
exact length of it, which must be observed, because the house was
measured by it. It was six cubits long, reckoning, not by the common
cubit, but the cubit of the sanctuary, the sacred cubit, by which it was
fit that this holy house should be measured, and that was a hand-breadth
(that it, four inches) longer than the common cubit: the common cubit
was eighteen inches, this twenty-two, see [Eze
43:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#013.md). Yet some of the critics contend
that this measuring-reed was but six common cubits in length, and one
handbreadth added to the whole. The former seems more probable. Here is
an account,

I. Of the outer wall of the house, which encompassed it round, which was
three yards thick and three yards high, which denotes the separation
between the church and the world on every side and the divine protection
which the church is under. If a wall of this vast thickness will not
secure it, God himself will be a wall of fire round about it; whoever
attack it will do so at their peril.

II\. Of the several gates with the chambers adjoining to them. Here is
no mention of the outer court of all, which was called the court of the
Gentiles, some think because in gospel-times there should be such a vast
confluence of Gentiles to the church that their court should be left
unmeasured, to signify that the worshippers in that court should be
unnumbered, [Rev 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md), [Rev
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#011.md), [Rev
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#012.md).

1\. He begins with the east gate, because that was the usual way of
entering into the lower end of the temple, the holy of holies being at
the west end, in opposition to the idolatrous heathen that worshipped
towards the east. Now, in the account of this gate, observe, (1.) That
he went up to it by stairs ([Eze
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#006).md), for the gospel-church was
exalted above that of the Old Testament, and when we go to worship God
we must ascend; so is the call, [Rev
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#001.md). Come up hither. Sursum corda - Up
with your hearts. (2.) That the chambers adjoining to the gates were but
little chambers, about ten feet square, [Eze
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#007.md). These were for those to lodge in
who attended the service of the house. And it becomes such as are made
spiritual priests to God to content themselves with little chambers and
not to seek great things to themselves; so that we may but have a place
within the verge of God's court we have reason to be thankful though it
be in a little chamber, a mean apartment, though we be but door-keepers
there. (3.) The chambers, as they were each of them four-square,
denoting their stability and due proportion and their exact agreement
with the rule (for they were each of them one reed long and one reed
broad), so they were all of one measure, that there might be an equality
among the attendants on the service of the house. (4.) The chambers were
very many; for in our Father's house there are many mansions ([Joh
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#002).md), in his house above, and in that
here on earth. In the secret of his tabernacle shall those be hid, and
in a safe pavilion, whose desire is to dwell in the house of the Lord
all the days of their life, [Psa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md),
[Psa 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005.md). Some make these chambers to
represent the particular congregations of believers, which are parts of
the great temple, the universal church, which are, and must be, framed
by the scripture-line and rule, and which Jesus Christ takes the measure
of, that is, takes cognizance of, for he walks in the midst of the seven
golden candle-sticks. (5.) It is said ([Eze
40:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#014).md), He made also the posts. He
that now measured them was the same that made them; for Christ is the
builder of his church and therefore is best able to give us the
knowledge of it. And his reducing them to the rule and standard is
called his making them, for no account is made of them further than they
agree with that. To the law and to the testimony. (6.) Here are posts of
sixty cubits, which, some think, was literally fulfilled when Cyrus, in
his edict for rebuilding the temple at Jerusalem, ordered that the
height thereof should be sixty cubits, that is, thirty yards and more,
[Ezr 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#003). (7..md) Here were windows to
the little chambers, and windows to the posts and arches (that is, to
the cloisters below), and windows round about ([Eze
40:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#016).md), to signify the light from
heaven with which the church is illuminated; divine revelation is let
into it for instruction, direction, and comfort, to those that dwell in
God's house, light to work by, light to walk by, light to see themselves
and one another by. There were lights to the little chambers; even the
least, and least considerable, parts and members of the church, shall
have light afforded them. All thy children shall be taught of the Lord.
But they are narrow windows, as those in the temple, [Kg1
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#004.md). The discoveries made to the
church on earth are but narrow and scanty compared with what shall be in
the future state, when we shall no longer see through a glass darkly.
(8.) Divers courts are here spoken of, an outermost of all, then an
outer court, then an inner, and then the innermost of all, into which
the priests only entered, which (some think) may put us in mind "of the
diversities of gifts, and graces, and offices, in the several members of
Christ's mystical body here, as also of the several degrees of glory in
the courts and mansions of heaven, as there are stars in several spheres
and stars of several magnitudes in the fixed firmament." English
Annotations. Some draw nearer to God than others and have a more
intimate acquaintance with divine things; but to a child of God a day in
any of his courts is better than a thousand elsewhere. These courts had
porches, or piazzas, round them, for the shelter of those that attended
in them from wind and weather; for when we are in the way of our duty to
God we may believe ourselves to be under his special protection, that he
will graciously provide for us, nay, that he will himself be to us a
covert from the storm and tempest, [Isa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md), [Isa
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#006). (9..md) On the posts were palm-trees
engraven ([Eze 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#016).md), to signify that
the righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree in the courts of God's
house, [Psa 92:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012.md). The more they are
depressed with the burden of affliction the more strongly do they grow,
as they say of the palm-trees. It likewise intimates the saints' victory
and triumph over their spiritual enemies; they have palms in their hands
([Rev 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009).md); but lest they should drop
these, or have them snatched out of their hands, they are here engraven
upon the posts of the temple as perpetual monuments of their honour.
Thanks be to God, who always causes us to triumph. Nay, believers shall
themselves be made pillars in the temple of our God, and shall go no
more out, and shall have his name engraven on them, which will be their
brightest ornament and honour, [Rev
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012). (10..md) Notice is here taken of
the pavement of the court, [Eze 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#017.md),
[Eze 40:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#018.md). The word intimates that
the pavement was made of porphyry-stone, which was of the colour of
burning coals; for the brightest and most sparkling glories of this
world should be put and kept under our feet when we draw near to God and
are attending upon him. The stars are, as it were, the burning coals, or
stones of a fiery colour, with which the pavement of God's celestial
temple is laid; and, if the pavement of the court be so bright and
glittering, how glorious must we conclude the mansions of that house to
be!

2\. The gates that looked towards the north ([Eze
40:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#020).md) and towards the south ([Eze
40:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#024).md), with their appurtenances, are
much the same with that towards the east, after the measure of the first
gate, [Eze 40:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#021.md). But the description
is repeated very particularly. And thus largely was the structure of the
tabernacle related in Exodus, and of the temple in the books of Kings
and Chronicles, to signify the special notice God does take, and his
ministers should take, of all that belong to his church. His delight is
in them; his eye is upon them. He knows all that are his, all his living
temples and all that belongs to them. Observe, (1.) This temple had not
only a gate towards the east, to let into it the children of the east,
that were famous for their wealth and wisdom, but it had a gate to the
north, and another to the south, for the admission of the poorer and
less civilized nations. The new Jerusalem has twelve gates, three
towards each quarter of the world ([Rev
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#013).md); for many shall come from all
parts to sit down there, [Mat 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#011.md).
(2.) To those gates they went up by steps, seven steps ([Eze
40:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#022).md), which, as some observe, may
remind us of the necessity of advancing in grace and holiness, adding
one grace to another, going from step to step, from strength to
strength, still pressing forward towards perfection - upward, upward,
towards heaven, the temple above.

[Ezekiel 40:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 40:27</span></span>

In these verses we have a delineation of the inner court. The survey of
the outer court ended with the south side of it. This of the inner court
begins with the south side ([Eze
40:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#027).md), proceeds to the east ([Eze
40:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#032).md), and so to the north ([Eze
40:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#035).md); for here is no gate either of
the outer or inner court towards the west. It should seem that in
Solomon's temple there were gates westward, for we find porters towards
the west, [Ch1 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#024.md); [Ch1
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#008.md). But Josephus says that in the
second temple there was no gate on the west side. Observe, 1. These
gates into the inner court were exactly uniform with those into the
outer court, the dimensions the same, the chambers adjoining the same,
the galleries or rows round the court the same, and the very engravings
on the posts the same. The work of grace, and its workings, are the
same, for substance, in grown Christians that they are in young
beginners, only that the former have got so much nearer their
perfection. The faith of all the saints is alike precious, though it be
not alike strong. There is a great resemblance between one child of God
and another; for all they are brethren and bear the same image. 2. The
ascent into the outer court at each gate was by seven steps, but the
ascent into the inner court at each gate was by eight steps. This is
expressly taken notice of ([Eze 40:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#031.md),
[Eze 40:34](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#034.md), [Eze
40:37](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#037).md), to signify that the nearer we
approach to God the more we should rise above this world and the things
of it. The people, who worshipped in the outer court, must rise seven
steps above other people, but the priests, who attended in the inner
court, must rise eight steps above them, must exceed them at least one
step more than they exceed other people.

[Ezekiel 40:39](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">eze 40:39</span></span>

In these verses we have an account,

I. Of the tables that were in the porch of the gates of the inner court.
We find no description of the altars of burnt-offerings in the midst of
that court till [Eze 43:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#013.md). But,
because the one altar under the law was to be exchanged for a multitude
of tables under the gospel, here is early notice taken of the tables, at
our entrance into the inner court; for till we come to partake of the
table of the Lord we are but professors at large; our admission to that
is our entrance into the inner court. But in this gospel-temple we meet
with no altar till after the glory of the Lord has taken possession of
it, for Christ is our altar, that sanctifies every gift. Here were eight
tables provided, whereon to slay the sacrifices, [Eze
40:41](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#041.md). We read not of any tables for
this purpose either in the tabernacle or in Solomon's temple. But here
they are provided, to intimate the multitude of spiritual sacrifices
that should be brought to God's house in gospel-times, and the multitude
of hands that should be employed in offering up those sacrifices. Here
were the shambles for the altar; here were the dressers on which they
laid the flesh of the sacrifice, the knives with which they cut it up,
and the hooks on which they hung it up, that it might be ready to be
offered on the altar ([Eze 40:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#043).md), and
there also they washed the burnt-offerings ([Eze
40:38](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#038).md), to intimate that before we
draw near to God's altar we must have every thing in readiness, must
wash our hands, our hearts, those spiritual sacrifices, and so compass
God's altar.

II\. The use that some of the chambers mentioned before were put to. 1.
Some were for the singers, [Eze 40:44](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#044.md).
It should seem they were first provided for before any other that
attended this temple-service, to intimate, not only that the singing of
psalms should still continue a gospel-ordinance, but that the gospel
should furnish all that embrace it with abundant matter for joy and
praise, and give them occasion to break forth into singing, which is
often foretold concerning gospel times, [Psa
96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md); [Psa
98:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001.md). Christians should be singers.
Blessed are those that dwell in God's house, they will be still praising
him. 2. Others of them were for the priests, both those that kept the
charge of the house, to cleanse it, and to see that none came into it to
pollute it, and to keep it in good repair ([Eze
40:45](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#045).md), and those that kept the charge
of the altar ([Eze 40:46](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#046).md), that came
near to the Lord to minister to him. God will find convenient lodging
for all his servants. Those that do the work of his house shall enjoy
the comforts of it.

III\. Of the inner court, the court of the priests, which was fifty
yards square, [Eze 40:47](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#047.md). The altar
that was before the house was placed in the midst of this court,
over-against the three gates, and, standing in a direct line with the
three gates of the outer court, when the gates were set open all the
people in the outer court might through them be spectators of the
service done at the altar. Christ is both our altar and our sacrifice,
to whom we must look with an eye of faith in all our approaches to God,
and he is salvation in the midst of the earth ([Psa
74:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#012).md), to be looked unto from all
quarters.

IV\. Of the porch of the house. The temple is called the house,
emphatically, as if no other house were worthy to be called so. Before
this house there was a porch, to teach us not to rush hastily and
inconsiderately into the presence of God, but gradually, that is,
gravely, and with solemnity, passing first through the outer court, then
the inner, then the porch, ere we enter into the house. Between this
porch and the altar was a place where the priests used to pray, [Joe
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#017.md). In the porch, besides the posts
on which the doors were hung, there were pillars, probably for state and
ornament, like Jachin and Boaz - He will establish; in him is strength,
[Eze 40:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#049.md). In the gospel church every
thing is strong and firm, and every thing ought to be kept in its place
and to be done decently and in order.

[Ezekiel 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#001.md)

We have here a very short and ready way taken for the dividing of the
land among the twelve tribes, not so tedious and so far about as the way
that was taken in Joshua's time; for in the distribution of spiritual
and heavenly blessings there is not that danger of murmuring and
quarrelling that there is in the participation of the temporal
blessings. When God gave to the labourers every one his penny those that
were uneasy at it were soon put to silence with, May I not do what I
will with my own? And such is the equal distribution here among the
tribes. In this distribution of the land we may observe, 1. That it
differs very much from the division of it in Joshua's time, and agrees
not with the order of their birth, nor with that of their blessing by
Jacob or Moses. Simeon here is not divided in Jacob, nor is Zebulun a
haven of ships, a plain intimation that it is not so much to be
understood literally as spiritually, though the mystery of it is very
much hidden from us. In gospel times old things have passed away;
behold, all things have become new. The Israel of God is cast into a new
method. 2. That the tribe of Dan, which was last provided for in the
first division of Canaan ([Jos 19:40](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#040).md),
is first provided for here, [Eze 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#001.md).
Thus in the gospel the last shall be first, [Mat
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#030.md). God, in the dispensation of his
grace, does not follow the same method that he does in the disposals of
his providence. But Dan had now his portion thereabouts where he had
only one city before, northward, on the border of Damascus, and furthest
of all from the sanctuary, because that tribe had revolted to idolatry.
3. That all the ten tribes that were carried away by the king of
Assyria, as well as the two tribes that were long afterwards carried to
Babylon, have their allotment in this visionary land, which some think
had its accomplishment in the particular persons and families of those
tribes who returned with Judah and Benjamin, of which we find many
instances in Ezra and Nehemiah; and it is probable that there were
returns of many more afterwards at several times, which are not
recorded; and the Jews having Galilee, and other parts, that had been
the possessions of the ten tribes, put into their hands, in common with
them, they enjoyed them. Grotius says, If the ten tribes had repented
and returned to God, as the chief fathers of Judah and Benjamin did, and
the priests and Levites ([Ezr 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#005).md),
they would have fared as those two tribes did, but they forfeited the
benefit of this glorious prophecy by sin. However, we believe it has its
designed accomplishment in the establishment and enlargement of the
gospel church, and the happy settlement of all those who are Israelites
indeed in the sure and sweet enjoyment of the privileges of the new
covenant, in which there is enough for all and enough for each. 4. That
every tribe in this visionary distribution had its particular lot
assigned it by a divine appointment; for it was never the intention of
the gospel to pluck up the hedge of property and lay all in common; it
was in a way of charity, not of legal right, that the first Christians
had all things common ([Act 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#044).md), and
many precepts of the gospel suppose that every man should know his own.
We must not only acknowledge, but acquiesce in, the hand of God
appointing us our lot, and be well pleased with it, believing it fittest
for us. He shall choose our inheritance for us, [Psa
47:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#004.md). 5. That the tribes lay
contiguous. By the border of one tribe was the portion of another, all
in a row, in exact order, so that, like stones in an arch, they fixed,
and strengthened, and wedged in one another. Behold how good and how
pleasant a thing it is for brethren thus to dwell together! It was a
figure of the communion of churches and saints under the
gospel-government; thus, though they are many, yet they are one, and
should hold together in holy love and mutual assistance. 6. That the lot
of Reuben, which before lay at a distance beyond Jordan, now lies next
to Judah, and next but one to the sanctuary; for the scandal he lay
under, for which he was told he should not excel, began by this time to
wear off. What has turned to the reproach of any person or people ought
not to be remembered for ever, but should at length be kindly forgotten.
7. That the sanctuary was in the midst of them. There were seven tribes
to the north of it and the Levites, the prince's, and the city's
portion, with that of five tribes more, to the south of it; so that it
was, as it ought to be, in the heart of the kingdom, that it might
diffuse its benign influences to the whole, and might be the centre of
their unity. The tribes that lay most remote from each other would meet
there in a mutual acquaintance and fellowship. Those of the same parish
or congregation, though dispersed, and having no occasion otherwise to
know each other, yet by meeting statedly to worship God together should
have their hearts knit to each other in holy love. 8. That where the
sanctuary was the priests were: For them, even for the priests, shall
this holy oblation be, [Eze 48:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#010.md). As,
on the one hand, this denotes honour and comfort to ministers, that what
is given for their support and maintenance is reckoned a holy oblation
to the Lord, so it intimates their duty, which is that, since they are
appointed and maintained for the service of the sanctuary, they ought to
attend continually to this very thing, to reside on their cures. Those
that live upon the altar must serve at the altar, not take the wages to
themselves and devolve the work upon others; but how can they serve the
altar, his altar they live upon, if they do not live near it? 9. Those
priests had the priests' share of these lands that had approved
themselves faithful to God in times of trial ([Eze
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#011).md): It shall be for the sons of
Zadok, who, it seems, had signalized themselves in some critical
juncture, and went not astray when the children of Israel, and the other
Levites, went astray. God will put honour upon those who keep their
integrity in times of general apostasy, and he has special favours in
reserve for them. Those are swimming upwards, and so they will find at
last, that are swimming against the stream. 10. The land which was
appropriated to the ministers of the sanctuary might by no means be
alienated. It was in the nature of the first-fruits of the land, and was
therefore holy to the Lord; and, though the priests and Levites had both
the use of it and the inheritance of it to them and their heirs, yet
they might not sell it nor exchange it, [Eze
48:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#014.md). It is sacrilege to convert that
to other uses which is dedicated to God. 11. The land allotted for the
city and its suburbs is called a profane place ([Eze
48:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#015).md), or common; not but that the
city was a holy city above other cities, for the Lord was there, but, in
comparison with the sanctuary, it was a profane place. Yet it is too
often true in the worst sense that great cities, even those which, like
this, have the sanctuary near them, are profane places, and it ought to
be deeply lamented. It was the complaint of old, From Jerusalem has
profaneness gone forth into all the land, [Jer
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#015.md). 12. The city is made to be
exactly square, and the suburbs extending themselves equally on all
sides, as the Levites' cities did in the first division of the land
([Eze 48:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#016.md), [Eze
48:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#017).md), which, never being literally
fulfilled in any city, intimates that it is to be understood spiritually
of the beauty and stability of the gospel church, that city of the
living God, which is formed according to the wisdom and counsel of God,
and is made firm and immovable by his promise. 13. Whereas, before, the
inhabitants of Jerusalem were principally of Judah and Benjamin, in
whose tribe it lay, now the head city lies not in the particular lot of
any of the tribes, but those that serve the city, and bear office in it,
shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel, [Eze
48:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#019.md). The most eminent men must be
picked out of all the tribes of Israel for the service of the city,
because many eyes were upon it, and there was great resort to it from
all parts of the nation and from other nations. Those that live in the
city are said to serve the city, for, wherever we are, we must study to
be serviceable to the place, some way or other, according as our
capacity is. They must not come out of the tribes of Israel to the city
to take their ease, and enjoy their pleasures, but to serve the city, to
do all the good they can there, and in so doing they would have a good
influence upon the country too. 14. Care was taken that those who
applied themselves to public business in the city, as well as in the
sanctuary, should have an honourable comfortable maintenance; lands are
appointed, the increase whereof shall be food unto those that serve the
city, [Eze 48:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#018.md). Who goes a warfare
at his own charges? Magistrates, that attend the service of the state,
as well as ministers, that attend the service of the church, should have
all due encouragement and support in so doing; and for this cause pay we
tribute also. 15. The prince had a lot for himself, suited to the
dignity of his high station ([Eze
48:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#021).md); we took an account of it
before, ch. 45. He was seated near the sanctuary, where the testimony of
Israel was, and near the city, where the thrones of judgment were, that
he might be a protection to both and might see the that duty of both was
carefully and faithfully done; and herein he was a minister of God for
good to the whole community. Christ is the church's prince, that defends
it on every side, and creates a defense; nay, he is himself a defence
upon all its glory and encompasses it with his favour. 16. As Judah had
his lot next the sanctuary on one side, so Benjamin had, of all the
tribes, his lot nearest to it on the other side, which honour was
reserved for those who adhered to the house of David and the temple at
Jerusalem when the other ten tribes went astray from both. It is enough
if treachery and apostasy, upon repentance, he pardoned, but constancy
and fidelity shall be rewarded and preferred.
