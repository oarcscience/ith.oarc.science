### [Nehemiah Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">neh 9:0</span></span>

The tenth day of the seventh month between the feast of trumpets ([Neh
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#002).md) and the feast of tabernacles
([Neh 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#014).md) was appointed to be the
day of atonement; we have no reason to think but that it was religiously
observed, though it is not mentioned. But here we have an account of an
occasional fast that was kept a fortnight after that, with reference to
the present posture of their affairs, and it was, as that, a day of
humiliation. There is a time to weep as well as a time to laugh. We have
here an account. I. How this fast was observed ([Neh
9:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#001).md). II. What were the heads of the
prayer that was made to God on that occasion, wherein they made a
thankful acknowledgment of God's mercies, a penitent confession of sin,
and a humble submission to the righteous hand of God in the judgments
that were brought upon them, concluding with a solemn resolution of new
obedience (v. 4-38).

[Nehemiah 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 9:1</span></span>

We have here a general account of a public fast which the children of
Israel kept, probably by order from Nehemiah, by and with the advice and
consent of the chief of the fathers. It was a fast that men appointed,
but such a fast as God had chosen; for, 1. It was a day to afflict the
soul, [Isa 58:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#005.md). Probably they
assembled in the courts of the temple, and they there appeared in
sackcloth and in the posture of mourners, with earth on their heads,
[Neh 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#001.md). By these outward expressions
of sorrow and humiliation they gave glory to God, took shame to
themselves, and stirred up one another to repentance. They were
restrained from weeping, [Neh 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#009.md), but
now they were directed to weep. The joy of our holy feasts must give way
to the sorrow of our solemn fasts when they come. Every thing is
beautiful in its season. 2. It was a day to loose the bands of
wickedness, and that is the fast that God has chosen, [Isa
58:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#006.md). Without this, spreading
sackcloth and ashes under us is but a jest. The seed of Israel, because
they were a holy seed, appropriated to God and more excellent than their
neighbours, separated themselves from all strangers with whom they had
mingled and joined in affinity, [Neh
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#002.md). Ezra had separated them from
their strange wives some years before, but they had relapsed into the
same sin, and had either made marriages or at least made friendships
with them, and contracted such an intimacy as was a snare to them. But
now they separated themselves from the strange children as well as from
the strange wives. Those that intend by prayers and covenants to join
themselves to God must separate themselves from sin and sinners; for
what communion hath light with darkness? 3. It was a day of communion
with God. They fasted to him, even to him ([Zac
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#005)); for, (1..md) They spoke to him in
prayer, offered their pious and devout affections to him in the
confession of sin and the adoration of him as the Lord and their God.
Fasting without prayer is a body without a soul, a worthless carcase.
(2.) They heard him speaking to them by his word; for they read in the
book of the law, which is very proper on fasting days, that, in the
glass of the law, we may see our deformities and defilements, and know
what to acknowledge and what to amend. The word will direct and quicken
prayer, for by it the Spirit helps our praying infirmities. Observe how
the time was equally divided between these two. Three hours (for that is
the fourth part of a day) they spent in reading, expounding, and
applying the scriptures, and three hours in confessing sin and praying;
so that they staid together six hours, and spent all the time in the
solemn acts of religion, without saying, Behold, what a weariness is it!
The varying of the exercises made it the less tedious, and, as the word
they read would furnish them with matter for prayer, so prayer would
make the word the more profitable. Bishop Patrick thinks that they spent
the whole twelve hours of the day in devotion, that from six o'clock in
the morning till nine they read, and then from nine to twelve they
prayed, from twelve to three they read again, and from three till six at
night they prayed again. The word of a fast day is good work, and
therefore we should endeavour to make a day's work, a good day's work,
of it.

[Nehemiah 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 9:4</span></span>

We have here an account how the work of this fast-day was carried on. 1.
The names of the ministers that were employed. They are twice named
([Neh 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#004.md), [Neh
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#005).md), only with some variation of the
names. Either they prayed successively, according to that rule which the
apostle gives ([Co1 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#031.md), You may all
prophesy one by one), or, as some think, there were eight several
congregations at some distance from each other, and each had a Levite to
preside in it. 2. The work itself in which they employed themselves.
(1.) They prayed to God, cried to him with a loud voice ([Neh
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#004).md), for the pardon of the sins of
Israel and God's favour to them. They cried aloud, not that God might
the better hear them, as Baal's worshippers, but that the people might,
and to excite their fervency. (2.) They praised God; for the work of
praise is not unseasonable on a fast-day; in all acts of devotion we
must aim at this, to give unto God the glory due to his name. The
summary of their prayers we have here upon record; whether drawn up
before, as a directory to the Levites what to enlarge on, or recollected
after, as the heads of what they had in prayer enlarged upon, is
uncertain. Much more no doubt was said than is here recorded, else
confessing and worshipping God would not have taken up a fourth part of
the day, much less two-fourths.

In this solemn address to God we have,

I. An awful adoration of God, as a perfect and glorious Being, and the
fountain of all beings, [Neh 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#005.md), [Neh
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#006.md). The congregation is called upon
to signify their concurrence herewith by standing up; and so the
minister directs himself to God, Blessed be thy glorious name. God is
here adored, 1. As the only living and true God: Thou art Jehovah alone,
self-existent and independent; there is no God besides thee. 2. As the
Creator of all things: Thou hast made heaven, earth, and seas, and all
that is in them. The first article of our creed is fitly made the first
article of our praises. 3. As the great Protector of the whole creation:
"Thou preservest in being all the creatures thou hast given being to."
God's providence extends itself to the highest beings, for they need it,
and to the meanest, for they are not slighted by it. What God has made
he will preserve; what he does is done effectually, [Ecc
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#014.md). 4. As the object of the
creatures' praises: "The host of heaven, the world of holy angels,
worshippeth thee, [Neh 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#006.md). But thy
name is exalted above all blessing and praise; it needs not the praises
of the creatures, nor is any addition made to its glory by those
praises." The best performances in the praising of God's name, even
those of the angels themselves, fall infinitely short of what it
deserves. It is not only exalted above our blessing, but above all
blessing. Put all the praises of heaven and earth together, and the
thousandth part is not said of what might and should be said of the
glory of God. Our goodness extendeth not to him.

II\. A thankful acknowledgment of God's favours to Israel.

1\. Many of these are here reckoned up in order before him, and very
much to the purpose, for, (1.) We must take all occasions to mention the
loving kindness of the Lord, and in every prayer give thanks. (2.) When
we are confessing our sins it is good to take notice of the mercies of
God as the aggravations of our sins, that we may be the more humbled and
ashamed, and call ourselves by the scandalous name of ungrateful. (3.)
When we are seeking to God for mercy and relief in the time of distress
it is an encouragement to our faith and hope to look back upon our own
and our fathers' experiences: "Lord, thou hast done well for us
formerly; shall it be all undone again? Art not thou the same God
still?"

2\. Let us briefly observe the particular instances of God's goodness to
Israel here recounted. (1.) The call of Abraham, [Neh
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#007.md). God's favour to him was
distinguishing: "Thou didst choose him." His grace in him was powerful
to bring him out of Ur of the Chaldees, and, in giving him the name of
Abraham, he put honour upon him as his own and assured him that he
should be the father of many nations. Look unto Abraham your father
([Isa 51:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#002).md) and see free grace
glorified in him. (2.) The covenant God made with him to give the land
of Canaan to him and his seed, a type of the better country, [Neh
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#008.md). And this covenant was sure, for
God found Abraham's heart faithful before God, and found it so because
he made it so (for faith is not of ourselves, it is the gift of God),
and therefore performed his words; for with the upright he will show
himself upright, and wherever he finds a faithful heart he will be found
a faithful God. (3.) The deliverance of Israel out of Egypt, [Neh
9:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#009.md). It was seasonable to remember
this now that they were interceding for the perfecting of their
deliverance out of Babylon. They were then delivered, in compassion to
their affliction, in answer to their cry, and in resistance of the pride
and insolence of their persecutors. Wherein they dealt proudly, God
showed himself above them ([Exo
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#011).md), and so got himself a name; for
he said, I will get me honour upon Pharaoh. Even to this day the name of
God is glorified for that wonderful work. It was done miraculously:
signs and wonders were shown for the effecting of it; their deliverance
was the destruction of their enemies; they were thrown into the deeps,
as irrecoverably as a stone into the mighty waters. (4.) The conducting
of them through the wilderness, by the pillar of cloud and fire, which
showed them which way they should go, when they should remove, and when
and where they should rest, directed all their stages and all their
steps, [Neh 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#012.md). It was also a
visible token of God's presence with them, to guide and guard them. They
mention this again ([Neh 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#019).md),
observing that though they had by their sins provoked God to withdraw
from them, and leave them to wander and perish in the by-paths of the
wilderness, yet in his manifold mercy he continued to lead them, and
took not away the pillar of cloud and fire, [Neh
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#019.md). When mercies, though forfeited,
are continued, we are bound to be doubly thankful. (5.) The plentiful
provision made for them in the wilderness, that they might not perish
for hunger: Thou gavest them bread from heaven, and water out of the
rock ([Neh 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#015).md), and, to hold up
their hearts, a promise that they should go in and possess the land of
Canaan. They had meat and drink, food convenient in the way, and the
good land at their journey's end; what would they more? This also is
repeated ([Neh 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#020.md), [Neh
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#021).md) as that which was continued,
notwithstanding their provocations: Forty years didst thou sustain them.
Never was people so long nursed and so tenderly; they were wonderfully
provided for, and, in so long a time, their clothes waxed not old, and,
though the way was rough and tedious, their feet swelled not; for they
were carried as upon eagles' wings. (6.) The giving of the law upon
Mount Sinai. This was the greatest favour of all that was done them and
the greatest honour that was put upon them. The Lawgiver was very
glorious, [Neh 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#013.md). "Thou didst not
only send, but camest down thyself, and didst speak with them," [Deu
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#033.md). The law given was very good. No
nation under the sun had such right judgments, true laws, and good
statutes, [Deu 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#008.md). The moral and
judicial precepts were true and right, founded upon natural equity and
the eternal reasons of good and evil; and even the ceremonial
institutions were good, tokens of God's goodness to them and types of
gospel grace. Particular notice is taken of the law of the fourth
commandment as a great favour to them: Thou madest known unto them thy
holy sabbath, which was a token of God's particular favour to them,
distinguishing them from the nations who had revolted from God and quite
lost that ancient part of revealed religion, and was likewise a means of
keeping up their communion with him. And, with the law and the sabbath,
he gave his good Spirit to instruct them, [Neh
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#020.md). Besides the law given on Mount
Sinai, the five books of Moses, which he wrote as he was moved by the
Holy Ghost, were constant instructions to them, particularly the book of
Deuteronomy, in which God's Spirit by Moses instructed them fully.
Bezaleel was filled with the Spirit of God ([Exo
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#003).md), so was Joshua ([Num
27:18](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#018).md), and Caleb had another spirit.
(7.) The putting of them in possession of Canaan, that good land,
kingdoms and nations, [Neh 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#022.md). They
were made so numerous as to replenish it ([Neh
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#023).md) and so victorious as to be
masters of it ([Neh 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#024).md); the natives
were given into their hands, that they might do with them as they would,
set their feet, if they pleased, on the necks of their kings. Thus they
gained a happy settlement, [Neh 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#025.md).
Look upon their cities, and you see them strong and well fortified. Look
into their houses, and you find them fine and well furnished, filled
with all sorts of rich goods. Take a view of the country, and you will
say that you never saw such a fat land, so well stored with vineyards
and oliveyards. All these they found made ready to their hands; so they
delighted themselves in the gifts of God's great goodness. They could
not wish to be more easy or happy than they were, or might have been, in
Canaan, had it not been their own fault. (8.) God's great readiness to
pardon their sins, and work deliverance for them, when they had by their
provocations brought his judgments upon themselves. When they were in
the wilderness they found him a God ready to pardon ([Neh
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#017).md), a God of pardons (so the margin
reads it), who had proclaimed his name as a God forgiving iniquity,
transgression, and sin, who has power to forgive sin, is willing to
forgive, and glories in forgiving. Though they forsook him, he did not
forsake them, as justly he might have done, but continued his care of
them and favour to them. Afterwards, when they were settled in Canaan
and sold themselves by their sins into the hands of their enemies, upon
their submission and humble request he gave them saviours ([Neh
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#027).md), the judges, by whom God wrought
many a great deliverance for them when they were on the brink of ruin.
This he did, not for any merit of theirs, for their deserved nothing but
ill, but according to his mercies, his manifold mercies. (9.) The
admonitions and fair warnings he gave them by his servants the prophets.
When he delivered them from their troubles he testified against their
sins ([Neh 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#028.md), [Neh
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#029).md), that they might not misconstrue
their deliverances as connivances at their wickedness. That which was
designed in all the testimonies which the prophets bore against them was
to bring them again to God's law, to lay their necks under its yoke, and
walk by its rule. The end of our ministry is to bring people to God by
bringing them to his law, not to bring them to ourselves by bringing
them under any law of ours. This we have again ([Neh
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#030).md): Thou testifiedst against them
by thy Spirit in thy prophets. The testimony of the prophets was the
testimony of the Spirit in the prophets, and it was the Spirit of Christ
in them, [Pe1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010.md), [Pe1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011.md). They spoke as they were moved by
the Holy Ghost, and what they said is to be received accordingly. God
gave them his Spirit to instruct them ([Neh
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#020).md), but, they not receiving that
instruction, he did by his Spirit testify against them. If we will not
suffer God's word to teach and rule us, it will accuse and judge us. God
sends prophets, in compassion to his people ([Ch2
36:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#015).md), that he may not send
judgments. (10.) The lengthening out of his patience and the moderating
of his rebukes: Many years did he forbear them ([Neh
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#030).md), as loth to punish them, and
waiting to see if they would repent; and, when he did punish them, he
did not utterly consume them nor forsake them, [Neh
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#031.md). Had he forsaken them they would
have been utterly consumed; but he did not stir up all his wrath, for he
designed their reformation, not their destruction. Thus do they
multiply, thus do they magnify, the instances of God's goodness to
Israel, and we should do in like manner, that the goodness of God, duly
considered by us, may lead us to repentance, and overcome our badness.
The more thankful we are for God's mercies the more humbled we shall be
for our own sins.

III\. Here is a penitent confession of sin, their own sins, and the sins
of their fathers. The mention of these is interwoven with the memorials
of God's favours, that God's goodness, notwithstanding their
provocations, might appear the more illustrious, and their sins,
notwithstanding his favours, might appear the more heinous. Many
passages in this acknowledgment of sins and mercies are taken from Eze.
20:5-26, as will appear by comparing those verses with these; for the
word of God is of use to direct us in prayer, and by what he says to us
we may learn what to say to him.

1\. They begin with the sins of Israel in the wilderness: They, even our
fathers (so it might better be read), dealt proudly (though, considering
what they were, and how lately they had come out of slavery, they had no
reason to be proud), and hardened their necks, [Neh
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#016.md). Pride is at the bottom of men's
obstinacy and disobedience; they think it below them to bow their necks
to God's yoke, and a piece of state to set up their own will in
opposition to the will of God himself. (1.) There were two things which
they did not duly give heed to, else they would not have done as they
did: - The word of God they heard, but they did not hearken to God's
commandments; and the works of God they saw, but they were not mindful
of his wonders: had they duly considered them as miracles, they would
have obeyed from a principle of faith and holy fear; had they duly
considered them as mercies, they would have obeyed from a principle of
gratitude and holy love. But, when men make no right use either of God's
ordinances or of his providences, what can be expected from them? (2.)
Two great sins are here specified; which they were guilty of in the
wilderness - meditating a return, \[1.\] To Egyptian slavery, which, for
the sake of the garlick and onions, they preferred before the glorious
liberty of the Israel of God attended with some difficulty and
inconvenience. In their rebellion they appointed a captain to return to
their bondage, in distrust of God's power and contempt of his holy
promise, [Neh 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#017.md). \[2.\] To Egyptian
idolatry: They made a molten calf, and were so sottish as to say, This
is thy God.

2\. They next bewail the provocations of their fathers after they were
put in possession of Canaan. Though they were delighted themselves in
God's great goodness, yet that would not prevail to keep them closely to
him; for, nevertheless, they were disobedient ([Neh
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#026).md) and wrought great provocations.
For, (1.) They abused God's prophets, slew them because they testified
against them to turn them to God ([Neh
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#026).md), so returning the greatest
injury for the greatest kindness. (2.) They abused his favours: After
they had rest, they did evil again, [Neh
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#028.md). They were not wrought upon
either by their troubles or their deliverances out of trouble. Neither
fear nor love would hold them to their duty.

3\. They at length come nearer to their own day, and lament the sins
which had brought those judgments upon them which they had long been
groaning under and were now but in part delivered from: We have done
wickedly ([Neh 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#033).md): our kings, our
princes, our priests, and our fathers, have all been guilty, and we in
them, [Neh 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#034.md). Two things they
charge upon themselves and their fathers, as the cause of their
troubles: - (1.) A contempt of the good law God had given them: They
sinned against thy judgments, the dictates of divine wisdom, and the
demands of divine sovereignty. Though they were told how much it would
be for their own advantage to govern themselves by them, for, if a man
do them, he shall live in them ([Neh
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#029).md), yet they would not do them, and
so, in effect, said that they would not live. They forsook their own
mercies. This abridgment of the covenant, Do this and live, is taken
from [Eze 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#013.md), and is quoted, [Gal
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#012.md), to prove that the law is not of
faith; it was not them as it is now, Believe and live, yet they gave a
withdrawing shoulder, so it is in the margin. They pretended to lay
their shoulders under the burden of God's law, and put their shoulders
to the work, but they proved withdrawing shoulders; they soon flew off,
would not keep to it, would not abide by it. When it came, as we say, to
the setting to, they shrunk back, and would not hear. They had a
backsliding heart; and, though God by his prophets called them to
return, they would not give ear, [Neh
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#030.md). He stretched out his hands, but
no man regarded. (2.) A contempt of the good land god had given them
([Neh 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#035).md): "Our kings have not
served thee in their kingdom, have not used their power for the support
of religion; our people have not served thee in the use of the gifts of
thy great goodness, and in that large and fat land which thou not only
gavest them by thy grant, but gavest before them by the expulsion of the
natives and the complete victories they obtained over them." Those that
would not serve God in their own land were made to serve their enemies
in a strange land, as was threatened, [Deu
28:47](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#047.md), [Deu
28:48](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#048.md). It is a pity that a good land
should have bad inhabitants, but so it was with Sodom. Fatness and
fulness often make men proud and sensual.

IV\. Here is a humble representation of the judgments of God, which they
had been and were now under.

1\. Former judgments are remembered as aggravations of their sins, that
they had not taken warning. In the days of the judges their enemies
vexed them ([Neh 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#027).md); and, when they
did evil again, God did again leave them in the hand of their enemies,
who could not have touched them if God had not given them up; but, when
God left them, they got and kept dominion over them.

2\. Their present calamitous state is laid before the Lord ([Neh
9:36](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#036.md), [Neh
9:37](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#037).md): We are servants this day.
Free-born Israelites are enslaved, and the land which they had long held
by a much more honourable tenure than grand sergeantry itself, even by
immediate grant from the crown of heaven to them as a peculiar people
above all people on the earth, they now held by as base a tenure as
villenage itself, by, from, and under, the kings of Persia, whose
vassals they were. A sad change! But see what work sin makes! They were
bound to personal service: They have dominion over our bodies; they held
all they had precariously, were tenants at will, and the land-tax that
they paid was so great that it amounted even to a rack-rent; so that all
the rents, issues, and profits, of their land did in effect accrue to
the king, and it was as much as they could do to get a bare subsistence
for themselves and their families out of it. This, they honestly own,
was for their sins. Poverty and slavery are the fruits of sin; it is sin
that brings us into all our distresses.

V. Here is their address to God under these calamities. 1. By way of
request, that their trouble might not seem little, [Neh
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#032.md). It is the only petition in all
this prayer. The trouble was universal; it had come on their kings,
princes, priests, prophets, fathers, and all their people; they had all
shared in the sin ([Neh 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#034).md), and now
all shared in the judgment. It was of long continuance: From the time of
the kings of Assyria, who carried the ten tribes captive, unto this day.
"Lord, let it not all seem little and not worthy to be regarded, or not
needing to be relieved." They do not prescribe to God what he shall do
for them, but leave it to him, only desiring he would please to take
cognizance of it, remembering that when he saw the affliction of his
people in Egypt to be great he came down to deliver them, [Exo
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#007.md), [Exo
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008.md). In this request they have an eye
to God as one that is to be feared (for he is the great, the mighty, and
the terrible, God), and as one that is to be trusted, for he is our God
in covenant, and a God that keeps covenant and mercy. 2. By way of
acknowledgment, notwithstanding, that really it was less than they
deserved, [Neh 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#033.md). They own the
justice of God in all their troubles, that he had done them no wrong.
"We have done wickedly in breaking thy laws, and therefore thou hast
done right in bringing all these miseries upon us." Note, It becomes us,
when we are under the rebukes of divine Providence, though ever so sharp
and ever so long, to justify God and to judge ourselves; for he will be
clear when he judgeth. [Psa 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004.md).

VI\. Here is the result and conclusion of this whole matter. After this
long remonstrance of their case was made they came at last to this
resolution, that they would return to God and to their duty, and oblige
themselves never to forsake God, but always to continue in their duty.
"Because of all this, we make a sure covenant with God; in consideration
of our frequent departures from God, we will now more firmly than ever
bind ourselves to him. Because we have smarted so much for sin, we will
now stedfastly resolve against it, that we may not any more withdraw the
shoulder." Observe, 1. This covenant was made with serious
consideration. It is the result of a chain of suitable thoughts, and so
is a reasonable service. 2. With great solemnity. It was written, in
perpetuam rei memoriam - that it might remain a memorial for all ages;
it was sealed and left upon record, that it might be a witness against
them if they dealt deceitfully. 3. With join consent: "We make it; we
are all agreed in making it, and do it unanimously, that we may
strengthen the hands one of another." 4. With fixed resolution: "It is a
sure covenant, without reserving a power of revocation. It is what we
will live and die by, and never go back from." A certain number of the
princes, priests, and Levites, were chosen as the representatives of the
congregation, to subscribe and seal it for and in the name of the rest.
Now was fulfilled that promise concerning the Jews, that, when they
returned out of captivity, they should join themselves to the Lord in a
perpetual covenant ([Jer 50:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#005).md), and
that in [Isa 44:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#005.md), that they should
subscribe with their hand unto the Lord. He that bears an honest mind
will not startle at assurances; nor will those that know the
deceitfulness of their own hearts think them needless.
