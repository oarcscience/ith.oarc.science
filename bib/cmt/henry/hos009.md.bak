### [Hosea Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#001.md)

[Hosea](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hos 9:0</span></span>

In this chapter, I. God threatens to deprive this degenerate seed of
Israel of all their worldly enjoyments, because by sin they had
forfeited their title to them; so that they should have no comfort
either in receiving them themselves or in offering them to God ([Hos
9:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#001).md). II. He dooms them to utter
ruin, for their own sins and the sins of their prophets ([Hos
9:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006).md). III. He upbraids them with the
wickedness of their fathers before them, whose steps they trod in ([Hos
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#009.md), [Hos
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010).md). IV. He threatens them with the
destruction of their children and the rooting out of their posterity
([Hos 9:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#011).md).

[Hosea 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 9:1</span></span>

Here, I. The people of Israel are charged with spiritual adultery: O
Israel! thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, [Hos
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#001.md). Their covenant with God was a
marriage-covenant, by which they were joined to him as their God,
renouncing all others. But when they set up idols and worshipped them,
when they fled to creatures for succour and put a confidence in them,
they went a whoring from God as their God, and honoured the pretenders
and rivals with the affection, adoration, and confidence, which were due
to God only. Other people were idolaters, but that sin was not, in them,
going a whoring from God, as it was in Israel that had been married to
him. Note, The sins of those who have made a profession of religion and
relation to God are more provoking to him than the sins of others. As a
proof of their going a whoring from God, it is charged upon them that
they loved a reward upon every corn-floor. 1. They loved to give rewards
to their idols, in the offerings and first-fruits they presented to them
out of every corn-floor. They took a strange pleasure in serving their
idols with that which they would have grudged to consecrate to God and
employ in his service. Note, It is common for those that are niggardly
in the expenses of their religion to be very prodigal in spending upon
their lusts. Or, 2. They loved to receive rewards from their idols; and
such they reckoned the fruits of the earth to be: These are my rewards,
which my lovers have given me, [Hos
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#012.md). Note, Those are directly
disposed to spiritual idolatry that love a reward in the corn-floor
better than a reward in the favour of God and eternal life.

II\. They are forbidden to rejoice as other people do: "Rejoice not, O
Israel! for joy. Do not expect to rejoice. What peace, what joy, what
hast thou to do with either, while thy whoredoms and witchcrafts are so
many?" [Kg2 9:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#019.md). Be not disposed
to rejoice, for it does not become thee, but rather to be afflicted, and
mourn, and weep, [Jam 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#009.md). Judah, that
keeps close to the true God, nay, and other people that never knew him
nor could ever be charged with revolting from him, may be allowed to
rejoice, as not having so much cause to be ashamed as Israel has, that
has gone a whoring from him. Some think that they had at this time
particular occasions for joy, probably upon the account of some losses
recovered, or some advantages gained, or some league made with a potent
ally, for which they had public rejoicings, as other people used to have
upon such occasions; but God sends to them not to rejoice. Note, Joy is
forbidden fruit to wicked people. They must not rejoice, because they
have gone a whoring from their God; and therefore, 1. Whatever it was
that they rejoiced in, it would be no security nor advantage to them, so
long as they were at a distance from God and at war with him. Note, We
are likely to have small joy of any of our creature-comforts if we make
not God our chief joy. 2. The sense of sin and dread of wrath ought to
be a damp upon their joy and a strong alloy to all their comforts. Note,
Those who by departing from God have made work for repentance have
thereby marred their own mirth, till they return and make their peace
with God.

III\. They are threatened with destroying judgments for their spiritual
whoredoms, according to what was said long before. [Psa
73:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#027.md), Thou hast destroyed all those
that go a whoring from thee. It is here threatened,

1\. That their land shall not yield its wonted increase. Canaan, that
fruitful land, shall be turned into barrenness for the wickedness of
those that dwell therein. They love the reward in the corn-floor, and
are so full of the joy of harvest that they have no disposition at all
to mourn for their sins; and therefore God will, for their effectual
humiliation, take away from them, not only their delights and dainties,
but even their necessary food ([Hos
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#002).md): The floor and the wine-press
shall not feed them, much less feast them; they shall either be blasted
by the hand of God or plundered by the hand of man. The new wine with
which they used to make merry shall fail in her. Note, When we make the
world, and the things of it, our idol and portion, above what they were
designed for, it is just with God to deny us even support and
nourishment from them, according to that which they were designed for,
to show us our folly and correct us for it. Let those miss of their food
in the corn-floor that look for their reward in the corn-floor. We
forfeit the good things of this world if we love them as the best
things.

2\. That their land shall not only cease to feed them, but cease to
lodge them and to be a habitation for them; it shall spue them out, as
it had done the Canaanites before them ([Hos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003).md): They shall not dwell any longer
in the Lord's land. The land of Canaan was in a peculiar manner the
Lord's land, the land of the Shechinah (so the Chaldee), the land of the
Lord of the world (so the Arabic); he whose all the earth is ([Psa
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001).md) took that for his demesne. The
land is mine, says God, [Lev 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#023.md).
They had used it, or abused it rather, as if it had been their own, had
not paid the rent, nor done the services, due to God as their landlord,
and therefore God justly enters, and takes possession of it, they having
forfeited their lease. "It is my land" (says God) "and I will make it
appear, for they shall be turned off, as bad tenants, and be made to
know that, though they thought themselves freeholders, they were but
tenants at will." Note, It is for the honour of God's justice and
holiness that those who go a whoring from God should not be suffered to
dwell upon his land; and therefore, sooner or later, the wicked shall be
chased out of the world. Or it is called the Lord's land because it was
the holy land, Immanuel's land, the land that had peculiar tokens of
God's favour to it, and presence in it, where God was known and his name
was great, where God's prophets and oracles were; it was a kind of copy
of the earthly paradise, and a type of the heavenly one. It was a great
privilege to have a lot in such a land as this. It was a great sin and
folly to rebel against God, and go a whoring from him, in such a land as
this, to deal unjustly in a land of uprightness, [Isa
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#010.md). And it was a sad and sore
judgment to be driven out from such a land as this; it was like driving
our first parents out of the garden of Eden, and almost amounted to an
exclusion out of the heavenly Canaan. Note, Those cannot expect to dwell
in the Lord's land that will not be subject to the Lord's laws, nor be
influenced by his love. Those have forfeited the privileges of the
church that conform not to the rules of it.

3\. That, when they are turned out from the Lord's land, they shall have
no rest nor satisfaction in any other land. When Cain was driven out
from the presence of the Lord he was a fugitive and a vagabond ever
after, and dwelt in the land of trembling. So Israel here. Some shall
return into Egypt, the old house of bondage; thither they shall flee
from the Assyrian ([Hos 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#013).md) and they
shall lose and ruin themselves where they thought to hide and help
themselves. Others shall be carried captives to Assyria and there shall
be forced to eat unclean things, either (1.) Such things as were not fit
for men to eat, that which is rotten and putrefied, intimating that they
shall be reduced to the utmost poverty, as the prodigal that would fain
have filled his belly with the husks. Or, (2.) Such things as were not
fit for Jews to eat, being prohibited by their law. It is probable that
while they were in their own land, however disobedient in other things,
they kept up the distinction of meats, and prided themselves in that;
but, since they would not keep the law of God in other things, they
should not be suffered to keep it in that, and it was a just punishment
of their sin in eating things offered to idols. Note, When at any time
we suffer in our food, and either through want or for our health are
forced to eat or drink that which is unpleasing, we must acknowledge
that God is righteous, because we have sinned about our food, and have
indulged ourselves too much in that which is pleasing.

4\. That in the land of their enemies, to which they shall be driven,
they shall have no opportunity either of giving honour to God or
obtaining favour with God, by offering any acceptable sacrifice to him;
they should not be in a capacity of keeping up any face or show of
religion among them; "and so" (as Dr. Pocock expresses it) "should be as
it were quite cut off from any expression of relation to him, from all
signs of grace, and means of reconciliation with him, which would be to
them a token of their being rejected of God, estranged from him, and no
more owned by him as his people." (1.) They shall have no sacrifices to
offer, nor any altar to offer them on, nor priests to offer them; they
shall not so much as offer drink-offerings to the Lord, much less any
other sacrifices. (2.) If they should offer them, neither they nor their
sacrifices shall be pleasing to him, for they cannot have any legal
offerings, nor are their hearts humbled. (3.) Instead of their
sacrifices of joy and praise, they shall eat the bread of mourners; they
shall live desolate, and disconsolate, mourning for the death of their
relations and their own miseries, so that if they had opportunity of
sacrificing they should never be themselves in a frame fit for it; for
they were forbidden to eat of the holy things in their mourning, [Deu
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#014.md). All that eat of the bread of
mourners are polluted, and incapacitated to partake of the altar. (4.)
Their bread for their soul, the bread which they must either eat or
starve, the bread which they shall have for the support of their lives,
shall not come into the house of the Lord; they shall have no house of
the Lord to bring it to, or, if they had, it is such as is not fit to be
brought, nor are they rightly disposed to bring it. (5.) The return of
the days of their sacred and solemn feasts would therefore be very
melancholy and uncomfortable to them ([Hos
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#005).md): What will you do in the solemn
day, in the sabbath, the solemn day of every week, in the new moons, the
solemn days of every month, at the return of the times for keeping the
passover, pentecost, and feast of the tabernacles, the solemn days of
every year, the days of the feasts of the Lord? Note, The feasts of the
Lord are solemn days; and, when we are invited to those feasts, we ought
to consider seriously what we shall do. But the question is here put to
those who were to be deprived of the benefit and comfort of those solemn
feasts, "What will you do then? You will then spend those days in sorrow
and lamentation which, if it had not been your own fault, you might have
been spending in joy and praise. You will then be made to know the worth
of mercies by the want of them and to prize spiritual bread by being
made to feel a famine of it." Note, When we enjoy the means of grace we
ought to consider what we shall do if ever we should know the want of
them, if either they should be taken from us or we be disabled to attend
upon them.

5\. That they should perish in the land of their dispersion ([Hos
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006).md): For, lo, they have gone out of
the Lord's land, where they might have spent both their sabbath days and
other days with comfort, gone because of destruction, gone to Egypt
because of the destruction of their own country by the Assyrians,
flattering themselves with hopes that they shall return when the storm
is over; but those hopes also shall fail them; they shall find there are
graves in Egypt, as their murmuring ancestors said ([Exo
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#011).md), graves for them; for Egypt
shall gather them up, as dead men are gathered up and carried forth to
the grave, and Memphis (one of the chief cities of Egypt) shall bury
them. Gathering and burying are put together, [Jer
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#002.md); [Job
27:19](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#019.md). Note, Those that think
presumptuously to flee from the judgments of God are likely enough tp
meet their death where they hoped to save their lives.

6\. That their land, which they left behind and to which they hoped to
return, should become a desolation: As for their tabernacles, where they
formerly dwelt and where they kept their stores, the pleasant places for
their silver, they shall be demolished and laid in ruins, to such a
degree that they shall be overgrown with nettles; so that if they should
survive the trouble, and return to their own land again, they would find
it neither fruitful nor habitable; it would afford them neither food nor
lodging. Note, Those that make their money their god reckon the places
of their silver their pleasant places, as those that make the Lord their
God reckon his tabernacles amiable and his ordinances their pleasant
things, [Isa 64:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#011.md). But, while the
pleasures of communion with God are out of the reach of chance and
change, the pleasant places of men's silver, which were purchased with
silver, or in which they deposited their silver, or which were
beautified and adorned with silver, are liable to be laid in ruins, in
nettles, and therewith all the pleasure men took in them.

[Hosea 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 9:7</span></span>

For their further awakening, it is here threatened,

I. That the destruction spoken of shall come speedily. They shall have
no reason to hope for a long reprieve, for the judgment slumbers not; it
is at the door ([Hos 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007).md): The days of
visitation have come, and there shall be no more delay; the days of
recompence have come, which they have been so often warned to expect;
their prophets have told them that destruction would come, and now it
has come, and the time of the divine patience has expired. Note, 1. The
day of God's judgments is both a day of visitation, in which men's sins
are enquired into and brought to light, and a day of recompence, in
which men's doom will be passed, and a reward given to every man
according to his work; the strict visitation is in order to a just
retribution. 2. This day of visitation and recompence is hastening on
apace. It is sure; it is near; as if it had already come.

II\. That hereby they shall be made ashamed of their sentiments
concerning their prophets. When the day of visitation comes Israel shall
know it, shall be made to know that by sad experience which they would
not know by instruction. Israel shall know then what an evil and bitter
thing it is to depart from God, and what a fearful thing it is to fall
into his hands. When thy hand is lifted up they will not see, but they
shall see. Israel shall know the difference between true prophets and
false. 1. They shall know then that the pretenders to prophecy, who
flattered them in their sins, and rocked them asleep in their security,
and told them that they should have peace though they went on, however
they pretended to be spiritual men (as Ahab's prophets did, [Kg1
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#024).md) were fools and madmen, and not
true prophets; they deceived themselves and those to whom they
prophesied. But why would God suffer his people Israel to be imposed
upon by those false prophets? He answers, "It is for the multitude of
thy iniquity which, in contempt of the divine law, thou hast persisted
in, and, for the great hatred of the true prophets, that reproved thee,
in God's name, for it." Note, Because men receive not the love of the
truth, but conceive a hatred of it, and by the multitude of their
iniquities bid defiance to it, therefore God shall send them strong
delusions, to believe a lie, so strong that they shall not be undeceived
till the day of visitation and recompence comes, which will convince
them of the folly and madness of those that seduced them and of their
own folly and madness in suffering themselves to be seduced by them. 2.
They shall know then whether the true prophets, that were really
spiritual men, guided by the Spirit of God, were such as they called and
counted them, fools and madmen; and they shall be convinced that they
were so far from being so that they were the wise men of their times,
and God's faithful ambassadors to them. When Israel saw that none of
Samuel's words fell to the ground they knew he was established to be a
prophet ([Sa1 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#020).md); and so here, when
God fulfils the word of his messengers, by bringing the days of
recompence they foretold, then those that despised and ridiculed them,
and thought Bedlam the fittest place for them, will be ashamed of the
multitude of their iniquities of that kind, and of their great hatred,
for which God brings upon them this swift destruction. Mocking the
messengers of the Lord was the sin they were punished for, and so made
ashamed of.

III\. That hereby the wickedness of the false prophets themselves shall
be manifested to their shame ([Hos
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#008).md): "The watchman of Ephraim was
with my God; he had been formerly. They had a set of worthy good
ministers, that kept close to God and maintained communion with him; but
now they have a race of corrupt, malignant, persecuting prophets, that
are the ring-leaders of all mischief." Or, "The watchman of Ephraim now
pretends to have been with my God, and prefaces his lies with, Thus
saith the Lord; but he is a snare of a fowler in all his ways, and is
cunning to draw the simple into sin and the upright into trouble; and he
is so full of hatred and enmity to goodness and good men that he has
become hatred itself in the house of his God, or against the house of
his God." Note, Wicked prophets are the worst of men; their sins against
God are most heinous, and their plots against religion most dangerous.
They may boast that they are watchmen, speculators, and, as far as
speculation goes, they may be right, and with my God, may have their
heads full of good notions; but look into their lives, and they are the
snare of a fowler in all their ways, catching for themselves and making
a prey of others; look into their hearts, and they are hatred in the
house of my God, very malicious and spiteful against good ministers and
good people. Woe unto thee, O land! unto thee, O church! that hast such
watchmen, such prophets, that are seers, but not doers! Corruptio optimi
est pessima - The best things, when corrupted, become the worst.

IV\. That God will now reckon with them for the sins of their fathers,
which they have trod in the steps of, [Hos
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#009.md), [Hos
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010.md). 1. They were as bad as their
fathers: They have deeply corrupted themselves; they are rooted and
riveted in sin; they are far gone in the depths of Satan ([Isa
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#006).md), so that it is next to
impossible that they should be recovered; the stain of their corruption
is deep, not to be got out; it is as scarlet and crimson, or as the
spots of the leopard: and it is their own fault; they have corrupted
themselves, have polluted and hardened their own hearts, as in the days
of Gibeah, when the Levite's concubine was abused to death by the men of
Gibeah and the whole tribe of Benjamin patronised the villany; that was
a time of deep corruption indeed, and such were the present days.
Lewdness and wickedness were as impudent and daring now as in the days
of Gibeah; and therefore what can be expected but such a vengeance as
was then taken on Gibeah? Every tribe is now as bad as the tribe of
Benjamin then was, and therefore may expect to be brought as low as that
tribe then was. 2. They shall therefore be reckoned with for their
fathers' sins: He will remember their iniquity and visit their sins, the
iniquity they have by kind and by entail, the sin that runs in the
blood; the sin of the father shall now be visited upon the children.
Hence God takes occasion to upbraid them with the degeneracy and
apostasy of their ancestors, their perfidiousness and base ingratitude,
[Hos 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010). Here observe, (1..md) The
great honour God put upon Israel when he first formed them into a
people: I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness. He took as much
delight and pleasure in them as a poor traveller would do if he found
grapes in a wilderness, where he most needed them and least expected
them. Or when they were in the wilderness he found them as grapes, not
precious in themselves, but precious to him, and pleasant as the
first-ripe grapes to the lord of the vineyard. They were precious in his
sight, and honourable ([Isa 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#004).md); he
planted them a choice vine, a right seed ([Jer
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021).md), and found them no better than
he himself made them, good grapes at first. I saw them with pleasure, as
the first-ripe in the fig-tree at the first time. Good people are
compared to the good things that are first ripe, [Jer
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#002.md). One then is worth more than many
afterwards. This intimates the delight God took in them and in doing
them good, not for their sakes, but because he loved their fathers. He
preserved them carefully, as a man does the first and choicest fruits of
his vineyard. Now when he put all this honour upon them, and they stood
so fair for preferment, one would think they should have maintained
their excellency; but, (2.) See the great disgrace they put upon
themselves. God set them apart for himself as a peculiar people, but
they went to Baal-peor, joined with the Moabites in sacrificing to that
dirty dunghill deity ([Num 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#002.md), [Num
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#003).md), and they separated themselves
unto that shame, that shameful idol, so Baal-peor was in a particular
manner, if (as should seem) the whoredom which the people committed with
the daughters of Moab was a part of the service done to Baal-peor. Note,
Whatever those separate themselves to that forsake God it will certainly
be a shame to them, first or last. Their abominations are here said to
be as they loved; their practices which were an abomination to God were
as the best-beloved of their souls. Or when they had once forsaken God
they multiplied their abominations, their idols and abominable
idolatries, at their pleasure. This was the way of their fathers; God
had done well for them, but they had acted ungratefully towards him, and
in the same manner had the present generation deeply corrupted
themselves.

[Hosea 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 9:11</span></span>

In the foregoing verses we saw the sin of Israel derived from their
fathers; here we see the punishment of Israel derived to their children;
for, as death entered by sin at first, so it is still entailed with it.
We may observe, in these verses,

I. The sin of Ephraim. Some expressions are here which describe that. 1.
They did not hearken to God ([Hos
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#017).md); they did not give attention to
the voice either of his word or of his rod; they did not believe what he
said, nor would they be ruled by him. He told them their duty, their
interest, their danger, but they regarded him not; all he said to them
by his words and by his prophets was to them as a tale that is told; and
then no wonder that we hear, 2. Of the wickedness of their doings ([Hos
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#015).md), the downright malice that was
in their sins; they were not infirmities, but daring presumptions. How
can those but do wickedly who will not hearken to the word of God, that
would teach and persuade them to do well? And no wonder that there were
wicked doings among them when, 3. Their worship was corrupt ([Hos
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#015).md): All their wickedness is in
Gilgal, which was a place infamous for idolatry, as appears, [Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015.md); [Hos
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011.md); [Amo
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#004.md); [Amo
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#005.md). It is probable that the idolaters
chose that place for their head-quarters because it had been famous in
other ages for solemn transactions between God and Israel, as [Jos
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#002.md), [Jos
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#010.md); [Sa1
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#008.md); [Sa1
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#015.md). There, where the source of
idolatry was, whence it spread through the kingdom, there it might be
said that all their wickedness was, for all other wickedness owed its
origin to that. Corruptions in worship make way for corruptions in
morals. The mother of harlots is the mother of all other abominations,
[Rev 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#005.md). The learned Grotius
conjectures that there is a mystical sense here. Golgotha in Syriac is
the same with Gilgal in Hebrew, and therefore he thinks this may have
reference to the putting of Christ to death at Golgotha, which was the
greatest sin of the Jewish nation, and of which it might truly be said,
All their wickedness was summed up in that. And no wonder that the
people did wickedly, both in worship and conversation, when 4. All their
princes were revolters; the whole succession of the kings of the ten
tribes did evil in the sight of the Lord, or all the set of judges and
magistrates at this time were wicked; they turned aside to sinful ways
and persisted in those ways.

II\. The displeasure of God against Ephraim for sin. This is variously
expressed here, to show what a provocation sin is to the pure eyes of
his glory, and how odious it makes the sinner to him. 1. He departs from
them, [Hos 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#012.md). When they revolt from
him, and withdraw from their allegiance to him, how can they expect but
that he should depart from them and withdraw both his protection and his
bounty? And well may his threatening be enforced as it is, and made
terrible: Woe also unto them when I depart from them! Note, Those are in
a woeful condition indeed whom God has forsaken. Our weal or woe depends
upon the gracious presence of God with us; and, if he goes, all weal
goes with him and all woes come upon us. God has forsaken him; persecute
and take him. Saul knew this when he laid such an emphasis upon this
part of his complaint, The Philistines make war against me, and God has
departed from me. Nay, he does not only depart from them, but, 2. He
hates them. In Gilgal, where all their wickedness is, there I hated
them. There, where the abominations of sin are committed, there God
abominates the sinners. In Gilgal he had bestowed many tokens of his
favour upon their ancestors, but now that is the place where he hates
them for their base ingratitude. Nay, he not only hates them, but, 3. He
will love them no more, will never take them into his favour again; the
breach between God and Israel is wide as the sea, which cannot be
healed. This agrees with what he had said, ([Hos
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#006.md), [Hos
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#007).md), I will no more have mercy upon
the house of Israel, the ten tribes. 4. He will discard them, and have
no more to do with them: For the wickedness of their doings, I will
drive them out of my house. He will no longer own them as his, or as
belonging to his family in the world; he will turn them out of doors as
unfaithful tenants that pay him no rent, as unprofitable servants that
do him neither credit nor work. Note, Those that profane God's house can
expect no other than to be expelled his house, and no longer suffered to
be either lodgers in it or retainers to it. Nay, he will not only drive
them out of his house, but, 5. He will drive them far enough ([Hos
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#017).md): My God will cast them away, not
only out of his house, but out of his sight; he will quite abandon and
reject them; they shall be cast-aways. God said that he would drive them
out of his house, and here the prophet seconds it, as one that knew his
Master's mind very well: My God will cast them away. See with what
comfort and pleasure he calls God his God. Note, When others disown God,
and are disowned by him, it is a very great satisfaction to good people
that they can call God their God, can cheerfully own him and see
themselves owned by him - all revolters, all ruined, yet God is my God.

III\. The fruit of this displeasure, in the cutting off and abandoning
of their posterity, which is the judgment here threatened again and
again. Observe here,

1\. How numerous Ephraim seemed likely to be. The name Ephraim is
derived from fruitfulness, [Gen 41:51](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#051.md).
Joseph is a fruitful bough, [Gen
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#022.md). And Moses's blessing foretold
the ten thousands of Ephraim, [Deu
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#017.md). This was his glory, [Hos
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#011.md). For this he seemed designed by
him that appoints the bounds of men's habitation; for Ephraim, as I saw
Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place, to encourage his increase, which
one may expect as from a tree planted by the river's side. Ephraim is as
strong and rich as ever Tyre was, and as proud and secure. The Chaldee
paraphrase gives this sense of it, The congregation of Israel, while
they observed the law, was like to Tyrus in prosperity and security.

2\. How few Ephraim should be ([Hos
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#011).md): Their glory shall fly away like
a bird; their children shall be taken away and the hopes of their
families cut off. All their glory shall fly as an eagle towards heaven,
swiftly and irrecoverably. Note, Worldly glory is glory that will fly
away; but those that have their God their glory have in him an unfading
everlasting glory. Ephraim has been as a fruitful tree. But now Ephraim
is smitten, is blasted; their root is dried up; they shall bear no
fruit, [Hos 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#016.md). If the root be
dried, the branch must wither of course. Observe,

(1.) God's threatening this judgment of the destroying of their
children. \[1.\] They shall perish of themselves by the immediate hand
of God ([Hos 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#011).md): They shall fly
away from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception. Some of
their children shall die as soon as they are born; the cradle shall be
presently turned into a coffin. Others of them shall be still-born, or
the womb shall be their grave, and their death there their mothers'
death too. Of others their mothers shall miscarry almost as soon as they
have conceived, and they shall be as untimely fruit. See how easily God
can, and how justly we are sure he might, root out the whole race of
mankind, that degenerate, guilty, obnoxious race, and blot out the name
of it from under heaven; it is but doing as he does by Ephraim here,
writing them all childless, making all their glory to fly away from the
birth, the womb, and the conception, drying up their root, that they
bear no fruit, and their business is done in a few years. \[2.\] They
shall perish by the hand of their enemies; they shall die violent deaths
([Hos 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#012).md): "Though they bring up
their children to some maturity, though they escape the diseases and
deaths which the infant age is liable to, and are thought to be reared
past danger, yet will I bereave them ([Hos
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#012).md), by one judgment or other, so
that there shall not be a man left to build up their families and bear
up their name." Again ([Hos 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#013).md),
Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer. The mothers
shall travail with pain to bear their children, and a great deal of
care, and pains, and cost shall be bestowed upon the nursing of them,
and when a cruel enemy comes and puts all to the word, young and old,
without mercy, then they seem but as lambs that were all this while fed
for the slaughter. Note, It is a great alloy to the comfort parents have
in their children that they know not what they have brought them forth
and brought them up for, perhaps for the murderer, or, which is worse,
to be themselves the plagues of their generation. It is threatened again
([Hos 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#016).md), Though they bring forth,
yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb, those children
that they are most fond of. Note, The parents' love is no security to
the children's lives; nay, sometimes death is commissioned to take the
darlings of the family and leave the burdens of it. When sentence was
passed upon Israel in the wilderness, that they should all perish there,
this mercy was mixed with the wrath, that their children should
nevertheless enter into that rest which they through unbelief could not
enter into. But this is a total and final rejection; even their children
shall be cut off, and the land shall escheat to the crown, ob defectum
sanguinis - shall be lost for want of heirs. The Chaldee-paraphrase, and
many of the rabbin, by the murderers to whom the children were brought
forth, understand those that sacrificed their children to Moloch, a sin
which was its own punishment, which showed the parents void of bowels
and justly left them void of blessings. \[3.\] Those few that escape and
remain shall be dispersed ([Hos 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#017).md):
They shall be wanderers among the nations; so the remains of the Jews
are at this day, and there is no place in the world where they are a
distinct nation.

(2.) The prophet's prayer relating to it ([Hos
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#014).md): Give them, O Lord! what wilt
thou give? What shall I ask for a people thus doomed to destruction? It
is this; since the decree has gone forth, that they must either die from
the womb or be brought forth for the murderer, of the two let them
rather die from the womb. Rather let them have no children than have
them to be made miserable; for the same reason, when a total ruin was
coming on the Jewish nation, Christ said, Blessed is the womb that never
bore and the paps that never gave suck, [Luk
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#029.md). "Give therefore a miscarrying
womb and dry breasts; for it is better to fall into the hands of the
Lord, whose mercies are great, than into the hands of man." Note, Those
that are childless may with this reconcile themselves to the will of God
herein, that the time may come when, if they were not so, they would
wish they had been so.
