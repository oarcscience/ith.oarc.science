### [Isaiah Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 31:0</span></span>

This chapter is an abridgment of the foregoing chapter; the heads of it
are much the same. Here is, I. A woe to those who, when the Assyrian
army invaded them, trusted to the Egyptians, and not to God, for succour
([Isa 31:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001).md). II. Assurance given of
the care God would take of Jerusalem in that time of danger and distress
([Isa 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#004.md), [Isa
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#005).md). III. A call to repentance and
reformation ([Isa 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#006.md), [Isa
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#007).md). IV. A prediction of the fall of
the Assyrian army, and the fright which the Assyrian king should thereby
be put into ([Isa 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#008.md), [Isa
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#009).md).

[Isaiah 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 31:1</span></span>

This is the last of four chapters together that begin with woe; and they
are all woes to the sinners that were found among the professing people
of God, to the drunkards of Ephraim ([Isa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001).md), to Ariel ([Isa
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001).md), to the rebellious children
([Isa 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#001).md), and here to those that go
down to Egypt for help; for men's relation to the church will not secure
them from divine woes if they live in contempt of divine laws. Observe,

I. What the sin was that is here reproved, [Isa
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001.md). 1. Idolizing the Egyptians, and
making court to them, as if happy were the people that had the Egyptians
for their friends and allies. They go down to Egypt for help in every
exigence, as if the worshippers of false gods had a better interest in
heaven and were more likely to have success of earth than the servants
of the living and true God. That which invited them to Egypt was that
the Egyptians had many chariots to accommodate them with, and horses and
horsemen that were strong; and, if they could get a good body of forces
thence into their service, they would think themselves able to deal with
the king of Assyria and his numerous army. Their kings were forbidden to
multiply horses and chariots, and were told of the folly of trusting to
them ([Psa 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007).md); but they think
themselves wiser than their Bible. 2. Slighting the God of Israel: They
look not to the Holy One of Israel, as if he were not worth taking
notice of in this distress. They advise not with him, seek not his
favour, nor are in any care to make him their friend.

II\. The gross absurdity and folly of this sin. 1. They neglected one
whom, if they would not hope in him, they had reason to fear. They do
not seek the Lord, nor make their application to him, yet he also is
wise, [Isa 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#002.md). They are solicitous
to get the Egyptians into an alliance with them, because they have the
reputation of a politic people; and is not God wise too? and would not
infinite wisdom, engaged on their side, stand them in more stead than
all the policies of Egypt? They are at the pains of going down to Egypt,
a tedious journey, when they might have had better advice, and better
help, by looking up to heaven, and would not. But, if they will not
court God's wisdom to act for them, they shall find it act against them.
He is wise, too wise for them to outwit, and he will bring evil upon
those who thus affront him. He will not call back his words as men do
(because they are fickle and foolish), but he will arise against the
house of the evil-doers, this cabal of them that go down to Egypt; God
will appear to their confusion, according to the word that he has
spoken, and will oppose the help they think to bring in from the workers
of iniquity. Some think the Egyptians made it one condition of their
coming into an alliance with him that they should worship the gods of
Egypt, and they consented to it, and therefore they are both called
evil-doers and workers of iniquity. 2. They trusted to those who were
unable to help them and would soon appear to be so, [Isa
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#003.md). Let them know that the
Egyptians, whom they depend so much upon, are men and not God. As it is
good for men to know themselves to be but men ([Psa
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#020).md), so it is good for us to
consider that those we love and trust to are but men. They therefore can
do nothing without God, nothing against him, nothing in comparison with
him. They are men, and therefore fickle and foolish, mutable and mortal,
here to day and gone to morrow; they are men, and therefore let us not
make gods of them, by making them our hope and confidence, and expecting
that in them which is to be found in God only; they are not God, they
cannot do that for us which God can do, and will, if we trust in him.
Let us not then neglect him, to seek to them; let us not forsake the
rock of ages for broken reeds, nor the fountain of living waters for
broken cisterns. The Egyptians indeed have horses that are very strong;
but they are flesh, and not spirit, and therefore, strong as they are,
they may be wearied with a long march, and become unserviceable, or be
wounded and slain in battle, and leave their riders to be ridden over.
Every one knows this, that the Egyptians are not God and their horses
are not spirit; but those that seek to them for help do not consider it,
else they would not put such confidence in them. Sinners may be
convicted of folly by the plainest and most self-evident truths, which
they cannot deny, but will not believe. 3. They would certainly be
ruined with the Egyptians they trusted in, [Isa
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#003.md). When the Lord does but stretch
out his hand how easily, how effectually, will he make them ashamed of
their confidence in Egypt, and the Egyptians ashamed of the
encouragement they gave them to trust in them; for he that helps and he
that is helped shall fall together, and their mutual alliance shall
prove their joint ruin. The Egyptians were shortly to be reckoned with,
as appears by the burden of Egypt (ch. 19), and then those who fled to
them for shelter and succour should fall with them; for there is no
escaping the judgments of God. Evil pursues sinners, and it is just with
God to make that creature a scourge to us which we make an idol of. 4.
They took God's work out of his hands. They pretended a great deal of
care to preserve Jerusalem, in advising to an alliance with Egypt; and,
when others would not fall in with their measures, they pleaded self
preservation, and went to Egypt themselves. Now the prophet here tells
them that Jerusalem should be preserved without aid from Egypt and that
those who tarried there should be safe when those who fled to Egypt
should be ruined. Jerusalem was under God's protection, and therefore
there was no occasion to put it under the protection of Egypt. But a
practical distrust of God's all-sufficiency is at the bottom of all our
sinful departures from him to the creature. The prophet tells them he
had it from God's own mouth: Thus hath the Lord spoken to me. They might
depend upon it, (1.) That God would appear against Jerusalem's enemies
with the boldness of a lion over his prey, [Isa
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#004.md). When the lion comes out to seize
his prey a multitude of shepherds come out against him; for it becomes
neighbours to help one another when persons or goods are in danger.
These shepherds dare not come near the lion; all they can do is to make
a noise, and with that they think to frighten him off. But does he
regard it? No: he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself
so far as to be in the least moved by it either to quit his prey or to
make any more haste than otherwise he would do in seizing it. Thus will
the Lord of hosts come down to fight for Mount Zion, with such an
unshaken undaunted resolution not to be moved by any opposition; and he
will as easily and irresistibly destroy the Assyrian army as a lion
tears a lamb in pieces. Whoever appear against God, they are but like a
multitude of poor simple shepherds shouting at a lion, who scorns to
take notice of them or so much as to alter his pace for them. Surely
those that have such a protector need not go to Egypt for help. (2.)
That God would appear for Jerusalem's friends with the tenderness of a
bird over her young, [Isa 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#005.md). God
was ready to gather Jerusalem, as a hen gathers her brood under her
wings ([Mat 23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037).md); but those that
trusted to the Egyptians would not be gathered. As birds flying to their
nests with all possible speed, when they see them attacked, and
fluttering about their nests with all possible concern, hovering over
their young ones to protect them and drive away the assailants, with
such compassion and affection will the Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem.
As an eagle stirs up her young when they are in danger, takes them and
bears them on her wings, so the Lord led Israel out of Egypt ([Deu
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011.md), [Deu
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#012).md); and he has now the same tender
concern for them that he had then, so that they need not flee into Egypt
again for shelter. Defending, he will deliver it; he will so defend it
as to secure the continuance of its safety, not defend it for a while
and abandon it at last, but defend it so that it shall not fall into the
enemies' hand. I will defend this city to save it, [Isa
37:35](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#035.md). Passing over he will preserve
it; the word for passing over is used in this sense only here and [Exo
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#012.md), [Exo
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#023.md), [Exo
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#027.md), concerning the destroying
angel's passing over the houses of the Israelites when he slew all the
first-born of the Egyptians, to which story this passage refers. The
Assyrian army was to be routed by a destroying angel, who should pass
over Jerusalem, though that deserved to be destroyed, and draw his sword
only against the besiegers. They shall be slain by the pestilence, but
none of the besieged shall take the infection. Thus he will again pass
over the houses of his people and secure them.

[Isaiah 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 31:6</span></span>

This explains the foregoing promise of the deliverance of Jerusalem; she
shall be fitted for deliverance, and then it shall be wrought for her;
for in that method God delivers.

I. Jerusalem shall be reformed, and so she shall be delivered from her
enemies within her walls, [Isa 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#006.md),
[Isa 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#007.md). Here is, 1. A gracious call
to repentance. This was the Lord's voice crying in the city, the voice
of the rod, the voice of the sword, and the voice of the prophets
interpreting the judgment: "Turn you, O turn you now, from your evil
ways, unto God, return to your allegiance to him from whom the children
of Israel have deeply revolted, from whom you, O children of Israel!
have revolted." He reminds them of their birth and parentage, that they
were children of Israel, and therefore under the highest obligations
imaginable to the God of Israel, as an aggravation of their revolt from
him and as an encouragement to them to return to him. "They have been
backsliding children, yet children; therefore let them return, and their
backslidings shall be healed. They have deeply revolted, with great
address as they supposed (the revolters are profound, [Hos
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#002).md); but the issue will prove that
they have revolted dangerously. The stain of their sins has gone deeply
into their nature, not to be easily got out, like the blackness of the
Ethiopian. They have deeply corrupted themselves ([Hos
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#009).md); they have sunk deep into misery,
and cannot easily recover themselves; therefore you have need to hasten
your return to God." 2. A gracious promise of the good success of this
call ([Isa 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#007).md): In that day every
man shall cast away his idols, in obedience to Hezekiah's orders, which,
till they were alarmed by the Assyrian invasion, many refused to do.
That is a happy fright which frightens us from our sins. (1.) It shall
be a general reformation: every man shall cast away his own idols, shall
begin with them before he undertakes to demolish other people's idols,
which there will be no need of when every man reforms himself. (2.) It
shall be a thorough reformation; for they shall part with their
idolatry, their beloved sin, with their idols of silver and gold, their
idols that they are most fond of. Many make an idol of their silver and
gold, and by the love of that idol are drawn to revolt from God; but
those that turn to God cast that away out of their hearts and will be
ready to part with it when God calls. (3.) It shall be a reformation
upon a right principle, a principle of piety, not of politics. They
shall cast away their idols, because they have been unto them for a sin,
an occasion of sin; therefore they will have nothing to do with them,
though they had been the work of their own hands, and upon that account
they had a particular fondness for them. Sin is the work of our own
hands, but in working it we have been working our own ruin, and
therefore we must cast it away; and those are strangely wedded to it who
will not be prevailed upon to cast it away when they see that otherwise
they themselves will be castaways. Some make this to be only a
prediction that those who trust in idols, when they find they stand them
in no stead, will cast them away in indignation. But it agrees so
exactly with [Isa 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#022.md) that I rather
take it as a promise of a sincere reformation.

II\. Jerusalem's besiegers shall be routed, and so she shall be
delivered from the enemies about her walls. The former makes way for
this. If a people return to God, they may leave it to him to plead their
cause against their enemies. When they have cast away their idols, then
shall the Assyrian fall, [Isa 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#008.md),
[Isa 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#009.md). 1. The army of the
Assyrians shall be laid dead upon the spot by the sword, not of a mighty
man, nor of a mean man, not of any man at all, either Israelite or
Egyptian, not forcibly by the sword of a mighty man nor surreptitiously
by the sword of a mean man, but by the sword of an angel, who strikes
more strongly than a mighty man and yet more secretly than a mean man,
by the sword of the Lord, and his power and wrath in the hand of the
angel. Thus the young men of the army shall melt, and be discomfited,
and become tributaries to death. When God has work to do against the
enemies of his church we expect it must be done by mighty men and mean
men, officers and common soldiers; whereas God can, if he please, do it
without either. He needs not armies of men who has legions of angels at
command, [Mat 26:53](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#053.md). 2. The king of
Assyria shall flee for the same, shall flee from that invisible sword,
hoping to get out of the reach of it; and he shall make the best of his
way to his own dominions, shall pass over to some strong-hold of his
own, for fear lest the Jews should pursue him now that his army was
routed. Sennacherib had been very confident that he should make himself
master of Jerusalem, and in the most insolent manner had set both God
and Hezekiah at defiance; yet now he is made to tremble for fear of
both. God can strike a terror into the proudest of men, and make the
stoutest heart to tremble. See [Job
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#011.md); [Job
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#024.md). His princes that accompany him
shall be afraid of the ensign, shall be in a continual fright at the
remembrance of the ensign in the air, which perhaps the destroying angel
displayed before he gave the fatal bow. Or they shall be afraid of every
ensign they see, suspecting it is a party of the Jews pursuing them. The
banner that God displays for the encouragement of his people ([Psa
60:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#004).md) will be a terror to his and
their enemies. Thus he cuts off the spirit of princes and is terrible to
the kings of the earth. But who will do this? It is the Lord, whose fire
is in Zion and his furnace in Jerusalem. (1.) Whose residence is there,
and who there keeps house, as a man does where his fire and his oven
are. It is the city of the great King, and let not the Assyrians think
to turn him out of the possession of his own house. (2.) Who is there a
consuming fire to all his enemies and will make them as a fiery oven in
the day of his wrath, [Psa 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#009.md). He is
himself a wall of fire round about Jerusalem, so that whoever assaults
her does so at his peril, [Zac 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005.md);
[Rev 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#005). (3..md) Who has his altar
there, on which the holy fire is continually kept burning and sacrifices
are daily offered to his honour, and with which he is well pleased; and
therefore he will defend this city, especially having an eye to the
great sacrifice which was there also to be offered, of which all the
sacrifices were types. If we keep up the fire of holy love and devotion
in our hearts and houses, we may depend upon God to be a protection to
us and them.
