Great service Elisha had done, in he foregoing chapter, for the three
kings: to his prayers and prophecies they owed their lives and triumphs.
One would have expected that the next chapter would tell us what honours
and what dignities were conferred on Elisha for this, that he should
immediately be preferred at court, and made prime-minister of state,
that Jehoshaphat should take him home with him, and advance him in his
kingdom. No, the wise man delivered the army, but no man remembered the
wise man, [Ecc 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#015.md). Or, if he had
preferment offered him, he declined it: he preferred the honour of doing
good in the schools of the prophets before that of being great in the
courts of princes. God magnified him, and that sufficed him - magnified
him indeed, for we have him here employed in working no fewer than five
miracles. I. He multiplied the poor widow's oil ([Kg2
4:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#001).md). II. He obtained for the good
Shunammite the blessing of a son in her old age ([Kg2
4:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#008).md). III. He raised that child to
life when it was dead ([Kg2 4:18-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#018).md).
IV. He healed the deadly pottage ([Kg2
4:38-41](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#038).md). V. He fed 100 men with
twenty small loaves ([Kg2 4:42-44](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#042).md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 4:1</span></span>

Elisha's miracles were for use, not for show; this recorded here was an
act of real charity. Such also were the miracles of Christ, not only
great wonders, but great favours to those for whom they were wrought.
God magnifies his goodness with his power.

I. Elisha readily receives a poor widow's complaint. She was a prophet's
widow; to whom therefore should she apply, but to him that was a father
to the sons of the prophets, and concerned himself in the welfare of
their families? It seems, the prophets had wives as well as the priests,
though prophecy went not by entail, as the priesthood did. Marriage is
honourable in all, and not inconsistent with the most sacred
professions. Now, by the complaint of this poor woman ([Kg2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#001).md), we are given to understand, 1.
That her husband, being one of the sons of the prophets, was well know
to Elisha. Ministers of eminent gifts and stations should make
themselves familiar with those that are every way their inferiors, and
know their character and state. 2. That he had the reputation of a godly
man. Elisha knew him to be one that feared the Lord, else he would have
been unworthy of the honour and unfit for the work of a prophet. He was
one that kept his integrity in a time of general apostasy, one of the
7000 that had not bowed the knee to Baal. 3. That he was dead, though a
good man, a good minister. The prophets - do they live for ever? Those
that were clothed with the Spirit of prophecy were not thereby armed
against the stroke of death. 4. That he died poor, and in debt more than
he was worth. He did not contract his debts by prodigality, and luxury,
and riotous living, for he was one that feared the Lord, and therefore
durst not allow himself in such courses: nay, religion obliges men not
to live above what they have, nor to spend more than what God gives
them, no, not in expenses otherwise lawful; for thereby, of necessity,
they must disable themselves, at last, to give every one his own, and so
prove guilty of a continued act of injustice all along. Yet it may be
the lot of those that fear God to be in debt, and insolvent, through
afflictive providences, losses by sea, or bad debts, or their own
imprudence, for the children of light are not always wise for this
world. Perhaps this prophet was impoverished by persecution: when
Jezebel ruled, prophets had much ado to live, and especially if they had
families. 5. That the creditors were very severe with her Two sons she
had to be the support of her widowed state, and their labour is reckoned
assets in her hand; that must go therefore, and they must be bondmen for
seven years ([Exo 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#002).md) to work out
this debt. Those that leave their families under a load of debt
disproportionable to their estates know not what trouble they entail. In
this distress the poor widow goes to Elisha, in dependence upon the
promise that the seed of the righteous shall not be forsaken. The
generation of the upright may expect help from God's providence and
countenance from his prophets.

II\. He effectually relieves this poor widow's distress, and puts her in
a way both to pay her debt and to maintain herself and her family. He
did not say, Be warmed, be filled, but gave her real help. He did not
give her some small matter for her present provision, but set her up in
the world to sell oil, and put a stock into her hand to begin with. This
was done by miracle, but it is an indication to us what is the best
method of charity, and the greatest kindness one can do to poor people,
which is, if possible, to help them into a way of improving what little
they have by their own industry and ingenuity.

1\. He directed her what to do, considered her case: What shall I do for
thee? The sons of the prophets were poor, and it would signify little to
make a collection for her among them: but the God of the holy prophets
is able to supply all her need; and, if she has a little committed to
her management, her need must be supplied by his blessing and increasing
that little. Elisha therefore enquired what she had to make money of,
and found she had nothing to sell but one pot of oil, [Kg2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#002.md). If she had had any plate or
furniture, he would have bidden her part with it, to enable her to be
just to her creditors. We cannot reckon any thing really, nor
comfortably, our own, but what is so when all our debts are paid. If she
had not had this pot of oil, the divine power could have supplied her;
but, having this, it will work upon this, and so teach us to make the
best of what we have. The prophet, knowing her to have credit among her
neighbours, bids her borrow of them empty vessels ([Kg2
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#003).md), for, it seems, she had sold her
own, towards the satisfying of her creditors. He directs her to shut the
door upon herself and her sons, while she filled all those vessels out
of that one. She must shut the door, to prevent interruptions from the
creditors, and others while it was in the doing, that they might not
seem proudly to boast of this miraculous supply, and that they might
have opportunity for prayer and praise to God upon this extraordinary
occasion. Observe, (1.) The oil was to be multiplied in the pouring, as
the other widow's meal in the spending. The way to increase what we have
is to use it; to him that so hath shall be given. It is not hoarding the
talents, but trading with them, that doubles them. (2.) It must be
poured out by herself, not by Elisha nor by any of the sons of the
prophets, to intimate that it is in connexion with our own careful and
diligent endeavours that we may expect the blessing of God to enrich us
both for this world and the other. What we have will increase best in
our own hand.

2\. She did it accordingly. She did not tell the prophet he designed to
make a fool of her; but firmly believing the divine power and goodness,
and in pure obedience to the prophet, she borrowed vessels large and
many of her neighbours, and poured out her oil into them. One of her
sons was employed to bring her empty vessels, and the other carefully to
set aside those that were full, while they were all amazed to find their
pot, like a fountain of living water, always flowing, and yet always
full. They saw not the spring that supplied it, but believed it to be in
him in whom all our springs are. Job's metaphor was now verified in the
letter ([Job 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#006).md), The rock poured me
out rivers of oil. Perhaps this was in the tribe of Asher, part of whose
blessing it was that he should dip his foot in oil, [Deu
33:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#024.md).

3\. The oil continued flowing as long as she had any empty vessels to
receive it; when every vessel was full the oil stayed ([Kg2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#006).md), for it was not fit that this
precious liquor should run over, and be as water spilt on the ground,
which cannot be gathered up again. Note, We are never straitened in God,
in his power and bounty, and the riches of his grace; all our straitness
is in ourselves. It is our faith that fails, not his promise. He gives
above what we ask: were there more vessels, there is enough in God to
fill them - enough for all, enough for each. Was not this pot of oil
exhausted as long as there were any vessels to be filled from it? And
shall we fear lest the golden oil which flows from the very root and
fatness of the good olive should fail, as long as there are any lamps to
be supplied from it? [Zac 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#012.md).

4\. The prophet directed her what to do with the oil she had, [Kg2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#007.md). She must not keep it for her own
use, to make her face to shine. Those whom Providence has made poor must
be content with poor accommodations for themselves (this is knowing how
to want), and must not think, when they get a little of that which is
better than ordinary, to feed their own luxury: no, (1.) She must sell
the oil to those that were rich, and could afford to bestow it on
themselves. We may suppose, being produced by miracle, it was the best
of its kind, like the wine ([Joh
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#010).md), so that she might have both a
good price and a good market for it. Probably the merchants bought it to
export, for oil was one of the commodities that Israel traded in, [Eze
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#017). (2..md) She must pay her debt with
the money she received for her oil. Though her creditors were too
rigorous with her, yet they must not therefore lose their debt. Her
first care, now that she has wherewithal to do so, must be to discharge
that, even before she makes any provision for her children. It is one of
the fundamental laws of our religion that we render to all their due,
pay every just debt, give every one his own, though we leave ever so
little for ourselves; and this, not of constraint but willingly and
without grudging; not only for wrath, to avoid being sued, but also for
conscience' sake. Those that possess an honest mind cannot with pleasure
eat their daily bread, unless it be their own bread. (3.) The rest must
not be laid up, but she and her children must live upon it, not upon the
oil, but upon the money received from it, with which they must put
themselves into a capacity of getting an honest livelihood. No doubt she
did as the man of God directed; and hence, \[1.\] Let those that are
poor and in distress be encouraged to trust God for supply in the way of
duty. Verily thou shalt be fed, though not feasted. It is true we cannot
now expect miracles, yet we may expect mercies, if we wait on God and
seek to him. Let widows particularly, and prophets' widows in a special
manner, depend upon him to preserve them and their fatherless children
alive, for to them he will be a husband, a father. \[2.\] Let those whom
God has blessed with plenty use it for the glory of God and under the
direction of his word: let them do justly with it, as this widow did,
and serve God cheerfully in the use of it, and as Elisha, be ready to do
good to those that need them, be eyes to the blind, and feet to the
lame.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 4:8</span></span>

The giving of a son to such as were old, and had been long childless,
was an ancient instance of the divine power and favour, in the case of
Abraham, and Isaac, and Manoah, and Elkanah; we find it here among the
wonders wrought by Elisha. This was wrought in recompence for the kind
entertainment which a good woman gave him, as the promise of a son was
given to Abraham when he entertained angels. Observe here,

I. The kindness of the Shunammite woman to Elisha. Things are bad enough
in Israel, yet not so bad but that God's prophet finds friends, wherever
he goes. Shunem was a city in the tribe of Issachar, that lay in the
road between Samaria and Carmel, a road that Elisha often travelled, as
we find [Kg2 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#025.md). There lived a great
woman, who kept a good house, and was very hospitable, her husband
having a good estate, and his heart safely trusting in her, and in her
discreet management, [Pro 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#011.md). So
famous a man as Elisha could not pass and repass unobserved. Probably he
had been accustomed to take some private obscure lodgings in the town;
but this pious matron, having notice once of his being there, pressed
him with great importunity, and, with much difficulty, constrained him
to dine with her, [Kg2 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#008.md). He was
modest and loth to be troublesome, humble and affected not to associate
with those of the first rank; so that it was not without some difficulty
that he was first drawn into an acquaintance there; but afterwards,
whenever he went that way in his circuit, he constantly called there. So
well pleased was she with her guest, and so desirous of his company,
that she would not only bid him welcome to her table, but provide a
lodging-room for him in her house, that he might make the longer stay,
not doubting but her house would be blessed for his sake, and all under
her roof edified by his pious instructions and example - a good design,
yet she would not do it without acquainting her husband, would neither
lay out his money nor invite strangers to his house without his consent
asked and obtained, [Kg2 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#009.md), [Kg2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#010.md). She suggests to him, 1. That the
stranger she would invite was a holy man of God, who therefore would do
good to their family, and God would recompense the kindness done to him;
perhaps she had heard how well paid the widow of Sarepta was for
entertaining Elijah. 2. That the kindness she intended him would be no
great charge to them; she would build him only a little chamber. Perhaps
she had no spare room in the house, or none private and retired enough
for him, who spent much of his time in contemplation, and cared not for
being disturbed with the noise of the family. The furniture shall be
very plain; no costly hangings, no stands, no couches, no
looking-glasses, but a bed, and a table, a stool, and a candlestick, all
that was needful for his convenience, not only for his repose, but for
his study, his reading and writing. Elisha seemed highly pleased with
these accommodations, for he turned in and lay there ([Kg2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#011).md), and, as it should seem, his man
in the same chamber, for he was far from taking state.

II\. Elisha's gratitude for this kindness. Being exceedingly pleased
with the quietness of his apartment, and the friendliness of his
entertainment, he began to consider with himself what recompence he
should make her. Those that receive courtesies should study to return
them; it ill becomes men of God to be ungrateful, or to sponge upon
those that are generous. 1. He offered to use his interest for her in
the king's court ([Kg2 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#013).md): Thou
hast been careful for us with all this care (thus did he magnify the
kindness he received, as those that are humble are accustomed to do,
though in the purse of one so rich, and in the breast of one so free, it
was as nothing); now what shall be done for thee? As the liberal devise
liberal things, so the grateful devise grateful things. "Wouldst thou be
spoken for to the king, or the captain of the host, for an office for
thy husband, civil or military? Hast thou any complaint to make, any
petition to present, any suit at law depending, that needs the
countenance of the high powers? Wherein can I serve thee?" It seems
Elisha had got such an interest by his late services that, though he
chose not to prefer himself by it, yet he was capable of preferring his
friends. A good man can take as much pleasure in serving others as in
raising himself. But she needs not any good offices of this kind to be
done for her: I dwell (says she) among my own people, that is, "We are
well off as we are, and do not aim at preferment." It is a happiness to
dwell among our own people, that love and respect us, and to whom we are
in a capacity of doing good; and a greater happiness to be content to do
so, to be easy, and to know when we are well off. Why should those that
live comfortably among their own people covet to live delicately in
kings' palaces? It would be well with many if they did but know when
they were well off. Some years after this we find this Shunammite had
occasion to be spoken for to the king, though now she needed it not,
[Kg2 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#003.md), [Kg2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#004.md). Those that dwell among their own
people must not think their mountain stands so strong as that it cannot
be moved; they may be driven, as this good woman was, to sojourn among
strangers. Our continuing city is above. 2. He did use his interest for
her in the court of heaven, which was far better. Elisha consulted with
his servant what kindness he should do for her, to such a freedom did
this great prophet admit even his servant. Gehazi reminded him that she
was childless, had a great estate, but no son to leave it to, and was
past hopes of having any, her husband being old. If Elisha could obtain
this favour from God for her, it would be the removal of that which at
present was her only grievance. Those are the most welcome kindnesses
which are most suited to our necessities. He sent for her immediately.
She very humbly and respectfully stood in the door ([Kg2
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#015).md), according to her accustomed
modesty, and then he assured her that within a year she should bring
forth a son, [Kg2 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#016.md). She had
received this prophet in the name of a prophet, and now she had not a
courtier's reward, in being spoken for to the king, but a prophet's
reward, a signal mercy given by prophets and in answer to prayer: the
promise was a surprise to her, and she begged that she might not be
flattered by it: "Nay, my lord, thou are a man of God, and therefore I
hope speakest seriously, and doth not jest with me, nor lie unto thy
handmaid." The event, within the time limited, confirmed the truth of
the promise: She bore a son at the season that Elisha spoke of, [Kg2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#017.md). God built up her house, in
reward to her kindness in building the prophet a chamber. We may well
imagine what joy this brought to the family. Sing, O barren! thou that
didst not bear.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 4:18</span></span>

We may well suppose that, after the birth of this son, the prophet was
doubly welcome to the good Shunammite. He had thought himself indebted
to her, but henceforth, as long as she lives, she will think herself in
his debt, and that she can never do too much for him. We may also
suppose that the child was very dear to the prophet, as the son of his
prayers, and very dear to the parents, as the son of their old age. But
here is,

I. The sudden death of the child, though so much a darling. he was so
far past the perils of infancy that he was able to go to the field to
his father, who no doubt was pleased with his engaging talk, and his joy
of his son was greater than the joy of his harvest; but either the cold
or the heat of the open field overcame the child, who was bred tenderly,
and he complained to his father that his head ached, [Kg2
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#019.md). Whither should we go with our
complaints, but to our heavenly Father? Thither the Spirit of adoption
brings believers with all their grievances, all their desires, teaching
them to cry, with groanings that cannot be uttered, "My head, my head;
my heart, my heart." The father sent him to his mother's arms, his
mother's lap, little suspecting any danger in his indisposition, but
hoping he would drop asleep in his mother's bosom and awake well; but
the sickness proved fatal; he slept the sleep of death ([Kg2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#020).md), was well in the morning and
dead by noon: all the mother's care and tenderness could not keep him
alive. A child of promise, a child of prayer, and given in love, yet
taken away. Little children lie open to the arrests of sickness and
death. But how admirably does the prudent pious mother guard her lips
under this surprising affliction! Not one peevish murmuring word comes
from her. She has a strong belief that the child will be raised to life
again: like a genuine daughter of Abraham's faith, as well as loins, she
accounts that God is able to raise him from the dead, for thence at
first she received him in a figure, [Heb
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#019.md). She had heard of the raising of
the widow's son of Sarepta, and that the spirit of Elijah rested on
Elisha; and such confidence had she of God's goodness that she was very
ready to believe that he who so soon took away what he had given would
restore what he had now taken away. By this faith women received their
dead raised to life, [Heb 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#035.md). In
this faith she makes no preparation for the burial of her dead child,
but for its resurrection; for she lays him on the prophet's bed ([Kg2
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#021).md), expecting that he will stand
her friend. O woman! great is thy faith. he that wrought it would not
frustrate it.

II\. The sorrowful mother's application to the prophet on this sad
occasion; for it happened very opportunely that he was now at the
college upon Mount Carmel, not far off.

1\. She begged leave of her husband to go to the prophet, yet not
acquainting him with her errand, lest he should not have faith enough to
let her go, [Kg2 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#022.md). He objected, It
is neither new moon nor sabbath ([Kg2
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#023).md), which intimates that on those
feasts of the Lord she used to go to the assembly in which he presided,
with other good people, to hear the word, and to join with him in
prayers and praises. She did not think it enough to have his help
sometimes in her own family, but, though a great woman, attended on
public worship, for which this was none of the times appointed;
therefore, said the husband, "why wilt thou go to day? What is the
matter?" "No harm," said she, "It shall be well, so you will say
yourself hereafter." See how this husband and wife vied with each other
in showing mutual regard; she was so dutiful to him that she would not
go till she had acquainted him with her journey, and he so kind to her
that he would not oppose it, though she did not think fit to acquaint
him with her business. 2. She made all the haste she could to the
prophet ([Kg2 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#024).md), and he, seeing
her at a distance, sent his servant to enquire whether any thing was
amiss, [Kg2 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#025.md), [Kg2
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#026.md). The questions were particular:
Is it well with thee? Is it well with thy husband? Is it well with the
child? Note, It well becomes the men of God, with tenderness and
concern, to enquire about the welfare of their friends and their
families. The answer was general It is well. Gehazi was not the man that
she came to complain to, and therefore she put him off with this; she
said little, and little said is soon amended ([Psa
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001.md), [Psa
39:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#002).md), but what she did say was very
patient: "It is well with me, with my husband, with the child" - all
well, and yet the child dead in the house. Note, When God calls away our
dearest relations by death it becomes us quietly to say, "It is well
both with us and them;" it is well, for all is well that God does; all
is well with those that are gone if they have gone to heaven, and all
well with us that stay behind if by the affliction we are furthered in
our way thither. 3. When she came to the prophet she humbly reasoned
with him concerning her present affliction. She threw herself at his
feet, as one troubled and in grief, which she never showed till she came
to him who, she believed, could help her, [Kg2
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#027.md). When her passion would do her
service she knew how to discover it, as well as how to conceal it when
it would do her disservice. Gehazi knew his master would not be pleased
to see her lie at his feet, and therefore would have raised her up; but
Elisha waited to hear from her, since he might not know immediately from
God, what was the cause of her trouble. God discovered things to his
prophets as he saw fit, not always as they desired; God did not show
this to the prophet, because he might know it from the good woman
herself. What she said was very pathetic. She appealed to the prophet,
(1.) Concerning her indifference to this mercy which was now taken from
her: "Did I desire a son of my lord? No, thou knowest I did not; it was
thy own proposal, not mine; I did not fret for the want of a son, as
Hannah, nor beg, as Rachel, Give me children or else I die." Note, When
any creature-comfort is taken from us, it is well if we can say, through
grace, that we did not set our hearts inordinately upon it; for, if we
did, we have reason to fear it was given in anger and taken away in
wrath. (2.) Concerning her entire dependence upon the prophet's word:
Did I not say, Do not deceive me? Yes, she did say so ([Kg2
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#016).md), and this reflection upon it may
be considered either, \[1.\] As quarrelling with the prophet for
deceiving her. She was ready to think herself mocked with the mercy when
it was so soon removed, and that it would have been better she had never
had this child than to be deprived of him when she began to have comfort
in him. Note, The loss of a mercy should not make us undervalue the gift
of it. Or, \[2.\] As pleading with the prophet for the raising of the
child to life again: "I said, Do not deceive me, and I know thou wilt
not." Note, However the providence of God may disappoint us, we may be
sure the promise of God never did, nor ever will, deceive us: hope in
that will not make us ashamed.

III\. The raising of the child to life again. We may suppose that the
woman gave Elisha a more express account of the child's death, and he
gave her a more express promise of his resurrection, than is here
related, where we are briefly told,

1\. That Elisha sent Gehazi to go in all haste to the dead child, gave
him his staff, and bade him lay that on the face of the child, [Kg2
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#029.md). I know not what to make of this.
Elisha knew that Elijah raised the dead child with a very close
application, stretching himself upon the child, and praying again and
again, and could he think to raise this child by so slight a ceremony as
this, especially when nothing hindered him from coming himself? Shall
such a power as this be delegated, and to no better man that Gehazi?
Bishop Hall suggests that it was done out of human conceit, and not by
divine instinct, and therefore it failed of the effect; God will not
have such great favours made too cheap, nor shall they be too easily
come by, lest they be undervalued.

2\. The woman resolved not to go back without the prophet himself ([Kg2
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#030).md): I will not leave thee. She had
no great expectation from the staff, she would have the hand, and she
was in the right of it. Perhaps God intended hereby to teach us not to
put that confidence in creatures, that are servants, which the power of
the Creator, their Master and ours, will alone bear the weight of.
Gehazi returns re infecta - without success, without the tidings of any
sign of life in the child ([Kg2 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#031).md):
The child is not awaked, intimating, to the comfort of the mother, that
its death was but a sleep, and that he expected that it would shortly be
awaked. In the raising of dead souls to spiritual life ministers can do
no more by their own power than Gehazi here could; they lay the word,
like the prophet's staff, before their faces, but there is neither voice
nor hearing, till Christ, by his Spirit, comes himself. The letter alone
kills; it is the Spirit that gives life. It is not prophesying upon dry
bones that will put life into them, breath must come from heaven and
breathe upon those slain.

3\. The prophet, by earnest prayer, obtained from God the restoring of
this dead child to life again. He found the child dead upon his own bed
([Kg2 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#032).md), and shut the door upon
them twain, [Kg2 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#033.md). Even the dead
child is spoken of as a person, one of the twain, for it was still in
being and not lost. He shut out all company, that he might not seem to
glory in the power God had given him, or to use it for ostentation and
to be seen of men. Observe,

(1.) How closely the prophet applied himself to this great operation,
perhaps being sensible that he had tempted God too much in thinking to
effect it by the staff in Gehazi's hand, for which he thought himself
rebuked by the disappointment. He now found it a harder task than he
then thought, and therefore addressed himself to it with great
solemnity. \[1.\] He prayed unto the Lord ([Kg2
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#033).md), probably as Elijah had done,
Let this child's soul come into him again. Christ raised the dead to
life as one having authority - Damsel, arise - young man, I say unto
thee, Arise - Lazarus, come forth (for he was powerful and faithful as a
Son, the Lord of life), but Elijah and Elisha did it by petition, as
servants. \[2.\] He lay upon the child ([Kg2
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#034).md), as if he would communicate to
him some of his vital heat or spirits. Thus he expressed the earnestness
of his desire, and gave a sign of that divine power which he depended
upon for the accomplishment of this great work. He first put his mouth
to the child's mouth, as if, in God's name, he would breathe into him
the breath of life; then his eyes to the child's eyes, to open them
again to the light of life; then his hands to the child's hands, to put
strength into them. He then returned, and walked in the house, as one
full of care and concern, and wholly intent upon what he was about. Then
he went up stairs again, and the second time, stretched himself upon the
child, [Kg2 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#035.md). Those that would be
instrumental in conveying spiritual life to dead souls must thus affect
themselves with their case, and accommodate themselves to it, and labour
fervently in prayer for them.

(2.) How gradually the operation was performed. At the first
application, the flesh of the child waxed warm ([Kg2
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#034).md), which gave the prophet
encouragement to continue instant in prayer. After a while, the child
sneezed seven times, which was an indication, not only of life, but
liveliness. Some have reported it as an ancient tradition that when God
breathed into Adam the breath of life the first evidence of his being
alive was sneezing, which gave rise to the usage of paying respect to
those that sneeze. Some observe here that sneezing clears the head, and
there lay the child's distemper.

(3.) How joyfully the child was restored alive to his mother ([Kg2
4:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#036.md), [Kg2
4:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#037).md), and all parties concerned were
not a little comforted, [Act 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#012.md).
See the power of God, who kills and makes alive again. See the power of
prayer; as it has the key of the clouds, so it has the key of death. See
the power of faith; that fixed law of nature (that death is a way whence
there is no returning) shall rather be dispensed with than this
believing Shunammite shall be disappointed.

We have here Elisha in his place, in his element, among the sons of the
prophets, teaching them, and, as a father, providing for them; and happy
it was for them that they had one over them who naturally cared for
their state, under whom they were well fed and well taught. There was a
dearth in the land, for the wickedness of those that dwelt therein, the
same that we read of, [Kg2 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#001.md). It
continued seven years, just as long again as that in Elijah's time. A
famine of bread there was, but not of hearing the word of God, for
Elisha had the sons of the prophets sitting before him, to hear his
wisdom, who were taught, that they might teach others. Two instances we
have here of the care he took about their meat. Christ twice fed those
to whom he preached. Elisha was in the more care about it now because of
the dearth, that the sons of the prophets might not be ashamed in this
evil time, but, even in the days of famine, might be satisfied, [Psa
37:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#019.md).

I. He made hurtful food to become safe and wholesome. 1. On the
lecture-day, the sons of the prophets being all to attend, he ordered
his servant to provide food for their bodies, while he was breaking to
them the bread of life for their souls. Whether there was any flesh-meat
for them does not appear; he orders only that pottage should be seethed
for them of herbs, [Kg2 4:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#038.md). The sons
of the prophets should be examples of temperance and mortification, not
desirous of dainties, but content with plain food. If they have neither
savoury meats nor sweet meats, nay, if a mess of pottage be all the
dinner, let them remember that this great prophet entertained himself
and his guests no better. 2. One of the servitors, who was sent to
gather herbs (which, it should seem, must serve instead of flesh for the
pottage), by mistake brought in that which was noxious, or at least very
nauseous, and shred it into the pottage: wild gourds they are called,
[Kg2 4:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#039.md). Some think it was
coloquintida, a herb strongly cathartic, and, if not qualified,
dangerous. The sons of the prophets, it seems, were better skilled in
divinity than in natural philosophy, and read their Bibles more than
their herbals. If any of the fruits of the earth be hurtful, we must
look upon it as an effect of the curse (thorns and thistles shall it
bring forth unto thee), for the original blessing made all good. 3. The
guests complained to Elisha of the unwholesomeness of their food. Nature
has given man the sense of tasting, not only that wholesome food may be
pleasant, but that that which is unwholesome may be discovered before it
comes to the stomach; the mouth tries meat by tasting it, [Job
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#011.md). This pottage was soon found by
the taste of it to be dangerous, so that they cried out, There is death
in the pot, [Kg2 4:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#040.md). The table often
becomes a snare, and that which should be for our welfare proves a trap,
which is a good reason why we should not feed ourselves without fear;
when we are receiving the supports and comforts of life we must keep up
an expectation of death and a fear of sin. 4. Elisha immediately cured
the bad taste and prevented the bad consequences of this unwholesome
pottage; as before he had healed the bitter waters with salt, so now the
bitter broth with meal, [Kg2 4:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#041.md). It
is probable that there was meal in it before, but that was put in by a
common hand, only to thicken the pottage; this was the same thing, but
cast in by Elisha's hand, and with intent to heal the pottage, by which
it appears that the change was not owing to the meal (that was the sign
only, not the means), but to the divine power. Now all was well, not
only no death, but no harm in the pot. We must acknowledge God's
goodness in making our food wholesome and nourishing. I am the Lord that
healeth thee.

II\. He made a little food to go a great way. 1. Elisha had a present
brought him of twenty barley-loaves and some ears of corn ([Kg2
4:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#042).md), a present which, in those ages,
would not be despicable at any time, but now in a special manner
valuable, when there was a dearth in the land. It is said to be of the
first-fruits, which was God's due out of their increase; and when the
priests and Levites were all at Jerusalem, out of their reach, the
religious people among them, with good reason, looked upon the prophets
as God's receivers, and brought their first-fruits to them, which helped
to maintain their schools. 2. Having freely received, he freely gave,
ordering it all to be set before the sons of the prophets, reserving
none for himself, none for the hereafter. "Let the morrow take thought
for the things of itself, give it all to the people that they may eat."
It well becomes the men of God to be generous and open-handed, and the
fathers of the prophets to be liberal to the sons of the prophets. 3.
Though the loaves were little, it is likely no more than what one man
would ordinarily eat at a meal, yet with twenty of them he satisfied 100
men, [Kg2 4:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#043.md), [Kg2
4:44](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#044.md). his servant thought that to set
so little meat before so many men was but to tantalize them, and shame
his master for making so great an invitation to such short commons; but
he in God's name, pronounced it a full meal for them, and so it proved;
they did eat, and left thereof, not because their stomachs failed them,
but because the bread increased in the eating. God has promised his
church ([Psa 132:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#015).md) that he will
abundantly bless her provision, and satisfy her poor with bread; for
whom he feeds he fills, and what he blesses comes to much, as what he
blows upon comes to little, [Hag 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#009.md).
Christ's feeding his hearers was a miracle far beyond this; but both
teach us that those who wait upon God in the way of duty may hope to be
both protected and supplied by a particular care of divine Providence.
