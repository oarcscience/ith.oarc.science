[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 11:0</span></span>

The revolution in the kingdom of Israel was soon perfected in Jehu's
settlement; we must now enquire into the affairs of the kingdom of
Judah, which lost its head (such as it was) at the same time, and by the
same hand, as Israel lost its head; but things continued longer there in
distraction than in Israel, yet, after some years, they were brought
into a good posture, as we find in this chapter. I. Athaliah usurps the
government and destroys all the seed-royal ([Kg2
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#001).md). II. Joash, a child of a year
old, is wonderfully preserved ([Kg2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#002.md), [Kg2
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#003).md). III. At six years' end he is
produced, and, by the agency of Jehoiada, made king ([Kg2
11:4-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#004).md). IV. Athaliah is slain ([Kg2
11:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#013).md). V. Both the civil and
religious interests of the kingdom are well settled in the hands of
Joash ([Kg2 11:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#017).md). And thus, after
some interruption, things returned with advantage into the old channel.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 11:1</span></span>

God had assured David of the continuance of his family, which is called
his ordaining a lamp for his anointed; and this cannot but appear a
great thing, now that we have read of the utter extirpation of so many
royal families, one after another. Now here we have David's promised
lamp almost extinguished and yet wonderfully preserved.

I. It was almost extinguished by the barbarous malice of Athaliah, the
queen-mother, who, when she heard that her son Ahaziah was slain by
Jehu, arose and destroyed all the seed-royal ([Kg2
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#001).md), all that she knew to be akin to
the crown. Her husband Jehoram had slain all his brethren the sons of
Jehoshaphat, [Ch2 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#004.md). The Arabians
had slain all Jehoram's sons except Ahaziah, [Ch2
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001.md). Jehu had slain all their sons
([Ch2 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#008).md) and Ahaziah himself.
Surely never was royal blood so profusely shed. Happy the men of
inferior birth, who live below envy and emulation! But, as if all this
were but a small matter, Athaliah destroyed all that were left of the
seed-royal. It was strange that one of the tender sex could be so
barbarous, that one who had been herself a king's daughter, a king's
wife, and a king's mother, could be so barbarous to a royal family, and
a family into which she was herself ingrafted; but she did it, 1. From a
spirit of ambition. She thirsted after rule, and thought she could not
get to it any other way. That none might reign with her, she slew even
the infants and sucklings that might have reigned after her. For fear of
a competitor, not any must be reserved for a successor. 2. From a spirit
of revenge and rage against God. The house of Ahab being utterly
destroyed, and her son Ahaziah among the rest, because he was akin to
it, she resolved, as it were, by way of reprisal, to destroy the house
of David, and cut off his line, in defiance of God's promise to
perpetuate it - a foolish attempt and fruitless, for who can disannul
what God hath purposed? Grandmothers have been thought more fond of
their grandchildren than they were of their own; yet Ahaziah's own
mother is the wilful murderer of Ahazaiah's own sons, and in their
infancy too, when she was obliged, above any other, to nurse them and
take care of them. Well might she be called Athaliah, that wicked woman
([Ch2 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#007).md), Jezebel's own daughter;
yet herein God was righteous, and visited the iniquity of Joram and
Ahaziah, those degenerate branches of David's house, upon their
children.

II\. It was wonderfully preserved by the pious care of one of Joram's
daughters (who was wife to Jehoiada the priest), who stole away one of
the king's sons, Joash by name, and hid him, [Kg2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#002.md), [Kg2
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#003.md). This was a brand plucked out of
the fire; what number were slain we are not told, but, it seems, this
being a child in the nurse's arms was not missed, or not enquired after,
or at least no found. The person that delivered him was his own aunt,
the daughter of wicked Joram; for God will raise up protectors for those
whom he will have protected. The place of his safety was the house of
the Lord, one of the chambers belonging to the temple, a place Athaliah
seldom troubled. His aunt, by bringing him hither, put him under God's
special protection, and so hid him by faith, as Moses was hidden. Now
were David's words made good to one of his seed ([Psa
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005).md), In the secret of his tabernacle
shall he hide me. With good reason did this Joash, when he grew up, set
himself to repair the house of the Lord, for it had been a sanctuary to
him. Now was the promise made to David bound up in one life, and yet it
did not fail. Thus to the son of David will God, according to his
promise, secure a spiritual seed, which, though sometimes reduced to a
small number, brought very low, and seemingly lost, will be perpetuated
to the end of time, hidden sometimes and unseen, but hidden in God's
pavilion and unhurt. It was a special providence that Joram, though a
king, a wicked king, married his daughter to Jehoiada a priest, a godly
priest. Some perhaps thought it a disparagement to the royal family to
marry a daughter to a clergyman, but it proved a happy marriage, and the
saving of the royal family from ruin; for Jehoiada's interest in the
temple gave her an opportunity to preserve the child, and her interest
in the royal family gave him an opportunity to set him on the throne.
See the wisdom and care of Providence, and how it prepares for what it
designs; and see what blessings those lay up in store for their families
that marry their children to those that are wise and good.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 11:4</span></span>

Six years Athaliah tyrannised. We have not a particular account of her
reign; no doubt it was of a piece with the beginning. While Jehu was
extirpating the worship of Baal in Israel, she was establishing it in
Judah, as appears, [Ch2 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#007.md). The
court and kingdom of Judah had been debauched by their alliance with the
house of Ahab, and now one of that house is a curse and a plague to
both: sinful friendships speed no better. All this while, Joash lay hid,
entitled to a crown and intended for it, and yet buried alive in
obscurity. Though the sons and heirs of heaven are now hidden, the world
knows them not ([Jo1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001).md), yet the
time is fixed when they shall appear in glory, as Joash in his seventh
year; by that time he was ready to be shown, not a babe, but, having
served his first apprenticeship to life and arrived at his first
climacterical year, he had taken a good step towards manhood; by that
time the people had grown weary of Athaliah's tyranny and ripe for a
revolution. How that revolution was effected we are here told.

I. The manager of this great affair was Jehoiada the priest, probably
the high priest, or at least the sagan (as the Jews called him) or
suffragan to the high priest. By his birth and office he was a man in
authority, whom the people were bound by the law to observe and obey,
especially when there was no rightful king upon the throne, [Deu
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#012.md). By marriage he was allied to
the royal family, and, if all the seed-royal were destroyed, his wife,
as daughter to Joram, had a better title to the crown than Athaliah had.
By his eminent gifts and graces he was fitted to serve his country, and
better service he could not do it than to free it from Athaliah's
usurpation; and we have reason to think he did not make this attempt
till he had first asked counsel of God and known his mind, either by
prophets or Urim, perhaps by both.

II\. The management was very discreet and as became so wise and good a
man as Jehoiada was.

1\. He concerted the matter with the rulers of hundreds and the
captains, the men in office, ecclesiastical, civil, and military; he got
them to him to the temple, consulted with them, laid before them the
grievances they at present laboured under, gave them an oath of secresy,
and, finding them free and forward to join with him, showed them the
king's son ([Kg2 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#004).md), and so well
satisfied were they with his fidelity that they saw no reason to suspect
an imposition. We may well think what a pleasing surprise it was to the
good people among them, who feared that the house and lineage of David
were quite cut off, to find such a spark as this in the embers.

2\. He posted the priests and Levites, who were more immediately under
his direction, in the several avenues to the temple, to keep the guard,
putting them under the command of the rulers of hundreds, [Kg2
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#009.md). David had divided the priests
into courses, which waited by turns. Every sabbath-day morning a new
company came into waiting, but the company of the foregoing week did not
go out of waiting till the sabbath evening, so that on the sabbath day,
when double service was to be done, there was a double number to do it,
both those that were to come in and those that were to go out. These
Jehoiada employed to attend on this great occasion; he armed them out of
the magazines of the temple with David's spears and shields, either his
own or those he had taken from his enemies, which he devoted to God's
honour, [Kg2 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#010.md). If they were old
and unfashionable, yet those that used them might, by their being
David's, be reminded of God's covenant with him, which they were now
acting in the defence of. Two things they were ordered to do: - (1.) To
protect the young king from being insulted; they must keep the watch of
the king's house ([Kg2 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#005).md), compass
the king, and be with him ([Kg2 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#008).md),
to guard him from Athaliah's partizans, for still there were those that
thirsted after royal blood. (2.) To preserve the holy temple from being
profaned by the concourse of people that would come together on this
occasion ([Kg2 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#006).md): Keep the watch
of the house, that it be neither broken through nor broken down, and so
strangers should crowd in, or such as were unclean. He was not so
zealous for the projected revolution as to forget his religion. In times
of the greatest hurry care must be taken, Ne detrimentum capiat ecclesia
- That the holy things of God be not trenched upon. It is observable
that Jehoiada appointed to each his place as well as his work ([Kg2
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#006.md), [Kg2
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#007).md), for good order contributes very
much to the expediting and accomplishing of any great enterprise. Let
every man know, and keep, and make good, his post, and then the work
will be done quickly.

3\. When the guards were fixed, then the king was brought forth, [Kg2
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#012.md). Rejoice greatly, O daughter of
Sion! for even in thy holy mountain thy king appears, a child indeed,
but not such a one as brings a woe upon the land, for he is the son of
nobles, the son of David ([Ecc 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#017).md)
- a child indeed, but he had a good guardian, and, which was better, a
good God, to go to. Jehoiada, without delay, proceeded to the coronation
of this young king; for, though he was not yet capable of despatching
business, he would be growing up towards it by degrees. This was done
with great solemnity, [Kg2 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#012). (1..md)
In token of his being invested with kingly power, he put the crown upon
him, though it was yet too large and heavy for his head. The regalia, it
is probable, were kept in the temple, and so the crown was ready at
hand. (2.) In token of his obligation to govern by law, and to make the
word of God his rule, he gave him the testimony, put into his hand a
Bible, in which he must read all the days of his life, [Deu
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#018.md), [Deu
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#019). (3..md) In token of his receiving
the Spirit, to qualify him for this great work to which he before was
called, he anointed him. Though notice is taken of the anointing of the
kings only in case of interruption, as here, and in Solomon's case, yet
I know not but the ceremony might be used for all their kings, at least
those of the house of David, because their royalty was typical of
Christ's, who was to be anointed above his fellows, above all the sons
of David. (4.) In token of the people's acceptance of him and subjection
to his government, they clapped their hands for joy, and expressed their
hearty good wishes to him: Let the king live; and thus they made him
king, made him their king, consented to, and concurred with, the divine
appointment. They had reason to rejoice in the period now put to
Athaliah's tyranny, and the prospect they had of the restoration and
establishment of religion by a king under the tuition of so good a man
as Jehoiada. They had reason to bid him welcome to the crown whose right
it was, and to pray, Let him live, concerning him who came to them as
life from the dead and in whom the house of David was to live. With such
acclamations of joy and satisfaction must the kingdom of Christ be
welcomed into our hearts when his throne is set up there and Satan the
usurper is deposed. Hosanna, blessed is he that comes: clap hands, and
say, "Let King Jesus live, for ever live and reign, in my soul, and in
all the world;" it is promised ([Psa
72:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015).md), He shall live, and prayer
shall be made for him, and his kingdom, continually.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 11:13</span></span>

We may suppose it was designed when they had finished the solemnity of
the king's inauguration, to pay a visit to Athaliah, and call her to an
account for her murders, usurpation, and tyranny; but, like her mother
Jezebel, she saved them the labour, went out to meet them, and hastened
her own destruction. 1. Hearing the noise, she came in a fright to see
what was the matter, [Kg2 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#013.md).
Jehoiada and his friends began in silence, but now that they found their
strength, they proclaimed what they were doing. It seems, Athaliah was
little regarded, else she would have had intelligence brought her of
this daring attempt before with her own ears she heard the noise; had
the design been discovered before it was perfected, it might have been
quashed, but now it was too late. When she heard the noise it was
strange that she was so ill advised as to come herself, and, for aught
that appears, to come alone. Surely she was not so neglected as to have
none to go for her, or none to go with her, but she was wretchedly
infatuated by the transport both of fear and indignation she was in.
Whom God will destroy he befools. 2. Seeing what was done she cried out
for help. She saw the king's place by the pillar possessed by one to
whom the princes and people did homage ([Kg2
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#014).md) and had reason to conclude her
power at an end, which she knew was usurped; this made her rend her
clothes, like one distracted, and cry, "Treason! treason! Come and help
against the traitors." Josephus adds that she cried to have him killed
that possessed the king's place. What was now doing was the highest
justice, yet it was branded as the highest crime; she herself was the
greatest traitor, and yet was first and loudest in crying Treason!
treason! Those that are themselves most guilty are commonly most forward
to reproach others. 3. Jehoiada gave orders to put her to death as an
idolater, a usurper, and an enemy to the public peace. Care was taken,
(1.) That she should not be killed in the temple, or any of the courts
of it, in reverence to that holy place, which must not be stained with
the blood of any human sacrifice, though ever so justly offered. (2.)
That whoever appeared for her should die with her: "Him that follows
her, to protect or rescue her, any of her attendants that resolve to
adhere to her and will not come into the interests of their rightful
sovereign, kill with the sword, but not unless they follow her now,"
[Kg2 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#015.md). According to these orders,
she endeavouring to make her escape the back way to the palace, through
the stalls, they pursued her, and there killed her, [Kg2
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#016.md). So let thy enemies perish, O
Lord! thus give the bloody harlot blood to drink, for she is worthy.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 11:17</span></span>

Jehoiada had now got over the harlot part of his work, when, by the
death of Athaliah, the young prince had his way to the throne cleared of
all opposition. He had now to improve his advantages for the perfecting
of the revolution and the settling of the government. Two things we have
an account of here: -

I. The good foundations he laid, by an original contract, [Kg2
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#017.md). Now that prince and people were
together in God's house, as it should seem before they stirred, Jehoiada
took care that they should jointly covenant with God, and mutually
covenant with each other, that they might rightly understand their duty
both to God and to one another, and be firmly bound to it. 1. He
endeavoured to settle and secure the interests of religion among them,
by a covenant between them and God. King and people would then cleave
most firmly to each other when both had joined themselves to the Lord.
God had already, on his part, promised to be their God (Jehoiada could
show them that in the book of the testimony); now the king and people on
their part must covenant and agree that they will be the Lord's people:
in this covenant, the king stands upon the same level with his subjects
and is as much bound as any of them to serve the Lord. By this
engagement they renounced Baal, whom many of them had worshipped, and
resigned themselves to God's government. It is well with a people when
all the changes that pass over them help to revive, strengthen, and
advance the interests of religion among them. And those are likely to
prosper who set out in the world under fresh and sensible obligations to
God and their duty. By our bonds to God the bonds of every relation are
strengthened. They first gave themselves to the Lord, and then to us,
[Co2 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#005.md). 2. He then settled both the
coronation-oath and the oath of allegiance, the pacta conventa -
covenant, between the king and the people, by which the king was obliged
to govern according to law and to protect his subjects, and they were
obliged, while he did so, to obey him and to bear faith and true
allegiance to him. Covenants are of use both to remind us of and to bind
us to those duties which are already binding on us. It is good, in all
relations, for the parties to understand one another fully, particularly
in that between prince and subject, that the one may understand the
limits of his power and prerogative, the other those of his liberty and
property; and never may the ancient landmarks which our fathers have set
before them be removed.

II\. The good beginnings he raised on those foundations. 1. Pursuant to
their covenant with God they immediately abolished idolatry, which the
preceding kings, in compliance with the house of Ahab, had introduced
([Kg2 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#018).md): All the people of the
land, the mob, got together, to show their zeal against idolatry; and
every one, now that they were so well headed, would lend a hand to pull
down Baal's temple, his altars, and his images. All his worshippers, it
should seem, deserted him; only his priest Mattan stuck to his altar.
Though all men forsook Baal, he would not, and there he was slain, the
best sacrifice that ever was offered upon that altar. Having destroyed
Baal's temple, they appointed officers over the house of God, to see
that the service of God was regularly performed by the proper persons,
in due time, and according to the institutional manner. 2. Pursuant to
their covenant with one another they expressed a mutual readiness to and
satisfaction in each other. (1.) The king was brought in state to the
royal palace, and sat there on the throne of judgment, the thrones of
the house of David ([Kg2 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#019).md), ready
to receive petitions and appeals, which he would refer it to Jehoiada to
give answers to and to give judgment upon. (2.) The people rejoiced, and
Jerusalem was in quiet ([Kg2 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#020).md),
and Josephus says they kept a feast of joy many days, making good
Solomon's observation ([Pro 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#010).md),
When it goes well with the righteous the city rejoices, and when the
wicked perish there is shouting.
