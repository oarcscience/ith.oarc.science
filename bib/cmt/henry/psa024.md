### [Psalms Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 24:0</span></span>

This psalm is concerning the kingdom of Jesus Christ, I. His
providential kingdom, by which he rules the world ([Psa
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md), [Psa
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#002).md). II. The kingdom of his grace,
by which he rules in his church. 1. Concerning the subjects of that
kingdom; their character ([Psa 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004.md),
[Psa 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#006).md), their charter ([Psa
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#005).md). 2. Concerning the King of that
kingdom; and a summons to all to give him admission ([Psa
24:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007).md). It is supposed that the
psalm was penned upon occasion of David's bringing up the ark to the
place prepared for it, and that the intention of it was to lead the
people above the pomp of external ceremonies to a holy life and faith in
Christ, of whom the ark was a type.

A psalm of David.

[Psalms 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 24:1</span></span>

Here is, I. God's absolute propriety in this part of the creation where
our lot is cast, [Psa 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md). We are not
to think that the heavens, even the heavens only, are the Lord's, and
the numerous and bright inhabitants of the upper world, and that this
earth, being so small and inconsiderable a part of the creation, and at
such a distance from the royal palace above, is neglected, and that he
claims no interest in it. No, even the earth is his, and this lower
world; and, though he has prepared the throne of his glory in the
heavens, yet his kingdom rules over all, and even the worms of this
earth are not below his cognizance, nor from under his dominion. 1. When
God gave the earth to the children of men he still reserved to himself
the property, and only let it out to them as tenants, or usufructuaries:
The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof. The mines that are
lodged in the bowels of it, even the richest, the fruits it produces,
all the beasts of the forest and the cattle upon a thousand hills, our
lands and houses, and all the improvements that are made of this earth
by the skill and industry of man, are all his. These indeed, in the
kingdom of grace, are justly looked upon as emptiness; for they are
vanity of vanities, nothing to a soul; but, in the kingdom of
providence, they are fulness. The earth is full of God's riches, so is
the great and wide sea also. All the parts and regions of the earth are
the Lord's, all under his eye, all in his hand: so that, wherever a
child of God goes, he may comfort himself with this, that he does not go
off his Father's ground. That which falls to our share of the earth and
its productions is but lent to us; it is the Lord's; what is our own
against all the world is not so against his claims. That which is most
remote from us, as that which passes through the paths of the sea, or is
hidden in the bottom of it, is the Lord's and he knows where to find it.
2. The habitable part of this earth ([Pro
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#031).md) is his in a special manner - the
world and those that dwell therein. We ourselves are not our own, our
bodies, our souls, are not. All souls are mine, says God; for he is the
former of our bodies and the Father of our spirits. Our tongues are not
our own; they are to be at his service. Even those of the children of
men that know him not, nor own their relation to him, are his. Now this
comes in here to show that, though God is graciously pleased to accept
the devotions and services of his peculiar chosen people ([Psa
24:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#003).md), it is not because he needs
them, or can be benefited by them, for the earth is his and all in it,
[Exo 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md); [Psa
50:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#012.md). It is likewise to be applied to
the dominion Christ has, as Mediator, over the utmost parts of the
earth, which are given him for his possession: the Father loveth the Son
and hath given all things into his hand, power over all flesh. The
apostle quotes this scripture twice together in his discourse about
things offered to idols, [Co1 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#026.md),
[Co1 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#028.md). "If it be sold in the
shambles, eat it, and ask no questions; for the earth is the Lord's; it
is God's good creature, and you have a right to it. But, if one tell you
it was offered to an idol, forbear, for the earth is the Lord's, and
there is enough besides." This is a good reason why we should be content
with our allotment in this world, and not envy others theirs; the earth
is the Lord's, and may he not do what he will with his own, and give to
some more of it, to others less, as it pleases him?

II\. The ground of this propriety. The earth is his by an indisputable
title, for he hath founded it upon the seas and established it upon the
floods, [Psa 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#002.md). It is his; for, 1.
He made it, formed it, founded it, and fitted it for the use of man. The
matter is his, for he made it out of nothing; the form is his, for he
made it according to the eternal counsels and ideas of his own mind. He
made it himself, he made it for himself; so that he is sole, entire, and
absolute owner, and none can let us a title to any part, but by, from,
and under him; see [Psa 89:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#011.md), [Psa
89:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#012.md). 2. He made it so as no one else
could. It is the creature of omnipotence, for it is founded upon the
seas, upon the floods, a weak and unstable foundation (one would think)
to build the earth upon, and yet, if almighty power please, it shall
serve to bear the weight of this earth. The waters which at first
covered the earth, and rendered it unfit to be a habitation for man,
were ordered under it, that the dry land might appear, and so they are
as a foundation to it; see [Psa 104:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#008.md),
[Psa 104:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#009.md). 3. He continues it, he has
established it, fixed it, so that, though one generation passes and
another comes, the earth abides, [Ecc
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#004.md). And his providence is a continued
creation, [Psa 119:90](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#090.md). The founding of
the earth upon the floods should remind us how slippery and uncertain
all earthly things are; their foundation is not only sand, but water; it
is therefore our folly to build upon them.

[Psalms 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 24:3</span></span>

From this world, and the fulness thereof, the psalmist's meditations
rise, of a sudden to the great things of another world, the foundation
of which is not on the seas, nor on the floods. The things of this world
God has given to the children of men and we are much indebted to his
providence for them; but they will not make a portion for us. And
therefore,

I. Here is an enquiry after better things, [Psa
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#003.md). This earth is God's footstool;
but, if we had ever so much of it, we must be here but a while, must
shortly go hence, and Who then shall ascend into the hill of the Lord?
Who shall go to heaven hereafter, and, as an earnest of that, shall have
communion with God in holy ordinances now? A soul that knows and
considers its own nature, origin, and immortality, when it has viewed
the earth and the fulness thereof, will sit down unsatisfied; there is
not found among all the creatures a help meet for man, and therefore it
will think of ascending towards God, towards heaven, will ask, "What
shall I do to rise to that high place, that hill, where the Lord dwells
and manifests himself, that I may be acquainted with him, and to abide
in that happy holy place where he meets his people and makes them holy
and happy? What shall I do that I may be of those whom God owns for his
peculiar people and who are his in another manner than the earth is his
and its fulness?" This question is much the same with that, [Psa
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001.md). The hill of Zion on which the
temple was built typified the church, both visible and invisible. When
the people attended the ark to its holy place David puts them in mind
that these were but patterns of heavenly things, and therefore that by
them they should be led to consider the heavenly things themselves.

II\. An answer to this enquiry, in which we have,

1\. The properties of God's peculiar people, who shall have communion
with him in grace and glory. (1.) They are such as keep themselves from
all the gross acts of sin. They have clean hands; not spotted with the
pollutions of the world and the flesh. None that were ceremonially
unclean might enter into the mountain of the temple, which signified
that cleanness of conversation which is required in all those that have
fellowship with God. The hands lifted up in prayer must be pure hands,
no blot of unjust gain cleaving to them, nor any thing else that defiles
the man and is offensive to the holy God. (2.) They are such as make
conscience of being really (that is, of being inwardly) as good as they
seem to be outwardly. They have pure hearts. We make nothing of our
religion if we do not make heart-work of it. It is not enough that our
hands be clean before men, but we must also wash our hearts from
wickedness, and not allow ourselves in any secret heart-impurities,
which are open before the eye of God. Yet in vain do those pretend to
have pure and good hearts whose hands are defiled with the acts of sin.
That is a pure heart which is sincere and without guile in covenanting
with God, which is carefully guarded, that the wicked one, the unclean
spirit, touch it not, which is purified by faith, and conformed to the
image and will of God; see [Mat 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#008.md).
(3.) They are such as do not set their affections upon the things of
this world, do not lift up their souls unto vanity, whose hearts are not
carried out inordinately towards the wealth of this world, the praise of
men, or the delights of sense, who do not choose these things for their
portion, nor reach forth after them, because they believe them to be
vanity, uncertain and unsatisfying. (4.) They are such as deal honestly
both with God and man. In their covenant with God, and their contracts
with men, they have not sworn deceitfully, nor broken their promises,
violated their engagements, nor taken any false oath. Those that have no
regard to the obligations of truth or the honour of God's name are unfit
for a place in God's holy hill. (5.) They are a praying people ([Psa
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#006).md): This is the generation of those
that seek him. In every age there is a remnant of such as these, men of
this character, who are accounted to the Lord for a generation, [Psa
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#030.md). And they are such as seek God,
that seek they face, O Jacob! \[1.\] They join themselves to God, to
seek him, not only in earnest prayer, but in serious endeavours to
obtain his favour and keep themselves in his love. Having made it the
summit of their happiness, they make it the summit of their ambition to
be accepted of him, and therefore take care and pains to approve
themselves to him. It is to the hill of the Lord that we must ascend,
and, the way being up-hill, we have need to put forth ourselves to the
utmost, as those that seek diligently. \[2.\] They join themselves to
the people of God, to seek God with them. Being brought into communion
with God, they come into communion of saints; conforming to the patterns
of the saints that have gone before (so some understand this), they seek
God's face, as Jacob (so some), who was therefore surnamed Israel,
because he wrestled with God and prevailed, sought him and found him;
and, associating with the saints of their own day, they shall court the
favour of God's church ([Rev 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#009).md),
shall be glad of an acquaintance with God's people ([Zac
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#023).md), shall incorporate themselves
with them, and, when they subscribe with their hands to the Lord, shall
call themselves by the name of Jacob, [Isa
44:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#005.md). As soon as ever Paul was
converted he joined himself to the disciples, [Act
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#026.md). They shall seek God's face in
Jacob (so some), that is, in the assemblies of his people. Thy face, O
God of Jacob! so our margin supplies it, and makes it easy. As all
believers are the spiritual seed of Abraham, so all that strive in
prayer are the spiritual seed of Jacob, to whom God never said, Seek you
me in vain.

2\. The privileges of God's peculiar people, [Psa
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#005.md). They shall be made truly and for
ever happy. (1.) They shall be blessed: they shall receive the blessing
from the Lord, all the fruits and gifts of God's favour, according to
his promise; and those whom God blesses are blessed indeed, for it is
his prerogative to command the blessing. (2.) They shall be justified
and sanctified. These are the spiritual blessings in heavenly things
which they shall receive, even righteousness, the very thing they hunger
and thirst after, [Mat 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006.md).
Righteousness is blessedness, and it is from God only that we must
expect it, for we have no righteousness of our own. They shall receive
the reward of their righteousness (so some), the crown of righteousness
which the righteous Judge shall give, [Ti2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008). (3..md) They shall be saved; for God
himself will be the God of their salvation. Note, Where God gives
righteousness he certainly designs salvation. Those that are made meet
for heaven shall be brought safely to heaven, and then they will find
what they have been seeking, to their endless satisfaction.

[Psalms 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 24:7</span></span>

What is spoken once is spoken a second time in these verses; such
repetitions are usual in songs, and have much beauty in them. Here is,
1. Entrance once and again demanded for the King of glory; the doors and
gates are to be thrown open, thrown wide open, to give him admission,
for behold he stands at the door and knocks, ready to come in. 2.
Enquiry once and again made concerning this mighty prince, in whose name
entrance is demanded: Who is this King of glory? As, when any knock at
our door, it is common to ask, Who is there? 3. Satisfaction once and
again given concerning the royal person that makes the demand: It is the
Lord, strong and mighty, the Lord, mighty in battle, the Lord of hosts,
[Psa 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#008.md), [Psa
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#010.md). Now,

I. This splendid entry here described it is probable refers to the
solemn bringing in of the ark into the tent David pitched for it or the
temple Solomon built for it; for, when David prepared materials for the
building of it, it was proper for him to prepare a psalm for the
dedication of it. The porters are called upon to open the doors, and
they are called everlasting doors, because much more durable than the
door of the tabernacle, which was but a curtain. They are taught to ask,
Who is this King of glory? And those that bore the ark are taught to
answer in the language before us, and very fitly, because the ark was a
symbol or token of God's presence, [Jos
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#011.md). Or it may be taken as a poetical
figure designed to represent the subject more affectingly. God, in his
word and ordinances, is thus to be welcomed by us, 1. With great
readiness: the doors and gates must be thrown open to him. Let the word
of the Lord come into the innermost and uppermost place in our souls;
and, if we had 600 necks, we should bow them all to the authority of it.
2. With all reverence, remembering how great a God he is with whom we
have to do, in all our approaches to him.

II\. Doubtless it points at Christ, of whom the ark, with the
mercy-seat, was a type. 1. We may apply it to the ascension of Christ
into heaven and the welcome given to him there. When he had finished his
work on earth he ascended in the clouds of heaven, [Dan
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md), [Dan
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014.md). The gates of heaven must then be
opened to him, those doors that may be truly called everlasting, which
had been shut against us, to keep the way of the tree of life, [Gen
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#024.md). Our Redeemer found them shut,
but, having by his blood made atonement for sin and gained a title to
enter into the holy place ([Heb 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012).md),
as one having authority, he demanded entrance, not for himself only, but
for us; for, as the forerunner, he has for us entered and opened the
kingdom of heaven to all believers. The keys not only of hell and death,
but of heaven and life, must be put into his hand. His approach being
very magnificent, the angels are brought in asking, Who is this King of
glory? For angels keep the gates of the New Jerusalem, [Rev
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#012.md). When the first-begotten was
brought into the upper world the angels were to worship him ([Heb
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006).md); and accordingly, they here ask
with wonder, "Who is he? - this that cometh with dyed garments from
Bozrah? ([Isa 63:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001).md), for he appears
in that world as a Lamb that had been slain." It is answered that he is
strong and mighty, mighty in battle, to save his people and subdue his
and their enemies. 2. We may apply it to Christ's entrance into the
souls of men by his word and Spirit, that they may be his temples.
Christ's presence in them is like that of the ark in the temple; it
sanctifies them. Behold, he stands at the door and knocks, [Rev
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#020.md). It is required that the gates
and doors of the heart be opened to him, not only as admission is given
to a guest, but as possession is delivered to the rightful owner, after
the title has been contested. This is the gospel call and demand, that
we let Jesus Christ, the King of glory, come into our souls, and welcome
him with hosannas, Blessed is he that cometh. That we may do this aright
we are concerned to ask, Who is this King of glory? - to acquaint
ourselves with him, whom we are to believe in, and to love above all.
And the answer is ready: He is Jehovah, and will be Jehovah our
righteousness, an all-sufficient Saviour to us, if we give him entrance
and entertainment. He is strong and mighty, and the Lord of hosts; and
therefore it is at our peril if we deny him entrance; for he is able to
avenge the affront; he can force his way, and can break those in pieces
with his iron rod that will not submit to his golden sceptre.

In singing this let our hearts cheerfully answer to this call, as it is
in the first words of the next psalm, Unto thee, O Lord! do I lift up my
soul.
