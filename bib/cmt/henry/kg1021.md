### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg1 21:0</span></span>

Ahab is still the unhappy subject of the sacred history; from the great
affairs of his camp and kingdom this chapter leads us into his garden,
and gives us an account of some ill things (and ill indeed they proved
to him) relating to his domestic affairs. I. Ahab is sick for Naboth's
vineyard ([Kg1 21:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#001).md). II. Naboth
dies by Jezebel's plot, that the vineyard may escheat to Ahab ([Kg1
21:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#005).md). III. Ahab goes to take
possession ([Kg1 21:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#015).md). IV. Elijah
meets him, and denounces the judgments of God against him for his
injustice ([Kg1 21:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#017).md). V. Upon his
humiliation a reprieve is granted ([Kg1
21:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#025).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 21:1</span></span>

Here is, 1. Ahab coveting his neighbour's vineyard, which unhappily lay
near his palace and conveniently for a kitchen-garden. Perhaps Naboth
had been pleased that he had a vineyard which lay so advantageously for
a prospect of the royal gardens, or the vending of its productions to
the royal family; but the situation of it proved fatal to him. If he had
had no vineyard, or it had lain obscure in some remote place, he would
have preserved his life. But many a man's possessions have been his
snare, and his neighbourhood to greatness has been of pernicious
consequence. Ahab sets his eye and heart on this vineyard, [Kg1
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#002.md). It will be a pretty addition to
his demesne, a convenient out-let to his palace; and nothing will serve
him but it must be his own. He is welcome to the fruits of it, welcome
to walk in it; Naboth perhaps would have made him a lease of it for his
life, to please him; but nothing will please him unless he have an
absolute property in it, he and his heirs for ever. Yet he is not such a
tyrant as to take it by force, but fairly proposes either to give Naboth
the full value of it in money or a better vineyard in exchange. He had
tamely quitted the great advantages God had given him of enlarging his
dominion for the honour of his kingdom, by his victory over the Syrians,
and now is eager to enlarge his garden, only for the convenience of his
house, as if to be penny wise would atone for being pound foolish. To
desire a convenience to his estate was not evil (there would be no
buying if there were no desire of what is bought; the virtuous woman
considers a field and buys it); but to desire any thing inordinately,
though we would compass it by lawful means, is a fruit of selfishness,
as if we must engross all the conveniences, and none must live, or live
comfortably, by us, contrary to the law of contentment, and the letter
of the tenth commandment, Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house. 2.
The repulse he met with in this desire. Naboth would by no means part
with it ([Kg1 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#003).md): The Lord forbid
it me; and the Lord did forbid it, else he would not have been so rude
and uncivil to his prince as not to gratify him in so small a matter.
Canaan was in a peculiar manner God's land; the Israelites were his
tenants; and this was one of the conditions of their leases, that they
should not alienate (no, not to one another) any part of that which fell
to their lot, unless in case of extreme necessity, and then only till
the year of jubilee, [Lev 25:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#028.md). Now
Naboth foresaw that, if his vineyard were sold to the crown, it would
never return to his heirs, no, not in the jubilee. He would gladly
oblige the king, but he must obey God rather than men, and therefore in
this matter desires to be excused. Ahab knew the law, or should have
known it, and therefore did ill to ask that which his subject could not
grant without sin. Some conceive that Naboth looked upon his earthly
inheritance as an earnest of his lot in the heavenly Canaan, and
therefore would not part with the former, lest it should amount to a
forfeiture of the latter. He seems to have been a conscientious man, who
would rather hazard the king's displeasure than offend God, and probably
was one of the 7000 that had not bowed the knee to Baal, for which, it
may be, Ahab owed him a grudge. 3. Ahab's great discontent and
uneasiness hereupon. He was as before ([Kg1
20:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#043)) heavy and displeased (v. 4.md),
grew melancholy upon it, threw himself upon his bed, would not eat nor
admit company to come to him. He could by no means digest the affront.
His proud spirit aggravated the indignity Naboth did him in denying him,
as a thing not to be suffered. He cursed the squeamishness of Naboth's
conscience, which he pretended to consult the peace of, and secretly
meditated revenge. Nor could he bear the disappointment; it cut him to
the heart to be crossed in his desires, and he was perfectly sick for
vexation. Note, (1.) Discontent is a sin that is its own punishment and
makes men torment themselves; it makes the spirit sad, the body sick,
and all the enjoyments sour; it is the heaviness of the heart and the
rottenness of the bones. (2.) It is a sin that is its own parent. It
arises not from the condition, but from the mind. As we find Paul
contented in a prison, so Ahab discontent in a palace. He had all the
delights of Canaan, that pleasant land, at command the wealth of a
kingdom, the pleasures of a court, and the honours and powers of a
throne; and yet all this avails him nothing without Naboth's vineyard.
Inordinate desires expose men to continual vexations, and those that are
disposed to fret, be they ever so happy, will always find something or
other to fret at.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 21:5</span></span>

Nothing but mischief is to be expected when Jezebel enters into the
story - that cursed woman, [Kg2 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#034.md).

I. Under pretence of comforting her afflicted husband, she feeds his
pride and passion, and blows the coals of his corruptions. It became her
to take notice of his grief and to enquire into the cause of it, [Kg1
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#005.md). Those have forgotten both the
duty and affection of the conjugal relation that interest not themselves
in each other's troubles. He told her what troubled him ([Kg1
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#006).md), yet invidiously concealed
Naboth's reason for his refusal, representing it as peevish, when it was
conscientious - I will not give it thee, whereas he said, I may not.
What! says Jezebel ([Kg1 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#007).md), Dost
thou govern Israel? Arise, and eat bread. She does well to persuade him
to shake off his melancholy, and not to sink under his burden, to be
easy and cheerful; whatever was his grief, grieving would not redress
it, but pleasantness would alleviate it. Her plea is, Dost thou now
govern Israel? This is capable of a good sense: "Does it become so great
a prince as thou art to cast thyself down for so small a matter? Thou
shamest thyself, and profanest thy crown; it is below thee to take
notice of so inconsiderable a thing. Art thou fit to govern Israel, who
hast no better a government of thy own passions? Or hast thou so rich a
kingdom at command and canst not thou be without this one vineyard?" We
should learn to quiet ourselves, under our crosses, with the thoughts of
the mercies we enjoy, especially our hopes of the kingdom. But she meant
it in a bad sense: "Dost thou govern Israel, and shall any subject thou
hast deny thee any thing thou hast a mind to? Art thou a king? It is
below thee to buy and pay, much more to beg and pray; use thy
prerogative, and take by force what thou canst not compass by fair
means; instead of resenting the affront thus, revenge it. If thou
knowest not how to support the dignity of a king, let me alone to do it;
give me but leave to make use of thy name, and I will soon give thee the
vineyard of Naboth; right or wrong, it shall be thy own shortly, and
cost thee nothing." Unhappy princes those are, and hurried apace towards
their ruin, who have those about them that stir them up to acts of
tyranny and teach them how to abuse their power.

II\. In order to gratify him, she projects and compasses the death of
Naboth. No less than his blood will serve to atone for the affront he
has given to Ahab, which she thirsts after the more greedily because of
his adherence to the law of the God of Israel.

1\. Had she aimed only at his land, her false witnesses might have sworn
him out of that by a forged deed (she could not have set up so weak a
title but the elders of Jezreel would have adjudged it good); but the
adulteress will hunt for the precious life, [Pro
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#026.md). Revenge is sweet. Naboth must
die, and die as a malefactor, to gratify it.

(1.) Never were more wicked orders given by any prince than those which
Jezebel sent to the magistrates of Jezreel, [Kg1
21:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#008.md). She borrows the privy-seal,
but the king shall not know what she will do with it. It is probable
this was not the first time he had lent it to her, but that with it she
had signed warrants for the slaying of the prophets. She makes use of
the king's name, knowing the thing would please him when it was done,
yet fearing he might scruple at the manner of doing it; in short, she
commands them, upon their allegiance, to put Naboth to death, without
giving them any reason for so doing. Had she sent witnesses to inform
against him, the judges (who must go secundum allegata et probata -
according to allegations and proofs) might have been imposed upon, and
their sentence might have been rather their unhappiness than their
crime; but to oblige them to find the witnesses, sons of Belial, to
suborn them themselves, and then to give judgment upon a testimony which
they knew to be false, was such an impudent defiance to every thing that
is just and sacred as we hope cannot be paralleled in any story. She
must have looked upon the elders of Jezreel as men perfectly lost to
every thing that is honest and honourable when she expected these orders
should be obeyed. But she will put them in a way how to do it, having as
much of the serpent's subtlety as she had of his poison. \[1.\] It must
be done under colour of religion: "Proclaim a fast; signify to your city
that you are apprehensive of some dreadful judgment coming upon you,
which you must endeavour to avert, not only by prayer, but by finding
out and by putting away the accursed thing; pretend to be afraid that
there is some great offender among you undiscovered, for whose sake God
is angry with your city; charge the people, if they know of any such, on
that solemn occasion to inform against him, as they regard the welfare
of the city; and at last let Naboth be fastened upon as the suspected
person, probably because he does not join with his neighbours in their
worship. This may serve for a pretence to set him on high among the
people, to call him to the bar. Let proclamation be made that, if any
one can inform the court against the prisoner, and prove him to be the
Achan, they shall be heard; and then let the witnesses appear to give
evidence against him." Note, There is no wickedness so vile, so horrid,
but religion has sometimes been made a cloak and cover for it. We must
not think at all the worse of fasting and praying for their having been
sometimes thus abused, but much the worse of those wicked designs that
have at any time been carried on under the shelter of them. \[2.\] It
must be done under colour of justice too, and with the formalities of a
legal process. Had she sent to them to hire some of their danbitti, some
desperate suffirans, to assassinate him, to stab him as he went along
the streets in the night, the deed would have been bad enough; but to
destroy him by a course of law, to use that power for the murdering of
the innocent which ought to be their protection, was such a violent
perversion of justice and judgment as was truly monstrous, yet such as
we are directed not to marvel at, [Ecc
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008.md). The crime they must lay to his
charge was blaspheming God and the king - a complicated blasphemy.
Surely she could not think to put a blasphemous sense upon the answer he
had given to Ahab, as if denying him his vineyard were blaspheming the
king, and giving the divine law for the reason were blaspheming God. No,
she pretends not any ground at all for the charge: though there was no
colour of truth in it, the witnesses must swear it, and Naboth must not
be permitted to speak for himself, or cross-examine the witnesses, but
immediately, under pretence of a universal detestation of the crime,
they must carry him out and stone him. His blaspheming God would be the
forfeiture of his life, but not of his estate, and therefore he is also
charged with treason, in blaspheming the king, for which his estate was
to be confiscated, that so Ahab might have his vineyard.

(2.) Never were wicked orders more wickedly obeyed than these were by
the magistrates of Jezreel. They did not so much as dispute the command
nor make any objections against it, though so palpably unjust, but
punctually observed all the particulars of it, either because they
feared Jezebel's cruelty or because they hated Naboth's piety, or both:
They did as it was written in the letters ([Kg1
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#011.md), [Kg1
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#012).md), neither made any difficulty of
it, nor met with any difficulty in it, but cleverly carried on the
villany. They stoned Naboth to death ([Kg1
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#013).md), and, as it should seem, his
sons with him, or after him; for, when God came to make inquisition for
blood, we find this article in the account ([Kg2
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#026).md), I have seen the blood of Naboth
and the blood of his sons. Perhaps they were secretly murdered, that
they might not claim their father's estate nor complain of the wrong
done him.

2\. Let us take occasion from this sad story, (1.) To stand amazed at
the wickedness of the wicked, and the power of Satan in the children of
disobedience. What a holy indignation may we be filled with to see
wickedness in the place of judgment! [Ecc
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016). (2..md) To lament the hard case of
oppressed innocency, and to mingle our tears with the tears of the
oppressed that have no comforter, while on the side of the oppressors
there is power, [Ecc 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001). (3..md) To
commit the keeping of our lives and comforts to God, for innocency
itself will not always be our security. (4.) To rejoice in the belief of
a judgment to come, in which such wrong judgments as these will be
called over. Now we see that there are just men to whom it happens
according to the work of the wicked ([Ecc
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014).md), but all will be set to rights
in the great day.

III\. Naboth being taken off, Ahab takes possession of his vineyard. 1.
The elders of Jezreel sent notice to Jezebel very unconcernedly, sent it
to her as a piece of agreeable news, Naboth is stoned and is dead, [Kg1
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#014.md). Here let us observe that, as
obsequious as the elders of Jezreel were to Jezebel's orders which she
sent from Samaria for the murder of Naboth, so obsequious were the
elders of Samaria afterwards to Jehu's orders which he sent from Jezreel
for the murder of Ahab's seventy sons, only that was not done by course
of law, [Kg2 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#006.md), [Kg2
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#007.md). Those tyrants that by their
wicked orders debauch the consciences of their inferior magistrates may
perhaps find at last the wheel return upon them, and that those who will
not stick to do one cruel thing for them will be as ready to do another
cruel thing against them. 2. Jezebel, jocund enough that her plot
succeeded so well, brings notice to Ahab that Naboth is not alive, but
dead; therefore, says she, Arise, take possession of his vineyard, [Kg1
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#015.md). He might have taken possession
by one of his officers, but so pleased is he with this accession to his
estate that he will make a journey to Jezreel himself to enter upon it;
and it should seem he went in state too, as if he had obtained some
mighty victory, for Jehu remembers long after that he and Bidkar
attended him at this time, [Kg2 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#025.md).
If Naboth's sons were all put to death, Ahab thought himself entitled to
the estate, ob defectum sanguinis - in default of heirs (as our law
expresses it); if not, yet, Naboth dying as a criminal, he claimed it ob
delictum criminis - as forfeited by his crime. Or, if neither would make
him a good title, the absolute power of Jezebel would give it to him,
and who would dare to oppose her will? Might often prevails against
right, and wonderful is the divine patience that suffers it to do so.
God is certainly of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, and yet for a
time keeps silence when the wicked devours the man that is more
righteous than he, [Hab 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#013.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 21:17</span></span>

In these verses we may observe,

I. The very bad character that is given of Ahab ([Kg1
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#025.md), [Kg1
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#026).md), which comes in here to justify
God in the heavy sentence passed upon him, and to show that though it
was passed upon occasion of his sin in the matter of Naboth (which
David's sin in the matter of Uriah did too much resemble), yet God would
not have punished him so severely if he had not been guilty of many
other sins, especially idolatry; whereas David, except in that one
matter, did that which was right. But, as to Ahab, there was none like
him, so ingenious and industrious in sin, and that made a trade of it.
He sold himself to work wickedness, that is, he made himself a perfect
slave to his lusts, and was as much at their beck and command as ever
any servant was at his master's. He was wholly given up to sin, and,
upon condition he might have the pleasures of it, he would take the
wages of it, which is death, [Rom
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#023.md). Blessed Paul complained that he
was sold under sin ([Rom 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014).md), as a
poor captive against his will; but Ahab was voluntary: he sold himself
to sin; of choice, and as his own act and deed, he submitted to the
dominion of sin. It was no excuse of his crimes that Jezebel his wife
stirred him up to do wickedly, and made him, in many respects, worse
than otherwise he would have been. To what a pitch of impiety did he
arrive who had such tinder of corruption in his heart and such a temper
in his bosom to strike fire into it! In many things he did ill, but he
did most abominably in following idols, like the Canaanites; his
immoralities were very provoking to God, but his idolatries were
especially so. Israel's case was sad when a prince of such a character
as this reigned over them.

II\. The message with which Elijah was sent to him, when he went to take
possession of Naboth's vineyard, [Kg1
21:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#017.md).

1\. Hitherto God kept silence, did not intercept Jezebel's letters, nor
stay the process of the elders of Jezreel; but now Ahab is reproved and
his sin set in order before his eyes. (1.) The person sent is Elijah. A
prophet of lower rank was sent with messages of kindness to him, [Kg1
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#013.md). But the father of the prophets
is sent to try him, and condemn him, for his murder. (2.) The place is
Naboth's vineyard and the time just when he is taking possession of it;
then, and there, must his doom be read him. By taking possession, he
avowed all that was done, and made himself guilty ex post facto - as an
accessary after the fact. There he was taken in the commission of the
errors, and therefore the conviction would come upon him with so much
the more force. "What hast thou to do in this vineyard? What good canst
thou expect from it when it is purchased with blood ([Hab
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#012).md) and thou hast caused the owner
thereof to lose his life?" [Job 31:39](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#039.md).
Now that he is pleasing himself with his ill-gotten wealth, and giving
direction for the turning of this vineyard into a flower-garden, his
meat in his bowels is turned. He shall not feel quietness. When he is
about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him,
[Job 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#014.md), [Job
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#020.md), [Job
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#023.md).

2\. Let us see what passed between him and the prophet.

(1.) Ahab vented his wrath against Elijah, fell into a passion at the
sight of him, and, instead of humbling himself before the prophet, as he
ought to have done ([Ch2 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#012).md), was
ready to fly in his face. Hast thou found me, O my enemy? [Kg1
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#020.md). This shows, \[1.\] That he
hated him. The last time we found them together they parted very good
friends, [Kg1 18:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#046.md). Then Ahab had
countenanced the reformation, and therefore then all was well between
him and the prophet; but now he had relapsed, and was worse than ever.
His conscience told him he had made God his enemy, and therefore he
could not expect Elijah should be his friend. Note, That man's condition
is very miserable that has made the word of God his enemy, and his
condition is very desperate that reckons the ministers of that word his
enemies because they tell him the truth, [Gal
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#016.md). Ahab, having sold himself to
sin, was resolved to stand to his bargain, and could not endure him that
would have helped him to recover himself, \[2.\] That he feared him:
Hast thou found me? intimating that he shunned him all he could, and it
was now a terror to him to see him. The sight of him was like that of
the handwriting upon the wall to Belshazzar; it made his countenance
change, the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one
against another. Never was poor debtor or criminal so confounded at the
sight of the officer that came to arrest him. Men may thank themselves
if they make God and his word a terror to them.

(2.) Elijah denounced God's wrath against Ahab: I have found thee (says
he, [Kg1 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#020).md), because thou hast
sold thyself to work evil. Note, Those that give up themselves to sin
will certainly be found out, sooner or later, to their unspeakable
horror and amazement. Ahab is now set to the bar, as Naboth was, and
trembles more than he did. \[1.\] Elijah finds the indictment against
him, and convicts him upon the notorious evidence of the fact ([Kg1
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#019).md): Hast thou killed, and also
taken possession? He was thus charged with the murder of Naboth, and it
would not serve him to say the law killed him (perverted justice is the
highest injustice), nor that, if he was unjustly prosecuted, it was not
his doing - he knew nothing of it; for it was to please him that it was
done, and he had shown himself pleased with it, and so had made himself
guilty of all that was done in the unjust prosecution of Naboth. He
killed, for he took possession. If he takes the garden, he takes the
guilt with it. Terra transit cum onere - The land with the incumbrance.
\[2.\] He passes judgment upon him. He told him from God that his family
should be ruined and rooted out ([Kg1
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#021).md) and all his posterity cut off,
- that his house should be made like the houses of his wicked
predecessors, Jeroboam and Baasha ([Kg1
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#022).md), particularly that those who
died in the city should be meat for dogs and those who died in the field
meat for birds ([Kg1 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#024).md), which had
been foretold of Jeroboam's house ([Kg1
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#011).md), and of Baasha's ([Kg1
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#004).md), - that Jezebel, particularly,
should be devoured by dogs ([Kg1
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#023).md), which was fulfilled ([Kg2
9:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#036).md), - and, as for Ahab himself,
that the dogs should lick his blood in the very same place where they
licked Naboth's ([Kg1 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#019.md) - "Thy
blood, even thine, though it be royal blood, though it swell thy veins
with pride and boil in thy heart with anger, shall ere long be an
entertainment for the dogs"), which was fulfilled, [Kg1
22:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#038.md). This intimates that he should
die a violent death, should come to his grave with blood, and that
disgrace should attend him, the foresight of which must needs be a great
mortification to such a proud man. Punishments after death are here most
insisted on, which, though such as affected the body only, were perhaps
designed as figures of the soul's misery after death.

III\. Ahab's humiliation under the sentence passed upon him, and the
favourable message sent him thereupon. 1. Ahab was a kind of penitent.
The message Elijah delivered to him in God's name put him into a fright
for the present, so that he rent his clothes and put on sackcloth, [Kg1
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#027.md). He was still a proud hardened
sinner, and yet thus reduced. Note, God can make the stoutest heart to
tremble and the proudest to humble itself. His word is quick and
powerful, and is, when the pleases to make it so, like a fire and a
hammer, [Jer 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#029.md). It made Felix
tremble. Ahab put on the garb and guise of a penitent, and yet his heart
was unhumbled and unchanged. After this, we find, he hated a faithful
prophet, [Kg1 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#008.md). Note, It is no new
thing to find the show and profession of repentance where yet the truth
and substance of it are wanting. Ahab's repentance was only what might
be seen of men: Seest thou (says God to Elijah) how Ahab humbles
himself; it was external only, the garments rent, but not the heart. A
hypocrite may go very far in the outward performance of holy duties and
yet come short. 2. He obtained hereby a reprieve, which I may call a
kind of pardon. Though it was but an outside repentance (lamenting the
judgment only, and not the sin), though he did not leave his idols, nor
restore the vineyard to Naboth's heirs, yet, because he did hereby give
some glory to God, God took notice of it, and bade Elijah take notice of
it: Seest thou how Ahab humbles himself? [Kg1
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#029.md). In consideration of this the
threatened ruin of his house, which had not been fixed to any time,
should be adjourned to his son's days. The sentence should not be
revoked, but the execution suspended. Now, (1.) This discovers the great
goodness of God, and his readiness to show mercy, which here rejoices
against judgment. Favour was shown to this wicked man that God might
magnify his goodness (says bishop Sanderson) even to the hazard of his
other divine perfections; as if (says he) God would be thought unholy,
or untrue, or unjust (though he be none of these), or any thing, rather
than unmerciful. (2.) This teaches us to take notice of that which is
good even in those who are not so good as they should be: let it be
commended as far as it goes. (3.) This gives a reason why wicked people
sometimes prosper long; God is rewarding their external services with
external mercies. (4.) This encourages all those that truly repent and
unfeignedly believe the holy gospel. If a pretending partial penitent
shall go to his house reprieved, doubtless a sincere penitent shall go
to his house justified.
