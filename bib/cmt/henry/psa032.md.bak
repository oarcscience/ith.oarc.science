### [Psalms Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 32:0</span></span>

This psalm, though it speaks not of Christ, as many of the psalms we
have hitherto met with have done, has yet a great deal of gospel in it.
The apostle tells us that David, in this psalm, describes "the
blessedness of the man unto whom God imputes righteousness without
words," [Rom 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#006.md). We have here a
summary, I. Of gospel grace in the pardon of sin ([Psa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md), [Psa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002).md), in divine protection ([Psa
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#007).md), and divine guidance ([Psa
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008).md). II. Of gospel duty. To confess
sin ([Psa 32:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#003).md), to pray ([Psa
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006).md), to govern ourselves well ([Psa
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#009.md), [Psa
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#010).md), and to rejoice in God ([Psa
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#011).md). The way to obtain these
privileges is to make conscience of these duties, which we ought to
think of - of the former for our comfort, of the latter for our
quickening, when we sing this psalm. Grotius thinks it was designed to
be sung on the day of atonement.

A psalm of David, Maschil.

[Psalms 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 32:1</span></span>

This psalm is entitled Maschil, which some take to be only the name of
the tune to which it was set and was to be sung. But others think it is
significant; our margin reads it, A psalm of David giving instruction,
and there is nothing in which we have more need of instruction than in
the nature of true blessedness, wherein it consists and the way that
leads to it - what we must do that we may be happy. There are several
things in which these verses instruct us. In general, we are here taught
that our happiness consists in the favour of God, and not in the wealth
of this world - in spiritual blessings, and not the good things of this
world. When David says ([Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001).md),
Blessed is the man that walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, and
([Psa 119:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#001).md), Blessed are the
undefiled in the way, the meaning is, "This is the character of the
blessed man; and he that has not this character cannot expect to be
happy:" but when it is here said, Blessed is the man whose iniquity is
forgiven, the meaning is, "This is the ground of his blessedness: this
is that fundamental privilege from which all the other ingredients of
his blessedness flow." In particular, we are here instructed,

I. Concerning the nature of the pardon of sin. This is that which we all
need and are undone without; we are therefore concerned to be very
solicitous and inquisitive about it. 1. It is the forgiving of
transgression. Sin is the transgression of the law. Upon our repentance,
the transgression is forgiven; that is, the obligation to punishment
which we lay under, by virtue of the sentence of the law, is vacated and
cancelled; it is lifted off (so some read it), that by the pardon of it
we may be eased of a burden, a heavy burden, like a load on the back,
that makes us stoop, or a load on the stomach, that makes us sick, or a
load on the spirits, that makes us sink. The remission of sins gives
rest and relief to those that were weary and heavily laden, [Mat
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028.md). 2. It is the covering of sin,
as nakedness is covered, that it may not appear to our shame, [Rev
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#018.md). One of the first symptoms of
guilt in our first parents was blushing at their own nakedness. Sin
makes us loathsome in the sight of God and utterly unfit for communion
with him, and, when conscience is awakened, it makes us loathsome to
ourselves too; but, when sin is pardoned, it is covered with the robe of
Christ's righteousness, like the coats of skins wherewith God clothed
Adam and Eve (an emblem of the remission of sins), so that God is no
longer displeased with us, but perfectly reconciled. They are not
covered from us (no; My sin is ever before me) nor covered from God's
omniscience, but from his vindictive justice. When he pardons sin he
remembers it no more, he casts it behind his back, it shall be sought
for and not found, and the sinner, being thus reconciled to God, begins
to be reconciled to himself. 3. It is the not imputing of iniquity, not
laying it to the sinner's charge, not proceeding against him for it
according to the strictness of the law, not dealing with him as he
deserves. The righteousness of Christ being imputed to us, and we being
made the righteousness of God in him, our iniquity is not imputed, God
having laid upon him the iniquity of us all and made him sin for us.
Observe, Not to impute iniquity is God's act, for he is the Judge. It is
God that justifies.

II\. Concerning the character of those whose sins are pardoned: in whose
spirit there is no guile. He does not say, "There is no guilt" (for who
is there that lives and sins not?), but no guile; the pardoned sinner is
one that does not dissemble with God in his professions of repentance
and faith, nor in his prayers for peace or pardon, but in all these is
sincere and means as he says - that does not repent with a purpose to
sin again, and then sin with a purpose to repent again, as a learned
interpreter glosses upon it. Those that design honestly, that are really
what they profess to be, are Israelites indeed, in whom is no guile.

III\. Concerning the happiness of a justified state: Blessednesses are
to the man whose iniquity is forgiven, all manner of blessings,
sufficient to make him completely blessed. That is taken away which
incurred the curse and obstructed the blessing; and then God will pour
out blessings till there be no room to receive them. The forgiveness of
sin is that article of the covenant which is the reason and ground of
all the rest. For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, [Heb
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#012.md).

IV\. Concerning the uncomfortable condition of an unhumbled sinner, that
sees his guilt, but is not yet brought to make a penitent confession of
it. This David describes very pathetically, from his own sad experience
([Psa 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#003.md), [Psa
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004).md): While I kept silence my bones
waxed old. Those may be said to keep silence who stifle their
convictions, who, when they cannot but see the evil of sin and their
danger by reason of it, ease themselves by not thinking of it and
diverting their minds to something else, as Cain to the building of a
city, - who cry not when God binds them, - who will not unburden their
consciences by a penitent confession, nor seek for peace, as they ought,
by faithful and fervent prayer, - and who choose rather to pine away in
their iniquities than to take the method which God has appointed of
finding rest for their souls. Let such expect that their smothered
convictions will be a fire in their bones, and the wounds of sin, not
opened, will fester, and grow intolerably painful. If conscience be
seared, the case is so much the more dangerous; but if it be startled
and awake, it will be heard. The hand of divine wrath will be felt lying
heavily upon the soul, and the anguish of the spirit will affect the
body; to the degree David experienced it, so that when he was young his
bones waxed old; and even his silence made him roar all the day long, as
if he had been under some grievous pain and distemper of body, when
really the cause of all his uneasiness was the struggle he felt in his
own bosom between his convictions and his corruptions. Note, He that
covers his sin shall not prosper; some inward trouble is required in
repentance, but there is much worse in impenitency.

V. Concerning the true and only way to peace of conscience. We are here
taught to confess our sins, that they may be forgiven, to declare them,
that we may be justified. This course David took: I acknowledged my sin
unto thee, and no longer hid my iniquity, [Psa
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005.md). Note, Those that would have the
comfort of the pardon of their sins must take shame to themselves by a
penitent confession of them. We must confess the fact of sin, and be
particular in it (Thus and thus have I done), confess the fault of sin,
aggravate it, and lay a load upon ourselves for it (I have done very
wickedly), confess the justice of the punishment we have been under for
it (The Lord is just in all that is brought upon us), and that we
deserve much worse - I am no more worthy to be called thy son. We must
confess sin with shame and holy blushing, with fear and holy trembling.

VI\. Concerning God's readiness to pardon sin to those who truly repent
of it: "I said, I will confess (I sincerely resolved upon it, hesitated
no longer, but came to a point, that I would make a free and ingenuous
confession of my sins) and immediately thou forgavest the iniquity of my
sin, and gavest me the comfort of the pardon in my own conscience;
immediately I found rest to my soul." Note, God is more ready to pardon
sin, upon our repentance, than we are to repent in order to the
obtaining of pardon. It was with much ado that David was here brought to
confess his sins; he was put to the rack before he was brought to do it
([Psa 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#003.md), [Psa
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004).md), he held out long, and would not
surrender till it came to the last extremity; but, when he did offer to
surrender, see how quickly, how easily, he obtained good terms: "I did
but say, I will confess, and thou forgavest." Thus the father of the
prodigal saw his returning son when he was yet afar off, and ran to meet
him with the kiss that sealed his pardon. What an encouragement is this
to poor penitents, and what an assurance does it give us that, if we
confess our sins, we shall find God, not only faithful and just, but
gracious and kind, to forgive us our sins!

VII\. Concerning the good use that we are to make of the experience
David had had of God's readiness to forgive his sins ([Psa
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006).md): For this shall every one that
is godly pray unto thee. Note, 1. All godly people are praying people.
As soon as ever Paul was converted, Behold, he prays, [Act
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#011.md). You may as soon find a living
man without breath as a living Christian without prayer. 2. The
instructions given us concerning the happiness of those whose sins are
pardoned, and the easiness of obtaining the pardon, should engage and
encourage us to pray, and particularly to pray, God be merciful to us
sinners. For this shall every one that is well inclined be earnest with
God in prayer, and come boldly to the throne of grace, with hopes to
obtain mercy, [Heb 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#016.md). 3. Those that
would speed in prayer must seek the Lord in a time when he will be
found. When, by his providence, he calls them to seek him, and by his
Spirit stirs them up to seek him, they must go speedily to seek the Lord
([Zac 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#021).md) and lose no time, lest
death cut them off, and then it will be too late to seek him, [Isa
55:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#006.md). Behold, now is the accepted
time, [Co2 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002.md), [Co2
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#004.md). Those that are sincere and
abundant in prayer will find the benefit of it when they are in trouble:
Surely in the floods of great waters, which are very threatening, they
shall not come nigh them, to terrify them, or create them any
uneasiness, much less shall they overwhelm them. Those that have God
nigh unto them in all that which they call upon him for, as all upright,
penitent, praying people have, are so guarded, so advanced, that no
waters - no, not great waters - no, not floods of them, can come nigh
them, to hurt them. As the temptations of the wicked one touch them not
([Jo1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018).md), so neither do the
troubles of this evil world; these fiery darts of both kinds, drop short
of them.

[Psalms 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 32:7</span></span>

David is here improving the experience he had had of the comfort of
pardoning mercy.

I. He speaks to God, and professes his confidence in him and expectation
from him, [Psa 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#007.md). Having tasted the
sweetness of divine grace to a penitent sinner, he cannot doubt of the
continuance of that grace to a praying saint, and that in that grace he
should find both safety and joy. 1. Safety: "Thou art my hiding-place;
when by faith I have recourse to thee I see all the reason in the world
to be easy, and to think myself out of the reach of any real evil. Thou
shalt preserve me from trouble, from the sting of it, and from the
strokes of it as far as is good for me. Thou shalt preserve me from such
trouble as I was in while I kept silence," [Psa
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#003.md). When God has pardoned our sins,
if he leaves us to ourselves, we shall soon run as far in debt again as
ever and plunge ourselves again into the same gulf; and therefore, when
we have received the comfort of our remission, we must fly to the grace
of God to be preserved from returning to folly again, and having our
hearts again hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. God keeps his
people from trouble by keeping them from sin. 2. Joy: "Thou shalt not
only deliver me, but compass me about with songs of deliverance; which
way soever I look I shall see occasion to rejoice and to praise God; and
my friends also shall compass me about in the great congregation, to
join with me in songs of praise: they shall join their songs of
deliverance with mine. As every one that is godly shall pray with me, so
they shall give thanks with me."

II\. He turns his speech to the children of men. Being himself
converted, he does what he can to strengthen his brethren ([Luk
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032).md): I will instruct thee, whoever
thou art that desirest instruction, and teach thee in the way which thou
shalt go, [Psa 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008.md). This, in another
of his penitential psalms, he resolves that when God should have
restored to him the joy of his salvation he would teach transgressors
his ways, and do what he could to convert sinners to God, as well as to
comfort those that were converted, [Psa
51:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#012.md), [Psa
51:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#013.md). When Solomon became a penitent
he immediately became a preacher, [Ecc
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001.md). Those are best able to teach
others the grace of God who have themselves had the experience of it:
and those who are themselves taught of God ought to tell others what he
has done for their souls ([Psa 66:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#016).md)
and so teach them. I will guide thee with my eye. Some apply this to
God's conduct and direction. He teaches us by his word and guides us
with his eye, by the secret intimations of his will in the hints and
turns of Providence, which he enables his people to understand and take
direction from, as a master makes a servant know his mind by a wink of
his eye. When Christ turned and looked upon Peter he guided him with his
eye. But it is rather to be taken as David's promise to those who sat
under his instruction, his own children and family especially: "I will
counsel thee; my eye shall be upon thee" (so the margin reads it); "I
will give thee the best counsel I can and then observe whether thou
takest it or no." Those that are taught in the word should be under the
constant inspection of those that teach them; spiritual guides must be
overseers. In this application of the foregoing doctrine concerning the
blessedness of those whose sins are pardoned we have a word to sinners
and a word to saints; and this is rightly dividing the word of truth and
giving to each their portion.

1\. Here is a word of caution to sinners, and a good reason is given for
it. (1.) The caution is, not to be unruly and ungovernable: Be you not
as the horse and the mule, which have no understanding, [Psa
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#009.md). When the psalmist would reproach
himself for the sins he repented of he compared himself to a beast
before God (so foolish have I been and ignorant, [Psa
73:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#022).md) and therefore warns others not
to be so. It is our honour and happiness that we have understanding,
that we are capable of being governed by reason and of reasoning with
ourselves. Let us therefore use the faculties we have, and act
rationally. The horse and mule must be managed with bit and bridle, lest
they come near us, to do us a mischief, or (as some read it) that they
may come near to us, to do us service, that they may obey us, [Jam
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#003.md). Let us not be like them; let us
not be hurried by appetite and passion, at any time, to go contrary to
the dictate of right reason and to our true interest. If sinners would
be governed and determined by these, they would soon become saints and
would not go a step further in their sinful courses; where there is
renewing grace there is no need of the bit and bridle of restraining
grace. (2.) The reason for this caution is because the way of sin which
we would persuade you to forsake will certainly end in sorrow ([Psa
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#010).md): Many sorrows shall be to the
wicked, which will not only spoil their vain and carnal mirth, and put
an end to it, but will make them pay dearly for it. Sin will have
sorrow, if not repented of, everlasting sorrow. It was part of the
sentence, I will greatly multiply thy sorrows. "Be wise for yourselves
therefore, and turn from your wickedness, that you may prevent those
sorrows, those many sorrows."

2\. Here is a word of comfort to saints, and a good reason is given for
that too. (1.) They are assured that if they will but trust in the Lord,
and keep closely to him, mercy shall compass them about on every side
([Psa 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#010).md), so that they shall not
depart from God, for that mercy shall keep them in, nor shall any real
evil break in upon them, for that mercy shall keep it out. (2.) They are
therefore commanded to be glad in the Lord, and to rejoice in him, to
such a degree as even to shout for joy, [Psa
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#011.md). Let them be so transported with
this holy joy as not to be able to contain themselves; and let them
affect others with it, that they also may see that a life of communion
with God is the most pleasant and comfortable life we can live in this
world. This is that present bliss which the upright in heart, and they
are only, are entitled to and qualified for.
