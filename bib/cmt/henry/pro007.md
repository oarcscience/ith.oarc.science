### [Proverbs Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">pro 7:0</span></span>

The scope of this chapter is, as of several before, to warn young men
against the lusts of the flesh. Solomon remembered of what ill
consequence it was to his father, perhaps found himself, and perceived
his son, addicted to it, or at least had observed how many hopeful young
men among his subjects had been ruined by those lusts; and therefore he
thought he could never say enough to dissuade men from them, that "every
one may possess his vessel in sanctification and honour, and not in the
lusts of uncleanness." In this chapter we have, I. A general exhortation
to get our minds principled and governed by the world of God, as a
sovereign antidote against this sin ([Pro
7:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#001).md). II. A particular
representation of the great danger which unwary young men are in of
being inveigled into this snare (v. 6-23). III. A serious caution
inferred thence, in the close, to take heed of all approaches towards
this sin ([Pro 7:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#024).md). We should all
pray, "Lord, lead us not into this temptation."

[Proverbs 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 7:1</span></span>

These verses are an introduction to his warning against fleshly lusts,
much the same with that, [Pro 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#020.md),
etc., and ending ([Pro 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#005).md) as that
did ([Pro 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#024).md), To keep thee from the
strange woman; that is it he aims at; only there he had said, Keep thy
father's commandment, here (which comes all to one), Keep my
commandments, for he speaks to us as unto sons. He speaks in God's name;
for it is God's commandments that we are to keep, his words, his law.
The word of God must be to us, 1. As that which we are most careful of.
We must keep it as our treasure; we must lay up God's commandments with
us, lay them up safely, that we may not be robbed of them by the wicked
one, [Pro 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#001.md). We must keep it as our
life: Keep my commandments and live ([Pro
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#002).md), not only, "Keep them, and you
shall live;" but, "Keep them as you would your life, as those that
cannot live without them." It would be death to a good man to be
deprived of the word of God, for by it he lives, and not by bread alone.
2. As that which we are most tender of: Keep my law as the apple of thy
eye. A little thing offends the eye, and therefore nature has so well
guarded it. We pray, with David, that God would keep us as the apple of
his eye ([Psa 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008).md), that our lives
and comforts may be precious in his sight; and they shall be so ([Zac
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008).md) if we be in like manner tender of
his law and afraid of the least violation of it. Those who reproach
strict and circumspect walking, as needless preciseness, consider not
that the law is to be kept as the apple of the eye, for indeed it is the
apple of our eye; the law is light; the law in the heart is the eye of
the soul. 3. As that which we are proud of and would be ever mindful of
([Pro 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#003).md): "Bind them upon thy
fingers; let them be precious to thee; look upon them as an ornament, as
a diamond-ring, as the signet on thy right hand; wear them continually
as thy wedding-ring, the badge of thy espousals to God. Look upon the
word of God as putting an honour upon thee, as an ensign of thy dignity.
Bind them on thy fingers, that they may be constant memorandums to thee
of thy duty, that thou mayest have them always in view, as that which is
graven upon the palms of thy hands." 4. As that which we are fond of and
are ever thinking of: Write them upon the table of thy heart, as the
names of the friends we dearly love, we say, are written in our hearts.
let the word of God dwell richly in us, and be written there where it
will be always at hand to be read. Where sin was written ([Jer
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001).md) let the word of God be written.
It is the matter of a promise ([Heb
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010.md), I will write my law in their
hearts), which makes the precept practicable and easy. 5. As that which
we are intimately acquainted and conversant with ([Pro
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#004).md): "Say unto wisdom, Thou art my
sister, whom I dearly love and take delight in; and call understanding
thy kinswoman, to whom thou art nearly allied, and for whom thou hast a
pure affection; call her thy friend, whom thou courtest." We must make
the word of God familiar to us, consult it, and consult its honour, and
take a pleasure in conversing with it. 6. As that which we make use of
for our defence and armour, to keep us from the strange woman, from sin,
that flattering but destroying thing, that adulteress; particularly from
the sin of uncleanness, [Pro 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#005.md). Let
the word of God confirm our dread of that sin and our resolutions
against it; let it discover to us its fallacies and suggest to us
answers to all its flatteries.

[Proverbs 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 7:6</span></span>

Solomon here, to enforce the caution he had given against the sin of
whoredom, tells a story of a young man that was ruined to all intents
and purposes by the enticements of an adulterous woman. Such a story as
this would serve the lewd profane poets of our age to make a play of,
and the harlot with them would be a heroine; nothing would be so
entertaining to the audience, nor give them so much diversion, as her
arts of beguiling the young gentleman and drawing in the country squire;
her conquests would be celebrated as the triumphs of wit and love, and
the comedy would conclude very pleasantly; and every young man that saw
it acted would covet to be so picked up. Thus fools make a mock at sin.
But Solomon here relates it, and all wise and good men read it, as a
very melancholy story. The impudence of the adulterous woman is very
justly looked upon, by all that have any sparks of virtue in them, with
the highest indignation, and the easiness of the young man with the
tenderest compassion; and the story concludes with sad reflections,
enough to make all that read and hear it afraid of the snares of fleshly
lusts and careful to keep at the utmost distance from them. It is
supposed to be a parable, or imagined case, but I doubt it was too true,
and, which is worse, that notwithstanding the warning it gives of the
fatal consequences of such wicked courses it is still too often true,
and the agents for hell are still playing the same game and with similar
success.

Solomon was a magistrate, and, as such, inspected the manners of his
subjects, looked often through his casement, that he might see with his
own eyes, and made remarks upon those who little thought his eye was
upon them, that he might know the better how to make the sword he bore a
terror to evil-doers. But here he writes as a minister, a prophet, who
is by office a watchman, to give warning of the approach of the enemies,
and especially where they lie in ambush, that we may not be ignorant of
Satan's devices, but may know where to double our guard. This Solomon
does here, where we may observe the account he gives,

I. Of the person tempted, and how he laid himself open to the
temptation, and therefore must thank himself if it end in his
destruction. 1. He was a young man, [Pro
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#007.md). Fleshly lusts are called youthful
lusts ([Ti2 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#022).md), not to extenuate
them as tricks of youth, and therefore excusable, but rather to
aggravate them, as robbing God of the first and best of our time, and,
by debauching the mind when it is tender, laying a foundation for a bad
life ever after, and to intimate that young people ought in a special
manner to fortify their resolutions against this sin. 2. He was a young
man void of understanding, that went abroad into the world, not
principled as he ought to have been with wisdom and the fear of God, and
so ventured to sea without ballast, without pilot, cord, or compass; he
knew not how to depart from evil, which is the best understanding, [Job
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028.md). Those become an easy prey to
Satan who, when they have arrived to the stature of men, have scarcely
the understanding of children. 3. He kept bad company. He was a young
man among the youths, a silly young man among the simple ones. If, being
conscious of his own weakness, he had associated with those that were
older and wiser than himself, there would have been hopes of him.
Christ, at twelve years old, conversed with the doctors, to set young
people an example of this. But, if those that are simple choose such for
their companions as are like themselves, simple they will still be, and
hardened in their simplicity. 4. He was sauntering, and had nothing to
do, but passed through the street as one that knew not how to dispose of
himself. One of the sins of filthy Sodom was abundance of idleness, [Eze
16:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#049.md). He went in a starched stately
manner, so (it is said) the word signifies. He appeared to be a nice
formal fop, the top of whose accomplishments was to dress well and walk
with a good air; fit game for that bird of prey to fly at. 5. He was a
night-walker, that hated and scorned the business that is to be done by
day-light, from which the evening calls men in to their repose; and,
having fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, he begins to
move in the twilight in the evening, [Pro
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#009.md). And he chooses the black and dark
night as fittest for his purpose, not the moonlight nights, when he
might be discovered. 6. He steered his course towards the house of one
that he thought would entertain him, and that he might be merry with; he
went near her corner, the way to her house ([Pro
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#008).md), contrary to Solomon's advice
([Pro 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#008).md), Come not night the door of
her house. Perhaps he did not know it was the way to an infamous house,
but, however, it was a way that he had no business in; and when we have
nothing to do the devil will quickly find us something to do. We must
take heed, not only of idle days, but of idle evenings, lest they prove
inlets to temptation.

II\. Of the person tempting, not a common prostitute, for she was a
married wife ([Pro 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#019).md), and, for
aught that appears, lived in reputation among her neighbours, not
suspected of any such wickedness, and yet, in the twilight of the
evening, when her husband was abroad, abominably impudent. She is here
described, 1. By her dress. She had the attire of a harlot ([Pro
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#010).md), gaudy and flaunting, to set her
off as a beauty; perhaps she was painted as Jezebel, and went with her
neck and breasts bare, loose, and en deshabille. The purity of the heart
will show itself in the modesty of the dress, which becomes women
professing godliness. 2. By her craft and management. She is subtle of
heart, mistress of all the arts of wheedling, and knowing how by all her
caresses to serve her own base purposes. 3. By her temper and carriage.
She is loud and stubborn, talkative and self-willed, noisy and
troublesome, wilful and headstrong, all tongue, and will have her
saying, right or wrong, impatient of check and control, and cannot bear
to be counselled, much less reproved, by husband or parents, ministers
or friends. She is a daughter of Belial, that will endure no yoke. 4. By
her place, not her own house; she hates the confinement and employment
of that; her feet abide not there any longer than needs must. She is all
for gadding abroad, changing place and company. Now is she without in
the country, under pretence of taking the air, now in the streets of the
city, under pretence of seeing how the market goes. She is here, and
there, and every where but where she should be. She lies in wait at
every corner, to pick up such as she can make a prey of. Virtue is a
penance to those to whom home is a prison.

III\. Of the temptation itself and the management of it. She met the
young spark. Perhaps she knew him; however she knew by his fashions that
he was such a one as she wished for; so she caught him about the neck
and kissed him, contrary to all the rules of modesty ([Pro
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#013).md), and waited not for his
compliments or courtship, but with an impudent face invited him not only
to her house, but to her bed.

1\. She courted him to sup with her ([Pro
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#014.md), [Pro
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#015).md): I have peace-offerings with me.
Hereby she gives him to understand, (1.) Her prosperity, that she was
compassed about with so many blessings that she had occasion to offer
peace-offerings, in token of joy and thankfulness; she was before-hand
in the world, so that he needed not fear having his pocket picked. (2.)
Her profession of piety. She had been today at the temple, and was as
well respected there as any that worshipped in the courts of the Lord.
She had paid her vows, and, as she thought, made all even with God
Almighty, and therefore might venture upon a new score of sins. Note,
The external performances of religion, if they do not harden men against
sin, harden them in it, and embolden carnal hearts to venture upon it,
in hopes that when they come to count and discount with God he will be
found as much in debt to them for their peace-offerings and their vows
as they to him for their sins. But it is sad that a show of piety should
become the shelter of iniquity (which really doubles the shame of it,
and makes it more exceedingly sinful) and that men should baffle their
consciences with those very things that should startle them. The
Pharisees made long prayers, that they might the more plausibly carry on
their covetous and mischievous provisions. The greatest part of the
flesh of the peace-offerings was by the law returned back to the
offerers, to feast upon with their friends, which (if they were
peace-offerings of thanksgiving) was to be all eaten the same day and
none of it left until the morning, [Lev
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#015.md). This law of charity and
generosity is abused to be a colour for gluttony and excess: "Come,"
says she, "come home with me, for I have good cheer enough, and only
want good company to help me off with it." It was a pity that the
peace-offerings should thus become, in a bad sense, sin-offerings, and
that what was designed for the honour of God should become the food and
fuel of a base lust. But this is not all. (4.) To strengthen the
temptation, \[1.\] She pretends to have a very great affection for him
above any man: "Therefore, because I have a good supper upon the table,
I came forth to meet thee, for no friend in the world shall be so
welcome to it as thou shalt, [Pro
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#015.md). Thou art he whom I came on
purpose to seek, to seek diligently, came myself, and would not send a
servant." Surely he cannot deny her his company when she put such a
value upon it, and would take all this pains to obtain the favour of it.
Sinners take pains to do mischief, and are as the roaring lion himself;
they go about seeking to devour, and yet pretend they are seeking to
oblige. \[2.\] She would have it thought that Providence itself
countenanced her choice of him for her companion; for how quickly had
she found him whom she sought!

2\. She courted him to lie with her. They will sit down to eat and
drink, and then rise up to play, to play the wanton, and there is a bed
ready for them, where he shall find that which will be in all respects
agreeable to him. To please his eye, it is decked with coverings of
tapestry and carved works, exquisitely fine; he never saw the like. To
please his touch, the sheets are not of home-spun cloth; they are
far-fetched and dear bought; they are of fine linen of Egypt, [Pro
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#016.md). To gratify his smell, it is
perfumed with the sweetest scents, [Pro
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#017.md). Come, therefore, and let us take
our fill of love, [Pro 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#018.md). Of love,
does she say? Of lust she means, brutish lust; but it is a pity that the
name of love should be thus abused. True love is from heaven; this is
from hell. How can those pretend to solace themselves and love one
another who are really ruining themselves and one another?

3\. She anticipated the objection which he might make of the danger of
it. Is she not another man's wife, and what if her husband should catch
them in adultery, in the very act? he will make them pay dearly for
their sport, and where will the solace of their love be then? "Never
fear," says she, "the good man is not at home" ([Pro
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#019).md); she does not call him her
husband, for she forsakes the guide of her youth and forgets the
covenant of her God; but "the good man of the house, whom I am weary
of." Thus Potiphar's wife, when she spoke of her husband, would not call
him so, but he, [Gen 39:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#014.md). It is
therefore with good reason taken notice of, to Sarah's praise, that she
spoke respectfully of her husband, calling him lord. She pleases herself
with this that he is not at home, and therefore she is melancholy if she
have not some company, and therefore whatever company she has she may be
free with them, for she is from under his eye, and he shall never know.
But will he not return quickly? No: "he has gone a long journey, and
cannot return on a sudden; he appointed the day of his return, and he
never comes home sooner than he says he will. He has taken a bag of
money with him, either," (1.) "To trade with, to buy goods with and he
will not return till he has laid it all out. It is a pity that an honest
industrious man should be thus abused, and advantage taken of his
absence, when it is upon business, for the good of his family." Or, (2.)
"To spend and revel with." Whether justly or not, she insinuates that he
was a bad husband; so she would represent him, because she was resolved
to be a bad wife, and must have that for an excuse; it is often
groundlessly suggested, but is never a sufficient excuse. "He follows
his pleasures, and wastes his estate abroad" (says she), "and why should
not I do the same at home?"

IV\. Of the success of the temptation. Promising the young man every
thing that was pleasant, and impunity in the enjoyment, she gained her
point, [Pro 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#021.md). It should seem, the
youth, though very simple, had no ill design, else a word, a beck, a
wink, would have served, and there would have been no need of all this
harangue; but though he did not intend any such thing, nay, had
something in his conscience that opposed it, yet with her much fair
speech she caused him to yield. His corruptions at length triumphed over
his convictions, and his resolutions were not strong enough to hold out
against such artful attacks as these, but with the flattery of her lips
she forced him; he could not stop his ear against such a charmer, but
surrendered himself her captive. Wisdom's maidens, who plead her cause,
and have reason on their side, and true and divine pleasures to invite
men to, have a deaf ear turned to them, and with all their rhetoric
cannot compel men to come in, but such is the dominion of sin in the
hearts of men that its allurements soon prevail by falsehood and
flattery. With what pity does Solomon here look upon this foolish young
man, when he sees him follow the adulterous woman! (1.) He gives him up
for gone; alas! he is undone. he goes to the slaughter (for houses of
uncleanness are slaughter-houses to precious souls); a dart will
presently strike through his liver; going without his breast-plate, he
will receive his death's wound, [Pro
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#023.md). It is his life, his precious
life, that is thus irrecoverably thrown away, he is perfectly lost to
all good; his conscience is debauched; a door is opened to all other
vices, and this will certainly end in his endless damnation. (2.) That
which makes his case the more piteous is that he is not himself aware of
his misery and danger; he goes blindfold, nay, he goes laughing to his
ruin. The ox thinks he is led to the pasture when he is led to the
slaughter; the fool (that is, the drunkard, for, of all sinners,
drunkards are the greatest fools) is led to the correction of the
stocks, and is not sensible of the shame of it, but goes to it as if he
were going to a play. The bird that hastes to the snare looks only at
the bait, and promises herself a good bit from that, and considers not
that it is for her life. Thus this unthinking unwary young man dreams of
nothing but the pleasures he shall have in the embraces of the harlot,
while really he is running headlong upon his ruin. Though Solomon does
not here tell us that he put the law in execution against this base
harlot, yet we have no reason to think but that he did, he was himself
so affected with the mischief she did and had such an indignation at it.

[Proverbs 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 7:24</span></span>

We have here the application of the foregoing story: "Hearken to me
therefore, and not to such seducers ([Pro
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#024).md); give ear to a father, and not
to an enemy." 1. "Take good counsel when it is given you. Let not thy
heart decline to her ways ([Pro 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#025).md);
never leave the paths of virtue, though strait and narrow, solitary and
up-hill, for the way of the adulteress, though green, and broad, and
crowded with company. Do not only keep thy feet from those ways, but let
not so much as thy heart incline to them; never harbour a disposition
this way, nor think otherwise than with abhorrence of such wicked
practices as these. Let reason, and conscience, and the fear of God
ruling in the heart, check the inclinations of the sensual appetite. If
thou goest in her paths, in any of the paths that lead to this sin, thou
goest astray, thou art out of the right way, the safe way; therefore
take heed, go not astray, lest thou wander endlessly." 2. "Take fair
warning when it is given you." (1.) "Look back, and see what mischief
this sin has done. The adulteress has been the ruin not of here and
there one, but she has cast down many wounded." Thousands have been
undone, now and for ever, by this sin; and those not only the weak and
simple youths, such as he was of whom he had now spoken, but many strong
men have been slain by her, [Pro 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#026.md).
Herein, perhaps, he has an eye especially to Samson, who was slain by
this sin, and perhaps to David too, who by this sin entailed a sword
upon his house, though so far the Lord took it away that he himself
should not die. These were men not only of great bodily strength, but of
eminent wisdom and courage, and yet their fleshly lusts prevailed over
them. Howl, fir-trees, if the cedars be shaken. Let him that thinks he
stands take heed lest he fall. (2.) "Look forward with an eye of faith,
and see what will be in the end of it," [Pro
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#027.md). Her house, though richly decked
and furnished, and called a house of pleasure, is the way to hell; and
her chambers are the stair-case that goes down to the chambers of death
and everlasting darkness. The cup of fornication must shortly be
exchanged for the cup of trembling; and the flames of lust, if not
quenched by repentance and mortification, will burn to the lowest hell.
Therefore stand in awe and sin not.
