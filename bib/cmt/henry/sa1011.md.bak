### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 11:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have the first-fruits of Saul's government, in the
glorious rescue of Jabesh-Gilead out of the hands of the Ammonites. Let
not Israel thence infer that therefore they did well to ask a king (God
could and would have saved them without one); but let them admire God's
goodness, that he did not reject them when they rejected him, and
acknowledge his wisdom in the choice of the person whom, if he did not
find fit, yet he made fit, for the great trust he called him to, and
enabled, in some measure, to merit the crown by his public services,
before it was fixed on his head by the public approbation. Here is, I.
The great extremity to which the city of Jabesh-Gilead, on the other
side of Jordan, was reduced by the Ammonites ([Sa1
11:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001).md). II. Saul's great readiness to
come to their relief, whereby he signalized himself ([Sa1
11:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#004).md). III. The good success of his
attempt, by which God signalized him ([Sa1
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#011).md). IV. Saul's tenderness,
notwithstanding this, towards those that had opposed him ([Sa1
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#012.md), [Sa1
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#013).md). V. The public confirmation and
recognition of his election to the government ([Sa1
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#014.md), [Sa1
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#015).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 11:1</span></span>

The Ammonites were bad neighbours to those tribes of Israel that lay
next them, though descendants from just Lot, and, for that reason, dealt
civilly with by Israel. See [Deu 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#019.md).
Jephthah, in his time, had humbled them, but now the sin of Israel had
put them into a capacity to make head again, and avenge that quarrel.
The city of Jabesh-Gilead had been, some ages ago, destroyed by Israel's
sword of justice, for not appearing against the wickedness of Gibeah
([Jdg 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#010).md); and now being
replenished again, probably by the posterity of those that then escaped
the sword, it is in danger of being destroyed by the Ammonites, as if
some bad fate attended the place. Nahash, king of Ammon ([Ch1
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#001).md) laid siege to it. Now here,

I. The besieged beat a parley ([Sa1
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001).md): "Make a covenant with us, and
we will surrender upon terms, and serve thee." They had lost the virtue
of Israelites, else they would not have thus lost the valour of
Israelites, nor tamely yielded to serve an Ammonite, without one bold
struggle for themselves. Had they not broken their covenant with God,
and forsaken his service, they needed not thus to have courted a
covenant with a Gentile nation, and offered themselves to serve them.

II\. The besiegers offer them base and barbarous conditions; they will
spare their lives, and take them to be their servants, upon condition
that they shall put out their right eyes, [Sa1
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#002.md). The Gileadites were content to
part with their liberty and estates for the ransom of their blood; and,
had the Ammonites taken them at their word, the matter would have been
so settled immediately, and the Gileadites would not have sent out for
relief. But their abject concessions make the Ammonites more insolent in
their demands, and they cannot be content to have them for their
servants, but, 1. They must torment them, and put them to pain,
exquisite pain, for so the thrusting out of an eye would do. 2. They
must disable them for war, and render them incapable, though not of
labour (that would have been a loss to their lords), yet of bearing
arms; for in those times they fought with shields in their left hands,
which covered their left eye, so that a soldier without his right eye
was in effect blind. 3. They must put a reproach upon all Israel, as
weak and cowardly, that would suffer the inhabitants of one of their
chief cities to be thus miserably used, and not offer to rescue them.

III\. The besieged desire, and obtain, seven days' time to consider of
this proposal, [Sa1 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#003.md). If Nahash
had not granted them this respite, we may suppose the horror of the
proposal would have made them desperate, and they would rather have died
with their swords in their hands than have surrendered to such merciless
enemies: therefore Nahash, not imagining it possible that, in so short a
time, they should have relief, and being very secure of the advantages
he thought he had against them, in a bravado gave them seven days, that
the reproach upon Israel, for not rescuing them, might be the greater,
and his triumphs the more illustrious. But there was a providence in it,
that his security might be his infatuation and ruin.

IV\. Notice is sent of this to Gibeah. They said they would send
messengers to all the coasts of Israel ([Sa1
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#003).md), which made Nahash the more
secure, for that, he thought, would be a work of time, and none would be
forward to appear if they had not one common head; and perhaps Nahash
had not yet heard of the new-elected king. But the messengers, either of
their own accord or by order from their masters, went straight to
Gibeah, and, not finding Saul within, told their news to the people, who
fell a weeping upon hearing it, [Sa1
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#004.md). They would sooner lament their
brethren's misery and danger than think of helping them, shed their
tears for them than shed their blood. They wept, as despairing to help
the men of Jabesh-Gilead, and fearing lest, if that frontier-city should
be lost, the enemy would penetrate into the very bowels of their
country, which now appeared in great hazard.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 11:5</span></span>

What is here related turns very much to the honour of Saul, and shows
the happy fruits of that other spirit with which he was endued. Observe
here,

I. His humility. Though he was anointed king, and accepted by his
people, yet he did not think it below him to know the state of his own
flocks, but went himself to see them, and came in the evening, with his
servants, after the herd out of the field, [Sa1
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#005.md). This was an evidence that he was
not puffed up with his advancement, as those are most apt to be that are
raised from a mean estate. Providence had not yet found him business as
a king; he left all to Samuel; and therefore, rather than be idle, he
would, for the present, apply himself to his country business again.
Though the sons of Belial would, perhaps, despise him the more for it,
such as were virtuous and wise, and loved business themselves, would
think never the worse of him. He had no revenues settled upon him for
the support of his dignity, and he was desirous not to be burdensome to
the people, for which reason, like Paul, he worked with his hands; for,
if he neglect his domestic affairs, how must he maintain himself and his
family? Solomon gives it as a reason why men should look well to their
herds because the crown doth not endure to every generation, [Pro
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#023.md), [Pro
27:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#024.md). Saul's did not; he must
therefore provide something surer.

II\. His concern for his neighbours. When he perceived them in tears, he
asked, "What ails the people that they weep? Let me know, that, if it be
a grievance which can be redressed, I may help them, and that, if not, I
may weep with them." Good magistrates are in pain if their subjects are
in tears.

III\. His zeal for the safety and honour of Israel. When he heard of the
insolence of the Ammonites, and the distress of a city, a mother in
Israel, the Spirit of God came upon him, and put great thoughts into his
mind, and his anger was kindled greatly, [Sa1
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#006.md). He was angry at the insolence of
the Ammonites, angry at the mean and sneaking spirit of the men of
Jabesh-Gilead, angry that they had not sent him notice sooner of the
Ammonites' descent and the extremity they were likely to be reduced to.
He was angry to see his neighbours weeping, when it was fitter for them
to be preparing for war. It was a brave and generous fire that was now
kindled in the breast of Saul, and such as became his high station.

IV\. The authority and power he exerted upon this important occasion. He
soon let Israel know that, though he had retired to his privacy, he had
a care for the public, and knew how to command men into the field, as
well as how to drive cattle out of the field, [Sa1
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#005.md), [Sa1
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#007.md). He sent a summons to all the
coasts of Israel, to show the extent of his power beyond his own tribe,
even to all the tribes, and ordered all the military men forthwith to
appear in arms at a general rendezvous in Bezek. Observe, 1. His
modesty, in joining Samuel in commission with himself. He would not
execute the office of a king without a due regard to that of a prophet.
2. His mildness in the penalty threatened against those that should
disobey his orders. He hews a yoke of oxen in pieces, and sends the
pieces to the several cities of Israel, threatening, with respect to him
who should decline the public service, not, "Thus shall it be done to
him," but, "Thus shall it be done to his oxen." God had threatened it as
a great judgment ([Deu 28:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#031).md), Thy ox
shall be slain before thy eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof. It was
necessary that the command should be enforced with some penalty, but
this was not nearly so severe as that which was affixed to a similar
order by the whole congregation, [Jdg
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#005.md). Saul wished to show that his
government was more gentle than that which they had been under. The
effect of this summons was that the militia, or trained bands, of the
nation, came out as one man, and the reason given is, because the fear
of the Lord fell upon them. Saul did not affect to make them fear him,
but they were influenced to observe his orders by the fear of God and a
regard to him who had made Saul their king and them members one of
another. Note, Religion and the fear of God will make men good subjects,
good soldiers, and good friends to the public interests of the country.
Those that fear God will make conscience of their duty to all men,
particularly to their rulers.

V. His prudent proceedings in this great affair, [Sa1
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#008.md). He numbered those that came in
to him, that he might know his own strength, and how to distribute his
forces in the best manner their numbers would allow. It is the honour of
princes to know the number of their men, but it is the honour of the
King of kings that there is not any number of his armies, [Job
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#003.md). In this muster, it seems, Judah,
though numbered by itself, made no great figure; for, as it was one
tribe of twelve, so it was but an eleventh part of the whole number,
30,330, though the rendezvous was at Bezek, in that tribe. They wanted
the numbers, or the courage, or the zeal for which that tribe used to be
famous; so low was it, just before the sceptre was brought into it in
David.

VI\. His faith and confidence, and (grounded thereon) his courage and
resolution, in this enterprise. It should seem that those very
messengers who brought the tidings from Jabesh-Gilead Saul sent into the
country to raise the militia, who would be sure to be faithful and
careful in their own business, and them he now sends back to their
distressed countrymen, with this assurance (in which, it is probable,
Samuel encouraged him): "Tomorrow, by such an hour, before the enemy can
pretend that the seven days have expired, you shall have deliverance,
[Sa1 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#009.md). Be you ready to do your
part, and we will not fail to do ours. Do you sally out upon the
besiegers, while we surround them." Saul knew he had a just cause, a
clear call, and God on his side, and therefore doubted not of success.
This was good news to the besieged Gileadites, whose right eyes had wept
themselves dry for their calamities, and now began to fail with looking
for relief and to ache in expectation of the doom of the ensuing day,
when they must look their last; the greater the exigence the more
welcome the deliverance. When they heard it they were glad, relying on
the assurances that were sent to them. And they sent into the enemies'
camp ([Sa1 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#010).md) to tell them that
next day they would be ready to meet them, which the enemies understood
as an intimation that they despaired of relief, and so were made the
more secure by it. If they took not care, by sending out scouts, to
rectify their own mistake, they must thank themselves if they were
surprised: the besieged were under no obligation to give them notice of
the help they were assured of.

VII\. His industry and close application to this business. If he had
been bred up to war from his youth, and had led regiments as often as he
had followed droves, he could not have gone about an affair of this
nature more dexterously nor more diligently. When the Spirit of the Lord
comes upon men it will make them expert even without experience. A vast
army (especially in comparison with the present usage) Saul had now at
his foot, and a long march before him, nearly sixty miles, and over
Jordan too. No cavalry in his army, but all infantry, which he divides
into three battalions, [Sa1 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#011.md). And
observe, 1. With what incredible swiftness he flew to the enemy. In a
day and a night he came to the place of action, where his own fate, and
that of Israel, must be determined. He had passed his word, and would
not break it; nay, he was better than his word, for he promised help
next day, by that time the sun was hot ([Sa1
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#009).md), but brought it before day, in
the morning-watch, [Sa1 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#011.md). Whom
God helps he helps right early, [Psa
46:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#005.md). 2. With what incredible bravery
he flew upon the enemy. Betimes in the morning, when they lay dreaming
of the triumphs they expected that day over the miserable inhabitants of
Jabesh-Gilead, before they were aware he was in the midst of their host;
and his men, being marched against them in three columns, surrounded
them on every side, so that they could have neither heart nor time to
make head against them.

Lastly, To complete his honour, God crowned all these virtues with
success. Jabesh-Gilead was rescued, and the Ammonites were totally
routed; he had now the day before him to complete his victory in, and so
complete a victory it was that those who remained, after a great
slaughter, were scattered so that two of them were not left together to
encourage or help one another, [Sa1
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#011.md). We may suppose that Saul was
the more vigorous in this matter, 1. Because there was some alliance
between the tribe of Benjamin and the city of Jabesh-Gilead. That city
had declined joining with the rest of the Israelites to destroy Gibeah,
which was then punished as their crime, but perhaps was now remembered
as their kindness, when Saul of Gibeah came with so much readiness and
resolution to relieve Jabesh-Gilead. Yet that was not all; two-thirds of
the Benjamites that then remained were provided with wives from that
city ([Jdg 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#014).md), so that most of the
mothers of Benjamin were daughters of Jabesh-Gilead, for which city
Saul, being a Benjamite, had therefore a particular kindness; and we
find they returned his kindness, [Sa1
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#011.md), [Sa1
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#012.md). 2. Because it was the
Ammonites' invasion that induced the people to desire a king (so Samuel
says, [Sa1 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#012).md), so that if he had
not done his part, in this expedition, he would have disappointed their
expectations, and for ever forfeited their respect.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 11:12</span></span>

We have here the improvement of the glorious victory which Saul had
obtained, not the improvement of it abroad, though we take it for
granted that the men of Jabesh-Gilead, having so narrowly saved their
right eyes, would with them now discern the opportunity they had of
avenging themselves upon these cruel enemies and disabling them from
ever straitening them in like manner again; now shall they be avenged on
the Ammonites for their right eyes condemned, as Samson on the
Philistines for his two eyes put out, [Jdg
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#028.md). But the account here given is
of the improvement of this victory at home.

I. The people took this occasion to show their jealousy for the honour
of Saul, and their resentment of the indignities done him. Samuel, it
seems, was present, if not in the action (it was too far for him to
march) yet to meet them when they returned victorious; and to him, as
judge, the motion was made (for they knew Saul would not be judge in his
own cause) that the sons of Belial that would not have him to reign over
them should be brought forth and slain, [Sa1
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#012.md). Saul's good fortune (as foolish
men commonly call it) went further with them to confirm his title than
either his choice by lot or Samuel's anointing him. They had not courage
thus to move for the prosecution of those that opposed him when he
himself looked mean, but, now that his victory made him look great,
nothing would serve but they must be put to death.

II\. Saul took this occasion to give further proofs of his clemency,
for, without waiting for Samuel's answer, he himself quashed the motion
([Sa1 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#013).md): There shall not a man be
put to death this day, no, not those men, those bad men, that had abused
him, and therein reflected on God himself, 1. Because it was a day of
joy and triumph: "To day the Lord has wrought salvation in Israel; and,
since God has been so good to us all, let us not be harsh one to
another. Now that God has made the heart of Israel in general so glad,
let not us make sad the hearts of any particular Israelites." 2. Because
he hoped they were by this day's work brought to a better temper, were
now convinced that this man, under God, could save them, now honoured
him whom before they had despised; and, if they are but reclaimed, he is
secured from receiving any disturbance by them, and therefore his point
is gained. If an enemy be made a friend, that will be more to our
advantage than to have him slain. And all good princes consider that
their power is for edification, not for destruction.

III\. Samuel took this occasion to call the people together before the
Lord in Gilgal, [Sa1 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#014.md), [Sa1
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#015.md). 1. That they might publicly
give God thanks for their late victory. There they rejoiced greatly,
and, that God might have the praise of that which they had the comfort
of, they sacrificed to him, as the giver of all their successes,
sacrifices of peace-offerings. 2. That they might confirm Saul in the
government, more solemnly than had been yet done, that he might not
retire again to his obscurity. Samuel would have the kingdom renewed; he
would renew his resignation, and the people should renew their
approbation, and so in concurrence with, or rather in attendance upon,
the divine nomination, they made Saul king, making it their own act and
deed to submit to him.
