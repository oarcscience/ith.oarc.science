### [Psalms Chapter 50](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 50:0</span></span>

This psalm, as the former, is a psalm of instruction, not of prayer or
praise; it is a psalm of reproof and admonition, in singing which we are
to teach and admonish one another. In the foregoing psalm, after a
general demand of attention, God by his prophet deals ([Psa
50:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#003).md) with the children of this world,
to convince them of their sin and folly in setting their hearts upon the
wealth of this world; in this psalm, after a like preface, he deals with
those that were, in profession, the church's children, to convince them
of their sin and folly in placing their religion in ritual services,
while they neglected practical godliness; and this is as sure a way to
ruin as the other. This psalm is intended, 1. As a proof to the carnal
Jews, both those that rested in the external performances of their
religion, and were remiss in the more excellent duties of prayer and
praise, and those that expounded the law to others, but lived wicked
lives themselves. 2. As a prediction of the abolishing of the ceremonial
law, and of the introducing of a spiritual way of worship in and by the
kingdom of the Messiah, [Joh 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#023.md),
[Joh 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024.md). 3. As a representation of
the day of judgment, in which God will call men to an account concerning
their observance of those things which they have thus been taught; men
shall be judged "according to what is written in the books;" and
therefore Christ is fitly represented speaking as a Judge, then when he
speaks as a Lawgiver. Here is, I. The glorious appearance of the Prince
that gives law and judgment ([Psa
50:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001).md). II. Instruction given to his
worshippers, to turn their sacrifices into prayers ([Psa
50:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#007).md). III. A rebuke to those that
pretend to worship God, but live in disobedience to his commands ([Psa
50:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016).md), their doom read ([Psa
50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021.md), [Psa
50:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#022).md), and warning given to all to
look to their conversation as well as to their devotions ([Psa
50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023).md). These instructions and
admonitions we must take to ourselves, and give to one another, in
singing this psalm.

A psalm of Asaph.

[Psalms 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 50:1</span></span>

It is probable that Asaph was not only the chief musician, who was to
put a tune to this psalm, but that he was himself the penman of it; for
we read that in Hezekiah's time they praised God in the words of David
and of Asaph the seer, [Ch2 29:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#030.md).
Here is,

I. The court called, in the name of the King of kings ([Psa
50:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#002).md): The mighty God, even the Lord,
hath spoken - El, Elohim, Jehovah, the God of infinite power justice and
mercy, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. God is the Judge, the Son of God
came for judgement into the world, and the Holy Ghost is the Spirit of
judgment. All the earth is called to attend, not only because the
controversy God had with his people Israel for their hypocrisy and
ingratitude might safely be referred to any man of reason (nay, let the
house of Israel itself judge between God and his vineyard, [Isa
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#003).md), but because all the children of
men are concerned to know the right way of worshipping God, in spirit
and in truth, because when the kingdom of the Messiah should be set up
all should be instructed in the evangelical worship, and invited to join
in it (see [Mal 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011.md), [Act
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034).md), and because in the day of
final judgment all nations shall be gathered together to receive their
doom, and every man shall give an account of himself unto God.

II\. The judgment set, and the Judge taking his seat. As, when God gave
the law to Israel in the wilderness, it is said, He came from Sinai, and
rose up from Seir, and shone forth from Mount Paran, and came with ten
thousands of his saints, and then from his right hand went a fiery law
([Deu 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002).md), so, with allusion to
that, when God comes to reprove them for their hypocrisy, and to send
forth his gospel to supersede the legal institutions, it is said here,
1. That he shall shine out of Zion, as then from the top of Sinai, [Psa
50:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#002.md). Because in Zion his oracle was
now fixed, thence his judgments upon that provoking people denounced,
and thence the orders issued for the execution of them ([Joe
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001).md): Blow you the trumpet in Zion.
Sometimes there are more than ordinary appearances of God's presence and
power working with and by his word and ordinances, for the convincing of
men's consciences and the reforming and refining of his church; and then
God, who always dwells in Zion, may be said to shine out of Zion.
Moreover, he may be said to shine out of Zion because the gospel, which
set up spiritual worship, was to go forth from Mount Zion ([Isa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003.md), [Mic
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#002).md), and the preachers of it were to
begin at Jerusalem ([Luk 24:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047).md), and
Christians are said to come unto Mount Zion, to receive their
instructions, [Heb 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022.md), [Heb
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#028.md). Zion is here called the
perfection of beauty, because it was the holy hill; and holiness is
indeed the perfection of beauty. 2. That he shall come, and not keep
silence, shall no longer seem to wink at the sins of men, as he had done
([Psa 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021).md), but shall show his
displeasure at them, and shall also cause that mystery to be published
to the world by his holy apostles which had long lain hid, that the
Gentiles should be fellow-heirs ([Eph
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#005.md), [Eph
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#006).md) and that the partition-wall of
the ceremonial law should be taken down; this shall now no longer be
concealed. In the great day our God shall come and shall not keep
silence, but shall make those to hear his judgment that would not
hearken to his law. 3. That his appearance should be very majestic and
terrible: A fire shall devour before him. The fire of his judgments
shall make way for the rebukes of his word, in order to the awakening of
the hypocritical nation of the Jews, that the sinners in Zion, being
afraid of that devouring fire ([Isa
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014).md), might be startled out of their
sins. When his gospel kingdom was to be set up Christ came to send fire
on the earth, [Luk 12:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#049.md). The Spirit
was given in cloven tongues as of fire, introduced by a rushing mighty
wind, which was very tempestuous, [Act
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#002.md), [Act
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#003.md). And in the last judgment Christ
shall come in flaming fire, [Th2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#008.md).
See [Dan 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md); [Heb
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#027.md). 4. That as on Mount Sinai he
came with ten thousands of his saints, so he shall now call to the
heavens from above, to take notice of this solemn process ([Psa
50:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#004).md), as Moses often called heaven
and earth to witness against Israel ([Deu
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#026.md), [Deu
31:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#028.md), [Deu
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#001).md), and God by his prophets, [Isa
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002.md); [Mic
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#002.md). The equity of the judgment of the
great day will be attested and applauded by heaven and earth, by saints
and angels, even all the holy myriads.

III\. The parties summoned ([Psa
50:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#005).md): Gather my saints together unto
me. This may be understood either, 1. Of saints indeed: "Let them be
gathered to God through Christ; let the few pious Israelites be set by
themselves;" for to them the following denunciations of wrath do not
belong; rebukes to hypocrites ought not to be terrors to the upright.
When God will reject the services of those that only offered sacrifice,
resting in the outside of the performance, he will graciously accept
those who, in sacrificing, make a covenant with him, and so attend to
and answer the end of the institution of sacrifices. The design of the
preaching of the gospel, and the setting up of Christ's kingdom, was to
gather together in one the children of God, [Joh
11:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#052.md). And at the second coming of
Jesus Christ all his saints shall be gathered together unto him ([Th2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001).md) to be assessors with him in the
judgment; for the saints shall judge the world, [Co1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#002.md). Now it is here given as a
character of the saints that they have made a covenant with God by
sacrifice. Note, (1.) Those only shall be gathered to God as his saints
who have, in sincerity, covenanted with him, who have taken him to be
their God and given up themselves to him to be his people, and thus have
joined themselves unto the Lord. (2.) It is only by sacrifice, by Christ
the great sacrifice (from whom all the legal sacrifices derived what
value they had), that we poor sinners can covenant with God so as to be
accepted of him. There must be an atonement made for the breach of the
first covenant before we can be admitted again into covenant. Or, 2. It
may be understood of saints in profession, such as the people of Israel
were, who are called a kingdom of priests and a holy nation, [Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006.md). They were, as a body politic,
taken into covenant with God, the covenant of peculiarity; and it was
done with great solemnity, by sacrifice, [Exo
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#008.md). "Let them come and hear what God
has to say to them; let them receive the reproofs God sends them now by
his prophets, and the gospel he will, in due time, send them by his Son,
which shall supersede the ceremonial law. If these be slighted, let them
expect to hear from God another way, and to be judged by that word which
they will not be ruled by."

IV\. The issue of this solemn trial foretold ([Psa
50:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#006).md): The heavens shall declare his
righteousness, those heavens that were called to be witnesses to the
trial ([Psa 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#004).md); the people in
heaven shall say, Hallelujah. True and righteous are his judgments, [Rev
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001.md), [Rev
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#002.md). The righteousness of God in all
the rebukes of his word and providence, in the establishment of his
gospel (which brings in an everlasting righteousness, and in which the
righteousness of God is revealed), and especially in the judgment of the
great day, is what the heavens will declare; that is, 1. It will be
universally known, and proclaimed to all the world. As the heavens
declare the glory, the wisdom and power, of God the Creator ([Psa
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001).md), so they shall no less openly
declare the glory, the justice and righteousness, of God the Judge; and
so loudly do they proclaim both that there is no speech nor language
where their voice is not heard, as it follows there, [Psa
50:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#003.md). 2. It will be incontestably
owned and proved; who can deny what the heavens declare? Even sinners'
own consciences will subscribe to it, and hell as well as heaven will be
forced to acknowledge the righteousness of God. The reason given is, for
God is Judge himself, and therefore, (1.) He will be just; for it is
impossible he should do any wrong to any of his creatures, he never did,
nor ever will. When men are employed to judge for him they may do
unjustly; but, when he is Judge himself, there can be no injustice done.
Is God unrighteous, who takes vengeance? The apostle, for this reason,
startles at the thought of it; God forbid! for then how shall God judge
the world? [Rom 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005.md), [Rom
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#006.md). These decisions will be perfectly
just, for against them there will lie no exception, and from them there
will lie no appeal. (2.) He will be justified; God is Judge, and
therefore he will not only execute justice, but he will oblige all to
own it; for he will be clear when he judges, [Psa
51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004.md).

[Psalms 50:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 50:7</span></span>

God is here dealing with those that placed all their religion in the
observances of the ceremonial law, and thought those sufficient.

I. He lays down the original contract between him and Israel, in which
they had avouched him to be their God, and he them to be his people, and
so both parties were agreed ([Psa
50:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#007).md): Hear, O my people! and I will
speak. Note, It is justly expected that whatever others doe, when he
speaks, his people should give ear; who will, if they do not? And then
we may comfortably expect that God will speak to us when we are ready to
hear what he says; even when he testifies against us in the rebukes and
threatenings of his word and providences we must be forward to hear what
he says, to hear even the rod and him that has appointed it.

II\. He puts a slight upon the legal sacrifices, [Psa
50:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008.md), etc. Now,

1\. This may be considered as looking back to the use of these under the
law. God had a controversy with the Jews; but what was the ground of the
controversy? Not their neglect of the ceremonial institutions; no, they
had not been wanting in the observance of them, their burnt-offerings
had been continually before God, they took a pride in them, and hoped by
their offerings to procure a dispensation for their lusts, as the
adulterous woman, [Pro 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#014.md). Their
constant sacrifices, they thought, would both expiate and excuse their
neglect of the weightier matters of the law. Nay, if they had, in some
degree, neglected these institutions, yet that should not have been the
cause of God's quarrel with them, for it was but a small offence in
comparison with the immoralities of their conversation. They thought God
was mightily beholden to them for the many sacrifices they had brought
to his altar, and that they had made him very much their debtor by them,
as if he could not h have maintained his numerous family of priests
without their contributions; but God here shows them the contrary, (1.)
That he did not need their sacrifices. What occasion had he for their
bullocks and goats who has the command of all the beasts of the forest,
and the cattle upon a thousand hills ([Psa
50:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#009.md), [Psa
50:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#010).md), has an incontestable propriety
in them and dominion over them, has them all always under his eye and
within his reach, and can make what use he pleases of them; they all
wait on him, and are all at his disposal? [Psa
104:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#027.md). Can we add any thing to his
store whose all the wild fowl and wild beasts are, the world itself and
the fulness thereof? [Psa 50:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#011.md), [Psa
50:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#012.md). God's infinite self-sufficiency
proves our utter insufficiency to add any thing to him. (2.) That he
could not be benefited by their sacrifices. Their goodness, of this
kind, could not possibly extend to him, nor, if they were in this matter
righteous, was he the better ([Psa
50:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#013).md): Will I eat the flesh of bulls?
It is as absurd to think that their sacrifices could, of themselves, and
by virtue of any innate excellency in them, add any pleasure of praise
to God, as it would be to imagine that an infinite Spirit could be
supported by meat and drink, as our bodies are. It is said indeed of the
demons whom the Gentiles worshipped that they did eat the fat of their
sacrifices, and drink the wine of their drink-offerings ([Deu
32:38](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#038).md): they regaled themselves in the
homage they robbed the true God of; but will the great Jehovah be thus
entertained? No; to obey is better than sacrifice, and to love God and
our neighbour better than all burnt-offerings, so much better that God
by his prophets often told them that their sacrifices were not only not
acceptable, but abominable, to him, while they lived in sin; instead of
pleasing him, he looked upon them as a mockery, and therefore an affront
and provocation to him; see [Pro 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#008.md);
[Isa 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011.md), etc.; [Isa
66:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#003.md); [Jer
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#020.md); [Amo
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#021.md). They are therefore here warned
not to rest in these performances; but to conduct themselves, in all
other instances, towards God as their God.

2\. This may be considered as looking forward to the abolishing of these
by the gospel of Christ. Thus Dr. Hammond understands it. When God shall
set up the kingdom of the Messiah he shall abolish the old way of
worship by sacrifice and offerings; he will no more have those to be
continually before him ([Psa 50:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008).md); he
will no more require of his worshippers to bring him their bullocks and
their goats, to be burnt upon his altar, [Psa
50:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#009.md). For indeed he never appointed
this as that which he had any need of, or took any pleasure in, for,
besides that all we have is his already, he has far more beasts in the
forest and upon the mountains, which we know nothing of nor have any
property in, than we have in our folds; but he instituted it to
prefigure the great sacrifice which his own Son should in the fulness of
time offer upon the cross, to make atonement for sin, and all the other
spiritual sacrifices of acknowledgment with which God, through Christ,
will be well pleased.

III\. He directs to the best sacrifices of prayer and praise as those
which, under the law, were preferred before all burnt-offerings and
sacrifices, and on which then the greatest stress was laid, and which
now, under the gospel, come in the room of those carnal ordinances which
were imposed until the times of reformation. He shows us here ([Psa
50:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#014.md), [Psa
50:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#015).md) what is good, and what the Lord
our God requires of us, and will accept, when sacrifices are slighted
and superseded. 1. We must make a penitent acknowledgment of our sins:
Offer to God confession, so some read it, and understand it of the
confession of sin, in order to our giving glory to God and taking shame
to ourselves, that we may never return to it. A broken and contrite
heart is the sacrifice which God will not despise, [Psa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#017.md). If the sin was not abandoned
the sin-offering was not accepted. 2. We must give God thanks for his
mercies to us: Offer to God thanksgiving, every day, often every day
(seven times a day will I praise thee), and upon special occasions; and
this shall please the Lord, if it come from a humble thankful heart,
full of love to him and joy in him, better than an ox or bullock that
has horns and hoofs, [Psa 69:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#030.md), [Psa
69:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#031.md). 3. We must make conscience of
performing our covenants with him: Pay thy vows to the Most High,
forsake thy sins, and do thy duty better, pursuant to the solemn
promises thou has made him to that purport. When we give God thanks for
any mercy we have received we must be sure to pay the vows we made to
him when we were in the pursuit of the mercy, else our thanksgivings
will not be accepted. Dr. Hammond applies this to the great gospel
ordinance of the eucharist, in which we are to give thanks to God for
his great love in sending his Son to save us, and to pay our vows of
love and duty to him, and to give alms. Instead of all the Old Testament
types of a Christ to come, we have that blessed memorial of a Christ
already come. 4. In the day of distress we must address ourselves to God
by faithful and fervent prayer ([Psa
50:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#015).md): Call upon me in the day of
trouble, and not upon any other god. Our troubles, though we see them
coming from God's hand, must drive us to him, and not drive us from him.
We must thus acknowledge him in all our ways, depend upon his wisdom,
power, and goodness, and refer ourselves entirely to him, and so give
him glory. This is a cheaper, easier, readier way of seeking his favour
than by a peace-offering, and yet more acceptable. 5. When he, in answer
to our prayers, delivers us, as he has promised to do in such way and
time as he shall think fit, we must glorify him, not only by a grateful
mention of his favour, but by living to his praise. Thus must we keep up
our communion with God, meeting him with our prayers when he afflicts us
and with our praises when he delivers us.

[Psalms 50:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 50:16</span></span>

God, by the psalmist, having instructed his people in the right way of
worshipping him and keeping up their communion with him, here directs
his speech to the wicked, to hypocrites, whether they were such as
professed the Jewish or the Christian religion: hypocrisy is wickedness
for which God will judge. Observe here,

I. The charge drawn up against them. 1. They are charged with invading
and usurping the honours and privileges of religion ([Psa
50:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016).md): What has thou to do, O wicked
man! to declare my statutes? This is a challenge to those that rare
really profane, but seemingly godly, to show what title they have to the
cloak of religion, and by what authority they wear it, when they use it
only to cover and conceal the abominable impieties of their hearts and
lives. Let them make out their claim to it if they can. Some think it
points prophetically at the scribes and Pharisees that were the teachers
and leaders of the Jewish church at the time when the kingdom of the
Messiah, and that evangelical way of worship spoken of in the foregoing
verses, were to be set up. They violently opposed that great revolution,
and used all the power and interest which they had by siting in Moses's
seat to hinder it; but the account which our blessed Saviour gives of
them (Mt. 23), and St. Paul ([Rom
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#021.md), [Rom
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#022).md), makes this expostulation here
agree very well to them. They took on them to declare God's statues, but
they hated Christ's instruction; and therefore what had they to do to
expound the law, when they rejected the gospel? But it is applicable to
all those that are practicers of iniquity, and yet professors of piety,
especially if withal they be preachers of it. Note, It is very absurd in
itself, and a great affront to the God of heaven, for those that are
wicked and ungodly to declare his statutes and to take his covenant in
their mouths. It is very possible, and too common, for those that
declare God's statutes to others to live in disobedience to them
themselves, and for those that take God's covenant in their mouths yet
in their hearts to continue their covenant with sin and death; but they
are guilty of a usurpation, they take to themselves an honour which they
have no title to, and there is a day coming when they will be thrust out
as intruders. Friend, how camest thou in hither? 2. They are charged
with transgressing and violating the laws and precepts of religion. (1.)
They are charged with a daring contempt of the word of God ([Psa
50:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#017).md): Thou hatest instruction. They
loved to give instruction, and to tell others what they should do, for
this fed their pride and made them look great, and by this craft they
got their living; but they hated to receive instruction from God
himself, for that would be a check upon them and a mortification to
them. "Thou hatest discipline, the reproofs of the word and the rebukes
of Providence." No wonder that those who hate to be reformed hate the
means of reformation. Thou castest my words behind thee. They seemed to
set God's words before them, when they sat in Moses's seat, and
undertook to teach others out of the law ([Rom
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#019).md); but in their conversations they
cast God's word behind them, and did not care for seeing that rule which
they were resolved not to be ruled by. This is despising the commandment
of the Lord. (2.) A close confederacy with the worst of sinners ([Psa
50:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#018).md): "When thou sawest a thief,
instead of reproving him and witnessing against him, as those should do
that declare God's statutes, thou consentedst with him, didst approve of
his practices, and desire to be a partner with him and to share in the
profits of his cursed trade; and thou hast been partaker with
adulterers, hast done as they did, and encouraged them to go on in their
wicked courses, hast done these things and hast had pleasure in those
that do them," [Rom 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#032). (3..md) A
constant persisting in the worst of tongue-sins ([Psa
50:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#019).md): "Thou givest thy mouth to
evil, not only allowest thyself in, but addictest thyself wholly to, all
manner of evil-speaking." \[1.\] Lying: Thy tongue frames deceit, which
denotes contrivance and deliberation in lying. It knits or links deceit,
so some. One lie begets another, and one fraud requires another to cover
it. \[2.\] Slandering ([Psa 50:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#020).md):
"Thou sittest, and speakest against thy brother, dost basely abuse and
misrepresent him, magisterially judge and censure him, and pass sentence
upon him, as if you wert his master to whom he must stand or fall,
whereas he is thy brother, as good as thou art, and upon the level with
thee, for he is thy own mother's son. He is thy near relation, whom thou
oughtest to love, to vindicate, and stand up for, if others abused him;
yet thou dost thyself abuse him, whose faults thou oughtest to cover and
make the best of; if really he had done amiss, yet thou dost most
falsely and unjustly charge him with that which he is innocent of; thou
sittest and doest this, as a judge upon the bench, with authority; thou
sittest in the seat of the scornful, to deride and backbite those whom
thou oughtest to respect and be kind to." Those that do ill themselves
commonly delight in speaking ill of others.

II\. The proof of this charge ([Psa
50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021).md): "These things thou hast done;
the fact is too plain to be denied, the fault too bad to be excused;
these things God knows, and thy own heart knows, thou hast done." The
sins of sinners will be proved upon them, beyond contradiction, in the
judgment of the great day: "I will reprove thee, or convince thee, so
that thou shalt have not one word to say for thyself." The day is coming
when impenitent sinners will have their mouths for ever stopped and be
struck speechless. What confusion will they be filled with when God
shall set their sins in order before their eyes! They would not see
their sins to their humiliation, but cast them behind their backs,
covered them, and endeavoured to forget them, nor would they suffer
their own consciences to put them in mind of them; but the day is coming
when God will make them see their sins to their everlasting shame and
terror; he will set them in order, original sin, actual sins, sins
against the law, sins against the gospel, against the first table,
against the second table, sins of childhood and youth, of riper age, and
old age. He will set them in order, as the witnesses are set in order,
and called in order, against the criminal, and asked what they have to
say against him.

III\. The Judge's patience, and the sinner's abuse of that patience: "I
kept silence, did not give thee any disturbance in thy sinful way, but
let thee alone to take thy course; sentence against thy evil works was
respited, and not executed speedily." Note, The patience of God is very
great towards provoking sinners. He sees their sins and hates them; it
would be neither difficulty nor damage to him to punish them, and yet he
waits to be gracious and gives them space to repent, that he may render
them inexcusable if they repent not. His patience is the more wonderful
because the sinner makes such an ill use of it: "Thou thoughtest that I
was altogether such a one as thyself, as weak and forgetful as thyself,
as false to my word as thyself, nay, as much a friend to sin as
thyself." Sinners take God's silence for consent and his patience for
connivance; and therefore the longer they are reprieved the more are
their hearts hardened; but, if they turn not, they shall be made to see
their error when it is too late, and that the God they provoke is just,
and holy, and terrible, and not such a one as themselves.

IV\. The fair warning given of the dreadful doom of hypocrites ([Psa
50:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#022).md): "Now consider this, you that
forget God, consider that God knows and keeps account of all your sins,
that he will call you to an account for them, that patience abused will
turn into the greater wrath, that though you forget God and your duty to
him he will not forget you and your rebellions against him: consider
this in time, before it be too late; for if these things be not
considered, and the consideration of them improved, he will tear you in
pieces, and there will be none to deliver." It is the doom of hypocrites
to be cut asunder, [Mat 24:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#051.md). Note,
1. Forgetfulness of God is at the bottom of all the wickedness of the
wicked. Those that know God, and yet do not obey him, do certainly
forget him. 2. Those that forget God forget themselves; and it will
never be right with them till they consider, and so recover themselves.
Consideration is the first step towards conversion. 3. Those that will
not consider the warnings of God's word will certainly be torn in pieces
by the executions of his wrath. 4. When God comes to tear sinners in
pieces, there is no delivering them out of his hand. They cannot deliver
themselves, nor can any friend they have in the world deliver them.

V. Full instructions given to us all how to prevent this fearful doom.
Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter; we have it, [Psa
50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023.md), which directs us what to do
that we may attain our chief end. 1. Man's chief end is to glorify God,
and we are here told that whoso offers praise glorifies him; whether he
be Jew or Gentile, those spiritual sacrifices shall be accepted from
him. We must praise God, and we must sacrifice praise, direct it to God,
as every sacrifice was directed; put it into the hands of the priest,
our Lord Jesus, who is also the altar; see that it be made by fire,
sacred fire, that it be kindled with the flame of holy and devout
affection; we must be fervent in spirit, praising the Lord. This he is
pleased, in infinite condescension, to interpret as glorifying him.
Hereby we give him the glory due to his name and do what we can to
advance the interests of his kingdom among men. 2. Man's chief end, in
conjunction with this, is to enjoy God; and we are here told that those
who order their conversation aright shall see his salvation. (1.) It is
not enough for us to offer praise, but we must withal order our
conversation aright. Thanksgiving is good, but thanks-living is better.
(2.) Those that would have their conversation right must take care and
pains to order it, to dispose it according to rule, to understand their
way and to direct it. (3.) Those that take care of their conversation
make sure their salvation; them God will make to see his salvation, for
it is a salvation ready to be revealed; he will make them to see it and
enjoy it, to see it, and to see themselves happy for ever in it. Note,
The right ordering of the conversation is the only way, and it is a sure
way, to obtain the great salvation.
