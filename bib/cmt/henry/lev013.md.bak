### [Leviticus Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 13:0</span></span>

The next ceremonial uncleanness is that of the leprosy, concerning which
the law was very large and particular; we have the discovery of it in
this chapter, and the cleansing of the leper in the next. Scarcely any
one thing in all the levitical law takes up so much room as this. I.
Rules are here given by which the priest must judge whether the man had
the leprosy or no, according as the symptom was that appeared. 1. If it
was a swelling, a scab, or a bright spot (v. 1-17). 2. If it was a bile
([Lev 13:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#018).md). 3. If it was in
inflammation ([Lev 13:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#024).md). 4. If it
was in the head or beard ([Lev
13:29-37](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#029).md). 5. If it was a bright spot
([Lev 13:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#038.md), [Lev
13:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#039).md). 6. If it was in a bald head
([Lev 13:40-44](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#040).md). II. Direction is
given how the leper must be disposed of ([Lev
13:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045.md), [Lev
13:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#046).md). III. Concerning the leprosy in
garments ([Lev 13:47](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#047), etc..md).

[Leviticus 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 13:1</span></span>

I. Concerning the plague of leprosy we may observe in general, 1. That
it was rather an uncleanness than a disease; or, at least, so the law
considered it, and therefore employed not the physicians but the priests
about it. Christ is said to cleanse lepers, not to cure them. We do not
read of any that died of the leprosy, but it rather buried them alive,
by rendering them unfit for conversation with any but such as were
infected like themselves. Yet there is a tradition that Pharaoh, who
sought to kill Moses, was the first that ever was struck with this
disease, and that he died of it. It is said to have begun first in
Egypt, whence it spread into Syria. It was very well known to Moses,
when he put his own hand into his bosom and took it out leprous. 2. That
it was a plague inflicted immediately by the hand of God, and came not
from natural causes, as other diseases; and therefore must be managed
according to a divine law. Miriam's leprosy, and Gehazi's, and king
Uzziah's, were all the punishments of particular sins: and, if generally
it was so, no marvel there was so much care taken to distinguish it from
a common distemper, that none might be looked upon as lying under this
extraordinary token of divine displeasure but those that really were so.
3. That it is a plague not now known in the world; what is commonly
called the leprosy is of a quite different nature. This seems to have
been reserved as a particular scourge for the sinners of those times and
places. The Jews retained the idolatrous customs they had learnt in
Egypt, and therefore God justly caused this with some others of the
diseases of Egypt to follow them. Yet we read of Naaman the Syrian, who
was a leper, [Kg2 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#001.md). 4. That there
were other breakings-out in the body which did very much resemble the
leprosy, but were not it, which might make a man sore and loathsome and
yet not ceremonially unclean. Justly are our bodies called vile bodies,
which have in them the seeds of so many diseases, by which the lives of
so many are made bitter to them. 5. That the judgment of it was referred
to the priests. Lepers were looked upon as stigmatized by the justice of
God, and therefore it was left to his servants the priests, who might be
presumed to know his mark best, to pronounce who were lepers and who
were not. All the Jews say, "Any priest, though disabled by a blemish to
attend the sanctuary, might be a judge of the leprosy, provided the
blemish were not in his eye. And he might" (they say) "take a common
person to assist him in the search, but the priest only must pronounce
the judgment." 6. That it was a figure of the moral pollution of men's
minds by sin, which is the leprosy of the soul, defiling to the
conscience, and from which Christ alone can cleanse us; for herein the
power of his grace infinitely transcends that of the legal priesthood,
that the priest could only convict the leper (for by the law is the
knowledge of sin), but Christ can cure the leper, he can take away sin.
Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean, which was more than the
priests could do, [Mat 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#002.md). Some think
that the leprosy signified, not so much sin in general as a state of
sin, by which men are separated from God (their spot not being the spot
of God's children), and scandalous sin, for which men are to be shut out
from the communion of the faithful. It is a work of great importance,
but of great difficulty, to judge of our spiritual state: we have all
cause to suspect ourselves, being conscious to ourselves of sores and
spots, but whether clean or unclean is the question. A man might have a
scab ([Lev 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#006).md) and yet be clean: the
best have their infirmities; but, as there were certain marks by which
to know that it was a leprosy, so there are characters of such as are in
the gall of bitterness, and the work of ministers is to declare the
judgment of leprosy and to assist those that suspect themselves in the
trial of their spiritual state, remitting or retaining sin. And hence
the keys of the kingdom of heaven are said to be given to them, because
they are to separate between the precious and the vile, and to judge who
are fit as clean to partake of the holy things and who as unclean must
be debarred from them.

II\. Several rules are here laid down by which the judgment of the
priest must be governed. 1. If the sore was but skin-deep, it was to be
hoped it was not the leprosy, [Lev
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#004.md). But, if it was deeper than the
skin, the man must be pronounced unclean, [Lev
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#003.md). The infirmities that consist
with grace do not sink deep into the soul, but the mind still serves the
law of God, and the inward man delights in it, [Rom
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#022.md), [Rom
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#025.md). But if the matter be really
worse than it shows, and the inwards be infected, the case is dangerous.
2. If the sore be at a stay, and do not spread, it is no leprosy, [Lev
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#004.md), [Lev
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#005.md). But if it spread much abroad,
and continue to do so after several inspections, the case is bad, [Lev
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#007.md), [Lev
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#008.md). If men do not grow worse, but a
stop be put to the course of their sins and their corruptions be
checked, it is to be hoped they will grow better; but if sin get ground,
and they become worse every day, they are going downhill. 3. If there
was proud raw flesh in the rising, the priest needed not to wait any
longer, it was certainly a leprosy, [Lev
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#010.md), [Lev
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#011.md). Nor is there any surer
indication of the badness of a man's spiritual state than the heart's
rising in self-conceit, confidence in the flesh, and resistance of the
reproofs of the word and strivings of the Spirit. 4. If the eruption,
whatever it was, covered all the skin from head to foot, it was no
leprosy ([Lev 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#012.md), [Lev
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#013).md); for it was an evidence that
the vitals were sound and strong, and nature hereby helped itself,
throwing out what was burdensome and pernicious. There is hope in the
small-pox when they come out well: so if men freely confess their sins,
and hide them not, there is no danger comparable to theirs that cover
their sins. Some gather this from it, that there is more hope of the
profane than of hypocrites. The publicans and harlots went into the
kingdom of heaven before scribes and Pharisees. In one respect, the
sudden breakings-out of passion, though bad enough, are not so dangerous
as malice concealed. Others gather this, that, if we judge ourselves, we
shall not be judged; if we see and own that there is no health in us, no
soundness in our flesh, by reason of sin, we shall find grace in the
eyes of the Lord. 5. The priest must take time in making his judgment,
and not give it rashly. If the matter looked suspicious, he must shut up
the patient seven days, and then seven days more, that his judgment
might be according to truth. This teaches all, both ministers and
people, not to be hasty in their censures, nor to judge any thing before
the time. If some men's sins go before unto judgment, the sins of others
follow after, and so men's good works; therefore let nothing be done
suddenly, [Ti1 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#022.md), [Ti1
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#024.md), [Ti1
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#025.md). 6. If the person suspected was
found to be clean, yet he must wash his clothes ([Lev
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#006).md), because he had been under the
suspicion, and there had been in him that which gave ground for the
suspicion. Even the prisoner that is acquitted must go down on his
knees. We have need to be washed in the blood of Christ from our spots,
though they be not leprosy-spots; for who can say, I am pure from sin?
though there are those who through grace are innocent from the great
transgression.

[Leviticus 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 13:18</span></span>

The priest is here instructed what judgment to make if there was any
appearance of a leprosy, either, 1. In an old ulcer, or bile, that has
been healed, [Lev 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#018.md), etc. When old
sores, that seemed to be cured, break out again, it is to be feared
there is a leprosy in them; such is the danger of those who, having
escaped the pollutions of the world, are again entangled therein and
overcome. Or, 2. In a burn by accident, for this seems to be meant, [Lev
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#024.md), etc. The burning of strife and
contention often proves the occasion of the rising up and breaking out
of that corruption which witnesses to men's faces that they are unclean.
3. In a scall-head. And in this commonly the judgment turned upon a very
small matter. If the hair in the scall was black, it was a sign of
soundness; if yellow, it was an indication of a leprosy, [Lev
13:30-37](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#030.md). The other rules in these
cases are the same with those mentioned before. In reading of these
several sorts of ailments, it will be good for us, 1. To lament the
calamitous state of human life, which lies exposed to so many
grievances. What troops of diseases are we beset with on every side! and
they all entered by sin. 2. To give thanks to God if he has never
afflicted us with any of these sores: if the constitution is healthful,
and the body lively and easy, we are bound to glorify God with our
bodies.

[Leviticus 13:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">lev 13:38</span></span>

We have here,

I. Provisos that neither a freckled skin nor a bald head should be
mistaken for a leprosy, [Lev 13:38-41](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#038.md).
Every deformity must not forthwith be made a ceremonial defilement.
Elisha was jeered for his bald head ([Kg2
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#023).md); but it was the children of
Bethel, that knew not the judgments of their God, who turned it to his
reproach.

II\. A particular brand set upon the leprosy if at any time it did
appear in a bald head: The plague is in his head, he is utterly unclean,
[Lev 13:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#044.md). If the leprosy of sin have
seized the head, if the judgment be corrupted, and wicked principles
which countenance and support wicked practices, be embraced, it is an
utter uncleanness, from which few are ever cleansed. Soundness in the
faith keeps the leprosy from the head, and saves conscience from being
shipwrecked.

III\. Directions what must be done with the convicted leper. When the
priest, upon mature deliberation, had solemnly pronounced him unclean,

1\. He must pronounce himself so, [Lev
13:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045.md). He must put himself into the
posture of a mourner and cry, Unclean, unclean. The leprosy was not
itself a sin, but it was a sad token of God's displeasure and a sore
affliction to him that was under it. It was a reproach to his name, put
a full stop to his business in the world, cut him off from conversation
with his friends and relations, condemned him to banishment till he was
cleansed, shut him out from the sanctuary, and was, in effect, the ruin
of all the comfort he could have in this world. Heman, it would seem,
either was a leper or alludes to the melancholy condition of a leper,
[Psa 88:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#008.md), etc. He must therefore,
(1.) Humble himself under the mighty hand of God, not insisting upon his
cleanness when the priest had pronounced him unclean, but justifying God
and accepting the punishment of his iniquity. He must signify this by
rending his clothes, uncovering his head, and covering his upper lip,
all tokens of shame and confusion of face, and very significant of that
self-loathing and self-abasement which should fill the hearts of
penitents, the language of which is self-judging. Thus must we take to
ourselves the shame that belongs to us, and with broken hearts call
ourselves by our own name, Unclean, unclean - heart unclean, life
unclean, unclean by original corruption, unclean by actual transgression
- unclean, and therefore worthy to be for ever excluded from communion
with God, and all hope of happiness in him. We are all as an unclean
thing ([Isa 64:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#006).md) - unclean, and
therefore undone, if infinite mercy do not interpose. (2.) He must give
warning to others to take heed of coming near him. Wherever he went, he
must cry to those he saw at a distance, "I am unclean, unclean, take
heed of touching me." Not that the leprosy was catching, but by the
touch of a leper ceremonial uncleanness was contracted. Every one
therefore was concerned to avoid it; and the leper himself must give
notice of the danger. And this was all that the law could do, in that it
was weak through the flesh; it taught the leper to cry, Unclean,
unclean, but the gospel has put another cry into the lepers' mouths,
[Luk 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#012.md), [Luk
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#013.md), where we find ten lepers crying
with a loud voice, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. The law only shows
us our disease; the gospel shows us our help in Christ.

2\. He must then be shut out of the camp, and afterwards, when they came
to Canaan, out of the city, town, or village, where he lived, and dwell
alone ([Lev 13:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#046).md), associating with
none but those that were lepers like himself. When king Uzziah became a
leper, he was banished from his palace, and dwelt in a separate house,
[Ch2 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#021.md). And see [Kg2
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#003.md). This typified the purity which
ought to be preserved in the gospel church, by the solemn and
authoritative exclusion of scandalous sinners, that hate to be reformed,
from the communion of the faithful. Put away from among yourselves that
wicked person, [Co1 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#013.md).

[Leviticus 13:47](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">lev 13:47</span></span>

This is the law concerning the plague of leprosy in a garment, whether
linen or woollen. A leprosy in a garment, with discernible indications
of it, the colour changed by it, the garment fretted, the nap worn off,
and this in some one particular part of the garment, and increasing when
it was shut up, and not to be got out by washing is a thing which to us
now is altogether unaccountable. The learned confess that it was a sign
and a miracle in Israel, an extraordinary punishment inflicted by the
divine power, as a token of great displeasure against a person or
family. 1. The process was much the same with that concerning a leprous
person. The garment suspected to be tainted was not to be burnt
immediately, though, it may be, there would have been no great loss of
it; for in no case must sentence be given merely upon a surmise, but it
must be shown to the priest. If, upon search, it was found that there
was a leprous spot (the Jews say no bigger than a bean), it must be
burnt, or at least that part of the garment in which the spot was, [Lev
13:52](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#052.md), [Lev
13:57](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#057.md). If the cause of the suspicion
was gone, it must be washed, and then might be used, [Lev
13:58](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#058.md). 2. The signification also was
much the same, to intimate the great malignity there is in sin: it not
only defiles the sinner's conscience, but it brings a stain upon all his
employments and enjoyments, all he has and all he does. To those that
are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure, [Tit
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015.md). And we are taught hereby to hate
even the garments spotted with the flesh, [Jde
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#023.md). Those that make their clothes
servants to their pride and lust may see them thereby tainted with a
leprosy, and doomed to the fire, [Isa
3:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#018.md). But the ornament of the
hidden man of the heart is incorruptible, [Pe1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#004.md). The robes of righteousness never
fret nor are moth-eaten.
