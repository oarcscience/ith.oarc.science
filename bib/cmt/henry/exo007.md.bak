### [Exodus Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 7:0</span></span>

In this chapter, I. The dispute between God and Moses finishes, and
Moses applies himself to the execution of his commission, in obedience
to God's command ([Exo 7:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#001).md). II. The
dispute between Moses and Pharaoh begins, and a famous trial of skill it
was. Moses, in God's name, demands Israel's release; Pharaoh denies it.
The contest is between the power of the great God and the power of a
proud prince; and it will be found, in the issue, that when God judgeth
he will overcome. 1. Moses confirms the demand he had made to Pharaoh,
by a miracle, turning his rod into a serpent; but Pharaoh hardens his
heart against this conviction ([Exo
7:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#008).md). 2. He chastises his
disobedience by a plague, the first of the ten, turning the waters into
blood; but Pharaoh hardens his heart against this correction, [Exo
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#014), etc..md).

[Exodus 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 7:1</span></span>

Here, I. God encourages Moses to go to Pharaoh, and at last silences all
his discouragements. 1. He clothes him with great power and authority
([Exo 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#001).md): I have made thee a god to
Pharaoh; that is, my representative in this affair, as magistrates are
called gods, because they are God's viceregents. He was authorized to
speak and act in God's name and stead, and, under the divine direction,
was endued with a divine power to do that which is above the ordinary
power of nature, and invested with a divine authority to demand
obedience from a sovereign prince and punish disobedience. Moses was a
god, but he was only a made god, not essentially one by nature; he was
no god but by commission. He was a god, but he was a god only to
Pharaoh; the living and true God is a God to all the world. It is an
instance of God's condescension, and an evidence that his thoughts
towards us are thoughts of peace, that when he treats with men he treats
by men, whose terror shall not make us afraid. 2. He again nominates him
an assistant, his brother Aaron, who was not a man of uncircumcised
lips, but a notable spokesman: "He shall be thy prophet," that is, "he
shall speak from thee to Pharaoh, as prophets do from God to the
children of men. Thou shalt, as a god, inflict and remove the plagues,
and Aaron, as a prophet, shall denounce them, and threaten Pharaoh with
them." 3. He tells him the worst of it, that Pharaoh would not hearken
to him, and yet the work should be done at last, Israel should be
delivered and God therein would be glorified, [Exo
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#004.md), [Exo
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#005.md). The Egyptians, who would not know
the Lord, should be made to know him. Note, It is, and ought to be,
satisfaction enough to God's messengers that, whatever contradiction and
opposition may be given them, thus far they shall gain their point, that
God will be glorified in the success of their embassy, and all his
chosen Israel will be saved, and then they have no reason to say that
they have laboured in vain. See here, (1.) How God glorifies himself; he
makes people know that he is Jehovah. Israel is made to know it by the
performance of his promises to them ([Exo
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003).md), and the Egyptians are made to
know it by the pouring out of his wrath upon them. Thus God's name is
exalted both in those that are saved and in those that perish. (2.) What
method he takes to do this: he humbles the proud, and exalts the poor,
[Luk 1:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#051.md), [Luk
1:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#052.md). If God stretch out his hand to
sinners in vain, he will at last stretch out his hand upon them; and who
can bear the weight of it?

II\. Moses and Aaron apply themselves to their work without further
objection: They did as the Lord commanded them, [Exo
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#006.md). Their obedience, all things
considered, was well worthy to be celebrated, as it is by the Psalmist
([Psa 105:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#028).md), They rebelled not
against his word, namely, Moses and Aaron, whom he mentions, v. 26. Thus
Jonah, though at first he was very averse, at length went to Nineveh.
Notice is taken of the age of Moses and Aaron when they undertook this
glorious service. Aaron the elder (and yet the inferior in office) was
eighty-three, Moses was eighty; both of them men of great gravity and
experience, whose age was venerable, and whose years might teach wisdom,
v. 7. Joseph, who was to be only a servant to Pharaoh, was preferred at
thirty years old; but Moses, who was to be a god to Pharaoh, was not so
dignified until he was eighty years old. It was fit that he should long
wait for such an honour, and be long in preparing for such a service.

[Exodus 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 7:8</span></span>

The first time that Moses made his application to Pharaoh, he produced
his instructions only; now he is directed to produce his credentials,
and does accordingly. 1. It is taken for granted that Pharaoh would
challenge these demandants to work a miracle, that, by a performance
evidently above the power of nature, they might prove their commission
from the God of nature. Pharaoh will say, Show a miracle; not with any
desire to be convinced, but with the hope that none will be wrought, and
then he would have some colour for his infidelity. 2. Orders are
therefore given to turn the rod into a serpent, according to the
instructions, [Exo 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#003.md). The same rod
that was to give the signal of the other miracles is now itself the
subject of a miracle, to put a reputation upon it. Aaron cast his rod to
the ground, and instantly it became a serpent, [Exo
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#010.md). This was proper, not only to
affect Pharaoh with wonder, but to strike a terror upon him. Serpents
are hurtful dreadful animals; the very sight of one, thus miraculously
produced, might have softened his heart into a fear of that God by whose
power it was produced. This first miracle, though it was not a plague,
yet amounted to the threatening of a plague. If it made not Pharaoh
feel, it made him fear; and this is God's method of dealing with sinners
- he comes upon them gradually. 3. This miracle, though too plain to be
denied, is enervated, and the conviction of it taken off, by the
magicians' imitation of it, [Exo 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#011.md),
[Exo 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#012.md). Moses had been originally
instructed in the learning of the Egyptians, and was suspected to have
improved himself in magical arts in his long retirement; the magicians
are therefore sent for, to vie with him. And some think those of that
profession had a particular spite against the Hebrews ever since Joseph
put them all to shame, by interpreting a dream which they could make
nothing of, in remembrance of which slur put on their predecessors these
magicians withstood Moses, as it is explained, [Ti2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008.md). Their rods became serpents, real
serpents; some think, by the power of God, beyond their intention or
expectation, for the hardening of Pharaoh's heart; others think, by the
power of evil angels, artfully substituting serpents in the room of the
rods, God permitting the delusion to be wrought for wise and holy ends,
that those might believe a lie who received not the truth: and herein
the Lord was righteous. Yet this might have helped to frighten Pharaoh
into a compliance with the demands of Moses, that he might be freed from
these dreadful unaccountable phenomena, with which he saw himself on all
sides surrounded. But to the seed of the serpent these serpents were no
amazement. Note, God suffers the lying spirit to do strange things, that
the faith of some may be tried and manifested ([Deu
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#003.md); [Co1
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#019).md), that the infidelity of others
may be confirmed, and that he who is filthy may be filthy still, [Co2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004.md). 4. Yet, in this contest, Moses
plainly gains the victory. The serpent which Aaron's rod was turned into
swallowed up the others, which was sufficient to have convinced Pharaoh
on which side the right lay. Note, Great is the truth, and will prevail.
The cause of God will undoubtedly triumph at last over all competition
and contradiction, and will reign alone, [Dan
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044.md). But Pharaoh was not wrought upon
by this. The magicians having produced serpents, he had this to say,
that the case between them and Moses was disputable; and the very
appearance of an opposition to truth, and the least head made against
it, serve those for a justification of their infidelity who are
prejudiced against the light and love of it.

[Exodus 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 7:14</span></span>

Here is the first of the ten plagues, the turning of the water into
blood, which was, 1. A dreadful plague, and very grievous. The very
sight of such vast rolling streams of blood, pure blood no doubt, florid
and high-colored, could not but strike a horror upon people: much more
afflictive were the consequences of it. Nothing more common than water:
so wisely has Providence ordered it, and so kindly, that that which is
so needful and serviceable to the comfort of human life should be cheap,
and almost every where to be had; but now the Egyptians must either
drink blood, or die for thirst. Fish was much of their food ([Num
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#005).md), but the changing of the waters
was the death of the fish; it was a pestilence in that element ([Exo
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#021).md): The fish died. In the general
deluge they escaped, because perhaps they had not then contributed so
much to the luxury of man as they have since; but in this particular
judgment they perished ([Psa 105:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#029).md):
He slew their fish; and when another destruction of Egypt, long
afterwards, is threatened, the disappointment of those that make sluices
and ponds for fish is particularly noticed, [Isa
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#010.md). Egypt was a pleasant land, but
the noisome stench of dead fish and blood, which by degrees would grow
putrid, now rendered it very unpleasant. 2. It was a righteous plague,
and justly inflicted upon the Egyptians. For, (1.) Nilus, the river of
Egypt, was their idol; they and their land derived so much benefit from
it that they served and worshipped it more than the Creator. The true
fountain of the Nile being unknown to them, they paid all their
devotions to its streams: here therefore God punished them, and turned
that into blood which they had turned into a god. Note, That creature
which we idolize God justly removes from us, or embitters to us. He
makes that a scourge to us which we make a competitor with him. (2.)
They had stained the river with the blood of the Hebrews' children, and
now God made that river all bloody. Thus he gave them blood to drink,
for they were worthy, [Rev 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#006.md). Note,
Never any thirsted after blood, but, sooner or later, they had enough of
it. 3. It was a significant plague. Egypt had a great dependence upon
their river ([Zac 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#018).md), so that in
smiting the river they were warned of the destruction of all the
productions of their country, till it came at last to their firstborn;
and this red river proved a direful omen of the ruin of Pharaoh and all
his forces in the Red Sea. This plague of Egypt is alluded to in the
prediction of the ruin of the enemies of the New Testament church, [Rev
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#003.md), [Rev
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#004.md). But there the sea, as well as
the rivers and fountains of water, is turned into blood; for spiritual
judgments reach further, and strike deeper, than temporal judgments do.
And, lastly, let me observe in general concerning this plague that one
of the first miracles Moses wrought was turning water into blood, but
one of the first miracles our Lord Jesus wrought was turning water into
wine; for the law was given by Moses, and it was a dispensation of death
and terror; but grace and truth, which, like wine, make glad the heart,
came by Jesus Christ. Observe,

I. Moses is directed to give Pharaoh warning of this plague. "Pharaoh's
heart is hardened ([Exo 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#014).md),
therefore go and try what this will do to soften it," [Exo
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#015.md). Moses perhaps may not be
admitted into Pharaoh's presence-chamber, or the room of state where he
used to give audience to ambassadors; and therefore he is directed to
meet him by the river's brink, whither God foresaw he would come in the
morning, either for the pleasure of a morning's walk or to pay his
morning devotions to the river: for thus all people will walk, every one
in the name of his god; they will not fail to worship their god every
morning. There Moses must be ready to give him a new summons to
surrender, and, in case of a refusal, to tell him of the judgment that
was coming upon that very river on the banks of which they were now
standing. Notice is thus given him of it beforehand, that they might
have no colour to say it was a chance, or to attribute it to any other
cause, but that it might appear to be done by the power of the God of
the Hebrews, and as a punishment upon him for his obstinacy. Moses is
expressly ordered to take the rod with him, that Pharaoh might be
alarmed at the sight of that rod which had so lately triumphed over the
rods of the magicians. Now learn hence, 1. That the judgments of God are
all known to himself beforehand. He knows what he will do in wrath as
well as in mercy. Every consumption is a consumption determined, [Isa
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#023.md). 2. That men cannot escape the
alarms of God's wrath, because they cannot go out of the hearing of
their own consciences: he that made their hearts can make his sword to
approach them. 3. That God warns before he wounds; for he is
long-suffering, not willing that any should perish, but that all should
come to repentance.

II\. Aaron (who carried the mace) is directed to summon the plague by
smiting the river with his rod, [Exo
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#019.md), [Exo
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#020.md). It was done in the sight of
Pharaoh and his attendants; for God's true miracles were not performed,
as Satan's lying wonders were, by those that peeped and muttered: truth
seeks no corners. An amazing change was immediately wrought; all the
waters, not only in the rivers but in all their ponds, were turned into
blood. 1. See here the almighty power of God. Every creature is that to
us which he makes it to be, water or blood. 2. See the mutability of all
things under the sun, and what changes we may meet with in them. That
which is water today may be blood tomorrow; what is always vain may soon
become vexatious. A river, at the best, is transient; but divine justice
can quickly make it malignant. 3. See what mischievous work sin makes.
if the things that have been our comforts prove our crosses, we must
thank ourselves: it is sin that turns our waters into blood.

III\. Pharaoh endeavours to confront the miracle, because he resolves
not to humble himself under the plague. He sends for the magicians, and,
by God's permission, they ape the miracle with their enchantments ([Exo
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#022).md), and this serves Pharaoh for an
excuse not to set his heart to this also ([Exo
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#023).md), and a pitiful excuse it was.
Could they have turned the river of blood into water again, this would
have been something to the purpose; then they would have proved their
power, and Pharaoh would have been obliged to them as his benefactors.
But for them, when there was such scarcity of water, to turn more of it
into blood, only to show their art, plainly intimates that the design of
the devil is only to delude his devotees and amuse them, not to do them
any real kindness, but to keep them from doing a real kindness to
themselves by repenting and returning to their God.

IV\. The Egyptians, in the mean time, are seeking for relief against the
plague, digging round about the river for water to drink, [Exo
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#024.md). Probably they found some, with
much ado, God remembering mercy in the midst of wrath; for he is full of
compassion, and would not let the subjects smart too much for the
obstinacy of their prince.

V. The plague continued seven days ([Exo
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#025).md), and, in all that time,
Pharaoh's proud heart would not let him so much as desire Moses to
intercede for the removal of it. Thus the hypocrites in heart heap up
wrath; they cry not when he binds them ([Job
36:13](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#013).md); and then no wonder that his
anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
