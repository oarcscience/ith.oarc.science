### [Ephesians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001.md)

[Ephesians](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eph 2:0</span></span>

This chapter contains an account, I. Of the miserable condition of these
Ephesians by nature ([Eph 2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001).md) and
again ([Eph 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011.md), [Eph
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012).md). II. Of the glorious change that
was wrought in them by converting grace ([Eph
2:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#004).md) and again ([Eph
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#013).md). III. Of the great and mighty
privileges that both converted Jews and Gentiles receive from Christ
([Eph 2:14-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014).md). The apostle endeavours
to affect them with a due sense of the wonderful change which divine
grace had wrought in them; and this is very applicable to that great
change which the same grace works in all those who are brought into a
state of grace. So that we have here a lively picture both of the misery
of unregenerate men and of the happy condition of converted souls,
enough to awaken and alarm those who are yet in their sins and to put
them upon hastening out of that state, and to comfort and delight those
whom God hath quickened, with a consideration of the mighty privileges
with which they are invested.

[Ephesians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eph 2:1</span></span>

The miserable condition of the Ephesians by nature is here in part
described. Observed, 1. Unregenerate souls are dead in trespasses and
sins. All those who are in their sins, are dead in sins; yea, in
trespasses and sins, which may signify all sorts of sins, habitual and
actual, sins of heart and of life. Sin is the death of the soul.
Wherever that prevails there is a privation of all spiritual life.
Sinners are dead in state, being destitute of the principles, and powers
of spiritual life; and cut off from God, the fountain of life: and they
are dead in law, as a condemned malefactor is said to be a dead man. 2.
A state of sin is a state of conformity to this world, [Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002.md). In the first verse he speaks of
their internal state, in this of their outward conversation: Wherein, in
which trespasses and sins, in time past you walked, you lived and
behaved yourselves in such a manner as the men of the world are used to
do. 3. We are by nature bond-slaves to sin and Satan. Those who walk in
trespasses and sins, and according to the course of this world, walk
according to the prince of the power of the air. The devil, or the
prince of devils, is thus described. See [Mat
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#024.md), [Mat
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#026.md). The legions of apostate angels
are as one power united under one chief; and therefore what is called
the powers of darkness elsewhere is here spoken of in the singular
number. The air is represented as the seat of his kingdom: and it was
the opinion of both Jews and heathens that the air is full of spirits,
and that there they exercise and exert themselves. The devil seems to
have some power (by God's permission) in the lower region of the air;
there he is at hand to tempt men, and to do as much mischief to the
world as he can: but it is the comfort and joy of God's people that he
who is head over all things to the church has conquered the devil and
has him in his chain. But wicked men are slaves to Satan, for they walk
according to him; they conform their lives and actions to the will and
pleasure of this great usurper. The course and tenour of their lives are
according to his suggestions, and in compliance with his temptations;
they are subject to him, and are led captive by him at his will,
whereupon he is called the god of this world, and the spirit that now
worketh in the children of disobedience. The children of disobedience
are such as choose to disobey God, and to serve the devil; in these he
works very powerfully and effectually. As the good Spirit works that
which is good in obedient souls, so this evil spirit works that which is
evil in wicked men; and he now works, not only heretofore, but even
since the world has been blessed with the light of the glorious gospel.
The apostle adds, Among whom also we all had our conversation in times
past, which words refer to the Jews, whom he signifies here to have been
in the like sad and miserable condition by nature, and to have been as
vile and wicked as the unregenerate Gentiles themselves, and whose
natural state he further describes in the next words. 4. We are by
nature drudges to the flesh, and to our corrupt affections, [Eph
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003.md). By fulfilling the desires of the
flesh and of the mind, men contract that filthiness of flesh and spirit
from which the apostle exhorts Christians to cleanse themselves, [Co2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001.md). The fulfilling of the desires of
the flesh and of the mind includes all the sin and wickedness that are
acted in and by both the inferior and the higher or nobler powers of the
soul. We lived in the actual commission of all those sins to which
corrupt nature inclined us. The carnal mind makes a man a perfect slave
to his vicious appetite. - The fulfilling of the wills of the flesh, so
the words may be rendered, denoting the efficacy of these lusts, and
what power they have over those who yield themselves up unto them. 5. We
are by nature the children of wrath, even as others. The Jews were so,
as well as the Gentiles; and one man is as much so as another by nature,
not only by custom and imitation, but from the time when we began to
exist, and by reason of our natural inclinations and appetites. All men,
being naturally children of disobedience, are also by nature children of
wrath: God is angry with the wicked every day. Our state and course are
such as deserve wrath, and would end in eternal wrath, if divine grace
did not interpose. What reason have sinners then to be looking out for
that grace that will make them, of children of wrath, children of God
and heirs of glory! Thus far the apostle has described the misery of a
natural state in these verses, which we shall find him pursuing again in
some following ones.

[Ephesians 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eph 2:4</span></span>

Here the apostle begins his account of the glorious change that was
wrought in them by converting grace, where observe,

I. By whom, and in what manner, it was brought about and effected. 1.
Negatively: Not of yourselves, [Eph
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008.md). Our faith, our conversion, and
our eternal salvation, are not the mere product of any natural
abilities, nor of any merit of our own: Not of works, lest any man
should boast, [Eph 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#009.md). These things
are not brought to pass by any thing done by us, and therefore all
boasting is excluded; he who glories must not glory in himself, but in
the Lord. There is no room for any man's boasting of his own abilities
and power; or as though he had done any thing that might deserve such
immense favours from God. 2. Positively: But God, who is rich in mercy,
etc., [Eph 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#004.md). God himself is the
author of this great and happy change, and his great love is the spring
and fontal cause of it; hence he resolved to show mercy. Love is his
inclination to do us good considered simply as creatures; mercy respects
us as apostate and as miserable creatures. Observe, God's eternal love
or good-will towards his creatures is the fountain whence all his
mercies vouch-safed to us proceed; and that love of God is great love,
and that mercy of his is rich mercy, inexpressibly great and
inexhaustibly rich. And then by grace you are saved ([Eph
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#005).md), and by grace are you saved
through faith - it is the gift of God, [Eph
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008.md). Note, Every converted sinner is a
saved sinner. Such are delivered from sin and wrath; they are brought
into a state of salvation, and have a right given them by grace to
eternal happiness. The grace that saves them is the free undeserved
goodness and favour of God; and he saves them, not by the works of the
law, but through faith in Christ Jesus, by means of which they come to
partake of the great blessings of the gospel; and both that faith and
that salvation on which it has so great an influence are the gift of
God. The great objects of faith are made known by divine revelation, and
made credible by the testimony and evidence which God hath given us; and
that we believe to salvation and obtain salvation through faith is
entirely owing to divine assistance and grace; God has ordered all so
that the whole shall appear to be of grace. Observe,

II\. Wherein this change consists, in several particulars, answering to
the misery of our natural state, some of which are enumerated in this
section, and others are mentioned below. 1. We who were dead are
quickened ([Eph 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#005).md), we are saved
from the death of sin and have a principle of spiritual life implanted
in us. Grace in the soul is a new life in the soul. As death locks up
the senses, seals up all the powers and faculties, so does a state of
sin, as to any thing that is good. Grace unlocks and opens all, and
enlarges the soul. Observe, A regenerate sinner becomes a living soul:
he lives a life of sanctification, being born of God; and he lives in
the sense of the law, being delivered from the guilt of sin by pardoning
and justifying grace. He hath quickened us together with Christ. Our
spiritual life results from our union with Christ; it is in him that we
live: Because I live, you shall live also. 2. We who were buried are
raised up, [Eph 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006.md). What remains yet
to be done is here spoken of as though it were already past, though
indeed we are raised up in virtue of our union with him whom God hath
raised from the dead. When he raised Christ from the dead, he did in
effect raise up all believers together with him, he being their common
head; and when he placed him at his right hand in heavenly places, he
advanced and glorified them in and with him, their raised and exalted
head and forerunner. - And made us sit together in heavenly places in
Christ Jesus. This may be understood in another sense. Sinners roll
themselves in the dust; sanctified souls sit in heavenly places, are
raised above the world; the world is as nothing to them, compared with
what it has been, and compared with what the other world is. Saints are
not only Christ's freemen, but they are assessors with him; by the
assistance of his grace they have ascended with him above this world to
converse with another, and they live in the constant expectation of it.
They are not only servants to the best of masters in the best work, but
they are exalted to reign with him; they sit upon the throne with
Christ, as he has sat down with his Father on his throne.

III\. Observe what is the great design and aim of God in producing and
effecting this change: And this, 1. With respect to others: That in the
ages to come he might show, etc. ([Eph
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#007).md), that he might give a specimen
and proof of his great goodness and mercy, for the encouragement of
sinners in future time. Observe, The goodness of God in converting and
saving sinners heretofore is a proper encouragement to others in
after-time to hope in his grace and mercy, and to apply themselves to
these. God having this in his design, poor sinners should take great
encouragement from it. And what may we not hope for from such grace and
kindness, from riches of grace, to which this change is owing? Through
Christ Jesus, by and through whom God conveys all his favour and
blessings to us. 2. With respect to the regenerated sinners themselves:
For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
etc., [Eph 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010.md). It appears that all
is of grace, because all our spiritual advantages are from God. We are
his workmanship; he means in respect of the new creation; not only as
men, but as saints. The new man is a new creature; and God is its
Creator. It is a new birth, and we are born or begotten of his will. In
Christ Jesus, that is, on the account of what he has done and suffered,
and by the influence and operation of his blessed Spirit. Unto good
works, etc. The apostle having before ascribed this change to divine
grace in exclusion of works, lest he should seem thereby to discourage
good works, he here observes that though the change is to be ascribed to
nothing of that nature (for we are the workmanship of God), yet God, in
his new creation, has designed and prepared us for good works: Created
unto good works, with a design that we should be fruitful in them.
Wherever God by his grace implants good principles, they are intended to
be for good works. Which God hath before ordained, that is, decreed and
appointed. Or, the words may be read, To which God hath before prepared
us, that is, by blessing us with the knowledge of his will, and with the
assistance of his Holy Spirit; and by producing such a change in us.
That we should walk in them, or glorify God by an exemplary conversation
and by our perseverance in holiness.

[Ephesians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eph 2:11</span></span>

In these verses the apostle proceeds in his account of the miserable
condition of these Ephesians by nature. Wherefore remember, etc., [Eph
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011.md). As if he had said, "You should
remember what you have been, and compare it with what you now are, in
order to humble yourselves and to excite your love and thankfulness to
God." Note, Converted sinners ought frequently to reflect upon the
sinfulness and misery of the state they were in by nature. Gentiles in
the flesh, that is, living in the corruption of their natures, and being
destitute of circumcision, the outward sign of an interest in the
covenant of grace. Who are called uncircumcision by that, etc., that is,
"You were reproached and upbraided for it by the formal Jews, who made
an external profession, and who looked no further than the outward
ordinance." Note, Hypocritical professors are wont to value themselves
chiefly on their external privileges, and to reproach and despise others
who are destitute of them. The apostle describes the misery of their
case in several particulars, [Eph
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012.md). "At that time, while you were
Gentiles, and in an unconverted state, you were," 1. "In a Christless
condition, without the knowledge of the Messiah, and without any saving
interest in him or relation to him." It is true of all unconverted
sinners, all those who are destitute of faith, that they have no saving
interest in Christ; and it must be a sad and deplorable thing for a soul
to be without a Christ. Being without Christ, they were, 2. Aliens from
the commonwealth of Israel; they did not belong to Christ's church, and
had no communion with it, that being confined to the Israelitish nation.
It is no small privilege to be placed in the church of Christ, and to
share with the members of it in the advantages peculiar to it. 3. They
are strangers from the covenants of promise. The covenant of grace has
ever been the same for substance, though, having undergone various
additions and improvements in the several ages of the church, it is
called covenants; and the covenants of promise, because it is made up of
promises, and particularly contains the great promise of the Messiah,
and of eternal life through him. Now the Ephesians, in their gentilism,
were strangers to this covenant, having never had any information nor
overture of it; and all unregenerate sinners are strangers to it, as
they have no interest in it. Those who are without Christ, and so have
no interest in the Mediator of the covenant, have none in the promises
of the covenant. 4. They had no hope, that is, beyond this life - no
well-grounded hope in God, no hope of spiritual and eternal blessings.
Those who are with out Christ, and strangers from the covenant, can have
no good hope; for Christ and the covenant are the ground and foundation
of all the Christian's hopes. They were in a state of distance and
estrangement from God: Without God in the world; not without some
general knowledge of a deity, for they worshipped idols, but living
without any due regard to him, any acknowledged dependence on him, and
any special interest in him. The words are, atheists in the world; for,
though they worshipped many gods, yet they were without the true God.

The apostle proceeds ([Eph 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#013).md)
further to illustrate the happy change that was made in their state: But
now, in Christ Jesus, you who sometimes were far off, etc. They were far
off from Christ, from his church, from the promises, from the Christian
hope, and from God himself; and therefore from all good, like the
prodigal son in the far country: this had been represented in the
preceding verses. Unconverted sinners remove themselves at a distance
from God, and God puts them at a distance: He beholds the proud afar
off. "But now in Christ Jesus, etc., upon your conversion, by virtue of
union with Christ, and interest in him by faith, you are made nigh."
They were brought home to God, received into the church, taken into the
covenant, and possessed of all other privileges consequent upon these.
Note, The saints are a people near to God. Salvation is far from the
wicked; but God is a help at hand to his people; and this is by the
blood of Christ, by the merit of his sufferings and death. Every
believing sinner owes his nearness to God, and his interest in his
favour, to the death and sacrifice of Christ.

[Ephesians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eph 2:14</span></span>

We have now come to the last part of the chapter, which contains an
account of the great and mighty privileges that converted Jews and
Gentiles both receive from Christ. The apostle here shows that those who
were in a state of enmity are reconciled. Between the Jews and the
Gentiles there had been a great enmity; so there is between God and
every unregenerate man. Now Jesus Christ is our peace, [Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014.md). He made peace by the sacrifice
of himself; and came to reconcile, 1. Jews and Gentiles to each other.
He made both one, by reconciling these two divisions of men, who were
wont to malign, to hate, and to reproach each other before. He broke
down the middle wall of partition, the ceremonial law, that made the
great feud, and was the badge of the Jews' peculiarity, called the
partition-wall by way of allusion to the partition in the temple, which
separated the court of the Gentiles from that into which the Jews only
had liberty to enter. Thus he abolished in his flesh the enmity, [Eph
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015.md). By his sufferings in the flesh,
to took away the binding power of the ceremonial law (so removing that
cause of enmity and distance between them), which is here called the law
of commandments contained in ordinances, because it enjoined a multitude
of external rites and ceremonies, and consisted of many institutions and
appointments about the outward parts of divine worship. The legal
ceremonies were abrogated by Christ, having their accomplishment in him.
By taking these out of the way, he formed one church of believers,
whether they had been Jews or Gentiles. Thus he made in himself of twain
one new man. He framed both these parties into one new society, or body
of God's people, uniting them to himself as their common head, they
being renewed by the Holy Ghost, and now concurring in a new way of
gospel worship, so making peace between these two parties, who were so
much at variance before. 2. There is an enmity between God and sinners,
whether Jews and Gentiles; and Christ came to slay that enmity, and to
reconcile them both to God, [Eph 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#016.md).
Sin breeds a quarrel between God and men. Christ came to take up the
quarrel, and to bring it to an end, by reconciling both Jew and Gentile,
now collected and gathered into one body, to a provoked and an offended
God: and this by the cross, or by the sacrifice of himself upon the
cross, having slain the enmity thereby. He, being slain or sacrificed,
slew the enmity that there was between God and poor sinners. The apostle
proceeds to illustrate the great advantages which both parties gain by
the mediation of our Lord Jesus Christ, [Eph
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017.md). Christ, who purchased peace on
the cross, came, partly in his own person, as to the Jews, who are here
said to have been nigh, and partly in his apostles, whom he commissioned
to preach the gospel to the Gentiles, who are said to have been afar
off, in the sense that has been given before. And preached peace, or
published the terms of reconciliation with God and of eternal life. Note
here, When the messengers of Christ deliver his truths, it is in effect
the same as if he did it immediately himself. He is said to preach by
them, insomuch that he who receiveth them receiveth him, and he who
despiseth them (acting by virtue of his commission, and delivering his
message) despiseth and rejecteth Christ himself. Now the effect of this
peace is the free access which both Jews and Gentiles have unto God
([Eph 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#018).md): For through him, in his
name and by virtue of his mediation, we both have access or admission
into the presence of God, who has become the common reconciled Father of
both: the throne of grace is erected for us to come to, and liberty of
approach to that throne is allowed us. Our access is by the Holy Spirit.
Christ purchased for us leave to come to God, and the Spirit gives us a
heart to come and strength to come, even grace to serve God acceptably.
Observe, We draw nigh to God, through Jesus Christ, by the help of the
Spirit. The Ephesians, upon their conversion, having such an access to
God, as well as the Jews, and by the same Spirit, the apostle tells
them, Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners, [Eph
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#019.md). This he mentions by way of
opposition to what he had observed of them in their heathenism: they
were now no longer aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and no longer
what the Jews were wont to account all the nations of the earth besides
themselves (namely, strangers to God), but fellow-citizens with the
saints, and of the household of God, that is, members of the church of
Christ, and having a right to all the privileges of it. Observe here,
The church is compared to a city, and every converted sinner is free of
it. It is also compared to a house, and every converted sinner is one of
the domestics, one of the family, a servant and a child in God's house.
In [Eph 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020.md) the church is compared to
a building. The apostles and prophets are the foundation of that
building. They may be so called in a secondary sense, Christ himself
being the primary foundation; but we are rather to understand it of the
doctrine delivered by the prophets of the Old Testament and the apostles
of the New. It follows, Jesus Christ himself being the chief
corner-stone. In him both Jews and Gentiles meet, and constitute one
church; and Christ supports the building by his strength: In whom all
the building, fitly framed together, etc., [Eph
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#021.md). All believers, of whom it
consists, being united to Christ by faith, and among themselves by
Christian charity, grow unto a holy temple, become a sacred society, in
which there is much communion between God and his people, as in the
temple, they worshipping and serving him, he manifesting himself unto
them, they offering up spiritual sacrifices to God and he dispensing his
blessings and favours to them. Thus the building, for the nature of it,
is a temple, a holy temple; for the church is the place which God hath
chosen to put his name there, and it becomes such a temple by grace and
strength derived from himself - in the Lord. The universal church being
built upon Christ as the foundation-stone, and united in Christ as the
corner-stone, comes at length to be glorified in him as the top-stone:
In whom you also are built together, etc., [Eph
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#022.md). Observe, Not only the universal
church is called the temple of God, but particular churches; and even
every true believer is a living temple, is a habitation of God through
the Spirit. God dwells in all believers now, they having become the
temple of God through the operations of the blessed Spirit, and his
dwelling with them now is an earnest of their dwelling together with him
to eternity.
