### [Micah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001.md)

In this chapter we have, I. The title of the book ([Mic
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001).md) and a preface demanding attention
([Mic 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#002).md). II. Warning given of
desolating judgments hastening upon the kingdoms of Israel and Judah
([Mic 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#003.md), [Mic
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#004).md), and all for sin ([Mic
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#005).md). III. The particulars of the
destruction specified ([Mic 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#006.md), [Mic
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#007).md). IV. The greatness of the
destruction illustrated, 1. By the prophet's sorrow for it ([Mic
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008.md), [Mic
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#009).md). 2. By the general sorrow that
should be for it, in the several places that must expect to share in it
([Mic 1:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#010).md). These prophecies of
Micah might well be called his lamentations.

[Micah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 1:1</span></span>

Here is, I. A general account of this prophet and his prophecy, [Mic
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001.md). This is prefixed for the
satisfaction of all that read and hear the prophecy of this book, who
will give the more credit to it when they know the author and his
authority. 1. The prophecy is the word of the Lord; it is a divine
revelation. Note, What is written in the Bible, and what is preached by
the ministers of Christ according to what is written there, must be
heard and received, not as the word of dying men, which we may be judges
of, but as the word of the living God, which we must be judged by, for
so it is. This word of the Lord came to the prophet, came plainly, came
powerfully, came in a preventing way, and he saw it, saw the vision in
which it was conveyed to him, saw the things themselves which he
foretold, with as much clearness and certainty as if they had been
already accomplished. 2. The prophet is Micah the Morasthite; his name
Micah is a contraction of Micaiah, the name of a prophet some ages
before (in Ahab's time, [Kg1 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#008).md);
his surname, the Morasthite, signifies that he was born, or lived, at
Moresheth, which is mentioned here ([Mic
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#014).md), or Mareshah, which is mentioned
[Mic 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#015.md), and [Jos
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#044.md). The place of his abode is
mentioned, that any one might enquire in that place, at that time, and
might find there was, or had been, such a one there, who was generally
reputed to be a prophet. 3. The date of his prophecy is in the reigns of
three kings of Judah - Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. Ahaz was one of the
worst of Judah's kings, and Hezekiah one of the best; such variety of
times pass over God's ministers, times that frown and times that smile,
to each of which they must study to accommodate themselves, and to arm
themselves against the temptations of both. The promises and
threatenings of this book are interwoven, by which it appears that even
in the wicked reign he preached comfort, and said to the righteous then
that it should be well with them; and that in the pious reign he
preached conviction, and said to the wicked then that it should be ill
with them; for, however the times change, the word of the Lord is still
the same. 4. The parties concerned in this prophecy; it is concerning
Samaria and Jerusalem, the head cities of the two kingdoms of Israel and
Judah, under the influence of which the kingdoms themselves were. Though
the ten tribes have deserted the houses both of David and Aaron, yet God
is pleased to send prophets to them.

II\. A very solemn introduction to the following prophecy ([Mic
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#002).md), in which, 1. The people are
summoned to draw near and give their attendance, as upon a court of
judicature: Hear, all you people, Note, Where God has a mouth to speak
we must have an ear to hear; we all must, for we are all concerned in
what is delivered. "Hear, you people" (all of them, so the margin reads
it), "all you that are now within hearing, and all others that hear it
at second hand." It is an unusual construction; but those words with
which Micah begins his prophecy are the very same in the original with
those wherewith Micaiah ended his, [Kg1
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#028.md). 2. The earth is called upon,
with all that therein is, to hear what the prophet has to say: Hearken,
O earth! The earth shall be made to shake under the stroke and weight of
the judgments coming; sooner will the earth hear than this stupid
senseless people; but God will be heard when he pleads. If the church,
and those in it, will not hear, the earth, and those in it, shall, and
shame them. 3. God himself is appealed to, and his omniscience, power,
and justice, are vouched in testimony against this people: "Let the Lord
God be witness against you, a witness that you had fair warning given
you, that your prophets did their duty faithfully as watchmen, but you
would not take the warning; let the accomplishment of the prophecy be a
witness against your contempt and disbelief of it, and prove, to your
conviction and confusion, that it was the word of God, and no word of
his shall fall to the ground." Note, God himself will be a witness, by
the judgments of his hand, against those that would not receive his
testimony in the judgments of his mouth. He will be a witness from his
holy temple in heaven, when he comes down to execute judgment ([Mic
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#003).md) against those that turned a deaf
ear to his oracles, wherein he witnessed to them, out of his holy temple
at Jerusalem.

III\. A terrible prediction of destroying judgments which should come
upon Judah and Israel, which had its accomplishment soon after in
Israel, and at length in Judah; for it is foretold, 1. That God himself
will appear against them, [Mic 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#003.md).
They boasted of themselves and their relation to God, as if that would
secure them; but, though God never deceives the faith of the upright, he
will disappoint the presumption of the hypocrites, for, behold, the Lord
comes forth out of his place, quits his mercy-seat, where they thought
they had him fast, and prepares his throne for judgment; his glory
departs, for they drive it from them. God's way towards this people had
long been a way of mercy, but now he changes his way, he comes out of
his place, and will come down. He had seemed to retire, as one
regardless of what was done, but now he will show himself, he will rend
the heavens, and will come down, not as sometimes, in surprising
mercies, but in surprising judgments, to do things not for them, but
against them, which they looked not for, [Isa
64:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md); [Isa
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#021.md). 2. That when the Creator
appears against them it shall be in vain for any creature to appear for
them. He will tread with contempt and disdain upon the high places of
the earth, upon all the powers that are advanced in competition with him
or in opposition to him; and he will so tread upon them as to tread them
down and level them. High places, set up for the worship of idols or for
military fortifications, shall all be trodden down and trampled into the
dust. Do men trust to the height and strength of the mountains and
rocks, as if they were sufficient to bear up their hopes and bear off
their fears? They shall be molten under him, melted down as wax before
the fire, [Psa 68:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#002.md). Do they trust to
the fruitfulness of the valleys, and their products? They shall be
cleft, or rent, with those fiery streams that shall come pouring down
from the mountains when they are melted. They shall be ploughed and
washed away as the ground is by the waters that are poured down a steep
place. God is said to cleave the earth with rivers, [Hab
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#009.md). Neither men of high degree, as
the mountains, nor men of low degree, as the valleys, shall be able to
secure either themselves or the land from judgments of God, when they
are sent with commission to lay all waste, and, like a sweeping rain, to
leave no food, [Pro 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#003.md). This is
applied particularly to the head city of Israel, which they hoped would
be a protection to the kingdom ([Mic
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#006)..md) I will make Samaria, that is now
a rich and populous city, as a heap of the field, as a heap of dung laid
there to be spread, or as a heap of stones gathered together to be
carried away, and as plantings of a vineyard, as hillocks of earth
raised to plant vines in. God will make of that city a heap, of that
defenced city a ruin, [Isa 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#002.md). Their
altars had been as heaps in the furrows of the fields ([Hos
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011).md) and now their houses shall be
so, as ruinous heaps. The stones of the city are poured down into the
valley by the fury of the conqueror, who will thus be revenged on those
walls that so long held out against him. They shall be quite pulled
down, so that the very foundations shall be discovered, that had been
covered by the superstructure; and not one stone shall be left upon
another.

IV\. A charge of sin upon them, as the procuring cause of these
desolating judgments ([Mic 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#005).md): For
the transgression of Jacob is all this. If it be asked, "Why is God so
angry, and why are Jacob and Israel thus brought to ruin by his anger?"
the answer is ready: Sin has done all the mischief; sin has laid all
waste; all the calamities of Jacob and Israel are owing to their
transgressions; if they had not gone away from God, he would never have
appeared thus against them. Note, External privileges and professions
will not secure a sinful people from the judgments of God. If sin be
found in the house of Israel, if Jacob be guilty of transgression and
rebellion, God will not spare them; no, he will punish them first, for
their sins are of all others most provoking to him, for they are most
reproaching. But it is asked, What is the transgression of Jacob? Note,
When we feel the smart of sin it concerns us to enquire what the sin is
which we smart for, that we may particularly war against that which wars
against us. And what is it? 1. It is idolatry; it is the high places;
that is the transgression, the great transgression which reigns in
Israel; that is spiritual whoredom, the violation of the
marriage-covenant, which merits a divorce. Even the high places of
Judah, though not so bad as the transgression of Jacob, were yet
offensive enough to God, and a remaining blemish upon some of the good
reigns. Howbeit the high places were not taken away. 2. It is the
idolatry of Samaria and Jerusalem, the royal cities of those two
kingdoms. These were the most populous places, and where there were most
people there was most wickedness, and they made one another worse. These
were the most pompous places; there men lived most in wealth and
pleasure, and they forgot God. These were the places that had the
greatest influence upon the country, by authority and example; so that
from them idolatry and profaneness went forth throughout all the land,
[Jer 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#015.md). Note, Spiritual distempers
are most contagious in persons and places that are most conspicuous. If
the head city of a kingdom, or the chief family in a parish, be vicious
and profane, many will follow their pernicious ways, and write after a
bad copy when great ones set it for them. The vices of leaders and
rulers are leading ruling vices, and therefore shall be surely and
sorely punished. Those have a great deal to answer for indeed that not
only sin, but make Israel to sin. Those must expect to be made examples
that have been examples of wickedness. If the transgression of Jacob is
Samaria, therefore shall Samaria become a heap. Let the ringleaders in
sin hear this and fear.

V. The punishment made to answer the sin, in the particular destruction
of the idols, [Mic 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#007.md). 1. The gods
they worshipped shall be destroyed: The graven images shall be beaten to
pieces by the army of the Assyrians, and all the idols shall be laid
desolate. Samaria and her idols were ruined together by Sennacherib
([Isa 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#011).md), and their gods cast into
the fire, for they were no gods ([Isa
37:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#019).md); and this was the Lord's doing:
I will lay the idols desolate. Note, If the law of God prevail not to
make men in authority destroy idols, God will take the work into his own
hands, and will do it himself. 2. The gifts that passed between them and
their gods shall be destroyed; for all the hires thereof shall be burnt
with fire, which may be meant either of the presents they made to their
idols for the replenishing of their altars, and the adorning of their
statues and temples (these shall become a prey to the victorious army,
which shall rifle not only private houses, but the houses of their
gods), or of the corn, and wine, and oil, which they called the rewards,
or hires, which their idols, their lovers, gave them ([Hos
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#012).md); these shall be taken from them
by him whom (by ascribing them to their dear idols) they had defrauded
of the honour due to him. Note, That cannot prosper by which men either
are hired to sin or hire others to sin; for the wages of sin will be
death. She gathered it of the hire of the harlot, and it shall return to
the hire of a harlot. They enriched themselves by their leagues with the
idolatrous nations, who gave them advantages, to court them into the
service of their idols, and their idols' temples were enriched with
gifts by those who went a whoring after them. And all this wealth shall
become a prey to the idolatrous nations, and so be the hire of a harlot
again, wages to an army of idolaters, who shall take it as a reward
given them by their gods. It shall be a present to king Jareb, [Hos
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#006.md). What they gave to their idols,
and what they thought they got by them, shall be as the hire of a
harlot; the curse of God shall be upon it, and it shall never prosper,
nor do them any good. It is common that what is squeezed out by one lust
is squandered away upon another.

[Micah 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 1:8</span></span>

We have here a long train of mourners attending the funeral of a ruined
kingdom.

I. The prophet is himself chief mourner ([Mic
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008.md), [Mic
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#009).md): I will wail and howl; I will go
stripped and naked, as a man distracted with grief. The prophets usually
expressed their own grief for the public grievances, partly to mollify
the predictions of them, and to make it appear that is was not out of
ill-will that they denounced the judgments of God (so far were they from
desiring the woeful day that they dreaded it more than any thing),
partly to show how very dreadful and mournful the calamities would be,
and to stir up in the people a holy fear of them, that by repentance
they might turn away the wrath of God. Note, We ought to lament the
punishments of sinners as well as the sufferings of saints in this
world; the weeping prophet did so ([Jer
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001).md); so did this prophet. He makes a
wailing like the dragons, or rather the jackals, ravenous beasts that in
those countries used to meet in the night, and howl, and make hideous
noises; he mourns as the owls, the screech-owls, or ostriches, as some
read it. Two things the prophet here thus dolefully laments: - 1. That
Israel's case is desperate: Her wound is incurable; it is ruin without
remedy; man cannot help her; God will not, because she will not by
repentance and reformation help herself. There is indeed balm in Gilead
and a physician there; but they will not apply to the physician, nor
apply the balm to themselves, and therefore the wound is incurable. 2.
That Judah likewise is in danger. The cup is going round, and is now put
into Judah's hand: The enemy has come to the gate of Jerusalem. Soon
after the destruction of Samaria and the ten tribes, the Assyrian army,
under Sennacherib, laid siege to Jerusalem, came to the gate, but could
not force their way any further; however, it was with great concern and
trouble that the prophet foresaw the fright, so dearly did he love the
peace of Jerusalem.

II\. Several places are here brought in mourning, and are called upon to
mourn; but with this proviso, that they should not let the Philistines
hear them ([Mic 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#010).md): Declare it not
in Gath; this is borrowed from David's lamentation for Saul and Jonathan
([Sa2 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#020).md), Tell it not in Gath, for
the uncircumcised will triumph in Israel's tears. Note, One would not,
if it could be helped, gratify those that make themselves and their
companions merry with the sins or with the sorrows of God's Israel.
David was silent, and stifled his griefs, when the wicked were before
him, [Psa 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001.md). But, though it may be
prudent not to give way to a noisy sorrow, yet it is duty to admit a
silent one when the church of God is in distress. "Roll thyself in the
dust" (as great mourners used to do) "and so let the house of Judah and
every house in Jerusalem become a house of Aphrah, a house of dust,
covered with dust, crumbled into dust." When God makes the house dust it
becomes us to humble ourselves under his mighty hand, and to put our
mouths in the dust, thus accommodating ourselves to the providences that
concern us. Dust we are; God brings us to the dust, that we may know it,
and own it. Divers other places are here named that should be sharers in
this universal mourning, the names of some of which we do not find
elsewhere, whence it is conjectured that they are names put upon them by
the prophet, the signification of which might either indicate or
aggravate the miseries coming upon them, thereby to awaken this secure
and stupid people to a holy fear of divine wrath. We find Sennacherib's
invasion thus described, in the prediction of it, by the impressions of
terror it should make upon the several cities that fell in his way, [Isa
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#028.md), [Isa
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#029.md), etc. Let us observe the
particulars here, 1. The inhabitants of Saphir, which signifies neat and
beautiful (thou that dwellest fairly, so the margin reads it), shall
pass away into captivity, or be forced to flee, stripped of all their
ornaments and having their shame naked. Note, Those who appear ever so
fine and delicate know not what contempt they may be exposed to; and the
more grievous will the shame be to those who have been inhabitants of
Saphir. 2. The inhabitants of Zaanan, which signifies the country of
flocks, a populous country, where the people are as numerous and thick
as flocks of sheep, shall yet be so taken up with their own calamities,
felt or feared, that they shall not come forth in the mourning of
Bethezel, which signifies a place near, shall not condole with, nor
bring any succour to, their next neighbours in distress; for he shall
receive of you his standing; the enemy shall encamp among you, O
inhabitants of Zaanan! shall take up a station there, shall find footing
among you. Those may well think themselves excused from helping their
neighbours who find they have enough to do to help themselves and to
hold their own. 3. As for the inhabitants of Maroth (which, some think,
is put for Ramoth, others that it signifies the rough places), they
waited carefully for good, and were grieved for the want of it, but were
disappointed; for evil came from the Lord unto the gate of Jerusalem,
when the Assyrian army besieged it, [Mic
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#012.md). The inhabitants of Maroth might
well overlook their own particular grievances when they saw the holy
city itself in danger, and might well overlook the Assyrian, that was
the instrument, when they saw the evil coming from the Lord. 4. Lachish
was a city of Judah, which Sennacherib laid siege to, [Isa
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#001.md), [Isa
36:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#002.md). The inhabitants of that city are
called to bind the chariot to the swift beast, to prepare for a speedy
flight, as having no other way left to secure themselves and their
families; or it is spoken ironically: "You have had your chariots and
your swift beasts, but where are they now?" God's quarrel with Lachish
is that she is the beginning of sin, probably the sin of idolatry, to
the daughter of Zion ([Mic 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#013).md); they
had learned it from the ten tribes, their near neighbours, and so
infected the two tribes with it. Note, Those that help to bring sin into
a country do but thereby prepare for the throwing of themselves out of
it. Those must expect to be first in the punishment who have been
ringleaders in sin. The transgressions of Israel were found in thee;
when they came to be traced up to their original they were found to take
rise very much from that city. God knows at whose door to lay the blame
of the transgressions of Israel, and whom to find guilty. Lachish,
having been so much accessory to the sin of Israel, shall certainly be
reckoned with: Thou shalt give presents to Moresheth-gath, a city of the
Philistines, which perhaps had a dependence upon Gath, that famous
Philistine city; thou shalt send to court those of that city to assist
thee, but it shall be in vain, for ([Mic
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#014).md) the houses of Achzib (a city
which joined to Mareshah, or Moresheth, and is mentioned with it, [Jos
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#044).md) shall be a lie to the kings of
Israel; though they depend upon their strength, yet they shall fail
them. Here there is an allusion to the name. Achzib signifies a lie, and
so it shall prove to those that trust in it. 5. Mareshah, that could
not, or would not, help Israel, shall herself be made a prey ([Mic
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#015).md): "I will bring a heir (that is,
an enemy) that shall take possession of thy lands, with as much
assurance as if he were heir at law to them, and he shall come to
Adullam, and to the glory of Israel, that is, to Jerusalem the head
city;" or "The glory of Israel shall come to be as Adullam, a poor
despicable place;" or, "The king of Assyria, whom Israel had gloried in,
shall come to Adullam, in laying the country waste." 6. The whole land
of Judah seems to be spoken to ([Mic
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#016).md) and called to weeping and
mourning: "Make thee bald, by tearing thy hair and shaving thy head;
poll thee for thy delicate children, that had been tenderly and nicely
brought up; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle when she casts her
feathers and is all over bald; for they have gone into captivity from
thee, and are not likely to return; and their captivity will be the more
grievous to them because they have been brought up delicately and have
not been inured to hardship." Or this is directed particularly to the
inhabitants of Mareshah, as [Mic 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#015.md).
That was the prophet's own city, and yet he denounces the judgments of
God against it; for it shall be an aggravation of its sin that it had
such a prophet, and knew not the day of its visitation. Its being thus
privileged, since it improved not the privilege, shall not procure
favour for it either with God or with his prophet.
