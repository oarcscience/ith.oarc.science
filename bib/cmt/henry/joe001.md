### [Joel Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001.md)

This chapter is the description of a lamentable devastation made of the
country of Judah by locusts and caterpillars. Some think that the
prophet speaks of it as a thing to come and gives warning of it
beforehand, as usually the prophets did of judgments coming. Others
think that it was now present, and that his business was to affect the
people with it and awaken them by it to repentance. I. It is spoken of
as a judgment which there was no precedent of in former ages ([Joe
1:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001).md). II. All sorts of people
sharing in the calamity are called upon to lament it ([Joe
1:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#008).md). III. They are directed to
look up to God in their lamentations, and to humble themselves before
him ([Joe 1:14-20](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#014).md).

[Joel 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joe 1:1</span></span>

It is a foolish fancy which some of the Jews have, that this Joel the
prophet was the same with that Joel who was the son of Samuel ([Sa1
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#002).md); yet one of their rabbin very
gravely undertakes to show why Samuel is here called Pethuel. This Joel
was long after that. He here speaks of a sad and sore judgment which was
now brought, or to be brought, upon Judah, for their sins. Observe,

I. The greatness of the judgment, expressed here in two things: - 1. It
was such as could not be paralleled in the ages that were past, in
history, or in the memory of any living, [Joe
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#002.md). The old men are appealed to, who
could remember what had happened long ago; nay, and all the inhabitants
of the land are called on to testify, if they could any of them remember
the like. Let them go further than any man's memory, and prepare
themselves for the search of their fathers ([Job
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#008).md), and they would not find an
account of the like in any record. Note, Those that outdo their
predecessors in sin may justly expect to fall under greater and sorer
judgments than any of their predecessors knew. 2. It was such as would
not be forgotten in the ages to come ([Joe
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#003).md): "Tell you your children of it;
let them know what dismal tokens of the wrath of God you have been
under, that they make take warning, and may learn obedience by the
things which you have suffered, for it is designed for warning to them
also. Yea, let your children tell their children, and their children
another generation; let them tell it not only as a strange thing, which
may serve for matter of talk" (as such uncommon accidents are records in
our almanacs - It is so long since the plague, and fire - so long since
the great frost, and the great wind), "but let them tell it to teach
their children to stand in awe of God and of his judgments, and to
tremble before him." Note, We ought to transmit to posterity the
memorial of God's judgments as well as of his mercies.

II\. The judgment itself; it is an invasion of the country of Judea by a
great army. Many interpreters both ancient and modern understand it of
armies of men, the forces of the Assyrians, which, under Sennacherib,
took all the defenced cities of Judah, and then, no doubt, made havoc of
the country and destroyed the products of it: nay, some make the four
sorts of animals here names ([Joe 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#004).md)
to signify the four monarchies which, in their turns, were oppressive to
the people of the Jews, one destroying what had escaped the fury of the
other. Many of the Jewish expositors think it is a parabolic expression
of the coming of enemies, and their multitude, to lay all waste. So the
Chaldee paraphrast mentions these animals ([Joe
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#004).md); but afterwards ([Joe
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#025).md) puts instead of them, Nations,
peoples, tongues, languages, potentates, and revenging kingdoms. But it
seems much rather to be understood literally of armies of insects coming
upon the land and eating up the fruits of it. Locusts were one of the
plagues of Egypt. Of them it is said, There never were any like them,
nor should be ([Exo 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#014).md), none such
as those in Egypt, none such as these in Judah - none like those locusts
for bigness, none like these for multitude and the mischief they did.
The plague of locusts in Egypt lasted but for a few days; this seems to
have continued for four years successively (as some think), because here
are four sorts of insects mentioned ([Joe
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#004).md), one destroying what the other
left; but others think they came all in one year. We are not told, in
the history of the Old Testament, when this happened, but we are sure
that no word of God fell to the ground; and, though a devastation by
these insects is primarily intended here, yet it is expressed in such a
language as is very applicable to the destruction of the country by a
foreign enemy invading it, because, if the people were not humbled and
reformed by that less judgment which devoured the land, God would send
this greater upon them, which would devour the inhabitants; and by the
description of that they are bidden to take it for a warning. If this
nation of worms do not subdue them, another nation shall come to ruin
them. Observe, 1. What these animals are that are sent against them -
locusts and caterpillars, palmer-worms and canker-worms, [Joe
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#004.md). We cannot now describe how these
differed one from another; they were all little insects, any one of them
despicable, and which a man might easily crush with his foot or with his
finger; but when they came in vast swarms, or shoals, they were very
formidable and ate up all before them. Note, God is Lord of hosts, has
all creatures at his command, and, when he pleases, can humble and
mortify a proud and rebellious people by the weakest and most
contemptible creatures. Man is said to be a worm; and by this it appears
that he is less than a worm, for, when God pleases, worms are too hard
for him, plunder his country, eat up that for which he laboured, destroy
the forage, and cut off the subsistence of a potent nation. The weaker
the instrument is that God employs the more is his power magnified. 2.
What fury and force they came with. They are here called a nation ([Joe
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#006).md), because they are embodied, and
act by consent, and as it were with a common design; for, though the
locusts have no king, yet they go forth all of them by bands ([Pro
30:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#027).md), and it is there mentioned as
an instance of their wisdom. It is prudence for those that are weak
severally to unite and act jointly. They are strong, for they are
without number. The small dust of the balance is light, and easily blown
away, but a heap of dust is weighty; so a worm can do little (yet one
worm served to destroy Jonah's gourd), but numbers of them can do
wonders. They are said to have teeth of a lion, of a great lion, because
of the great and terrible execution they do. Note, Locusts become as
lions when they come armed with a divine commission. We read of the
locusts out of the bottomless pit, that their teeth were as the teeth of
lions, [Rev 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#008.md). 3. What mischief they
do. They eat up all before them ([Joe
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#004).md); what one leaves the other
devours; they destroy not only the grass and corn, but the trees ([Joe
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#007).md): The vine is laid waste. There
vermin eat the leaves which should be a shelter to the fruit while it
ripens, and so that also perishes and comes to nothing. They eat the
very bark of the fig-tree, and so kill it. Thus the fig-tree does not
blossom, nor is there fruit in the vine.

III\. A call to the drunkards to lament this judgment ([Joe
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#005).md): Awake and weep, all you drinkers
of wine. This intimates, 1. That they should suffer very sensibly by
this calamity. It should touch them in a tender part; the new wine which
they loved so well should be cut off from their mouth. Note, It is just
with God to take away those comforts which are abused to luxury and
excess, to recover the corn and wine which are prepared for Baal, which
are made the food and fuel of a base lust. And to them judgments of that
kind are most grievous. The more men place their happiness in the
gratification of sense the more pressing temporal afflictions are upon
them. The drinkers of water need not to care when the vine was laid
waste; they could live as well without it as they had done; it was no
trouble to the Nazarites. But the drinkers of wine will weep and howl.
The more delights we make necessary to our satisfaction the more we
expose ourselves to trouble and disappointment. 2. It intimates that
they had been very senseless and stupid under the former tokens of God's
displeasure; and therefore they are here called to awake and weep. Those
that will not be roused out of their security by the word of God shall
be roused by his rod; those that will not be startled by judgments at a
distance shall be themselves arrested by them; and when they are going
to partake of the forbidden fruit a prohibition of another nature shall
come between the cup and the lip, and cut off the wine from their mouth.

[Joel 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joe 1:8</span></span>

The judgment is here described as very lamentable, and such as all sorts
of people should share in; it shall not only rob the drunkards of their
pleasure (if that were the worst of it, it might be the better borne),
but it shall deprive others of their necessary subsistence, who are
therefore called to lament ([Joe 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#008).md),
as a virgin laments the death of her lover to whom she was espoused, but
not completely married, yet so that he was in effect her husband, or as
a young woman lately married, from whom the husband of her youth, her
young husband, or the husband to whom she was married when she was
young, is suddenly taken away by death. Between a new-married couple
that are young, that married for love, and that are every way amiable
and agreeable to each other, there is great fondness, and consequently
great grief if either be taken away. Such lamentation shall there be for
the loss of their corn and wine. Note, The more we are wedded to our
creature-comforts that harder it is to part with them. See that parallel
place, [Isa 32:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#010.md). Two sorts of
people are here brought in, as concerned to lament this devastation,
countrymen and clergymen.

I. Let the husbandmen and vine-dressers lament, [Joe
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#011.md). Let them be ashamed of the care
and pains they have taken about their vineyards, for it will be all
labour lost, and they shall gain no advantage by it; they shall see the
fruit of their labour eaten up before their eyes, and shall not be able
to save any of it. Note, Those who labour only for the meat that
perishes will, sooner or later, be ashamed of their labour. The
vine-dressers will then express their extreme grief by howling, when
they see their vineyards stripped of leaves and fruit, and the vines
withered, so that nothing is to be had or hoped for from them, wherewith
they might pay their rent and maintain their families. The destruction
is particularly described here: The field is laid waste ([Joe
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#010).md); all is consumed that is
produced; the land mourns; the ground has a melancholy aspect, and looks
ruefully; all the inhabitants of the land are in tears for what they
have lost, are in fear of perishing for want, [Isa
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#004.md); [Jer
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#028.md). "The corn, the bread-corn, which
is the staff of life, is wasted; the new wine, which should be brought
into the cellars for a supply when the old is drunk, is dried up, is
ashamed of having promised so fair what it is not now able to perform;
the oil languishes, or is diminished, because (as the Chaldee renders
it) the olives have fallen off." The people were not thankful to God as
they should have been for the bread that strengthens man's heart, the
wine that makes glad the heart, and the oil that makes the face to shine
([Psa 104:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#014.md), [Psa
104:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#015).md); and therefore they are justly
brought to lament the loss and want of them, of all the products of the
earth, which God had given either for necessity or for delight (this is
repeated, [Joe 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#011.md), [Joe
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#012).md) - the wheat and barley, the two
principal grains bread was then made of, wheat for the rich and barley
for the poor, so that the rich and poor meet together in the calamity.
The trees are destroyed, not only the vine and the fig-tree (as before,
[Joe 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#007).md), which were more useful and
necessary, but other trees also that were for delight - the pomegranate,
palm-tree, and apple-tree, yea, all the trees of the field, as well as
those of the orchard, timber-trees as well as fruit-trees. In short, all
the harvest of the field has perished, [Joe
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#011.md). And by this means joy has
withered away from the children of men ([Joe
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#011).md); the joy of harvest, which is
used to express great and general joy, has come to nothing, is turned
into shame, is turned into lamentation. Note, The perishing of the
harvest is the withering of the joy of the children of men. Those that
place their happiness in the delights of the sense, when they are
deprived of them, or in any way disturbed in the enjoyment of them, lose
all their joy; whereas the children of God, who look upon the pleasures
of sense with holy indifference and contempt, and know what it is to
make God their hearts' delight, can rejoice in him as the God of their
salvation even when the fig-tree does not blossom; spiritual joy is so
far from withering then, that it flourishes more than ever, [Hab
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#017.md), [Hab
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#018.md). Let us see here, 1. What
perishing uncertain things all our creature-comforts are. We can never
be sure of the continuance of them. Here the heavens had given their
rains in due season, the earth had yielded her strength, and, when the
appointed weeks of harvest were at hand, they saw no reason to doubt but
that they should have a very plentiful crop; yet then they are invaded
by these unthought-of enemies, that lay all waste, and not by fire and
sword. It is our wisdom not to lay up our treasure in those things which
are liable to so many untoward accidents. 2. See what need we have to
live in continual dependence upon God and his providence, for our own
hands are not sufficient for us. When we see the full corn in the ear,
and think we are sure of it - nay, when we have brought it home, if he
blow upon it, nay, if he do not bless it, we are not likely to have any
good of it. 3. See what ruinous work sin makes. A paradise is turned
into a wilderness, a fruitful land, the most fruitful land upon earth,
into barrenness, for the iniquity of those that dwelt therein.

II\. Let the priests, the Lord's ministers, lament, for they share
deeply in the calamity: Gird yourselves with sackcloth ([Joe
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#013).md); nay, they do mourn, [Joe
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#009.md). Observe, The priests are called
the ministers of the altar, for on that they attended, and the ministers
of the Lord (of my God, says the prophet), for in attending on the altar
they served him, did is work, and did him honour. Note, Those that are
employed in holy things are therein God's ministers, and on him they
attend. The ministers of the altar used to rejoice before the Lord, and
to spend their time very much in singing; but now they must lament and
howl, for the meat-offering and drink-offering were cut off from the
house of the Lord ([Joe 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#009).md), and the
same again ([Joe 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#013).md), from the house
of your God. "He is your God in a particular manner; you are in a nearer
relation to him than other Israelites are; and therefore it is expected
that you should be more concerned than others for that which is a
hindrance to the service of his sanctuary." It is intimated, 1. That the
people, as long as they had the fruits of the earth brought in in their
season, presented to the Lord his dues out of them, and brought the
offerings to the altar and tithes to those that served at the altar.
Note, A people may be filling up the measure of their iniquity apace,
and yet may keep up a course of external performances in religion. 2.
That, when the meat and drink failed, the meat-offering and
drink-offering failed of course; and this was the sorest instance of the
calamity. Note, As far as any public trouble is an obstruction to the
course of religion it is to be upon that account, more than any other,
sadly lamented, especially by the priests, the Lord's ministers. As far
as poverty occasions the decay of piety and the neglect of divine
offices, and starves the cause of religion among a people, it is indeed
a sore judgment. When the famine prevailed God could not have his
sacrifices, nor could the priests have their maintenance; and therefore
let the Lord's ministers mourn.

[Joel 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joe 1:14</span></span>

We have observed abundance of tears shed for the destruction of the
fruits of the earth by the locusts; now here we have those tears turned
into the right channel, that of repentance and humiliation before God.
The judgment was very heavy, and here they are directed to own the hand
of God in it, his mighty hand, and to humble themselves under it. Here
is,

I. A proclamation issued out for a general fast. The priests are ordered
to appoint one; they must not only mourn themselves, but they must call
upon others to mourn too: "Sanctify a fast; let some time be set apart
from all worldly business to be spent in the exercises of religion, in
the expressions of repentance and other extraordinary instances of
devotion." Note, Under public judgments there ought to be public
humiliations; for by them the Lord God calls to weeping and mourning.
With all the marks of sorrow and shame sin must be confessed and
bewailed, the righteous of God must be acknowledged, and his favour
implored. Observe what is to be done by a nation at such a time. 1. A
day is to be appointed for this purpose, a day of restraint (so the
margin reads it), a day in which people must be restrained from their
other ordinary business (that they may more closely attend God's
service), and from all bodily refreshments; for, 2. It must be a fast, a
religious abstaining from meat and drink, further than is of absolute
necessity. The king of Nineveh appointed a fast, in which they were to
taste nothing, [Jon 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#007.md). Hereby we own
ourselves unworthy of our necessary food, and that we have forfeited it
and deserve to be wholly deprived of it, we punish ourselves and mortify
the body, which has been the occasion of sin, we keep it in a frame fit
to serve the soul in serving God, and, by the appetite's craving food,
the desires of the soul towards that which is better than life, and all
the supports of it, are excited. This was in a special manner seasonable
now that God was depriving them of their meat and drink; for hereby they
accommodated themselves to the affliction they were under. When God
says, You shall fast, it is time to say, We will fast. 3. There must be
a solemn assembly. The elders and the people, magistrates and subjects,
must be gathered together, even all the inhabitants of the land, that
God might be honoured by their public humiliations, that they might
thereby take the more shame to themselves, and that they might excite
and stir up one another to the religious duties of the day. All had
contributed to the national guilt, all shared in the national calamity,
and therefore they must all join in the professions of repentance. 4.
They must come together in the temple, the house of the Lord their God,
because that was the house of prayer, and there they might be hope to
meet with God because it was the place which he had chosen to put his
name there, there they might hope to speed because it was a type of
Christ and his mediation. Thus they interested themselves in Solomon's
prayer for the acceptance of all the requests that should be put up in
or towards this house, in which their present case was particularly
mentioned. [Kg1 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#037.md), If there be
locust, if there be caterpillar. 5. They must sanctify this fast, must
observe it in a religious manner, with sincere devotion. What is a fast
worth if it be not sanctified? 6. They must cry unto the Lord. To him
they must make their complaint and offer up their supplication. When we
cry in our affliction we must cry to the Lord; this is fasting to him,
[Zac 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#005.md).

II\. Some considerations suggested to induce them to proclaim this fast
and to observe it strictly.

1\. God was beginning a controversy with them. It is time to cry unto
the Lord, for the day of the Lord is at hand, [Joe
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#015.md). Either they mean the continuance
and consequences of this present judgment which they now saw but
breaking in upon them, or some greater judgments which this was but a
preface to. However it be, this they are taught to make the matter of
their lamentation: Alas, for the day! for the day of the Lord is at
hand. Therefore cry to God. For, (1.) "The day of his judgment is very
near, it is at hand; it will not slumber, and therefore you should not.
It is time to fast and pray, for you have but a little time to turn
yourselves in." (2.) It will be very terrible; there is no escaping it,
no resisting it: As a destruction from the Almighty shall it come. See
[Isa 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#006.md). It is not a correction, but
a destruction; and it comes from the hand, not of a weak creature, but
of the Almighty; and who knows (nay, who does not know) the power of his
anger? Whither should we go with our cries but to him from whom the
judgment we dread comes? There is no fleeing from him but by fleeing to
him, no escaping destruction from the Almighty but by making our
submission and supplication to the Almighty; this is taking hold on his
strength, that we may make peace, [Isa
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#005.md).

2\. They saw themselves already under the tokens of his displeasure. It
is time to fast and pray, for their distress is very great, [Joe
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#016). (1..md) Let them look into their
own houses, and was no plenty there, as used to be. Those who kept a
good table were now obliged to retrench: Is not the meat cut off before
our eyes? If, when God's hand is lifted up, men will not see, when his
hand is laid on they shall see. Is not the meat many a time cut off
before our eyes? Let us then labour for that spiritual meat which is not
before our eyes, and which cannot be cut off. (2.) Let them look into
God's house, and see the effects of the judgment there; joy and gladness
were cut off from the house of God. Note, The house of our God is the
proper place of joy and gladness; when David goes to the altar of God,
it is to God my exceeding joy; but when joy and gladness are cut off
from God's house, either by corruption of holy things or the persecution
of holy persons, when serious godly decays and love waxes cold, then it
time to cry to the Lord, time to cry, Alas!

3\. The prophet returns to describe the grievousness of the calamity, in
some particulars of it. Corn and cattle are the husbandman's staple
commodities; now here he is deprived of both. (1.) The caterpillars have
devoured the corn, [Joe 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#017.md). The
garners, which they used to fill with corn, are laid desolate, and the
barns broken down, because the corn has withered, and the owners think
it not worth while to be at the charge of repairing them when they have
nothing to put in them, nor are likely to have any thing; for the seed
it rotten under the clods, either through too much rain or (which was
the more common case in Canaan) for want of rain, or perhaps some
insects under ground ate it up. When one crop fails the husbandman hopes
the next may make it up; but here they despair of that, the seedness
being as bad as the harvest. (2.) The cattle perish too for want of
grass ([Joe 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#018).md): How do the beasts
groan! This the prophet takes notice of, that the people might be
affected with it and lay to heart the judgment. The groans of the cattle
should soften their hard and impenitent hearts. The herds of cattle, the
large cattle (black cattle we call them), are perplexed; nay, even the
flocks of sheep, which will live upon a common and be content with very
short grass, are made desolate. See here the inferior creatures
suffering for our transgression, and groaning under the double burden of
being serviceable to the sin of man and subject to the curse of God for
it. Cursed is the ground for thy sake.

III\. The prophet stirs them up to cry to God, with the consideration of
the examples given them for it.

1\. His own example ([Joe 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#019).md): O
Lord! to thee will I cry. He would not put them upon doing that which he
would not resolve to do himself; nay, whether they would do it or no, he
would. Note, If God's ministers cannot prevail to affect others with the
discoveries of divine wrath, yet they ought to be themselves affected
with them; if they cannot bring others to cry to God, yet they
themselves be much in prayer. In time of trouble we must not only pray,
but cry, must be fervent and importunate in prayer; and to God, from
whom both the destruction is and the salvation must be, ought our cry to
be always directed. That which engaged him to cry to God was, not so
much any personal affliction, as the national calamity: The fire has
devoured the pastures of the wilderness, which seems to be meant of some
parching scorching heat of the sun, which was as fire to the fruits of
the earth; it consumed them all. Note, When God calls to contend by fire
it concerns those that have any interest in heaven to cry mightily to
him for relief. See [Num 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#002.md); [Amo
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#004.md), [Amo
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#005.md).

2\. The example of the inferior creatures: "The beasts of the field do
not only groan, but cry unto thee, [Joe
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#020.md). They appeal to thy pity,
according to their capacity, and as if, though they are not capable of a
rational and revealed religion, yet they had something of dependence
upon God by natural instinct." At least, when they groan by reason of
their calamity, he is pleased to interpret it as if they cried to him;
much more will he put a favourable construction upon the groanings of
his own children, though sometimes so feeble that they cannot be
uttered, [Rom 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026.md). The beasts are
here said to cry unto God, as from him the lions seek their meat ([Psa
104:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#021).md) and the young ravens, [Job
38:41](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#041.md). The complaints of the
brute-creatures here are for want of water (The rivers are dried up,
through the excessive heat), and for want of grass, for the fire has
devoured the pastures of the wilderness. And what better are those than
beasts who never cry to God but for corn and wine, and complain of
