An Exposition, with Practical Observations, of The First Epistle General
of John

Though the continued tradition of the church attests that this epistle
came from John the apostle, yet we may observe some other evidence that
will confirm (or with some perhaps even outweigh) the certainty of that
tradition. It should seem that the penman was one of the apostolical
college by the sensible palpable assurance he had of the truth of the
Mediator's person in his human nature: That which we have heard, which
we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands
have handled, of the Word of life, [Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001.md). Here he takes notice of the
evidence the Lord gave to Thomas of his resurrection, by calling him to
feel the prints of the nails and of the spear, which is recorded by
John. And he must have been one of the disciples present when the Lord
came on the same day in which he arose from the dead, and showed them
his hands and his side, [Joh 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#020.md).
But, that we may be assured which apostle this was, there is scarcely a
critic or competent judge of diction, or style of argument and spirit,
but will adjudge this epistle to the writer of that gospel that bears
the name of the apostle John. They wonderfully agree in the titles and
characters of the Redeemer: The Word, the Life, the Light; his name was
the Word of God. Compare [Jo1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001.md) and
[Jo1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#007.md) with [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md) and [Rev
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#013.md). They agree in the commendation
of God's love to us ([Jo1 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#009.md); [Jo1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007.md); and [Jo1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001.md); [Joh
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005.md), [Joh
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006).md). Lastly (to add no more
instances, which may be easily seen in comparing this epistle with that
gospel), they agree in the allusion to, or application of, that passage
in that gospel which relates (and which alone relates) the issuing of
water and blood out of the Redeemer's opened side: This is he that came
by water and blood, [Jo1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006.md). Thus the
epistle plainly appears to flow from the same pen as that gospel did.
Now I know not that the text, or the intrinsic history of any of the
gospels, gives us such assurance of its writer or penman as that
ascribed to John plainly does. There (viz. [Joh
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#024).md) the sacred historian thus
notifies himself: This is the disciple that testifieth of these things
and wrote these things; and we know that his testimony is true. Now who
is this disciple, but he concerning whom Peter asked, What shall this
man do? And concerning whom the Lord answered, If I will that he tarry
till I come, what is that to thee? ([Joh
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#022).md). And who ([Joh
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#020).md) is described by these three
characters: - 1. That he is the disciple whom Jesus loved, the Lord's
peculiar friend. 2. That he also leaned on his breast at supper. 3. That
he said unto him, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee? As sure then as
it is that that disciple was John, so sure may the church be that that
gospel and this epistle came from the beloved John.

The epistle is styled general, as being not inscribed to any particular
church; it is, as a circular letter (or visitation charge), sent to
divers churches (some say of Parthia), in order to confirm them in their
stedfast adherence to the Lord Christ, and the sacred doctrines
concerning his person and office, against seducers; and to instigate
them to adorn that doctrine by love to God and man, and particularly to
each other, as being descended from God, united by the same head, and
travelling towards the same eternal life.
