### [Psalms Chapter 68](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 68:0</span></span>

This is a most excellent psalm, but in many places the genuine sense is
not easy to come at; for in this, as in some other scriptures, there are
things dark and hard to be understood. It does not appear when, or upon
what occasion, David penned this psalm; but probably it was when, God
having given him rest from all his enemies round about, he brought the
ark (which was both the token of God's presence and a type of Christ's
mediation) from the house of Obed-edom to the tent he had pitched for it
in Zion; for the first words are the prayer which Moses used at the
removing of the ark, [Num 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#035.md). From
this he is led, by the Spirit of prophecy, to speak glorious things
concerning the Messiah, his ascension into heaven, and the setting up of
his kingdom in the world. I. He begins with prayer, both against God's
enemies ([Psa 68:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#001.md), [Psa
68:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#002).md) and for his people ([Psa
68:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#003).md). II. He proceeds to praise,
which takes up the rest of the psalm, calling upon all to praise God
([Psa 68:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#004.md), [Psa
68:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#026.md), [Psa
68:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#032).md) and suggesting many things as
matter for praise. 1. The greatness and goodness of God ([Psa
68:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#004).md). 2. The wonderful works God
had wrought for his people formerly, bringing them through the
wilderness ([Psa 68:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#007.md), [Psa
68:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#008).md), settling them in Canaan ([Psa
68:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#009.md), [Psa
68:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#010).md), giving them victory over their
enemies ([Psa 68:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#011.md), [Psa
68:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#012).md), and delivering them out of the
hands of their oppressors ([Psa 68:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#013.md),
[Psa 68:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#014).md). 3. The special presence
of God in his church ([Psa 68:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#015).md).
4. The ascension of Christ ([Psa
68:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018).md) and the salvation of his people
by him ([Psa 68:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#019.md), [Psa
68:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#020).md). 5. The victories which Christ
would obtain over his enemies, and the favours he would bestow upon his
church ([Psa 68:21-28](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#021).md). 6. The
enlargement of the church by the accession of the Gentiles to it ([Psa
68:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#029).md). And so he concludes the
psalm with an awful acknowledgment of the glory and grace of God ([Psa
68:32-35](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#032).md). With all these great things
we should endeavour to be duly affected in singing this psalm.

To the chief musician. A psalm or song of David.

[Psalms 68:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 68:1</span></span>

In these verses,

I. David prays that God would appear in his glory,

1\. For the confusion of his enemies ([Psa
68:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#001.md), [Psa
68:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#002).md): "Let God arise, as a judge to
pass sentence upon them, as a general to take the field and do execution
upon them; and let them be scattered, and flee before him, as unable to
keep their ground, much less to make head against him. Let God arise, as
the sun when he goes forth in his strength; and the children of darkness
shall be scattered, as the shadows of the evening flee before the rising
sun. Let them be driven away as smoke by the wind, which ascends as if
it would eclipse the sun, but is presently dispelled, and there appears
to remainder of it. Let them melt as wax before the fire, which is
quickly dissolved." Thus does David comment upon Moses's prayer, and not
only repeat it with application to himself and his own times, but
enlarge upon it, to direct us how to make use of scripture-prayers. Nay,
it looks further, to the Redeemer's victory over the enemies of this
kingdom, for he was the angel of the covenant, that guided Israel
through the wilderness. Note, (1.) There are, and have been, and ever
will be, such as are enemies to God and hate him, that join in with the
old serpent against the kingdom of God among men and against the seed of
the woman. (2.) They are the wicked, and none but the wicked, that are
enemies to God, the children of the wicked one. (3.) Though we are to
pray for our enemies as such, yet we are to pray against God's enemies
as such, against their enmity to him and all their attempts upon his
kingdom. (4.) If God but arise, all his impenitent and implacable
enemies, that will not repent to give him glory, will certainly and
speedily be scattered, and driven away, and made to perish at his
presence; for none ever hardened his heart against God and prospered.
The day of judgment will be the day of the complete and final perdition
of ungodly men ([Pe2 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#007).md), who shall
melt like wax before that flaming fire in which the Lord shall then
appear, [Th2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#008.md).

2\. For the comfort and joy of his own people ([Psa
68:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#003).md): "Let the righteous be glad,
that are now in sorrow; let them rejoice before God in his favourable
presence. God is the joy of his people; let them rejoice whenever they
come before God, yea, let them exceedingly rejoice, let them rejoice
with gladness." Note, Those who rejoice in God have reason to rejoice
with exceeding joy; and this joy we ought to wish to all the saints, for
it belongs to them. Light is sown for the righteous.

II\. He praises God for his glorious appearances, and calls upon us to
praise him, to sing to his name, and extol him,

1\. As a great God, infinitely great ([Psa
68:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#004).md): He rides upon the heavens, by
his name JAH. He is the spring of all the motions of the heavenly
bodies, directs and manages them, as he that rides in the chariot sets
it a-going, has a supreme command of the influences of heaven; he rides
upon the heavens for the help of his people ([Deu
33:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#026).md), so swiftly, so strongly, and
so much above the reach of opposition. He rules these by his name Jah,
or Jehovah, a self-existent self-sufficient being; the fountain of all
being, power, motion, and perfection; this is his name for ever. When we
thus extol God we must rejoice before him. Holy joy in God will very
well consist with that reverence and godly fear wherewith we ought to
worship him.

2\. As a gracious God, a God of mercy and tender compassion. He is
great, but he despises not any, no, not the meanest; nay, being a God of
great power, he uses his power for the relief of those that are
distressed, [Psa 68:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#005.md), [Psa
68:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#006.md). The fatherless, the widows, the
solitary, find him a God all-sufficient to them. Observe how much God's
goodness is his glory. He that rides on the heavens by his name Jah, one
would think should immediately have been adored as King of kings and
Lord of lords, and the sovereign director of all the affairs of states
and nations; he is so, but this he rather glories in, that he is a
Father of the fatherless. Though God be high, yet has he respect unto
the lowly. Happy are those that have an interest in such a God as this.
He that rides upon the heavens is a Father worth having; thrice happy
are the people whose God is the Lord. (1.) When families are bereaved of
their head God takes care of them, and is himself their head; and the
widows and the fatherless children shall find that in him which they
have lost in the relation that is removed, and infinitely more and
better. He is a Father of the fatherless, to pity them, to bless them,
to teach them, to provide for them, to portion them. He will preserve
them alive ([Jer 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#011).md), and with him
they shall find mercy, [Hos 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#003.md). They
have liberty to call him Father, and to plead their relation to him as
their guardian, [Psa 146:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#009.md); [Psa
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#014.md), [Psa
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#018.md). He is a judge or patron of the
widows, to give them counsel and to redress their grievances, to own
them and plead their cause, [Pro
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#023.md). He has an ear open to all their
complaints and a hand open to all their wants. He is so in his holy
habitation, which may be understood either of the habitation of his
glory in heaven (there he has prepared his throne of judgment, which the
fatherless and widow have free recourse to, and are taken under the
protection of, [Psa 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#004.md), [Psa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#007).md), or of the habitation of his
grace on earth; and so it is a direction to the widows and fatherless
how to apply to God; let them go to his holy habitation, to his word and
ordinances; there they may find him and find comfort in him. (2.) When
families are to be built up he is the founder of them: God sets the
solitary in families, brings those into comfortable relations that were
lonely, gives those a convenient settlement that were unsettled ([Psa
113:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#009).md); he makes those dwell at home
that were forced to seek for relief abroad (so Dr. Hammond), putting
those that were destitute into a way of getting their livelihood, which
is a very good way for man's charity, as it is of God's bounty.

3\. As a righteous God, (1.) In relieving the oppressed. He brings out
those that are bound with chains, and sets those at liberty who were
unjustly imprisoned and brought into servitude. No chains can detain
those whom God will make free. (2.) In reckoning with the oppressors:
The rebellious dwell in a dry land and have no comfort in that which
they have got by fraud and injury. The best land will be a dry land to
those that by their rebellion have forfeited the blessing of God, which
is the juice and fatness of all our enjoyments. The Israelites were
brought out of Egypt into the wilderness, but were there better provided
for than the Egyptians themselves, whose land, if Nilus failed them, as
it sometimes did, was a dry land.

[Psalms 68:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 68:7</span></span>

The psalmist here, having occasion to give God thanks for the great
things he had done for him and his people of late, takes occasion thence
to praise him for what he had done for their fathers in the days of old.
Fresh mercies should put us in mind of former mercies and revive our
grateful sense of them. Let it never be forgotten,

I. That God himself was the guide of Israel through the wilderness; when
he had brought them out of their chains he did not leave them in the dry
land, but he himself went before them in a march through the wilderness,
[Psa 68:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#007.md). It was not a journey, but a
march, for they went as soldiers, as an army with banners. The Egyptians
promised themselves that the wilderness had shut them in, but they were
deceived; God's Israel, having him for their leader, marched through the
wilderness and were not lost in it. Note, If God bring his people into a
wilderness, he will be sure to go before them in it and bring them out
of it. [Sol 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#005.md).

II\. That he manifested his glorious presence with them at Mount Sinai,
[Psa 68:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#008.md). Never did any people see
the glory of God, nor hear his voice, as Israel did, [Deu
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#032.md), [Deu
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#033.md). Never had any people such an
excellent law given them, so expounded, so enforced. Then the earth
shook, and the neighbouring countries, it is likely, felt the shock;
terrible thunders there were, accompanied no doubt with thunder-showers,
in which the heavens seemed to drop; while the divine doctrine dropped
as the rain, [Deu 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002.md). Sinai itself,
that vast mountain, that long ridge of mountains, was moved at the
presence of God; see [Jdg 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#004.md), [Jdg
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#005.md); [Deu
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002.md); [Hab
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#003.md). This terrible appearance of the
Divine Majesty, as it would possess them with a fear and dread of him,
so it would encourage their faith in him and dependence upon him.
Whatever mountains of difficulty lay in the way of their happy
settlement, he that could move Sinai itself could remove them, could get
over them.

III\. That he provided very comfortably for them both in the wilderness
and in Canaan ([Psa 68:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#009.md), [Psa
68:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#010).md): Thou didst send a plentiful
rain and hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor. This may refer, 1.
To the victualling of their camp with manna in the wilderness, which was
rained upon them, as were also the quails ([Psa
78:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#024.md), [Psa
78:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#027).md), and it might be fitly called a
rain of liberality or munificence, for it was a memorable instance of
the divine bounty. This confirmed the camp of Israel (here called God's
inheritance, because he had chosen them to be a peculiar treasure to
himself) when it was weary and ready to perish: this confirmed their
faith, and was a standing proof of God's power and goodness. Even in the
wilderness God found a comfortable dwelling for Israel, which was his
congregation. Or, 2. To the seasonable supplies granted them in Canaan,
that land flowing with mild and honey, which is said to drink water of
the rain of heaven, [Deu 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#011.md). When
sometimes that fruitful land was ready to be turned into barrenness, for
the iniquity of those that dwelt therein, God, in judgment, remembered
mercy, and sent them a plentiful rain, which refreshed it again, so that
the congregation of Israel dwelt therein, and there was provision
enough, even to satisfy their poor with bread. This looks further to the
spiritual provision made for God's Israel; the Spirit of grace and the
gospel of grace are the plentiful rain with which God confirms his
inheritance, and from which their fruit is found, [Isa
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008.md). Christ himself is this rain,
[Psa 72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006.md). He shall come as showers
that water the earth.

IV\. That he often gave them victory over their enemies; armies, and
kings of armies, appeared against them, from their first coming into
Canaan, and all along in the times of the judges, till David's days,
but, first or last, they gained their point against them, [Psa
68:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#011.md), [Psa
68:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#012.md), [Psa
68:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#014.md). Observe here, 1. That God was
their commander-in-chief: The Lord gave the word, as general of their
armies. He raised up judges for them, gave them their commissions and
instructions, and assured them of success. God spoke in his holiness,
and then Gilead is mine. 2. That they had prophets, as God's messengers,
to make known his mind to them. God gave them his word (the word of the
Lord came unto them) and then great was the company of the preachers -
prophets and prophetesses, for the word is feminine. When God has
messages to send he will not want messengers. Or perhaps it may allude
to the women's joining in the triumph when the victory was obtained, as
was usual ([Exo 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020.md), [Sa1
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#007).md), in which they took notice of
the word of God, triumphing in that as much as in his works. 3. That
their enemies were defeated, and put to confusion: Kings of armies did
flee, did flee with the greatest terror and precipitation imaginable,
did not fight and flee, but flee and flee, retired without striking a
stroke; they fled apace, fled and never rallied again. 4. That they were
enriched with the plunder of the field: She that tarried at home divided
the spoil. Not only the men, the soldiers that abode by the stuff, who
were, by a statute of distributions, to share the prey ([Sa1
30:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#024).md), but even the women that
tarried at home had a share, which intimates the abundance of spoil that
should be taken. 5. That these great things which God did for them were
sanctified to them and contributed to their reformation ([Psa
68:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#014).md): When the Almighty scattered
kings for her (for the church) she was white as snow in Salmon, purified
and refined by the mercies of God; when the host went forth against the
enemy they kept themselves from every wicked thing, and so the host
returned victorious, and Israel by the victory were confirmed in their
purity and piety. This account of Israel's victories is applicable to
the victories obtained by the exalted Redeemer for those that are his,
over death and hell. By the resurrection of Christ our spiritual enemies
were made to flee, their power was broken, and they were for ever
disabled to hurt any of God's people. This victory was first notified by
the women (the she-publishers) to the disciples ([Mat
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#007).md) and by them it was preached to
all the world, while believers that tarry at home, that did not
themselves contribute any thing towards it, enjoy the benefit of it, and
divide the spoil.

V. That from a low and despised condition they had been advanced to
splendour and prosperity. When they were bond-slaves in Egypt, and
afterwards when they were oppressed sometimes by one potent neighbour
and sometimes by another, they did, as it were, lie among the pots or
rubbish, as despised broken vessels, or as vessels in which there was no
pleasure - they were black, and dirty, and discoloured. But God, at
length, delivered them from the pots ([Psa
81:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#006).md), and in David's time they were
in a fair way to be one of the most prosperous kingdoms in the world,
amiable in the eyes of all about them, like the wings of a dove covered
with silver, [Psa 68:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#013.md). "And so,"
says Dr. Hammond, "under Christ's kingdom, the heathen idolaters that
were brought to the basest and most despicable condition of any
creatures, worshipping wood and stone, and given up to the vilest lusts,
should from that detestable condition be advanced to the service of
Christ, and the practice of all Christian virtues, the greatest inward
beauties in the world." It may be applied also to the deliverance of the
church out of a suffering state and the comforts of particular believers
after their despondencies.

[Psalms 68:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 68:15</span></span>

David, having given God praise for what he had done for Israel in
general, as the God of Israel ([Psa
68:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#008).md), here comes to give him praise
as Zion's God in a special manner; compare [Psa
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#011.md). Sing praises to the Lord who
dwelleth in Zion, for which reason Zion is called the hill of God.

I. He compares it with the hill of Bashan and other high and fruitful
hills, and prefers it before them, [Psa
68:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#015.md), [Psa
68:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#016.md). It is true, Zion was but little
and low in comparison with them, and was not covered over with flocks
and herds as they were, yet, upon this account, it has the pre-eminence
above them all, that it is the hill of God, the hill which he desires to
dwell in, and where he chooses to manifest the tokens of his peculiar
presence, [Psa 132:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#013.md), [Psa
132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014.md). Note, It is much more
honourable to be holy to God than to be high and great in the world.
"Why leap you, you high hills? Why do you insult over poor Zion, and
boast of your own height? This is the hill which God has chosen, and
therefore though you exceed it in bulk, and be first-rates, yet, because
on this the royal flag is hoisted, you must all strike sail to it." Zion
was especially honourable because it was a type of the gospel church,
which is therefore called Mount Zion ([Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022).md), and this is intimated here,
when he said, The Lord will dwell in it for ever, which must have its
accomplishment in the gospel Zion. There is no kingdom in the world
comparable to the kingdom of the Redeemer, no city comparable to that
which is incorporated by the gospel charter, for there God dwells and
will dwell for ever.

II\. He compares it with Mount Sinai, of which he had spoken ([Psa
68:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#008).md), and shows that it has the
Shechinah or divine presence in it as really, though not as sensibly, as
Sinai itself had, [Psa 68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017.md). Angels
are the chariots of God, his chariots of war, which he make use of
against his enemies, his chariots of conveyance, which he sends for his
friends, as he did for Elijah (and Lazarus is said to be carried by the
angels), his chariots of state, in the midst of which he shows his glory
and power. They are vastly numerous: Twenty thousands, even thousands
multiplied. There is an innumerable company of angels in the heavenly
Jerusalem, [Heb 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022.md). The enemies
David fought with had chariots ([Sa2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#004).md), but what were they, for number
or strength, to the chariots of God? While David had these on his side
he needed not to fear those that trusted in chariots and horses, [Psa
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007.md). God appeared on Mount Sinai,
attended with myriads of angels, by whose dispensation the law was
given, [Act 7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053.md). He comes with ten
thousands of saints, [Deu 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002.md). And
still in Zion God manifests his glory, and is really present, with a
numerous retinue of his heavenly hosts, signified by the cherubim
between which God is said to dwell. So that, as some read the last words
of the verse, Sinai is in the sanctuary; that is, the sanctuary was to
Israel instead of Mount Sinai, whence they received divine oracles. Our
Lord Jesus has these chariots at command. When the first-begotten was
brought into the world it was with this charge, Let all the angels of
God worship him ([Heb 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006).md); they
attended him upon all occasions, and he is now among them, angels,
principalities, and powers, being made subject to him, [Pe1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#022.md). And it is intimated in the New
Testament that the angels are present in the solemn religious assemblies
of Christians, [Co1 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#010.md). Let the
woman have a veil on her head because of the angels; and see [Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010.md).

III\. The glory of Mount Zion was the King whom God set on that holy
hill ([Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006).md), who came to the
daughter of Zion, [Mat 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#005.md). Of his
ascension the psalmist here speaks, and to it his language is expressly
applied ([Eph 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008).md): Thou hast ascended
on high ([Psa 68:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018).md); compare [Psa
47:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#005.md), [Psa
47:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#006.md). Christ's ascending on high is
here spoken of as a thing past, so sure was it; and spoken of to his
honour, so great was it. It may include his whole exalted state, but
points especially at his ascension into heaven to the right hand of the
Father, which was as much our advantage as his advancement. For, 1. He
then triumphed over the gates of hell. He led captivity captive; that
is, he led his captives in triumph, as great conquerors used to do,
making a show of them openly, [Col
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015.md). He led those captive who had led
us captive, and who, if he had not interposed, would have held us
captive for ever. Nay, he led captivity itself captive, having quite
broken the power of sin and Satan. As he was the death of death, so he
was the captivity of captivity, [Hos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014.md). This intimates the complete
victory which Jesus Christ obtained over our spiritual enemies; it was
such that through him we also are more than conquerors, that is,
triumphers, [Rom 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#037.md). 2. He then
opened the gates of heaven to all believers: Thou hast received gifts
for men. He gave gifts to men, so the apostle reads it, [Eph
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008.md). For he received that he might
give; on his head the anointing of the Spirit was poured, that from him
it might descend to the skirts of his garments. And he gave what he had
received; having received power to give eternal life, he bestows it upon
as many as were given him, [Joh 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#002.md).
Thou hast received gifts for men, not for angels; fallen angels were not
to be made saints, nor standing angels made gospel ministers, [Heb
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#005.md). Not for Jews only, but for all
men; whoever will may reap the benefit of these gifts. The apostle tells
us what these gifts were ([Eph 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011).md),
prophets, apostles, evangelists, pastors and teachers, the institution
of a gospel ministry and the qualification of men for it, both which are
to be valued as the gifts of heaven and the fruits of Christ's
ascension. Thou hast received gifts in man (so the margin), that is, in
the human nature which Christ was pleased to clothe himself with, that
he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to
God. In him, as Mediator, all fulness dwells, that from his fulness we
might receive. To magnify the kindness and love of Christ to us in
receiving these gifts for us, the psalmist observes, (1.) The forfeiture
we had made of them. He received them for the rebellious also, for those
that had been rebellious; so all the children of men had been in their
fallen state. Perhaps it is especially meant of the Gentiles, that had
been enemies in their minds by wicked works, [Col
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#021.md). For them these gifts are
received, to them they are given, that they might lay down their arms,
that their enmity might be slain, and that they might return to their
allegiance. This magnifies the grace of Christ exceedingly that through
him rebels are, upon their submission, not only pardoned, but preferred.
They have commissions given them under Christ, which some say, in our
law, amounts to the reversing of an attainder. Christ came to a
rebellious world, not to condemn it, but that through him it might be
saved. (2.) The favour designed us in them: He received gifts for the
rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell among them, that he might set
up a church in a rebellious world, in which he would dwell by his word
and ordinances, as of old in the sanctuary, that he might set up his
throne, and Christ might dwell in the hearts of particular persons that
had been rebellious. The gracious intention of Christ's undertaking was
to rear up the tabernacle of God among men, that he might dwell with
them and they might themselves be living temples to his praise, [Eze
37:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#027.md).

IV\. The glory of Zion's King is that he is a Saviour and benefactor to
all his willing people and a consuming fire to all those that persist in
rebellion against him, [Psa 68:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#019.md).
We have here good and evil, life and death, the blessing and the curse,
set before us, like that ([Mar 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#016).md),
He that believes shall be saved; he that believes not shall be damned.

1\. Those that take God for their God, and so give up themselves to him
to be his people, shall be loaded with his benefits, and to them he will
be a God of salvation. If in sincerity we avouch God to be our God, and
seek to him as such, (1.) He will continually do us good and furnish us
with occasion for praise. Having mentioned the gifts Christ received for
us ([Psa 68:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018).md), fitly does he
subjoin, in the next words, Blessed be the Lord; for it is owing to the
mediation of Christ that we live, and live comfortably, and are daily
loaded with benefits. So many, so weighty, are the gifts of God's bounty
to us that he may be truly said to load us with them; he pours out
blessings till there is no room to receive them, [Mal
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#010.md). So constant are they, and so
unwearied is he in doing us good, that he daily loads us with them,
according as the necessity of every day requires. (2.) He will at length
be unto us the God of salvation, of everlasting salvation, the salvation
of God, which he will show to those that order their conversation aright
([Psa 50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023).md), the salvation of the
soul. He that daily loads us with benefits will not put us off with
present things for a portion, but will be the God of our salvation; and
what he gives us now he gives as the God of salvation, pursuant to the
great design of our salvation. He is our God, and therefore he will be
the God of eternal salvation to us; for that only will answer the vast
extent of his covenant-relation to us as our God. But has he power to
complete this salvation? Yes, certainly; for unto God the Lord belong
the issues from death. The keys of hell and death are put into the hand
of the Lord Jesus, [Rev 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#018.md). He,
having made an escape from death himself in his resurrection, has both
authority and power to rescue those that are his from the dominion of
death, by altering the property of it to them when they die and giving
them a complete victory over it when they shall rise again; for the last
enemy that shall be destroyed is death. And to those that shall thus for
ever escape death, and shall find such an outlet from it as not to be
hurt of the second death, to them surely deliverances from temporal
death are mercies indeed and come from God as the God of their
salvation. [Co2 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#010.md).

2\. Those that persist in their enmity to him will certainly be ruined
([Psa 68:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#021).md): God shall wound the head
of his enemies, - of Satan the old serpent (of whom it was by the first
promise foretold that the seed of the woman should break his head, [Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015).md), - of all the powers of the
nations, whether Jews or Gentiles, that oppose him and his kingdom among
men ([Psa 110:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#006.md), He shall wound the
heads over many countries), - of all those, whoever they are, that will
not have him to reign over them, for those he accounts his enemies, and
they shall be brought forth and slain before him, [Luk
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#027.md). He will wound the hairy scalp
of such a one as goeth on still in his trespasses. Note, Those who go on
still in their trespasses, and hate to be reformed, God looks upon as
his enemies and will treat them accordingly. In calling the head the
hairy scalp perhaps there is an allusion to Absalom, whose bushy hair
was his halter. Or it denotes either the most fierce and barbarous of
his enemies, who let their hair grow, to make themselves look the more
frightful, or the most fine and delicate of his enemies, who are nice
about their hair: neither the one nor the other can secure themselves
from the fatal wounds which divine justice will give to the heads of
those that go on in their sins.

[Psalms 68:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 68:22</span></span>

In these verses we have three things: -

I. The gracious promise which God makes of the redemption of his people,
and their victory over his and their enemies ([Psa
68:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#022.md), [Psa
68:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#023).md): The Lord said, in his own
gracious purpose and promise, "I will do great things for my people, as
the God of their salvation," [Psa
68:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#020.md). God will not fail the
expectations of those who by faith take him for their God. It is
promised, 1. That he will set them in safety from their danger, as he
had done formerly: "I will again bring them from the depths of the sea,"
as he did Israel when he brought them out of the slavery of Egypt into
the ease and liberty of the wilderness; "and I will again bring them
from Bashan," as he did Israel when he brought them from their wants and
wanderings in the wilderness into the fulness and settlement of the land
of Canaan; for the land of Bashan was on the other side Jordan, where
they had wars with Sihon and Og, and whence their next removal was into
Canaan. Note, The former appearances of God's power and goodness for his
people should encourage their faith and hope in him for the future, that
what he has done he will do again. He will set his hand again the second
time to recover the remnant of his people ([Isa
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011).md); and we may perhaps see
repeated all the wonders which our fathers told us of. But this is not
all: 2. That he will make them victorious over their enemies ([Psa
68:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#023).md): That thy feet may be dipped,
as thou passest along, in the blood of thy enemies, shed like water in
great abundance, and the tongue of thy dogs may lap in the same. Dogs
licked the blood of Ahab; and, in the destruction of the anti-christian
generation, we read of blood up to the horses' bridles, [Rev
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#020.md). The victories with which God
blessed David's forces over the enemies of Israel are here prophesied
of, but as types of Christ's victory over death and the grave for
himself and for all believers, in his resurrection (and theirs by virtue
of his) out of the earth, and of the destruction of the enemies of
Christ and his church, who shall have blood given them to drink, for
they are worthy.

II\. The welcome entertainment which God's own people shall give to
these glorious discoveries of his grace, both in his word and in his
works. Has he spoken in his holiness? Has he said he will bring again
from Bashan? What then is required of us in return to this?

1\. That we observe his motions ([Psa
68:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#024).md): "They have seen, thy people
have seen, thy goings, O God! While others regard not the work of the
Lord, nor the operation of his hands, they have seen the goings of my
God, my King, in the sanctuary." See here, (1.) How an active faith
appropriates God; he is God and King; but that is not all, he is my God
and my King. Those who thus take him for theirs may see him, in all his
outgoings, acting as their God, as their King, for their good, and in
answer to their prayers. (2.) Where God's most remarkable outgoings are,
even in the sanctuary, in and by his word and ordinances, and among his
people in the gospel church especially, in and by which is made known
the manifold wisdom of God. These outgoings of his in the sanctuary far
outshine the outgoings of the morning and the evening, and more loudly
proclaim his eternal power and godhead. (3.) What is our duty in
reference to these outgoings, which is to observe them. This is the
finger of God. Surely God is with us of a truth.

2\. That we give him glory in the most devout and solemn manner. When we
see his goings in his sanctuary, (1.) Let those that are immediately
employed in the service of the temple praise him, [Psa
68:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#025.md). It was expected that the
Levites, some of whom were singers and others players on instruments,
who had the nearest views of his outgoings in his sanctuary, should lead
in his praises. And, it being a day of extraordinary triumph, among them
were damsels playing with timbrels, to complete the concert. "Thus (says
Dr. Hammond) when Christ has gone up to heaven the apostles shall
celebrate and publish it to all the world, and even the women that were
witnesses of it shall affectionately join with them in divulging it."
(2.) Let all the people of Israel in their solemn religious assembly
give glory to God: Bless God, not only in temples, but in the
synagogues, or schools of the prophets, or wherever there is a
congregation of those that come forth from the fountain of Israel, that
are of the seed of Jacob, let them concur in blessing God. Public
mercies, which we jointly share in, call for public thanksgivings, which
all should join in. "Thus (says Dr. Hammond) all Christians shall be
obliged solemnly to magnify the name of the Messiah, and, to that end,
frequently to assemble together in congregations." And, (3.) Let those
among them who, upon any account, are the most eminent, and make a
figure, go before the rest in praising God, [Psa
68:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#027.md). There was little Benjamin (that
was the royal tribe in Saul's time) with their rulers, the princes of
Judah (that was the royal tribe in David's time), and their council,
their captains or leaders. In the beginning of David's reign there had
been long war between Judah and Benjamin, but now they both join in
praises for success against the common enemy. But why are the tribes of
Zebulun and Naphtali particularly mentioned? Perhaps because those
tribes, lying towards the north, lay most exposed to the incursions of
the Syrians, and other neighbours that molested them, and therefore
should be in a particular manner thankful for these victories over them.
Dr. Hammond gives another reason, That these were the two learned
tribes. Naphtali giveth goodly words ([Gen
49:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#021).md) and Zebulun had those that
handle the pen of the writer, [Jdg
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#014.md). These shall join in praising
God, their princes especially. It is much for the honour of God when
those that are above others in dignity, power, and reputation, go before
them in the worship of God and are forward in using their influence and
interest for the advancing of any service that is to be done to him. Dr.
Hammond notes hence that the kingdom of the Messiah should, at length,
be submitted to by all the potentates and learned men in the world.

3\. That we seek unto him, and depend upon him, for the perfecting of
what he has begun, [Psa 68:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#028.md). In the
former part of the verse the psalmist speaks to Israel: "Thy God has
commanded thy strength; that is, whatever is done for thee, or whatever
strength thou hast to help thyself, it comes from God, his power and
grace, and the word which he has commanded; thou hast no reason to fear
while thou hast strength of God's commanding, and no reason to boast
while thou hast no strength but what is of his commanding." In the
latter part he speaks to God, encouraged by his experiences:
"Strengthen, O God! that which thou hast wrought for us. Lord, confirm
what thou hast commanded, perform what thou hast promised, and bring to
a happy end that good work which thou hast so gloriously begun." What
God has wrought he will strengthen; where he has given true grace he
will give more grace. Some make this whole verse to be a believer's
address to the Messiah, whom David calls God, as he had done, [Psa
45:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006.md), [Psa
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#008). "Thy God" (God the Father.md) "has
commanded thy strength, has made thee strong for himself, as the man of
his right hand ([Psa 80:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#017).md), has
treasured up strength in thee for us; therefore we pray that thou, O God
the Son! wilt strengthen what thou hast wrought for us, wilt accomplish
thy undertaking for us by finishing thy good work in us."

III\. The powerful invitation and inducement which would hereby be given
to those that are without to come in and join themselves to the church,
[Psa 68:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#029.md). This was in part
fulfilled by the accession of many proselytes to the Jewish religion in
the days of David and Solomon; but it was to have its full
accomplishment in the conversion of the Gentile nations to the faith of
Christ, and the making of them fellow-heirs, and of the same body, with
the seed of Israel, [Eph 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#006.md). 1. Some
shall submit for fear ([Psa 68:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#030).md):
"The company of spearmen, that stand it out against Christ and his
gospel, that are not willing to be ruled by him, that persecute the
preachers and professors of his name, that are furious and outrageous as
a multitude of bulls, fat and wanton as the calves of the people" (which
is a description of those Jews and Gentiles that opposed the gospel of
Christ and did what they could to prevent the setting up of his kingdom
in the world), "Lord, rebuke them, abate their pride, assuage their
malice, and confound their devices, till, conquered by the convictions
of their consciences and the many checks of providence, they be every
one of them brought, at length, to submit themselves with pieces of
silver, as being glad to make their peace with the church upon any
terms." Even Judas submitted himself with pieces of silver when he
returned them with this confession, I have betrayed innocent blood. And
see [Rev 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#009.md). Many, by being rebuked,
have been happily saved from being ruined. But as for those that will
not submit, notwithstanding these rebukes, he prays for their
dispersion, which amounts to a prophecy of it: Scatter thou the people
that delight in war, who take such a pleasure in opposing Christ that
they will never be reconciled to him. This may refer to the unbelieving
Jews, who delighted in making war upon the holy seed, and would not
submit themselves, and were therefore scattered over the face of the
earth. David had himself been a man of war, but could appeal to God that
he never delighted in war and bloodshed for its own sake; as for those
that did, and therefore would not submit to the fairest terms of peace,
he does not doubt but God would scatter them. Those are lost to all the
sacred principles of humanity, as well as Christianity, that can delight
in war and take a pleasure in contention let them expect that, sooner or
later, they shall have enough of it, [Isa
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001.md); [Rev
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#010.md). 2. Others shall submit
willingly ([Psa 68:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#029.md), [Psa
68:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#031).md): Because of thy temple at
Jerusalem (this David speaks of in faith, for the temple of Jerusalem
was not built in his time, only the materials and model were prepared)
kings shall bring presents unto thee; rich presents shall be brought,
such as are fit for kings to bring; even kings themselves, that stand
much upon the punctilios of honour and prerogative, shall court the
favour of Christ at a great expense. There is that in God's temple, that
beauty and benefit in the service of God and in communion with him, and
in the gospel of Christ which went forth from Jerusalem, that is enough
to invite kings themselves to bring presents to God, to present
themselves to him as living sacrifices, and with themselves the best
performances. He mentions Egypt and Ethiopia, two countries out of which
subjects and suppliants were least to be expected ([Psa
68:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#031).md): Princes shall come out of
Egypt as ambassadors to seek God's favour and submit to him; and they
shall be accepted, for the Lord of hosts shall thereupon bless them,
saying, Blessed by Egypt my people, [Isa
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#025.md). Even Ethiopia, that had
stretched out her hands against God's Israel ([Ch2
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#009).md), should now stretch out her
hands unto God, in prayer, in presents, and to take hold on him, and
that soon. Agree with thy adversary quickly. Out of all nations some
shall be gathered in to Christ and be owned by him.

[Psalms 68:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">psa 68:32</span></span>

The psalmist, having prayed for and prophesied of the conversion of the
Gentiles, here invites them to come in and join with the devout
Israelites in praising God, intimating that their accession to the
church would be the matter of their joy and praise ([Psa
68:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#032).md): Let the kingdoms of the earth
sing praises to the Lord; they all ought to do it, and, when they become
the kingdoms of the Lord and of his Christ, they will do it. God is here
proposed to them as the proper object of praise upon several accounts:

I. Because of his supreme and sovereign dominion: He rides upon the
heavens of heavens which were of old ([Psa
68:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#033).md); compare [Psa
68:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#004.md). He has from the beginning, nay
from before all time, prepared his throne; he sits on the circuit of
heaven, guides all the motions of the heavenly bodies; and from the
highest heavens, which are the residence of his glory, he dispenses the
influences of his power and goodness to this lower world.

II\. Because of his awful and terrible majesty: He sends out his voice,
and that a mighty voice. This may refer either generally to the thunder,
which is called the voice of the Lord and is said to be powerful and
full of majesty ([Psa 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003.md), [Psa
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#004).md), or in particular to that
thunder in which God spoke to Israel at Mount Sinai.

III\. Because of his mighty power: Ascribe you strength unto God ([Psa
68:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#034).md); acknowledge him to be a God of
such irresistible power that it is folly to contend with him and wisdom
to submit to him; acknowledge that he has power sufficient both to
protect his faithful subjects and to destroy his stubborn adversaries;
and give him the glory of all the instances of his omnipotence. Thine is
the kingdom and power, and therefore thine is the glory. We must
acknowledge his power, 1. In the kingdom of grace: His excellency is
over Israel; he shows his sovereign care in protecting and governing his
church; that is the excellency of his power, which is employed for the
good of his people. 2. In the kingdom of providence: His strength is in
the clouds, whence comes the thunder of his power, the small rain, and
the great rain of his strength. Though God has his strength in the
clouds, yet he condescends to gather his Israel under the shadow of his
wings, [Deu 33:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#026.md).

IV\. Because of the glory of his sanctuary and the wonders wrought there
([Psa 68:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#035).md): O God! thou art terrible
out of thy holy places. God is to be admired and adored with reverence
and godly fear by all those that attend him in his holy places, that
receive his oracles, that observe his operations according to them, and
that pay their homage to him. He displays that out of his holy places
which declares aloud that he will be sanctified in those that come nigh
unto him. Out of heaven, his holy place above, he does, and will, show
himself a terrible God. Nor is any attribute of God more dreadful to
sinners than his holiness.

V. Because of the grace bestowed upon his people: The God of Israel is
he that gives strength and power unto his people, which the gods of the
nations, that were vanity and a lie, could not give to their
worshippers; how should they help them, when they could not help
themselves? All Israel's strength against their enemies came from God;
they owned they had no might of their own, [Ch2
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#012.md). And all our sufficiency for our
spiritual work and warfare is from the grace of God. It is through
Christ strengthening us that we can do all things, and not otherwise;
and therefore he must have the glory of all we do ([Psa
115:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#001).md) and our humble thanks for
enabling us to do it and accepting the work of his own hands in us. If
it be the God of Israel that vies strength and power unto his people,
they ought to say, Blessed be God. If all be from him, let all be to
him.
