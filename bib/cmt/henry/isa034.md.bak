### [Isaiah Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 34:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have the fatal doom of all the nations that are
enemies to God's church and people, though Edom only is mentioned,
because of the old enmity of Esau to Jacob, which was typical, as much
as that more ancient enmity of Cain to Abel, and flowed from the
original enmity of the serpent to the seed of the woman. It is probable
that this prophecy had its accomplishment in the great desolations made
by the Assyrian army first, or rather by Nebuchadnezzar's army some time
after, among those nations that were neighbours to Israel and had been
in some way or other injurious to them. That mighty conqueror took a
pride in shedding blood, and laying countries waste, and therein, quite
beyond his design, he was fulfilling what God here threatened against
his and his people's enemies. But we have reason to think it is intended
as a denunciation of the wrath of God against all those who fight
against the interests of his kingdom among men, that it has its frequent
accomplishment in the havoc made by the wars of the nations and other
desolating judgments, and will have its full accomplishment in the final
dissolution of all things at the day of judgment and perdition of
ungodly men. Here is, I. A demand of universal attention ([Isa
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#001).md). II. A direful scene of blood
and confusion presented ([Isa 34:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#002).md).
III. The reason given for these judgments ([Isa
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#008).md). IV. The continuance of this
desolation, the country being made like the lake of Sodom ([Isa
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#009.md), [Isa
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#010).md), and the cities abandoned to
wild beasts and melancholy fowls ([Isa
34:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011).md). V. The solemn ratification
of all this ([Isa 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#016.md), [Isa
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#017).md). Let us hear, and fear.

[Isaiah 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 34:1</span></span>

Here we have a prophecy, as elsewhere we have a history, of the wars of
the Lord, which we are sure are all both righteous and successful. This
world, as it is his creature, he does good to; but as it is in the
interest of Satan, who is called the god of this world, he fights
against it.

I. Here is the trumpet sounded and the war proclaimed, [Isa
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#001.md). All nations must hear and
hearken, not only because what God is about to do is well worthy their
remark (as [Isa 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#013).md), but because
they are all concerned in it; it is with them that God has a quarrel; it
is against them that God is coming forth in wrath. Let them all take
notice that the great God is angry with them; his indignation is upon
all nations, and therefore let all nations come near to hear. The
trumpet is blown in the city ([Amo
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#006).md), and the watchmen on the walls
cry, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet, [Jer
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#017.md). Let the earth hear, and the
fulness thereof, for it is the Lord's ([Psa
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001).md) and ought to hearken to its
Maker and Master. The world must hear, and all things that come forth of
it, the children of men, that are of the earth earthy, come out of it,
and must return to it; or the inanimate products of the earth are called
to, as more likely to hearken than sinners, whose hearts are hardened
against the calls of God. Hear, O you mountains! the Lord's controversy,
[Mic 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#002.md). It is so just a controversy
that all the world may be safely appealed to concerning the equity of
it.

II\. Here is the manifesto published, setting forth,

1\. Whom he makes war against ([Isa
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#002).md): The indignation of the Lord is
upon all nations; they are all in confederacy against God and religion,
all in the interests of the devil, and therefore he is angry with them
all, even with all the nations that forget him. He has long suffered all
nations to walk in their own ways ([Act
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#016).md), but now he will no longer keep
silence. As they have all had the benefit of his patience, so they must
all expect now to feel his resentments. His fury is in a special manner
upon all their armies, (1.) Because with them they have done mischief to
the people of God; those are they that have made bloody work with them,
and therefore they must be sure to have blood given them to drink. (2.)
Because with them they hope to make their part good against the justice
and power of God they trust to them as their defence, and therefore on
them, in the first place, God's fury will come. Armies before God's fury
are but as dry stubble before a consuming fire, though ever so numerous
and courageous.

2\. Whom he makes war for, and what are the grounds and reasons of the
war ([Isa 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#008).md): It is the day of the
Lord's vengeance, and he it is to whom vengeance belongs, and who is
never unrighteous in taking vengeance, [Rom
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005.md). As there is a day of the Lord's
patience, so there will be a day of his vengeance; for, though he bear
long, he will not bear always. It is the year of recompences for the
controversy of Zion. Zion is the holy city, the city of our solemnities,
a type and figure of the church of God in the world. Zion has a just
quarrel with her neighbours for the wrongs they have done her, for all
their treacherous and barbarous usage of her, profaning her holy things,
laying waste her palaces, and slaying her sons. She has left it to God
to plead her cause, and he will do so when the time, even the set time,
to favour Zion shall have come; then he will recompense to her
persecutors and oppressors all the mischiefs they have done her. The
controversy will be decided, that Zion has been wronged, and therein
Zion's God has been himself abused. Judgment will be given upon this
decision, and execution done. Note, There is a time prefixed in the
divine counsels for the deliverance of the church and the destruction of
her enemies, a year of the redeemed, which will come, a year of
recompences for the controversy of Zion; and we must patiently wait till
then, and judge nothing before the time.

III\. Here are the operations of the war, and the methods of it,
settled, with an infallible assurance of success. 1. The sword of the
Lord is bathed in heaven; this is all the preparation here made for the
war, [Isa 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005.md). It may probably allude
to some custom they had then of bathing their swords in some liquor or
other, to harden them or brighten them; it is the same with the
furbishing of it, that it may glitter, [Eze
21:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#009.md). God's sword is bathed in
heaven, in his counsel and decree, in his justice and power, and then
there is not standing before it. 2. It shall come down. What he has
determined shall without fail be put in execution. It shall come down
from heaven, and the higher the place is, whence it comes, the heavier
will it fall. It will come down upon Idumea, the people of God's curse,
the people that lie under his curse and are by it doomed to destruction.
Miserable, for ever miserable, are those that have by their sins made
themselves the people of God's curse; for the sword of the Lord will
infallibly attend the curse of the Lord and execute the sentences of it;
and those whom he curses are cursed indeed. It shall come down to
judgment, to execute judgment upon sinners. Note, God's sword of war is
always a sword of justice. It is observed of him out of whose mouth
goeth the sharp sword that in righteousness he doth judge and make war,
[Rev 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011.md), [Rev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015.md). 3. The nations and their armies
shall be given up to the sword ([Isa
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#002).md): God has delivered them to the
slaughter, and then they cannot deliver themselves, nor can all the
friends they have deliver them from it. Those only are slain whom God
delivers to the slaughter, for the keys of death are in his hand; and,
in delivering them to the slaughter, he has utterly destroyed them;
their destruction is as sure, when God has doomed them to it, as if they
were destroyed already, utterly destroyed. God has, in effect, delivered
all the cruel enemies of his church to the slaughter by that word ([Rev
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#010).md), He that kills with the sword
must be killed by the sword, for the Lord is righteous. 4. Pursuant to
the sentence, a terrible slaughter shall be made among them ([Isa
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006).md): The sword of the Lord, when it
comes down with commission, does vast execution; it is filled, satiated,
surfeited, with blood, the blood of the slain, and made fat with their
fatness. When the day of God's abused mercy and patience is over the
sword of his justice gives no quarter, spares none. Men have by sin lost
the honour of the human nature and made themselves like the beasts that
perish; they are therefore justly denied the compassion and respect that
are owing to the human nature and killed as beasts, and no more is made
of slaying an army of men than of butchering a flock of lambs or goats
and feeding on the fat of the kidneys of rams. Nay, the sword of the
Lord shall not only dispatch the lambs and goats, the infantry of their
armies, the poor common soldiers, but ([Isa
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#007).md) the unicorns too shall be made
to come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls, though they are
ever so proud, and strong, and fierce (the great men, and the mighty
men, and the chief captains [Rev
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#015).md), the sword of the Lord will make
as easy a prey of as of the lambs and the goats. The greatest of men are
nothing before the wrath of the great God. See what bloody work will be
made: The land shall be soaked with blood, as with the rain that comes
often upon it and in great abundance; and their dust, their dry and
barren land, shall be made fat with the fatness of men slain in their
full strength, as with manure. Nay even the mountains, which are hard
and rocky, shall be melted with their blood, [Isa
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#003.md). These expressions are
hyperbolical (as St. John's vision of blood to the horse-bridles, [Rev
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#020).md), and are made use of because
they sound very dreadful to sense (it makes us even shiver to think of
such abundance of human gore), and are therefore proper to express the
terror of God's wrath, which is dreadful beyond conception and
expression. See what work sin and wrath make even in this world, and
think how much more terrible the wrath to come is, which will bring down
the unicorns themselves to the bars of the pit. 5. This great slaughter
will be a great sacrifice to the justice of God ([Isa
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006).md): The Lord has a sacrifice in
Bozrah; there it is that the great Redeemer has his garments dyed with
blood, [Isa 63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md). Sacrifices were
intended for the honour of God, to make it appear that he hates sin and
demands satisfaction for it, and that nothing but blood will make
atonement; and for these ends the slaughter is made, that in it the
wrath of God may be revealed from heaven against all the ungodliness and
unrighteousness of men, especially their ungodly unrighteous enmity to
his people, which was the sin that the Edomites were notoriously guilty
of. In great sacrifices abundance of beasts were killed, hecatombs
offered, and their blood poured out before the altar; and so will it be
in this day of the Lord's vengeance. And thus would the whole earth have
been soaked with the blood of sinners if Jesus Christ, the great
propitiation, had not shed his blood for us; but those who reject him,
and will not make a covenant with God by that sacrifice, will themselves
fall as victims to divine wrath. Damned sinners are everlasting
sacrifices, [Mar 9:48](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#048.md), [Mar
9:49](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#049.md). Those that sacrifice not (which
is the character of the ungodly, [Ecc
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#002).md) must be sacrificed. 6. These
slain shall be detestable to mankind, and shall be as much their
loathing as ever they were their terror ([Isa
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#003).md): They shall be cast out, and
none shall pay them the respect of a decent burial; but their stink
shall come up out of their carcases, that all people by the odious
smell, as well as by the ghastly sight, may be made to conceive an
indignation against sin and a dread of the wrath of God. They lie
unburied, that they may remain monuments of divine justice. 7. The
effect and consequence of this slaughter shall be universal confusion
and desolation, as if the whole frame of nature were dissolved and
melted down ([Isa 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#004).md): All the host
of heaven shall pine and waste away (so the word is); the sun shall be
darkened, and the moon look black, or be turned into blood; the heavens
themselves shall be rolled together as a scroll or parchment when we
have done with it, and lay it by, or as when it is shrivelled up by the
heat of the fire. The stars shall fall as the leaves in autumn; all the
beauty, joy, and comfort, of the vanquished nation shall be lost and
done away, magistracy and government shall be abolished, and all
dominion and rule, but that of the sword of war, shall fall. Conquerors,
in those times, affected to lay waste the countries they conquered; and
such a complete desolation is here described by such figurative
expressions as will yet have a literal and full accomplishment in the
dissolution of all things at the end of time, of which last day of
judgment the judgments which God does now sometimes remarkably execute
on sinful nations are figures, earnests, and forerunners; and by these
we should be awakened to think of that, for which reason these
expressions are used here and [Rev
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#012.md), [Rev
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#013.md). But they are used without a
metaphor, [Pe2 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010.md), where we are told
that the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the earth shall
be burnt up.

[Isaiah 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 34:9</span></span>

This prophecy looks very black, but surely it looks so further than upon
Edom and Bozrah. 1. It describes the melancholy changes that are often
made by the divine Providence, in countries, cities, palaces, and
families. Places that have flourished and been much frequented strangely
go to decay. We know not where to find the places where many great
towns, celebrated in history, once stood. Fruitful countries, in process
of time, are turned into barrenness, and pompous populous cities into
ruinous heaps. Old decayed castles look frightful, and their ruins are
almost as much dreaded as ever their garrisons were. 2. It describes the
destroying judgments which are the effects of God's wrath and the just
punishment of those that are enemies to his people, which God will
inflict when the year of the redeemed has come, and the year of
recompences for the controversy of Zion. Those that aim to ruin the
church can never do that, but will infallibly ruin themselves. 3. It
describes the final desolation of this wicked world, which is reserved
unto fire at the day of judgment, [Pe2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#007.md). The earth itself, when it, and
all the works that are therein, shall be burnt up, will (for aught I
know) be turned into a hell to all those that set their affections on
earthly things. However, this prophecy shows us what will be the lot of
the generation of God's curse.

I. The country shall become like the lake of Sodom, [Isa
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#009.md), [Isa
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#010.md). The streams thereof, that both
watered the land and pleased and refreshed the inhabitants, shall now be
turned into pitch, shall be congealed, shall look black, and shall move
slowly, or not at all. Their floods to lazy streams of pitch shall turn;
so Sir R. Blackmore. The dust thereof shall be turned into brimstone; so
combustible has sin made their land that it shall take fire at the first
spark of God's wrath struck upon it; and, when it has taken fire, it
shall become burning pitch; the fire shall be universal, not a house, or
town, on fire, but a whole country; and it shall not be in the power of
any to suppress or extinguish it. It shall burn continually, burn
perpetually, and shall not be quenched night nor day. The torment of
those in hell, or that have a hell within them in their own consciences,
is without interruption; the smoke of this fire goes up for ever. As
long as there are provoking sinners on earth, from one generation to
another, an increase of sinful men, to augment the fierce anger of the
Lord ([Num 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#014).md), there will be a
righteous God in heaven to punish them for it. And as long as a people
keep up a succession of sinners God will have a succession of plagues
for them; nor will any that fall under the wrath of God be ever able to
recover themselves. It will be found, how light soever men make of it,
that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. If
the land be doomed to destruction, none shall pass through it, but
travellers will choose rather to go a great way about than come within
the smell of it.

II\. The cities shall become like old decayed houses, which, being
deserted by the owners, look very frightful, being commonly possessed by
beasts of prey or birds of ill omen. See how dismally the palaces of the
enemy look; the description is peculiarly elegant and fine. 1. God shall
mark them for ruin and destruction. He shall stretch out upon Bozrah the
line of confusion with the stones or plummets of emptiness, [Isa
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011.md). This intimates the equity of
the sentence passed upon it; it is given according to the rules of
justice and the exact agreeableness of the execution with the sentence;
the destruction is not wrought at random, but by line and level. The
confusion and emptiness that shall overspread the face of the whole
country shall be like that of the whole earth when it was Tohu and Bohu
(the very words here used) - without form and void. [Gen
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002.md). Sin will soon turn a paradise
into a chaos, and sully the beauty of the whole creation. When there is
confusion there will soon be emptiness; but both are appointed by the
governor of the world, and in exact proportions. 2. Their great men
shall be all cut off, and none of them shall dare to appear ([Isa
34:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#012).md): They shall call the nobles of
the kingdom to take care of the arduous affairs which lie before them,
but none shall be there to take this ruin under their hand, and all her
princes, having the sad tidings brought them, shall be nothing, shall be
at their wits' end, and not be able to stand them in stead, to shelter
them from destruction.

III\. Even the houses of state, and those of strength, shall become as
wildernesses ([Isa 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#013).md); not only
grass shall grow, but thorns shall come up, in her palaces, nettles and
brambles in the fortresses thereof, and there shall be none to cut them
up or tread them down. We sometimes see ruined buildings thus overgrown
with rubbish. It intimates that the place shall not only be uninhabited
and unfrequented where a full court used to be kept, but that it shall
be under the curse of God; for thorns and thistles were the production
of the curse, [Gen 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#018.md).

IV\. They shall become the residence and rendezvous of fearful frightful
beasts and birds, which usually frequent such melancholy places, because
there they may be undisturbed, and, when they are frightened thither,
they help to frighten men thence. This circumstance of the desolation,
being apt to strike a horror upon the mind, is much enlarged upon here,
[Isa 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011.md). The cormorant shall
possess it, or the pelican, which affects to be solitary ([Psa
102:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#006).md); and the bittern, which makes a
hideous noise, the owl, a melancholy bird, the raven, a bird of prey,
invited by the dead carcases, shall dwell there (with all the ill-boding
monsters of the air, Sir R. B.), all the unclean birds, which were not
for the service of man, [Isa 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#013.md). It
shall be a habitation for dragons, which are poisonous and hurtful.

And in their lofty rooms of state,

Where cringing sycophants did wait,

Dragons shall hiss and hungry wolves shall howl;

In courts before by mighty lords possess'd

The serpent shall erect his speckled crest,

Or fold his circling spires to rest.

\- Sir R. Blackmore

That which was a court for princes shall now be a court for owls or
ostriches, [Isa 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#014.md). The wild beasts
of the desert, the dry and sandy country, shall meet, as it were by
appointment, with the wild beasts of the island, the wet marshy country,
and shall regale themselves with such a perfect desolation as they shall
find there.

Leopards, and all the rav'ning brotherhoods

That range the plains, or lurk in woods,

Each other shall invite to come,

And make this wilder place their home.

Fierce beasts of every frightful shape and size

Shall settle here their bloody colonies.

\- Sir R. Blackmore

The satyr shall cry to his fellow to go with him to this desert place,
or, being there, they shall please themselves that they have found such
an agreeable habitation. There shall the screech-owl rest, a night-bird
and an ominous one. The great owl shall there make her nest ([Isa
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#015).md) and lay and hatch; the breed of
them shall be kept up to provide heirs for this desolate place. The
vultures which feast on carcases, shall be gathered there, every one
with his mate. Now observe, 1. How the places which men have deserted,
and keep at a distance from, are proper receptacles for other animals,
which the providence of God takes care of, and will not neglect. 2. Whom
those resemble that are morose, unsociable, and unconversable, and
affect a melancholy retirement; they are like these solitary creatures
that take delight in desolations. 3. What a dismal change sin makes; it
turns a fruitful land into barrenness, a frequented city into a
wilderness.

V. Here is an assurance given of the full accomplishment of this
prediction, even to the most minute circumstance of it ([Isa
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#016.md), [Isa
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#017).md): "Seek you out of the book of
the Lord and read. When this destruction comes compare the event with
the prediction, and you will find it to answer exactly." Note, The book
of the prophets is the book of the Lord, and we ought to consult it and
converse with it as of divine origin and authority. We must not only
read it, but see out of it, search into it, turn first to one text and
then to another and compare them together. Abundance of useful knowledge
might thus be extracted, by a diligent search, out of the scriptures,
which cannot be got by a superficial reading of them. When you have read
the prediction out of the book of the Lord then observe, 1. That
according to what you have read so you see; not one of these shall fail,
either beast or fowl: and, it being foretold that they shall possess it
from generation to generation, in order to that, that the species may be
propagated, none shall want her mate; these marks of desolation shall be
fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the land. 2. That God's mouth
having commanded this direful muster his Spirit shall gather them, as
the creatures by instinct were gathered to Adam to be named and to Noah
to be housed. What God's word has appointed his Spirit will effect and
bring about, for no word of God shall fall to the ground. The word of
God's promise shall in like manner be accomplished by the operations of
the Spirit. 3. That there is an exact order and proportion observed in
the accomplishment of this threatening: He has cast the lot for these
birds and beasts, so that each one shall know his place as readily as if
it were marked by line. See the like, [Joe
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#007.md), [Joe
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#008.md), They shall not break their ranks,
neither shall one thrust another. The soothsayers among the heathen
foretold events by the flight of birds, as if the fate of men depended
on them. But here we find that the flight of birds is under the
direction of the God of Israel: he has cast the lot for them. 4. That
the desolation shall be perpetual: They shall possess it for ever. God's
Jerusalem may be laid in ruins; but Jerusalem of old recovered itself
out of its ruins, till it gave place to the gospel Jerusalem, which may
be brought low, but shall be rebuilt, and shall continue till it give
place to the heavenly Jerusalem. But the enemies of the church shall be
for ever desolate, shall be punished with an everlasting destruction.
