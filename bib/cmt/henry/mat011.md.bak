### [Matthew Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#001.md)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 11:0</span></span>

In this chapter we have, I. The constant and unwearied diligence of our
Lord Jesus in his great work of preaching the gospel ([Mat
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#001).md). II. His discourse with the
disciples of John concerning his being the Messiah ([Mat
11:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#002).md). III. The honourable testimony
that Christ bore to John Baptist ([Mat
11:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#007).md). IV. The sad account he gives
of that generation in general, and of some particular places with
reference to the success, both of John's ministry and of his own (v.
16-24). V. His thanksgiving to his Father for the wise and gracious
method he had taken in revealing the great mysteries of the gospel (v.
25, 26). VI. His gracious call and invitation of poor sinners to come to
him, and to be ruled, and taught, and saved by him (v. 27-30). No Where
have we more of the terror of gospel woes for warning to us, or of the
sweetness of gospel grace for encouragement to us, than in this chapter,
which sets before us life and death, the blessing and the curse.

[Matthew 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 11:1</span></span>

The first verse of this chapter some join to the foregoing chapter, and
make it (not unfitly) the close of that.

1\. The ordination sermon which Christ preached to his disciples in the
foregoing chapter is here called his commanding them. Note, Christ's
commissions imply commands. Their preaching of the gospel was not only
permitted them, but it was enjoined them. It was not a thing respecting
which they were left at their liberty, but necessity was laid upon them,
[Co1 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#016.md). The promises he made them
are included in these commands, for the covenant of grace is a word
which he hath commanded, [Psa 105:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#008.md).
He made an end of commanding, etelesendiatassōn. Note, The instructions
Christ gives are full instructions. He goes through with his work.

2\. When Christ had said what he had to say to his disciples, he
departed thence. It should seem they were very loth to leave their
Master, till he departed and separated himself from them; as the nurse
withdraws the hand, that the child may learn to go by itself. Christ
would now teach them how to live, and how to work, without his bodily
presence. It was expedient for them, that Christ should thus go away for
awhile, that they might be prepared for his long departure, and that, by
the help of the Spirit, their own hands might be sufficient for them
([Deu 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#007).md), and they might not be
always children. We have little account of what they did now pursuant to
their commission. They went abroad, no doubt; probably into Judea (for
in Galilee the gospel had been mostly preached hitherto), publishing the
doctrine of Christ, and working miracles in his name: but still in a
more immediate dependence upon him, and not being long from him; and
thus they were trained up, by degrees, for their great work.

3\. Christ departed, to teach and preach in the cities whither he sent
his disciples before him to work miracles ([Mat
10:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001).md), and so to raise people's
expectations, and to make way for his entertainment. Thus was the way of
the Lord prepared; John prepared it by bringing people to repentance,
but he did no miracles. The disciples go further, they work miracles for
confirmation. Note, Repentance and faith prepare people for the
blessings of the kingdom of heaven, which Christ gives. Observe, When
Christ empowered them to work miracles, he employed himself in teaching
and preaching, as if that were the more honourable of the two. That was
but in order to do this. Healing the sick was the saving of bodies, but
preaching the gospel was to the saving of souls. Christ had directed his
disciples to preach ([Mat 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#007).md), yet
he did not leave off preaching himself. He set them to work, not for his
own ease, but for the ease of the country, and was not the less busy for
employing them. How unlike are they to Christ, who yoke others only that
they may themselves be idle! Note, the increase and multitude of
labourers in the Lord's work should be made not an excuse for our
negligence, but an encouragement to our diligence. The more busy others
are, the more busy we should be, and all little enough, so much work is
there to be done. Observe, he went to preach in their cities, which were
populous places; he cast the net of the gospel where there were most
fish to be enclosed. Wisdom cries in the cities ([Pro
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#021).md), at the entry of the city ([Pro
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#003).md), in the cities of the Jews, even
of them who made light of him, who notwithstanding had the first offer.

What he preached we are not told, but it was probably to the same
purpose with his sermon on the mount. But here is next recorded a
message which John Baptist sent to Christ, and his return to it, [Mat
11:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#002.md). We heard before that Jesus
heard of John's sufferings, [Mat 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#012.md).
Now we are told that John, in prison, hears of Christ's doings. He heard
in the prison the works of Christ; and no doubt he was glad to hear of
them, for he was a true friend of the Bridegroom, [Joh
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#029.md). Note, When one useful instrument
is laid aside, God knows how to raise up many others in the stead of it.
The work went on, though John was in prison, and it added no affliction,
but a great deal of consolation, to his bonds. Nothing more comfortable
to God's people in distress, than to hear of the works of Christ;
especially to experience them in their own souls. This turns a prison
into a palace. Some way or other Christ will convey the notices of his
love to those that are in trouble for conscience sake. John could not
see the works of Christ, but he heard of them with pleasure. And blessed
are they who have not seen, but only heard, and yet have believed.

Now John Baptist, hearing of Christ's works, sent two of his disciples
to him; and what passed between them and him we have here an account of.
Here is,

I. The question they had to propose to him: Art thou he that should
come, or do we look for another? This was a serious and important
question; Art thou the Messiah promised, or not? Art thou the Christ?
Tell us. 1. It is taken for granted that the Messiah should come. It was
one of the names by which he was known to the Old Testament saints, he
that cometh or shall come, [Psa
118:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#026.md). He is now come, but there is
another coming of his which we still expect. 2. They intimate, that if
this be not he, they would look for another. Note, We must not be weary
of looking for him that is to come, nor ever say, we will not more
expect him till we come to enjoy him. Though he tarry, wait for him, for
he that shall come will come, though not in our time. 3. They intimate
likewise, that if they be convinced that this is he, they will not be
sceptics, they will be satisfied, and will look for no other. 4. They
therefore ask, Art thou he? John had said for his part, I am not the
Christ, [Joh 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#020). Now, (1..md) Some
think that John sent this question for his own satisfaction. It is true
he had borne a noble testimony to Christ; he had declared him to be the
Son of God ([Joh 1:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#034).md), the Lamb of
God ([Joh 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029).md), and he that should
baptize with the Holy Ghost ([Joh
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#033).md), and sent of God ([Joh
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034).md), which were great things. But he
desired to be further and more fully assured, that he was the Messiah
that had been so long promised and expected. Note, In matters relating
to Christ and our salvation by him, it is good to be sure. Christ
appeared not in that external pomp and power in which it was expected he
should appear; his own disciples stumbled at this, and perhaps John did
so; Christ saw something of this at the bottom of this enquiry, when he
said, blessed is he who shall not be offended in me. Note, It is hard,
even for good men, to bear up against vulgar errors. (2.) John's doubt
might arise from his own present circumstances. He was a prisoner, and
might be tempted to think, if Jesus be indeed the Messiah, whence is it
that I, his friend and forerunner, am brought into this trouble, and am
left to be so long in it, and he never looks after me, never visits me,
nor sends to me, enquires not after me, does nothing either to sweeten
my imprisonment or hasten my enlargement? Doubtless there was a good
reason why our Lord Jesus did not go to John in prison, lest there
should seem to have been a compact between them: but John construed it
into a neglect, and it was perhaps a shock to his faith in Christ. Note,
\[1.\] Where there is true faith, yet there may be a mixture of
unbelief. The best are not always alike strong. \[2.\] Troubles for
Christ, especially when they continue long unrelieved, are such trials
of faith as sometimes prove too hard to be borne up against. \[3.\] The
remaining unbelief of good men may sometimes, in an hour of temptation,
strike at the root, and call in question the most fundamental truths
which were thought to be well settled. Will the Lord cast off for ever?
But we will hope that John's faith did not fail in this matter, only he
desired to have it strengthened and confirmed. Note, The best saints
have need of the best helps they can get for the strengthening of their
faith, and the arming of themselves against temptations to infidelity.
Abraham believed, and yet desired a sign ([Gen
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006.md), [Gen
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#008).md), so did Gideon, [Jdg
6:36](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#036). But, (3..md) Others think that John
sent his disciples to Christ with this question, not so much for his own
satisfaction as for theirs. Observe, Though he was a prisoner they
adhered to him, attended on him, and were ready to receive instructions
from him; they loved him, and would not leave him. Now, \[1.\] They were
weak in knowledge, and wavering in their faith, and needed instruction
and confirmation; and in this matter they were somewhat prejudiced;
being jealous for their master, they were jealous of our Master; they
were loth to acknowledge Jesus to be the Messiah, because he eclipsed
John, and are loth to believe their own master when they think he speaks
against himself and them. Good men are apt to have their judgments
blessed by their interest. Now John would have their mistakes rectified,
and wished them to be as well satisfied as he himself was. Note, The
strong ought to consider the infirmities of the weak, and to do what
they can to help them: and such as we cannot help ourselves we should
send to those that can. When thou art converted, strengthen thy
brethren. \[2.\] John was all along industrious to turn over his
disciples to Christ, as from the grammar-school to the academy. Perhaps
he foresaw his death approaching, and therefore would bring his
disciples to be better acquainted with Christ, under whose guardianship
he must leave them. Note, Ministers' business is to direct every body to
Christ. And those who would know the certainty of the doctrine of
Christ, must apply themselves to him, who is come to give an
understanding. They who would grow in grace must be inquisitive.

II\. Here is Christ's answer to this question, [Mat
11:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#004.md). It was not so direct and
express, as when he said, I that speak unto thee am he; but it was a
real answer, an answer in fact. Christ will have us to spell out the
convincing evidences of gospel truths, and to take pains in digging for
knowledge.

1\. He points them to what they heard and saw, which they must tell
John, that he might from thence take occasion the more fully to instruct
and convince them out of their own mouths. Go and tell him what you hear
and see. Note, Our senses may and ought to be appealed to in those
things that are their proper objects. Therefore the popish doctrine of
the real presence agrees not with the truth as it is in Jesus; for
Christ refers us to the things we hear and see. Go and tell John,

(1.) What you see of the power of Christ's miracles; you see how, by the
word of Jesus, the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, etc.
Christ's miracles were done openly, and in the view of all; for they
feared not the strongest and most impartial scrutiny. Veritas no quaerit
angulos - Truth seeks not concealment. They are to be considered, \[1.\]
As the acts of a divine power. None but the God of nature could thus
overrule and outdo the power of nature. It is particularly spoken of as
God's prerogative to open the eyes of the blind, [Psa
146:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#008.md). Miracles are therefore the
broad seal of heaven, and the doctrine they are affixed to must be of
God, for his power will never contradict his truth; nor can it be
imagined that he should set his seal to a lie; however lying wonders may
be vouched for in proof of false doctrines, true miracles evince a
divine commission; such Christ's were, and they leave no room to doubt
that he was sent of God, and that his doctrine was his that sent him.
\[2.\] As the accomplishment of a divine prediction. It was foretold
([Isa 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#005.md), [Isa
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006).md), that our God should come, and
that then the eyes of the blind should be opened. Now if the works of
Christ agree with the words of the prophet, as it is plain they do, then
no doubt but this is our God whom we have waited for, who shall come
with a recompence; this is he who is so much wanted.

(2.) Tell him what you hear of the preaching of his gospel, which
accompanies his miracles. Faith, though confirmed by seeing, comes by
hearing. Tell him, \[1.\] That the poor preach the gospel; so some read
it. It proves Christ's divine mission, that those whom he employed in
founding his kingdom were poor men, destitute of all secular advantages,
who, therefore, could never have carried their point, if they had not
been carried on by a divine power. \[2.\] That the poor have the gospel
preached to them. Christ's auditory is made up of such as the scribes
and Pharisees despised, and looked upon with contempt, and the rabbies
would not instruct, because they were notable to pay them. The Old
Testament prophets were sent mostly to kings and princes, but Christ
preached to the congregations of the poor. It was foretold that the poor
of the flock should wait upon him, [Zac
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#011.md). Note, Christ's gracious
condescensions and compassions to the poor, are an evidence that it was
he that should bring to the world the tender mercies of our God. It was
foretold that the Son of David should be the poor man's King, [Psa
72:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#002.md), [Psa
72:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#004.md), [Psa
72:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#012.md), [Psa
72:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#013.md). Or we may understand it, not so
much of the poor of the world, as the poor in spirit, and so that
scripture is fulfilled, [Isa 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md), He
hath anointed me to preach glad tidings to the meek. Note, It is a proof
of Christ's divine mission that his doctrine is gospel indeed; good news
to those who are truly humbled in sorrow for their sins, and truly
humble in the denial of self; to them it is accommodated, for whom God
always declared he had mercy in store. \[3.\] That the poor receive the
gospel, and are wrought upon by it, they are evangelized, they receive
and entertain the gospel, are leavened by it, and delivered into it as
into a mould. Note, The wonderful efficacy of the gospel is a proof of
its divine original. The poor are wrought upon by it. The prophets
complained of the poor, that they knew not the way of the Lord, [Jer
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#004.md). They could do no good upon them;
but the gospel of Christ made its way into their untutored minds.

2\. He pronounces a blessing on those that were not offended in him,
[Mat 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#006.md). So clear are these
evidences of Christ's mission, that they who are not wilfully prejudiced
against him, and scandalized in him (so the word is), cannot but receive
his doctrine, and so be blessed in him. Note, (1.) There are many things
in Christ which they who are ignorant and unthinking are apt to be
offended at, some circumstances for the sake of which they reject the
substance of his gospel. The meanness of his appearance, his education
at Nazareth, the poverty of his life, the despicableness of his
followers, the slights which the great men put upon him, the strictness
of his doctrine, the contradiction it gives to flesh and blood, and the
sufferings that attend the profession of his name; these are things that
keep many from him, who otherwise cannot but see much of God in him.
Thus he is set for the fall of many, even in Israel ([Luk
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#034).md), a Rock of offence, [Pe1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#008). (2..md) They are happy who get over
these offences. Blessed are they. The expression intimates, that it is a
difficult thing to conquer these prejudices, and a dangerous thing not
to conquer them; but as to those, who, notwithstanding this opposition,
to believe in Christ, their faith will be found so much the more, to
praise, and honour, and glory.

[Matthew 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 11:7</span></span>

We have here the high encomium which our Lord Jesus gave of John the
Baptist; not only to revive his honour, but to revive his work. Some of
Christ's disciples might perhaps take occasion from the question John
sent, to reflect upon him, as weak and wavering, and inconsistent with
himself, to prevent which Christ gives him this character. Note, It is
our duty to consult the reputation of our brethren, and not only to
remove, but to obviate and prevent, jealousies and ill thoughts of them;
and we must take all occasions, especially such as discover any thing of
infirmity, to speak well of those who are praiseworthy, and to give them
that fruit of their hands. John the Baptist, when he was upon the stage,
and Christ in privacy and retirement, bore testimony to Christ; and now
that Christ appeared publicly, and John was under a cloud, he bore
testimony to John. Note, They who have a confirmed interest themselves,
should improve it for the helping of the credit and reputation of
others, whose character claims it, but whose temper or present
circumstances put them out of the way of it. This is giving honour to
whom honour is due. John had abased himself to honour Christ ([Joh
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020.md), [Joh
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#030.md), [Mat
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011).md), had made himself nothing, that
Christ might be All, and now Christ dignifies him with this character.
Note, They who humble themselves shall be exalted, and those that honour
Christ he will honour; those that confess him before men, he will
confess, and sometimes before men too, even in this world. John had now
finished his testimony, and now Christ commends him. Note, Christ
reserves honour for his servants when they have done their work, [Joh
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#026.md).

Now concerning this commendation of John, observe,

I. That Christ spoke thus honourably of John, not in the hearing of
John's disciples, but as they departed, just after they were gone, [Luk
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#024.md). He would not so much as seem to
flatter John, nor have these praises of him reported to him. Note,
Though we must be forward to give to all their due praise for their
encouragement, yet we must avoid every thing that looks like flattery,
or may be in danger of puffing them up. They who in other things are
mortified to the world, yet cannot well bear their own praise. Pride is
a corrupt humour, which we must not feed either in others or in
ourselves.

II\. That what Christ said concerning John, was intended not only for
his praise, but for the people's profit, to revive the remembrance of
John's ministry, which had been well attended, but which was now (as
other such things used to be) strangely forgotten: they did for a
season, and but for a season, rejoice in his light, [Joh
5:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#035.md). "Now, consider, what went ye out
into the wilderness to see? Put this question to yourselves." 1. John
preached in the wilderness, and thither people flocked in crowds to him,
though in a remote place, and an inconvenient one. If teachers be
removed into corners, it is better to go after them than to be without
them. Now if his preaching was worth taking so much pains to hear it,
surely it was worth taking some care to recollect it. The greater the
difficulties we have broken through to hear the word, the more we are
concerned to profit by it. 2. They went out to him to see him; rather to
feed their eyes with the unusual appearance of his person, than to feed
their souls with his wholesome instructions; rather for curiosity than
for conscience. Note, Many that attend on the word come rather to see
and be seen, than to learn and be taught, to have something to talk of,
than to be made wise to salvation. Christ puts it to them, what went ye
out to see? Note, They who attend on the word will be called to an
account, what their intentions and what their improvements were. We
think when the sermon is done, the care is over; no, then the greatest
of the care begins. It will shortly be asked, "What business had you
such a time at such an ordinance? What brought you thither? Was it
custom or company, or was it a desire to honour God and get good? What
have you brought thence? What knowledge, and grace, and comfort? What
went you to see?" Note, When we go to read and hear the word, we should
see that we aim right in what we do.

III\. Let us see what the commendation of John was. They know not what
answer to make to Christ's question; well, says Christ, "I will tell you
what a man John the Baptist was."

1\. "He was a firm, resolute man, and not a reed shaken with the wind;
you have been so in your thoughts of him, but he was not so. He was not
wavering in his principles, nor uneven in his conversation; but was
remarkable for his steadiness and constant consistency with himself."
They who are weak as reeds will be shaken as reeds; but John was strong
in spirit, [Eph 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014.md). When the wind of
popular applause on the one hand blew fresh and fair, when the storm of
Herod's rage on the other hand grew fierce and blustering, John was
still the same, the same in all weathers. The testimony he had borne to
Christ was not the testimony of a reed, of a man who was of one mind
today, and of another tomorrow; it was not a weather-cock testimony; no,
his constancy in it is intimated ([Joh
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#020).md); he confessed and denied not,
but confessed, and stood to it afterwards, [Joh
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#028.md). And therefore this question sent
by his disciples was not to be construed into any suspicion of the truth
of what he had formerly said: therefore the people flocked to him,
because he was not as a reed. Note, There is nothing lost in the long
run by an unshaken resolution to go on with our work, neither courting
the smiles, nor fearing the frowns of men.

2\. He was a self-denying man, and mortified to this world. "Was he a
man clothed in soft raiment? If so, you would not have gone into the
wilderness to see him, but to the court. You went to see one that had
his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; his
mien and habit showed that he was dead to all the pomps of the world and
the pleasures of sense; his clothing agreed with the wilderness he lived
in, and the doctrine he preached there, that of repentance. Now you
cannot think that he who was such a stranger to the pleasures of a
court, should be brought to change his mind by the terrors of a prison,
and now to question whether Jesus be the Messiah or not!" Note, they who
have lived a life of mortification, are least likely to be driven off
from their religion by persecution. He was not a man clothed in soft
raiment; such there are, but they are in kings' houses. Note, It becomes
people in all their appearances to be consistent with their character
and their situation. They who are preachers must not affect to look like
courtiers; nor must they whose lot is cast in common dwellings, be
ambitious of the soft clothing which they wear who are in kings' houses.
Prudence teaches us to be of a piece. John appeared rough and
unpleasant, yet they flocked after him. Note, The remembrance of our
former zeal in attending on the word of God, should quicken us to, and
in, our present work: let it not be said that we have done and suffered
so many things in vain, have run in vain and laboured in vain.

3\. His greatest commendation of all was his office and ministry, which
was more his honour than any personal endowments or qualifications could
be; and therefore this is most enlarged upon in a full encomium.

(1.) He was a prophet, yea, and more than a prophet ([Mat
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#009).md); so he said of him who was the
great Prophet, to whom all the prophets bear witness. John said of
himself, he was not that prophet, that great prophet, the Messiah
himself; and now Christ (a very competent Judge) says of him, that he
was more than a prophet. He owned himself inferior to Christ, and Christ
owned him superior to all other prophets. Observe, The forerunner of
Christ was not a king, but a prophet, lest it should seem that the
kingdom of the Messiah had been laid in earthly power; but his immediate
forerunner was, as such, a transcendent prophet, more than an Old
Testament prophet; they all did virtuously, but John excelled them all;
they saw Christ's day at a distance, and their vision was yet for a
great while to come; but John saw the day dawn, he saw the sun rise, and
told the people of the Messiah, as one that stood among them. They spake
of Christ, but he pointed to him; they said, A virgin shall conceive: he
said, Behold the Lamb of God!

(2.) He was the same that was predicted to be Christ's forerunner ([Mat
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#010).md); This is he of whom it is
written. He was prophesied of by the other prophets, and therefore was
greater than they. Malachi prophesied concerning John, Behold, I send my
messenger before thy face. Herein some of Christ's honour was put upon
him, that the Old Testament prophets spake and wrote of him; and this
honour have all the saints, that their names are written in the Lamb's
book of life. It was great preferment to John above all the prophets,
that he was Christ's harbinger. He was a messenger sent on a great
errand; a messenger, one among a thousand, deriving his honour from his
whose messenger he was: he is my messenger sent of God. His business was
to prepare Christ's way, to dispose people to receive the Saviour, by
discovering to them their sin and misery, and their need of a Saviour.
This he had said of himself ([Joh
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#023).md) and now Christ said it of him;
intending hereby not only to put an honour upon John's ministry, but to
revive people's regard to it, as making way for the Messiah. Note, Much
of the beauty of God's dispensations lies in their mutual connection and
coherence, and the reference they have one to another. That which
advanced John above the Old Testament prophets was, that he went
immediately before Christ. Note, The nearer any are to Christ, the more
truly honourable they are.

(3.) There was not a greater born of women than John the Baptist, v. 11.
Christ knew how to value persons according to the degrees of their
worth, and he prefers John before all that went before him, before all
that were born of women by ordinary generation. Of all that God had
raised up and called to any service in his church, John is the most
eminent, even beyond Moses himself; for he began to preach the gospel
doctrine of remission of sins to those who are truly penitent; and he
had more signal revelations from heaven than any of them had; for he saw
heaven opened, and the Holy Ghost descend. He also had great success in
his ministry; almost the whole nation flocked to him: none rose on so
great a design, or came on so noble an errand, as John did, or had such
claims to a welcome reception. Many had been born of women that made a
great figure in the world, but Christ prefers John before them. Note,
Greatness is not to be measured by appearances and outward splendour,
but they are the greatest men who are the greatest saints, and the
greatest blessings, who are, as John was, great in the sight of the
Lord, [Luk 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#015.md).

Yet this high encomium of John has a surprising limitation,
notwithstanding, he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater
than he. \[1.\] In the kingdom of glory. John was a great and good man,
but he was yet in a state of infirmity and imperfection, and therefore
came short of glorified saints, and the spirits of just men made
perfect. Note, First, There are degrees of glory in heaven, some that
are less than others there; though every vessel is alike full, all are
not alike large and capacious. Secondly, The least saint in heaven is
greater, and knows more, and loves more, and does more in praising God,
and receives more from him, than the greatest in this world. The saints
on earth are excellent ones ([Psa
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003).md), but those in heaven are much
more excellent; the best in this world are lower than the angels ([Psa
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005).md), the least there are equal with
the angels, which should make us long for that blessed state, where the
weak shall be as David, [Zac 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008.md).
\[2.\] By the kingdom of heaven here, is rather to be understood the
kingdom of grace, the gospel dispensation in the perfection of its power
and purity; and ho mikroteros - he that is less in that is greater than
John. Some understand it of Christ himself, who was younger than John,
and, in the opinion of some, less than John, who always spoke
diminishingly of himself; I am a worm, and no man, yet greater than
John; so it agrees with what John the Baptist said ([Joh
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015).md), He that cometh after me is
preferred before me. But it is rather to be understood of the apostles
and ministers of the New Testament, the evangelical prophets; and the
comparison between them and John is not with respect to their personal
sanctity, but to their office; John preached Christ coming, but they
preached Christ not only come, but crucified and glorified. John came to
the dawning of the gospel-day, and therein excelled the foregoing
prophets, but he was taken off before the noon of that day, before the
rending of the veil, before Christ's death and resurrection, and the
pouring out of the Spirit; so that the least of the apostles and
evangelists, having greater discoveries made to them, and being employed
in a greater embassy, is greater than John. John did no miracles; the
apostles wrought many. The ground of this preference is laid in the
preference of the New Testament dispensation to that of the Old
Testament. Ministers of the New Testament therefore excel, because their
ministration does so, [Co2 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006.md), etc.
John was a maximum quod sic - the greatest of his order; he went to the
utmost that the dispensation he was under would allow; but minimum
maximi est majus maximo minimi - the least of the highest order is
superior to the first of the lowest; a dwarf upon a mountain sees
further than a giant in the valley. Note, All the true greatness of men
is derived fRom. and denominated by, the gracious manifestation of
Christ to them. The best men are no better than he is pleased to make
them. What reason have we to be thankful that our lot is cast in the
days of the kingdom of heaven, under such advantages of light and love!
And the greater the advantages, the greater will the account be, if we
receive the grace of God in vain.

(4.) The great commendation of John the Baptist was, that God owned his
ministry, and made it wonderfully successful for the breaking of the
ice, and the preparing of people for the kingdom of heaven. From the
days of the first appearing of John the Baptist, until now (which was
not much above two years), a great deal of good was done; so quick was
the motion when it came near to Christ the Centre; The kingdom of heaven
suffereth violence - biazetai - vim patitur, like the violence of an
army taking a city by storm, or of a crowd bursting into a house, so the
violent take it by force. The meaning of this we have in the parallel
place, [Luk 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#016.md). Since that time the
kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it. Multitudes
are wrought upon by the ministry of John, and become his disciples. And
it is

\[1.\] An improbable multitude. Those strove for a place in this
kingdom, that one would think had no right nor title to it, and so
seemed to be intruders, and to make a tortuous entry, as our law calls
it, a wrongful and forcible one. When the children of the kingdom are
excluded out of it, and many come into it from the east and the west,
then it suffers violence. Compare this with [Mat
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#031.md), [Mat
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#032.md). The publicans and harlots
believed John, whom the scribes and Pharisees rejected, and so went into
the kingdom of God before them, took it over their heads, while they
trifled. Note, It is no breach of good manners to go to heaven before
our betters: and it is a great commendation of the gospel from the days
of its infancy, that it has brought many to holiness that were very
unlikely.

\[2.\] An importunate multitude. This violence denotes a strength, and
vigour, and earnestness of desire and endeavour, in those who followed
John's ministry, else they would not have come so far to attend upon it.
It shows us also, what fervency and zeal are required of all those who
design to make heaven of their religion. Note, They who would enter into
the kingdom of heaven must strive to enter; that kingdom suffers a holy
violence; self must be denied, the bent and bias, the frame and temper,
of the mind must be altered; there are hard sufferings to be undergone,
a force to be put upon the corrupt nature; we must run, and wrestle, and
fight, and be in an agony, and all little enough to win such a prize,
and to get over such opposition from without and from within. The
violent take it by force. They who will have an interest in the great
salvation are carried out towards it with a strong desire, will have it
upon any terms, and not think them hard, nor quit their hold without a
blessing, [Gen 32:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#026.md). They who will
make their calling and election sure must give diligence. The kingdom of
heaven was never intended to indulge the ease of triflers, but to be the
rest of them that labour. It is a blessed sight; Oh that we could see a
greater number, not with an angry contention thrusting others out of the
kingdom of heaven, but with a holy contention thrusting themselves into
it!

(5.) The ministry of John was the beginning of the gospel, as it is
reckoned, [Mar 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001.md); [Act
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022.md). This is shown here in two
things:

\[1.\] In John the Old Testament dispensation began to die, [Mat
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#013.md). So long that ministration
continued in full force and virtue, but then it began to decline. Though
the obligation of the law of Moses was not removed till Christ's death,
yet the discoveries of the Old Testament began to be superseded by the
more clear manifestation of the kingdom of heaven as at hand. Because
the light of the gospel (as that of nature) was to precede and make way
for its law, therefore the prophecies of the Old Testament came to an
end (finis perficiens, not interficiens - an end of completion, not of
duration), before the precepts of it; so that when Christ says, all the
prophets and the law prophesied until John, he shows us, First, How the
light of the Old Testament was set up; it was set up in the law and the
prophets, who spoke, though darkly, of Christ and his kingdom. Observe,
The law is said to prophesy, as well as the prophets, concerning him
that was to come. Christ began at Moses ([Luk
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#027).md); Christ was foretold by the
dumb signs of the Mosaic work, as well as by the more articulate voices
of the prophets, and was exhibited, not only in the verbal predictions,
but in the personal and real types. Blessed be God that we have both the
New Testament doctrine to explain the Old Testament prophecies, and the
Old Testament prophecies to confirm and illustrate the New Testament
doctrine ([Heb 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001).md); like the two
cherubim, they look at each other. The law was given by Moses long ago,
and there had been no prophets for three hundred years before John, and
yet they are both said to prophecy until John, because the law was still
observed, and Moses and the prophets still read. Note, The scripture is
teaching to this day, though the penmen of it are gone. Moses and the
prophets are dead; the apostles and evangelists are dead ([Zac
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#005).md), but the word of the Lord endures
for ever ([Pe1 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#025).md); the scripture is
speaking expressly, though the writers are silent in the dust. Secondly,
How this light was laid aside: when he says, they prophesied until John,
he intimates, that their glory was eclipsed by the glory which excelled;
their predictions superseded by John's testimony, Behold the Lamb of
God! Even before the sun rises, the morning light makes candles to shine
dim. Their prophecies of a Christ to come became out of date, when John
said, He is come.

\[2.\] In him the New Testament day began to dawn; for ([Mat
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#014).md) This is Elias, that was for to
come. John was as the loop that coupled the two Testaments; as Noah was
Fibula utriusque mundi - the link connecting both worlds, so was he
utriusque Testamenti - the link connecting both Testaments. The
concluding prophecy of the Old Testament was, Behold, I will send you
Elijah, [Mal 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005.md), [Mal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006.md). Those words prophesied until
John, and then, being turned into a history, they ceased to prophecy.
First, Christ speaks of it as a great truth, that John the Baptist is
the Elias of the New Testament; not Elias in propria persona - in his
own person, as the carnal Jews expected; he denied that ([Joh
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#021).md), but one that should come in the
spirit and power of Elias ([Luk 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017).md),
like him in temper and conversation, that should press repentance with
terrors, and especially as it is in the prophecy, that should turn the
hearts of the fathers to the children. Secondly, He speaks of it as a
truth, which would not be easily apprehended by those whose expectations
fastened upon the temporal kingdom of the Messiah, and introductions to
it agreeable. Christ suspects the welcome of it, if ye will receive it.
Not but that it was true, whether they would receive it or not, but he
upbraids them with their prejudices, that they were backward to receive
the greatest truths that were opposed to their sentiments, though never
so favourable to their interests. Or, "If you will receive him, or if
you will receive the ministry of John as that of the promised Elias, he
will be an Elias to you, to turn you and prepare you for the Lord,"
Note, Gospel truths are as they are received, a savour of life or death.
Christ is a Saviour, and John an Elias, to those who will receive the
truth concerning them.

Lastly, Our Lord Jesus closes this discourse with a solemn demand of
attention ([Mat 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#015).md): He that hath
ears to hear, let him hear; which intimates, that those things were dark
and hard to be understood, and therefore needed attention, but of great
concern and consequence, and therefore well deserved it. "Let all people
take notice of this, if John be the Elias prophesied of, then certainly
here is a great revolution on foot, the Messiah's kingdom is at the
door, and the world will shortly be surprised into a happy change. These
are things which require your serious consideration, and therefore you
are all concerned to hearken to what I say." Note, The things of God are
of great and common concern: every one that has ears to hear any thing,
is concerned to hear this. It intimates, that God requires no more from
us but the right use and improvement of the faculties he has already
given us. He requires those to hear that have ears, those to use their
reason that have reason. Therefore people are ignorant, not because they
want power, but because they want will; therefore they do not hear,
because, like the deaf adder, they stop their ears.

[Matthew 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 11:16</span></span>

Christ was going on in the praise of John the Baptist and his ministry,
but here stops on a sudden, and turns that to the reproach of those who
enjoyed both that, and the ministry of Christ and his apostles too, in
vain. As to that generation, we may observe to whom he compares them
([Mat 11:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#016).md), and as to the
particular places he instances in, we may observe with whom he compares
them, [Mat 11:20-24](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020.md).

I. As to that generation, the body of the Jewish people at that time.
There were many indeed that pressed into the kingdom of heaven; but the
generality continued in unbelief and obstinacy. John was a great and
good man, but the generation in which his lot was cast was as barren and
unprofitable as could be, and unworthy of him. Note, The badness of the
places where good ministers live serves for a foil to their beauty. It
was Noah's praise that he was righteous in his generation. Having
commended John, he condemns those who had him among them, and did not
profit by his ministry. Note, The more praise-worthy the people are, if
they slight him, and so it will be found in the day of account.

This our Lord Jesus here sets forth in a parable, yet speaks as if he
were at a loss to find out a similitude proper to represent this,
Whereunto shall I liken this generation? Note, There is not a greater
absurdity than that which they are guilty of who have good preaching
among them, and are never the better for it. It is hard to say what they
are like. The similitude is taken from some common custom among the
Jewish children at their play, who, as is usual with children, imitated
the fashions of grown people at their marriages and funerals, rejoicing
and lamenting; but being all a jest, it made no impression; no more did
the ministry either of John the Baptist or of Christ upon that
generation. He especially reflects on the scribes and Pharisees, who had
a proud conceit of themselves; therefore to humble them he compares them
to children, and their behaviour to children's play.

The parable will be best explained by opening it and the illustration of
it together in these five observations.

Note, 1. The God of heaven uses a variety of proper means and methods
for the conversion and salvation of poor souls; he would have all men to
be saved, and therefore leaves no stone unturned in order to it. The
great thing he aims at, is the melting of our wills into a compliance
with the will of God, and in order to this the affecting of us with the
discoveries he has made of himself. Having various affections to be
wrought upon, he uses various ways of working upon them, which though
differing one from another, all tend to the same thing, and God is in
them all carrying on the same design. In the parable, this is called his
piping to us, and his mourning to us; he hath piped to us in the
precious promises of the gospel, proper to work upon hope, and mourned
to us in the dreadful threatenings of the law, proper to work upon fear,
that he might frighten us out of our sins and allure us to himself. He
had piped to us in gracious and merciful providences, mourned to us in
calamitous, afflicting providences, and has set the one over against the
other. He has taught his ministers to change their voice ([Gal
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#020).md); sometimes to speak in thunder
from mount Sinai, sometimes in a still small voice from mount Sion.

In the explanation of the parable is set forth the different temper of
John's ministry and of Christ's, who were the two great lights of that
generation.

(1.) On the one hand, John came mourning to them, neither eating nor
drinking; not conversing familiarly with people, nor ordinarily eating
in company, but alone, in his cell in the wilderness, where his meat was
locusts and wild honey. Now this, one would think, should work upon
them; for such an austere, mortified life as this, was very agreeable to
the doctrine he preached: and that minister is most likely to do good,
whose conversation is according to his doctrine; and yet the preaching
even of such a minister is not always effectual.

(2.) On the other hand, the Son of man came eating and drinking, and so
he piped unto them. Christ conversed familiarly with all sorts of
people, not affecting any peculiar strictness or austerity; he was
affable and easy of access, not shy of any company, was often at feasts,
both with Pharisees and publicans, to try if this would win upon those
who were not wrought upon by John's reservedness: those who were not
awed by John's frowns, would be allured by Christ's smiles; from whom
St. Paul learned to be come all things to all men, [Co1
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#022.md). Now our Lord Jesus, by his
freedom, did not at all condemn John, any more than John did condemn
him, though their deportment was so very different. Note, Though we are
never so clear in the goodness of our own practice, yet we must not
judge of others by it. There may be a great diversity of operations,
where it is the same God that worketh all in all ([Co1
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#006).md), and this various manifestation
of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal, [Mat
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#007.md). Observe especially, that God's
ministers are variously gifted: the ability and genius of some lie one
way, of others, another way: some are Boanerges - sons of thunder;
others, Barnabeses - sons of consolation; yet all these worketh that one
and the self-same Spirit ([Co1 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#011).md),
and therefore we ought not to condemn either, but to praise both, and
praise God for both, who thus tries various ways of dealing with persons
of various tempers, that sinners may be either made pliable or left
inexcusable, so that, whatever the issue is, God will be glorified.

Note, 2. The various methods which God takes for the conversion of
sinners, are with many fruitless and ineffectual: "Ye have not danced,
ye have not lamented; you have not been suitably affected either with
the one or with the other." Particular means have, as in medicine, their
particular intentions, which must be answered, particular impressions,
which must be submitted to, in order to the success of the great and
general design; now if people will be neither bound by laws, nor invited
by promises, nor frightened by threatenings, will neither be awakened by
the greatest things, nor allured by the sweetest things, nor startled by
the most terrible things, nor be made sensible by the plainest things;
if they will hearken to the voice neither of scripture, nor reason, nor
experience, nor providence, nor conscience, nor interest, what more can
be done? The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed, the founder
melteth in vain; reprobate silver shall men call them, [Jer
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#029.md). Ministers' labour is bestowed in
vain ([Isa 49:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004).md), and, which is a much
greater loss, the grace of God received in vain, [Co2
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001.md). Note, It is some comfort to
faithful ministers, when they see little success of their labours, that
it is no new thing for the best preachers and the best preaching in the
world to come short of the desired end. Who has believed our report? If
from the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of
those great commanders, Christ and john, returned so often empty ([Sa2
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#022).md), no marvel if ours do so, and we
prophecy to so little purpose upon dry bones.

Note, 3. That commonly those persons who do not profit by the means of
grace, are perverse, and reflect upon the ministers by whom they enjoy
those means; and because they do not get good themselves, they do all
the hurt they can to others, by raising and propagating prejudices
against the word, and the faithful preachers of it. Those who will not
comply with God, and walk after him, confront him, and walk contrary to
him. So this generation did; because they were resolved not to believe
Christ and john, and to own them, as they ought to have done, for the
best of men, they set themselves to abuse them, and to represent them as
the worst. (1.) As for John the Baptist, they say, He has a devil. They
imputed his strictness and reservedness to melancholy, and some kind or
degree of a possession of Satan. "Why should we heed him? he is a poor
hypochondriacal man, full of fancies, and under the power of a crazed
imagination." (2.) As for Jesus Christ, they imputed his free and
obliging conversation to the more vicious habit of luxury and
flesh-pleasing: Behold a gluttonous man and a wine-bibber. No reflection
could be more foul and invidious; it is the charge against the
rebellious son ([Deu 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#020).md), He is a
glutton and a drunkard; yet none could be more false and unjust; for
Christ pleased not himself ([Rom
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#003).md), nor did ever any man live such
a life of self-denial, mortification, and contempt of the world, as
Christ lived: he that was undefiled, and separate from sinners, is here
represented as in league with them, and polluted by them. Note, The most
unspotted innocency, and the most unparalleled excellency, will not
always be a fence against the reproach of tongues: nay, a man's best
gifts and best actions, which are both well intended and well calculated
for edification, may be made the matter of his reproach. The best of our
actions may become the worst of our accusations, as David's fasting,
[Psa 69:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#010.md). It was true in some sense,
that Christ was a Friend to publicans and sinners, the best Friend they
ever had, for he came into the world to save sinners, great sinners,
even the chief; so he said very feelingly, who had been himself not a
publican and sinner, but a Pharisee and sinner; but this is, and will be
to eternity, Christ's praise, and they forfeited the benefit of it who
thus turned it to his reproach.

Note, 4. That the cause of this great unfruitfulness and perverseness of
people under the means of grace, is that they are like children sitting
in the markets; they are foolish as children, froward as children,
mindless and playful as children; would they but show themselves men in
understanding, there would be some hopes of them. The market-place they
sit in is to some a place of idleness ([Mat
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#003).md); to others a place of worldly
business ([Jam 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#013).md); to all a place
of noise or diversion; so that if you ask the reason why people get so
little good by the means of grace, you will find it is because they are
slothful and trifling, and do not love to take pains; or because their
heads, and hands, and hearts are full of the world, the cares of which
choke the word, and choke their souls at last ([Eze
33:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#031.md); [Amo
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005).md); and they study to divert their
own thoughts from every thing that is serious. Thus in the markets they
are, and there they sit; in these things their hearts rest, and by them
they resolve to abide.

Note, 5. Though the means of grace be thus slighted and abused by many,
by the most, yet there is a remnant that through grace do improve them,
and answer the designs of them, to the glory of God, and the good of
their own souls. But wisdom is justified of her children. Christ is
Wisdom; in him are hid treasures of wisdom; the saints are the children
God has given him, [Heb 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013.md). The
gospel is wisdom, it is the wisdom from above: true believers are
begotten again by it, and born from above too; they are wise children,
wise for themselves, and their true interests; not like the foolish
children that sat in the markets. These children of wisdom justify
wisdom; they comply with the designs of Christ's grace, answer the
intentions of it, and are suitably affected with, and impressed by, the
various methods it takes, and so evidence the wisdom of Christ in taking
these methods. This is explained, [Luk
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#029.md). The publicans justified God,
being baptized with the baptism of John, and afterwards embracing the
gospel of Christ. Note, The success of the means of grace justifies the
wisdom of God in the choice of these means, against those who charge him
with folly therein. The cure of every patient, that observes the
physician's orders, justifies the wisdom of the physician: and therefore
Paul is not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, because, whatever it is to
others, to them that believe it is the power of God unto salvation, [Rom
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016.md). When the cross of Christ, which
to others is foolishness and a stumbling-block, is to them that are
called the wisdom of God and the power of God ([Co1
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#023.md), [Co1
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#024).md), so that they make the knowledge
of that the summit of their ambition ([Co1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#002).md), and the efficacy of that the
crown of their glorying ([Gal 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#014).md),
here is wisdom justified of her children. Wisdom's children are wisdom's
witnesses in the world ([Isa 43:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010).md),
and shall be produced as witnesses in that day, when wisdom, that is now
justified by the saints, shall be glorified in the saints, and admired
in all them that believe, [Th2 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#010.md).
If the unbelief of some reproach Christ by giving him the lie, the faith
of others shall honour him by setting to its seal that he is true, and
that he also is wise, [Co1 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#025.md).
Whether we do it or not, it will be done; not only God's equity, but his
wisdom, will be justified when he speaks, when he judges.

Well, this is the account Christ gives of that generation, and that
generation is not passed away, but remains in a succession of the like;
for as it was then, it has been since and is still; some believe the
things which are spoken, and some believe not, [Act
28:24](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#024.md).

II\. As to the particular places in which Christ was most conversant.
What he said in general of that generation, he applied in particular to
those places, to affect them. Then began he to upbraid them, [Mat
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020.md). He began to preach to them long
before ([Mat 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#017).md), but he did not
begin to upbraid till now. Note, Rough and unpleasing methods must not
be taken, till gentler means have first been used. Christ is not apt to
upbraid; he gives liberally, and upbraideth not, till sinners by their
obstinacy extort it from him. Wisdom first invites, but when her
invitations are slighted, then she upbraids, [Pro
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020.md), [Pro
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#024.md). Those do not go in Christ's
method, who begin with upbraidings. Now observe,

1\. The sin charged upon them; not any against the moral law, then an
appeal would have lain to the gospel, which would have relieved, but a
sin against the gospel, the remedial law, and that is impenitency: this
was it he upbraided them with, or reproached them for, as the most
shameful, ungrateful thing that could be, that they repented not. Note,
Wilful impenitency is the great damning sin of multitudes that enjoy the
gospel, and which (more than any other) sinners will be upbraided with
to eternity. The great doctrine that both John the Baptist, and Christ,
and the apostles preached, was repentance; the great thing designed,
both in the piping and in the mourning, was to prevail with people to
change their minds and ways, to leave their sins and turn to God; and
this they would not be brought to. He does not say, because they
believed not (for some king of faith many of them had) that Christ was a
Teacher come from God; but because they repented not: their faith did
not prevail to the transforming of their hearts, and the reforming of
their lives. Christ reproved them for their other sins, that he might
lead them to repentance; but when they repented not, He upbraided them
with that, as their refusal to be healed: He upbraided them with it,
that they might upbraid themselves, and might at length see the folly of
it, as that which alone makes the sad case a desperate one, and the
wound incurable.

2\. The aggravation of the sin; they were the cities in which most of
his mighty works were done; for thereabouts his principal residence had
been for some time. Note, Some places enjoy the means of grace in
greater plenty, power, and purity, than other places. God is a free
agent, and acts so in all his disposals, both as the God of nature and
as the God of grace, common and distinguishing grace. By Christ's mighty
works they should have been prevailed with, not only to receive his
doctrine, but to obey his law; the curing of bodily diseases should have
been the healing of their souls, but it had not that effect. Note, The
stronger inducements we have to repent, the more heinous is the
impenitency and the severer will the reckoning be, for Christ keeps
account of the mighty works done among us, and of the gracious works
done for us too, by which also we should be led to repentance, [Rom
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004.md).

(1.) Chorazin and Bethsaida are here instanced ([Mat
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#021.md), [Mat
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#022).md), they have each of them their
woe: Woe unto thee, Chorazin, woe unto thee, Bethsaida. Christ came into
the world to bless us; but if that blessing be slighted, he has woes in
reserve, and his woes are of all others the most terrible. These two
cities were situate upon the sea of Galilee, the former on the east
side, and the latter on the west, rich and populous places; Bethsaida
was lately advanced to a city by Philip the tetrarch; out of it Christ
took at least three of his apostles: thus highly were these places
favoured! Yet because they knew not the day of their visitation, they
fell under these woes, which stuck so close to them, that soon after
this they decayed, and dwindled into mean, obscure villages. So fatally
does sin ruin cities, and so certainly does the word of Christ take
place!

Now Chorazin and Bethsaida are here compared with Tyre and Sidon, two
maritime cities we read much of in the Old Testament, that had been
brought to ruin, but began to flourish again; these cities bordered upon
Galilee, but were in a very ill name among the Jews for idolatry and
other wickedness. Christ sometimes went into the coasts of Tyre and
Sidon ([Mat 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#021).md), but never thither;
the Jews would have taken it very heinously if he had; therefore Christ,
to convince and humble them, here shows,

\[1.\] That Tyre and Sidon would not have been so bad as Chorazin and
Bethsaida. If they had had the same word preached, and the same miracles
wrought among them, they would have repented, and that long ago, as
Nineveh did, in sackcloth and ashes. Christ, who knows the hearts of
all, knew that if he had gone and lived among them, and preached among
them, he should have done more good there than where he was; yet he
continued where he was for some time, to encourage his ministers to do
so, though they see not the success they desire. Note, Among the
children of disobedience, some are more easily wrought upon than others;
and it is a great aggravation of the impenitency of those who
plentifully enjoy the means of grace, not only that there are many who
sit under the same means that are wrought upon, but that there are many
more that would have been wrought upon, if they had enjoyed the same
means. See [Eze 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#006.md), [Eze
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#007.md). Our repentance is slow and
delayed, but theirs would have been speedy; they would have repented
long ago. Ours has been slight and superficial; theirs would have been
deep and serious, in sackcloth and ashes. Yet we must observe, with an
awful adoration of the divine sovereignty, that the Tyrians and
Sidonians will justly perish in their sin, though, if they had had the
means of grace, they would have repented; for God is a debtor to no man.

\[2.\] That therefore Tyre and Sidon shall not be so miserable as
Chorazin and Bethsaida, but it shall be more tolerable for them in the
day of judgment, [Mat 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#022.md). Note,
First, At the day of judgment the everlasting state of the children of
men will, by an unerring and unalterable doom, be determined; happiness
or misery, and the several degrees of each. Therefore it is called the
eternal judgment ([Heb 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#002).md), because
decisive of the eternal state. Secondly, In that judgment, all the means
of grace that were enjoyed in the state of probation will certainly come
into the account, and it will be enquired, not only how bad we were, but
how much better we might have been, had it not been our own fault, [Isa
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#003.md), [Isa
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#004.md). Thirdly, Though the damnation of
all that perish will be intolerable, yet the damnation of those who had
the fullest and clearest discoveries made them of the power and grace of
Christ, and yet repented not, will be of all others the most
intolerable. The gospel light and sound open the faculties, and enlarge
the capacities of all that see and hear it, either to receive the riches
of divine grace, or (if that grace be slighted) to take in the more
plentiful effusions of divine wrath. If self-reproach be the torture of
hell, it must needs be hell indeed to those who had such a fair
opportunity of getting to heaven. Son, remember that.

(2.) Capernaum is here condemned with an emphasis ([Mat
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#023).md), "And thou, Capernaum, hold up
thy hand, and hear they doom," Capernaum, above all the cities of
Israel, was dignified with Christ's most usual residence; it was like
Shiloh of old, the place which he chose, to put his name there, and it
fared with it as with Shiloh, [Jer
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#012.md), [Jer
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#014.md). Christ's miracles here were
daily bread, and therefore, as the manna of old, were despised and
called light bread. Many a sweet and comfortable lecture of grace Christ
had read them to little purpose, and therefore he reads them a dreadful
lecture of wrath: those who will not hear the former shall be made to
feel the latter.

We have here Capernaum's doom,

\[1.\] Put absolutely; Thou which art exalted to heaven shalt be brought
down to hell Note, First, Those who enjoy the gospel in power and
purity, are thereby exalted to heaven; they have therein a great honour
for the present, and a great advantage for eternity; they are lifted up
toward heaven; but if, notwithstanding, they still cleave to the earth,
they may thank themselves that they are not lifted up into heaven.
Secondly, Gospel advantages and advancements abused will sink sinners so
much lower into hell. Our external privileges will be so far from saving
us, that if our hearts and lives be not agreeable to them, they will but
inflame the reckoning: the higher the precipice is, the more fatal is
the fall from it: Let us not therefore be high-minded, but fear; not
slothful, but diligent. See [Job 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#006.md),
[Job 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#007.md).

\[2.\] We have it here put in comparison with the doom of Sodom - a
place more remarkable, both for sin and ruin, than perhaps any other;
and yet Christ here tells us,

First, That Capernaum's means would have saved Sodom. If these miracles
had been done among the Sodomites, as bad as they were, they would have
repented, and their city would have remained unto this day a monument of
sparing mercy, as now it is of destroying justice, [Jde
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007.md). Note, Upon true repentance
through Christ, even the greatest sin shall be pardoned and the greatest
ruin prevented, that of Sodom not excepted. Angels were sent to Sodom,
and yet it remained not; but if Christ had been sent thither, it would
have remained; how well is it for us, then, that the world to come is
put in subjection to Christ, and not to angels! [Heb
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#005.md). Lot would not have seemed as one
that mocked, if he had wrought miracles.

Secondly, That Sodom's ruin will therefore be less at the great day than
Capernaum's. Sodom will have many things to answer for, but not the sin
of neglecting Christ, as Capernaum will. If the gospel prove a savour of
death, a killing savour, it is doubly so; it is of death unto death, so
great a death ([Co2 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016).md); Christ had
said the same of all other places that receive not his ministers nor bid
his gospel welcome ([Mat 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#015).md); It
shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom than for that city. We
that have now the written word in our hands, the gospel preached, and
the gospel ordinances administered to us, and live under the
dispensation of the Spirit, have advantages not inferior to those of
Chorazin, and Bethsaida, and Capernaum, and the account in the great day
will be accordingly. It has therefore been justly said, that the
professors of this age, whether they go to heaven or hell, will be the
greatest debtors in either of these places; if to heaven, the greatest
debtors to divine mercy for those rich means that brought them thither;
if to hell, the greatest debtors to divine justice, for those rich means
that would have kept them from thence.

[Matthew 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 11:25</span></span>

In these verses we have Christ looking up to heaven, with thanksgiving
to his Father for the sovereignty and security of the covenant of
redemption; and looking around him upon this earth, with an offer to all
the children of men, to whom these presents shall come, of the
privileges and benefits of the covenant of grace.

I. Christ here returns thanks to God for his favour to those babes who
had the mysteries of the gospel revealed to them ([Mat
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025.md), [Mat
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#026).md). Jesus answered and said. It is
called an answer, though no other words are before recorded but his own,
because it is so comfortable a reply to the melancholy considerations
preceding, and is aptly set in the balance against them. The sin and
ruin of those woeful cities, no doubt, was a grief to the Lord Jesus; he
could not but weep over them, as he did over Jerusalem ([Luk
19:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#041).md); with this thought therefore he
refreshes himself; and to make it the more refreshing, he puts it into a
thanksgiving; that for all this, there is a remnant, though but babes,
to whom the things of the gospel are revealed. Though Israel be not
gathered, yet shall he be glorious. Note, We may take great
encouragement in looking upward to God, when round about us we see
nothing but what is discouraging. It is sad to see how regardless most
men are of their own happiness, but it is comfortable to think that the
wise and faithful God will, however, effectually secure the interests of
his own glory. Jesus answered and said, I thank thee. Note, Thanksgiving
is a proper answer to dark and disquieting thoughts, and may be an
effectual means to silence them. Songs of praise are sovereign cordials
to drooping souls, and will help to cure melancholy. When we have no
other answer ready to the suggestions of grief and fear, we may have
recourse to this, I thank thee, O Father; let us bless God that it is
not worse with us than it is.

Now in this thanksgiving of Christ, we may observe,

1\. The titles he gives to God; O Father, Lord of heaven and earth.
Note, (1.) In all our approaches to God, by praise as well as by prayer,
it is good for us to eye him as a Father, and to fasten on that
relation, not only when we ask for the mercies we want, but when we give
thanks for the mercies we have received. Mercies are then doubly sweet,
and powerful to enlarge the heart in praise, when they are received as
tokens of a Father's love, and gifts of a Father's hand; Giving thanks
to the Father, [Col 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012.md). It becomes
children to be grateful, and to say, Thank you, father, as readily as,
Pray, father. (2.) When we come to God as a Father, we must withal
remember, that he is Lord of heaven and earth; which obliges us to come
to him with reverence, as to the sovereign Lord of all, and yet with
confidence, as one able to do for us whatever we need or can desire; to
defend us from all evil and to supply us with all good. Christ, in
Melchizedec, had long since blessed God as the Possessor, or Lord of
heaven and earth; and in all our thanksgivings for mercies in the
stream, we must give him the glory of the all-sufficiency that is in the
fountain.

2\. The thing he gives thanks for: Because thou has hid these things
from the wise and prudent, and yet revealed them to babes. These things;
he does not say what things, but means the great things of the gospel,
the things that belong to our peace, [Luk
19:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#042.md). he spoke thus emphatically of
them, these things, because they were things that filled him, and should
fill us: all other things are as nothing to these things.

Note (1.) The great things of the everlasting gospel have been and are
hid from many that were wise and prudent, that were eminent for learning
and worldly policy; some of the greatest scholars and the greatest
statesmen have been the greatest strangers to gospel mysteries. The
world by wisdom knew not God, [Co1
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021.md). Nay, there is an opposition
given to the gospel, by a science falsely so called, [Ti1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020.md). Those who are most expert in
things sensible and secular, are commonly least experienced in spiritual
things. Men may dive deeply into the mysteries of nature and into the
mysteries of state, and yet be ignorant of, and mistake about, the
mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, for want of an experience of the
power of them.

(2.) While the wise and prudent men of the world are in the dark about
gospel mysteries, even the babes in Christ have the sanctifying saving
knowledge of them: Thou hast revealed them unto babes. Such the
disciples of Christ were; men of mean birth and education; no scholars,
no artists, no politicians, unlearned and ignorant men, [Act
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013.md). Thus are the secrets of wisdom,
which are double to that which is ([Job
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#006).md), made known to babes and
sucklings, that out of their mouth strength might be ordained ([Psa
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#002).md), and God's praise thereby
perfected. The learned men of the world were not made choice of to be
the preachers of the gospel, but the foolish things of the world ([Co1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md), [Co1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008.md), [Co1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010).md).

(3.) This difference between the prudent and the babes is of God's own
making. \[1.\] It is he that has hid these things from the wise and
prudent; he gave them parts, and learning, and much of human
understanding above others, and they were proud of that, and rested in
it, and looked no further; and therefore God justly denies them the
Spirit of wisdom and revelation, and then, though they hear the sound of
the gospel tidings, they are to them as a strange thing. God is not the
Author of their ignorance and error, but he leaves them to themselves,
and their sin becomes their punishment, and the Lord is righteous in it.
See [Joh 12:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#039.md), [Joh
12:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#040.md); [Rom
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#007.md), [Rom
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#008.md); [Act
28:26](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#026.md), [Act
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#027.md). Had they honoured God with the
wisdom and prudence they had, he would have given them the knowledge of
these better things; but because they served their lusts with them, he
has hid their hearts from this understanding. \[2.\] It is he that has
revealed them unto babes. Things revealed belong to our children ([Deu
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#029).md), and to them he gives an
understanding to receive these things, and the impressions of them. Thus
he resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble, [Jam
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006.md).

(4.) This dispensation must be resolved into the divine sovereignty.
Christ himself referred it to that; Even so, Father, for so it seemed
good in thy sight. Christ here subscribes to the will of his Father in
this matter; Even so. Let God take what ways he pleases to glorify
himself, and make us of what instruments he pleases for the carrying on
of his own work; his grace is his own, and he may give or withhold it as
he pleases. We can give no reason why Peter, a fisherman, should be made
an apostle, and not Nicodemus, a Pharisee, and a ruler of the Jews,
though he also believed in Christ; but so it seemed good in God's sight.
Christ said this in the hearing of his disciples, to show them that it
was not for any merit of their own that they were thus dignified and
distinguished, but purely from God's good pleasure; he made them to
differ.

(5.) This way of dispensing divine grace is to be acknowledged by us, as
it was by our Lord Jesus, with all thankfulness. We must thank God,
\[1.\] That these things are revealed; the mystery hid from ages and
generations is manifested; that they are revealed, not to a few, but to
be published to all the world. \[2.\] That they are revealed to babes;
that the meek and humble are beautified with this salvation; and this
honour put upon those whom the world pours contempt upon. \[3.\] It
magnifies the mercy to them, that these things are hid from the wise and
prudent: distinguishing favours are the most obliging. As Job adored the
name of the Lord in taking away as well as in giving, so may we in
hiding these things from the wise and prudent, as well as in revealing
them unto babes; not as it is their misery, but as it is a method by
which self is abased, proud thoughts brought down, all flesh silenced,
and divine power and wisdom made to shine the more bright. See [Co1
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#027.md), [Co1
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#031.md).

II\. Christ here makes a gracious offer of the benefits of the gospel to
all, and these are the things which are revealed to babes, [Mat
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025.md), etc. Observe here,

1\. The solemn preface which ushers in this call or invitation, both to
command our attention to it, and to encourage our compliance with it.
That we might have strong consolation, in flying for refuge to this hope
set before us, Christ prefixes his authority, produces his credentials;
we shall see he is empowered to make this offer.

Two things he here lays before us, [Mat
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027.md).

(1.) His commission from the Father: All things are delivered unto me of
my Father. Christ, as God, is equal in power and glory with the Father;
but as Mediator he receives his power and glory from the Father; has all
judgment committed to him. He is authorized to settle a new covenant
between God and man, and to offer peace and happiness to the apostate
world, upon such terms as he should think fit: he was sanctified and
sealed to be the sole Plenipotentiary, to concert and establish this
great affair. In order to this, he has all power both in heaven and in
earth, ([Mat 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018).md); power over all
flesh ([Joh 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#002).md); authority to
execute judgment, [Joh 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022.md), [Joh
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027.md). This encourages us to come to
Christ, that he is commissioned to receive us, and to give us what we
come for, and has all things delivered to him for that purpose, by him
who is Lord of all. All powers, all treasures are in his hand. Observe,
The Father has delivered his all into the hands of the Lord Jesus; let
us but deliver our all into his hand and the work is done; God has made
him the great Referee, the blessed Daysman, to lay his hand upon us
both; that which we have to do is to agree to the reference, to submit
to the arbitration of the Lord Jesus, for the taking up of this unhappy
controversy, and to enter into bonds to stand to his award.

(2.) His intimacy with the Father: No man knoweth the Son but the
Father, Neither knoweth any man the Father save the Son. This gives us a
further satisfaction, and an abundant one. Ambassadors use to have not
only their commissions, which they produce, but their instructions,
which they reserve to themselves, to be made use of as there is occasion
in their negotiations; our Lord Jesus had both, not only authority, but
ability, for his undertaking. In transacting the great business of our
redemption, the Father and the Son are the parties principally
concerned; the counsel of peace is between them, [Zac
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013.md). It must therefore be a great
encouragement to us to be assured, that they understood one another very
well in this affair; that the Father knew the Son, and the Son knew the
Father, and both perfectly (a mutual consciousness we may call it,
between the Father and the Son), so that there could be no mistake in
the settling of this matter; as often there is among men, to the
overthrow of contracts, and the breaking of the measures taken, through
their misunderstanding one another. The Son had lain in the bosom of the
Father from eternity; he was a secretioribus - of the cabinet-council,
[Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md). He was by him, as one
brought up with him ([Pro 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#030).md), so
that none knows the Father save the Son, he adds, and he to whom the Son
will reveal him. Note, \[1.\] The happiness of men lies in an
acquaintance with God; it is life eternal, it is the perfection of
rational beings. \[2.\] Those who would have an acquaintance with God,
must apply themselves to Jesus Christ; for the light of the knowledge of
the glory of God shines in the face of Christ, [Co2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006.md). We are obliged to Christ for all
the revelation we have of God the Father's will and love, ever since
Adam sinned; there is no comfortable intercourse between a holy God and
sinful man, but in and by a Mediator, [Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006.md).

2\. Here is the offer itself that is made to us, and an invitation to
accept of it. After so solemn a preface, we may well expect something
very great; and it is a faithful saying, and well worthy of all
acceptation; words whereby we may be saved. We are here invited to
Christ as our Priest, Prince, and Prophet, to be saved, and, in order to
that, to be ruled and taught by him.

(1.) We must come to Jesus Christ as our Rest, and repose ourselves in
him ([Mat 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028).md), Come unto me all ye
that labour. Observe, \[1.\] The character of the persons invited; all
that labour, and are heavy laden. This is a word in season to him that
is weary, [Isa 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004.md). Those who
complain of the burthen of the ceremonial law, which was an intolerable
yoke, and was made much more so by the tradition of the elders ([Luk
11:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#046).md), let them come to Christ, and
they shall be made easy; he came to free his church from this yoke, to
cancel the imposition of those carnal ordinances, and to introduce a
purer and more spiritual way of worship; but it is rather to be
understood of the burthen of sin, both the guilt and the power of it.
Note, All those, and those only, are invited to rest in Christ, that are
sensible of sin as a burthen, and groan under it; that are not only
convinced of the evil of sin, of their own sin, but are contrite in soul
for it; that are really sick of their sins, weary of the service of the
world and of the flesh; that see their state sad and dangerous by reason
of sin, and are in pain and fear about it, as Ephraim ([Jer
31:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018).md), the prodigal ([Luk
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#017).md), the publican ([Luk
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#013).md), Peter's hearers ([Act
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#037).md), Paul ([Act
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#004.md), [Act
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#006.md), [Act
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#009).md), the jailor ([Act
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#029.md), [Act
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#030).md). This is a necessary
preparative for pardon and peace. The Comforter must first convince
([Joh 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008).md); I have torn and then will
heal. \[2.\] The invitation itself: Come unto me. That glorious display
of Christ's greatness which we had ([Mat
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027).md), as Lord of all, might frighten
us from him, but see here how he holds out the golden sceptre, that we
may touch the top of it and may live. Note, It is the duty and interest
of weary and heavy laden sinners to come to Jesus Christ. Renouncing all
those things which stand in opposition to him, or in competition with
him, we must accept of him, as our Physician and Advocate, and give up
ourselves to his conduct and government; freely willing to be saved by
him, in his own way, and upon his own terms. Come and cast that burden
upon him, under which thou art heavy laden. This is the gospel call, The
Spirit saith, Come; and the bride saith, Come; let him that is athirst
come; Whoever will, let him come.

\[3.\] The blessing promised to those that do come: I will give you
rest. Christ is our Noah, whose name signifies rest, for this same shall
give us rest. [Gen 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#029.md); [Gen
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#009.md). Truly rest is good ([Gen
49:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#015).md), especially to those that
labour and are heavy laden, [Ecc 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#012.md).
Note, Jesus Christ will give assured rest to those weary souls, that by
a lively faith come to him for it; rest from the terror of sin, in a
well-grounded peace of conscience; rest from the power of sin, in a
regular order of the soul, and its due government of itself; a rest in
God, and a complacency of soul, in his love. [Psa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006.md), [Psa
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#007.md). This is that rest which remains
for the people of God ([Heb 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#009).md),
begun in grace, and perfected in glory.

(2.) We must come to Jesus Christ as our Ruler, and submit ourselves to
him ([Mat 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029).md). Take my yoke upon
you. This must go along with the former, for Christ is exalted to be
both a Prince and a Saviour, a Priest upon his throne. The rest he
promises is a release from the drudgery of sin, not from the service of
God, but an obligation to the duty we owe to him. Note, Christ has a
yoke for our necks, as well as a crown for our heads, and this yoke he
expects we should take upon us and draw in. To call those who are weary
and heavy laden, to take a yoke upon them, looks like adding affliction
to the afflicted; but the pertinency of it lies in the word my: "You are
under a yoke which makes you weary: shake that off and try mine, which
will make you easy." Servants are said to be under the yoke ([Ti1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001).md), and subjects, [Kg1
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#010.md). To take Christ's yoke upon us,
is to put ourselves into the relation to servants and subjects to him,
and then of conduct ourselves accordingly, in a conscientious obedience
to all his commands, and a cheerful submission to all his disposals: it
is to obey the gospel of Christ, to yield ourselves to the Lord: it is
Christ's yoke; the yoke he has appointed; a yoke he has himself drawn in
before us, for he learned obedience, and which he does by his Spirit
draw in with us, for he helpeth our infirmities, [Rom
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026.md). A yoke speaks some hardship, but
if the beast must draw, the yoke helps him. Christ's commands are all in
our favour: we must take this yoke upon us to draw in it. We are yoked
to work, and therefore must be diligent; we are yoked to submit, and
therefore must be humble and patient: we are yoked together with our
fellow-servants, and therefore must keep up the communion of saints: and
the words of the wise are as goads, to those who are thus yoked.

Now this is the hardest part of our lesson, and therefore it is
qualified ([Mat 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030).md). My yoke is
easy and my burden is light; you need not be afraid of it.

\[1.\] The yoke of Christ's commands is an easy yoke; it is chrēstos,
not only easy, but gracious, so the word signifies; it is sweet and
pleasant; there is nothing in it to gall the yielding neck, nothing to
hurt us, but, on the contrary, must to refresh us. It is a yoke that is
lined with love. Such is the nature of all Christ's commands, so
reasonable in themselves, so profitable to us, and all summed up in one
word, and that a sweet word, love. So powerful are the assistances he
gives us, so suitable the encouragements, and so strong the
consolations, that are to be found in the way of duty, that we may truly
say, it is a yoke of pleasantness. It is easy to the new nature, very
easy to him that understandeth, [Pro
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#006.md). It may be a little hard at
first, but it is easy afterwards; the love of God and the hope of heaven
will make it easy.

\[2.\] The burden of Christ's cross is a light burden, very light:
afflictions from Christ, which befall us as men; afflictions for Christ,
which befall us as Christians; the latter are especially meant. This
burden in itself is not joyous, but grievous; yet as it is Christ's, it
is light. Paul knew as much of it as any man, and he calls it a light
affliction, [Co2 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017.md). God's presence
([Isa 43:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#002).md), Christ's sympathy (Isa.
73:9, [Dan 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#025).md), and especially the
Spirit's aids and comforts ([Co2 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#005).md),
make suffering for Christ light and easy. As afflictions abound, and are
prolonged, consolations abound, and are prolonged too. Let this
therefore reconcile us to the difficulties, and help us over the
discouragements, we may meet with, both in doing work and suffering
work; though we may lose for Christ, we shall not lose by him.

(3.) We must come to Jesus Christ as our Teacher, and set ourselves to
learn of him, [Mat 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029.md). Christ has
erected a great school, and has invited us to be his scholars. We must
enter ourselves, associate with his scholars, and daily attend the
instructions he gives by his word and Spirit. We must converse much with
what he said, and have it ready to use upon all occasions; we must
conform to what he did, and follow his steps, [Pe1
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#021.md). Some make the following words,
for I am meek and lowly in heart, to be the particular lesson we are
required to learn from the example of Christ. We must learn of him to be
meek and lowly, and must mortify our pride and passion, which render us
so unlike to him. We must so learn of Christ as to learn Christ ([Eph
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#020).md), for he is both Teacher and
Lesson, Guide and Way, and All in All.

Two reasons are given why we must learn of Christ.

\[1.\] I am meek and lowly in heart, and therefore fit to teach you.

First, He is meek, and can have compassion on the ignorant, whom others
would be in a passion with. Many able teachers are hot and hasty, which
is a great discouragement to those who are dull and slow; but Christ
knows how to bear with such, and to open their understandings. His
carriage towards his twelve disciples was a specimen of this; he was
mild and gentle with them, and made the best of them; though they were
heedless and forgetful, he was not extreme to mark their follies.
Secondly, He is lowly in heart. He condescends to teach poor scholars,
to teach novices; he chose disciples, not from the court, nor the
schools, but from the seaside. He teaches the first principles, such
things as are milk for babes; he stoops to the meanest capacities; he
taught Ephraim to go, [Hos 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#003.md). Who
teaches like him? It is an encouragement to us to put ourselves to
school to such a Teacher. This humility and meekness, as it qualifies
him to be a Teacher, so it will be the best qualification of those who
are to be taught by him; for the meek will he guide in judgment, [Psa
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#009.md).

\[2.\] You shall find rest to your souls. This promise is borrowed from
[Jer 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#016.md), for Christ delighted to
express himself in the language of the prophets, to show the harmony
between the two Testaments. Note, First, Rest for the soul is the most
desirable rest; to have the soul to dwell at ease. Secondly, The only
way, and a sure way to find rest for our souls is, to sit at Christ's
feet and hear his word. The way of duty is the way of rest. The
understanding finds rest in the knowledge of God and Jesus Christ, and
is there abundantly satisfied, finding that wisdom in the gospel which
has been sought for in vain throughout the whole creation, [Job
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#012.md). The truths Christ teaches are
such as we may venture our souls upon. The affections find rest in the
love of God and Jesus Christ, and meet with that in them which gives
them an abundant satisfaction; quietness and assurance for ever. And
those satisfactions will be perfected and perpetuated in heaven, where
we shall see and enjoy God immediately, shall see him as he is, and
enjoy him as he is ours. This rest is to be had with Christ for all
those who learn of him.

Well, this is the sum and substance of the gospel call and offer: we are
here told, in a few words, what the Lord Jesus requires of us, and it
agrees with what God said of him once and again. This is my beloved Son,
in whom I am well pleased, hear ye him.
