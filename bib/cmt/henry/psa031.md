### [Psalms Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 31:0</span></span>

It is probable that David penned this psalm when he was persecuted by
Saul; some passages in it agree particularly to the narrow escapes he
had, at Keilah ([Sa1 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#013).md), then in
the wilderness of Maon, when Saul marched on one side of the hill and he
on the other, and, soon after, in the cave in the wilderness of En-gedi;
but that it was penned upon any of those occasions we are not told. It
is a mixture of prayers, and praises, and professions of confidence in
God, all which do well together and are helpful to one another. I. David
professes his cheerful confidence in God, and, in that confidence, prays
for deliverance out of his present troubles ([Psa
31:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#001).md). II. He complains of the very
deplorable condition he was in, and, in the sense of his calamities,
still prays that God would graciously appear for him against his
persecutors ([Psa 31:9-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#009).md). III. He
concludes the psalm with praise and triumph, giving glory to God, and
encouraging himself and others to trust in him ([Psa
31:19-24](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#019).md).

To the chief musician. A psalm of David.

[Psalms 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 31:1</span></span>

Faith and prayer must go together. He that believes, let his pray - I
believe, therefore I have spoken: and he that prays, let him believe,
for the prayer of faith is the prevailing prayer. We have both here.

I. David, in distress, is very earnest with God in prayer for succour
and relief. This eases a burdened spirit, fetches in promised mercies,
and wonderfully supports and comforts the soul in the expectation of
them. He prays, 1. That God would deliver him ([Psa
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#001).md), that his life might be
preserved from the malice of his enemies, and that an end might be put
to their persecutions of him, that God, not only in his mercy, but in
righteousness, would deliver him, as a righteous Judge betwixt him and
his unrighteous persecutors, that he would bow down his ear to his
petitions, to his appeals, and deliver him, [Psa
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#002.md). It is condescension in God to
take cognizance of the case of the greatest and best of men; he humbles
himself to do it. The psalmist prays also that he would deliver him
speedily, lest, if the deliverance were long deferred, his faith should
fail. 2. That if he did not immediately deliver him out of his troubles,
yet he would protect and shelter him in his troubles; "Be thou my strong
rock, immovable, impregnable, as a fastness framed by nature, and my
house of defence, a fortress framed by art, and all to save me." Thus we
may pray that God's providence would secure to us our lives and
comforts, and that by his grace we may be enabled to think ourselves
safe in him, [Pro 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010.md). 3. That his
case having much in it of difficulty, both in respect of duty and in
respect of prudence, he might be under the divine guidance: "Lord, lead
me and guide me ([Psa 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#003).md), so order
my steps, so order my spirit, that I may never do any thing unlawful and
unjustifiable - against my conscience, nor unwise and indiscreet -
against my interest." Those that resolve to follow God's direction may
in faith pray for it. 4. That his enemies being very crafty, as well as
very spiteful, God would frustrate and baffle their designs against him
([Psa 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#004).md): "Pull me out of the net
that they have laid privily for me, and keep me from the sin, the
trouble, the death, they aim to entrap me in."

II\. In this prayer he gives glory to God by a repeated profession of
his confidence in him and dependence on him. This encouraged his prayers
and qualified him for the mercies he prayed for ([Psa
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#001).md): "In thee, O Lord! do I put my
trust, and not in myself, or any sufficiency of my own, or in any
creature; let me never be ashamed, let me not be disappointed of any of
that good which thou hast promised me and which therefore I have
promised myself in thee." 1. He had chosen God for his protector, and
God had, by his promise, undertaken to be so ([Psa
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#003).md): "Thou art my rock and my
fortress, by thy covenant with me and my believing consent to that
covenant; therefore be my strong rock," [Psa
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#002.md). Those that have in sincerity
avouched the Lord for theirs may expect the benefit of his being so; for
God's relations to us carry with them both name and thing. Thou art my
strength, [Psa 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#004.md). If God be our
strength, we may hope that he will both put his strength in us and put
forth his strength for us. 2. He gave up his soul in a special manner to
him ([Psa 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#005).md): Into thy hands I
commit my spirit. (1.) If David here looks upon himself as a dying man,
by these words he resigns his departing soul to God who gave it, and to
whom, at death, the spirit returns. "Men can but kill the body, but I
trust in God to redeem my soul from the power of the grave," [Psa
49:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#015.md). He is willing to die if God
will have it so; but let my soul fall into the hands of the Lord, for
his mercies are great. With these words our Lord Jesus yielded up the
ghost upon the cross, and made his soul an offering, a free-will
offering for sin, voluntarily laying down his life a ransom. By
Stephen's example we are taught in, our dying moment, to eye Christ at
God's right hand, and to commit our spirits to him: Lord Jesus, receive
my spirit. But, 2. David is here to be looked upon as a man in distress
and trouble. And, \[1.\] His great care is about his soul, his spirit,
his better part. Note, Our outward afflictions should increase our
concern for our souls. Many think that while they are perplexed about
their worldly affairs, and Providence multiplies their cares about them,
they may be excused if they neglect their souls; whereas the greater
hazard our lives and secular interests lie at the more we are concerned
to look to our souls, that, though the outward man perish, the inward
man may suffer no damage ([Co2 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#016).md),
and that we may keep possession of our souls when we can keep possession
of nothing else, [Luk 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#019.md). \[2.\] He
thinks the best he can do for the soul is to commit it into the hand of
God, and lodge that great trust with him. He had prayed ([Psa
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#004).md) to be plucked out of the net of
outward trouble, but, as not insisting upon that (God's will be done),
he immediately lets fall that petition, and commits the spirit, the
inward man, into God's hand. "Lord, however it goes with me, as to my
body, let it go well with my soul." Note, It is the wisdom and duty of
every one of us solemnly to commit our spirits into the hands of God, to
be sanctified by his grace, devoted to his honour, employed in his
service, and fitted for his kingdom. That which encourages us to commit
our spirits into the hand of God is that he has not only created, but
redeemed, them; the particular redemptions of the Old Testament church
and the Old Testament saints were typical of our redemption by Jesus
Christ, [Gen 48:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#016.md). The redemption of
the soul is so precious that it must have ceased for ever if Christ had
not undertaken it; but, by redeeming our souls, he has not only acquired
an additional right and title to them, which obliges us to commit them
to him as his own, but has shown the extraordinary kindness and concern
he has for them, which encourages us to commit them to him, to be
preserved to his heavenly kingdom ([Ti2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012).md): "Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord
God of truth! redeem me according to a promise which thou wilt be true
to."

III\. He disclaimed all confederacy with those that made an arm of flesh
their confidence ([Psa 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#006).md): I have
hated those that regard lying vanities - idolaters (to some), who expect
aid from false gods, which are vanity and a lie - astrologers, and those
that give heed to them, so others. David abhorred the use of
enchantments and divinations; he consulted not, nor even took notice of,
the flight of birds or entrails of beasts, good omens or bad omens; they
are lying vanities, and he not only did not regard them himself, but
hated the wickedness of those that did. He trusted in God only, and not
in any creature. His interest in the court or country, his retreats or
strongholds, even Goliath's sword itself - these were lying vanities,
which he could not depend upon, but trusted in the Lord only. See [Psa
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004.md); [Jer
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#005.md).

IV\. He comforted himself with his hope in God, and made himself, not
only easy, but cheerful, with it, [Psa
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#007.md). Having relied on God's mercy, he
will be glad and rejoice in it; and those know not how to value their
hope in God who cannot find joy enough in that hope to counterbalance
their grievances and silence their griefs.

V. He encouraged himself in this hope with the experiences he had had of
late, and formerly, of God's goodness to him, which he mentions to the
glory of God; he that has delivered doth and will. 1. God had taken
notice of his afflictions and all the circumstances of them: "Thou hast
considered my trouble, with wisdom to suit relief to it, with
condescension and compassion regarding the low estate of they servant."
2. He had observed the temper of his spirit and the workings of his
heart under his afflictions: "Thou hast known my soul in adversities,
with a tender concern and care for it." God's eye is upon our souls when
we are in trouble, to see whether they be humbled for sin, submissive to
the will of God, and bettered by the affliction. If the soul, when cast
down under affliction, has been lifted up to him in true devotion, he
knows it. 3. He had rescued him out of the hands of Saul when he had him
safe enough in Keilah ([Sa1 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#007).md):
"Thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy, but set me at
liberty, in a large room, where I may shift for my own safety," [Psa
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#008.md). Christ's using those words ([Psa
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#005).md) upon the cross may warrant us to
apply all this to Christ, who trusted in his Father and was supported
and delivered by him, and (because he humbled himself) highly exalted,
which it is proper to think of when we sing these verses, as also
therein to acknowledge the experience we have had of God's gracious
presence with us in our troubles and to encourage ourselves to trust in
him for the future.

[Psalms 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 31:9</span></span>

In the foregoing verses David had appealed to God's righteousness, and
pleaded his relation to him and dependence on him; here he appeals to
his mercy, and pleads the greatness of his own misery, which made his
case the proper object of that mercy. Observe,

I. The complaint he makes of his trouble and distress ([Psa
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#009).md): "Have mercy upon me, O Lord!
for I am in trouble, and need thy mercy." The remembrance he makes of
his condition is not much unlike some even of Job's complaints. 1. His
troubles had fixed a very deep impression upon his mind and made him a
man of sorrows. So great was his grief that his very soul was consumed
with it, and his life spent with it, and he was continually sighing,
[Psa 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#009.md), [Psa
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#010.md). Herein he was a type of Christ,
- who was intimately acquainted with grief and often in tears. We may
guess by David's complexion, which was ruddy and sanguine, by his genius
for music, and by his daring enterprises in his early days, that his
natural disposition was both cheerful and firm, that he was apt to be
cheerful, and not to lay trouble to his heart; yet here we see what he
is brought to: he has almost wept out his eyes, and sighed away his
breath. Let those that are airy and gay take heed of running into
extremes, and never set sorrow at defiance; God can find out ways to
make them melancholy if they will not otherwise learn to be serious. 2.
His body was afflicted with the sorrows of his mind ([Psa
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#010).md): My strength fails, my bones
are consumed, and all because of my iniquity. As to Saul, and the
quarrel he had with him, he could confidently insist upon his
righteousness; but, as it was an affliction God laid upon him, he owns
he had deserved it, and freely confesses his iniquity to have been the
procuring cause of all his trouble; and the sense of sin touched him to
the quick and wasted him more than all his calamities. 3. His friends
were unkind and became shy of him. He was a fear to his acquaintance,
when they saw him they fled from him, [Psa
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#011.md). They durst not harbour him nor
give him any assistance, durst not show him any countenance, nor so much
as be seen in his company, for fear of being brought into trouble by it,
now that Saul had proclaimed him a traitor and outlawed him. They saw
how dearly Ahimelech the priest had paid for aiding and abetting him,
though ignorantly; and therefore, though they could not but own he had a
great deal of wrong done him, yet they had not the courage to appear for
him. He was forgotten by them, as a dead man out of mind ([Psa
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#012).md), and looked upon with contempt
as a broken vessel. Those that showed him all possible respect when he
was in honour at court, now that he had fallen into disgrace, though
unjustly, were strange to him. Such swallow-friends the world is full
of, that are gone in winter. Let those that fall on the losing side not
think it strange if they be thus deserted, but make sure a friend in
heaven, that will not fail them, and make use of him. 4. His enemies
were unjust in their censures of him. They would not have persecuted him
as they did if they had not first represented him as a bad man; he was a
reproach among all his enemies, but especially among his neighbours,
[Psa 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#011.md). Those that had been the
witnesses of his integrity, and could not but be convinced in their
consciences that he was an honest man, were the most forward to
represent him quite otherwise, that they might curry favour with Saul.
Thus he heard the slander of many; every one had a stone to throw at
him, because fear was in every side; that is, they durst not do
otherwise, for he that would not join with his neighbours to accuse
David was looked upon as disaffected to Saul. Thus the best of men have
been represented under the worst characters by those that resolved to
give them the worst treatment. 5. His life was aimed at and he went in
continual peril of it. Fear was on every side, and he knew that,
whatever counsel his enemies took against him, the design was not to
take away his liberty, but to take away his life ([Psa
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#013).md), a life so valuable, so useful,
to the good services of which all Israel owed so much, and which was
never forfeited. Thus, in all the plots of the Pharisees and Herodians
against Christ, still the design was to take away his life, such are the
enmity and cruelty of the serpent's seed.

II\. His confidence in God in the midst of these troubles. Every thing
looked black and dismal round about him, and threatened to drive him to
despair: "But I trusted in thee, O Lord! ([Psa
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#014).md) and was thereby kept from
sinking." His enemies robbed him of his reputation among men, but they
could not rob him of his comfort in God, because they could not drive
him from his confidence in God. Two things he comforted himself with in
his straits, and he went to God and pleaded them with him: - 1. "Thou
art my God; I have chosen thee for mine, and thou hast promised to be
mine;" and, if he be ours and we can by faith call him so, it is enough,
when we can call nothing else ours. "Thou art my God; and therefore to
whom shall I go for relief but to thee?" Those need not be straitened in
their prayers who can plead this; for, if God undertake to be our God,
he will do that for us which will answer the compass and vast extent of
the engagement. 2. My times are in thy hand. Join this with the former
and it makes the comfort complete. If God have our times in his hand, he
can help us; and, if he be our God, he will help us; and then what can
discourage us? It is a great support to those who have God for their God
that their times are in his hand and he will be sure to order and
dispose of them for the best, to all those who commit their spirits also
into his hand, to suit them to their times, as David here, [Psa
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#005.md). The time of life is in God's
hands, to lengthen or shorten, embitter or sweeten, as he pleases,
according to the counsel of his will. Our times (all events that concern
us, and the timing of them) are at God's disposal; they are not in our
own hands, for the way of man is not in himself, not in our friends'
hands, nor in our enemies' hands, but in God's; every man's judgment
proceedeth from him. David does not, in his prayers, prescribe to God,
but subscribe to him. "Lord, my times are in thy hand, and I am well
pleased that they are so; they could not be in a better hand. Thy will
be done."

III\. His petitions to God, in this faith and confidence, 1. He prays
that God would deliver him out of the hand of his enemies ([Psa
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#015).md), and save him ([Psa
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#016).md), and this for his mercies'
sake, and not for any merit of his own. Our opportunities are in God's
hand (so some read it), and therefore he knows how to choose the best
and fittest time for our deliverance, and we must be willing to wait
that time. When David had Saul at his mercy in the cave those about him
said, "This is the time in which God will deliver thee," [Sa1
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#004.md). "No," says David, "the time has
not come for my deliverance till it can be wrought without sin; and I
will wait for that time; for it is God's time, and that is the best
time." 2. That God would give him the comfort of his favour in the mean
time ([Psa 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#016).md): "Make they face to
shine upon thy servant; let me have the comfortable tokens and evidences
of thy favour to me, and that shall put gladness in my heart in the
midst of all my griefs." 3. That his prayers to God might be answered
and his hopes in God accomplished ([Psa
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#017).md): "Let me not be ashamed of my
hopes and prayers, for I have called upon thee, who never saidst to thy
people, Seek in vain, and hope in vain." 4. That shame and silence might
be the portion of wicked people, and particularly of his enemies. They
were confident of their success against David, and that they should run
him down and ruin him. "Lord," says he, "let them be made ashamed of
that confidence by the disappointment of their expectations," as those
that opposed the building of the wall about Jerusalem, when it was
finished, were much cast down in their own eye, [Neh
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#016.md). Let them be silent in the grave.
Note, Death will silence the rage and clamour of cruel persecutors, whom
reason would not silence. In the grave the wicked cease from troubling.
Particularly, he prays for (that is, he prophesies) the silencing of
those that reproach and calumniate the people of God ( [Psa
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#018).md): Let lying lips be put to
silence, that speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against
the righteous. This is a very good prayer which, (1.) We have often
occasion to put up to God; for those that set their mouth against the
heavens commonly revile the heirs of heaven. Religion, in the strict and
serious professors of it, are every where spoken against, \[1.\] With a
great deal of malice: They speak grievous things, on purpose to vex
them, and hoping, with what they say, to do them a real mischief. They
speak hard things (so the word is), which bear hard upon them, and by
which they hope to fasten indelible characters of infamy upon them.
\[2.\] With a great deal of falsehood: They are lying lips, taught by
the father of lies and serving his interest. \[3.\] With a great deal of
scorn and disdain: They speak proudly and contemptuously, as if the
righteous, whom God has honoured, were the most despicable people in the
world, and not worthy to be set with the dogs of their flock. One would
think they thought it no sin to tell a deliberate lie if it might but
serve to expose a good man either to hatred or contempt. Hear, O our
God! for we are despised. (2.) We may pray in faith; for these lying
lips shall be put to silence. God has many ways of doing it. Sometimes
he convinces the consciences of those that reproach his people, and
turns their hearts. Sometimes by his providence he visibly confutes
their calumnies, and brings forth the righteousness of his people as the
light. However, there is a day coming when God will convince ungodly
sinners of the falsehood of all the hard speeches that have spoken
against his people and will execute judgment upon them, [Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014.md), [Jde
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#015.md). Then shall this prayer be fully
answered, and to that day we should have an eye in the singing of it,
engaging ourselves likewise by well-doing, if possible, to silence the
ignorance of foolish men, [Pe1 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#015.md).

[Psalms 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 31:19</span></span>

We have three things in these verses: -

I. The believing acknowledgment which David makes of God's goodness to
his people in general, [Psa 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#019.md),
[Psa 31:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#020.md).

1\. God is good to all, but he is, in a special manner, good to Israel.
His goodness to them is wonderful, and will be, to eternity, matter of
admiration: O how great is thy goodness! How profound are the counsels
of it! how rich are the treasures of it! how free and extensive are the
communications of it! Those very persons whom men load with slanders God
loads with benefits and honours. Those who are interested in this
goodness are described to be such as fear God and trust in him, as stand
in awe of his greatness and rely on his grace. This goodness is said to
be laid up for them and wrought for them. (1.) There is a goodness laid
up for them in the other world, an inheritance reserved in heaven ([Pe1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004).md), and there is a goodness wrought
for them in this world, goodness wrought in them. There is enough in
God's goodness both for the portion and inheritance of all his children
when they come to their full age, and for their maintenance and
education during their minority. There is enough in bank and enough in
hand. (2.) This goodness is laid up in his promise for all that fear
God, to whom assurance is given that they shall want no good thing. But
it is wrought, in the actual performance of the promise, for those that
trust in him - that by faith take hold of the promise, put it in suit,
and draw out to themselves the benefit and comfort of it. If what is
laid up for us in the treasures of the everlasting covenant be not
wrought for us, it is our own fault, because we do not believe. But
those that trust in God, as they have the comfort of his goodness in
their own bosoms, so they have the credit of it (and the credit of an
estate goes far with some); it is wrought for them before the sons of
men. God's goodness to them puts an honour upon them and rolls away
their reproach; for all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they
are the seed which the Lord hath blessed, [Isa
61:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#009.md).

2\. God preserves man and beast; but he is, in a special manner, the
protector of his own people ([Psa
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#020).md): Thou shalt hide them. As his
goodness is hid and reserved for them, so they are hid and preserved for
it. The saints are God's hidden ones. See here, (1.) The danger they are
in, which arises from the pride of man and from the strife of tongues;
proud men insult over them and would trample on them and tread them
down; contentious men pick quarrels with them; and, when tongues are at
strife, good people often go by the worst. The pride of men endangers
their liberty; the strife of tongues in perverse disputings endangers
truth. But, (2.) See the defence they are under: Thou shalt hide them in
the secret of thy presence, in a pavilion. God's providence shall keep
them safe form the malice of their enemies. He has many ways of
sheltering them. When Baruch and Jeremiah were sought for the Lord hid
them, [Jer 36:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#026.md). God's grace shall
keep them safe from the evil of the judgments that are abroad; to them
they have no sting; and they shall hidden in the day of the Lord's
anger, for there is no anger at them. His comforts shall keep them easy
and cheerful; his sanctuary, where they have communion with him,
shelters then from the fiery darts of terror and temptation; and the
mansions in his house above shall be shortly, shall be eternally, their
hiding-place from all danger and fear.

II\. The thankful returns which David makes for God's goodness to him in
particular, [Psa 31:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#021.md), [Psa
31:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#022.md). Having admired God's goodness
to all the saints, he here owns how good he had found him. 1. Without
were fightings; but God had wonderfully preserved his life: "He has
shown me his marvellous loving-kindness, he has given me an instance of
his care for me and favour to me, beyond what I could have expected."
God's loving-kindness to his people, all things considered, is
wonderful; but some instances of it, even in this world, are in a
special manner marvelous in their eyes; as this here, when God preserved
David from the sword of Saul, in caves and woods, as safe as if he had
been in a strong city. In Keilah, that strong city, God showed him great
mercy, both in making him an instrument to rescue the inhabitants out of
the hands of the Philistines and then in rescuing him from the same men
who would have ungratefully delivered him up into the hand of Saul, [Sa1
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#005.md), [Sa1
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#012.md). This was marvellous
loving-kindness indeed, upon which he writes, with wonder and
thankfulness, Blessed be the Lord. Special preservations call for
particular thanksgivings. 2. Within were fears; but God was better to
him than his fears, [Psa 31:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#022.md). He
here keeps an account, (1.) Of his own folly, in distrusting God, which
he acknowledges, to his shame. Though he had express promises to build
upon, and great experience of God's care concerning him in many straits,
yet he had entertained this hard and jealous thought of God, and could
not forbear telling it him to his face. "I am cut off before thy eyes;
thou hast quite forsaken me, and I must not expect to be looked upon or
regarded by thee any more. I shall one day perish by the hand of Saul,
and so be cut off before thy eyes, be ruined while thou lookest on,"
[Sa1 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#001.md). This he said in his flight
(so some read it), which denotes the distress of his affairs. Saul was
just at his back, and ready to seize him, which made the temptation
strong. In my haste (so we read it), which denotes the disturbance and
discomposure of his mind, which made the temptation surprising, so that
it found him off his guard. Note, It is a common thing to speak amiss
when we speak in haste and without consideration; but what we speak
amiss in haste we must repent of at leisure, particularly that which we
have spoken distrustfully of God. (2.) Of God's wonderful goodness to
him notwithstanding. Though his faith failed, God's promise did not:
Thou hearest the voice of my supplication, for all this. He mentions his
own unbelief as a foil to God's fidelity, serving to make his
loving-kindness the more marvellous, the more illustrious. When we have
thus distrusted God he might justly take us at our word, and bring our
fears upon us, as he did on Israel, [Num
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#028.md); [Isa
66:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#004.md). But he has pitied and pardoned
us, and our unbelief has not made his promise and grace of no effect;
for he knows our frame.

III\. The exhortation and encouragement which he hereupon gives to all
the saints, [Psa 31:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#023.md), [Psa
31:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#024.md). 1. He would have them set their
love on God ([Psa 31:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#023).md): O love the
Lord! all you his saints. Those that have their own hearts full of love
to God cannot but desire that others also may be in love with him; for
in his favour there is no need to fear a rival. It is the character of
the saints that they do love God; and yet they must still be called upon
to love him, to love him more and love him better, and give proofs of
their love. We must love him, not only for his goodness, because he
preserves the faithful, but for his justice, because he plentifully
rewards the proud doer (who would ruin those whom he preserves),
according to their pride. Some take it in a good sense; he plentifully
rewards the magnificent (or excellent) doer, that is daringly good,
whose heart, like Jehoshaphat's, is lifted up in the ways of the Lord.
He rewards him that does well, but plentifully rewards him that does
excellently well. 2. He would have them set their hope in God ([Psa
31:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#024).md): "Be of good courage; have a
good heart on it; whatever difficulties or dangers you may meet with,
the God you trust in shall by that trust strengthen your heart." Those
that hope in God have reason to be of good courage, and let their hearts
be strong, for, as nothing truly evil can befal them, so nothing truly
good for them shall be wanting to them.

In singing this we should animate ourselves and one another to proceed
and persevere in our Christian course, whatever threatens us, and
whoever frowns upon us.
