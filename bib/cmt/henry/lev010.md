### [Leviticus Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 10:0</span></span>

The story of this chapter is as sad an interruption to the institutions
of the levitical law as that of the golden calf was to the account of
the erecting of the tabernacle. Here is, I. The sin and death of Nadab
and Abihu, the sons of Aaron ([Lev
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001.md), [Lev
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#002).md). II. The quieting of Aaron under
this sore affliction ([Lev 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003).md). III.
Orders given and observed about the funeral and mourning ([Lev
10:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#004).md). IV. A command to the priests
not to drink wine when they went in to minister ([Lev
10:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#008).md). V. The care Moses took that
they should go on with their work, notwithstanding the agitation
produced by this event ([Lev 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#012.md),
etc.).

[Leviticus 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 10:1</span></span>

Here is, I. The great sin that Nadab and Abihu were guilty of: and a
great sin we must call it, how little soever it appears in our eye,
because it is evident by the punishment of it that it was highly
provoking to the God of heaven, whose judgment, we are sure, is
according to truth. But what was their sin? All the account here given
of it is that they offered strange fire before the Lord, which he
commanded them not ([Lev 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001).md), and
the same [Num 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#004.md). 1. It does not
appear the they had any orders to burn incense at all at this time. It
is true their consecration was completed the day before, and it was part
of their work, as priests, to serve at the altar of incense; but, it
should seem, the whole service of this solemn day of inauguration was to
be performed by Aaron himself, for he slew the sacrifices ([Lev
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#008.md), [Lev
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#015.md), [Lev
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#018).md), and his sons were only to
attend him ([Lev 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#009.md), [Lev
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#012.md), [Lev
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#018).md); therefore Moses and Aaron only
went into the tabernacle, v. 23. But Nadab and Abihu were so proud of
the honour they were newly advanced to, and so ambitious of doing the
highest and most honourable part of their work immediately, that though
the service of this day was extraordinary, and done by particular
direction from Moses, yet without receiving orders, or so much as asking
leave from him, they took their censers, and they would enter into the
tabernacle, at the door of which they thought they had attended long
enough, and would burn incense. And then their offering strange fire is
the same with offering strange incense, which is expressly forbidden,
[Exo 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#009.md). Moses, we may suppose, had
the custody of the incense which was prepared for this purpose ([Exo
39:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#038).md), and they, doing this without
his leave, had none of the incense which should have been offered, but
common incense, so that the smoke of their incense came from a strange
fire. God had indeed required the priests to burn incense, but, at this
time, it was what he commanded them not; and so their crime was like
that of Uzziah the king, [Ch2 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016.md).
The priests were to burn incense only when it was their lot ([Luk
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#009).md), and, at this time, it was not
theirs. 2. Presuming thus to burn incense of their own without order, no
marvel that they made a further blunder, and instead of taking of the
fire from the altar, which was newly kindled from before the Lord and
which henceforward must be used in offering both sacrifice and incense
([Rev 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#005).md), they took common fire,
probably from that with which the flesh of the peace-offerings was
boiled, and this they made use of in burning incense; not being holy
fire, it is called strange fire; and, though not expressly forbidden, it
was crime enough that God commanded it not. For (as bishop Hall well
observes here) "It is a dangerous thing, in the service of God, to
decline from his own institutions; we have to do with a God who is wise
to prescribe his own worship, just to require what he has prescribed,
and powerful to revenge what he has not prescribed." 3. Incense was
always to be burned by only one priest at a time, but here they would
both go in together to do it. 4. They did it rashly, and with
precipitation. They snatched their censers, so some read it, in a light
careless way, without due reverence and seriousness: when all the people
fell upon their faces, before the glory of the Lord, they thought the
dignity of their office was such as to exempt them from such abasements.
The familiarity they were admitted to bred a contempt of the divine
Majesty; and now that they were priests they thought they might do what
they pleased. 5. There is reason to suspect that they were drunk when
they did it, because of the law which was given upon this occasion, [Lev
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#008.md). They had been feasting upon the
peace-offerings, and the drink-offerings that attended them, and so
their heads were light, or, at least, their hearts were merry with wine;
they drank and forgot the law ([Pro
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#005).md) and were guilty of this fatal
miscarriage. 6. No doubt it was done presumptuously; for, if it had been
done through ignorance, they would have been allowed the benefit of the
law lately made, even for the priests, that they should bring a
sin-offering, [Lev 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002.md), [Lev
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#003.md). But the soul that doth aught
presumptuously, and in contempt of God's majesty, authority, and
justice, that soul shall be cut of, [Num
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#030.md).

II\. The dreadful punishment of this sin: There went out fire from the
Lord, and devoured them, [Lev 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#002.md).
This fire which consumed the sacrifices came the same way with that
which had consumed the sacrifices ([Lev
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024).md), which showed what justice would
have done to all the guilty people if infinite mercy had not found and
accepted a ransom; and, if that fire struck such an awe upon the people,
much more would this.

1\. Observe the severity of their punishment. (1.) They died. Might it
not have sufficed if they had been only struck with a leprosy, as
Uzziah, or struck dumb, as Zechariah, and both by the altar of incense?
No; they were both struck dead. The wages of this sin was death. (2.)
They died suddenly, in the very act of their sin, and had not time so
much as to cry, "Lord, have mercy upon us!" Though God is long-suffering
to us-ward, yet sometimes he makes quick work with sinners; sentence is
executed speedily: presumptuous sinners bring upon themselves a swift
destruction, and are justly denied even space to repent. (3.) They died
before the Lord; that is, before the veil that covered the mercy-seat;
for even mercy itself will not suffer its own glory to be affronted.
Those that sinned before the Lord died before him. Damned sinners are
said to be tormented in the presence of the Lamb, intimating that he
does not interpose on their behalf, [Rev
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#010). (4..md) They died by fire, as by
fire they sinned. They slighted the fire that came from before the Lord
to consume the sacrifices, and thought other fire would do every jot as
well; and now God justly made them feel the power of that fire which
they did not reverence. Thus those that hate to be refined by the fire
of divine grace will undoubtedly be ruined by the fire of divine wrath.
The fire did not burn them to ashes, as it had done the sacrifices, nor
so much as singe their coats ([Lev
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#005).md), but, like lightning, struck
them dead in an instant; by these different effects of the same fire God
would show that it was no common fire, but kindled by the breath of the
Almighty, [Isa 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#023). (5..md) It is twice
taken notice of in scripture that they died childless, [Num
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#004.md), and [Ch1
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#002.md). By their presumption they had
reproached God's name, and God justly blotted out their names, and laid
that honour in the dust which they were proud of.

2\. But why did the Lord deal thus severely with them? Were they not the
sons of Aaron, the saint of the Lord, nephews to Moses, the great
favourite of heaven? Was not the holy anointing oil sprinkled upon them,
as men whom God had set apart for himself? Had they not diligently
attended during the seven days of their consecration, and kept the
charge of the Lord, and might not that atone for this rashness? Would it
not excuse them that they were young men, as yet unexperienced in these
services, that it was the first offence, and done in a transport of joy
for their elevation? And besides, never could men be worse spared: a
great deal of work was now lately cut out for the priests to do, and the
priesthood was confined to Aaron and his seed; he has but four sons; if
two of them die, there will not be hands enough to do the service of the
tabernacle; if they die childless, the house of Aaron will become weak
and little, and the priesthood will be in danger of being lost for want
of heirs. But none of all these considerations shall serve either to
excuse the offence or bring off the offenders. For, (1.) The sin was
greatly aggravated. It was a manifest contempt of Moses, and the divine
law that was given by Moses. Hitherto it had been expressly observed
concerning every thing that was done that they did it as the Lord
commanded Moses, in opposition to which it is here said they did that
which the Lord commanded them not, but they did it of their own heads.
God was now teaching his people obedience, and to do every thing by
rule, as becomes servants; for priests therefore to break rules and
disobey was such a provocation as must by no means go unpunished. Their
character made their sin more exceedingly sinful. For the sons of Aaron,
his eldest sons, whom God had chosen to be immediate attendants upon
him, for them to be guilty of such a piece of presumption, it cannot be
suffered. There was in their sin a contempt of God's glory, which had
now newly appeared in fire, as if that fire were needless, they had as
good of their own before. (2.) Their punishment was a piece of necessary
justice, now at the first settling of the ceremonial institutions. It is
often threatened in the law that such and such offenders should be cut
off from the people; and here God explained the threatening with a
witness. Now that the laws concerning sacrifices were newly made, lest
any should be tempted to think lightly of them because they descended to
many circumstances which seemed very minute, these that were the first
transgressors were thus punished, for warning to others, and to show how
jealous God is in the matters of his worship. Thus he magnified the law
and made it honourable; and let his priests know that the caution which
so often occurs in the laws concerning them, that they must do so that
they die not, was not a mere bugbear, but fair warning of their danger,
if they did the work of the Lord negligently. And no doubt this
exemplary piece of justice at first prevented many irregularities
afterwards. Thus Ananias and Sapphira were punished, when they presumed
to lie to the Holy Ghost, that newly-descended fire. (3.) As the
people's falling into idolatry, presently after the moral law was given,
shows the weakness of the law and its insufficiency to take away sin, so
the sin and punishment of these priests show the imperfection of that
priesthood from the very beginning, and its inability to shelter any
from the fire of God's wrath otherwise than as it was typical of
Christ's priesthood, in the execution of which there never was, nor can
be, any irregularity, or false step taken.

[Leviticus 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 10:3</span></span>

We may well think that when Nadab and Abihu were struck with death all
about them were struck with horror, and every face, as well as theirs,
gathered blackness. Great consternation, no doubt, seized them, and they
were all full of confusion; but, whatever the rest were, Moses was
composed, and knew what he said and did, not being displeased, as David
was in a like case, [Sa2 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#008.md). But
though it touched him in a very tender part, and was a dreadful damp to
one of the greatest joys he ever knew, yet he kept possession of his own
soul, and took care to keep good order and a due decorum in the
sanctuary.

I. He endeavours to pacify Aaron, and to keep him in a good frame under
this sad dispensation, [Lev 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003.md).
Moses was a brother that was born for adversity, and has taught us, by
his example, with seasonable counsels and comforts to support the weak,
and strengthen the feeble-minded. Observe here,

1\. What it was that Moses suggested to his poor brother upon this
occasion: This is it that the Lord spoke. Note, The most quieting
considerations under affliction are those that are fetched from the word
of God. So and so the Lord hath said, and it is not for us to gainsay
it. Note, also, In all God's providences it is good to observe the
fulfilling of scripture, and to compare God's word and his works
together, which if we do we shall find an admirable harmony and
agreement between them, and that they mutually explain and illustrate
each other. But, (1.) Where did God speak this? We do not find the very
words; but to this purport he had said ([Exo
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#022).md), Let the priests who come near
to the Lord sanctify themselves, lest the Lord break forth upon them.
Indeed the whole scope and tenour of his law spoke this, that being a
holy God, and a sovereign Lord, he must always be worshipped with
holiness and reverence, and exactly according to his own appointment;
and, if any jest with him, it is at their peril. Much had been said to
this purport, as [Exo 29:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#043.md), [Exo
29:44](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#044.md); [Exo
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#014.md); [Lev
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#035). (2..md) What was it that God spoke?
It was this (the Lord by his grace speak it to all our hearts!) I will
be sanctified in those that come nigh me, whoever they are, and before
all the people I will be glorified. Note, First, Whenever we worship
God, we come nigh unto him, as spiritual priests. This consideration
ought to make us very reverent and serious in all acts of devotion, that
in them we approach to God, and present ourselves before him. Secondly,
It concerns us all, when we come nigh to God, to sanctify him, that is,
to give him the praise of his holiness, to perform every religious
exercise as those who believe that the God with whom we have to do is a
holy God, a God of spotless purity and transcendent perfection, [Isa
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#013.md). Thirdly, When we sanctify God we
glorify him, for his holiness is his glory; and, when we sanctify him in
our solemn assemblies, we glorify him before all the people, confessing
our own belief of his glory and desiring that others also may be
affected with it. Fourthly, If God be not sanctified and glorified by
us, he will be sanctified and glorified upon us. He will take vengeance
on those that profane his sacred name by trifling with him. If his rent
be not paid, it shall be distrained for. (3.) But what was this to the
present case? What was there in this to quiet Aaron? Two things: -
\[1.\] This must silence him, that his sons deserved their death; for
they were thus cut off from their people because they did not sanctify
and glorify God. The acts of necessary justice, how hard soever they may
seem to bear upon the persons concerned, are not to be complained of,
but submitted to. \[2.\] This must satisfy him, that the death of his
sons redounded to the honour of God, and his impartial justice would for
it be adored throughout all ages.

2\. What good effects this had upon him: Aaron held his peace, that is,
he patiently submitted to the holy will of God in this sad providence,
was dumb, and opened not his mouth, because God did it. Something he was
ready to say by way of complaint (as losers think they may have leave to
speak), but he wisely suppressed it, laid his hand upon his mouth, and
said nothing, for fear lest he should offend with his tongue, now that
his heart was hot within him. Note, (1.) When God corrects us or ours
for sin, it is our duty to be silent under the correction, not to
quarrel with God, arraign his justice, or charge him with folly, but to
acquiesce in all that God does; not only bearing, but accepting, the
punishment of iniquity, and saying, as Eli, in a case not much unlike
this, It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good, [Sa1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#018.md). If our children have sinned
against God (as Bildad puts the case, [Job
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#004).md), and he have cast them away for
their transgression, though it must needs be grievous to think that the
children of our love should be the children of God's wrath, yet we must
awfully adore the divine justice, and make no exceptions against its
processes. (2.) The most effectual arguments to quiet a gracious spirit
under afflictions are those that are fetched from God's glory; this
silenced Aaron. It is true he is a loser in his comforts by this severe
execution, but Moses has shown him that God is a gainer in his glory,
and therefore he has not a word to say against it: if God be sanctified,
Aaron is satisfied. Far be it form him that he should honour his sons
more than God, or wish that God's name, or house, or law, should be
exposed to reproach or contempt for the preserving of the reputation of
his family. No; now, as well as in the matter of the golden calf, Levi
does not acknowledge his brethren, nor know his own children; and
therefore they shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law, [Deu
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#009.md), [Deu
33:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#010.md). Ministers and their families
are sometimes exercised with sore trials that they may be examples to
the believers of patience and resignation to God, and they may comfort
others with that with which they themselves have been comforted.

II\. Moses gives orders about the dead bodies. It was not fit that they
should be left to lie where they fell; yet their own father and
brethren, the amazed spectators of this dismal tragedy, durst not offer
to lift them up, no, not to see whether there was any life left in them;
they must neither be diverted from nor unfitted for the great work that
was now upon their hands. Let the dead bury their dead, but they must go
on with their service; that is, "Rather let the dead be unburied, if
there be nobody else to do it, than that work for God should be left
undone by those whom he has called to it." But Moses takes care of this
matter, that though they died by the hand of justice in the act of sin,
yet they should be decently buried, and they were so, [Lev
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#004.md), [Lev
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#005.md). 1. Some of their nearest
relations were employed in it, who were cousins-german to their father,
and are here named, who would perform this office with tenderness and
respect. They were Levites only, and might not have come into the
sanctuary, no, not upon such an occasion as this, if they had not had a
special command for it. 2. They carried them out of the camp to be
burned, so far were they from burying them in the place of worship, or
the court of it, according to our modern usage, though they died there,
that they did not bury them, nor any of their dead, within the lines of
their camp; as afterwards their burying places were out of their cities.
The tabernacle was pitched in the midst of the camp, so that they could
not carry these dead priests to their graves without carrying them
through one of the squadrons of the camp; and doubtless it was a very
awful affecting sight to the people. The names of Nadab and Abihu had
become very great and honourable among them; none more talked of, nor
more expected to appear abroad after the days of their consecration, to
receive the honours and caresses of the crowd, whose manner it is to
adore the rising sun; and next to Moses and Aaron, who were old and
going off, Nadab and Abihu (who had been in the mount with God, [Exo
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#001).md) were looked upon as the great
favourites of heaven, and the hopes of their people; and now on a
sudden, when the tidings of the event had scarcely reached their ears,
to see them both carried out dead, with the visible marks of divine
vengeance upon them, as sacrifices to the justice of God, they could not
choose but cry out, Who is able to stand before this holy Lord God? [Sa1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#020.md). 3. They carried them out (and
probably buried them) in their coats, and the garments of their
priesthood, which they had lately put on, and perhaps were too proud of.
Thus the impartiality of God's justice was proclaimed, and all the
people were made to know that even the priests' garments would not
protect an offender from the wrath of God. And it was easy to argue, "If
they escape not when they transgress, can we expect to go unpunished?"
And the priests' clothes being so soon made grave-clothes might intimate
both that the law worketh death, and that in the process of time that
priesthood itself should be abolished and buried in the grave of the
Lord Jesus.

III\. He gives directions about the mourning.

1\. That the priests must not mourn. Aaron and his two surviving sons,
though sad in spirit, must not use any outward expressions of sorrow
upon this sad occasion, nor so much as follow the corpse one step from
the door of the tabernacle, [Lev 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#007.md).
It was afterwards forbidden to the high priest to use the ceremonies of
mourning for the death of any friend whatsoever, though it were a father
or mother ([Lev 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#011).md); yet it was
allowed at the same time to the inferior priests to mourn for their near
relations, [Lev 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#002.md), [Lev
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003.md). But here it was forbidden both
to Aaron and his sons, because, (1.) They were now actually waiting,
doing a great work, which must by no means cease ([Neh
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#003).md); and it was very much for the
honour of God that their attendance on him should take place of their
respects to their nearest relations, and that all services should give
way to those of their ministry. By this they must make it to appear that
they had a greater value and affection for their God and their work than
for the best friend they had in the world; as Christ did, [Mat
12:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#047.md), [Mat
12:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#048.md). And we are hereby taught, when
we are serving God in holy duties, to keep out minds, as much as may be,
intent and engaged, and not to suffer them to be diverted by any worldly
thoughts, or cares, or passions. Let us always attend upon the Lord
without distraction. (2.) Their brethren were cut off for their
transgression by the immediate hand of God, and therefore they must not
mourn for them lest they should seem to countenance the sin, or impeach
the justice of God in the punishment. Instead of lamenting their own
loss, they must be wholly taken up in applauding the sentence, and
subscribing to the equity of it. Note, The public concerns of God's
glory ought to lie nearer our hearts than any private affections of our
own. Observe, How Moses frightens them into this submission, and holds
the rod over them to still their crying ([Lev
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#006).md): "Lest you die likewise, and
lest wrath come upon all the people, who may be in danger of suffering
for your irreverence, and disobedience, and ungoverned passions;" and
again ([Lev 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#007).md), lest you die. See
here what use we are to make of the judgments of God upon others; we
must double our guard over ourselves, lest we likewise perish. The
death, especially the sudden death, of others, instead of moving our
passion, should compose us into a holy reverence of God, a cautious
separation from all sin, and a serious expectation of our own death. The
reason given them is because the anointing oil of your God is upon you,
the honour of which must be carefully preserved by your doing the duty
of your office with cheerfulness. Note, Those that through grace have
received the anointing ought not to disturb themselves with the sorrow
of the world, which worketh death. It was very hard, no doubt, for Aaron
and his sons to restrain themselves upon such an extraordinary occasion
from inordinate grief, but reason and grace mastered the passion, and
they bore the affliction with an obedient patience: They did according
to the word of Moses, because they knew it to be the word of God. Happy
those who thus are themselves under God's government, and have their
passions under their own government.

2\. The people must mourn: Let the whole house of Israel bewail the
burning which the Lord has kindled. The congregation must lament, not
only the loss of their priests, but especially the displeasure of God
which appeared in it. They must bewail the burning that was kindled,
that it might not burn further. Aaron and his sons were in danger of
being too much affected with the providence, and therefore they are
forbidden to mourn: the house of Israel were in danger of being too
little affected with it, and therefore they are commanded to lament.
Thus nature must always be governed by grace, according as it needs to
be either constrained or restrained.

[Leviticus 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 10:8</span></span>

Aaron having been very observant of what God said to him by Moses, now
God does him the honour to speak to him immediately ([Lev
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#008).md): The Lord spoke unto Aaron, and
the rather because what was now to be said Aaron might perhaps have
taken amiss from Moses, as if he had suspected him to have been a
gluttonous man and a wine-bibber, so apt are we to resent cautions as
accusations; therefore God saith it himself to him, Do not drink wine,
nor strong drink, when you go into the tabernacle, and this at their
peril, lest you die, [Lev 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#009.md).
Probably they had seen the ill effect of it in Nadab and Abihu, and
therefore must take warning by them. Observe here, 1. The prohibition
itself: Do not drink wine nor strong drink. At other times they were
allowed it (it was not expected that every priest should be a Nazarite),
but during the time of their ministration they were forbidden it. This
was one of the laws in Ezekiel's temple ([Eze
44:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#021).md), and so it is required of
gospel ministers that they be not given to wine, [Ti1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#003.md). Note, Drunkenness is bad in any,
but it is especially scandalous and pernicious in ministers, who of all
men ought to have the clearest heads and the cleanest hearts. 2. The
penalty annexed to the prohibition: Lest you die; lest you die when you
are in drink, and so that day come upon you unawares, [Luk
21:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#034.md). Or, "Lest you do that which
will make you liable to be cut off by the hand of God." The danger of
death we are continually in should engage us to be sober, [Pe1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#007.md). It is a pity that it should ever
be used for the support of licentiousness, as it is by those who argue,
Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die. 3. The reasons assigned for
this prohibition. They must needs to be sober, else they could not duly
discharge their office; they will be in danger of erring through wine,
[Isa 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#007.md). They must be sure to keep
sober, (1.) That they might themselves be able to distinguish, in their
ministrations, between that which was sacred and that which was common,
and might never confound them, [Lev
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#010.md). It concerns the Lord's
ministers to put a difference between holy and unholy, both things and
persons, that they may separate between the precious and the vile, [Jer
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#019). (2..md) That they might be able to
teach the people ([Lev 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#011).md), for
that was a part of the priests' work ([Deu
33:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#010).md); and those that are addicted to
drunkenness are very unfit to teach people God's statutes, both because
those that live after the flesh can have no experimental acquaintance
with the things of the Spirit, and because such teachers pull down with
one hand what they build up with the other.

[Leviticus 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 10:12</span></span>

Moses is here directing Aaron to go on with his service after this
interruption. Afflictions should rather quicken us to our duty than take
us off from it. Observe ([Lev 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#012).md),
He spoke unto Aaron and to his sons that were left. The notice taken of
their survivorship intimates, 1. That Aaron should take comfort under
the loss of two of his sons, from this consideration, that God had
graciously spared him the other two, and that he had reason to be
thankful for the remnant that was left, and all his sons were not dead,
and, in token of his thankfulness to God, to go on cheerfully in his
work. 2. That God's sparing them should be an engagement upon them to
proceed in his service, and not to fly off from it. Here were four
priests consecrated together, two were taken away, and two left;
therefore the two that were left should endeavour to fill up the places
of those that were gone, by double care and diligence in the services of
the priesthood. Now,

I. Moses repeats the directions he had formerly given them about eating
their share of the sacrifices, [Lev
10:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#012.md), [Lev
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#015.md). The priests must learn not only
to put a difference between the holy and the unholy, as they had been
taught ([Lev 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#010).md), but also to
distinguish between that which was most holy and that which was only
holy of the things that were to eat. That part of the meat-offering
which remained to the priest was most holy, and therefore must be eaten
in the courts of the tabernacle, and by Aaron sons only ([Lev
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#012.md), [Lev
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#013).md); but the breast and shoulder of
the peace-offerings might be eaten in any decent place out of the courts
of the tabernacle, and by the daughters of their families. The
meat-offerings, being annexed to the burnt-offerings, were intended only
and wholly for the glory of God; but the peace-offerings were ordained
for the furtherance of men's joy and comfort; the former therefore were
the more sacred, and to be had more in veneration. This distinction the
priests must carefully observe, and take heed of making any blunders.
Moses does not pretend to give any reasons for this difference, but
refers to his instructions: For so am I commanded, [Lev
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#013.md). This was reason enough; he had
received of the Lord all that he delivered unto them, [Co1
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#023.md).

II\. He enquires concerning one deviation from the appointment, which it
seems had happened upon this occasion, which was this: - There was a
goat to be sacrificed as a sin-offering or the people, [Lev
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#015.md). Now the law of the sin-offerings
was that if the blood of them was brought into the holy place, as that
of the sin-offerings for the priest was, then the flesh was to be burnt
without the camp; otherwise it was to be eaten by the priest in the holy
place, [Lev 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#030.md). The meaning of this
is here explained ([Lev 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#017).md), that
the priests did hereby bear the iniquity of the congregation, that is,
they were types of him who was to be made sin for us, and on whom God
would lay the iniquity of us all. Now the blood of this goat was not
brought into the holy place, and yet, it seems, it was burnt without the
camp. Now observe here, 1. The gentle reproof Moses gives to Aaron and
his sons for this irregularity. Here again Aaron sons are said to be
those that were left alive ([Lev
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#016).md), who therefore ought to have
taken warning; and Moses was angry with them. Though he was the meekest
man in the world, it seems he could be angry; and when he thought God
was disobeyed and dishonoured, and the priesthood endangered, he would
be angry. Yet observe how very mildly he deals with Aaron and his sons,
considering their present affliction. He only tells them they should
indeed have eaten it in the holy place, but is willing to hear what they
have to say for themselves, being loth to speak to the grief of those
whom God had wounded.

2\. The plausible excuse which Aaron makes for this mistake. Moses
charged the fault upon Eleazar and Ithamar ([Lev
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#016).md), but it is probable that what
they did was by Aaron direction, and therefore he apologized for it. He
might have pleaded that this was a sin-offering for the congregation,
and if it had been a bullock it must have been wholly burnt ([Lev
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#021).md), and therefore why not now that
it was a goat? But it seems it was otherwise ordered at this time, and
therefore he makes his affliction his excuse, [Lev
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#019). Observe, (1..md) How he speaks of
affliction: Such things have befallen me, such sad things, which could
not but go near his heart, and make it very happy. He was a high priest
taken from among men, and could not put off natural affection when he
put on the holy garments. He held his peace ([Lev
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003).md), yet his sorrow was stirred, as
David's, [Psa 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#002.md). Note, There may be
a deep sense of affliction even where there is a sincere resignation to
the will of God in the affliction. "Such things as never befel me
before, and as I little expected now. My spirits cannot but sink, when I
see my family sinking; I must needs be heavy, when God is angry:" thus
it is easy to say a great deal to aggravate an affliction, but it is
better to say little. (2.) How he makes this an excuse for his varying
from the appointment about the sin-offering. He could not have eaten it
but in his mourning, and with a sorrowful spirit; and would this have
been accepted? He does not plead that his heart was so full of grief
that he had no appetite for it, but that he feared it would not be
accepted. Note, \[1.\] Acceptance with God is the great thing we should
desire and aim at in all our religious services, particularly in the
Lord's supper, which is our eating of the sin-offering. \[2.\] The
sorrow of the world is a very great hindrance to our acceptable
performance of holy duties, both as it is discomposing to ourselves,
takes off our chariot-wheels and makes us drive heavily ([Sa1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#007.md), [Sa1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#008).md), and as it is displeasing to God,
whose will it is that we should serve him cheerfully, [Deu
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#007.md). Mourner's bread was polluted,
[Hos 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#004.md). See [Mal
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#014.md).

3\. The acquiescence of Moses in this excuse: He was content, [Lev
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#020.md). Perhaps he thought it justified
what they had done. God had provided that what could not be eaten might
be burnt. Our unfitness for duty, when it is natural and not sinful,
will have great allowances made for it; and God will have mercy and not
sacrifice. At least he thought it did very much extenuate the fault; the
spirit indeed was willing, but the flesh was weak. God by Moses showed
that he considered his frame. It appeared that Aaron sincerely aimed at
God's acceptance; and those that do so with an upright heart shall find
he is not extreme to mark what they do amiss. Nor must we be severe in
our animadversions upon every mistake, considering ourselves, lest we
also be tempted.
