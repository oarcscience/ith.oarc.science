### [Jeremiah Chapter 47](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 47:0</span></span>

This chapter reads the Philistines their doom, as the former read the
Egyptians theirs and by the same hand, that of Nebuchadnezzar. It is
short, but terrible; and Tyre and Zidon, though they lay at some
distance from them, come in sharers with them in the destruction here
threatened. I. It is foretold that the forces of the northern crowns
should come upon them, to their great terror ([Jer
47:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001).md). II. That the war should
continue long, and their endeavours to put an end to it should be in
vain ([Jer 47:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#006).md).

[Jeremiah 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001.md)

As the Egyptians had often proved false friends, so the Philistines had
always been sworn enemies, to the Israel of God, and the more dangerous
and vexatious for their being such near neighbours to them. They were
considerably humbled in David's time, but, it seems they had got head
again and were a considerable people till Nebuchadnezzar cut them off
with their neighbours, which is the event here foretold. The date of
this prophecy is observable; it was before Pharaoh smote Gaza. When this
blow was given to Gaza by the king of Egypt is not certain, whether in
his expedition against Carchemish or in his return thence, after he had
slain Josiah, or when he afterwards came with design to relieve
Jerusalem; but this is mentioned here to show that this word of the Lord
came to Jeremiah against the Philistines when they were in their full
strength and lustre, themselves and their cities in good condition, in
no peril from any adversary or evil occurrent. When no disturbance of
their repose was foreseen by any human probabilities, yet then Jeremiah
foretold their ruin, which Pharaoh's smiting Gaza soon after would be
but an earnest of, and, as it were, the beginning of sorrows to that
country. It is here foretold, 1. That a foreign enemy and a very
formidable one shall be brought upon them: Waters rise up out of the
north, [Jer 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#002.md). Waters sometimes
signify multitudes of people and nations ([Rev
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#015).md), sometimes great and
threatening calamities ([Psa 69:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001).md);
here they signify both. They rise out of the north, whence fair weather
and the wind that drives away rain are said to come; but now a terrible
storm comes out of that cold climate. The Chaldean army shall overflow
the land like a deluge. Probably this happened before the destruction of
Jerusalem, for it should seem that in Gedaliah's time, which was just
after, the army of the Chaldeans was quite withdrawn out of those parts.
The country of the Philistines was but of small extent, so that it would
soon be overwhelmed by so vast an army. 2. That they shall all be in a
consternation upon it. The men shall have no heart to fight, but shall
sit down and cry like children: All the inhabitants of the land shall
howl, so that nothing but lamentation shall be heard in all places. The
occasion of the fright is elegantly described, [Jer
47:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#003.md). Before it comes to killing and
slaying, the very stamping of the horses and rattling of the chariots,
when the enemy makes his approach, shall strike a terror upon the
people, to such a degree that parents in their fright shall seem void of
natural affection, for they shall not look back to their children, to
provide for their safety, or so much as to see what becomes of them.
Their hands shall be so feeble that they shall despair of carrying them
off with them, and therefore they shall not care for seeing them, but
leave them to take their lot; or they shall be in such a consternation
that they shall quite forget even those pieces of themselves. Let none
be over-fond of their children, nor dote upon them, since such distress
may come that they may either wish they had none or forget that they
have, and have no heart to look upon them. 3. That the country of the
Philistines shall be spoiled and laid waste, and the other countries
adjoining to them and in alliance with them. It is a day to spoil the
Philistines, for the Lord will spoil them, [Jer
47:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#004.md). Note, Those whom God will spoil
must needs be spoiled; for, if God be against them, who can be for them?
Tyre and Zidon were strong and wealthy cities, and they used to help the
Philistines in a strait, but now they shall themselves be involved in
the common ruin, and God will cut off from them every helper that
remains. Note, Those that trust to help from creatures will find it cut
off when they most need it and will thereby be put into the utmost
confusion. Who the remnant of the country of Caphtor were is uncertain,
but we find that the Caphtorim were near akin to the Philistines ([Gen
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#014).md), and probably when their own
country was destroyed such as remained came and settled with their
kinsmen the Philistines, and were now spoiled with them. Some particular
places are here named, Gaza, and Ashkelon, [Jer
47:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#005.md). Baldness has come upon them; the
invaders have stripped them of all their ornaments, or they have made
themselves bald in token of extreme grief, and they are cut off, with
the other cities that were in the plain or valley about them. The
products of their fruitful valley shall be spoiled, and made a prey of,
by the conquerors. 4. That these calamities should continue long. The
prophet, in the foresight of this, with his usual tenderness, asks them
first ([Jer 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#005).md), How long will you
cut yourselves, as men in extreme sorrow and anguish do? O how tedious
will the calamity be! not only cutting, but long cutting. But he turns
from the effect to the cause: They cut themselves, for the sword of the
Lord cuts them. And therefore, (1.) He bespeaks that to be still ([Jer
47:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#006).md): O thou sword of the Lord! how
long will it be ere thou be quiet? He begs it would put up itself into
the scabbard, would devour no more flesh, drink no more blood. This
expresses the prophet's earnest desire to see an end of the war, looking
with compassion, as became a man, even upon the Philistines themselves,
when their country was made desolate by the sword. Note, War is the
sword of the Lord; with it he punishes the crimes of his enemies and
pleads the cause of his own people. When war is once begun it often
lasts long; the sword, once drawn, does not quickly find the way into
the scabbard again; nay, some when they draw the sword throw away the
scabbard, for they delight in war. So deplorable are the desolations of
war that the blessings of peace cannot but be very desirable. O that
swords might be beaten into ploughshares! (2.) Yet he gives a
satisfactory account of the continuance of the war and stops the mouth
of his own complaint ([Jer 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#007).md): How
can it be quiet, seeing the Lord hath given it a charge against such and
such places, particularly specified in its commission? There hath he
appointed it. Note, \[1.\] The sword of war hath its charge from the
Lord of hosts. Every bullet has its charge; you call them blind bullets,
but they are directed by an all-seeing God. The war itself has its
charge; he saith to it, Go, and it goes - Come, and it comes - Do this,
and it does it; for he is commander-in-chief. \[2.\] When the sword is
drawn we cannot expect it should be sheathed till it has fulfilled its
charge. As the word of God, so his rod and his sword, shall accomplish
that for which he sends them.
