An Exposition, with Practical Observations, of The Book of Job

This book of Job stands by itself, is not connected with any other, and
is therefore to be considered alone. Many copies of the Hebrew Bible
place it after the book of Psalms, and some after the Proverbs, which
perhaps has given occasion to some learned men to imagine it to have
been written by Isaiah or some of the later prophets. But, as the
subject appears to have been much more ancient, so we have no reason to
think but that the composition of the book was, and that therefore it is
most fitly placed first in this collection of divine morals: also, being
doctrinal, it is proper to precede and introduce the book of Psalms,
which is devotional, and the book of Proverbs, which is practical; for
how shall we worship or obey a God whom we know not? As to this book,

I. We are sure that it is given by inspiration of God, though we are not
certain who was the penman of it. The Jews, though no friends to Job,
because he was a stranger to the commonwealth of Israel, yet, as
faithful conservators of the oracles of God committed to them, always
retained this book in their sacred canon. The history is referred to by
one apostle ([Jam 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#011).md) and one
passage ([Job 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#013).md) is quoted by
another apostle, with the usual form of quoting scripture, It is
written, [Co1 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#019.md). It is the opinion
of many of the ancients that this history was written by Moses himself
in Midian, and delivered to his suffering brethren in Egypt, for their
support and comfort under their burdens, and the encouragement of their
hope that God would in due time deliver and enrich them, as he did this
patient sufferer. Some conjecture that it was written originally in
Arabic, and afterwards translated into Hebrew, for the use of the Jewish
church, by Solomon (so Monsieur Jurieu) or some other inspired writer.
It seems most probable to me that Elihu was the penman of it, at least
of the discourses, because ([Job
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#015.md), [Job
32:16](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#016).md) he mingles the words of a
historian with those of a disputant: but Moses perhaps wrote the first
two chapters and the last, to give light to the discourses; for in them
God is frequently called Jehovah, but not once in all the discourses,
except [Job 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#009.md). That name was but
little known to the patriarchs before Moses, [Exo
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003.md). If Job wrote it himself, some of
the Jewish writers themselves own him a prophet among the Gentiles; if
Elihu, we find he had a spirit of prophecy which filled him with matter
and constrained him, [Job 32:18](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#018.md).

II\. We are sure that it is, for the substance of it, a true history,
and not a romance, though the dialogues are poetical. No doubt there was
such a man as Job; the prophet Ezekiel names him with Noah and Daniel,
[Eze 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#014.md). The narrative we have here
of his prosperity and piety, his strange afflictions and exemplary
patience, the substance of his conferences with his friends, and God's
discourse with him out of the whirlwind, with his return at length to a
very prosperous condition, no doubt is exactly true, though the inspired
penman is allowed the usual liberty of putting the matter of which Job
and his friends discoursed into his own words.

III\. We are sure that it is very ancient, though we cannot fix the
precise time either when Job lived or when the book was written. So
many, so evident, are its hoary hairs, the marks of its antiquity, that
we have reason to think it of equal date with the book of Genesis
itself, and that holy Job was contemporary with Isaac and Jacob; though
not coheir with them of the promise of the earthly Canaan, yet a
joint-expectant with them of the better country, that is, the heavenly.
Probably he was of the posterity of Nahor, Abraham's brother, whose
first-born was Uz ([Gen 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#021).md), and in
whose family religion was for some ages kept up, as appears, [Gen
31:53](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#053.md), where God is called, not only
the God of Abraham, but the God of Nahor. He lived before the age of man
was shortened to seventy or eighty, as it was in Moses's time, before
sacrifices were confined to one altar, before the general apostasy of
the nations from the knowledge and worship of the true God, and while
yet there was no other idolatry known than the worship of the sun and
moon, and that punished by the Judges, [Job
31:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026.md). He lived while God was known
by the name of God Almighty more than by the name of Jehovah; for he is
called Shaddai - the Almighty, above thirty times in this book. He lived
while divine knowledge was conveyed, not by writing, but by tradition;
for to that appeals are here made, [Job
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#008.md); [Job
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#029.md); [Job
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#018.md); [Job
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#001.md). And we have therefore reason to
think that he lived before Moses, because here is no mention at all of
the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt, or the giving of the law. There
is indeed one passage which might be made to allude to the drowning of
Pharaoh ([Job 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#012).md): He divideth the
sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through Rahab,
which name Egypt is frequently called by in scripture, as [Psa
87:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md); [Psa
89:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#010.md); [Isa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009.md). But that may as well refer to
the proud waves of the sea. We conclude therefore that we are here got
back to the patriarchal age, and, besides its authority, we receive this
book with veneration for its antiquity.

IV\. We are sure that it is of great use to the church, and to every
good Christian, though there are many passages in it dark and hard to be
understood. We cannot perhaps be confident of the true meaning of every
Arabic word and phrase we meet with in it. It is a book that finds a
great deal of work for the critics; but enough is plain to make the
whole profitable, and it was all written for our learning.

1\. This noble poem presents to us, in very clear and lively characters,
these five things among others: - (1.) A monument of primitive theology.
The first and great principles of the light of nature, on which natural
religion is founded, are here, in a warm, and long, and learned dispute,
not only taken for granted on all sides and not the least doubt made of
them, but by common consent plainly laid down as eternal truths,
illustrated and urged as affecting commanding truths. Were ever the
being of God, his glorious attributes and perfections, his unsearchable
wisdom, his irresistible power, his inconceivable glory, his inflexible
justice, and his incontestable sovereignty, discoursed of with more
clearness, fulness, reverence, and divine eloquence, than in this book?
The creation of the world, and the government of it, are here admirably
described, not as matters of nice speculation, but as laying most
powerful obligations upon us to fear and serve, to submit to and trust
in, our Creator, owner, Lord, and ruler. Moral good and evil, virtue and
vice, were never drawn more to the life (the beauty of the one and the
deformity of the other) than in this book; nor the inviolable rule of
God's judgment more plainly laid down, That happy are the righteous, it
shall be well with them; and Woe to the wicked, it shall be ill with
them. These are not questions of the schools to keep the learned world
in action, nor engines of state to keep the unlearned world in awe; no,
it appears by this book that they are sacred truths of undoubted
certainty, and which all the wise and sober part of mankind have in
every age subscribed and submitted to. (2.) It presents us with a
specimen of Gentile piety. This great saint descended probably not from
Abraham, but Nahor; or, if from Abraham, not from Isaac, but from one of
the sons of the concubines that were sent into the east-country ([Gen
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#006).md); or, if from Isaac, yet not from
Jacob, but Esau; so that he was out of the pale of the covenant of
peculiarity, no Israelite, no proselyte, and yet none like him for
religion, nor such a favourite of heaven upon this earth. It was a truth
therefore, before St. Peter perceived it, that in every nation he that
fears God and works righteousness is accepted of him, [Act
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#035.md). There were children of God
scattered abroad ([Joh 11:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#052).md) besides
the incorporated children of the kingdom, [Mat
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#011.md), [Mat
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#012). (3..md) It presents us with an
exposition of the book of Providence, and a clear and satisfactory
solution of many of the difficult and obscure passages of it. The
prosperity of the wicked and the afflictions of the righteous have
always been reckoned two as hard chapters as any in that book; but they
are here expounded, and reconciled with the divine wisdom, purity, and
goodness, by the end of these things. (4.) It presents us with a great
example of patience and close adherence to God in the midst of the
sorest calamities. Sir Richard Blackmore's most ingenious pen, in his
excellent preface to his paraphrase on this book, makes Job a hero
proper for an epic poem; for, says he, "He appears brave in distress and
valiant in affliction, maintains his virtue, and with that his
character, under the most exasperating provocations that the malice of
hell could invent, and thereby gives a most noble example of passive
fortitude, a character no way inferior to that of the active hero," etc.
(5.) It presents us with an illustrious type of Christ, the particulars
of which we shall endeavour to take notice of as we go along. In
general, Job was a great sufferer, was emptied and humbled, but in order
to his greater glory. So Christ abased himself, that we might be
exalted. The learned bishop Patrick quotes St. Jerome ore than once
speaking of Job as a type of Christ, who for the job that was set before
him endured the cross, who was persecuted, for a time, by men and
devils, and seemed forsaken of God too, but was raised to be an
intercessor even for his friends and had added affliction to his misery.
When the apostle speaks of the patience of Job he immediately takes
notice of the end of the Lord, that is, of the Lord Jesus (as some
understand it), typified by Job, [Jam
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#011.md).

2\. In this book we have, (1.) The history of Job's sufferings, and his
patience under them (ch. 1, [Job
2:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001.md), not without a mixture of human
frailty, ch. 3. (2.) A dispute between him and his friends upon them, in
which, \[1.\] The opponents were Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. \[2.\] The
respondent was Job. \[3.\] The moderators were, First, Elihu, ch. 32-37.
Secondly, God himself, ch. 38-41. (3.) The issue of all in Job's honour
and prosperity, ch. 42. Upon the whole, we learn that many are the
afflictions of the righteous, but that when the Lord delivers them out
of them all the trial of their faith will be found to praise, and
honour, and glory.
