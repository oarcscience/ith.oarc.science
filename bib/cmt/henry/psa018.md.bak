### [Psalms Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 18:0</span></span>

This psalm we met with before, in the history of David's life, 2 Sa. 22.
That was the first edition of it; here we have it revived, altered a
little, and fitted for the service of the church. It is David's
thanksgiving for the many deliverances God had wrought for him; these he
desired always to preserve fresh in his own memory and to diffuse and
entail the knowledge of them. It is an admirable composition. The poetry
is very fine, the images are bold, the expressions lofty, and every word
is proper and significant; but the piety far exceeds the poetry. Holy
faith, and love, and joy, and praise, and hope, are here lively, active,
and upon the wing. I. He triumphs in God ([Psa
18:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001).md). II. He magnifies the
deliverances God had wrought for him (v. 4-19). III. He takes the
comfort of his integrity, which God had thereby cleared up ([Psa
18:20-28](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#020).md). IV. He gives to God the
glory of all his achievements ([Psa
18:29-42](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#029).md). V. He encourages himself
with the expectation of what God would further do for him and his ([Psa
18:43-50](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#043).md).

To the chief musician, A psalm of David, the servant of the Lord, who
spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord
delivered him from the hand of all his enemies.

[Psalms 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 18:1</span></span>

The title gives us the occasion of penning this psalm; we had it before
([Sa2 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#001).md), only here we are told
that the psalm was delivered to the chief musician, or precentor, in the
temple-songs. Note, The private compositions of good men, designed by
them for their own use, may be serviceable to the public, that others
may not only borrow light from their candle, but heat from their fire.
Examples sometimes teach better than rules. And David is here called the
servant of the Lord, as Moses was, not only as every good man is God's
servant, but because, with his sceptre, with his sword, and with his
pen, he greatly promoted the interests of God's kingdom in Israel. It
was more his honour that he was a servant of the Lord than that he was
king of a great kingdom; and so he himself accounted it ([Psa
116:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#016).md): O Lord! truly I am thy
servant. In these verses,

I. He triumphs in God and his relation to him. The first words of the
psalm, I will love thee, O Lord! my strength, are here prefixed as the
scope and contents of the whole. Love to God is the first and great
commandment of the law, because it is the principle of all our
acceptable praise and obedience; and this use we should make of all the
mercies God bestows upon us, our hearts should thereby be enlarged in
love to him. This he requires and will accept; and we are very
ungrateful if we grudge him so poor a return. An interest in the person
loved is the lover's delight; this string therefore he touches, and on
this he harps with much pleasure ([Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002).md): "The Lord Jehovah is my God;
and then he is my rock, my fortress, all that I need and can desire in
my present distress." For there is that in God which is suited to all
the exigencies and occasions of his people that trust in him. "He is my
rock, and strength, and fortress;" that is, 1. "I have found him so in
the greatest dangers and difficulties." 2. "I have chosen him to be so,
disclaiming all others, and depending upon him alone to protect me."
Those that truly love God may thus triumph in him as theirs, and may
with confidence call upon him, [Psa
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003.md). This further use we should make
of our deliverances, we must not only love God the better, but love
prayer the better - call upon him as long as we live, especially in time
of trouble, with an assurance that so we shall be saved; for thus it is
written, Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved,
[Act 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#021.md).

II\. He sets himself to magnify the deliverances God had wrought for
him, that he might be the more affected in his returns of praise. It is
good for us to observe all the circumstances of a mercy, which magnify
the power of God and his goodness to us in it.

1\. The more imminent and threatening the danger was out of which we
were delivered the greater is the mercy of the deliverance. David now
remembered how the forces of his enemies poured in upon him, which he
calls the floods of Belial, shoals of the children of Belial, likely to
overpower him with numbers. They surrounded him, compassed him about;
they surprised him, and by that means were very near seizing him; their
snares prevented him, and, when without were fightings, within were
fears and sorrows, [Psa 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004.md), [Psa
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#005.md). His spirit was overwhelmed, and
he looked upon himself as a lost man; see [Psa
116:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#003.md).

2\. The more earnest we have been with God for deliverance, and the more
direct answer it is to our prayers, the more we are obliged to be
thankful. David's deliverances were so, [Psa
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006.md). David was found a praying man,
and God was found a prayer-hearing God. If we pray as he did, we shall
speed as he did. Though distress drive us to prayer, God will not
therefore be deaf to us; nay, being a God of pity, he will be the more
ready to succour us.

3\. The more wonderful God's appearances are in any deliverance the
greater it is: such were the deliverances wrought for David, in which
God's manifestation of his presence and glorious attributes is most
magnificently described, [Psa 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007.md),
etc. Little appeared of man, but much of God, in these deliverances.
(1.) He appeared a God of almighty power; for he made the earth shake
and tremble, and moved even the foundations of the hills ([Psa
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007).md), as of old at Mount Sinai. When
the men of the earth were struck with fear, then the earth might be said
to tremble; when the great men of the earth were put into confusion,
then the hills moved. (2.) He showed his anger and displeasure against
the enemies and persecutors of his people: He was wroth, [Psa
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007.md). His wrath smoked, it burned, it
was fire, it was devouring fire ([Psa
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008).md), and coals were kindled by it.
Those that by their own sins make themselves as coals (that is, fuel) to
this fire will be consumed by it. He that ordains his arrows against the
persecutors sends them forth when he pleases, and they are sure to hit
the mark and do execution; for those arrows are lightnings, [Psa
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#014). (3..md) He showed his readiness to
plead his people's cause and work deliverance for them; for he rode upon
a cherub and did fly, for the maintaining of right and the relieving of
his distressed servants, [Psa 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010.md).
No opposition, no obstruction, can be given to him who rides upon the
wings of the wind, who rides on the heavens, for the help of his people,
and, in his excellency, on the skies. (4.) He showed his condescension,
in taking cognizance of David's case: He bowed the heavens and came down
([Psa 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#009).md), did not send an angel,
but came himself, as one afflicted in the afflictions of his people.
(5.) He wrapped himself in darkness, and yet commanded light to shine
out of darkness for his people, [Isa
45:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#015.md). He is a God that hideth
himself; for he made darkness his pavilion, [Psa
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011.md). his glory is invisible, his
counsels are unsearchable, and his proceedings unaccountable, and so, as
to us, clouds and darkness are round about him; we know not the way that
he takes, even when he is coming towards us in ways of mercy; but, when
his designs are secret, they are kind; for, though he hide himself, he
is the God of Israel, the Saviour. And, at his brightness, the thick
clouds pass ([Psa 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#012).md), comfort
returns, the face of affairs is changed, and that which was gloomy and
threatening becomes serene and pleasant.

4\. The greater the difficulties are that lie in the way of deliverance
the more glorious the deliverance is. For the rescuing of David, the
waters were to be divided till the very channels were seen; the earth
was to be cloven till the very foundations of it were discovered, [Psa
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#015.md). There were waters deep and
many, waters out of which he was to be drawn ([Psa
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#016).md), as Moses, who had his name
from being drawn out of the water literally, as David was figuratively.
His enemies were strong, and they hated him; had he been left to
himself, they would have been too strong for him, [Psa
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#017.md). And they were too quick for
him; for they prevented him in the day of his calamity, [Psa
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#018.md). But, in the midst of his
troubles, the Lord was his stay, so that he did not sink. Note, God will
not only deliver his people out of their troubles in due time, but he
will sustain them and bear them up under their troubles in the mean
time.

5\. That which especially magnified the deliverance was that his comfort
was the fruit of it and God's favour was the root and fountain of it.
(1.) It was an introduction to his preferment, [Psa
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#019.md). "He brought me forth also out
of my straits into a large place, where I had room, not only to turn,
but to thrive in." (2.) It was a token of God's favour to him, and that
made it doubly sweet: "He delivered me because he delighted in me, not
for my merit, but for his own grace and good-will." Compare this with
[Sa2 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#026.md), If he thus say, I have no
delight in thee, here I am. We owe our salvation, that great
deliverance, to the delight God had in the Son of David, in whom he has
declared himself to be well pleased.

In singing this we must triumph in God, and trust in him: and we may
apply it to Christ the Son of David. The sorrows of death surrounded
him; in his distress he prayed ([Heb
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007).md); God made the earth to shake and
tremble, and the rocks to cleave, and brought him out, in his
resurrection, into a large place, because he delighted in him and in his
undertaking.

[Psalms 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 18:20</span></span>

Here, I. David reflects with comfort upon his own integrity, and
rejoices in the testimony of his conscience that he had had his
conversation in godly sincerity and not with fleshly wisdom, [Co2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012.md). His deliverances were an
evidence of this, and this was the great comfort of his deliverances.
His enemies had misrepresented him, and perhaps, when his troubles
continued long, he began to suspect himself; but, when God visibly took
his part, he had both the credit and the comfort of his righteousness.
1. His deliverances cleared his innocency before men, and acquitted him
from those crimes which he was falsely accused of. This he calls
rewarding him according to his righteousness ([Psa
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#020.md), [Psa
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#024).md), that is, determining the
controversy between him and his enemies, according to the justice of his
cause and the cleanness of his hands, from that sedition, treason, and
rebellion, with which he was charged. He had often appealed to God
concerning his innocency; and now God had given judgment upon the appeal
(as he always will) according to equity. 2. They confirmed the testimony
of his own conscience for him, which he here reviews with a great deal
of pleasure, [Psa 18:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#021.md). His own
heart knows, and is ready to attest it, (1.) That he had kept firmly to
his duty, and had not departed, not wickedly, not wilfully departed,
from his God. Those that forsake the ways of the Lord do, in effect,
depart from their God, and it is a wicked thing to do so. But though we
are conscious to ourselves of many a stumble, and many a false step
taken, yet if we recover ourselves by repentance, and go on in the way
of our duty, it shall not be construed into a departure, for it is not a
wicked departure, from our God. (2.) That he had kept his eye upon the
rule of God's commands ([Psa 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#022).md):
"All his judgments were before me; and I had a respect to them all,
despised none as little, disliked none as hard, but made it my care and
business to conform to them all. His statutes I did not put away from
me, out of my sight, out of my mind, but kept my eye always upon them,
and did not as those who, because they would quit the ways of the Lord,
desire not the knowledge of those ways." (3.) That he had kept himself
from his iniquity, and thereby had approved himself upright before God.
Constant care to abstain from that sin, whatever it be, which most
easily besets us, and to mortify the habit of it, will be a good
evidence for us that we are upright before God. As David's deliverances
cleared his integrity, so did the exaltation of Christ clear his, and
for ever roll away the reproach that was cast upon him; and therefore he
is said to be justified in the Spirit, [Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md).

II\. He takes occasion thence to lay down the rules of God's government
and judgment, that we may know not only what God expects from us, but
what we may expect from him, [Psa
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#025.md), [Psa
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026.md). 1. Those that show mercy to
others (even they need mercy, and cannot depend upon the merit, no, not
of their works of mercy) shall find mercy with God, [Mat
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#007.md). 2. Those that are faithful to
their covenants with God, and the relations wherein they stand to him,
shall find him all that to them which he has promised to be. Wherever
God finds an upright man, he will be found an upright God. 3. Those that
serve God with a pure conscience shall find that the words of the Lord
are pure words, very sure to be depended on and very sweet to be delight
in. 4. Those that resist God, and walk contrary to him, shall find that
he will resist them, and walk contrary to them, [Lev
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#021.md), [Lev
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#024.md).

III\. Hence he speaks comfort to the humble ("Thou wilt save the
afflicted people, that are wronged and bear it patiently"), terror to
the proud ("Thou wilt bring down high looks, that aim high, and look
with scorn and disdain upon the poor and pious"), and encouragement to
himself - "Thou wilt light my candle, that is, thou wilt revive and
comfort my sorrowful spirit, and not leave me melancholy; thou wilt
recover me out of my troubles and restore me to peace and prosperity;
thou wilt make my honour bright, which is now eclipsed; thou wilt guide
my way, and make it plain before me, that I may avoid the snares laid
for me; thou wilt light my candle to work by, and give me an opportunity
of serving thee and the interests of thy kingdom among men."

Let those that walk in darkness, and labour under many discouragements
in singing these verses, encourage themselves that God himself will be a
light to them.

[Psalms 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">psa 18:29</span></span>

In these verses,

I. David looks back, with thankfulness, upon the great things which God
had done for him. He had not only wrought deliverance for him, but had
given him victory and success, and made him triumph over those who
thought to triumph over him. When we set ourselves to praise God for one
mercy we must be led by that to observe the many more with which we have
been compassed about, and followed, all our days. Many things had
contributed to David's advancement, and he owns the hand of God in them
all, to teach us to do likewise, in reviewing the several steps by which
we have risen to our prosperity. 1. God had given him all his skill and
understanding in military affairs, which he was not bred up to nor
designed for, his genius leading him more to music, and poetry, and a
contemplative life: He teaches my hands to war, [Psa
18:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#034.md). 2. God had given him bodily
strength to go through the business and fatigue of war: God girded him
with strength ([Psa 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#032.md), [Psa
18:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#039).md), to such a degree that he could
break even a bow of steel, [Psa 18:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#034.md).
What service God designs men for he will be sure to fit them for. 3. God
had likewise given him great swiftness, not to flee from the enemies but
to fly upon them ([Psa 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#033).md): He
makes my feet like hinds' feet, [Psa
18:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#036.md). "Thou hast enlarged my steps
under me; but" (whereas those that take large steps are apt to tread
awry) "my feet did not slip." He was so swift that he pursued his
enemies and overtook them, [Psa 18:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#037.md).
4. God had made him very bold and daring in his enterprises, and given
him spirit proportionable to his strength. If a troop stood in his way,
he made nothing of running through them; if a wall, he made nothing of
leaping over it ([Psa 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#029).md); if
ramparts and bulwarks, he soon mounted them, and by divine assistance
set his feet upon the high places of the enemy, [Psa
18:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#033.md). 5. God had protected him, and
kept him safe, in the midst of the greatest perils. Many a time he put
his life in his hand, and yet it was wonderfully preserved: "Thou hast
given me the shield of thy salvation ([Psa
18:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#035).md), and that has compassed me on
every side. By that I have been delivered from the strivings of the
people who aimed at my destruction ([Psa
18:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#043).md), particularly from the violent
man" ([Psa 18:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#048).md), that is, Saul, who
more than once threw a javelin at him. 6. God had prospered him in his
designs; he it was that made his way perfect ([Psa
18:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#032).md) and it was his right hand that
held him up, [Psa 18:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#035.md). 7. God had
given him victory over his enemies, the Philistines, Moabites,
Ammonites, and all that fought against Israel: those especially he
means, yet not excluding the house of Saul, which opposed his coming to
the crown, and the partisans of Absalom and Sheba, who would have
deposed him. He enlarges much upon the goodness of God to him in
defeating his enemies, attributing his victories, not to his own sword
or bow, nor to the valour of his mighty men, but to the favour of God: I
pursued them ([Psa 18:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#037).md), I wounded
them ([Psa 18:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#038).md); for thou hast
girded me with strength ([Psa 18:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#039).md),
else I could not have done it. All the praise is ascribed to God: Thou
hast subdued them under me, [Psa
18:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#039.md). Thou hast given me their necks
([Psa 18:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#040).md), not only to trample upon
them (as [Jos 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024).md), but to cut them
off. Even those who hated David whom God loved, and were enemies to the
Israel of God, in their distress cried unto the Lord: but in vain; he
answered them not. How could they expect he should when it was he whom
they fought against? And, when he disowned them (as he will all those
that act against his people), no other succours could stand them in
stead: There was none to save them, [Psa
18:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#041.md). Those whom God has abandoned
are easily vanquished: Then did I beat them small as the dust, [Psa
18:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#042.md). But those whose cause is just
he avenges ([Psa 18:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#047).md), and those
whom he favours will certainly be lifted up above those that rise up
against them, [Psa 18:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#048.md). 8. God had
raised him to the throne, and not only delivered him and kept him alive,
but dignified him and made him great ([Psa
18:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#035).md): Thy gentleness has increased
me - thy discipline and instruction; so some. The good lessons David
learned in his affliction prepared him for the dignity and power that
were intended him; and the lessening of him helped very much to increase
his greatness. God made him not only a great conqueror, but a great
ruler: Thou hast made me the head of the heathen ([Psa
18:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#043).md); all the neighbouring nations
were tributaries to him. See [Sa2 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#006.md),
[Sa2 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#011.md). In all this David was a
type of Christ, whom the Father brought safely through his conflicts
with the powers of darkness, and made victorious over them, and gave to
be head over all things to his church, which is his body.

II\. David looks up with humble and reverent adorations of the divine
glory and perfection. When God had, by his providence, magnified him, he
endeavours, with his praises, to magnify God, to bless him and exalt
him, [Psa 18:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#046.md). He gives honour to
him, 1. As a living God: The Lord liveth, [Psa
18:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#046.md). We had our lives at first from,
and we owe the continuance of them to, that God who has life in himself
and is therefore fitly called the living God. The gods of the heathen
were dead gods. The best friends we have among men are dying friends.
But God lives, lives for ever, and will not fail those that trust in
him, but, because he lives, they shall live also; for he is their life.
2. As a finishing God: As for God, he is not only perfect himself, but
his way is perfect, [Psa 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#030.md). He is
known by his name Jehovah ([Exo 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003).md),
a God performing and perfecting what he begins in providence as well as
creation, [Gen 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#001.md). If it was God that
made David's way perfect ([Psa 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#032).md),
much more is his own way so. There is no flaw in God's works, nor any
fault to be found with what he does, [Ecc
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#014.md). And what he undertakes he will
go through with, whatever difficulties lie in the way; what God begins
to build he is able to finish. 3. As a faithful God: The word of the
Lord is tried. "I have tried it" (says David), "and it has not failed
me." All the saints, in all ages, have tried it, and it never failed any
that trusted in it. It is tried as silver is tried, refined from all
such mixture and alloy as lessen the value of men's words. David, in
God's providences concerning him, takes notice of the performance of his
promises to him, which, as it puts sweetness into the providence, so it
puts honour upon the promise. 4. As the protector and defender of his
people. David had found him so to him: "He is the God of my salvation
([Psa 18:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#046).md), by whose power and grace
I am and hope to be saved; but not of mine only: he is a buckler to all
those that trust in him ([Psa 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#030).md);
he shelters and protects them all, is both able and ready to do so." 5.
As a non-such in all this, [Psa 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#031.md).
There is a God, and who is God save Jehovah? That God is a rock, for the
support and shelter of his faithful worshippers; and who is a rock save
our God? Thus he not only gives glory to God, but encourages his own
faith in him. Note, (1.) Whoever pretends to be deities, it is certain
that there is no God, save the Lord; all others are counterfeits, [Isa
44:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#008.md); [Jer
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#010). (2..md) Whoever pretends to be our
felicities, there is no rock, save our God; none that we can depend upon
to make us happy.

III\. David looks forward, with a believing hope that God would still do
him good. He promises himself, 1. That his enemies should be completely
subdued, and that those of them that yet remained should be made his
footstool, - that his government should be extensive, so that even a
people whom he had not known should serve him ([Psa
18:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#043).md), - that his conquests, and,
consequently, his acquests, should be easy (As soon as they hear of me
they shall obey me, [Psa 18:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#044).md), - and
that his enemies should be convinced that it was to no purpose to oppose
him; even those that had retired to their fastnesses should not trust to
them, but be afraid out of their close places, having seen so much of
David's wisdom, courage, and success. Thus the Son of David, though he
sees not yet all things put under him, yet knows he shall reign till all
opposing rule, principality, and power shall be quite put down. 2. That
his seed should be forever continued in the Messiah, who, he foresaw,
should come from his loins, [Psa
18:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#050.md). He shows mercy to his anointed,
his Messiah, to David himself, the anointed of the God of Jacob in the
type, and to his seed for evermore. He saith not unto seeds, as of many,
but to his seed, as of one, that is Christ, [Gal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016.md). It is he only that shall reign
for ever, and of the increase of whose government and peace there shall
be no end. Christ is called David, [Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005.md). God has called him his king, [Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md). Great deliverance God does give,
and will give to him, and to his church and people, here called his
seed, for evermore.

In singing these verses we must give God the glory of the victories of
Christ and his church hitherto and of all the deliverances and
advancements of the gospel kingdom, and encourage ourselves and one
another with an assurance that the church militant will be shortly
triumphant, will be eternally so.
