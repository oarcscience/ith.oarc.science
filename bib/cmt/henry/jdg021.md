### [Judges Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#001.md)

[Judges](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jdg 21:0</span></span>

The ruins of the tribe of Benjamin we read of in the foregoing chapter;
now here we have, I. The lamentation which Israel made over these ruins
([Jdg 21:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#001.md), [Jdg
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#006.md), [Jdg
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#015).md). II. The provision they made
for the repair of them out of the 600 men that escaped, for whom they
procured wives, 1. Of the virgins of Jabesh-Gilead, when they destroyed
that city for not sending its forces to the general rendezvous ([Jdg
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#005.md), [Jdg
21:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#007).md). 2. Of the daughters of
Shiloh ([Jdg 21:16-25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#016).md). And so this
melancholy story concludes.

[Judges 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 21:1</span></span>

We may observe in these verses,

I. The ardent zeal which the Israelites had expressed against the
wickedness of the men of Gibeah, as it was countenanced by the tribe of
Benjamin. Occasion is here given to mention two instances of their zeal
on this occasion, which we did not meet with before: - 1. While the
general convention of the states was gathering together, and was waiting
for a full house before they would proceed, they bound themselves with
the great execration, which they called the Cherum, utterly to destroy
all those cities that should not send in their representatives and their
quota of men upon this occasion, or had sentenced those to that curse
who should thus refuse ([Jdg 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#005).md);
for they would look upon such refusers as having no indignation at the
crime committed, no concern for the securing of the nation from God's
judgments by the administration of justice, nor any regard to the
authority of a common consent, by which they were summoned to meet. 2.
When they had met and heard the cause they made another solemn oath that
none of all the thousands of Israel then present, nor any of those whom
they represented (not intending to bind their posterity), should, if
they could help it, marry a daughter to a Benjamite, [Jdg
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#001.md). This was made an article of the
war, not with any design to extirpate the tribe, but because in general
they would treat those who were then actors and abettors of this villany
in all respects as they treated the devoted nations of Canaan, whom they
were not only obliged to destroy, but with whom they were forbidden to
marry; and because, in particular, they judged those unworthy to match
with a daughter of Israel that had been so very barbarous and abusive to
one of the tender sex, than which nothing could be done more base and
villainous, nor a more certain indication given of a mind perfectly lost
to all honour and virtue. We may suppose that the Levite's sending the
mangled pieces of his wife'\[s body to the several tribes helped very
much to inspire them with all this fury, and much more than a bare
narrative of the fact, though ever so well attested, would have done, so
much does the eye affect the heart.

II\. The deep concern which the Israelites did express for the
destruction of the tribe of Benjamin when it was accomplished. Observe,

1\. The tide of their anger at Benjamin's crime did not run so high and
so strong before but the tide of their grief for Benjamin's destruction
ran as high and as strong after: They repented for Benjamin their
brother, [Jdg 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#006.md), [Jdg
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#015.md). They did not repent of their
zeal against the sin; there is a holy indignation against sin, the fruit
of godly sorrow, which is to salvation, not to be repented of, [Co2
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010.md), [Co2
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011.md). But they repented of the sad
consequences of what they had done, that they had carried the matter
further than was either just or necessary. It would have been enough to
destroy all they found in arms; they needed not to have cut off the
husbandmen and shepherds, the women and children. Note, (1.) There may
be over-doing in well-doing. Great care must be taken in the government
of our zeal, lest that which seemed supernatural in its causes prove
unnatural in its effects. That is no good divinity which swallows up
humanity. Many a war is ill ended which was well begun. (2.) Even
necessary justice is to be done with compassion. God does not punish
with delight, nor should men. (3.) Strong passions make work for
repentance. What we say and do in a heat our calmer thoughts commonly
wish undone again. (4.) In a civil war (according to the usage of the
Romans) no victories ought to be celebrated with triumphs, because,
which soever side gets, the community loses, as here there is a tribe
cut off from Israel. What the better is the body for one member's
crushing another? Now,

2\. How did they express their concern? (1.) By their grief for the
breach that was made. They came to the house of God, for thither they
brought all their doubts, all their counsels, all their cares, and all
their sorrows. There was to be heard on this occasion, not the voice of
joy and praise, but only that of lamentation, and mourning, and woe:
They lifted up their voices and wept sore ([Jdg
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#002).md), not so much for the 40,000 whom
they had lost (these would not be so much missed out of eleven tribes),
but for the entire destruction of one whole tribe; for this was the
complaint they poured out before God ([Jdg
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#003).md): There is one tribe lacking. God
had taken care of every tribe; their number twelve was that which they
were known by; every tribe had his station appointed in the camp, and
his stone in the high priest's breast-plate; every tribe had his
blessing both from Jacob and Moses; and it would be an intolerable
reproach to them if they should drop any out of this illustrious jury,
and lose one out of twelve, especially Benjamin, the youngest, who was
particularly dear to Jacob their common ancestor, and whom all the rest
ought to have been in a particular manner tender of. Benjamin is not;
what then will become of Jacob? Benjamin is become a Benoni, the son of
the right hand a son of sorrow! In this trouble they built an altar, not
in competition, but in communion with the appointed altar at the door of
the tabernacle, which was not large enough to contain all the sacrifices
they designed; for they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, to
give thanks for their victory, yet to atone for their own folly in the
pursuit of it, and to implore the divine favour in their present strait.
Every thing that grieves us should bring us to God. (2.) By their
amicable treaty with the poor distressed refugees that were hidden in
the rock Rimmon, to whom they sent an act of indemnity, assuring them,
upon the public faith, that they would now no longer treat them as
enemies, but receive them as brethren, [Jdg
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#013.md). The falling out of friends
should thus be the renewing of friendship. Even those that have sinned,
if at length they repent, must be forgiven and comforted, [Co2
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#007). (3..md) By the care they took to
provide wives for them, that their tribe might be built up again, and
the ruins of it repaired. Had the men of Israel sought themselves, they
would have been secretly pleased with the extinguishing of the families
of Benjamin, because then the land allotted to them would escheat to the
rest of the tribes, ob defectum sanguinis - for want of heirs, and be
easily seized for want of occupants; but those have not the spirit of
Israelites who aim to raise themselves upon the ruins of their
neighbours. They were so far from any design of this kind that all heads
were at work to find out ways and means for the rebuilding of this
tribe. All the women and children of Benjamin were slain: they had sworn
not to marry their daughters to any of them; it was against the divine
law that they should match with the Canaanites; to oblige them to that
would be, in effect, to bid them go and serve other gods. What must they
do then for wives for them? While the poor distressed Benjamites that
were hidden in the rock feared their brethren were contriving to ruin
them, they were at the same time upon a project to prefer them; and it
was this: - \[1.\] There was a piece of necessary justice to be done
upon the city of Jabesh-Gilead, which belonged to the tribe of Gad, on
the other side Jordan. It was found upon looking over the muster-roll
(which was taken, [Jdg 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#002).md) that none
appeared from that city upon the general summons ([Jdg
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#008.md), [Jdg
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#009).md), and it was then resolved,
before it appeared who were absent, that whatever city of Israel should
be guilty of such a contempt of the public authority and interest that
city should be an anathema; Jabesh-Gilead lies under that severe
sentence, which might by no means be dispensed with. Those that had
spared the Canaanites in many places, who were devoted to destruction by
the divine command, could not find in their hearts to spare their
brethren that were devoted by their own curse. Why did they not now send
men to root the Jebusites out of Jerusalem, to avoid whom the poor
Levite had been forced to go to Gibeah? [Jdg
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#011.md), [Jdg
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#012.md). Men are commonly more zealous
to support their own authority than God's. A detachment is therefore
sent of 12,000 men, to execute the sentence upon Jabesh-Gilead. Having
found that when the whole body of the army went against Gibeah the
people were thought too many for God to deliver them into their hands,
on this expedition they sent but a few, [Jdg
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#010.md). Their commission is to put all
to the sword, men, women, and children ([Jdg
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#011).md), according to that law ([Lev
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#029).md), Whatsoever is devoted of men,
by those that have power to do it, shall surely be put to death. \[2.\]
An expedient is hence formed for providing the Benjamites with wives.
When Moses sent the same number of men to avenge the Lord on Midian, the
same orders were given as here, that all married women should be slain
with their husbands, as one with them, but that the virgins should be
saved alive, [Num 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#017.md), [Num
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#018.md). That precedent was sufficient
to support the distinction here made between a wife and a virgin, [Jdg
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#011.md), [Jdg
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#012.md). 400 virgins that were
marriageable were found in Jabesh-Gilead, and these were married to so
many of the surviving Benjamites, [Jdg
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#014.md). Their fathers were not present
when the vow was made not to marry with Benjamites, so that they were
not under any colour of obligation by it: and besides, being a prey
taken in war, they were at the disposal of the conquerors. Perhaps the
alliance now contracted between Benjamin and Jabesh-Gilead made Saul,
who was a Benjamite, the more concerned for that place ([Sa1
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#004).md), though then inhabited by new
families.

[Judges 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 21:16</span></span>

We have here the method that was taken to provide the 200 Benjamites
that remained with wives. And, though the tribe was reduced to a small
number, they were only in care to provide each man with one wife, not
with more under pretence of multiplying them the faster. They may not
bestow their daughters upon them, but to save their oath, and yet marry
some of their daughters to them, they put them into a way of taking them
by surprise, and marrying them, which should be ratified by their
parents' consent, ex post facto - afterwards. The less consideration is
used before the making of a vow, the more, commonly, there is need of
afterwards for the keeping of it.

I. That which gave an opportunity for the doing of this was a public
ball at Shiloh, in the fields, at which all the young ladies of that
city and the parts adjacent that were so disposed met to dance, in
honour of a feast of the Lord then observed, probably the feast of
tabernacles ([Jdg 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#019).md), for that
feast (bishop Patrick says) was the only season wherein the Jewish
virgins were allowed to dance, and that not so much for their own
recreation as to express their holy joy, as David when he danced before
the ark, otherwise the present melancholy posture of public affairs
would have made dancing unseasonable, as [Isa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#012.md), [Isa
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#013.md). The dancing was very modest and
chaste. It was not mixed dancing; no men danced with these daughters of
Shiloh, nor did any married women so far forget their gravity as to join
with them. However their dancing thus in public made them an easy prey
to those that had a design upon them, whence bishop Hall observes that
the ambushes of evil spirits carry away many souls from dancing to a
fearful desolation.

II\. The elders of Israel gave authority to the Benjamites to do this,
to lie in wait in the vineyards which surrounded the green they used to
dance on, and, when they were in the midst of their sport, to come upon
them, and catch every man a wife for himself, and carry them straight
away to their own country, [Jdg 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#020.md),
[Jdg 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#021.md). They knew that none of
their own daughters would be there, so that the parents of these virgins
could not be said to give them, for they knew nothing of the matter. A
sorry salvo is better than none, to save the breaking of an oath: it
were much better to be cautious in making vows, that there be not
occasion afterwards, as there was here, to say before the angel that it
was an error. Here was a very preposterous way of match-making, when
both the mutual affection of the young people and the consent of the
parents must be presumed to come after; the case was extraordinary, and
may by no means be drawn into a precedent. Over hasty marriages often
occasion a leisurely repentance; and what comfort can be expected from a
match made either by force or fraud? The virgins of Jabesh-Gilead were
taken out of the midst of blood and slaughter, but these of Shiloh out
of the midst of mirth and joy; the former had reason to be thankful that
they had their lives for a prey, and the latter, it is to be hoped, had
no cause to complain, after a while, when they found themselves matched,
not to men of broken and desperate fortunes, as they seemed to be, who
were lately fetched out of a cave, but to men of the best and largest
estates in the nation, as they must needs be when the lot of the whole
tribe of Benjamin, which consisted of 45,600 men ([Num
26:41](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#041).md), came to be divided again among
600, who had all by survivorship.

III\. They undertook to pacify the fathers of these young women. As to
the infringement of their paternal authority, they would easily forgive
it when they considered to what fair estates their daughters were
matched and what mothers in Israel they were likely to be; but the oath
they were bound by, not to give their daughters to Benjamites, might
perhaps stick with some of them, whose consciences were tender, yet, as
to that, this might satisfy them: - 1. That the necessity was urgent
([Jdg 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#022).md): We reserved not to each
man his wife, owning now that they did ill to destroy all the women, and
desiring to atone for their too rigorous construction of their vow to
destroy them by the most favourable construction of their vow not to
match with them. "And therefore for our sakes, who were too severe, let
them keep what they have got." For, 2. In strictness it was not a breach
of their vow; they had sworn not to give them their daughters, but they
had not sworn to fetch them back if they were forcibly taken, so that if
there was any fault the elders must be responsible, not the parents. And
Quod fieri non debuit, factum valet - That which ought not to have been
done is yet valid when it is done. The thing was done, and is ratified
only by connivance, according to the law, [Num
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#004.md).

Lastly, In the close of all we have, 1. The settling of the tribe of
Benjamin again. The few that remained returned to the inheritance of
that tribe, [Jdg 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#023.md). And soon after
from among them sprang Ehud, who was famous in his generation, the
second judge of Israel, [Jdg 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#015.md). 2.
The disbanding and dispersing of the army of Israel, [Jdg
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#024.md). They did not set up for a
standing army, nor pretend to make any alterations or establishments in
the government; but when the affair was over for which they were called
together, they quietly departed in God's peace, every man to his family.
Public services must not make us think ourselves above our own private
affairs and the duty of providing for our own house. 3. A repetition of
the cause of these confusions, [Jdg
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#025.md). Though God was their King,
every man would be his own master, as if there was no king. Blessed be
God for magistracy.
