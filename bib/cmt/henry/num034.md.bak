### [Numbers Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 34:0</span></span>

In this chapter God directs Moses, and he is to direct Israel, I.
Concerning the bounds and borders of the land of Canaan ([Num
34:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#001).md). II. Concerning the division
and distribution of it to the tribes of Israel ([Num
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#016), etc..md).

[Numbers 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 34:1</span></span>

We have here a particular draught of the line by which the land of
Canaan was meted, and bounded, on all sides. God directs Moses to settle
it here, not as a geographer in his map, merely to please the curious,
but as a prince in his grant, that it may be certainly known what
passes, and is conveyed, by the grant. There was a much larger
possession promised them, which in due time they would have possessed if
they had been obedient, reaching even to the river Euphrates, [Deu
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#024.md). And even so far the dominion of
Israel did extend in David's time and Solomon's, [Ch2
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#026.md). But this which is here described
is Canaan only, which was the lot of the nine tribes and a half, for the
other two and a half were already settled, [Num
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#014.md), [Num
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#015.md). Now concerning the limits of
Canaan observe,

I. That it was limited within certain bounds: for God appoints the
bounds of our habitation, [Act 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#026.md).
The borders are set them, 1. That they might know whom they were to
dispossess, and how far the commission which was given them extended
([Num 33:53](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#053).md), that they should drive
out the inhabitants. Those that lay within these borders, and those
only, they must destroy; hitherto their bloody sword must go, and no
further. 2. That they might know what to expect the possession of
themselves. God would not have his people to enlarge their desire of
worldly possessions, but to know when they have enough, and to rest
satisfied with it. The Israelites themselves must not be placed alone in
the midst of the earth, but must leave room for their neighbours to live
by them. God sets bounds to our lot; let us then set bounds to our
desires, and bring our mind to our condition.

II\. That it lay comparatively in a very little compass: as it is here
bounded, it is reckoned to be but about 160 miles in length and about
fifty in breadth; perhaps it did not contain more than half as much
ground as England, and yet this is the country which was promised to the
father of the faithful and was the possession of the seed of Israel.
This was that little spot of ground in which only, for many ages, God
was known, and his name was great, [Psa
76:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md). This was the vineyard of the
Lord, the garden enclosed; but, as it is with gardens and vineyards, the
narrowness of the extent was abundantly compensated by the extraordinary
fruitfulness of the soil, otherwise it could not have subsisted so
numerous a nation as did inhabit it. See here then, 1. How small a part
of the world God has for himself. Though the earth is his, and the
fullness thereof, yet few have the knowledge of him and serve him; but
those few are happy, very happy, because fruitful to God. 2. How small a
share of the world God often gives to his own people. Those that have
their portion in heaven have reason to be content with a small pittance
of this earth; but, as here, what is wanting in quantity is made up in
quality; a little that a righteous man has, having it from the love of
God and with his blessing, is far better and more comfortable than the
riches of many wicked, [Psa 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#016.md).

III\. It is observable what the bounds and limits of it were. 1. Canaan
was itself a pleasant land (so it is called [Dan
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009).md), and yet it bordered upon
wilderness and seas, and was surrounded with divers melancholy
prospects. Thus the vineyard of the church is compassed on all hands
with the desert of this world, which serves as a foil to it, to make it
appear the more beautiful for situation. 2. Many of its borders were its
defences and natural fortifications, to render the access of enemies the
more difficult, and to intimate to Israel that the God of nature was
their protector, and with his favour would compass them as with a
shield. 3. The border reached to the river of Egypt ([Num
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#005).md), that the sight of that country
which they could look into out of their own might remind them of their
bondage there, and their wonderful deliverance thence. 4. Their border
is here made to begin at the Salt Sea ([Num
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#003).md), and there it ends, [Num
34:12](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#012.md). This was the remaining lasting
monument of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. That pleasant
fruitful vale in which these cities stood became a lake, which was never
stirred by any wind, bore no vessels, was replenished with no fish, no
living creature of any sort being found in it, therefore called the Dead
Sea. This was part of their border, that it might be a constant warning
to them to take heed of those sins which had been the ruin of Sodom; yet
the iniquity of Sodom was afterwards found in Israel ([Eze
16:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#049).md), for which Canaan was made,
though not a salt sea as Sodom, yet a barren soil, and continues so to
this day. 5. Their western border was the Great Sea ([Num
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#006).md), which is now called the
Mediterranean. Some consider this sea itself to have been a part of
their possession, and that by virtue of this grant, they had the
dominion of it, and, if they had not forfeited it by sin, might have
rode masters of it.

[Numbers 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 34:16</span></span>

God here appoints commissioners for the dividing of the land to them.
The conquest of it is taken for granted, though as yet there was never a
stroke struck towards it. Here is no nomination of the generals and
commanders-in-chief that should carry on the war; for they were to get
the land in possession, not by their own sword or bow, but by the power
and favour of God; and so confident must they be of victory and success
while God fought for them that the persons must now be named who should
be entrusted with the dividing of the land, that is, who should preside
in casting the lots, and determine controversies that might arise, and
see that all was done fairly. 1. The principal commissioners, who were
of the quorum, were Eleazar and Joshua ([Num
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#017).md), typifying Christ, who, as
priest and king, divides the heavenly Canaan to the spiritual Israel;
yet, as they were to go by the lot, so Christ acknowledges the disposal
must be by the will of the Father, [Mat
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#023.md). Compare, [Eph
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011.md). 2. Besides these, that there
might be no suspicion of partiality, a prince of each tribe was
appointed to inspect this matter, and to see that the tribe he served
for was in no respect injured. Public affairs should be so managed as
not only to give their right to all, but, if possible, to give
satisfaction to all that they have justice done them., It is a happiness
to a land to have the princes of their people meet together, some out of
every tribe, to concert the affairs that are of common concern, a
constitution which is the abundant honour, ease, and safety, of the
nation that is blessed with it. 3. Some observe that the order of the
tribes here very much differs from that in which they hitherto, upon all
occasions, been named, and agrees with the neighbourhood of their lots
in the division of the land. Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin, the first
three here named, lay close together; the inheritance of Dan lay next
them on one side, that of Ephraim and Manasseh on another side; Zebulun
and Issachar lay abreast more northerly, and, lastly, Asher and Naphtali
most northward of all, as is easy to observe in looking over a map of
Canaan; this (says bishop Patrick) is an evidence that Moses was guided
by a divine Spirit in his writings. Known unto God are all his works
beforehand, and what is new and surprising to us he perfectly foresaw,
without any confusion or uncertainty.
