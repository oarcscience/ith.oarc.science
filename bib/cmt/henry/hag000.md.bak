An Exposition, with Practical Observations, of The Prophecy of Haggai

The captivity in Babylon gave a very remarkable turn to the affairs of
the Jewish church both in history and prophecy. It is made a signal
epocha in our Saviour's genealogy, [Mat
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#017.md). Nine of the twelve minor
prophets, whose oracles we have been hitherto consulting, lived and
preached before that captivity, and most of them had an eye to it in
their prophecies, foretelling it as the just punishment of Jerusalem's
wickedness. But the last three (in whom the Spirit of prophecy took its
period, until it revived in Christ's forerunner) lived and preached
after the return out of captivity, not immediately upon it, but some
time after. Haggai and Zechariah appeared much about the same time,
eighteen years after the return, when the building of the temple was
both retarded by its enemies and neglected by its friends. Then the
prophets, Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied
unto the Jews that were in Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel,
even unto them (so we read [Ezr 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001).md),
to reprove them for their remissness, and to encourage them to revive
that good work when it had stood still for some time, and to go on with
it vigorously, notwithstanding the opposition they met with in it.
Haggai began two months before Zechariah, who was raised up to second
him, that out of the mouth of two witnesses the word might be
established. But Zechariah continued longer at the work; for all
Haggai's prophecies that are recorded were delivered within four months,
in the second year of Darius, between the beginning of the sixth month
and the end of the ninth. But we have Zechariah's prophecies dated above
two years after, [Zac 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001.md). Some have
the honour to lead, others to last, in the work of God. The Jews ascribe
to these two prophets the honour of being members of the great synagogue
(as they call it), which was formed after the return out of captivity;
we think it more certain, and it was their honour, and a much greater
honour, that they prophesied of Christ. Haggai spoke of him as the glory
of the latter house, and Zechariah as the man, the branch. In them the
light of that morning star shone more brightly than in the foregoing
prophecies, as they lived nearer the time of the rising of the Sun of
righteousness, and now began to see his day approaching. The Septuagint
makes Haggai and Zechariah to be the penmen of [Psa
138:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#001.md) and [Psa
146:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001.md),147, and [Psa
148:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#001.md).
