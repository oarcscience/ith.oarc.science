### [Leviticus Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 11:0</span></span>

The ceremonial law is described by the apostle ([Heb
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009.md), [Heb
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010).md) to consist, not only "in gifts
and sacrifices," which hitherto have been treated of in this book, but
"in meats, and drinks, and divers washings" from ceremonial uncleanness,
the laws concerning which begin with this chapter, which puts a
difference between some sorts of flesh-meat and others, allowing some to
be eaten as clean and forbidding others as unclean. "There is one kind
of flesh of men." Nature startles at the thought of eating this, and
none do it but such as have arrived at the highest degree of barbarity,
and become but one remove from brutes; therefore there needed no law
against it. But there is "another kind of flesh of beasts," concerning
which the law directs here ([Lev
11:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#001).md), "another of fishes" ([Lev
11:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#009).md), "another of birds" ([Lev
11:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#013).md), and "another of creeping
things," which are distinguished into two sorts, flying creeping things
([Lev 11:20-28](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#020).md) and creeping things
upon the earth ([Lev 11:29-43](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#029).md). And
the law concludes with the general rule of holiness, and reasons for it
([Lev 11:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#044), etc..md).

[Leviticus 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 11:1</span></span>

Now that Aaron was consecrated a high priest over the house of God, God
spoke to him with Moses, and appointed them both as joint-commissioners
to deliver his will to the people. He spoke both to Moses and to Aaron
about this matter; for it was particularly required of the priests that
they should put a difference between clean and unclean, and teach the
people to do so. After the flood, when God entered into covenant with
Noah and his sons, he allowed them to eat flesh ([Gen
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#013).md), whereas before they were
confined to the productions of the earth. But the liberty allowed to the
sons of Noah is here limited to the sons of Israel. They might eat
flesh, but not all kinds of flesh; some they must look upon as unclean
and forbidden to them, others as clean and allowed them. The law in this
matter is both very particular and very strict. But what reason can be
given for this law? Why may not God's people have as free a use of all
the creatures as other people? 1. It is reason enough that God would
have it so: his will, as it is law sufficient, so it is reason
sufficient; for his will is his wisdom. He saw good thus to try and
exercise the obedience of his people, not only in the solemnities of his
altar, but in matters of daily occurrence at their own table, that they
might remember they were under authority. Thus God had tried the
obedience of man in innocency, by forbidding him to eat of one
particular tree. 2. Most of the meats forbidden as unclean are such as
were really unwholesome, and not fit to be eaten; and those of them that
we think wholesome enough, and use accordingly, as the rabbit, the hare,
and the swine, perhaps in those countries, and to their bodies, might be
hurtful. And then God in this law did by them but as a wise and loving
father does by his children, whom he restrains from eating that which he
knows will make them sick. Note, The Lord is for the body, and it is not
only folly, but sin against God, to prejudice our health for the
pleasing of our appetite. 3. God would thus teach his people to
distinguish themselves from other people, not only in their religious
worship, but in the common actions of life. Thus he would show them that
they must not be numbered among the nations. It should seem there had
been, before this, some difference between the Hebrews and other nations
in their food, kept up by tradition; for the Egyptians and they would
not eat together, [Gen 43:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#032.md). And even
before the flood there was a distinction of beasts into clean and not
clean ([Gen 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#002).md), which distinction
was quite lost, with many other instances of religion, among the
Gentiles. But by this law it is reduced to a certainty, and ordered to
be kept up among the Jews, that thus, by having a diet peculiar to
themselves, they might be kept from familiar conversation with their
idolatrous neighbours, and might typify God's spiritual Israel, who not
in these little things, but in the temper of their spirits, and the
course of their lives, should be governed by a sober singularity, and
not be conformed to this world. The learned observe further, That most
of the creatures which by this law were to be abominated as unclean were
such as were had in high veneration among the heathen, not so much for
food as for divination and sacrifice to their gods; and therefore those
are here mentioned as unclean, and an abomination, which yet they would
not be in any temptation to eat, that they might keep up a religious
loathing of that for which the Gentiles had a superstitious value. The
swine, with the later Gentiles, was sacred to Venus, the owl to Minerva,
the eagle to Jupiter, the dog to Hecate, etc., and all these are here
made unclean. As to the beasts, there is a general rule laid down, that
those which both part the hoof and chew the cud were clean, and those
only: these are particularly mentioned in the repetition of this law
([Deu 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#004.md), [Deu
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#005).md), where it appears that the
Israelites had variety enough allowed them, and needed not to complain
of the confinement they were under. Those beasts that did not both chew
the cud and divide the hoof were unclean, by which rule the flesh of
swine, and of hares, and of rabbits, was prohibited to them, though
commonly used among us. Therefore, particularly at the eating of any of
these, we should give thanks for the liberty granted us in this matter
by the gospel, which teaches us that every creature of God is good, and
we are to call nothing common or unclean. Some observe a significancy in
the rule here laid down for them to distinguish by, or at least think it
may be alluded to. Meditation, and other acts of devotion done by the
hidden man of the heart, may be signified by the chewing of the cud,
digesting our spiritual food; justice and charity towards men, and the
acts of a good conversation, may be signified by the dividing of the
hoof. Now either of these without the other will not serve to recommend
us to God, but both must go together, good affections in the heart and
good works in the life: if either be wanting, we are not clean, surely
we are not clean. Of all the creatures here forbidden as unclean, none
has been more dreaded and detested by the pious Jews than swine's flesh.
Many were put to death by Antiochus because they would not eat it. This,
probably, they were most in danger of being tempted to, and therefore
possessed themselves and their children with a particular antipathy to
it, calling it not by its proper name, but a strange thing. It should
seem the Gentiles used it superstitiously ([Isa
65:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#004).md), they eat swine's flesh; and
therefore God forbids all use of it to his people, lest they should
learn of their neighbours to make that ill use of it. Some suggest that
the prohibition of these beasts as unclean was intended to be a caution
to the people against the bad qualities of these creatures. We must not
be filthy nor wallow in the mire as swine, nor be timorous and
faint-hearted as hares, nor dwell in the earth as rabbits; let not man
that is in honour make himself like these beasts that perish. The law
forbade, not only the eating of them, but the very touching of them; for
those that would be kept from any sin must be careful to avoid all
temptations to it, and every thing that looks towards it or leads to it.

[Leviticus 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 11:9</span></span>

Here is, 1. A general rule concerning fishes, which were clean and which
not. All that had fins and scales they might eat, and only those odd
sorts of water-animals that have not were forbidden, [Lev
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#009.md), [Lev
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#010.md). The ancients accounted fish the
most delicate food (so far were they from allowing it on fasting-days,
or making it an instance of mortification to eat fish); therefore God
did not lay much restraint upon his people in them; for he is a Master
that allows his servants not only for necessity but for delight.
Concerning the prohibited fish it is said, They shall be an abomination
to you ([Lev 11:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#010).md), that is, "You
shall count them unclean, and not only not eat of them, but keep at a
distance from them." Note, Whatever is unclean should be to us an
abomination; touch not the unclean thing. But observe, It was to be an
abomination only to Jews; the neighbouring nations were under none of
these obligations, nor are these things to be an abomination to us
Christians. The Jews were honoured with peculiar privileges, and
therefore, lest they should be proud of those, Transeunt cum onere -
They were likewise laid under peculiar restraints. Thus God's spiritual
Israel, as they are dignified above others by the gospel-covenant of
adoption and friendship, so they must be mortified more than others by
the gospel-commands of self-denial and bearing the cross. 2. Concerning
fowls here is no general rule given, but a particular enumeration of
those fowls that they must abstain from as unclean, which implies an
allowance of all others. The critics here have their hands full to find
out what is the true signification of the Hebrew words here used, some
of which still remain uncertain, some sorts of fowls being peculiar to
some countries. Were the law in force now, we should be concerned to
know with certainty what are prohibited by it; and perhaps if we did,
and were better acquainted with the nature of the fowls here mentioned,
we should admire the knowledge of Adam, in giving them names expressive
of their natures, [Gen 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#020.md). But the
law being repealed, and the learning in a great measure lost, it is
sufficient for us to observe that of the fowls here forbidden, (1.) Some
are birds of prey, as the eagle, vulture, etc., and God would have his
people to abhor every thing that is barbarous and cruel, and not to live
by blood and rapine. Doves that are preyed upon were fit to be food for
man and offerings to God; but kites and hawks that prey upon them must
be looked upon as an abomination to God and man; for the condition of
those that are persecuted for righteousness' sake appears to an eye of
faith every way better than that of their persecutors. (2.) Others of
them are solitary birds, that abide in dark and desolate places, as the
owl and the pelican ([Psa 102:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#006).md), and
the cormorant and raven ([Isa 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011).md);
for God's Israel should not be a melancholy people, nor affect sadness
and constant solitude. (3.) Others of them feed upon that which is
impure, as the stork on serpents, others of them on worms; and we must
not only abstain from all impurity ourselves, but from communion with
those that allow themselves in it. (4.) Others of them were used by the
Egyptians and other Gentiles in their divinations. Some birds were
reckoned fortunate, others ominous; and their soothsayers had great
regard to the flights of these birds, all which therefore must be an
abomination to God's people, who must not learn the way of the heathen.

[Leviticus 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 11:20</span></span>

Here is the law, 1. Concerning flying insects, as flies, wasps, bees,
etc.; these they might not eat ([Lev
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#020).md), nor indeed are they fit to be
eaten; but there were several sorts of locusts which in those countries
were very good meat, and much used: John Baptist lived upon them in the
desert, and they are here allowed them, [Lev
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#021.md), [Lev
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#022.md). 2. Concerning the creeping
things on the earth; these were all forbidden ([Lev
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#029.md), [Lev
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#030.md), and again, [Lev
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#041.md), [Lev
11:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#042).md); for it was the curse of the
serpent that upon his belly he should go, and therefore between him and
man there was an enmity put ([Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015).md), which was preserved by this
law. Dust is the meat of the creeping things, and therefore they are not
fit to be man's meat. 3. Concerning the dead carcasses of all these
unclean animals. (1.) Every one that touched them was to be unclean
until the evening, [Lev 11:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#024.md). This
law is often repeated, to possess them with a dread of every thing that
was prohibited, though no particular reason for the prohibition did
appear, but only the will of the Law-maker. Not that they were to be
looked upon as defiling to the conscience, or that it was a sin against
God to touch them, unless done in contempt of the law: in many cases,
somebody must of necessity touch them, to remove them; but it was a
ceremonial uncleanness they contracted, which for the time forbade them
to come into the tabernacle, or to eat of any of the holy things, or so
much as to converse familiarly with their neighbours. But the
uncleanness continued only till the evening, to signify that all
ceremonial pollutions were to come to an end by the death of Christ in
the evening of the world. And we must learn, by daily renewing our
repentance every night for the sins of the day, to cleanse ourselves
from the pollution we contract by them, that we may not lie down in our
uncleanness. Even unclean animals they might touch while they were alive
without contracting any ceremonial uncleanness by it, as horses and
dogs, because they were allowed to use them for service; but they might
not touch them when they were dead, because they might not eat their
flesh; and what must not be eaten must not be touched, [Gen
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#003). (2..md) Even the vessels, or other
things they fell upon, were thereby made unclean until the evening ([Lev
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#032).md), and if they were earthen
vessels they must be broken, [Lev
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#033.md). This taught them carefully to
avoid every thing that was polluting, even in their common actions. Not
only the vessels of the sanctuary, but every pot in Jerusalem and Judah,
must be holiness to the Lord, [Zac
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#020.md), [Zac
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#021.md). The laws in these cases are
very critical, and the observance of them would be difficult, we should
think, if every thing that a dead mouse or rat, for instance, falls upon
must be unclean; and if it were an oven, or ranges for pots, they must
all be broken down, [Lev 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#035.md). The
exceptions also are very nice, [Lev
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#036.md), etc. All this was designed to
exercise them to a constant care and exactness in their obedience, and
to teach us, who by Christ are delivered from these burdensome
observances, not to be less circumspect in the more weighty matters of
the law. We ought as industriously to preserve our precious souls from
the pollutions of sin, and as speedily to cleanse them when they are
polluted, as they were to preserve and cleanse their bodies and
household goods from those ceremonial pollutions.

[Leviticus 11:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">lev 11:43</span></span>

Here is, I. The exposition of this law, or a key to let us into the
meaning of it. It was not intended merely for a bill of fare, or as the
directions of a physician about their diet, but God would hereby teach
them to sanctify themselves and to be holy, [Lev
11:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#044.md). That is, 1. They must hereby
learn to put a difference between good and evil, and to reckon that it
could not be all alike what they did, when it was not all alike what
they ate. 2. To maintain a constant observance of the divine law, and to
govern themselves by that in all their actions, even those that are
common, which ought to be performed after a godly sort, [Jo3
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#006.md). Even eating and drinking must be
by rule, and to the glory of God, [Co1
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#031.md). 3. To distinguish themselves
from all their neighbours, as a people set apart for God, and obliged
not to walk as the Gentiles: and all this is holiness. Thus these
rudiments of the world were their tutors and governors ([Gal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#002.md), [Gal
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003).md), to bring them to that which is
the revival of our first state in Adam and the earnest of our best state
with Christ, that is, holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.
This is indeed the great design of all the ordinances, that by them we
may sanctify ourselves and learn to be holy. Even This law concerning
their food, which seemed to stoop so very low, aimed thus high, for it
was the statute-law of heaven, under the Old Testament as well as the
New, that without holiness no man shall see the Lord. The caution
therefore ([Lev 11:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#043).md) is, You shall
not make yourselves abominable. Note, By having fellowship with sin,
which is abominable, we make ourselves abominable. That man is truly
miserable who is in the sight of God abominable; and none are so but
those that make themselves so. The Jewish writers themselves suggest
that the intention of this law was to forbid them all communion by
marriage, or otherwise, with the heathen, [Deu
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#002.md), [Deu
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#003.md). And thus the moral of it is
obligatory on us, forbidding us to have fellowship with the unfruitful
works of darkness; and, without this real holiness of the heart and
life, he that offereth an oblation is as if he offered swine's blood
([Isa 66:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#003).md); and, if it was such a
provocation for a man to eat swine's flesh himself, much more it must be
so to offer swine's blood at God's altar; see [Pro
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#008.md).

II\. The reasons of this law; and they are all taken from the Law-maker
himself, to whom we must have respect in all acts of obedience. 1. I am
the Lord your God, [Lev 11:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#044.md).
"Therefore you are bound to do thus, in pure obedience." God's
sovereignty over us, and propriety in us, oblige us to do whatever he
commands us, how much soever it crosses our inclinations. 2. I am holy,
[Lev 11:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#044.md), and again, [Lev
11:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#045.md). If God be holy, we must be so,
else we cannot expect to be accepted of him. His holiness is his glory
([Exo 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011).md), and therefore it becomes
his house for ever, [Psa 93:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#005.md). This
great precept, thus enforced, though it comes in here in the midst of
abrogated laws, is quoted and stamped for a gospel precept, [Pe1
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#016.md), where it is intimated that all
these ceremonial restraints were designed to teach us that we must not
fashion ourselves according to our former lusts in our ignorance, [Lev
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#014.md). 3. I am the Lord that bringeth
you out of the land of Egypt, [Lev
11:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#045.md). This was a reason why they
should cheerfully submit to distinguishing laws, having of late been so
wonderfully dignified with distinguishing favours. He that had done more
for them than for any other people might justly expect more from them.

III\. The conclusion of this statute: This is the law of the beasts, and
of the fowl, etc., [Lev 11:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#046.md), [Lev
11:47](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#047.md). This law was to them a statute
for ever, that is, as long as that economy lasted; but under the gospel
we find it expressly repealed by a voice from heaven to Peter ([Act
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#015).md), as it had before been
virtually set aside by the death of Christ, with the other ordinances
that perished in the using: Touch not, taste not, handle not, [Col
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#021.md), [Col
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#022.md). And now we are sure that meat
commends us not to God ([Co1 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#008).md), and
that nothing is unclean of itself ([Rom
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#014).md), nor does that defile a man
which goes into his mouth, but that which comes out from the heart, [Mat
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#011.md). Let us therefore, 1. Give
thanks to God that we are not under this yoke, but that to us every
creature of God is allowed as good, and nothing to be refused. 2. Stand
fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, and take heed of
those doctrines which command to abstain from meats, and so would revive
Moses again, [Ti1 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#003.md), [Ti1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#004.md). 3. Be strictly and
conscientiously temperate in the use of the good creatures God has
allowed us. If God's law has given us liberty, let us lay restraints
upon ourselves, and never feed ourselves without fear, lest our table be
a snare. Set a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite;
and be not desirous of dainties or varieties, [Pro
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#002.md), [Pro
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#003.md). Nature is content with little,
grace with less, but lust with nothing.
