### [Exodus Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 20:0</span></span>

All things being prepared for the solemn promulgation of the divine law,
we have, in this chapter, I. The ten commandments, as God himself spoke
them upon mount Sinai (v. 1-17), as remarkable a portion of scripture as
any in the Old Testament. II. The impressions made upon the people
thereby ([Exo 20:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#018).md). III. Some
particular instructions which God gave privately to Moses, to be by him
communicated to the people, relating to his worship ([Exo
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#022), etc..md).

[Exodus 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 20:1</span></span>

Here is, I. The preface of the law-writer, Moses: God spoke all these
words, [Exo 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#001.md). The law of the ten
commandments is, 1. A law of God's making. They are enjoined by the
infinite eternal Majesty of heaven and earth. And where the word of the
King of kings is surely there is power. 2. It is a law of his own
speaking. God has many ways of speaking to the children of men ([Job
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#014).md); once, yea twice - by his
Spirit, by conscience, by providences, by his voice, all which we ought
carefully to attend to; but he never spoke, at any time, upon any
occasion, as he spoke the ten commandments, which therefore we ought to
hear with the more earnest heed. They were not only spoken audibly (so
he owned the Redeemer by a voice from heaven, [Mat
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017).md), but with a great deal of
dreadful pomp. This law God had given to man before (it was written in
his heart by nature); but sin had so defaced that writing that it was
necessary, in this manner, to revive the knowledge of it.

II\. The preface of the Law-maker: I am the Lord thy God, [Exo
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#002.md). Herein, 1. God asserts his own
authority to enact this law in general: "I am the Lord who command thee
all that follows." 2. He proposes himself as the sole object of that
religious worship which is enjoined in the first four of the
commandments. They are here bound to obedience by a threefold cord,
which, one would think, could not easily be broken. (1.) Because God is
the Lord - Jehovah, self-existent, independent, eternal, and the
fountain of all being and power; therefore he has an incontestable right
to command us. He that gives being may give law; and therefore he is
able to bear us out in our obedience, to reward it, and to punish our
disobedience. (2.) He was their God, a God in covenant with them, their
God by their own consent; and, if they would not keep his commandments,
who would? He had laid himself under obligations to them by promise, and
therefore might justly lay his obligations on them by precept. Though
that covenant of peculiarity is now no more, yet there is another, by
virtue of which all that are baptized are taken into relation to him as
their God, and are therefore unjust, unfaithful, and very ungrateful, if
they obey him not. (3.) He had brought them out of the land of Egypt;
therefore they were bound in gratitude to obey him, because he had done
them so great a kindness, had brought them out of a grievous slavery
into a glorious liberty. They themselves had been eye-witnesses of the
great things God had done in order to their deliverance, and could not
but have observed that every circumstance of it heightened their
obligation. They were now enjoying the blessed fruits of their
deliverance, and in expectation of a speedy settlement in Canaan; and
could they think any thing too much to do for him that had done so much
for them? Nay, by redeeming them, he acquired a further right to rule
them; they owed their service to him to whom they owed their freedom,
and whose they were by purchase. And thus Christ, having rescued us out
of the bondage of sin, is entitled to the best service we can do him,
[Luk 1:74](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#074.md). Having loosed our bonds, he
has bound us to obey him, [Psa 116:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#016.md).

III\. The law itself. The first four of the ten commandments, which
concern our duty to God (commonly called the first table), we have in
these verses. It was fit that those should be put first, because man had
a Maker to love before he had a neighbour to love; and justice and
charity are acceptable acts of obedience to God only when they flow from
the principles of piety. It cannot be expected that he should be true to
his brother who is false to his God. Now our duty to God is, in one
word, to worship him, that is, to give to him the glory due to his name,
the inward worship of our affections, the outward worship of solemn
address and attendance. This is spoken of as the sum and substance of
the everlasting gospel. [Rev 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#007.md),
Worship God.

1\. The first commandment concerns the object of our worship, Jehovah,
and him only ([Exo 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#003).md): Thou shalt
have no other gods before me. The Egyptians, and other neighbouring
nations, had many gods, the creatures of their own fancy, strange gods,
new gods; this law was prefixed because of that transgression, and,
Jehovah being the God of Israel, they must entirely cleave to him, and
not be for any other, either of their own invention or borrowed from
their neighbours. This was the sin they were most in danger of now that
the world was so overspread with polytheism, which yet could not be
rooted out effectually but by the gospel of Christ. The sin against this
commandment which we are most in danger of is giving the glory and
honour to any creature which are due to God only. Pride makes a god of
self, covetousness makes a god of money, sensuality makes a god of the
belly; whatever is esteemed or loved, feared or served, delighted in or
depended on, more than God, that (whatever it is) we do in effect make a
god of. This prohibition includes a precept which is the foundation of
the whole law, that we take the Lord for our God, acknowledge that he is
God, accept him for ours, adore him with admiration and humble
reverence, and set our affections entirely upon him. In the last words,
before me, it is intimated, (1.) That we cannot have any other God but
he will certainly know it. There is none besides him but what is before
him. Idolaters covet secresy; but shall not God search this out? (2.)
That it is very provoking to him; it is a sin that dares him to his
face, which he cannot, which he will not, overlook, nor connive at. See
[Psa 44:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#020.md), [Psa
44:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#021.md).

2\. The second commandment concerns the ordinances of worship, or the
way in which God will be worshipped, which it is fit that he himself
should have the appointing of. Here is,

(1.) The prohibition: we are here forbidden to worship even the true God
by images, [Exo 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#004.md), [Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005.md). \[1.\] The Jews (at least after
the captivity) thought themselves forbidden by this commandment to make
any image or picture whatsoever. Hence the very images which the Roman
armies had in their ensigns are called an abomination to them ([Mat
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015).md), especially when they were set
up in the holy place. It is certain that it forbids making any image of
God (for to whom can we liken him? [Isa
40:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#018.md), [Isa
40:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#015).md), or the image of any creature
for a religious use. It is called the changing of the truth of God into
a lie ([Rom 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#025).md), for an image is a
teacher of lies; it insinuates to us that God has a body, whereas he is
an infinite spirit, [Hab 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#018.md). It also
forbids us to make images of God in our fancies, as if he were a man as
we are. Our religious worship must be governed by the power of faith,
not by the power of imagination. They must not make such images or
pictures as the heathen worshipped, lest they also should be tempted to
worship them. Those who would be kept from sin must keep themselves from
the occasions of it. \[2.\] They must not bow down to them occasionally,
that is, show any sign of respect or honour to them, much less serve
them constantly, by sacrifice or incense, or any other act of religious
worship. When they paid their devotion to the true God, they must not
have any image before them, for the directing, exciting, or assisting of
their devotion. Though the worship was designed to terminate in God, it
would not please him if it came to him through an image. The best and
most ancient lawgivers among the heathen forbade the setting up of
images in their temples. This practice was forbidden in Rome by Numa, a
pagan prince; yet commanded in Rome by the pope, a Christian bishop,
but, in this, anti-christian. The use of images in the church of Rome,
at this day, is so plainly contrary to the letter of this command, and
so impossible to be reconciled to it, that in all their catechisms and
books of devotion, which they put into the hands of the people, they
leave out this commandment, joining the reason of it to the first; and
so the third commandment they call the second, the fourth the third,
etc.; only, to make up the number ten, they divide the tenth into two.
Thus have they committed two great evils, in which they persist, and
from which they hate to be reformed; they take away from God's word, and
add to his worship.

(2.) The reasons to enforce this prohibition ([Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005.md), [Exo
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#006).md), which are, \[1.\] God's
jealousy in the matters of his worship: "I am the Lord Jehovah, and thy
God, am a jealous God, especially in things of this nature." This
intimates the care he has of his own institutions, his hatred of
idolatry and all false worship, his displeasure against idolaters, and
that he resents every thing in his worship that looks like, or leads to,
idolatry. Jealousy is quicksighted. Idolatry being spiritual adultery,
as it is very often represented in scripture, the displeasure of God
against it is fitly called jealousy. If God is jealous herein, we should
be so, afraid of offering any worship to God otherwise than as he has
appointed in his word. \[2.\] The punishment of idolaters. God looks
upon them as haters of him, though they perhaps pretend love to him; he
will visit their iniquity, that is, he will very severely punish it, not
only as a breach of his law, but as an affront to his majesty, a
violation of the covenant, and a blow at the root of all religion. He
will visit it upon the children, that is, this being a sin for which
churches shall be unchurched and a bill of divorce given them, the
children shall be cast out of covenant and communion together with the
parents, as with the parents the children were at first taken in. Or he
will bring such judgments upon a people as shall be the total ruin of
families. If idolaters live to be old, so as to see their children of
the third or fourth generation, it shall be the vexation of their eyes,
and the breaking of their hearts, to see them fall by the sword, carried
captive, and enslaved. Nor is it an unrighteous thing with God (if the
parents died in their iniquity, and the children tread in their steps,
and keep up false worships, because they received them by tradition from
their fathers), when the measure is full, and God comes by his judgments
to reckon with them, to bring into the account the idolatries their
fathers were guilty of. Though he bear long with an idolatrous people,
he will not bear always, but by the fourth generation, at furthest, he
will begin to visit. Children are dear to their parents; therefore, to
deter men from idolatry, and to show how much God is displeased with it,
not only a brand of infamy is by it entailed upon families, but the
judgments of God may for it be executed upon the poor children when the
parents are dead and gone. \[3.\] The favour God would show to his
faithful worshippers: Keeping mercy for thousands of persons, thousands
of generations of those that love me, and keep my commandments. This
intimates that the second commandment, though, in the letter of it, it
is only a prohibition of false worships, yet includes a precept of
worshipping God in all those ordinances which he has instituted. As the
first commandment requires the inward worship of love, desire, joy,
hope, and admiration, so the second requires the outward worship of
prayer and praise, and solemn attendance on God's word. Note, First,
Those that truly love God will make it their constant care and endeavour
to keep his commandments, particularly those that relate to his worship.
Those that love God, and keep those commandments, shall receive grace to
keep his other commandments. Gospel worship will have a good influence
upon all manner of gospel obedience. Secondly, God has mercy in store
for such. Even they need mercy, and cannot plead merit; and mercy they
shall find with God, merciful protection in their obedience and a
merciful recompence of it. Thirdly, This mercy shall extend to
thousands, much further than the wrath threatened to those that hate
him, for that reaches but to the third or fourth generation. The streams
of mercy run now as full, as free, and as fresh, as ever.

3\. The third commandment concerns the manner of our worship, that it be
done with all possible reverence and seriousness, [Exo
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#007.md). We have here,

(1.) A strict prohibition: Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy
God in vain. It is supposed that, having taken Jehovah for their God,
they would make mention of his name (for thus all people will walk every
one in the name of his god); this command gives a needful caution not to
mention it in vain, and it is still as needful as ever. We take God's
name in vain, \[1.\] By hypocrisy, making a profession of God's name,
but not living up to that profession. Those that name the name of
Christ, but do not depart from iniquity, as that name binds them to do,
name it in vain; their worship is vain ([Mat
15:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#007).md), their oblations are vain
([Isa 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011.md), [Isa
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#013).md), their religion is vain, [Jam
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#026.md). \[2.\] By covenant-breaking; if
we make promises to God, binding our souls with those bonds to that
which is good, and yet perform not to the Lord our vows, we take his
name in vain ([Mat 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#033).md), it is folly,
and God has no pleasure in fools ([Ecc
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#004).md), nor will he be mocked, [Gal
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007.md). \[3.\] By rash swearing,
mentioning the name of God, or any of his attributes, in the form of an
oath, without any just occasion for it, or due application of mind to
it, but as a by-word, to no purpose at all, or to no good purpose.
\[4.\] By false swearing, which, some think, is chiefly intended in the
letter of the commandment; so it was expounded by those of old time.
Thou shalt not forswear thyself, [Mat
5:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#033.md). One part of the religious regard
the Jews were taught to pay to their God was to swear by his name, [Deu
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#020.md). But they affronted him, instead
of doing him honour, if they called him to be witness to a lie. \[5.\]
By using the name of God lightly and carelessly, and without any regard
to its awful significancy. The profanation of the forms of devotion is
forbidden, as well as the profanation of the forms of swearing; as also
the profanation of any of those things whereby God makes himself known,
his word, or any of his institutions; when they are either turned into
charms and spells, or into jest and sport, the name of God is taken in
vain.

(2.) A severe penalty: The Lord will not hold him guiltless;
magistrates, who punish other offences, may not think themselves
concerned to take notice of this, because it does not immediately offer
injury either to private property or the public peace; but God, who is
jealous for his honour, will not thus connive at it. The sinner may
perhaps hold himself guiltless, and think there is no harm in it, and
that God will never call him to an account for it. To obviate this
suggestion, the threatening is thus expressed, God will not hold him
guiltless, as he hopes he will; but more is implied, namely, that God
will himself be the avenger of those that take his name in vain, and
they will find it a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living
God.

4\. The fourth commandment concerns the time of worship. God is to be
served and honoured daily, but one day in seven is to be particularly
dedicated to his honour and spent in his service. Here is,

(1.) The command itself ([Exo 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#008).md):
Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy; and ([Exo
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#010).md), In it thou shalt do no manner
of work. It is taken for granted that the sabbath was instituted before;
we read of God's blessing and sanctifying a seventh day from the
beginning ([Gen 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#003).md), so that this was
not the enacting of a new law, but the reviving of an old law. \[1.\]
They are told what is the day they must religiously observe - a seventh,
after six days' labour; whether this was the seventh by computation from
the first seventh, or from the day of their coming out of Egypt, or
both, is not certain: now the precise day was notified to them ([Exo
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#023).md), and from this they were to
observe the seventh. \[2.\] How it must be observed. First, As a day of
rest; they were to do no manner of work on this day in their callings or
worldly business. Secondly, As a holy day, set apart to the honour of
the holy God, and to be spent in holy exercises. God, by blessing it,
had made it holy; they, by solemnly blessing him, must keep it holy, and
not alienate it to any other purpose than that for which the difference
between it and other days was instituted. \[3.\] Who must observe it:
Thou, and thy son, and thy daughter; the wife is not mentioned, because
she is supposed to be one with the husband and present with him, and, if
he sanctify the sabbath, it is taken for granted that she will join with
him; but the rest of the family are specified. Children and servants
must keep the sabbath, according to their age and capacity: in this, as
in other instances of religion, it is expected that masters of families
should take care, not only to serve the Lord themselves, but that their
houses also should serve him, at least that it may not be through their
neglect if they do not, [Jos 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#015.md).
Even the proselyted strangers must observe a difference between this day
and other days, which, if it laid some restraint upon them then, yet
proved a happy indication of God's gracious purpose, in process of time,
to bring the Gentiles into the church, that they might share in the
benefit of sabbaths. Compare [Isa
56:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#006.md), [Isa
56:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#007.md). God takes notice of what we do,
particularly what we do on sabbath days, though we should be where we
are strangers. \[4.\] A particular memorandum put upon this duty:
Remember it. It is intimated that the sabbath was instituted and
observed before; but in their bondage in Egypt they had lost their
computation, or were restrained by their task-masters, or, through a
great degeneracy and indifference in religion, they had let fall the
observance of it, and therefore it was requisite they should be reminded
of it. Note, Neglected duties remain duties still, notwithstanding our
neglect. It also intimates that we are both apt to forget it and
concerned to remember it. Some think it denotes the preparation we are
to make for the sabbath; we must think of it before it comes, that, when
it does come, we may keep it holy, and do the duty of it.

(2.) The reasons of this command. \[1.\] We have time enough for
ourselves in those six days, on the seventh day let us serve God; and
time enough to tire ourselves, on the seventh it will be a kindness to
us to be obliged to rest. \[2.\] This is God's day: it is the sabbath of
the Lord thy God, not only instituted by him, but consecrated to him. It
is sacrilege to alienate it; the sanctification of it is a debt. \[3.\]
It is designed for a memorial of the creation of the world, and
therefore to be observed to the glory of the Creator, as an engagement
upon ourselves to serve him and an encouragement to us to trust in him
who made heaven and earth. By the sanctification of the sabbath, the
Jews declared that they worshipped the God that made the world, and so
distinguished themselves from all other nations, who worshipped gods
which they themselves made. \[4.\] God has given us an example of rest,
after six days' work: he rested the seventh day, took a complacency in
himself, and rejoiced in the work of his hand, to teach us, on that day,
to take a complacency in him, and to give him the glory of his works,
[Psa 92:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#004.md). The sabbath began in the
finishing of the work of creation, so will the everlasting sabbath in
the finishing of the work of providence and redemption; and we observe
the weekly sabbath in expectation of that, as well as in remembrance of
the former, in both conforming ourselves to him we worship. \[5.\] He
has himself blessed the sabbath day and sanctified it. He has put an
honour upon it by setting it apart for himself; it is the holy of the
Lord and honourable: and he has put blessings into it, which he has
encouraged us to expect from him in the religious observance of that
day. It is the day which the Lord hath made, let not us do what we can
to unmake it. He has blessed, honoured, and sanctified it, let not us
profane it, dishonour it, and level that with common time which God's
blessing has thus dignified and distinguished.

[Exodus 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 20:12</span></span>

We have here the laws of the second table, as they are commonly called,
the last six of the ten commandments, comprehending our duty to
ourselves and to one another, and constituting a comment upon the second
great commandment, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. As religion
towards God is an essential branch of universal righteousness, so
righteousness towards men is an essential branch of true religion.
Godliness and honesty must go together.

I. The fifth commandment concerns the duties we owe to our relations;
those of children to their parents are alone specified: Honour thy
father and thy mother, which includes, 1. A decent respect to their
persons, an inward esteem of them outwardly expressed upon all occasions
in our conduct towards them. Fear them ([Lev
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#003).md), give them reverence, [Heb
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#009.md). The contrary to this is mocking
at them and despising them, [Pro
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#017.md). 2. Obedience to their lawful
commands; so it is expounded ([Eph
6:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001).md): "Children, obey your parents,
come when they call you, go where they send you, do what they bid you,
refrain from what they forbid you; and this, as children, cheerfully,
and from a principle of love." Though you have said, "We will not," yet
afterwards repent and obey, [Mat
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#029.md). 3. Submission to their rebukes,
instructions, and corrections; not only to the good and gentle, but also
to the froward, out of conscience towards God. 4. Disposing of
themselves with the advice, direction, and consent, of parents, not
alienating their property, but with their approbation. 5. Endeavouring,
in every thing, to be the comfort of their parents, and to make their
old age easy to them, maintaining them if they stand in need of support,
which our Saviour makes to be particularly intended in this commandment,
[Mat 15:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#004.md). The reason annexed to
this commandment is a promise: That thy days may be long in the land
which the Lord thy God giveth thee. Having mentioned, in the preface to
the commandments, has bringing them out of Egypt as a reason for their
obedience, he here, in the beginning of the second table, mentions his
bringing them into Canaan, as another reason; that good land they must
have upon their thoughts and in their eye, now that they were in the
wilderness. They must also remember, when they came to that land, that
they were upon their good behaviour, and that, if they did not conduct
themselves well, their days should be shortened in that land, both the
days of particular persons who should be cut off from it, and the days
of their nation which should be removed out of it. But here a long life
in that good land is promised particularly to obedient children. Those
that do their duty to their parents are most likely to have the comfort
of that which their parents gather for them and leave to them; those
that support their parents shall find that God, the common Father, will
support them. This promise is expounded ([Eph
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#003).md), That it may be well with thee,
and thou mayest live long on the earth. Those who, in conscience towards
God, keep this and the rest of God's commandments, may be sure that it
shall be well with them, and that they shall live as long on earth as
Infinite Wisdom sees good for them, and that what they may seem to be
cut short of on earth shall be abundantly made up in eternal life, the
heavenly Canaan which God will give them.

II\. The sixth commandment concerns our own and our neighbour's life
([Exo 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#013).md): "Thou shalt not kill;
thou shalt not do any thing hurtful or injurious to the health, ease,
and life, of thy own body, or any other person's unjustly." This is one
of the laws of nature, and was strongly enforced by the precepts given
to Noah and his sons, [Gen 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#005.md), [Gen
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006.md). It does not forbid killing in
lawful war, or in our own necessary defence, nor the magistrate's
putting offenders to death, for those things tend to the preserving of
life; but it forbids all malice and hatred to the person of any (for he
that hateth his brother is a murderer), and all personal revenge arising
therefrom; also all rash anger upon sudden provocations, and hurt said
or done, or aimed to be done, in passion: of this our Saviour expounds
this commandment, [Mat 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022.md). And, as
that which is worst of all, it forbids persecution, laying wait for the
blood of the innocent and excellent ones of the earth.

III\. The seventh commandment concerns our own and our neighbour's
chastity: Thou shalt not commit adultery, [Exo
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#014.md). This is put before the sixth by
our Saviour ([Mar 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#019).md): Do not
commit adultery, do not kill; for our chastity should be as dear to us
as our lives, and we should be as much afraid of that which defiles the
body as of that which destroys it. This commandment forbids all acts of
uncleanness, with all those fleshly lusts which produce those acts and
war against the soul, and all those practices which cherish and excite
those fleshly lusts, as looking, in order to lust, which, Christ tells
us, is forbidden in this commandment, [Mat
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#028.md).

IV\. The eighth commandment concerns our own and our neighbour's wealth,
estate, and goods: Thou shalt not steal, [Exo
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#015.md). Though God had lately allowed
and appointed them to spoil the Egyptians in a way of just reprisal, yet
he did not intend that it should be drawn into a precedent and that they
should be allowed thus to spoil one another. This command forbids us to
rob ourselves of what we have by sinful spending, or of the use and
comfort of it by sinful sparing, and to rob others by removing the
ancient landmarks, invading our neighbour's rights, taking his goods
from his person, or house, or field, forcibly or clandestinely,
over-reaching in bargains, nor restoring what is borrowed or found,
withholding just debts, rents, or wages, and (which is worst of all) to
rob the public in the coin or revenue, or that which is dedicated to the
service of religion.

V. The ninth commandment concerns our own and our neighbour's good name:
Thou shalt not bear false witness, [Exo
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#016.md). This forbids, 1. Speaking
falsely in any matter, lying, equivocating, and any way devising and
designing to deceive our neighbour. 2. Speaking unjustly against our
neighbour, to the prejudice of his reputation; and (which involves the
guilty of both), 3. Bearing false witness against him, laying to his
charge things that he knows not, either judicially, upon oath (by which
the third commandment, and the sixth of eighth, as well as this, are
broken), or extrajudicially, in common converse, slandering, backbiting,
tale-bearing, aggravating what is done amiss and making it worse than it
is, and any way endeavouring to raise our own reputation upon the ruin
of our neighbour's.

VI\. The tenth commandment strikes at the root: Thou shalt not covet,
[Exo 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#017.md). The foregoing commands
implicitly forbid all desire of doing that which will be an injury to
our neighbour; this forbids all inordinate desire of having that which
will be a gratification to ourselves. "O that such a man's house were
mine! Such a man's wife mine! Such a man's estate mine!" This is
certainly the language of discontent at our own lot, and envy at our
neighbour's; and these are the sins principally forbidden here. St.
Paul, when the grace of God caused the scales to fall from his eyes,
perceived that this law, Thou shalt not covet, forbade all those
irregular appetites and desires which are the first-born of the corrupt
nature, the first risings of the sin that dwelleth in us, and the
beginnings of all the sin that is committed by us: this is that lust
which, he says, he had not known the evil of, if this commandment, when
it came to his conscience in the power of it, had not shown it to him,
[Rom 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007.md). God give us all to see our
face in the glass of this law, and to lay our hearts under the
government of it!

[Exodus 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 20:18</span></span>

I. The extraordinary terror with which the law was given. Never was any
thing delivered with such awful pomp; every word was accented, and every
sentence paused, with thunder and lightning, much louder and brighter,
no doubt, than ordinary. And why was the law given in this dreadful
manner, and with all this tremendous ceremony? 1. It was designed (once
for all) to give a sensible discovery of the glorious majesty of God,
for the assistance of our faith concerning it, that, knowing the terror
of the Lord, we may be persuaded to live in his fear. 2. It was a
specimen of the terrors of the general judgment, in which sinners will
be called to an account for the breach of this law: the archangel's
trumpet will then sound an alarm, to give notice of the Judge's coming,
and a fire shall devour before him. 3. It was an indication of the
terror of those convictions which the law brings into conscience, to
prepare the soul for the comforts of the gospel. Thus was the law given
by Moses in such a way as might startle, affright, and humble men, that
the grace and truth which came by Jesus Christ might be the more
welcome. The apostle largely describes this instance of the terror of
that dispensation, as a foil to set off our privileges, as Christians,
in the light, liberty, and joy, of the New Testament dispensation, [Heb
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#018.md), etc.

II\. The impression which this made, for the present, upon the people;
they must have had stupid hearts indeed, if this had not affected them.
1. They removed, and stood afar off, [Exo
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#018.md). Before God began to speak, they
were thrusting forward to gaze ([Exo
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#021).md); but now they were effectually
cured of their presumption, and taught to keep their distance. 2. They
entreated that the word should not be so spoken to them any more ([Heb
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#019).md), but begged that God would
speak to them by Moses, [Exo 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#019.md).
Hereby they obliged themselves to acquiesce in the mediation of Moses,
they themselves nominating him as a fit person to deal between them and
God, and promising to hearken to him as to God's messenger; hereby also
they teach us to acquiesce in that method which Infinite Wisdom takes,
of speaking to us by men like ourselves, whose terror shall not make us
afraid, nor their hand be heavy upon us. Once God tried the expedient of
speaking to the children of men immediately, but it was found that they
could not bear it; it rather drove men from God than brought them to
him, and, as it proved in the issue, though it terrified them, it did
not deter them from idolatry, for soon after this they worshipped the
golden calf. Let us therefore rest satisfied with the instructions given
us by the scriptures and the ministry; for, if we believe not them,
neither should we be persuaded though God should speak to us in thunder
and lightning, as he did from Mount Sinai: here that matter was
determined.

III\. The encouragement Moses gave them, by explaining the design of God
in his terror ([Exo 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#020).md): Fear not,
that is, "Think not that the thunder and fire are designed to consume
you," which was the thing they feared ([Exo
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#019), lest we die.md); thunder and
lightning constituted one of the plagues of Egypt, but Moses would not
have them think they were sent to them on the same errand on which they
were sent to the Egyptians: no, they were intended, 1. To prove them, to
try how they would like dealing with God immediately, without a
mediator, and so to convince them how admirably well God had chosen for
them, in putting Moses into that office. Ever since Adam fled, upon
hearing God's voice in the garden, sinful man could not bear either to
speak to God or hear from him immediately. 2. To keep them to their
duty, and prevent their sinning against God. He encourages them, saying,
Fear not, and yet tells them that God thus spoke to them, that his fear
might be before their face. We must not fear with amazement - with that
fear which has torment, which only works upon the fancy for the present,
sets us a trembling, genders to bondage, betrays us to Satan, and
alienates us from God; but we must always have in our minds a reverence
of God's majesty, a dread of his displeasure, and an obedient regard to
his sovereign authority over us: this fear will quicken us to our duty
and make us circumspect in our walking. Thus stand in awe, and sin not,
[Psa 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#004.md).

IV\. The progress of their communion with God by the mediation of Moses,
[Exo 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#021.md). While the people continued
to stand afar off, conscious of guilt and afraid of God's wrath, Moses
drew near unto the thick darkness; he was made to draw near, so the word
is: Moses, of himself, durst not have ventured into the thick darkness,
if God had not called him, and encouraged him, and, as some of the
rabbies suppose, sent an angel to take him by the hand, and lead him up.
Thus it is said of the great Mediator, I will cause him to draw near
([Jer 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#021).md), and by him it is that we
also are introduced, [Eph 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#012.md).

[Exodus 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 20:22</span></span>

Moses having gone into the thick darkness, where God was, God there
spoke in his hearing only, privately and without terror, all that
follows hence to the end of ch. 23, which is mostly an exposition of the
ten commandments; and he was to transmit it by word of mouth first, and
afterwards in writing, to the people. The laws in these verses related
to God's worship.

I. They are here forbidden to make images for worship ([Exo
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#022.md), [Exo
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#023).md): You have seen that I have
talked with you from heaven (such was his wonderful condescension, much
more than for some mighty prince to talk familiarly with a company of
poor beggars); now you shall not make gods of silver.

1\. This repetition of the second commandment comes in here, either (1.)
As pointing to that which God had chiefly in view in giving them this
law in this manner, that is, their peculiar addictedness to idolatry,
and the peculiar sinfulness of that crime. Ten commandments God had
given them, but Moses is ordered to inculcate upon them especially the
first two. They must not forget any of them, but they must be sure to
remember those. Or, (2.) As pointing to that which might properly be
inferred from God's speaking to them as he had done. He had given them
sufficient demonstration of his presence among them; they needed not to
make images of him, as if he were absent. Besides, they had only seen
that he talked with them; they had seen no manner of similitude, so that
they could not make any image of God; and his manifesting himself to
them only by a voice plainly showed them that they must not make any
such image, but keep up their communion with God by his word, and not
otherwise.

2\. Two arguments are here hinted against image-worship: - (1.) That
thereby they would affront God, intimated in that, You shall not make
with me gods. Though they pretended to worship them but as
representations of God, yet really they made them rivals with God, which
he would not endure. (2.) That thereby they would abuse themselves,
intimated in that, "You shall not make unto you gods; while you think by
them to assist your devotion, you will really corrupt it, and put a
cheat upon yourselves." At first, it should seem, they made their images
for worship of gold and silver, pretending, by the richness of those
metals, to honour God, and, by the brightness of them, to affect
themselves with his glory; but, even in these, they changed the truth of
God into a lie, and so, by degrees, were justly given up to such strong
delusions as to worship images of wood or stone.

II\. They are here directed in making altars for worship: it is meant of
occasional altars, such as they reared now in the wilderness, before the
tabernacle was erected, and afterwards upon special emergencies, for
present use, such as Gideon built ([Jdg
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#024).md), Manoah ([Jdg
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#019).md), Samuel ([Sa1
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#017).md), and many others. We may
suppose, now that the people of Israel were, with this glorious
discovery which God had made of himself to them, that many of them would
incline, in this pang of devotion, to offer sacrifice to God; and, it
being necessary to a sacrifice that there be an alter, they are here
appointed,

1\. To make their altars very plain, either of earth or of unhewn stone,
[Exo 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#024.md), [Exo
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#025.md). That they might not be tempted
to think of a graven image, they must not so much as hew into shape the
stones that they made their altars of, but pile them up as they were, in
the rough. This rule being prescribed before the establishment of the
ceremonial law, which appointed altars much more costly, intimates that,
after the period of that law, plainness should be accepted as the best
ornament of the external services of religion, and that gospel-worship
should not be performed with external pomp and gaiety. The beauty of
holiness needs no paint, nor do those do any service to the spouse of
Christ that dress her in the attire of a harlot, as the church of Rome
does: an altar of earth does best.

2\. To make their altars very low ([Exo
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#026).md), so that they might not go up
by steps to them. That the higher the altar was, and the nearer heaven,
the more acceptable the sacrifice was, was a foolish fancy of the
heathen, who therefore chose high places; in opposition to this, and to
show that it is the elevation of the heart, not of the sacrifice, that
God looks at, they were here ordered to make their altars low. We may
suppose that the altars they reared in the wilderness, and other
occasional altars, were designed only for the sacrifice of one beast at
a time; but the altar in Solomon's temple, which was to be made much
longer and broader, that it might contain many sacrifices at once, was
made ten cubits high, that the height might bear a decent proportion to
the length and breadth; and to that it was requisite they should go up
by steps, which yet, no doubt, were so contrived as to prevent the
inconvenience here spoken of, the discovering of their nakedness
thereon.

III\. They are here assured of God's gracious acceptance of their
devotions, wherever they were paid according to his will ([Exo
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#024).md): In all places where I record
my name, or where my name is recorded (that is, where I am worshipped in
sincerity), I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee. Afterwards,
God chose one particular place wherein to record his name: but that
being taken away now under the gospel, when men are encouraged to pray
every where, this promise revives in its full extent, that, wherever
God's people meet in his name to worship him, he will be in the midst of
them, he will honour them with his presence, and reward them with the
gifts of his grace; there he will come unto them, and will bless them,
and more than this we need not desire for the beautifying of our solemn
assemblies.
