### [Ezekiel Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 32:0</span></span>

Still we are upon the destruction of Pharaoh and Egypt, which is
wonderfully enlarged upon, and with a great deal of emphasis. When we
read so very much of Egypt's ruin, no less than six several prophecies
at divers times delivered concerning it, we are ready to think, Surely
there is some special reason for it. And, I. Perhaps it may look as far
back as the book of Genesis, where we find ([Gen
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#014).md) that God determined to judge
Egypt for oppressing his people; and, though that was in part fulfilled
in the plagues of Egypt and the drowning of Pharaoh, yet, in this
destruction, here foretold, those old scores were reckoned for, and that
was to have its full accomplishment. II. Perhaps it may look as far
forward as the book of the Revelation, where we find that the great
enemy of the gospel-church, that makes war with the Lamb, is spiritually
called Egypt, [Rev 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008.md). And, if so,
the destruction of Egypt and its Pharaoh was a type of the destruction
of that proud enemy; and between this prophecy of the ruin of Egypt and
the prophecy of the destruction of the antichristian generation there is
some analogy. We have two distinct prophecies in this chapter relating
to Egypt, both in the same month, one on the 1st day, the other that day
fortnight, probably both on the sabbath day. They are both lamentations,
not only to signify how lamentable the fall of Egypt should be, but to
intimate how much the prophet himself should lament it, from a generous
principle of love to mankind. The destruction of Egypt is here
represented under two similitudes: - 1. The killing of a lion, or a
whale, or some such devouring creature (v. 1-16). 2. The funeral of a
great commander or captain-general (v. 17-32). The two prophecies of
this chapter are much of the same length.

[Ezekiel 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 32:1</span></span>

Here, I. The prophet is ordered to take up a lamentation for Pharaoh
king of Egypt, [Eze 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002.md). It concerns
ministers to be much of a serious spirit, and, in order thereunto, to be
frequent in taking up lamentations for the fall and ruin of sinners, as
those that have not desired, but dreaded, the woeful day. Note,
Ministers that would affect others with the things of God must make it
appear that they are themselves affected with the miseries which sinners
bring upon themselves by their sins. It becomes us to weep and tremble
for those that will not weep and tremble for themselves, to try if
thereby we may set them a weeping, set them a trembling.

II\. He is ordered to show cause for that lamentation.

1\. Pharaoh has been a troubler of the nations, even of his own nation,
which he should have procured the repose of: He is like a young lion of
the nations ([Eze 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002).md), loud and
noisy, hectoring and threatening as a lion when he roars. Great
potentates, if they by tyrannical and oppressive, are in God's account
no better than beasts of prey. He is like a whale, or dragon, like a
crocodile (so some) in the seas, very turbulent and vexatious, as the
leviathan that makes the deep to boil like a pot, [Job
41:31](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#031.md). When Pharaoh engaged in an
unnecessary war with the Cyrenians he came forth with his rivers, with
his armies, troubled the waters, disturbed his own kingdom and the
neighbouring nations, fouled the rivers, and made them muddy. Note, A
great deal of disquiet is often given to the world by the restless
ambition and implacable resentments of proud princes. Ahab is he that
troubles Israel, and not Elijah.

2\. He that has troubled others must expect to be himself troubled; for
the Lord is righteous, [Jos 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#025.md).

(1.) This is set forth here by a comparison. Is Pharaoh like a great
whale, which, when it comes up the river, gives great disturbance, a
leviathan which Job cannot draw out with a hook? ([Job
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001).md), yet God has a net for him which
is large enough to enclose him and strong enough to secure him ([Eze
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#003).md): I will spread my net over thee,
even the army of the Chaldeans, a company of many people; they shall
force him out of his fastnesses, dislodge him out of his possessions,
throw him like a great fish upon dry ground, upon the open field ([Eze
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#004).md), where being out of his element,
he must die of course, and be a prey to the birds and beasts, as was
foretold, [Eze 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#005.md). What can the
strongest fish do to help itself when it is out of the water and lies
gasping? The flesh of this great whale shall be laid upon the mountains
([Eze 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#005).md) and the valleys shall be
filled with his height. Such numbers of Pharaoh's soldiers shall be
slain that the dead bodies shall be scattered upon the hills and there
shall be heaps of them piled up in the valleys. Blood shall be shed in
such abundance as to swell the rivers in the valleys. Or, Such shall be
the bulk, such the height, of this leviathan, that, when he is laid upon
the ground, he shall fill a valley. Such vast quantities of blood shall
issue from this leviathan as shall water the land of Egypt, the land
wherein now he swims, now he sports himself, [Eze
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#006.md). It shall reach to the mountains,
and the waters of Egypt shall again be turned into blood by this means:
The rivers shall be full of thee. The judgments executed upon Pharaoh of
old are expressed by the breaking of the heads of leviathan in the
waters, [Psa 74:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#013.md), [Psa
74:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#014.md). But now they go further; this
old serpent not only has now his head bruised, but is all crushed to
pieces.

(2.) It is set forth by a prophecy of the deep impression which the
destruction of Egypt should make upon the neighbouring nations; it would
put them all into a consternation, as the fall of the Assyrian monarchy
did, [Eze 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#015.md), [Eze
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#016.md). When Pharaoh, who had been like
a blazing burning torch, is put out and extinguished it shall make all
about him look black, [Eze 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#007.md). The
heavens shall be hung with black, the stars darkened, the sun eclipsed,
and the moon be deprived of her borrowed light. It is from the upper
world that this lower receives its light; and therefore ([Eze
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#008).md), when the bright lights of
heaven are made dark above, darkness by consequence is set upon the
land, upon the earth; so it shall be on the land of Egypt. Here the
plague of darkness, which was upon Egypt of old for three days, seems to
be alluded to, as, before, the turning of the waters into blood. For,
when former judgments are forgotten, it is just that they should be
repeated. When their privy-counsellors, and statesmen, and those that
have the direction of the public affairs, are deprived of wisdom and
made fools, and the things that belong to their peace are hidden from
their eyes, then their lights are darkened and the land is in a mist.
This is foretold, [Isa 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#013.md). The
princes of Zoan have become fools. Now upon the spreading of the report
of the fall of Egypt, and the bringing of the news to remote countries,
countries which they had not known ([Eze
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#009).md), people shall be much affected,
and shall feel themselves sensibly touched by it. \[1.\] It shall fill
them with vexation to see such an ancient, wealthy, potent kingdom thus
humbled and brought down, and the pride of worldly glory, which they
have such a value for, stained. The hearts of many people will be vexed
to see the word of the God of Israel fulfilled in the destruction of
Egypt, and that all the gods of Egypt were not able to relieve it. Note,
The destruction of some wicked people is a vexation to others. \[2.\] It
shall fill them with admiration ([Eze
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#010).md): They shall be amazed at thee,
shall wonder to see such great riches and power come to nothing, [Rev
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#017.md). Note, Those that admire with
complacency the pomp of this world will admire with consternation the
ruin of that pomp, which to those that know the vanity of all things
here below is no surprise at all. \[3.\] It shall fill them with fear:
even their kings (that think it their prerogative to be secure) shall be
horribly afraid for thee, concluding their own house to be in danger
when their neighbour's is on fire. When I shall brandish my sword before
them they shall tremble every man for his own life. Note, When the sword
of God's justice is drawn against some, to cut them off, it is thereby
brandished before others, to give them warning. And those that will not
be admonished by it, and made to reform, shall yet be frightened by it,
and made to tremble. They shall tremble at every moment, because of thy
fall. When others are ruined by sin we have reason to quake for fear, as
knowing ourselves guilty and obnoxious. Who is able to stand before this
holy Lord God?

(3.) It is set forth by a plain and express prediction of the desolation
itself that should come upon Egypt. \[1.\] The instruments of the
desolation appear here very formidable. It is the sword of the king of
Babylon, that warlike, that victorious prince, that shall come upon thee
([Eze 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#011).md), the swords of the
mighty, even the terrible of the nations, all of them ([Eze
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#012).md), an army that there is no
standing before. Note, Those that delight in war, and are upon all
occasions entering into contention, may expect, some time or other, to
be engaged with those that will prove too hard for them. Pharaoh had
been forward to quarrel with his neighbour and to come forth with his
rivers, with his armies, [Eze 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002.md).
But God will now give him enough of it. \[2.\] The instances of the
desolation appear here very frightful, much the same with what we had
before, [Eze 29:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#010.md); [Eze
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#007.md). First, The multitude of Egypt
shall be destroyed, not decimated, some picked out to be made examples,
but all cut off. Note, The numbers of sinners, though they be a
multitude, will neither secure them against God's power nor entitle them
to his pity. Secondly, The pomp of Egypt shall be spoiled, the pomp of
their court, what they have been proud of. Note, in renouncing the pomps
of this world we did ourselves a great kindness, for they are things
that are soon spoiled and that cheat their admirers. Thirdly, The cattle
of Egypt, that used to feed by the rivers, shall be destroyed ([Eze
32:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#013).md), either cut off by the sword or
carried off for a prey. Egypt was famous for horses, which would be an
acceptable booty to the Chaldeans. The rivers shall be no more
frequented as they have been by man and beast, that came thither to
drink. Fourthly, The waters of Egypt, that used to flow briskly, shall
now grow deep, and slow, and heavy, and shall run like oil ([Eze
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#014).md), a figurative expression
signifying that there should be such universal sadness and heaviness
upon the whole nation that even the rivers should go softly and silently
like mourners, and quite forget their rapid motion. Fifthly, The whole
country of Egypt shall be stripped of its wealth; it shall be destitute
of what whereof it was full ([Eze
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#015).md), corn, and cattle, and all the
pleasant fruits of the earth; when those are smitten that dwell therein
the ground is untilled, and that which is gathered becomes an easy prey
to the invader. Note, God can soon empty those of this world's goods
that have the greatest fulness of those things and are full of them,
that enjoy most and have their hearts set upon those enjoyments. The
Egyptians were full of their pleasant and plentiful country, and its
rich productions. Every one that talked with them might perceive how
much it filled them. But God can soon make their country destitute of
that whereof it is full; it is therefore our wisdom to be full of
treasures in heaven. When the country is made destitute, 1. It shall be
an instruction to them: Then shall they know that I am the Lord. A
sensible conviction of the vanity of the world, and the fading perishing
nature of all things in it, will contribute much to our right knowledge
of God as our portion and happiness. 2. It shall be a lamentation to all
about them: The daughters of the nations shall lament her ([Eze
32:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#016).md), either because, being in
alliance with her, they share in her grievances and suffer with her, or,
being admirers of her, they at least share in her grief and sympathize
with her. They shall lament for Egypt and all her multitude; it shall
excite their pity to see so great a devastation made. By enlarging the
matters of our joy we increase the occasions of our sorrow.

[Ezekiel 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 32:17</span></span>

This prophecy concludes and completes the burden of Egypt, and leaves it
and all its multitude in the pit of destruction.

I. We are here invited to attend the funeral of that once flourishing
kingdom, to lament its fall, and to take a view of those who attend it
to the grave and accompany it in the grave.

1\. This dead corpse of a kingdom is here brought to the grave. The
prophet is ordered to cast them down to the pit ([Eze
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#018).md), to foretel their destruction
as one that had authority, as Jeremiah was set over the kingdoms, [Jer
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010.md). He must speak in God's name, and
as from him who will cast them down. Yet he must foretel it as one that
had an affectionate concern for them; he must wail for the multitude of
Egypt, even when he casts them down. When Egypt is slain, let her have
an honourable funeral, befitting her quality; let her be buried with the
daughters of the famous nations, in their burying-places and with the
same ceremony. It is but a poor allay to the reproach and terror of
death to be buried with those that were famous; yet this is all that is
allowed to Egypt. Shall Egypt think to exempt herself from the common
fate of proud and imperious nations? No; she must take her lot with them
([Eze 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#019).md): "Whom dost thou surpass
in beauty? Art thou so much fairer than any other nation that thou
shouldst expect therefore to be excused? No; others as fair as thou have
sunk into the pit; go down therefore, and be thou laid with the
uncircumcised. Thou art like them and art likely to lie among them. The
multitude of Egypt shall all fall in the midst of those that are slain
with the sword, now that there is a general slaughter made among the
nations." Egypt with the rest must drink of the bloody cup, and
therefore she is delivered to the sword, to the sword of war (but, in
God's hand, the sword of justice), is delivered to be publicly executed.
Draw her and all her multitude; draw them either as the dead bodies of
great men are drawn in honour to the grave, in a hearse, or as
malefactors are drawn in disgrace to the place of execution, on a
sledge; draw them to the pit, and let them be made a spectacle to the
world.

2\. This corpse of a kingdom is bid welcome to the grave, and Pharaoh is
made free of the congregation of the dead, and admitted into their
regions, not without some pomp and ceremony. As the surprising fall of
the king of Babylon is thus illustrated, Hell from beneath is moved for
thee to meet thee at thy coming, and to introduce thee into those
mansions of darkness ([Isa 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009.md),
etc.), so here ([Eze 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#021).md), They
shall speak to him out of the midst of hell, as it were congratulating
his arrival and calling him to join with them in acknowledging that
which neither he nor they would be brought to own when they were in
their pomp and pride, that it is in vain to think of contesting with
God, and none ever hardened their hearts against him and prospered. They
shall say to him, and to those that pretended to help him, Where are you
now? What have you brought your attempts to at last? Divers nations are
here mentioned as gone down to the grave before Egypt that are ready to
give her a scornful reception and upbraid her with coming to them at
last. These nations here spoken of were probably such as had been of
late years ruined and wasted by the king of Babylon, and their princes
cut off; let Egypt know that she has neighbour's fare. When she goes to
the grave she does but migrare ad plures - migrate to the majority;
there are innumerable before her. But it is observable that though Judah
and Jerusalem were just about this time, or a little before, utterly
ruined and laid waste, yet they are not mentioned here among the nations
that welcome Egypt to the pit; for though they suffered the same things
that these nations suffered, and by the same hand, yet the kind
intentions of their affliction, and its happy issue at last, and the
mercy God had yet in reserve for them, altered the property of it; it
was not to them a going down to the pit, as it was to the heathen; they
were not smitten as others were, nor slain according to the slaughter of
other nations, [Isa 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#007.md). But let us
see who those are that have gone to the grave before Egypt, that lie
uncircumcised, slain by the sword, with whom she must now take up her
lodging. (1.) There lie the Assyrian empire, and all the princes and
mighty men of that monarchy ([Eze
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#022).md): Asshur is there and all her
company, all the countries that were tributaries to and had dependence
upon that crown. That mighty potentate who used to lie in state, with
his guards and grandees about him, now lies in obscurity, with his
graves about him and his soldiers in them, unable any longer to do him
service or honour; they are all of them slain, fallen by the sword. The
number of their months was cut off in the midst, and, being bloody and
deceitful men, they were not suffered to live out half their days. Their
braves were set in the sides of the pit, all in a row, like beds in a
common chamber, [Eze 32:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#023.md). All their
company is such as were slain, fallen by the sword; a vast congregation
there is of such, who had caused terror in the land of the living. But
as the death of those to whom they were a terror put an end to their
fears (in the grave the prisoners rest together and hear not the voice
of the oppressor, [Job 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#018).md), so the
death of these mighty men puts an end to their terrors. Who is afraid of
a dead lion? Note, Death will be a king of terrors to those who, instead
of making themselves blessings, make themselves terrors, in their
generation. (2.) There lies the kingdom of Persia, which perhaps within
the memory of man at that time had been wasted and brought down: There
is Elam and all her multitude, the king of Elam and his numerous armies,
[Eze 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#024.md), [Eze
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#025.md). They also had caused their
terror in the land of the living, had made a fearful noise and bluster
among the nations in their day. But Elam has now a grave by herself, and
the graves of the common people round about her, fallen by the sword;
she has her bed in the midst of the slain that went down uncircumcised,
unsanctified, unholy, and not in covenant with God. They have borne
their shame with those that go down to the pit; they have fallen under
the common disgrace and mortification of mankind, that they die and are
buried; nay, they die under particular marks of ignominy, which God and
man put upon them. Note, Those who cause their terror shall, sooner or
later, bear their shame, and be made a terror to themselves. The king of
Elam is put in the midst of those that are slain. All the honour he can
now pretend to is to be buried in the chief sepulchre. (3.) There lies
the Scythian power, which, about this time, was busy in the world.
Meshech and Tubal, those barbarous northern nations, had lately made a
descent upon the Medes, and caused their terror among them, lived among
them upon free quarter for some years, making every thing their own that
they could lay their hands on; but at length Cyaxares, king of the
Medes, drew them by a wile into his power, but off abundance of them,
and obliged them to quit his country, [Eze
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#026.md). There lie Meshech and Tubal,
and all their multitude; there is a burying place for them, with their
chief commander in the midst of them, all of them uncircumcised, slain
by the sword. These Scythians, dying ingloriously as they lived, are not
laid, as the other nations spoken of before, in the bed of honour ([Eze
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#027).md): They shall not lie with the
mighty, shall not be buried in state, as those are, even by consent of
the enemy, that are slain in the field of battle, that go down to their
graves with their weapons of war carried before the hearse, or trailed
after it, that have particularly their swords laid under their heads, as
if they could sleep the sweeter in the grave when they laid their heads
on such a pillow. These Scythians are not buried with these marks of
honour, but their iniquities shall be upon their sons; they shall, for
their iniquity, be left unburied, though they were the terror even of
the mighty in the land of the living. (4.) There lies the kingdom of
Edom, which had flourished long, but about this time, at least before
the destruction of Egypt, was made quite desolate, as was foretold, [Eze
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#013.md). Among the sepulchres of the
nations there is Edom, [Eze 32:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#029.md).
There lie, not dignified with monuments or inscriptions, but mingled
with common dust, her kings and all her princes, her wise statesmen
(which Edom was famous for), and her brave soldiers. These with their
might are laid by those that were slain by the sword; their might could
not prevent it, nay, their might helped to procure it, for that both
encouraged them to engage in war and incensed their neighbours against
them, who thought it necessary to curb their growing greatness. A great
deal of pains they took to ruin themselves, as many do, who with their
might, with all their might, are laid by those that were slain with the
sword. The Edomites retained circumcision, being of the seed of Abraham.
But that shall stand them in no stead; they shall lie with the
uncircumcised. (5.) There lie the princes of the north, and all the
Zidonians. These were as well acquainted with maritime affairs as the
Egyptians were, who relied much upon that part of their strength, but
they have gone down with the slain ([Eze
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#030).md), down to the pit. Now they are
ashamed of their might, ashamed to think how much they boasted of it and
trusted to it; and, as the Edomites with their might, so these with
their terror, are laid with those that are slain by the sword and are
forced to take their lot with them. They bear their shame with those
that go down to the pit, die in as much disgrace as those that are cut
off by the hand of public justice. (6.) All this is applied to Pharaoh
and the Egyptians, who have no reason to flatter themselves with hopes
of tranquillity when they see how the wisest, and wealthiest, and
strongest, of their neighbours have been laid waste ([Eze
32:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#028).md): "Yea, thou shalt be broken in
the midst of the uncircumcised; when God is pulling down the unhumbled
and unreformed nations thou must expect to come down with them." \[1.\]
It will be some extenuation of the miseries of Egypt to observe that it
has been the case of so many great and mighty nations before ([Eze
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#031).md): Pharaoh shall see them and be
comforted; it will be some ease to his mind that he is not the first
king that has been slain in battle - his not the first army that has
been routed, his not the first kingdom that has been made desolate. Mr.
Greenhill observes here, "The comfort which wicked ones have after death
is poor comfort, not real, but imaginary." They will find little
satisfaction in having so many fellow-sufferers; the rich man in hell
dreaded it. It is only in point of honour that Pharaoh can see and be
comforted. \[2.\] But nothing will be an exemption from these miseries;
for ([Eze 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#032).md) I have caused my
terror in the land of the living. Great men have caused their terror,
have studied how to make every body fear them. Oderint dum metuant - Let
them hate, so that they do but fear. But now the great God has caused
his terror in the land of the living; and therefore he laughs at theirs,
because he sees that his day is coming, [Psa
37:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#013.md). In this day of terror Pharaoh
and all his multitude shall be laid with those that are slain by the
sword.

II\. The view which this prophecy gives us of ruined states may show us
something, 1. Of this present world, and the empire of death in it.
Come, and see the calamitous state of human life; see what a dying world
this is. The strong die, the mighty die, Pharaoh and all his multitude.
See what a killing world this is. They are all slain with the sword. As
if men did not die fast enough of themselves, men are ingenious at
finding out ways to destroy one another. It is not only a great pit, but
a great cock-pit. 2. Of the other world. Though it is the destruction of
nations as such that perhaps is principally intended here, yet here is a
plain allusion to the final and everlasting ruin of impenitent sinners,
of those that are uncircumcised in heart; they are slain by the sword of
divine justice; their iniquity is upon them, and with it they bear their
shame. Those, Christ's enemies, that would not have him to reign over
them, shall be brought forth and slain before him, though they be as
pompous, though they be as numerous, as Pharaoh and all his multitude.
