### [Job Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 36:0</span></span>

Elihu, having largely reproved Job for some of his unadvised speeches,
which Job had nothing to say in the vindication of, here comes more
generally to set him to rights in his notions of God's dealings with
him. His other friends had stood to it that, because he was a wicked
man, therefore his afflictions were so great and so long. But Elihu only
maintained that the affliction was sent for his trial, and that
therefore it was lengthened out because Job was not, as yet, thoroughly
humbled under it, nor had duly accommodated himself to it. He urges many
reasons, taken from the wisdom and righteousness of God, his care of his
people, and especially his greatness and almighty power, with which, in
this and the following chapter, he persuades him to submit to the hand
of God. Here we have, I. His preface, ([Job
36:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#002).md). II. The account he gives of
the methods of God's providence towards the children of men, according
as they conduct themselves ([Job
36:5-15](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#005).md). III. The fair warning and
good counsel he gives to Job thereupon ([Job
36:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#016).md). IV. His demonstration of
God's sovereignty and omnipotence, which he gives instances of in the
operations of common providence, and which is a reason why we should all
submit to him in his dealings with us ([Job
36:22-33](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#022).md). This he prosecutes and
enlarges upon in the following chapter.

[Job 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 36:1</span></span>

Once more Elihu begs the patience of the auditory, and Job's
particularly, for he has not said all that he has to say, but he will
not detain them long. Stand about me a little (so some read it), [Job
36:2](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#002.md). "Let me have your attendance,
your attention, awhile longer, and I will speak but this once, as
plainly and as much to the purpose as I can." To gain this he pleads, 1.
That he had a good cause, and a noble and very fruitful subject: I have
yet to speak on God's behalf. He spoke as an advocate for God, and
therefore might justly expect the ear of the court. Some indeed pretend
to speak on God's behalf who really speak for themselves; but those who
sincerely appear in the cause of God, and speak in behalf of his honour,
his truths, his ways, his people, shall be sure neither to want
instructions (it shall be given them in that same hour what they shall
speak) nor to lose their cause or their fee. Nor need they fear lest
they should exhaust their subject. Those that have spoken ever so much
may yet find more to be spoken on God's behalf. 2. That he had something
to offer that was uncommon, and out of the road of vulgar observation: I
will fetch my knowledge from afar ([Job
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#003).md), that is, "we will have recourse
to our first principles and the highest notions we can make use of to
serve any purpose." It is worth while to go far for this knowledge of
God, to dig for it, to travel for it; it will recompense our pains, and,
though far-fetched, is not dear-bought. 3. That his design was
undeniably honest; for all he aimed at was to ascribe righteousness to
his Maker, to maintain and clear this truth, that God is righteous in
all his ways. In speaking of God, and speaking for him, it is good to
remember that he is our Maker, to call him so, and therefore to be ready
to do him and the interests of his kingdom the best service we can. If
he be our Maker, we have our all from him, must use our all for him, and
be very jealous for his honour. That his management should be very just
and fair ([Job 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#004).md): "My words shall
not be false, neither disagreeable to the thing itself nor to my own
thoughts and apprehensions. It is truth that I am contending for, and
that for truth's sake, with all possible sincerity and plainness." He
will make use of plain and solid arguments and not the subtleties and
niceties of the schools. "He who is perfect or upright in knowledge is
now reasoning with thee; and therefore let him not only have a fair
hearing, but let what he says be taken in good part, as meant well." The
perfection of our knowledge in this world is to be honest and sincere in
searching out truth, in applying it to ourselves, and in making use of
what we know for the good of others.

[Job 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 36:5</span></span>

Elihu, being to speak on God's behalf, and particularly to ascribe
righteousness to his Maker, here shows that the disposals of divine
Providence are all, not only according to the eternal counsels of his
will, but according to the eternal rules of equity. God acts as a
righteous governor, for,

I. He does not think it below him to take notice of the meanest of his
subjects, nor does poverty or obscurity set any at a distance from his
favour. If men are mighty, they are apt to look with a haughty disdain
upon those that are not of distinction and make no figure; but God is
mighty, infinitely so, and yet he despises not any, [Job
36:5](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#005.md). He humbles himself to take
cognizance of the affairs of the meanest, to do them justice and to show
them kindness. Job thought himself and his cause slighted because God
did not immediately appear for him. "No," says Elihu, God despises not
any, which is a good reason why we should honour all men. He is mighty
in strength and wisdom, and yet does not look with contempt upon those
that have but a little strength and wisdom, if they but mean honestly.
Nay, for this reason he despises not any, because his wisdom and
strength are incontestably infinite and therefore the condescensions of
his grace can be no diminution to him. Those that are wise and good will
not look upon any with scorn and disdain.

II\. He gives no countenance to the greatest, if they be bad ([Job
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#006).md): He preserves not the life of
the wicked. Though their life may be prolonged, yet not under any
special care of the divine Providence, but only its common protection.
Job had said that the wicked live, become old, and are mighty in power,
[Job 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#007.md). "No," says Elihu: "he
seldom suffers wicked men to become old. He preserves not their life so
long as they expected, nor with that comfort and satisfaction which are
indeed our life; and their preservation is but a reservation for the day
of wrath," [Rom 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005.md).

III\. He is always ready to right those that are any way injured, and to
plead their cause ([Job 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#006).md): He
gives right to the poor, avenges their quarrel upon their persecutors
and forces them to make restitution of what they have robbed them of. If
men will not right the injured poor, God will.

IV\. He takes a particular care for the protection of his good subjects,
[Job 36:7](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#007.md). He not only looks on them,
but he never looks off them: He withdraws not his eyes from the
righteous. Though they may seem sometimes neglected and forgotten, and
that befals them which looks like an oversight of Providence, yet tender
careful eye of their heavenly Father never withdraws from them. If our
eye be ever towards God in duty, his eye will be ever upon us in mercy,
and, when we are at the lowest, will not overlook us.

1\. Sometimes he prefers good people to places of trust and honour ([Job
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#007).md): With kings are they on the
throne, and every sheaf is made to bow to theirs. When righteous persons
are advanced to places of honour and power, it is in mercy to them; for
God's grace in them will both arm them against the temptations that
attend preferment and enable them to improve the opportunity it gives
them of doing good. It is also in mercy to those over whom they are set:
When the righteous bear rule the city rejoices. If the righteous be
advanced, they are established. Those that in honour keep a good
conscience stand upon sure ground, and high places are not such slippery
ground to them as they are to others. But, because it is not often that
we see good men made great men in this world, this may be supposed to
refer to the honour to which the righteous shall rise when their
Redeemer shall stand at the latter day upon the earth; for then only
they shall be exalted for ever, and established for ever; then shall
they all shine forth as the sun, and be made kings and priests to our
God.

2\. If at any time he bring them into affliction, it is for the good of
their souls, [Job 36:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#008.md). Some good
people are preferred to honour and power, but others are in trouble. Now
observe, (1.) The distress supposed ([Job
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#008).md): If they be bound in fetters,
laid in prison as Joseph was, or holden in the cords of any other
affliction, confined by pain and sickness, hampered by poverty, bound in
their counsels, and, notwithstanding all their struggles, held long in
this distress. This was Job's case; he was caught, and kept fast, in the
cords of anguish (as some read it); but observe, (2.) The design God
has, in bringing his people into such distresses as these; it is for the
benefit of their souls, the consideration of which should reconcile us
to affliction and make us think well of it. Three things God intends
when he afflicts us: - \[1.\] To discover past sins to us, and to bring
them to our remembrance. Then he shows them that amiss in them which
before they did not see. He discovers to them the fact of sin: He shows
them their work. Sin is our own work. If there be any good in us, it is
God's work; and we are concerned to see what work we have made by sin.
He discovers the fault of sin, shows them their transgressions of the
law of God, and withal the sinfulness of sin, that they have exceeded,
and have been beyond measure sinful. True penitents lay a load upon
themselves, do not extenuate, but aggravate, their sins, and own that
they have exceeded in them. Affliction sometimes answers to the sin; it
serves, however, to awaken the conscience and puts men upon considering.
\[2.\] To dispose our hearts to receive present instructions: Then he
opens their ear to discipline, [Job
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#010.md). Whom God chastens he teaches
([Psa 94:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#012).md), and the affliction makes
people willing to learn, softens the wax, that it may receive the
impression of the seal; yet it does not do this of itself, but the grace
of God working with and by it; it is he that opens the ear, that opens
the heart, who has the key of David. \[3.\] To deter and draw us off
from iniquity for the future. This is the errand on which the affliction
is sent; it is a command to return from iniquity, to have no more to do
with sin, to turn from it with an aversion to it and a resolution never
to return to it any more, [Hos 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#008.md).

3\. If the affliction do its work, and accomplish that for which it is
sent, he will comfort them again, according to the time that he has
afflicted them ([Job 36:11](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#011).md): If they
obey and serve him, - if they comply with his design and serve his
purpose in these dispensations, - if, when the affliction is removed,
they continue in the same good mind that they were in when they were
under the smart of it and perform the vows they made then, - if they
live in obedience to God's commands, particularly those which relate to
his service and worship, and in all instances make conscience of their
duty to him, - then they shall spend their days in prosperity again and
their years in true pleasures. Piety is the only sure way to prosperity
and pleasure; this is a certain truth, and yet few will believe it. If
we faithfully serve God, (1.) We have the promise of outward prosperity,
the promise of the life that now is, and the comforts of it, as far as
is for God's glory and our good; and who would desire them any further?
(2.) We have the possession of inward pleasures, the comfort of
communion with God and a good conscience, and that great peace which
those have that love God's law. If we rejoice not in the Lord always,
and in hope of eternal life, it is our own fault; and what better
pleasures can we spend our years in?

4\. If the affliction do not do its work, let them expect the furnace to
be heated seven times hotter till they are consumed ([Job
36:12](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#012).md): If they obey not, if they are
not bettered by their afflictions, are not reclaimed and reformed, they
shall perish by the sword of God's wrath. Those whom his rod does not
cure his sword will kill; and the consuming fire will prevail if the
refining fire do not; for when God judges he will overcome. If Ahaz, in
his distress, trespass yet more against the Lord, this is that king Ahaz
that is marked for ruin, [Ch2 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#022.md);
[Jer 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#029.md), [Jer
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#030.md). God would have instructed them
by their afflictions, but they received not instruction, would not take
the hints that were given them; and therefore they shall die without
knowledge, ere they are aware, without any further previous notices
given them; or they shall die because they were without knowledge
notwithstanding the means of knowledge which they were blessed with.
Those that die without knowledge die without grace and are undone for
ever.

V. He brings ruin upon hypocrites, the secret enemies of his kingdom
(such as Elihu described, [Job 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#012).md),
who, though they were numbered among the righteous whom Elihu had spoken
of before, yet did not obey God, but, being children of disobedience and
darkness, become children of wrath and perdition; these are the
hypocrites in heart, who heap up wrath, [Job
36:13](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#013.md). See the nature of hypocrisy: it
lies in the heart, which is for the world and the flesh when the outside
seems to be for God and religion. Many that are saints in show and
saints in word are hypocrites in heart. That spring is corrupt, and
there is an evil treasure there. See the mischievousness of hypocrisy:
hypocrites heap up wrath. They are doing that every day which is
provoking to God, and will be reckoned with for it all together in the
great day. They treasure up wrath against the day of wrath, [Rom
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005.md). Their sins are laid up in store
with God among his treasures, [Deu
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#034.md). Compare [Jam
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#003.md). As what goes up a vapour comes
down a shower, so what goes up sin, if not repented of, will come down
wrath. They think they are heaping up wealth, heaping up merits, but,
when the treasures are opened, it will prove they were heaping up wrath.
Observe, 1. What they do to heap up wrath. What is it that is so
provoking? It is this, They cry not when he binds them, that is, when
they are in affliction, bound with the cords of trouble, their hearts
are hardened, they are stubborn and unhumbled, and will not cry to God
nor make their application to him. They are stupid and senseless as
stocks and stones, despising the chastening of the Lord. 2. What are the
effects of that wrath? They die in youth, and their life is among the
unclean, [Job 36:14](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#014.md). This is the
portion of hypocrites, whom Christ denounced many woes against. If they
continue impenitent, (1.) They shall die a sudden death, die in youth,
when death is most a surprise, and death (that is, the consequence of
it) is always such to hypocrites; as those that die in youth die when
they hoped to live, so hypocrites, at death, go to hell, when they hoped
to go to heaven. When a wicked man dies his expectations shall perish.
(2.) They shall die the second death. Their life, after death (for so it
comes in here), is among the unclean, among the fornicators (so some),
among the worst and vilest of sinners, notwithstanding their specious
and plausible profession. It is among the Sodomites (so the margin),
those filthy wretches, who going after strange flesh, are set forth for
an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire, [Jde
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007.md). The souls of the wicked live
after death, but they live among the unclean, the unclean spirits, the
devil and his angels, forever separated from the new Jerusalem, into
which no unclean thing shall enter.

[Job 36:15](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 36:15</span></span>

Elihu here comes more closely to Job; and,

I. He tells him what God would have done for him before this if he had
been duly humbled under his affliction. "We all know how ready God is to
deliver the poor in his affliction ([Job
36:15](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#015).md); he always was so. The poor in
spirit, those that are of a broken and contrite heart, he looks upon
with tenderness, and, when they are in affliction, is ready to help
them. He opens their ears, and makes them to hear joy and gladness, even
in their oppressions; while he does not yet deliver them he speaks to
them good words and comfortable words, for the encouragement of their
faith and patience, the silencing of their fears, and the balancing of
their griefs; and even so ([Job 36:16](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#016).md)
would he have done to thee if thou hadst submitted to his providence and
conducted thyself well; he would have delivered and comforted thee, and
we should have had none of these complaints. If thou hadst accommodated
thyself to the will of God, thy liberty and plenty would have been
restored to thee with advantage." 1. "Thou wouldst have been enlarged,
and not confined thus by thy sickness and disgrace: He would have
removed thee into a broad place where is no straitness, and thou wouldst
no longer have been cramped thus and have had all thy measures broken."
2. "Thou wouldst have been enriched, and wouldst not have been left in
this poor condition; thou wouldst have had thy table richly spread, not
only with food convenient, but with the finest of the wheat" (see [Deu
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#014).md) "and the fattest of the flesh."
Note, It ought to silence us under our afflictions to consider that, if
we were better, it would be every way better with us: if we had answered
the ends of an affliction, the affliction would be removed; and
deliverance would come if we were ready for it. God would have done well
for us if we had conducted ourselves well; [Psa
81:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#013.md), [Psa
81:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#014.md); [Isa
48:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#018.md).

II\. He charges him with standing in his own light, and makes him the
cause of the continuance of his own trouble ([Job
36:17](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#017).md): "But thou hast fulfilled the
judgment of the wicked," that is, "Whatever thou art really, in this
thing thou hast conducted thyself like a wicked man, hast spoken and
done like the wicked, hast gratified them and served their cause; and
therefore judgment and justice take hold on thee as a wicked man,
because thou goest in company with them, actest as if thou wert in their
interest, aiding and abetting. Thou hast maintained the cause of the
wicked; and such as a man's cause is such will the judgment of God be
upon him;" so bishop Patrick. It is dangerous being on the wrong side:
accessaries to treason will be dealt with as principals.

III\. He cautions him not to persist in his frowardness. Several good
cautions he gives him to this purport.

1\. Let him not make light of divine vengeance, nor be secure, as if he
were in no danger of it ([Job 36:18](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#018).md):
"Because there is wrath" (that is, "because God is a righteous governor,
who resents all the affronts given to his government, because he has
revealed his wrath from heaven against all ungodliness and
unrighteousness of men, and because thou hast reason to fear that thou
art under God's displeasure) therefore beware lest he take thee away
suddenly with his stroke, and be so wise as to make thy peace with him
quickly and get his anger turned away from thee." A warning to this
purport Job had given his friends ([Job
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#029).md): Be you afraid of the sword,
for wrath brings the punishment of the sword. Thus contenders are apt,
with too much boldness, to bind one another over to the judgment of God
and threaten one another with his wrath; but he that keeps a good
conscience needs not fear the impotent menaces of proud men. But his was
a friendly caution to Job, and necessary. Even good men have need to be
kept to their duty by the fear of God's wrath. "Thou art a wise and good
man, but beware lest he take thee away, for the wisest and best have
enough in them to deserve his stroke."

2\. Let him not promise himself that, if God's wrath should kindle
against him, he could find out ways to escape the strokes of it. (1.)
There is no escaping by money, no purchasing a pardon with silver, or
gold, and such corruptible things: "Even a great ransom cannot deliver
thee when God enters into judgment with thee. His justice cannot be
bribed, nor any of the ministers of his justice. Will he esteem thy
riches, and take from them a commutation of the punishment? No, not
gold, [Job 36:19](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#019.md). If thou hadst as
much wealth as ever thou hadst, that would not ease thee, would not
secure thee from the strokes of God's wrath, in the day of the
revelation of which riches profit not," [Pro
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#004.md). See [Psa
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#007.md), [Psa
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#008). (2..md) There is no escaping by
rescue: "If all the forces of strength were at thy command, if thou
couldst muster ever so many servants and vassals to appear for thee to
force thee out of the hands of divine vengeance, it were all in vain;
God would not regard it. There is none that can deliver out of his
hand." (3.) There is no escaping by absconding ([Job
36:20](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#020).md): "Desire not the night, which
often favours the retreat of a conquered army and covers it; think not
that thou canst so escape the righteous judgment of God, for the
darkness hideth not from him," [Psa
139:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#011.md), [Psa
139:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#012.md). See [Job
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#022.md). "Think not, because in the
night people retire to their place, go up to their beds, and it is then
easy to escape being discovered by them, that God also ascends to his
place, and cannot see thee. No; he neither slumbers nor sleeps. His eyes
are open upon the children of men, not only in all places, but at all
times. No rocks nor mountains can shelter us from his eye." Some
understand it of the night of death; that is the night by which men are
cut off from their place, and Job had earnestly breathed for that night,
as the hireling desires the evening, [Job
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#002.md). "But do not do so," says Elihu;
"for thou knowest not what the night of death is." Those that
passionately wish for death, in hopes to make that their shelter from
God's wrath, may perhaps be mistaken. There are those whom wrath pursues
into that night.

3\. Let him not continue his unjust quarrel with God and his providence,
which hitherto he had persisted in when he should have submitted to the
affliction ([Job 36:21](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#021).md): "Take heed,
look well to thy own spirit, and regard not iniquity, return not to it
(so some), for it is at thy peril if thou do." Let us never dare to
think a favourable thought of sin, never indulge it, nor allow ourselves
in it. Elihu thinks Job had need of this caution, he having chosen
iniquity rather than affliction, that is, having chosen rather to
gratify his own pride and humour in contending with God than to mortify
it by a submission to him and accepting the punishment. We may take it
more generally, and observe that those who choose iniquity rather than
affliction make a very foolish choice. Those that ease their cares by
sinful pleasures, increase their wealth by sinful pursuits, escape their
troubles by sinful projects, and evade sufferings for righteousness'
sake by sinful compliances against their consciences, make a choice they
will repent of; for there is more evil in the least sin than in the
greatest affliction. It is an evil, and only evil.

4\. Let him not dare to prescribe to God, nor give him his measures
([Job 36:22](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#022.md), [Job
36:23](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#023).md): "Behold, God exalteth by his
power," that is, "He does, may, and can set up and pull down whom he
pleases, and therefore it is not for thee nor me to contend with him."
The more we magnify God the more do we humble and abase ourselves. Now
consider, (1.) That God is an absolute sovereign: He exalts by his own
power, and not by strength derived from any other. He exalts whom he
pleases, exalts those that were afflicted and cast down, by the strength
and power which he gives his people; and therefore who has enjoined him
his way? Who presides above him in his way? Is there any superior from
whom he has his commission and to whom he is accountable? No; he himself
is supreme and independent. Who puts him in mind of his way? so some.
Does the eternal Mind need a remembrancer? No; his own way, as well as
ours, is ever before him. He has not received orders or instructions
from any ([Isa 60:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#013.md), [Isa
60:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#014).md), nor is he accountable to any.
He enjoins to all the creatures their way; let not us then enjoin him
his, but leave it to him to govern the world, who is fit to do it. (2.)
That he is an incomparable teacher: Who teaches like him? It is absurd
for us to teach him who is himself the fountain of light, truth,
knowledge, and instruction. He that teaches man knowledge, and so as
none else can, shall not he know? [Psa
94:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#009.md), [Psa
94:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#010.md). Shall we light a candle to the
sun? Observe, When Elihu would give glory to God as a ruler he praises
him as a teacher, for rulers must teach. God does so. He binds with the
cords of a man. In this, as in other things, he is unequalled. None so
fit to direct his own actions as he himself is. He knows what he has to
do, and how to do it for the best, and needs no information nor advice.
Solomon himself had a privy-council to advise him, but the King of kings
has none. Nor is any so fit to direct our actions as he is. None teaches
with such authority and convincing evidence, with such condescension and
compassion, nor with such power and efficacy, as God does. He teaches by
the Bible, and that is the best book, teaches by his Son, and he is the
best Master. (3.) That he is unexceptionably just in all his
proceedings: Who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity? Not, Who dares say
it? (many do iniquity, and those who tell them of it do so at their
peril), but Who can say it? Who has any cause to say it? Who can say it
and prove it? It is a maxim undoubtedly true, without limitation, that
the King of kings can do no wrong.

[Job 36:24](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 36:24</span></span>

Elihu is here endeavouring to possess Job with great and high thoughts
of God, and so to persuade him into a cheerful submission to his
providence.

I. He represents the work of God, in general, as illustrious and
conspicuous, [Job 36:24](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#024.md). His whole
work is so. God does nothing mean. This is a good reason why we should
acquiesce in all the operations of his providence concerning us in
particular. His visible works, those of nature, and which concern the
world in general, are such as we admire and commend, and in which we
observe the Creator's wisdom, power, and goodness; shall we then find
fault with his dispensations concerning us, and the counsels of his will
concerning our affairs? We are here called to consider the work of God,
[Ecc 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#013.md). 1. It is plain before our
eyes, nothing more obvious: it is what men behold. Every man that has
but half an eye may see it, may behold it afar off. Look which way we
will, we see the productions of God's wisdom and power; we see that
done, and that doing, concerning which we cannot but say, This is the
work of God, the finger of God; it is the Lord's doing. Every man may
see, afar off, the heaven and all its lights, the earth and all its
fruits, to be the work of Omnipotence; much more when we behold them
nigh at hand. Look at the minutest works of nature through a microscope;
do they not appear curious? The eternal power and godhead of the Creator
are clearly seen and understood by the things that are made, [Rom
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020.md). Every man, even those that have
not the benefit of divine revelation, may see this; for there is no
speech or language where the voice of these natural constant preachers
is not heard, [Psa 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#003.md). 2. It ought
to be marvellous in our eyes. The beauty and excellency of the work of
God, and the agreement of all the parts of it, are what we must remember
to magnify and highly to extol, not only justify it as right and good,
and what cannot be blamed, but magnify it as wise and glorious, and such
as no creature could contrive or produce. Man may see his works, and is
capable of discerning his hand in them (which the beasts are not), and
therefore ought to praise them and give him the glory of them.

II\. He represents God, the author of them, as infinite and
unsearchable, [Job 36:26](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#026.md). The streams
of being, power, and perfection should lead us to the fountain. God is
great, infinitely so, - great in power, for he is omnipotent and
independent, - great in wealth, for he is self-sufficient and
all-sufficient, - great in himself, - great in all his works, - great,
and therefore greatly to be praised, - great, and therefore we know him
not. We know that he is, but not what he is. We know what he is not, but
not what he is. We know in part, but not in perfection. This comes in
here as a reason why we must not arraign his proceedings, nor find fault
with what he does, because it is speaking evil of the things that we
understand not and answering a matter before we hear if. We know not the
duration of his existence, for it is infinite. The number of his years
cannot possibly be searched out, for he is eternal; there is no number
of them. He is a Being without beginning, succession, or period, who
ever was, and ever will be, and ever the same, the great I AM. This is a
good reason why we should not prescribe to him, nor quarrel with him,
because, as he is, such are his operations, quite out of our reach.

III\. He gives some instances of God's wisdom, power, and sovereign
dominion, in the works of nature and the dispensations of common
providence, beginning in this chapter with the clouds and the rain that
descends from them. We need not be critical in examining either the
phrase or the philosophy of this noble discourse. The general scope of
it is to show that God is infinitely great, and the Lord of all, the
first cause and supreme director of all the creatures, and has all power
in heaven and earth (whom therefore we ought, with all humility and
reverence, to adore, to speak well of, and to give honour to), and that
it is presumption for us to prescribe to him the rules and methods of
his special providence towards the children of men, or to expect from
him an account of them, when the operations even of common providences
about the meteors are so various and so mysterious and unaccountable.
Elihu, to affect Job with God's sublimity and sovereignty, had directed
him ([Job 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#005).md) to look unto the
clouds. In these verses he shows us what we may observe in the clouds we
see which will lead us to consider the glorious perfections of their
Creator. Consider the clouds,

1\. As springs to this lower world, the source and treasure of its
moisture, and the great bank through which it circulates - a very
necessary provision, for its stagnation would be as hurtful to this
lower world as that of the blood to the body of man. It is worth while
to observe in this common occurrence, (1.) That the clouds above distil
upon the earth below. If the heavens become brass, the earth becomes
iron; therefore thus the promise of plenty runs, I will hear the heavens
and they shall hear the earth. This intimates to us that every good gift
is from above, from him who is both Father of lights and Father of the
rain, and it instructs us to direct our prayers to him and to look up.
(2.) That they are here said to distil upon man (v. 28); for, though
indeed God causes it to rain in the wilderness where no man is ([Job
38:26](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#026.md), [Psa
104:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#011).md), yet special respect is had to
man herein, to whom the inferior creatures are all made serviceable and
from whom the actual return of the tribute of praise is required. Among
men, he causes his rain to fall upon the just and upon the unjust, [Mat
5:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045). (3..md) They are said to distil the
water in small drops, not in spouts, as when the windows of heaven were
opened, [Gen 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011.md). God waters the
earth with that with which he once drowned it, only dispensing it in
another manner, to let us know how much we lie at his mercy, and how
kind he is, in giving rain by drops, that the benefit of it may be the
further and the more equally diffused, as by an artificial water-pot.
(4.) Though sometimes the rain comes in very small drops, yet, at other
times, it pours down in great rain, and this difference between one
shower and another must be resolved into the divine Providence which
orders it so. (5.) Though it comes down in drops, yet it distils upon
man abundantly ([Job 36:28](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#028).md), and
therefore is called the river of God which is full of water, [Psa
65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009). (6..md) The clouds pour down
according to the vapour that they draw up, [Job
36:27](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#027.md). So just the heavens are to the
earth, but the earth is not so in the return it makes. (7.) The produce
of the clouds is sometimes a great terror, and at other times a great
favour, to the earth, [Job 36:31](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#031.md). When
he pleases by them he judges the people he is angry with. Storms, and
tempests, and excessive rains, destroying the fruits of the earth and
causing inundations, come from the clouds; but, on the other hand, from
them, usually, he gives meat in abundance; they drop fatness upon the
pastures that are clothed with flocks, and the valleys that are covered
with corn, [Psa 65:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#011). (8..md) Notice
is sometimes given of the approach of rain, [Job
36:33](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#033.md). The noise thereof, among other
things, shows concerning it. Hence we read ([Kg1
18:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#041).md) of the sound of abundance of
rain, or (as it is in the margin) a sound of a noise of rain, before it
came; and a welcome harbinger it was then. As the noise, so the face of
the sky, shows concerning it, [Luk
12:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#056.md). The cattle also, by a strange
instinct, are apprehensive of a change in the weather nigh at hand, and
seek for shelter, shaming man, who will not foresee the evil and hide
himself.

2\. As shadows to the upper world ([Job
36:29](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#029).md): Can any understand the
spreading of the clouds? They are spread over the earth as a curtain or
canopy; how they come to be so, how stretched out, and how poised, as
they are, we cannot understand, though we daily see they are so. Shall
we then pretend to understand the reasons and methods of God's judicial
proceedings with the children of men, whose characters and cases are so
various, when we cannot account for the spreadings of the clouds, which
cover the light? [Job 36:32](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#032.md). It is a
cloud coming betwixt, [Job 36:32](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#032.md); [Job
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#009.md). And this we are sensible of,
that, by the interposition of the clouds between us and the sun, we are,
(1.) Sometimes favoured; for they serve as an umbrella to shelter us
from the violent heat of the sun, which otherwise would beat upon us. A
cloud of dew in the heat of harvest is spoken of as a very great
refreshment. [Isa 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#004). (2..md) Sometimes
we are by them frowned upon; for they darken the earth at noon-day and
eclipse the light of the sun. Sin is compared to a cloud ([Isa
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#022).md), because it comes between us
and the light of God's countenance and obstructs the shining of it. But
though the clouds darken the sun for a time, and pour down rain, yet
(post nubila Phoebus - the sun shines forth after the rain), after he
has wearied the cloud, he spreads his light upon it, [Job
36:30](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#030.md). There is a clear shining after
rain, [Sa2 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#004.md). The sunbeams are
darted forth, and reach to cover even the bottom of the sea, thence to
exhale a fresh supply of vapours, and so raise recruits for the clouds,
[Job 36:30](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#030.md). In all this, we must
remember to magnify the work of God.
