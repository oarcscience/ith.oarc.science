### [2 Thessalonians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001.md)

[2 Thessalonians](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">th2 2:0</span></span>

The apostle is very careful to hinder the spreading of an error into
which some among them had fallen concerning the coming of Christ, as
being very near ([Th2 2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001).md). Then he
proceeds to confute the error he cautioned them against, by telling them
of two great events that were antecedent to the coming of Christ - a
general apostasy, and the revelation of antichrist, concerning whom the
apostle tells them many remarkable things, about his name, his
character, his rise, his fall, his reign, and the sin and ruin of his
subjects ([Th2 2:4-12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004).md). He then
comforts them against the terror of this apostasy, and exhorts them to
stedfastness ([Th2 2:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013).md). And
concludes with a prayer for them ([Th2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#016.md), [Th2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#017).md).

[2 Thessalonians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th2 2:1</span></span>

From these words it appears that some among the Thessalonians had
mistaken the apostle's meaning, in what he had written in his former
epistle about the coming of Christ, by thinking that it was near at
hand, - that Christ was just ready to appear and come to judgment. Or,
it may be, some among them pretended that they had the knowledge of this
by particular revelation from the Spirit, or from some words they had
heard from the apostle, when he was with them, or some letter he had
written or they pretended he had written to them or some other person:
and hereupon the apostle is careful to rectify this mistake, and to
prevent the spreading of this error. Observe, If errors and mistakes
arise among Christians, we should take the first opportunity to rectify
them, and hinder the spreading thereof; and good men will be especially
careful to suppress errors that may arise from a mistake of their words
and actions, though that which was spoken or done was ever so innocent
or well. We have a subtle adversary, who watches all opportunities to do
mischief, and will sometimes promote errors even by means of the words
of scripture. Observe,

I. How very earnest and solicitous this apostle was to prevent mistakes:
We beseech you, brethren, etc., [Th2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001.md). He entreats them as brethren who
might have charged them as a father charges his children: he shows great
kindness and condescension, and insinuates himself into their
affections. And this is the best way to deal with men when we would
preserve or recover them from errors, to deal gently and affectionately
with them: rough and rigorous treatment will but exasperate their
spirits, and prejudice them against the reasons we may offer. He obtests
and even conjures them in the most solemn manner: By the coming of
Christ, etc. The words are in the form of an oath; and his meaning is
that if they believed Christ would come, and if they desired he would
come, and rejoiced in the hope of his coming, they should be careful to
avoid the error, and the evil consequences of it, against which he was
now cautioning them. From this form of obtestation used by the apostle,
we may observe,

1\. It is most certain that the Lord Jesus Christ will come to judge the
world, that he will come in all the pomp and power of the upper world in
the last day, to execute judgment upon all. Whatever uncertainty we are
at, or whatever mistakes may arise about the time of his coming, his
coming itself is certain. This has been the faith and hope of all
Christians in all ages of the church; nay, it was the faith and hope of
the Old Testament saints, ever since Enoch the seventh from Adam, who
said, Behold, the Lord cometh, etc., [Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014.md).

2\. At the second coming of Christ all the saints will be gathered
together to him; and this mention of the gathering of the saints
together unto Christ at his coming shows that the apostle speaks of
Christ's coming to judgment day, and not of his coming to destroy
Jerusalem. He speaks of a proper, and not a metaphorical advent: and, as
it will be part of Christ's honour in that day, so it will be the
completing of the happiness of his saints. (1.) That they all shall be
gathered together. There will then be a general meeting of all the
saints, and none but saints; all the Old Testament saints, who got
acquaintance with Christ by the dark shadows of the law, and saw this
day at a distance; and all the New Testament saints, to whom life and
immortality were brought to light by the gospel; they will all be
gathered together. There will then come from the four winds of heaven
all that are, or ever were, or ever shall be, from the beginning to the
end of time. All shall be gathered together. (2.) That they shall be
gathered together to Christ. He will be the great centre of their unity.
They shall be gathered together to him, to be attendants on him, to be
assessors with him, to be presented by him to the Father, to be with him
for ever, and altogether happy in his presence to all eternity. (3.) The
doctrine of Christ's coming and our gathering together to him is of a
great moment and importance to Christians; otherwise it would not be the
proper matter of the apostle's obtestation. We ought therefore not only
to believe these things, but highly to account of them also, and look
upon them as things we are greatly concerned in and should be much
affected with.

II\. The thing itself against which the apostle cautions the
Thessalonians is that they should not be deceived about the time of
Christ's coming, and so be shaken in mind, or be troubled. Note, Errors
in the mind tend greatly to weaken our faith, and cause us trouble; and
such as are weak in faith and of troubled minds are oftentimes apt to be
deceived, and fall a prey to seducers. 1. The apostle would not have
them be deceived: Let no man deceive you by any means, [Th2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003.md). There are many who lie in wait to
deceive, and they have many ways of deceiving; we have reason therefore
to be cautious and stand upon our guard. Some deceivers will pretend new
revelations, others misinterpret scripture, and others will be guilty of
gross forgeries; divers means and artifices of deceit men will use; but
we must be careful that no man deceive us by any means. The particular
matter in which the apostle cautions them not to be deceived is about
the near approach of Christ's coming, as if it was to have been in the
apostle's days; and harmless as this error might seem to many, yet,
because it was indeed an error, it would have proved of bad consequences
to many persons. Therefore, 2. He gives them warning, and would not have
them be soon shaken in mind, nor be troubled. (1.) He would not have
their faith weakened. We should firmly believe the second coming of
Christ, and be settled and established in the faith of this; but there
was danger lest the Thessalonians, if they apprehended the coming of
Christ was just at hand, upon finding that they, or others whom they too
much regarded, were mistaken as to the time, should thereupon question
the truth or certainty of the thing itself; whereas they ought not to
waver in their minds as to this great thing, which is the faith and hope
of all the saints. False doctrines are like winds, that toss the water
to and fro, and they are apt to unsettle the minds of men, who are
sometimes as unstable as water. Then, (2.) He would not have their
comforts lessened, that they should not be troubled nor affrighted with
false alarms. It is probable that the coming of Christ was represented
in so much terror as to trouble many serious Christians among them,
though in itself it should be matter of the believer's hope and joy; or
else many might be troubled with the thought how surprising this day
would be, or with the fear of their unpreparedness, or upon the
reflection on their mistake about the time of Christ's coming: we should
always watch and pray, but must not be discouraged nor uncomfortable at
the thought of Christ's coming.

[2 Thessalonians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th2 2:3</span></span>

In these words the apostle confutes the error against which he had
cautioned them, and gives the reasons why they should not expect the
coming of Christ as just at hand. There were several events previous to
the second coming of Christ; in particular, he tells them there would
be,

I. A general apostasy, there would come a falling away first, [Th2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003.md). By this apostasy we are not to
understand a defection in the state, or from civil government, but in
spiritual or religious matters, from sound doctrine, instituted worship
and church government, and a holy life. The apostle speaks of some very
great apostasy, not only of some converted Jews or Gentiles, but such as
should be very general, though gradual, and should give occasion to the
revelation of rise of antichrist, that man of sin. This, he says ([Th2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#005).md), he had told them of when he was
with them, with design, no doubt, that they should not take offence nor
be stumbled at it. And let us observe that no sooner was Christianity
planted and rooted in the world than there began to be a defection in
the Christian church. It was so in the Old Testament church; presently
after any considerable advance made in religion there followed a
defection: soon after the promise there was revolting; for example, soon
after men began to call upon the name of the Lord all flesh corrupted
their way, - soon after the covenant with Noah the Babel-builders bade
defiance to heaven, - soon after the covenant with Abraham his seed
degenerated in Egypt, - soon after the Israelites were planted in
Canaan, when the first generation was worn off, they forsook God and
served Baal, - soon after God's covenant with David his seed revolted,
and served other gods, - soon after the return out of captivity there
was a general decay of piety, as appears by the story of Ezra and
Nehemiah; and therefore it was no strange thing that after the planting
of Christianity there should come a falling away.

II\. A revelation of that man of sin, that is ([Th2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003).md), antichrist would take his rise
from this general apostasy. The apostle afterwards speaks of the
revelation of that wicked one ([Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008).md), intimating the discovery which
should be made of his wickedness, in order to his ruin: here he seems to
speak of his rise, which should be occasioned by the general apostasy he
had mentioned, and to intimate that all sorts of false doctrines and
corruptions should centre in him. Great disputes have been as to who or
what is intended by this man of sin and son of perdition: and, if it be
not certain that the papal power and tyranny are principally or only
intended, yet this is plain, What is here said does very exactly agree
thereto. For observe,

1\. The names of this person, or rather the state and power here spoken
of. He is called the man of sin, to denote his egregious wickedness; not
only is he addicted to, and practises, wickedness himself, but he also
promotes, countenances, and commands sin and wickedness in others; and
he is the son of perdition, because he himself is devoted to certain
destruction, and is the instrument of destroying many others both in
soul and body. These names may properly be applied, for these reasons,
to the papal state; and thereto agree also,

2\. The characters here given, [Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004). (1..md) That he opposes and exalts
himself above all that is called God, or is worshipped; and thus have
the bishops of Rome not only opposed God's authority, and that of the
civil magistrates, who are called gods, but have exalted themselves
above God and earthly governors, in demanding greater regard to their
commands than to the commands of God or the magistrate. (2.) As God, he
sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God. As God was in
the temple of old, and worshipped there, and is in and with his church
now, so the antichrist here mentioned is some usurper of God's authority
in the Christian church, who claims divine honours; and to whom can this
better apply than to the bishops of Rome, to whom the most blasphemous
titles have been given, as Dominus Deus noster papa - Our Lord God the
pope; Deus alter in terr - Another God on earth; Idem est dominium Dei
et papae - The dominion of God and the pope is the same?

3\. His rise is mentioned, [Th2 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#006.md),
[Th2 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#007.md). Concerning this we are to
observe two things: - (1.) There was something that hindered or
withheld, or let, until it was taken away. This is supposed to be the
power of the Roman empire, which the apostle did not think fit to
mention more plainly at that time; and it is notorious that, while this
power continued, it prevented the advances of the bishops of Rome to
that height of tyranny to which soon afterwards they arrived. (2.) This
mystery of iniquity was gradually to arrive at its height; and so it was
in effect that the universal corruption of doctrine and worship in the
Romish church came in by degrees, and the usurpation of the bishops of
Rome was gradual, not all at once; and thus the mystery of iniquity did
the more easily, and almost insensibly, prevail. The apostle justly
calls it a mystery of iniquity, because wicked designs and actions were
concealed under false shows and pretences, at least they were concealed
from the common view and observation. By pretended devotion,
superstition and idolatry were advanced; and, by a pretended zeal for
God and his glory, bigotry and persecution were promoted. And he tells
us that this mystery of iniquity did even then begin, or did already
work. While the apostles were yet living, the enemy came, and sowed
tares; there were then the deeds of the Nicolaitans, persons who
pretended zeal for Christ, but really opposed him. Pride, ambition, and
worldly interest of church-pastors and church-rulers, as in Diotrephes
and others, were the early working of the mystery of iniquity, which, by
degrees, came to that prodigious height which has been visible in the
church of Rome.

4\. The fall or ruin of the antichristian state is declared, [Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008.md). The head of this antichristian
kingdom is called that wicked one, or that lawless person who sets up a
human power in competition with, and contradiction to, the divine
dominion and power of the Lord Jesus Christ; but, as he would thus
manifest himself to be the man of sin, so the revelation or discovery of
this to the world would be the sure presage and the means of his ruin.
The apostle assures the Thessalonians that the Lord would consume and
destroy him; the consuming of him precedes his final destruction, and
that is by the Spirit of his mouth, by his word of command; the pure
word of God, accompanied with the Spirit of God, will discover this
mystery of iniquity, and make the power of antichrist to consume and
waste away; and in due time it will be totally and finally destroyed,
and this will be by the brightness of Christ's coming. Note, The coming
of Christ to destroy the wicked will be with peculiar glory and eminent
lustre and brightness.

5\. The apostle further describes the reign and rule of this man of sin.
Here we are to observe, (1.) The manner of his coming, or ruling, and
working: in general, that it is after the example of Satan, the grand
enemy of souls, the great adversary of God and man. He is the great
patron of error and lies, the sworn enemy of the truth as it is in Jesus
and all the faithful followers of Jesus. More particularly, it is with
Satanical power and deceit. A divine power is pretended for the support
of this kingdom, but it is only after the working of Satan. Signs and
wonders, visions and miracles, are pretended; by these the papal kingdom
was first set up, and has all along been kept up, but they have false
signs to support false doctrines; and lying wonders, or only pretended
miracles that have served their cause, things false in fact, or
fraudulently managed, to impose upon the people: and the diabolical
deceits with which the antichristian state has been supported are
notorious. The apostle calls it all deceivableness of unrighteousness,
[Th2 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#010.md). Others may call them pious
frauds, but the apostle called them unrighteous and wicked frauds; and,
indeed, all fraud (which is contrary to truth) is an impious thing. Many
are the subtle artifices the man of sin has used, and various are the
plausible pretences by which he had beguiled unwary and unstable souls
to embrace false doctrines, and submit to his usurped dominion. (2.) The
persons are described who are his willing subjects, or most likely to
become such, [Th2 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#010.md). They are such
as love not the truth that they may be saved. They heard the truth (it
may be), but they did not love it; they could not bear sound doctrine,
and therefore easily imbibed false doctrines; they had some notional
knowledge of what was true, but they indulged some powerful prejudices,
and so became a prey to seducers. Had they loved the truth, they would
have persevered in it, and been preserved by it; but no wonder if they
easily parted with what they never had any love to. And of these persons
it is said that they perish or are lost; they are in a lost condition,
and in danger to be lost for ever. For,

6\. We have the sin and ruin of the subjects of antichrist's kingdom
declared, [Th2 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011.md), [Th2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#012). (1..md) Their sin is this: They
believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness: they did
not love the truth, and therefore they did not believe it; and, because
they did not believe the truth, therefore they had pleasure in
unrighteousness, or in wicked actions, and were pleased with false
notions. Note, An erroneous mind and vicious life often go together and
help forward one another. (2.) Their ruin is thus expressed: God shall
send them strong delusions, to believe a lie. Thus he will punish men
for their unbelief, and for their dislike of the truth and love to sin
and wickedness; not that God is the author of sin, but in righteousness
he sometimes withdraws his grace from such sinners as are here
mentioned; he gives them over to Satan, or leaves them to be deluded by
his instruments; he gives them up to their own hearts' lusts, and leaves
them to themselves, and then sin will follow of course, yea, the worst
of wickedness, that shall end at last in eternal damnation. God is just
when he inflicts spiritual judgments here, and eternal punishments
hereafter, upon those who have no love to the truths of the gospel, who
will not believe them, nor live suitably to them, but indulge false
doctrines in their minds, and wicked practices in their lives and
conversations.

[2 Thessalonians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">th2 2:13</span></span>

Here observe, I. The consolation the Thessalonians might take against
the terrors of this apostasy, [Th2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013.md), [Th2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#014.md). For they were chosen to
salvation, and called to the obtaining of glory. Note, When we hear of
the apostasy of many, it is matter of great comfort and joy that there
is a remnant according to the election of grace which does and shall
persevere; and especially we should rejoice if we have reason to hope
that we are of that number. The apostle reckoned himself bound in duty
to be thankful to God on this account: We are bound to give thanks to
God always for you. He had often given thanks on their behalf, and he is
still abounding in thanksgiving for them; and there was good reason,
because they were beloved by the Lord, as appeared in this matter -
their security from apostatizing. This preservation of the saints is
owing,

1\. To the stability of the election of grace, [Th2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013.md). Therefore were they beloved of
the Lord, because God had chosen them from the beginning. He had loved
them with an everlasting love. Concerning this election of God we may
observe, (1.) The eternal date of it - it is from the beginning; not the
beginning of the gospel, but the beginning of the world, before the
foundation of the world, [Eph 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004.md).
Then, (2.) The end to which they were chosen - salvation, complete and
eternal salvation from sin and misery, and the full fruition of all
good. (3.) The means in order to obtaining this end - sanctification of
the spirit and belief of the truth. The decree of election therefore
connects the end and the means, and these must not be separated. We are
not the elected of God because we were holy, but that we might be holy.
Being chosen of God, we must not live as we list; but, if we are chosen
to salvation as the end, we must be prepared for it by sanctification as
the necessary means to obtain that end, which sanctification is by the
operation of the Holy Spirit as the author and by faith on our part.
There must be the belief of the truth, without which there can be by
true sanctification, nor perseverance in grace, nor obtaining of
salvation. Faith and holiness must be joined together, as well as
holiness and happiness; therefore our Saviour prayed for Peter that his
faith might not fail ([Luk 22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032).md), and
for his disciples ([Joh 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017).md),
Sanctify them by thy truth; thy word is truth.

2\. To the efficacy of the gospel call, [Th2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#014.md). As they were chosen to
salvation, so they were called thereunto by the gospel. Whom he did
predestinate those he also called, [Rom
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030.md). The outward call of God is by
the gospel; and this is rendered effectual by the inward operation of
the Spirit. Note, Wherever the gospel comes it calls and invites men to
the obtaining of glory; it is a call to honour and happiness, even the
glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glory he has purchased, and the
glory he is possessed of, to be communicated unto those who believe in
him and obey his gospel; such shall be with Christ, to behold his glory,
and they shall be glorified with Christ and partake of his glory.
Hereupon there follows,

II\. An exhortation to stedfastness and perseverance: Therefore,
brethren, stand fast, [Th2 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#015.md).
Observe, He does not say, "You are chosen to salvation, and therefore
you may be careless and secure;" but therefore stand fast. God's grace
in our election and vocation is so far from superseding our diligent
care and endeavour that it should quicken and engage us to the greatest
resolution and diligence. So the apostle John having told those to whom
he wrote that they had received the anointing which should abide in
them, and that they should abide in him (in Christ), subjoins this
exhortation, Now abide in him, [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027.md), [Jo1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#028.md). The Thessalonians are exhorted
to stedfastness in their Christian profession, to hold fast the
traditions which they had been taught, or the doctrine of the gospel,
which had been delivered by the apostle, by word or epistle. As yet the
canon of scripture was not complete, and therefore some things were
delivered by the apostles in their preaching, under the guidance of the
infallible Spirit, which Christians were bound to observe as coming from
God; other things were afterwards by them committed to writing, as the
apostle had written a former epistle to these Thessalonians; and these
epistles were written as the writers were moved by the Holy Ghost. Note,
There is no argument hence for regarding oral traditions in our days,
now that the canon of scripture is complete, as of equal authority with
the sacred writings. Such doctrines and duties as were taught by the
inspired apostles we must stedfastly adhere to; but we have no certain
evidence of any thing delivered by them more than what we find contained
in the holy scriptures.

[2 Thessalonians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">th2 2:16</span></span>

In these words we have the apostle's earnest prayer for them, in which
observe,

I. To whom he prays: Our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our
Father. We may and should direct our prayers, not only to God the
Father, through the mediation of our Lord Jesus Christ, but also to our
Lord Jesus Christ himself; and should pray in his name unto God, not
only as his Father but as our Father in and through him.

II\. From what he takes encouragement in his prayer - from the
consideration of what God had already done for him and them: Who hath
loved us, and given us everlasting consolation and good hope through
grace, [Th2 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#016.md). Here observe, 1. The
love of God is the spring and fountain of all the good we have or hope
for; our election, vocation, justification, and salvation, are all owing
to the love of God in Christ Jesus. 2. From this fountain in particular
all our consolation flows. And the consolation of the saints is an
everlasting consolation. The comforts of the saints are not dying
things; they shall not die with them. The spiritual consolations God
gives none shall deprive them of; and God will not take them away:
because he love them with an everlasting love, therefore they shall have
everlasting consolation. 3. Their consolation is founded on the hope of
eternal life. They rejoice in hope of the glory of God, and are not only
patient, but joyful, in tribulations; and there is good reason for these
strong consolations, because the saints have good hope: their hope is
grounded on the love of God, the promise of God, and the experience they
have had of the power, the goodness, and the faithfulness of God, and it
is good hope through grace; the free grace and mercy of God are what
they hope for, and what their hopes are founded on, and not on any worth
or merit of their own.

III\. What it is that he asks of God for them - that he would comfort
their hearts, and establish them in every good word and work, [Th2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#017.md). God had given them consolations,
and he prayed that they might have more abundant consolation. There was
good hope, through grace, that they would be preserved, and he prayed
that they might be established: it is observable how comfort and
establishment are here joined together. Note therefore, 1. Comfort is a
means of establishment; for the more pleasure we take in the word, and
work, and ways of God, the more likely we shall be to persevere therein.
And, 2. Our establishment in the ways of God is a likely means in order
to comfort; whereas, if we are wavering in faith, and of a doubtful
mind, or if we are halting and faltering in our duty, no wonder if we
are strangers to the pleasures and joys of religion. What is it that
lies at the bottom of all our uneasiness, but our unsteadiness in
religion? We must be established in every good word and work, in the
word of truth and the work of righteousness: Christ must be honoured by
our good works and good words; and those who are sincere will endeavour
to do both, and in so doing they may hope for comfort and establishment,
till at length their holiness and happiness be completed.
