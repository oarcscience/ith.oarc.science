### [Psalms Chapter 70](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 70:0</span></span>

This psalm is adapted to a state of affliction; it is copied almost word
for word from the fortieth, and, some think for that reason, is
entitled, "a psalm to bring to remembrance;" for it may be of use
sometimes to pray over the prayers we have formerly made to God upon
similar occasions, which may be done with new affections. David here
prays that God would send, I. Help to himself ([Psa
70:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001.md), [Psa
70:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#005).md). II. Shame to his enemies ([Psa
70:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#002.md), [Psa
70:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#003).md). III. Joy to his friends ([Psa
70:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#004).md). These five verses were the last
five verses of Ps. 40. He seems to have intended this short prayer to be
both for himself and us a salve for every sore, and therefore to be
always in mind; and in singing we may apply it to our particular
troubles, whatever they are.

To the chief musician. A psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.

[Psalms 70:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 70:1</span></span>

The title tells us that this psalm was designed to bring to remembrance;
that is, to put God in remembrance of his mercy and promises (for so we
are said to do when we pray to him and plead with him. [Isa
43:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#026), Put me in remembrance.md) - not
that the Eternal Mind needs a remembrancer, but this honour he is
pleased to put upon the prayer of faith. Or, rather, to put himself and
others in remembrance of former afflictions, that we may never be
secure, but always in expectation of troubles, and of former devotions,
that when the clouds return after the rain we may have recourse to the
same means which we have formerly found effectual for fetching in
comfort and relief. We may in prayer use the words we have often used
before: our Saviour in his agony prayed thrice, saying the same words;
so David here uses the words he had used before, yet not without some
alterations, to show that he did not design to tie himself or others to
them as a form. God looks at the heart, not at the words.

I. David here prays that God would make haste to relieve and succour him
([Psa 70:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001.md), [Psa
70:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#005).md): I am poor and needy, in want
and distress, and much at a loss within myself. Poverty and necessity
are very good pleas in prayer to a God of infinite mercy, who despises
not the sighing of a contrite heart, who has pronounced a blessing upon
the poor in spirit, and who fills the hungry with good things. He prays,
1. That God would appear for him to deliver him from his troubles in due
time. 2. That in the mean time he would come in to his aid, to help him
under his troubles, that he might not sink and faint. 3. That he would
do this quickly: Make haste ([Psa
70:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001).md), and again ([Psa
70:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#005).md), Make haste, make no tarrying.
Sometimes God seems to delay helping his own people, that he may excite
such earnest desires as these. He that believes does not make haste, so
as to anticipate or outrun the divine counsels, so as to force a way of
escape or to take any unlawful methods of relief; but he may make haste
by going forth to meet God in humble prayer that he would hasten the
desired succour. "Make haste unto me, for the longing desire of my soul
is towards thee; I shall perish if I be not speedily helped. I have no
other to expect relief from: Thou art my help and my delivered. Thou
hast engaged to be so to all that seek thee; I depend upon thee to be so
to me; I have often found thee so; and thou art sufficient,
all-sufficient, to be so; therefore make haste to me."

II\. He prays that God would fill the faces of his enemies with shame,
[Psa 70:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#002.md), [Psa
70:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#003.md). Observe, 1. How he describes
them; they sought after his soul - his life, to destroy that - his mind,
to disturb that, to draw him from God to sin and to despair. They
desired his hurt, his ruin; when any calamity befel him or threatened
him they said, "Aha, aha! so would we have it; we shall gain our point
now, and see him ruined." Thus spiteful, thus insolent, were they. 2.
What his prayer is against them: "Let them be ashamed; let them be
brought to repentance, so filled with shame as that they may seek thy
name ([Psa 83:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#016).md); let them see their
fault and folly in fighting against those whom thou dost protect, and be
ashamed of their envy, [Isa 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#011.md).
However, let their designs against me be frustrated and their measures
broken; let them be turned back from their malicious pursuits, and then
they will be ashamed and confounded, and, like the enemies of the Jews,
much cast down in their own eyes," [Gen
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#016.md).

III\. He prays that God would fill the hearts of his friends with joy
([Psa 70:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#004).md), that all those who seek
God and love his salvation, who desire it, delight in it, and depend
upon it, may have continual matter for joy and praise and hearts for
both; and then he doubts not but that he should put in for a share of
the blessing he prays for; and so may we if we answer the character. 1.
Let us make the service of God our great business and the favour of God
our great delight and pleasure, for that is seeking him and loving his
salvation. Let the pursuit of a happiness in God be our great care and
the enjoyment of it our great satisfaction. A heart to love the
salvation of the Lord, and to prefer it before any secular advantages
whatsoever, so as cheerfully to quit all rather than hazard our
salvation, is a good evidence of our interest in it and title to it. 2.
Let us then be assured that, if it be not our own fault, the joy of the
Lord shall fill our minds and the high praises of the Lord shall fill
our mouths. Those that seek God, if they seek him early and seek him
diligently, shall rejoice and be glad in him, for their seeking him is
an evidence of his good-will to them and an earnest of their finding
him, [Psa 105:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#003.md). There is pleasure and
joy even in seeking God, for it is one of the fundamental principles of
religion that God is the rewarder of all those that diligently seek him.
Those that love God's salvation shall say with pleasure, with constant
pleasure (for praising God, if we make it our continual work, will be
our continual feast), Let God be magnified, as he will be, to eternity,
in the salvation of his people. All who wish well to the comfort of the
saints, and to the glory of God, cannot but say a hearty amen to this
prayer, that those who love God's salvation may say continually, Let God
be magnified.
