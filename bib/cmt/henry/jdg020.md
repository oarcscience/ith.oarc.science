### [Judges Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#001.md)

[Judges](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jdg 20:0</span></span>

Into the book of the wars of the Lord the story of this chapter must be
brought, but it looks as sad and uncomfortable as any article in all
that history; for there is nothing in it that looks in the least bright
or pleasant but the pious zeal of Israel against the wickedness of the
men of Gibeah, which made it on their side a just and holy war; but
otherwise the obstinacy of the Benjamites in protecting their criminals,
which was the foundation of the war, the vast loss which the Israelites
sustained in carrying on the war, and (though the righteous cause was
victorious at last) the issuing of the war in the almost utter
extirpation of the tribe of Benjamin, make it, from first to last,
melancholy. And yet this happened soon after the glorious settlement of
Israel in the land of promise, upon which one would have expected every
thing to be prosperous and serene. In this chapter we have, I. The
Levite's cause heard in a general convention of the tribes ([Jdg
20:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#001).md). II. A unanimous resolve to
avenge his quarrel upon the men of Gibeah ([Jdg
20:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#008).md). III. The Benjamites
appearing in defence of the criminals ([Jdg
20:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#012).md). IV. The defeat of Israel in
the first and second day's battle ([Jdg
20:18-25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#018).md). V. Their humbling
themselves before God upon that occasion ([Jdg
20:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#026).md). VI. The total rout they
gave the Benjamites in the third engagement, by a stratagem, by which
they were all cut off, except 600 men (v. 29-48). And all this the
effect of the indignities done to one poor Levite and his wife; so
little do those that do iniquity consider what will be the end thereof.

[Judges 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 20:1</span></span>

Here is, I. A general meeting of all the congregation of Israel to
examine the matter concerning the Levite's concubine, and to consider
what was to be done upon it, [Jdg
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#001.md), [Jdg
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#002.md). It does not appear that they
were summoned by the authority of any one common head, but they came
together by the consent and agreement, as it were, of one common heart,
fired with a holy zeal for the honour of God and Israel. 1. The place of
their meeting was Mizpeh; they gathered together unto the Lord there,
for Mizpeh was so very near to Shiloh that their encampment might very
well be supposed to reach from Mizpeh to Shiloh. Shiloh was a small
town, and therefore, when there was a general meeting of the people to
represent themselves before God, they chose Mizpeh for their
head-quarters, which was the next adjoining city of note, perhaps
because they were not willing to give that trouble to Shiloh which so
great an assembly would occasion, it being the resident of the priests
that attended the tabernacle. 2. The persons that met were all Israel,
from Dan (the city very lately so called, [Jdg
18:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#029).md) in the north to Beersheba in
the south, with the land of Gilead (that is, the tribes on the other
side Jordan), all as one man, so unanimous were they in their concern
for the public good. Here was an assembly of the people of God, not a
convocation of the Levites and priests, though a Levite was the person
principally concerned in the cause, but an assembly of the people, to
whom the Levite referred himself with an Appello populum - I appeal to
the people. The people of God were 400,000 footmen that drew the sword,
that is, were armed and disciplined, and fit for service, and some of
them perhaps such as had known the wars of Canaan, [Jdg
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#001.md). In this assembly of all Israel,
the chief (or corners) of the people (for rulers are the corner-stones
of the people, that keep all together) presented themselves as the
representatives of the rest. They rendered themselves at their
respective posts, at the head of the thousands and hundreds, the fifties
and tens, over which they presided; for so much order and government, we
may suppose, at least, they had among them, though they had no general
or commander-in-chief. So that here was, (1.) A general congress of the
states for counsel. The chief of the people presented themselves, to
lead and direct in this affair. (2.) A general rendezvous of the militia
for action, all that drew sword and were men of war ([Jdg
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#017).md), not hirelings nor pressed men,
but the best freeholders, that went at their own charge. Israel were
above 600,000 when they came into Canaan, and we have reason to think
they were at this time much increased, rather than diminished; but then
all between twenty and sixty were military men, now we may suppose more
than the one half exempted from bearing arms to cultivate the land; so
that these were as the trained bands. The militia of the two tribes and
a half were 40,000 ([Jos 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#013).md), but
the tribes were many more.

II\. Notice given to the tribe of Benjamin of this meeting ([Jdg
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#003).md): They heard that the children of
Israel had gone up to Mizpeh. Probably they had a legal summons sent
them to appear with their brethren, that the cause might be fairly
debated, before any resolutions were taken up upon it, and so the
mischiefs that followed would have been happily prevented; but the
notice they had of this meeting rather hardened and exasperated them
than awakened them to think of the things that belonged to their peace
and honour.

III\. A solemn examination of the crime charged upon the men of Gibeah.
A very horrid representation of it had been made by the report of the
messengers that were sent to call them together, but it was fit it
should be more closely enquired into, because such things are often made
worse than really they were; a committee therefore was appointed to
examine the witnesses (upon oath, no doubt) and to report the matter. It
is only the testimony of the Levite himself that is here recorded, but
it is probable his servant, and the old man, were examined, and gave in
their testimony, for that more than one were examined appears by the
original ([Jdg 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#003).md), which is, Tell
you us; and the law was that none should be put to death, much less so
many, upon the testimony of one witness only. The Levite gives a
particular account of the matter: that he came into Gibeah only as a
traveller to lodge there, not giving the least shadow of suspicion that
he designed them any ill turn ([Jdg
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#004).md), and that the men of Gibeah,
even those that were of substance among them, that should have been a
protection to the stranger within their gates, riotously set upon the
house where he lodged, and thought to slay him; he could not, for shame
relate the demand which they, without shame, made, [Jdg
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#022.md). They declared their sin as
Sodom, even the sin of Sodom, but his modesty would not suffer him to
repeat it; it was sufficient to say they would have slain him, for he
would rather have been slain than have submitted to their villany; and,
if they had got him into their hands, they would have abused him to
death, witness what they had done to his concubine: They have forced her
that she is dead, [Jdg 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#005.md). And, to
excite in his countrymen an indignation at this wickedness, he had sent
pieces of the mangled body to all the tribes, which had fetched them
together to bear their testimony against the lewdness and folly
committed in Israel, [Jdg 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#006.md). All
lewdness is folly, but especially lewdness in Israel. For those to
defile their own bodies who have the honourable seal of the covenant in
their flesh, for those to defy the divine vengeance to whom it is so
clearly revealed from heaven - Nabal is their name, and folly is with
them. He concludes his declaration with an appeal to the judgment of the
court ([Jdg 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#007).md): You are all
children of Israel, and therefore you know law and judgment, [Est
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#013.md). "You are a holy people to God,
and have a dread of every thing which will dishonour God and defile the
land; you are of the same community, members of the same body, and
therefore likely to feel from the distempers of it; you are children of
Israel, that ought to take particular care of the Levites, God's tribe,
among you, and therefore give your advice and counsel what is to be
done."

IV\. The resolution they came to hereupon, which was that, being now
together, they would not disperse till they had seen vengeance taken
upon this wicked city, which was the reproach and scandal of their
nation. Observe, 1. Their zeal against the lewdness that was committed.
They would not return to their houses, how much soever their families
and their affairs at home wanted them, till they had vindicated the
honour of God and Israel, and recovered with their swords, if it could
not be had otherwise, that satisfaction for the crime which the justice
of the nation called for, [Jdg 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#008.md).
By this they showed themselves children of Israel indeed, that they
preferred the public interest before their private concerns. 2. Their
prudence in sending out a considerable body of their forces to fetch
provisions for the rest, [Jdg 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#009.md),
[Jdg 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#010.md). One of ten, and he chosen
by lot, 40,000 in all, must go to their respective countries, whence
they came, to fetch bread and other necessaries for the subsistence of
this great army; for when they came from home they took with them
provisions only for a journey to Mizpeh, not for an encampment (which
might prove long) before Gibeah. This was to prevent their scattering to
forage for themselves, for, if they had done this, it would have been
hard to get them all together again, especially all in so good a mind.
Note, When there appears in people a pious zeal for any good work it is
best to strike while the iron is hot, for such zeal is apt to cool
quickly if the prosecution of the work be delayed. Let it never be said
that we left that good work to be done tomorrow which we could as well
have done today. 3. Their unanimity in these counsels, and the execution
of them. The resolution was voted, Nemine contradicente - Without a
dissenting voice ([Jdg 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#008).md); it was
one and all; and, when it was put in execution, they were knit together
as one man, [Jdg 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#011.md). This was their
glory and strength, that the several tribes had no separate interests
when the common good was concerned.

[Judges 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 20:12</span></span>

Here is, I. The fair and just demand which the tribes of Israel, now
encamped, sent to the tribe of Benjamin, to deliver up the malefactors
of Gibeah to justice, [Jdg 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#012.md), [Jdg
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#013.md). If the tribe of Benjamin had
come up, as they ought to have done, to the assembly, and agreed with
them in their resolution, there would have been none to deal with but
the men of Gibeah only, but they, by their absence, taking part with the
criminals, application must be made to them all. The Israelites were
zealous against the wickedness that was committed, yet they were
discreet in their zeal, and did not think it would justify them in
falling upon the whole tribe of Benjamin unless they, by refusing to
give up the criminals, and protecting them against justice, should make
themselves guilty, ex post facto - as accessaries after the fact. They
desire them to consider how great the wickedness was that was committed
([Jdg 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#012).md), and that it was done
among them: and how necessary it was therefore that they should either
punish the malefactors with death themselves, according to the law of
Moses, or deliver them up to the general assembly, to be so much the
more publicly and solemnly punished, that evil might be put away from
Israel, the national guilt removed, the infection stopped by cutting off
the gangrened part, and national judgments prevented; for the sin was so
very like that of the Sodomites that they might justly fear, if they did
not punish it, God would rain hail from heaven upon them, as he did, not
only upon Sodom, but the neighbouring cities. If the Israelites had not
made this reasonable demand, they would have had much more reason to
lament the following desolations of Benjamin. All methods of
accommodation must be used before we go to war or go to law. The demand
was like that of Joab's to Abel, [Sa2
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#020.md), [Sa2
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#021.md). "Only deliver up the traitor,
and we will lay down our arms." On these terms, and no other, God will
be at peace with us, that we part with our sins, that we mortify and
crucify our lusts, and then all shall be well; his anger will be turned
away.

II\. The wretched obstinacy and perverseness of the men of Benjamin, who
seem to have been as unanimous and zealous in their resolutions to stand
by the criminals as the rest of the tribes were to punish them, so
little sense had they of their honour, duty, and interest. 1. They were
so prodigiously vile as to patronise the wickedness that was committed:
They would not hearken to the voice of their brethren ([Jdg
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#013).md), either because those of that
tribe were generally more vicious and debauched at this time than the
rest of the tribes, and therefore would not bear to have that punished
in others of which they knew themselves guilty (some of the most
fruitful and pleasant parts of Canaan fell to the lot of this tribe;
their land, like that of Sodom, was as the garden of the Lord, which
perhaps helped to make the inhabitants, like the men of Sodom, wicked,
and sinners before the Lord exceedingly, [Gen
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#010.md), [Gen
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#013).md), or because (as bishop Patrick
suggests) they took it ill that the other tribes should meddle with
their concerns; they would not do that which they knew was their duty
because they were reminded of it by their brethren, by whom they scorned
to be taught and controlled. If there were any wise men among them that
would have complied with the demand made, yet they were overpowered by
the majority, who thus made the crime of the men of Gibeah their own.
Thus we have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness if we say
A confederacy with those that have, and make ourselves guilty of other
men's sins by countenancing and defending them. It seems there is no
cause so bad but it will find some patrons, some advocates, to appear
for it; but woe be to those by whom such offences come. Those will have
a great deal to answer for that obstruct the course of necessary
justice, and strengthen the hands of the wicked, by saying, O wicked
man! thou shalt not die.

2\. They were so prodigiously vain and presumptuous as to make head
against the united force of all Israel. Never, surely, were men so
wretchedly infatuated as they were when they took up arms in opposition,
(1.) To so good a cause as Israel had. How could they expect to prosper
when they fought against justice, and consequently against the just God
himself, against those that had the high priest and the divine oracle on
their side, and so acted in downright rebellion against the sacred and
supreme authority of the nation. (2.) To so great a force as Israel had.
The disproportion of their numbers was much greater than that, [Luk
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#031.md), [Luk
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#032.md), where he that had but 10,000
durst not meet him that came against him with 20,000, and therefore
desired conditions of peace. There the enemy was but two to one, here
above fifteen to one; yet they despised conditions of peace. All the
forces they could bring into the field were but 26,000 men, besides 700
men of Gibeah ([Jdg 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#015).md); yet with
these they will dare to face 400,000 men of Israel, [Jdg
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#017.md). Thus sinners are infatuated to
their own ruin, and provoke him to jealousy who is infinitely stronger
than they, [Co1 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#022.md). But it should
seem they depended upon the skill of their men to make up what was
wanting in numbers, especially a regiment of slingers, 700 men, who,
though left-handed, were so dexterous at slinging stones that they would
not be a hair's breadth beside their mark, [Jdg
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#016.md). But these good marksmen were
very much out in their aim when they espoused this bad cause. Benjamin
signifies the son of the right hand, yet we find his posterity
left-handed.

[Judges 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 20:18</span></span>

We have here the defeat of the men of Israel in their first and second
battle with the Benjamites.

I. Before their first engagement they asked counsel of God concerning
the order of their battle and were directed, and yet they were sorely
beaten. They did not think it was proper to ask of God whether they
should go up at all against Benjamin (the case was plain enough, the men
of Gibeah must be punished for their wickedness, and Israel must inflict
the punishment or it will not be done), but "Who shall go first?" ([Jdg
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#018).md), that is, "Who shall be general
of our army?" for, which soever tribe was appointed to go first, the
prince of that tribe must be looked upon as commander-in-chief of the
whole body. For, if they had meant it of the order of their march only,
it would have been proper to ask, "Who shall go next?" and then, "Who
next?" But, if they know that Judah must go first, they know they must
all observe the orders of the prince of that tribe. This honour was done
to Judah because our Lord Jesus was to spring from that tribe, who was
in all things to have the pre-eminence. The tribe that went up first had
the most honourable post, but withal the most dangerous, and probably
lost most in the engagement. Who would strive for precedency that sees
the peril of it? Yet though Judah, that strong and valiant tribe, goes
up first, and all the tribes of Israel attend them, little Benjamin (so
he is called, [Psa 68:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#027).md), is too hard
for them all. The whole army lays siege to Gibeah, [Jdg
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#019.md). The Benjamites advance to raise
the siege, and the army prepares to give them a warm reception ([Jdg
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#020).md). But between the Benjamites
that attacked them in the front with incredible fury, and the men of
Gibeah that sallied out upon their rear, they were put into confusion
and lost 22,000 men, [Jdg 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#021.md). Here
were no prisoners taken, for there was no quarter given, but all put to
the sword.

II\. Before their second engagement they again asked counsel of God, and
more solemnly than before; for they wept before the Lord until evening
([Jdg 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#023).md), lamenting the loss of so
many brave men, especially as it was a token of God's displeasure and
would give occasion to the Benjamites to triumph in the success of their
wickedness. Also at this time they did not ask who should go up first,
but whether they should go up at all. The intimate a reason why they
should scruple to do it, especially now that Providence had frowned upon
them, because Benjamin was their brother, and a readiness to lay down
their arms if God should so order them. God bade them go up; he allowed
the attempt, for, though Benjamin was their brother, he was a gangrened
member of their body and must be cut off. Upon this they encouraged
themselves, perhaps more in their own strength than in the divine
commission, and made a second attempt upon the forces of the rebels, in
the same place where the former battle was fought ([Jdg
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#022).md), with the hope of retrieving
their credit upon the same spot of ground where they had lost it, which
they would not superstitiously change, as if there were any thing
unlucky in the place. But they were this second time repulsed, with the
loss of 18,000 men, [Jdg 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#025.md). The
former day's loss and this amounted to 40,000, which was just a tenth
part of the whole army, and the same number that they had drawn out by
lot to fetch victuals, [Jdg 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#010.md).
They decimated themselves for that service, and now God again decimated
them for the slaughter. But what shall we say to these things, that so
just and honourable a cause should thus be put to the worst once and
again? Were they not fighting God's battle against sin? Had they not his
commission? What, and yet miscarry thus! 1. God's judgments are a great
deep, and his way is in the sea. Clouds and darkness are often round
about him, but judgment and justice are always the habitation of his
throne. We may be sure of the righteousness, when we cannot see the
reasons, of God's proceedings. 2. God would hereby show them, and us in
them, that the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong,
that we are not to confide in numbers, which perhaps the Israelites did
with too much assurance. We must never lay the weight on an arm of
flesh, which only the Rock of ages will bear. 3. God designed hereby to
correct Israel for their sins. They did well to show such a zeal against
the wickedness of Gibeah: but were there not with them, even with them,
sins against the Lord their God? Those must be made to know their own
iniquity that are forward in condemning the iniquity of others. Some
think it was a rebuke to them for not witnessing against the idolatry of
Micah and the Danites, by which their religion was corrupted, as they
now did against the lewdness of Gibeah and the Benjamites, by which the
public peace was disturbed, though God had particularly ordered them to
levy war upon idolaters, [Deu 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#012.md),
etc. 4. God would hereby teach us not to think it strange if a good
cause should suffer defeat fore a while, nor to judge of the merits of
it by the success of it. The interest of grace in the heart, and of
religion in the world, may be foiled, and suffer great loss, and seem to
be quite run down, but judgment will be brought forth to victory at
last. Vincimur in praelio, sed non in bello - We are foiled in a battle,
but not in the whole campaign. Right may fall, but it shall arise.

[Judges 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jdg 20:26</span></span>

We have here a full account of the complete victory which the Israelites
obtained over the Benjamites in the third engagement: the righteous
cause was victorious at last, when the managers of it amended what had
been amiss; for, when a good cause suffers, it is for want of good
management. Observe then how the victory was obtained, and how it was
pursued.

I. How the victory was obtained. Two things they had trusted too much to
in the former engagements - the goodness of their cause and the
superiority of their numbers. It was true that they had both right and
strength on their side, which were great advantages; but they depended
too much upon them, to the neglect of those duties to which now, this
third time, when they see their error, they apply themselves.

1\. They were previously so confident of the goodness of their cause
that they thought it needless to address themselves to God for his
presence and blessing. They took it for granted that God would bless
them, nay, perhaps they concluded that he owed them his favour, and
could not in justice withhold it, since it was in defence of virtue that
they appeared and took up arms. But God having shown them that he was
under no obligation to prosper their enterprise, that he neither needed
them nor was tied to them, that they were more indebted to him for the
honour of being ministers of his justice than he to them for the
service, now they became humble petitioners for success. Before they
only consulted God's oracle, Who shall go up first? And, Shall we go up?
But now they implored his favour, fasted and prayed, and offered
burnt-offerings and peace-offerings ([Jdg
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#026).md), to make an atonement for sin
and an acknowledgment of their dependence upon God, and as an expression
of their desire towards him. We cannot expect the presence of God with
us, unless we thus seek it in the way he has appointed. And when they
were in this frame, and thus sought the Lord, then he not only ordered
them to go up against the Benjamites the third time, but gave them a
promise of victory: Tomorrow I will deliver them into thy hand, [Jdg
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#028.md).

2\. They were previously so confident of the greatness of their strength
that they thought it needless to use any art, to lay any ambush, or form
a stratagem, not doubting but to conquer purely by a strong hand; but
now they saw it was requisite to use some policy, as if they had an
enemy to deal with them that had been superior in number; accordingly,
they set liers in wait ([Jdg 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#029).md),
and gained their point, as their fathers did before Ai (Jos. 8),
stratagems of that kind being most likely to take effect after a
previous defeat, which has flushed the enemy, and made the pretended
flight the less suspected. The management of this artifice is here very
largely described. The assurance God had given them of success in this
day's action, instead of making them remiss and presumptuous, set all
heads and hands on work for the effecting of what God had promised.

(1.) Observe the method they took. The body of the army faced the city
of Gibeah, as they had done before, advancing towards the gates, [Jdg
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#030.md). The Benjamites, the body of
whose army was now quartered at Gibeah, sallied out upon them, and
charged them with great bravery. The besiegers gave back. retired with
precipitation, as if their hearts failed them upon the sight of the
Benjamites, which they were willing to believe, proudly imagining that
by their former success they had made themselves very formidable. Some
loss the Israelites sustained in this counterfeit flight, about thirty
men being cut off in their rear, [Jdg
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#031.md), [Jdg
20:39](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#039.md). But, when the Benjamites were
all drawn out of the city, the ambush seized the city ([Jdg
20:37](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#037).md), gave a signal to the body of
the army ([Jdg 20:38](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#038.md), [Jdg
20:40](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#040).md), which immediately turned upon
them ([Jdg 20:41](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#041).md), and, it should
seem, another considerable party that was posted at Baal-tamar came upon
them at the same time ([Jdg 20:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#033).md); so
that the Benjamites were quite surrounded, which put them into the
greatest consternation that could be. A sense of guilt now disheartened
them, and the higher their hopes had been raised the more grievous was
this confusion. At first the battle was sore ([Jdg
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#034).md), the Benjamites fought with
fury; but, when they saw what a snare they were drawn into, they thought
one pair of heels (as we say) was worth two pair of hands, and they made
the best of their way towards the wilderness ([Jdg
20:42](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#042).md); but in vain: the battle
overtook them, and, to complete their distress, those who came out of
the cities of Israel, that waited to see the event of the battle, joined
with their pursuers, and helped to cut them off. Every man's hand was
against them.

(2.) Observe in this story, \[1.\] That the Benjamites, in the beginning
of the battle, were confident that the day was their own: They are
smitten down before us, [Jdg 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#032.md),
[Jdg 20:39](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#039.md). Sometimes God suffers
wicked men to be lifted up in successes and hopes, that their fall may
be the sorer. See how short their joy is, and their triumphing but for a
moment. Let not him that girdeth on the harness boast, except he has
reason to boast in God. \[2.\] Evil was near them and they did not know
it, [Jdg 20:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#034.md). But ([Jdg
20:41](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#041).md) they saw, when it was too late
to prevent it, that evil had come upon them. What evils may at any time
be near us we cannot tell, but the less they are feared the heavier they
fall. Sinners will not be persuaded to see evil near them, but how
dreadful will it be when it comes and there is no escaping! [Th1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#003.md). \[3.\] Though the men of Israel
played their parts so well in this engagement, yet the victory is
ascribed to God ([Jdg 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#035).md): The Lord
smote Benjamin before Israel. The battle was his, and so was the
success. \[4.\] They trode down the men of Benjamin with ease when God
fought against them, [Jdg 20:43](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#043.md). It is
an easy thing to trample upon those who have made God their enemy. See
[Mal 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#003.md).

II\. How the victory was prosecuted and improved in a military execution
done upon these sinners against their own souls. 1. Gibeah itself, that
nest of lewdness, was destroyed in the first place. The ambush that
entered the city by surprise drew themselves along, that is, dispersed
themselves into the several parts of it, which they might easily do, now
that all the men of war had sallied out and very presumptuously left it
defenceless; and they smote all they found, even women and children,
with the sword ([Jdg 20:37](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#037).md), and set
fire to the city, [Jdg 20:40](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#040.md). Sin
brings ruin upon cities. 2. The army in the field was quite routed and
cut off: 18,000 men of valour lay dead upon the spot, [Jdg
20:44](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#044.md). 3. Those that escaped from the
field were pursued, and cut off in their flight, to the number of 7000,
[Jdg 20:45](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#045.md). It is to no purpose to
think of out-running divine vengeance. Evil pursues sinners, and it will
overtake them. 4. Even those that tarried at home were involved in the
ruin. They let their sword devour for ever, not considering that it
would be bitterness in the latter end, as Abner pleads long after, when
he was at the head of an army of Benjamites, probably with an eye to
this very story, [Sa2 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#025.md), [Sa2
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#026.md). They put to the sword all that
breathed, and set fire to all the cities, [Jdg
20:48](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#048.md). So that of all the tribe of
Benjamin, for aught that appears, there remained none alive but 600 men
that took shelter in the rock Rimmon, and lay close there four months,
[Jdg 20:47](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#047). Now, (1..md) It is difficult
to justify this severity as it was Israel's act. The whole tribe of
Benjamin was culpable; but must they therefore be treated as devoted
Canaanites? That it was done in the heat of war, that this was the way
of prosecuting victories which the sword of Israel had been accustomed
to, that the Israelites were extremely exasperated against the
Benjamites for the slaughter they had made among them in the two former
engagements, will go but a little way to excuse the cruelty of this
execution. It is true they had sworn that whosoever did not come up to
Mizpeh should be put to death, [Jdg
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#005.md). But that, if it was a
justifiable oath, yet extended only to the men of war; the rest were not
expected to come. Yet, (2.) It is easy to justify the hand of God in it.
Benjamin had sinner against him, and God had threatened that, if they
forgot him, they should perish as the nations that were before them
perished ([Deu 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#020).md), who were all in
this manner cut off. (3.) It is easy likewise to improve it for warning
against the beginnings of sin: they are like the letting forth of water,
therefore leave it off before it be meddled with, for we know not what
will be in the end thereof. The eternal ruin of souls will be worse, and
more fearful, than all these desolations of a tribe. This affair of
Gibeah is twice spoken of by the prophet Hosea as the beginning of the
corruption of Israel and a pattern to all that followed ([Hos
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#009).md): They have deeply corrupted
themselves as in the days of Gibeah; and ([Hos
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#009).md), Thou hast sinned from the days
of Gibeah; and it is added that the battle in Gibeah against the
children of iniquity did not (that is, did not at first) overtake them.
