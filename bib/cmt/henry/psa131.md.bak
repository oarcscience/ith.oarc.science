### [Psalms Chapter 131](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 131:0</span></span>

This psalm is David's profession of humility, humbly made, with
thankfulness to God for his grace, and not in vain-glory. It is probable
enough that (as most interpreters suggest) David made this protestation
in answer to the calumnies of Saul and his courtiers, who represented
David as an ambitious aspiring man, who, under pretence of a divine
appointment, sought the kingdom, in the pride of his heart. But he
appeals to God, that, on the contrary, I. He aimed at nothing high nor
great ([Psa 131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001).md). II. He was very
easy in every condition which God allotted him ([Psa
131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002).md); and therefore, III. He
encourages all good people to trust in God as he did ([Psa
131:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#003).md). Some have made it an objection
against singing David's psalms that there are many who cannot say, "My
heart is not haughty," etc. It is true there are; but we may sing it for
the same purpose that we read it, to teach and admonish ourselves, and
one another, what we ought to be, with repentance that we have come
short of being so, and humble prayer to God for his grace to make us so.

A song of degrees of David.

[Psalms 131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 131:1</span></span>

Here are two things which will be comforts to us: -

I. Consciousness of our integrity. This was David's rejoicing, that his
heart could witness for him that he had walked humbly with his God,
notwithstanding the censures he was under and the temptations he was in.

1\. He aimed not at a high condition, nor was he desirous of making a
figure in the world, but, if God had so ordered, could have been well
content to spend all his days, as he did in the beginning of them, in
the sheep-folds. His own brother, in a passion, charged him with pride
([Sa1 17:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#028).md), but the charge was
groundless and unjust. God, who searches the heart, knew, (1.) That he
had no conceited opinion of himself, or his own merits: Lord, my heart
is not haughty. Humble saints cannot think so well of themselves as
others think of them, are not in love with their own shadow, nor do they
magnify their own attainments or achievements. The love of God reigning
in the heart will subdue all inordinate self-love. (2.) That he had
neither a scornful nor an aspiring look: "My eyes are not lofty, either
to look with envy upon those that are above me or to look with disdain
upon those that are below me." Where there is a proud heart there is
commonly a proud look ([Pro 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#017).md), but
the humble publican will not so much as lift up his eyes. (3.) That he
did not employ himself in things above his station, in things too great
or too high for him. He did not employ himself in studies too high; he
made God's word his meditation, and did not amuse himself with matters
of nice speculation or doubtful disputation, or covet to be wise above
what is written. To know God and our duty is learning sufficiently high
for us. He did not employ himself in affairs too great; he followed his
ewes, and never set up for a politician; no, nor for a soldier; for,
when his brethren went to the wars, he staid at home to keep the sheep.
It is our wisdom, and will be our praise, to keep within our sphere, and
not to intrude into things which we have not seen, or meddle with that
which does not belong to us. Princes and scholars must not exercise
themselves in matters too great, too high, for men: and those in a low
station, and of ordinary capacities, must not pretend to that which is
out of their reach, and which they were not cut out for. Those will fall
under due shame that affect undue honours.

2\. He was well reconciled to every condition that God placed him in
([Psa 131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002).md): I have behaved and
quieted myself as a child that is weaned of his mother. As he had not
proudly aimed at the kingdom, so, since God had appointed him to it, he
had not behaved insolently towards any, nor been restless in his
attempts to get the crown before the time set; but, (1.) He had been as
humble as a little child about the age of a weanling, as manageable and
governable, and as far from aiming at high things; as entirely at God's
disposal as the child at the disposal of the mother or nurse; as far
from taking state upon him, though anointed to be king, or valuing
himself upon the prospect of his future advancement, as a child in the
arms. Our Saviour has taught us humility by this comparison ([Mat
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#003).md); we must become as little
children. (2.) He had been as indifferent to the wealth and honour of
this world as a child is to the breast when it is thoroughly weaned from
it. I have levelled and quieted myself (so Dr. Hammond reads it) as a
child that is weaned. This intimates that our hearts are naturally as
desirous of worldly things as the babe is of the breast, and in like
manner relish them, cry for them, are fond of them, play with them, and
cannot live without them. But, by the grace of God, a soul that is
sanctified, is weaned from those things. Providence puts wormwood upon
the breast, and that helps to wean us. The child is perhaps cross and
fretful while it is in the weaning and thinks itself undone when it has
lost the breast. But in a day or two it is forgotten; the fret is over,
and it accommodates itself well enough to a new way of feeding, cares no
longer for milk, but can bear strong meat. Thus does a gracious soul
quiet itself under the loss of that which it loved and disappointment in
that which it hoped for, and is easy whatever happens, lives, and lives
comfortably, upon God and the covenant-grace, when creatures prove dry
breasts. When our condition is not to our mind we must bring our mind to
our condition; and then we are easy to ourselves and all about us; then
our souls are as a weaned child.

II\. Confidence in God; and this David recommends to all Israel of God,
no doubt from his own experience of the benefit of it ([Psa
131:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#003).md): Let Israel hope in the Lord,
and let them continue to do so henceforth and for ever. Though David
could himself wait patiently and quietly for the crown designed him, yet
perhaps Israel, the people whose darling he was, would be ready to
attempt something in favour of him before the time; and therefore
endeavours to quiet them too, and bids them hope in the Lord that they
should see a happy change of the face of affairs in due time. Thus it is
good to hope and quietly to wait for the salvation of the Lord.
