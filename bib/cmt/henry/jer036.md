### [Jeremiah Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 36:0</span></span>

Here is another expedient tried to work upon this heedless and untoward
people, but it is tried in vain. A roll of a book is provided,
containing an abstract or abridgment of all the sermons that Jeremiah
had preached to them, that they might be put in mind of what they had
heard and might the better understand it, when they had it all before
them at one view. Now here we have, I. The writing of this roll by
Baruch, as Jeremiah dictated it ([Jer
36:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#001).md). II. The reading of the roll
by Baruch to all the people publicly on a fast-day (v. 5-10), afterwards
by Baruch to the princes privately (v. 11-19), and lastly by Jehudi to
the king (v. 20, 21). III. The burning of the roll by the king, with
orders to prosecute Jeremiah and Baruch ([Jer
36:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#022).md). IV. The writing of another
roll, with large additions, particularly of Jehoiakim's doom for burning
the former ([Jer 36:27-32](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#027).md).

[Jeremiah 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 36:1</span></span>

In the beginning of Ezekiel's prophecy we meet with a roll written in
vision, for discovery of the things therein contained to the prophet
himself, who was to receive and digest them, [Eze
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#009.md), [Eze
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#010.md); [Eze
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001.md). Here, in the latter end of
Jeremiah's prophecy, we meet with a roll written in fact, for discovery
of the things contained therein to the people, who were to hear and give
heed to them; for the written word and other good books are of great use
both to ministers and people. We have here,

I. The command which God gave to Jeremiah to write a summary of his
sermons, of all the reproofs and all the warnings he had given in God's
name to his people, ever since he first began to be a preacher, in the
thirteenth year of Josiah, to this day, which was in the fourth year of
Jehoiakim, [Jer 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#002.md), [Jer
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#003.md). What had been only spoken must
now be written, that it might be reviewed, and that it might spread the
further and last the longer. What had been spoken at large, with
frequent repetitions of the same things, perhaps in the same words
(which has its advantage one way), must now be contracted and put into
less compass, that the several parts of it might be better compared
together, which has its advantage another way. What they had heard once
must be recapitulated, and rehearsed to them again, that what was
forgotten might be called to mind again and what made no impression upon
them at the first hearing might take hold of them when they heard it the
second time. And what was perhaps already written, and published in
single sermons, must be collected into one volume, that none might be
lost. Note, The writing of the scripture is by divine appointment. And
observe the reason here given for the writing of this roll ([Jer
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#003).md): It may be the house of Judah
will hear. Not that the divine prescience was at any uncertainty
concerning the event: with that there is no peradventure; God knew
certainly that they would deal very treacherously, [Isa
48:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#008.md). But the divine wisdom directed
to this as a proper means for attaining the desired end: and, if it
failed, they would be the more inexcusable. And, though God foresaw that
they would not hear, he did not tell the prophet so, but prescribed this
method to him as a probably one to be used, in the hopes that they would
hear, that is, heed and regard what they heard, take notice of it and
mix faith with it: for otherwise our hearing the word, though an angel
from heaven were to read or preach it to us, would stand us in no stead.
Now observe here, 1. What it is hoped they will thus hear: All that evil
which I purpose to do unto them. Note, The serious consideration of the
certain fatal consequences of sin will be of great use to us to bring us
to God. 2. What it is hoped will be produced thereby: They will hear,
that they may return every man from his evil way. Note, The conversion
of sinners from their evil courses is that which ministers should aim at
in preaching; and people hear the word in vain if that point be not
gained with them. To what purpose do we hear of the evil God will bring
upon us for sin if we continue, notwithstanding, to do evil against him?
3. Of what vast advantage their consideration and conversion will be to
them: That I may forgive their iniquity. This plainly implies the honour
of God's justice, with which it is not consistent that he should forgive
the sin unless the sinner repent of it and turn from it; but it plainly
expresses the honour of his mercy, that he is very ready to forgive sin
and only waits till the sinner be qualified to receive forgiveness, and
therefore uses various means to bring us to repentance, that he may
forgive.

II\. The instructions which Jeremiah gave to Baruch his scribe, pursuant
to the command he had received from God, and the writing of the roll
accordingly, [Jer 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#004.md). God bade
Jeremiah write, but, it should seem, he had not the pen of a ready
writer, he could not write fast, or fair, so as Baruch could, and
therefore he made use of him as his amanuensis. St. Paul wrote but few
of his epistles with his own hand, [Gal
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#011.md); [Rom
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#022.md). God dispenses his gifts
variously; some have a good faculty at speaking, others at writing, and
neither can say to the other, We have no need of you, [Co1
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#021.md). The Spirit of God dictated to
Jeremiah, and he to Baruch, who had been employed by Jeremiah as trustee
for him in his purchase of the field ([Jer
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#012).md) and now was advanced to be his
scribe and substitute in his prophetical office; and, if we may credit
the apocryphal book that bears his name, he was afterwards himself a
prophet to the captives in Babylon. Those that begin low are likely to
rise high, and it is good for those that are designed for prophets to
have their education under prophets and to be serviceable to them.
Baruch wrote what Jeremiah dictated in a roll of a book on pieces of
parchment, or vellum, which were joined together, the top of one to the
bottom of the other, so making one long scroll, which was rolled perhaps
upon a staff.

III\. The orders which Jeremiah gave to Baruch to read what he had
written to the people. Jeremiah, it seems was shut up, and could not go
to the house of the Lord himself, [Jer
36:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#005.md). Though he was not a close
prisoner, for then there would have been no occasion to send officers to
seize him ([Jer 36:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#026).md), yet he was
forbidden by the king to appear in the temple, was shut out thence where
he might be serving God and doing good, which was as bad to him as if he
had been shut up in a dungeon. Jehoiakim was ripening apace for ruin
when he thus silenced God's faithful messengers. But, when Jeremiah
could not go to the temple himself, he sent one that was deputed by him
to read to the people what he would himself have said. Thus St. Paul
wrote epistles to the churches which he could not visit in person. Nay,
it was what he himself had often said to them. Note, The writing and
repeating of the sermons that have been preached may contribute very
much towards the answering of the great ends of preaching. what we have
heard and known it is good for us to hear again, that we may know it
better. To preach and write the same thing is safe and profitable, and
many times very necessary ([Phi 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#001).md),
and we must be glad to hear a good word from God, though we have it, as
here, at second hand. Both ministers and people must do what they can
when they cannot do what they would. Observe, When God ordered the
reading of the roll he said, It may be they will hear and return from
their evil ways, [Jer 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#003.md). When
Jeremiah orders it, he says, It may be they will pray (they will present
their supplications before the Lord) and will return from their evil
way. Note, Prayer to God for grace to turn us is necessary in order to
our turning; and those that are convinced by the word of God of the
necessity of returning to him will present their supplications to him
for that grace. And the consideration of this, that great is the anger
which God has pronounced against us for sin, should quicken both our
prayers and our endeavours. Now, according to these orders, Baruch did
read out of the book the words of the Lord, whenever there was a holy
convocation, [Jer 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#008.md).

[Jeremiah 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 36:9</span></span>

It should seem that Baruch had been frequently reading out of the book,
to all companies that would give him the hearing, before the most solemn
reading of it altogether which is here spoken of; for the directions
were given about it in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, whereas this was
done in the fifth year, [Jer 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#009.md). But
some think that the writing of the book fairly over took up so much time
that it was another year ere it was perfected; and yet perhaps it might
not be past a month or two; he might begin in the latter end of the
fourth year and finish it in the beginning of the fifth, for thee ninth
month refers to the computation of the year in general, not to the year
of that reign. Now observe here, 1. The government appointed a public
fast to be religiously observed ([Jer
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#009).md), on account either of the
distress they were brought into by the army of the Chaldeans or of the
want of rain ([Jer 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#001).md): They
proclaimed a fast to the people; whether the king and princes or the
priests, ordered this fast, is not certain; but it was plain that God by
his providence called them aloud to it. Note, Great shows of piety and
devotion may be found even among those who, though they keep up these
forms of godliness, are strangers and enemies to the power of it. But
what will such hypocritical services avail? Fasting, without reforming
and turning away from sin, will never turn away the judgments of God,
[Jon 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#010.md). Notwithstanding this fast,
God proceeded in his controversy with this people. 2. Baruch repeated
Jeremiah's sermons publicly in the house of the Lord, on the fast-day.
He stood in a chamber that belonged to Gemariah, and out of a window, or
balcony, read to the people that were in the court, [Jer
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#010.md). Note, When we are speaking to
God we must be willing to hear from him; and therefore, on days of
fasting and prayer, it is requisite that the word be read and preached.
Hearken unto me, that God may hearken unto you. [Jdg
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#007.md). For our help in suing out mercy
and grace, it is proper that we should be told of sin and duty. 3. An
account was brought of this to the princes that attended the court and
were now together in the secretary's office, here called the scribe's
chamber, [Jer 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#012.md). It should seem,
though the princes had called the people to meet in the house of God, to
fact, and pray, and hear the word, they did not think fit to attend
there themselves, which was a sign that it was not from a principle of
true devotion, but merely for fashion sake, that they proclaimed this
fast. We are willing to hope that it was not with a bad design, to bring
Jeremiah into trouble for his preaching, but with a good design, to
bring the princes into trouble for their sins, that Michaiah informed
the princes of what Baruch had read; for his father Gemariah so far
countenanced Baruch as to lend him his chamber to read out of. Michaiah
finds the princes sitting in the scribe's chamber, and tells them they
had better have been where he had been, hearing a good sermon in the
temple, which he gives them the heads of. Note, When we have heard some
good word that has affected and edified us we should be ready to
communicate it to others that did not hear it, for their edification.
Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. 4. Baruch is sent
for, and is ordered to sit down among them and read it all over again to
them ([Jer 36:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#014.md), [Jer
36:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#015).md), which he readily did, not
complaining that he was weary with his public work and therefore
desiring to be excused, nor upbraiding the princes with their being
absent from the temple, where they might have heard it when he read it
there. Note, God's ministers must become all things to all men, if by
any means they may gain some, must comply with them in circumstances,
that they may secure the substance. St. Paul preached privately to those
of reputation, [Gal 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#002.md). 5. The
princes were for the present much affected with the word that was read
to them, [Jer 36:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#016.md). Observe, They
heard all the words they did not interrupt him, but very patiently
attended to the reading of the whole book; for otherwise how could they
form a competent judgment of it? And, when they had heard all, they were
afraid, were all afraid, one as well as another; like Felix, who
trembled at Paul's reasonings. The reproofs were just, the threatenings
terrible, and the predictions now in a fair way to be fulfilled; so
that, laying all together, they were in a great consternation. We are
not told what impressions this reading of the roll made upon the people
([Jer 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#010).md), but the princes were put
into a fright by it, and (as some read it) looked one upon another, not
knowing what to say. They were all convinced that it was worthy to be
regarded, but none of them had courage to second it, only they agreed to
tell the king of all these words; and, if he think fit to give credit to
them, they will, otherwise not, no, though it were to prevent the ruin
of the nation. And yet at the same time they knew the king's mind so far
that they advised Baruch and Jeremiah to hide themselves ([Jer
36:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#019).md) and to shift as they could for
their own safety, expecting no other than that the king, instead of
being convinced, would be exasperated. Note, It is common for sinners,
under convictions, to endeavour to shake them off, by shifting off the
prosecution of them to other persons, as these princes here, or to
another more convenient season, as Felix. 6. They asked Baruch a
trifling question, How he wrote all these words (v. 17), as if they
suspected there was something extraordinary in it; but Baruch gives them
a plain answer, that there was nothing but what was common in the manner
of the writing - Jeremiah dictated and he wrote, [Jer
36:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#018.md). But thus it is common for those
who would avoid the convictions of the word of God to start needless
questions about the way and manner of the inspiration of it.

[Jeremiah 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 36:20</span></span>

We have traced the roll to the people, and to the princes, and here we
are to follow it to the king; and we find,

I. That, upon notice given him concerning it, he sent for it, and
ordered it to be read to him, [Jer
36:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#020.md), [Jer
36:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#021.md). He did not desire that Baruch
would come and read it himself, who could read it more intelligently and
with more authority and affection than any one else; nor did he order
one of his princes to do it (though it would have been no disparagement
to the greatest of them), much less would he vouchsafe to read it
himself; but Jehudi, one of his pages now in waiting, who was sent to
fetch it, is bidden to read it, who perhaps scarcely knew how to make
sense of it. But those who thus despise the word of God will soon make
it to appear, as this king did, that they hate it too, and have not only
low, but ill thoughts of it.

II\. That he had not patience to hear it read through as the princes
had, but, when he had heard three or four leaves read, in a rage he cut
it with his penknife, and threw it piece by piece into the fire, that he
might be sure to see it all consumed, [Jer
36:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#022.md), [Jer
36:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#023.md). This was a piece of as daring
impiety as a man could lightly be guilty of, and a most impudent affront
to the God of heaven, whose message this was. 1. Thus he showed his
impatience of reproof; being resolved to persist in sin, he would by no
means bear to be told of his faults. 2. Thus he showed his indignation
at Baruch and Jeremiah; he would have cut them in pieces, and burnt
them, if he had had them in his reach, when he was in this passion. 3.
Thus he expressed an abstinent resolution never to comply with the
designs and intentions of the warnings given him; he will do what he
will, whatever God by his prophets says to the contrary. 4. Thus he
foolishly hoped to defeat the threatenings denounced against him, as if
God knew not how to execute the sentence when the roll was gone in which
it was written. 5. Thus he thought he had effectually provided that the
things contained in this roll should spread no further, which was the
care of the chief priests concerning the gospel, [Act
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#017.md). They had told him how this roll
had been read to the people and to the princes. "But," says he, "I will
take a course that shall prevent its being read any more." See what an
enmity there is against God in the carnal mind, and wonder at the
patience of God, that he bears with such indignities done to him.

III\. That neither the king himself nor any of his princes were at all
affected with the word: They were not afraid ([Jer
36:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#024).md), no, not those princes that
trembled at the word when they heard it the first time, [Jer
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#016.md). So soon, so easily, do good
impressions wear off. They showed some concern till they saw how light
the king made of it, and then they shook off all that concern. They rent
not their garments, as Josiah, this Jehoiakim's own father, did when he
had the book of the law read to him, though it was not so particular as
the contents of this roll were, nor so immediately adapted to the
present posture of affairs.

IV\. That there were three of the princes who had so much sense and
grace left as to interpose for the preventing of the burning of the
roll, but in vain, [Jer 36:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#025.md). If they
had from the first shown themselves, as they ought to have done,
affected with the word, perhaps they might have brought the king to a
better mind and have persuaded him to bear it patiently; but frequently
those that will not do the good they should put it out of their own
power to do the good they would.

V. That Jehoiakim, when he had thus in effect burnt God's warrant by
which he was arrested, as it were in a way of revenge, now that he
thought he had got the better, signed a warrant for the apprehending of
Jeremiah and Baruch, God's ministers ([Jer
36:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#026).md): But the Lord hid them. The
princes bade them abscond ([Jer
36:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#019).md), but it was neither the
princes' care for them nor theirs for themselves that secured them; it
was under the divine protection that they were safe. Note, God will find
out a shelter for his people, though their persecutors be ever so
industrious to get them into their power, till their hour be come; nay,
and then he will himself be their hiding place.

VI\. That Jeremiah had orders and instructions to write in another roll
the same words that were written in the roll which Jehoiakim had burnt,
[Jer 36:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#027.md), [Jer
36:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#028.md). Note, Though the attempts of
hell against the word of God are very daring, yet not one iota or tittle
of it shall fall to the ground, nor shall the unbelief of man make the
word of God of no effect. Enemies may prevail to burn many a Bible, but
they cannot abolish the word of God, can neither extirpate it nor defeat
the accomplishment of it. Though the tables of the law were broken, they
were renewed again; and so out of the ashes of the roll that was burnt
arose another Phoenix. The word of the Lord endures for ever.

VII\. That the king of Judah, though a king, was severely reckoned with
by the King of kings for this indignity done to the written word. God
noticed what it was in the roll that Jehoiakim took so much offense at.
Jehoiakim was angry because it was written therein, saying, Surely the
king of Babylon shall come and destroy this land, [Jer
36:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#029.md). And did not the king of Babylon
come two years before this, and go far towards the destroying of this
land? He did so ([Ch2 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#006.md), [Ch2
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#007).md) in his third year, [Dan
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md). So that God and his prophets had
therefore become his enemies because they told him the truth, told him
of the desolation that was coming, but at the same time putting him into
a fair way to prevent it. But, if this be the thing he takes so much
amiss, let him know, 1. That the wrath of God shall come upon him and
his family, in the first place, by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar. He shall
be cut off, and in a few weeks his son shall be dethroned, and exchange
his royal robes for prison-garments, so that he shall have none to sit
upon the throne of David; the glory of that illustrious house shall be
eclipsed, and die in him; his dead body shall lie unburied, or, which
comes all to one, he shall be buried with the burial of an ass, that is,
thrown into the next ditch; it shall lie exposed to all weathers, heat
and frost, which will occasion its putrefying and becoming loathsome the
sooner. "Not that his body" (says Mr. Gataker) "could be sensible of
such usage, or himself, being deceased, of aught that should befal his
body; but that the king's body in such a condition should be a hideous
spectacle, and a horrid monument of God's heavy wrath and indignation
against him, unto all that should behold it." Even his seed and his
servants shall fare the worse for their relation to him ([Jer
36:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#031).md), for they shall be punished,
not for his iniquity, but so much the sooner for their own. 2. That all
the evil pronounced against Judah and Jerusalem in that roll shall be
brought upon them. Though the copy be burnt, the original remains in the
divine counsel, which shall again be copied out after another manner in
bloody characters. Note, There is no escaping God's judgments by
struggling with them. Who ever hardened his heart against God, and
prospered?

VIII\. That, when the roll was written anew, there were added to the
former many like words ([Jer 36:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#032).md),
many more threatenings of wrath and vengeance; for, since they will yet
walk contrary to God, he will heat the furnace seven times hotter. Note,
As God is in one mind, and none can turn him, so he has still more
arrows in his quiver; and those who contend with God's woes do but
prepare for themselves heavier of the same kind.
