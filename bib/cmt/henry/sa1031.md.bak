### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 31:0</span></span>

In the foregoing chapter we had David conquering, yea, more than a
conqueror. In this chapter we have Saul conquered and worse than a
captive. Providence ordered it that both these things should be doing
just at the same time. The very same day; perhaps, that David was
triumphing over the Amalekites, were the Philistines triumphing over
Saul. One is set over against the other, that men may see what comes of
trusting in God and what comes of forsaking him. We left Saul ready to
engage the Philistines, with a shaking hand and an aching heart, having
had his doom read him from hell, which he would not regard when it was
read him from heaven. Let us now see what becomes of him. Here is, I.
His army routed ([Sa1 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#001).md). II. His
three sons slain ([Sa1 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#002).md). III.
Himself wounded ([Sa1 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#003).md), and slain
by his own hand ([Sa1 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#004).md). The death
of his armour-bearer ([Sa1 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#005).md) and
all his men ([Sa1 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#006).md). IV. His
country possessed by the Philistines ([Sa1
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#007).md). His camp plundered, and his
dead body deserted ([Sa1 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#008).md). His
fall triumphed in ([Sa1 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#009).md). His
body publicly exposed ([Sa1 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#010).md) and
with difficulty rescued by the men of Jabesh-Gilead ([Sa1
31:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#011).md). Thus fell the man that was
rejected of God.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 31:1</span></span>

The day of recompence has now come, in which Saul must account for the
blood of the Amalekites which he had sinfully spared, and that of the
priests which he had more sinfully spilt; that of David too, which he
would have spilt, must come into the account. Now his day has come to
fall, as David foresaw, when he should descend into battle and perish,
[Sa1 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#010.md). Come and see the righteous
judgments of God.

I. He sees his soldiers fall about him, [Sa1
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#001.md). Whether the Philistines were
more numerous, better posted, and better led on, or what other
advantages they had, we are not told; but it seems they were more
vigorous, for they made the onset; they fought against Israel, and the
Israelites fled and fell. The best of the troops were put into disorder,
and multitudes slain, probably those whom Saul had employed in pursuing
David. Thus those who had followed him and served him in his sin went
before him in his fall and shared with him in his plagues.

II\. He sees his sons fall before him. The victorious Philistines
pressed most forcibly upon the king of Israel and those about him. His
three sons were next him, it is probable, and they were all three slain
before his face, to his great grief (for they were the hopes of his
family) and to his great terror, for they were now the guard of his
person, and he could conclude no other than that his own turn would come
next. His sons are named ([Sa1 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#002).md),
and it grieves us to find Jonathan among them: that wise, valiant, good
man, who was as much David's friend as Saul was his enemy, yet falls
with the rest. Duty to his father would not permit him to stay at home,
or to retire when the armies engaged; and Providence so orders it that
he falls in the common fate of his family, though he never involved
himself in the guilt of it; so that the observation of Eliphaz does not
hold ([Job 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#007).md), Who ever perished
being innocent? For here was one. What shall we say to it? 1. God would
hereby complete the vexation of Saul in his dying moments, and the
judgment that was to be executed upon his house. If the family must
fall, Jonathan, that is one of it, must fall with it. 2. He would hereby
make David's way to the crown the more clear and open. For, though
Jonathan himself would have cheerfully resigned all his title and
interest to him (we have no reason to suspect any other), yet it is very
probable that many of the people would have made use of his name for the
support of the house of Saul, or at least would have come in but slowly
to David. If Ishbosheth (who was now left at home as one unfit for
action, and so escaped) had so many friends, what would Jonathan have
had, who had been the darling of the people and had never forfeited
their favour? Those that were so anxious to have a king like the nations
would be zealous for the right line, especially if that threw the crown
upon such a head as Jonathan's. This would have embarrassed David; and,
if Jonathan could have prevailed to bring in all his interest to David,
then it would have been said that Jonathan had made him king, whereas
God was to have all the glory. This is the Lord's doing. So that though
the death of Jonathan would be a great affliction to David, yet, by
making him mindful of his own frailty, as well as by facilitating his
accession to the throne, it would be an advantage to him. 3. God would
hereby show us that the difference between good and bad is to be made in
the other world, not in this. All things come alike to all. We cannot
judge of the spiritual or eternal state of any by the manner of their
death; for in that there is one event to the righteous and to the
wicked.

III\. He himself is sorely wounded by the Philistines and then slain by
his own hand. The archers hit him ([Sa1
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#003).md), so that he could neither fight
nor fly, and therefore must inevitably fall into their hands. Thus, to
make him the more miserable, destruction comes gradually upon him, and
he dies so as to feel himself die. To such an extremity was he now
reduced that, 1. He was desirous to die by the hand of his own servant
rather than by the hand of the Philistines, lest they should abuse him
as they had abused Samson. Miserable man! He finds himself dying, and
all his care is to keep his body out of the hands of the Philistines,
instead of being solicitous to resign his soul into the hands of God who
gave it, [Ecc 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007.md). As he lived, so he
died, proud and jealous, and a terror to himself and all about him.
Those who rightly understand the matter think it of small account, in
comparison, how it is with them in death, so it may but be well with
them after death. Those are in a deplorable condition indeed who, being
bitter in soul, long for death, but it cometh not ([Job
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#020.md), [Job
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#021).md), especially those who,
despairing of the mercy of god, like Judas, leap into a hell before
them, to escape a hell within them. 2. When he could not obtain that
favour he became his own executioner, thinking hereby to avoid shame,
but running upon a heinous sin, and with it entailing upon his own name
a mark of perpetual infamy, as felo de se - a self-murderer. Jonathan,
who received his death-wound from the hand of the Philistines and
bravely yielded to the fate of war, died on the bed of honour; but Saul
died as a fool dieth, as a coward dieth - a proud fool, a sneaking
coward; he died as a man that had neither the fear of God nor hope in
God, neither the reason of a man nor the religion of an Israelite, much
less the dignity of a prince or the resolution of a soldier. Let us all
pray, Lord, lead us not into temptation, this temptation. His
armour-bearer would not run him through, and he did well to refuse it;
for no man's servant ought to be a slave to his master's lusts or
passions of any kind. The reason given is that he was sorely afraid, not
of death, for he himself ran wilfully upon that immediately; but, having
a profound reverence for the king his master, he could not conquer that
so far as to do him any hurt; or perhaps he feared lest his trembling
hand should give him but half a blow, and so put him to the greater
misery.

IV\. His armour-bearer who refused to kill him refused not to die with
him, but fell likewise upon his sword, [Sa1
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#005.md). This was an aggravating
circumstance of the death of Saul, that, by the example of his
wickedness in murdering himself, he drew in his servant to be guilty of
the same wickedness, and perished not alone in his iniquity. The Jews
say that Saul's armour-bearer was Doeg, whom he preferred to that
dignity for killing the priests, and, if so, justly does his violent
dealing return on his own head. David had foretold concerning him that
God would destroy him for ever, [Psa
52:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#005.md).

V. The country was put into such confusion by the rout of Saul's army
that the inhabitants of the neighbouring cities (on that side Jordan, as
it might be read) quitted them, and the Philistines, for a time, had
possession of them, till things were settled in Israel ([Sa1
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#007).md), to such a sad pass had Saul by
his wickedness brought his country, which might have remained in the
hands of the uncircumcised if David had not been raised up to repair the
breaches of it. See what a king he proved for whom they rejected God and
Samuel. They had still done wickedly (it is to be feared) as well as he,
and therefore were consumed both they and their king, as the prophet had
foretold concerning them, [Sa1 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#025.md).
And to this reference is had long after. [Hos
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#010.md), [Hos
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#011.md), "Where are thy saviours in all
thy cities, of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes? I gave thee
a king in my anger, and took him away in my wrath; that is, he was a
plague to thee living and dying; thou couldst expect no other."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 31:8</span></span>

The scripture makes no mention of the souls of Saul and his sons, what
became of them after they were dead (secret things belong not to us),
but of their bodies only.

I. How they were basely abused by the Philistines. The day after the
battle, when they had recovered their fatigue, they came to strip the
slain, and, among the rest, found the bodies of Saul and his three sons,
[Sa1 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#008.md). Saul's armour-bearer
perhaps intended to honour his master by following the example of his
self-murder, and to show thereby how well he loved him; but, if he had
consulted his reason more than his passions, he would have spared that
foolish compliment, not only in justice to his own life, but in kindness
to his master, to whom, by the opportunity of survivorship, he might
have done all the service that could be done him by any man after he was
dead; for he might, in the night, have conveyed away his body, and those
of his sons, and buried them decently. But such false and foolish
notions these vain men have (though they would be wise) of giving and
receiving honour. Nay, it should seem, Saul might have saved himself the
fatal thrust and have made his escape: for the pursuers (in fear of whom
he slew himself) came not to the place where he was till the next day.
But whom God will destroy he infatuates and utterly consumes with his
terrors. See [Job 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#005.md), etc. Finding
Saul's body (which now that it lay extended on the bloody turf was
distinguishable from the rest by its length, as it was, while erect, by
its height, when he proudly overlooked the surrounding crowd), they
will, in that, triumph over Israel's crown, and meanly gratify a
barbarous and brutish revenge by insulting the deserted corpse, which,
when alive, they had stood in awe of. 1. They cut off his head. Had they
designed in this to revenge the cutting off of Goliath's head they would
rather have cut off the head of David, who did that execution, when he
was in their country. They intended it, in general, for a reproach to
Israel, who promised themselves that a crowned and an anointed head
would save them from the Philistines, and a particular reproach to Saul,
who was taller by the head than other men (which perhaps he was wont to
boast of), but was now shorter by the head. 2. They stripped him of his
armour ([Sa1 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#009).md), and sent that to
be set up as a trophy of their victory, in the house of Ashtaroth their
goddess ([Sa1 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#010).md); and we are told,
[Ch1 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#010.md) (though it is omitted
here), that they fastened his head in the temple of Dagon. Thus did they
ascribe the honour of their victory, not as they ought to have done to
the real justice of the true God, but to the imaginary power of their
false gods, and by this respect paid to pretended deities shame those
who give not the praise of their achievements to the living God.
Ashtaroth, the idol that Israel had many a time gone a whoring after,
now triumphs over them. 3. They sent expresses throughout their country,
and ordered public notice to be given in the houses of their gods of the
victory they had obtained ([Sa1 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#009).md),
that public rejoicings might be made and thanks given to their gods.
This David regretted sorely, [Sa2
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#020.md). Tell it not in Gath. 4. They
fastened his body and the bodies of his sons (as appears, [Sa1
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#012).md) to the wall of Bethshan, a city
that lay not far from Gilboa and very near to the river Jordan. Hither
the dead bodies were dragged and here hung up in chains, to be devoured
by the birds of prey. Saul slew himself to avoid being abused by the
Philistines, and never was royal corpse so abused as his was, perhaps
the more if they understood that he slew himself for that reason. He
that thinks to save his honour by sin will certainly lose it. See to
what a height of insolence the Philistines had arrived just before David
was raised up, who perfectly subdued them. Now that they had slain Saul
and his sons they thought the land of Israel was their own for ever, but
they soon found themselves deceived. When God has accomplished his whole
work by them he will accomplish it upon them. See [Isa
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#006.md), [Isa
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#007.md).

II\. How they were bravely rescued by the men of Jabesh-Gilead. Little
more than the river Jordan lay between Beth-shan and Jabesh-Gilead, and
Jordan was in that place passable by its fords; a bold adventure was
therefore made by the valiant men of that city, who in the night passed
the river, took down the dead bodies, and gave them decent burial, [Sa1
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#011.md), [Sa1
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#013.md). This they did, 1. Out of a
common concern for the honour of Israel, or the land of Israel, which
ought not to be defiled by the exposing of any dead bodies, and
especially of the crown of Israel, which was thus profaned by the
uncircumcised. 2. Out of a particular sense of gratitude to Saul, for
his zeal and forwardness to rescue them from the Ammonites when he first
came to the throne, [Sa1 11:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001.md). It
is an evidence of a generous spirit and an encouragement to beneficence
when the remembrance of kindnesses is thus retained, and they are thus
returned in an extremity. The men of Jabesh-Gilead would have done Saul
better service if they had sent their valiant men to him sooner, to
strengthen him against the Philistines. But his day had come to fall,
and now this is all the service they can do him, in honour to his
memory. We find not that any general mourning was made for the death of
Saul, as was for the death of Samuel ([Sa1
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#001).md), only those Gileadites of Jabesh
did him honour at his death; for, (1.) They made a burning for the
bodies, to perfume them. So some understand the burning of them. They
burnt spices over them, [Sa1 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#012.md).
And that it was usual thus to do honour to their deceased friends, at
least their princes, appears by the account of Asa's funeral ([Ch2
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#014).md), that they made a very great
burning for him. Or (as some think) they burnt the flesh, because it
began to putrefy. (2.) They buried the bodies, when, by burning over
them, they had sweetened them (or, if they burnt them, they buried the
bones and ashes), under a tree, which served for a grave-stone and
monument. And, (3.) They fasted seven days, that is, each day of the
seven they fasted till the evening; thus they lamented the death of Saul
and the present distracted state of Israel, and perhaps joined prayers
with their fasting for the re-establishment of their shattered state.
Though, when the wicked perish there is shouting (that is, it is to be
hoped a better state of things will ensue, which will be matter of joy),
yet humanity obliges us to show a decent respect to dead bodies,
especially those of princes.

This book began with the birth of Samuel, but now it ends with the
burial of Saul, the comparing of which two together will teach us to
prefer the honour that comes from God before any of the honours which
this world pretends to have the disposal of.
