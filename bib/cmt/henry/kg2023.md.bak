[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 23:0</span></span>

We have here, I. The happy continuance of the goodness of Josiah's
reign, and the progress of the reformation he began, reading the law
([Kg2 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#001.md), [Kg2
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#002).md), renewing the covenant ([Kg2
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#003).md), cleansing the temple ([Kg2
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#004).md), and rooting out idols and
idolatry, with all the relics thereof, in all places, as far as his
power reached (v. 5-20), keeping a solemn passover ([Kg2
23:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#021).md), and clearing the country of
witches ([Kg2 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#024).md); and in all this
acting with extraordinary vigour ([Kg2
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#025).md). II. The unhappy conclusion of
it in his untimely death, as a token of the continuance of God's wrath
against Jerusalem ([Kg2 23:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#026).md).
III. The more unhappy consequences of his death, in the bad reigns of
his two sons Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim, that came after him ([Kg2
23:31-37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#031).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 23:1</span></span>

Josiah had received a message from God that there was no preventing the
ruin of Jerusalem, but that he should deliver only his own soul; yet he
did not therefore sit down in despair, and resolve to do nothing for his
country because he could not do all he would. No, he would do his duty,
and then leave the event to God. A public reformation was the thing
resolved on; if any thing could prevent the threatened ruin it must be
that; and here we have the preparations for that reformation. 1. He
summoned a general assembly of the states, the elders, the magistrates
or representatives of Judah and Jerusalem, to meet him in the house of
the Lord, with the priests and prophets, the ordinary and extraordinary
ministers, that, they all joining in it, it might become a national act
and so be the more likely to prevent national judgments; they were all
called to attend ([Kg2 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#001.md), [Kg2
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#002).md), that the business might be done
with the more solemnity, that they might all advise and assist in it,
and that those who were against it might be discouraged from making any
opposition. Parliaments are no diminution at all to the honour and power
of good princes, but a great support to them. 2. Instead of making a
speech to this convention, he ordered the book of the law to be read to
them; nay, it should seem, he read it himself ([Kg2
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#002).md), as one much affected with it
and desirous that they should be so too. Josiah thinks it not below him
to be a reader, any more than Solomon did to be a preacher, nay, and
David himself to be a door-keeper in the house of God. Besides the
convention of the great men, he had a congregation of the men of Judah
and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to hear the law read. It is really the
interest of princes to promote the knowledge of the scriptures in their
dominions. If the people be but as stedfastly resolved to obey by law as
he is to govern by law, the kingdom will be happy. All people are
concerned to know the scripture, and all in authority to spread the
knowledge of it. 3. Instead of proposing laws for the confirming of them
in their duty, he proposed an association by which they should all
jointly engage themselves to God, [Kg2
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#003.md). The book of the law was the book
of the covenant, that, if they would be to God a people, he would be to
them a God; they here engage themselves to do their part, not doubting
but that then God would do his. (1.) The covenant was that they should
walk after the Lord, in compliance with his will, in his ordinances and
his providences, should answer all his calls and attend all his motions
- that they should make conscience of all his commandments, moral,
ceremonial, and judicial, and should carefully observe them with all
their heart and all their soul, with all possible care and caution,
sincerity, vigour, courage, and resolution, and so fulfil the conditions
of this covenant, in dependence upon the promises of it. (2.) The
covenanters were, in the first place, the king himself, who stood by his
pillar ([Kg2 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#014).md) and publicly
declared his consent to this covenant, to set them an example, and to
assure them not only of his protection but of his presidency and all the
furtherance his power could give them in their obedience. It is no
abridgment of the liberty even of princes themselves to be in bonds to
God. All the people likewise stood to the covenant, that is, they
signified their consent to it and promised to abide by it. It is of good
use to oblige ourselves to our duty with all possible solemnity, and
this is especially seasonable after notorious backslidings to sin and
decays in that which is good. He that bears an honest mind does not
shrink from positive engagements: fast bind, fast find.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 23:4</span></span>

We have here an account of such a reformation as we have not met with in
all the history of the kings of Judah, such thorough riddance made of
all the abominable things and such foundations laid of a glorious good
work; and here I cannot but wonder at two things: - 1. That so many
wicked things should have got in, and kept standing so long, as we find
here removed. 2. That notwithstanding the removal of these wicked
things, and the hopeful prospects here given of a happy settlement, yet
within a few years Jerusalem was utterly destroyed, and even this did
not save it; for the generality of the people, after all, hated to be
reformed. The founder melteth in vain, and therefore reprobate silver
shall men call them, [Jer 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#029.md), [Jer
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#030.md). Let us here observe,

I. What abundance of wickedness there was, and had been, in Judah and
Jerusalem. One would not have believed it possible that in Judah, where
God was known - in Israel, where his name was great - in Salem, in Sion,
where his dwelling place was, such abominations should be found as here
we have an account of. Josiah had now reigned eighteen years, and had
himself set the people a good example, and kept up religion according to
law; and yet, when he came to make inquisition for idolatry, the depth
and extent of the dunghill he had to carry away appeared almost
incredible. 1. Even in the house of the Lord, that sacred temple which
Solomon built, and dedicated to the honour and for the worship of the
God of Israel, there were found vessels, all manner of utensils, for the
worship of Baal, and of the grove (or Ashtaroth), and of all the host of
heaven, [Kg2 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#004.md). Though Josiah had
suppressed the worship of idols, yet the utensils made for that worship
were all carefully preserved, even in the temple itself, to be used
again whenever the present restraint should be taken off; nay, even the
grove itself, the image of it, was yet standing in the temple ([Kg2
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#006).md); some make it the image of
Venus, the same with Ashtaroth. 2. Just at the entering in of the house
of the Lord was a stable for horses kept (would you think it?) for a
religious use; they were holy horses, given to the sun ([Kg2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011).md), as if he needed them who
rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race ([Psa
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#005).md), or rather they would thus
represent to themselves the swiftness of his motion, which they much
admired, making their religion to conform to the poetical fictions of
the chariot of the sun, the follies of which even a little philosophy,
without any divinity, would have exposed and made them ashamed of. Some
say that those horses were to be led forth in pomp every morning to meet
the rising sun, others that the worshippers of the sun rode out upon
them to adore the rising sun; it should seem that they drew the chariots
of the sun, which the people worshipped. Strange that ever men who had
the written word of God among them should be thus vain in their
imaginations! 3. Hard by the house of the Lord there were houses of the
Sodomites, where all manner of lewdness and filthiness, even that which
was most unnatural, was practised, and under pretence of religion too,
in honour of their impure deities. Corporal and spiritual whoredom went
together, and the vile affections to which the people were given up were
the punishment of their vain imaginations. Those that dishonoured their
God were justly left thus to dishonour themselves, [Rom
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024.md), etc. There were women that wove
hangings for the grove ([Kg2 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#007).md),
tents which encompassed the image of Venus, where the worshippers
committed all manner of lewdness, and this in the house of the Lord.
Those did ill that made our Father's house a house of merchandise; those
did worse that made it a den of thieves; but those did worst of all that
made it (Horrendum dictu! - Horrible to relate!) a brothel, in an
impudent defiance of the holiness of God and of his temple. Well might
the apostle call them abominable idolatries. 4. There were many
idolatrous altars found ([Kg2 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#012).md),
some in the palace, on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz. The roofs
of their houses being flat, they made them their high places, and set up
altars upon them ([Jer 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#013.md); [Zep
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005).md), domestic altars. The kings of
Judah did so: and, though Josiah never used them, yet to this time they
remained there. Manasseh had built altars for his idols in the house of
the Lord. When he repented he removed them, and cast them out of the
city ([Ch2 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#015).md), but, not destroying
them, his son Amon, it seems, had brought them again into the courts of
the temple; there Josiah found them, and thence he broke them down, [Kg2
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#012.md). 5. There was Tophet, in the
valley of the son of Hinnom, very near Jerusalem, where the image of
Moloch (that god of unnatural cruelty, as others were of unnatural
uncleanness) was kept, to which some sacrificed their children, burning
them in the fire, others dedicated them, making them to pass through the
fire ([Kg2 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010).md), labouring in the
very fire, [Hab 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#013.md). It is supposed
to have been called Tophet from toph, a drum, because they beat drums at
the burning of the children, that their shrieks might not be heard. 6.
There were high places before Jerusalem, which Solomon had built, [Kg2
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#013.md). The altars and images on those
high places, we may suppose, had been taken away by some of the
preceding godly kings, or perhaps Solomon himself had removed them when
he became a penitent; but the buildings, or some parts of them,
remained, with other high places, till Josiah's time. Those that
introduce corruptions into religion know not how far they will reach nor
how long they will last. Antiquity is no certain proof of verity. There
were also high places all the kingdom over, from Geba to Beer-sheba
([Kg2 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#008).md), and high places of the
gates, in the entering in of the gate of the governor. In these high
places (bishop Patrick thinks) they burnt incense to those tutelar gods
to whom their idolatrous kings had committed the protection of their
city; and probably the governor of the city had a private altar for his
penates - his household-gods. 7. There were idolatrous priests, that
officiated at all those idolatrous altars ([Kg2
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005).md), chemarim, black men, or that
wore black. See [Zep 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#004.md). Those that
sacrificed to Osiris, or that wept for Tammuz ([Eze
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#014).md), or that worshipped the infernal
deities, put on black garments as mourners. These idolatrous priests the
kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places; they
were, it should seem, priests of the house of Aaron, who thus profaned
their dignity, and there were others also who had no right at all to the
priesthood, who burnt incense to Baal. 8. There were conjurers and
wizards, and such as dealt with familiar spirits, [Kg2
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#024.md). When they worshipped the devil
as their god no marvel that they consulted him as their oracle.

II\. What a full destruction good Josiah made of all those relics of
idolatry. Such is his zeal for the Lord of hosts, and his holy
indignation against all that is displeasing to him, that nothing shall
stand before him. The law was that the monuments of the Canaanites'
idolatry must be all destroyed ([Deu
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#005).md), much more those of the idolatry
of the Israelites, in whom it was much more impious, profane, and
perfidious. 1. He ordered Hilkiah, and the other priests, to clear the
temple. This was their province, [Kg2
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#004.md). Away with all the vessels that
were made for Baal. They must never be employed in the service of God,
no, nor reserved for any common use; they must all be burnt, and the
ashes of them carried to Bethel. That place had been the common source
of idolatry, for there was set up one of the calves, and, that lying
next to Judah, the infection had thence spread into that kingdom, and
therefore Josiah made it the lay-stall of idolatry, the dunghill to
which he carried the filth and offscouring of all things, that, if
possible, it might be made loathsome to those that had been fond of it.
2. The idolatrous priests were all put down. Those of them that were not
of the house of Aaron, or had sacrificed to Baal or other false gods, he
put to death, according to the law, [Kg2
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#020.md). He slew them upon their own
altars, the most acceptable sacrifice that ever had been offered upon
them, a sacrifice to the justice of God. Those that were descendants
from Aaron, and yet had burnt incense in the high places, but to the
true God only, he forbade ever to approach the altar of the Lord; they
had forfeited that honour ([Kg2 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#009).md):
He brought them out of the cities of Judah ([Kg2
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#008).md), that they might not do mischief
in the country by secretly keeping up their old idolatrous usages; but
he allowed them to eat of the unleavened bread (the bread of the
meat-offering, [Lev 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004.md), [Lev
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#005).md) among their brethren, with whom
they were to reside, that being under their eye they might be kept from
doing hurt and taught to do well; that bread, that unleavened bread
(heavy and unpleasant as it was), was better than they deserved, and
that would serve to keep them alive. But whether they were permitted to
eat of all the sacrifices, as blemished priests were ([Lev
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#022).md), which is called, in general,
the bread of their God, may be justly questioned. 3. All the images were
broken to pieces and burnt. The image of the grove ([Kg2
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#006).md), some goddess or other, was
reduced to ashes, and the ashes cast upon the graves of the common
people ([Kg2 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#006).md), the common
burying-place of the city. By the law a ceremonial uncleanness was
contracted by the touch of a grave, so that in casting them here he
declared them most impure, and none could touch them without thereby
making themselves unclean. He cast it into the graves (so the Chaldee),
intimating that he would have all idolatry buried out of his sight, as a
loathsome thing, and forgotten, as dead men are out of mind, [Kg2
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#014.md). He filled the places of the
groves with the bones of men; as he carried the ashes of the images to
the graves, to mingle them with dead men's bones, so he carried dead
men's bones to the places where the images had been, and put them in the
room of them, that, both ways, idolatry might be rendered loathsome, and
the people kept both from the dust of the images and from the ruins of
the places where they had been worshipped. Dead men and dead gods were
much alike and fittest to go together. 4. All the wicked houses were
suppressed, those nests of impiety that harboured idolaters, the houses
of the Sodomites, [Kg2 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#007.md). "Down
with them, down with them, rase them to the foundations." The high
places were in like manner broken down and levelled with the ground
([Kg2 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#008).md), even that which belonged
to the governor of the city; for no man's greatness or power may protect
him in idolatry or profaneness. Let governors be obliged, in the first
place, to reform, and then the governed will be the sooner influenced.
He defiled the high places ([Kg2 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#008.md)
and again [Kg2 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#013).md), did all he
could to render them abominable, and put the people out of conceit with
them, as Jehu did when he made the house of Baal a draught-house, [Kg2
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#027.md). Tophet, which, contrary to
other places of idolatry, was in a valley, whereas they were on hills or
high places, was likewise defiled ([Kg2
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010).md), was made the burying-place of
the city. Concerning this we have a whole sermon, [Jer
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001.md), [Jer
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#002.md), etc., where it is said, They
shall bury in Tophet, and the whole city is threatened to be made like
Tophet. 5. The horses that had been given to the sun were taken away and
put to common use, and so were delivered from the vanity to which they
were made subject; and the chariots of the sun (what a pity was it that
those horses and chariots should be kept as the chariots and horsemen of
Israel!) he burnt with fire; and, if the sun be a flame, they never
resembled him so much as they did when they were chariots of fire. 6.
The workers with familiar spirits and the wizards were put away, [Kg2
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#024.md). Those of them that were
convicted of witchcraft, it is likely, he put to death, and so deterred
others from those diabolical practices. In all this he had a sincere
regard to the words of the law which were written in the book lately
found, [Kg2 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#024.md). He made that law
his rule and kept that in his eye throughout this reformation.

III\. How his zeal extended itself to the cities of Israel that were
within his reach. The ten tribes were carried captive and the Assyrian
colonies did not fully people the country, so that, it is likely, many
cities had put themselves under the protection of the kings of Judah,
[Ch2 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#001.md); [Ch2
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#006.md). These he here visits, to carry
on his reformation. As far as our influence goes our endeavours should
go to do good and bring the wickedness of the wicked to an end.

1\. He defiled and demolished Jeroboam's altar at Bethel, with the high
place and the grove that belonged to it, [Kg2
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#015.md), [Kg2
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#016.md). The golden calf, it should
seem, was gone (thy calf, O Samaria! has cast thee off), but the altar
was there, which those that were wedded to their old idolatries made use
of still. This was, (1.) Defiled, [Kg2
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#016.md). Josiah, in his pious zeal, was
ransacking the old seats of idolatry, and spied the sepulchres in the
mount, in which probably the idolatrous priests were buried, not far
from the altar at which they had officiated, and which they were so fond
of that they were desirous to lay their bones by it; these he opened,
took out the bones, and burnt them upon the altar, to show that thus he
would have done by the priests themselves if they had been alive, as he
did by those whom he found alive, [Kg2
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#020.md). Thus he polluted the altar,
desecrated it, and made it odious. It is threatened against idolaters
([Jer 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#001.md), [Jer
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#002).md) that their bones shall be spread
before the sun; that which is there threatened and this which is here
executed (bespeaking their iniquity to be upon their bones, [Eze
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#027).md) are an intimation of a
punishment after death, reserved for those that live and die impenitent
in that or any other sin; the burning of the bones, if that were all, is
a small matter, but, if it signify the torment of the soul in a worse
flame ([Luk 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#024).md), it is very
dreadful. This, as it was Josiah's act, seems to have been the result of
a very sudden resolve; he would not have done it but that he happened to
turn himself, and spy the sepulchres; and yet it was foretold above 350
years before, when this altar was first built by Jeroboam, [Kg1
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#002.md). God always foresees, and has
sometimes foretold as certain, that which yet to us seems most
contingent. The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord; king Josiah's
was so, and he turned it (or ever he himself was aware, [Sol
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#012).md) to do this. No work of God shall
fall to the ground. (2.) It was demolished. He broke down the altar and
all its appurtenances ([Kg2 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#015).md),
burnt what was combustible, and, since an idol is nothing in the world,
he went as far towards the annihilating of it as he could; for he
stamped it small to powder and made it as dust before the wind.

2\. He destroyed all the houses of the high places, all those synagogues
of Satan that were in the cities of Samaria, [Kg2
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#019.md). These the kings of Israel
built, and God raised up this king of Judah to pull them down, for the
honour of the ancient house of David, from which the ten tribes had
revolted; the priests he justly made sacrifices upon their own altars,
[Kg2 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#020.md).

3\. He carefully preserved the sepulchre of that man of God who came
from Judah to foretel this, which now a king who came from Judah
executed. This was that good prophet who proclaimed these things against
the altar of Bethel, and yet was himself slain by a lion for disobeying
the word of the Lord; but to show that God's displeasure against him
went no further than his death, but ended there, God so ordered it that
when all the graves about his were disturbed his was safe ([Kg2
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#017.md), [Kg2
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#018).md) and no man moved his bones. He
had entered into peace, and therefore should rest in his bed, [Isa
57:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#002.md). The old lying prophet, who
desired to be buried as near him as might be, it should seem, knew what
he did; for his dust also, being mingled with that of the good prophet,
was preserved for his sake; see [Num
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#010.md).

IV\. We are here told what a solemn passover Josiah and his people kept
after all this. When they had cleared the country of the old leaven they
then applied themselves to the keeping of the feast. When Jehu had
destroyed the worship of Baal, yet he took no heed to walk in the
commandments and ordinances of God; but Josiah considered that we must
learn to do well, and no only cease to do evil, and that the way to keep
out all abominable customs is to keep up all instituted ordinances (see
[Lev 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#030).md), and therefore he
commanded all the people to keep the passover, which was not only a
memorial of their deliverance out of Egypt, but a token of their
dedication to him that brought them out and their communion with him.
This he found written in the book of the law, here called the book of
the covenant; for, though the divine authority may deal with us in a way
of absolute command, divine grace condescends to federal transactions,
and therefore he observed it. We have not such a particular account of
this passover as of that in Hezekiah's time, 2 Chr. 30. But, in general,
we are told that there was not holden such a passover in any of the
foregoing reigns, no, not from the days of the judges ([Kg2
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#022).md), which, by the way, intimates
that, though the account which the book of Judges gives of the state of
Israel under that dynasty looks but melancholy, yet there were then some
golden days. This passover, it seems, was extraordinary for the number
and devotion of the communicants, their sacrifices and offerings, and
their exact observance of the laws of the feast; and it was not now as
in Hezekiah's passover, when many communicated that were not cleansed
according to the purification of the sanctuary, and the Levites were
permitted to do the priests' work. We have reason to think that during
all the remainder of Josiah's reign religion flourished and the feasts
of the Lord were very carefully observed; but in this passover the
satisfaction they took in the covenant lately renewed, the reformation
in pursuance of it, and the revival of an ordinance of which they had
lately found the divine original in the book of the law, and which had
long been neglected or carelessly kept, put them into great transports
of holy joy; and God was pleased to recompense their zeal in destroying
idolatry with uncommon tokens of his presence and favour. All this
concurred to make it a distinguished passover.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 23:25</span></span>

Upon the reading of these verses we must say, Lord, though thy
righteousness be as the great mountains - evident, conspicuous, and past
dispute, yet thy judgments are a great deep, unfathomable and past
finding out, [Psa 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#006.md). What shall we
say to this?

I. It is here owned that Josiah was one of the best kings that ever sat
upon the throne of David, [Kg2 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#025.md).
As Hezekiah was a non-such for faith and dependence upon God in straits
([Kg2 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#005).md), so Josiah was a non-such
for sincerity and zeal in carrying on a work of reformation. For this
there was none like him, 1. That he turned to the Lord from whom his
fathers had revolted. It is true religion to turn to God as one we have
chosen and love. He did what he could to turn his kingdom also to the
Lord. 2. That he did this with his heart and soul; his affections and
aims were right in what he did. Those make nothing of their religion
that do not make heart-work of it. 3. That he did it with all his heart,
and all his soul, and all his might - with vigour, and courage, and
resolution: he could not otherwise have broken through the difficulties
he had to grapple with. What great things may we bring to pass in the
service of God if we be but lively and hearty in it! 4. That he did this
according to all the law of Moses, in an exact observance of that law
and with an actual regard to it. His zeal did not transport him into any
irregularities, but, in all he did, he walked by rule.

II\. Notwithstanding this he was cut off by a violent death in the midst
of his days, and his kingdom was ruined within a few years after.
Consequent upon such a reformation as this, one would have expected
nothing but the prosperity and glory both of king and kingdom; but,
quite contrary, we find both under a cloud. 1. Even the reformed kingdom
continues marked for ruin. For all this ([Kg2
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#026).md) the Lord turned not from the
fierceness of his great wrath. That is certainly true, which God spoke
by the prophet ([Jer 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#007.md), [Jer
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#008).md), that if a nation, doomed to
destruction, turn from the evil of sin, God will repent of the evil of
punishment; and therefore we must conclude that Josiah's people, though
they submitted to Josiah's power, did not heartily imbibe Josiah's
principles. They were turned by force, and did not voluntarily turn from
their evil way, but still continued their affection for their idols; and
therefore he that knows men's hearts would not recall the sentence,
which was, That Judah should be removed, as Israel had been, and
Jerusalem itself cast off, [Kg2 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#027.md).
Yet even this destruction was intended to be their effectual
reformation; so that we must say, not only that the criminals had filled
their measure and were ripe for ruin, but also that the disease had come
to a crisis, and was ready for a cure; and this shall be all the fruit,
even the taking away of sin. 2. As an evidence of this, even the
reforming king is cut off in the midst of his usefulness - in mercy to
him, that he might not see the evil which was coming upon his kingdom,
but in wrath to his people, for his death was an inlet to their
desolations. The king of Egypt waged war, it seems, with the king of
Assyria: so the king of Babylon is now called. Josiah's kingdom lay
between them. He therefore thought himself concerned to oppose the king
of Egypt, and check the growing, threatening, greatness of his power;
for though, at this time, he protested that he had no design against
Josiah, yet, if he should prevail to unite the river of Egypt and the
river Euphrates, the land of Judah would soon be overflowed between
them. Therefore Josiah went against him, and was killed in the first
engagement, [Kg2 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029.md), [Kg2
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#030). Here, (1..md) We cannot justify
Josiah's conduct. He had no clear call to engage in this war, nor do we
find that he asked counsel of God by urim or prophets concerning it.
What had he to do to appear and act as a friend and ally to the king of
Assyria? Should he help the ungodly and love those that hate the Lord?
If the kings of Egypt and Assyria quarrelled, he had reason to think God
would bring good out of it to him and his people, by making them
instrumental to weaken one another. Some understand the promise made to
him that he should come to his grave in peace in a sense in which it was
not performed because, by his miscarriage in this matter, he forfeited
the benefit of it. God has promised to keep us in all our ways; but, if
we go out of our way, we throw ourselves out of his protection. I
understand the promise so as that I believe it was fulfilled, for he
died in peace with God and his own conscience, and saw not, nor had any
immediate prospect of, the destruction of Judah and Jerusalem by the
Chaldeans; yet I understand the providence to be a rebuke to him for his
rashness. (2.) We must adore God's righteousness in taking away such a
jewel from an unthankful people that knew not how to value it. They
greatly lamented his death ([Ch2
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#025).md), urged to it by Jeremiah, who
told them the meaning of it, and what a threatening omen it was; but
they had not made a due improvement of the mercies they enjoyed by his
life, of which God taught them the worth by the want.

Jerusalem saw not a good day after Josiah was laid in his grave, but one
trouble came after another, till within twenty-two years it was quite
destroyed. Of the reign of two of his sons here is a short account; the
former we find here a prisoner and the latter a tributary to the king of
Egypt, and both so in the very beginning of their reign. This king of
Egypt having slain Josiah, though he had not had any design upon Judah,
yet, being provoked by the opposition which Josiah gave him, now, it
should seem, he bent all his force against his family and kingdom. If
Josiah's sons had trodden in his steps, they would have fared the better
for his piety; but, deviating from them, they fared the worse for his
rashness.

I. Jehoahaz, a younger son, was first made king by the people of the
land, probably because he was observed to be of a more active warlike
genius than his elder brother, and likely to make head against the king
of Egypt and to avenge his father's death, which perhaps the people were
more solicitous about, in point of honour, than the keeping up and
carrying on of his father's reformation; and the issue was accordingly.
1. He did ill, [Kg2 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#032.md). Though he
had a good education and a good example given him, and many a good
prayer, we may suppose, put up for him, yet he did that which was evil
in the sight of the Lord, and, it is to be feared, began to do so in his
father's lifetime, for his reign was so short that he could not, in
that, show much of his character. He did according to all that his
wicked fathers had done. Though he had not time to do much, yet he had
chosen his patterns, and showed whom he intended to follow and whose
steps he resolved to tread in; and, having done this, he is here
reckoned to have done according to all the evil which those did whom he
proposed to imitate. It is of great consequence to young people whom
they choose to take for their patterns and whom they emulate. An error
in this choice is fatal. [Phi 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#017.md),
[Phi 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#018.md). 2. Doing ill, no wonder
that he fared ill. He was but three months a prince, and was then made a
prisoner, and lived and died so. The king of Egypt seized him, and put
him in bands ([Kg2 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#033).md), fearing
lest he should give him disturbance, and carried him to Egypt, where he
died soon after, [Kg2 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#034.md). This
Jehoahaz is that young lion whom Ezekiel speaks of in his lamentation
for the princes of Israel, that learnt to catch the prey and devour men
(that was the evil which he did in the sight of the Lord); but the
nations heard of him, he was taken in their pit, and they brought him
with chains into the land of Egypt, [Eze
19:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#001.md). See [Jer
22:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#010.md).

II\. Eliakim, another son of Josiah, was made king by the king of Egypt,
it is not said in the room of Jehoahaz (his reign was so short that it
was scarcely worth taking notice of), but in the room of Josiah. The
crown of Judah had hitherto always descended from a father to a son, and
never, till now, from one brother to another; once the succession had so
happened in the house of Ahab, but never, till now, in the house of
David. The king of Egypt, having used his power in making him king,
further showed it in changing his name; he called him Jehoiakim, a name
that has reference to Jehovah, for he had no design to make him renounce
or forget the religion of his country. "All people will walk in the name
of their God, and let him do so." The king of Babylon did not do so by
those whose names he changed, [Dan
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#007.md). Of this Jehoiakim we are here
told, 1. That the king of Egypt made him poor, exacted from him a vast
tribute of 100 talents of silver and a talent of gold ([Kg2
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#033).md), which, with much difficulty,
he squeezed out of his subjects and gave to Pharaoh, [Kg2
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#035.md). Formerly the Israelites had
spoiled the Egyptians; now the Egyptians spoil Israel. See what woeful
changes sin makes. 2. That which made him poor, yet did not make him
good. Notwithstanding the rebukes of Providence he was under, by which
he should have been convinced, humbled, and reformed, he did that which
was evil in the sight of the Lord ([Kg2
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#037).md), and so prepared against
himself greater judgments; for such God will send if less do not do the
work for which they are sent.
