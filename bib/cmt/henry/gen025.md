[Genesis 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 25:1</span></span>

Abraham lived, after the marriage of Isaac, thirty-five years, and all
that is recorded concerning him during the time lies here in a very few
verses. We hear no more of God's extraordinary appearances to him or
trials of him; for all the days, even of the best and greatest saints,
are not eminent days, some slide on silently, and neither come nor go
with observation; such were these last days of Abraham. We have here,

I. An account of his children by Keturah, another wife whom he married
after the death of Sarah. He had buried Sarah and married Isaac, the two
dear companions of his life, and was now solitary. He wanted a nurse,
his family wanted a governess, and it was not good for him to be thus
alone. He therefore marries Keturah, probably the chief of his
maid-servants, born in his house or bought with money. Marriage is not
forbidden to old age. By her he had six sons, in whom the promise made
to Abraham concerning the great increase of his posterity was in part
fulfilled, which, it is likely, he had an eye to this marriage. The
strength he received by the promise still remained in him, to show how
much the virtue of the promise exceeds the power of nature.

II\. The disposition which Abraham made of his estate, [Gen
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#005.md), [Gen
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#006.md). After the birth of these sons,
he set his house in order, with prudence and justice. 1. He made Isaac
his heir, as he was bound to do, in justice to Sarah his first and
principal wife, and to Rebekah who married Isaac upon the assurance of
it, [Gen 24:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#036.md). In this all, which he
settled upon Isaac, are perhaps included the promise of the land of
Canaan, and the entail of the covenant. Or, God having already made him
the heir of the promise, Abraham therefore made him heir of his estate.
Our affection and gifts should attend God's. 2. He gave portions to the
rest of his children, both to Ishmael, though at first he was sent empty
away, and to his sons by Keturah. It was justice to provide for them;
parents that do not imitate him in this are worse than infidels. It was
prudence to settle them in places distant from Isaac, that they might
not pretend to divide the inheritance with him, nor be in any way a care
or expense to him. Observe, He did this while he yet lived, lest it
should not be done, or not so well done, afterwards. Note, In many cases
it is wisdom for men to make their own hands their executors, and what
they find to do to do it while they live, as far as they can. These sons
of the concubines were sent into the country that lay east from Canaan,
and their posterity were called the children of the east, famous for
their numbers, [Jdg 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#005.md), [Jdg
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#033.md). Their great increase was the
fruit of the promise made to Abraham, that God would multiply his seed.
God, in dispensing his blessings, does as Abraham did; common blessings
he gives to the children of this world, as to the sons of the
bond-woman, but covenant-blessings he reserves for the heirs of promise.
All that he has is theirs, for they are his Isaacs, from whom the rest
shall be for ever separated.

III\. The age and death of Abraham, [Gen
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#007.md), [Gen
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#008.md). He lived 175 years, just 100
years after he came to Canaan; so long he was a sojourner in a strange
country. Though he lived long and lived well, though he did good and
could ill be spared, yet he died at last. Observe how his death is here
described. 1. He gave up the ghost. Hes life was not extorted from him,
but he cheerfully resigned it; into the hands of the Father of spirits
he committed his spirit. 2. He died in a good old age, an old man; so
God had promised him. His death was his discharge from the burdens of
his age: an old man would not so live always. It was also the crown of
the glory of his old age. 3. He was full of years, or full of life (as
it might be supplied), including all the conveniences and comforts of
life. He did not live till the world was weary of him, but till he was
weary of the world; he had had enough of it, and desired no more. Vixi
quantum satis est - I have lived long enough. A good man, though he
should not die old, dies full of days, satisfied with living here, and
longing to live in a better place. 4. He was gathered to his people. His
body was gathered to the congregation of the dead, and his soul to the
congregation of the blessed. Note, Death gathers us to our people. Those
that are our people while we live, whether the people of God or the
children of this world, are the people to whom death will gather us.

IV\. His burial, [Gen 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#009.md), [Gen
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#010.md). Here is nothing recorded of the
pomp or ceremony of his funeral; only we are told, 1. Who buried him:
His sons Isaac and Ishmael. It was the last office of respect they had
to pay to their good father. Some distance there had formerly been
between Isaac and Ishmael; but it seems either that Abraham had himself
brought them together while he lived, or at least that his death
reconciled them. 2. Where they buried him: in his own burying-place,
which he had purchased, and in which he had buried Sarah. Note, Those
that in life have been very dear to each other may not only innocently,
but laudably, desire to be buried together, that in their deaths they
may not be divided, and in token of their hopes of rising together.

[Genesis 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 25:11</span></span>

Immediately after the account of Abraham's death, Moses begins the story
of Isaac ([Gen 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#011).md), and tells us
where he dwelt and how remarkably God blessed him. Note, The blessing of
Abraham did not die with him, but survived to all the children of the
promise. But he presently digresses from the story of Isaac, to give a
short account of Ishmael, forasmuch as he also was a son of Abraham, and
God had made some promises concerning him, which it was requisite we
should know the accomplishment of. Observe here what is said, 1.
Concerning his children. He had twelve sons, twelve princes they are
called ([Gen 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#016).md), heads of
families, which in process of time became nations, distinct tribes,
numerous and very considerable. They peopled a very large continent,
that lay between Egypt and Assyria, called Arabia. The names of his
twelve sons are recorded. Midian and Kedar we often read of in
scripture. And some very good expositors have taken notice of the
signification of those three names which are put together ([Gen
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#014).md), as containing good advice to
us all, Mishma, Dumah, and Massa, that is, hear, keep silence, and bear;
we have them together in the same order, [Jam
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#019.md), Be swift to hear, slow to speak,
slow to wrath. The posterity of Ishmael had not only tents in the
fields, wherein they grew rich in times of peace; but they had towns and
castles ([Gen 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#016).md), wherein they
fortified themselves in time of war. Now the number and strength of this
family were the fruit of the promise made to Hagar concerning Ishmael
([Gen 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#010).md), and to Abraham, [Gen
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#020.md) and [Gen
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#013.md). Note, Many that are strangers
to the covenants of promise are yet blessed with outward prosperity for
the sake of their godly ancestors. Wealth and riches shall be in their
house. 2. Concerning himself. Here is an account of his age: He lived
137 years ([Gen 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#017).md) which is
recorded to show the efficacy of Abraham's prayer for him ([Gen
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#018).md), O that Ishmael might live
before thee! Here is also an account of his death; he too was gathered
to his people; but it is not said that he was full of days, though he
lived to so great an age: he was not so weary of the world, nor so
willing to leave it, as his good father was. Those words, he fell in the
presence of all his brethren, whether they mean, as we take them, he
died, or, as others, his lot fell, are designed to show the fulfilling
of that word to Hagar ([Gen 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#012).md), He
shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren, that is, he shall
flourish and be eminent among them, and shall hold his own to the last.
Or he died with his friends about him, which is comfortable.

[Genesis 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 25:19</span></span>

We have here an account of the birth of Jacob and Esau, the twin sons of
Isaac and Rebekah: their entrance into the world was (which is not
usual) one of the most considerable parts of their story; nor is much
related concerning Isaac but what had reference to his father while he
lived and to his sons afterwards. For Isaac seems not to have been a man
of action, nor much tried, but to have spent his days in quietness and
silence. Now concerning Jacob and Esau we are here told,

I. That they were prayed for. Their parents, after they had been long
childless, obtained them by prayer, [Gen
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#020.md), [Gen
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#021.md). Isaac was forty years old when
he was married; though he was an only son, and the person from whom the
promised seed was to come, yet he made no haste to marry. He was sixty
years old when his sons were born ([Gen
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#026).md), so that, after he was married,
he had no child for twenty years. Note, Though the accomplishment of
God's promise is always sure, yet it is often slow, and seems to be
crossed and contradicted by Providence, that the faith of believers may
be tried, their patience exercised, and mercies long waited for may be
the more welcome when they come. While this mercy was delayed, Isaac did
not approach to a handmaid's bed, as Abraham had done, and Jacob
afterwards; for he loved Rebekah, [Gen
24:67](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#067.md). But, 1. He prayed: he entreated
the Lord for his wife. Though God had promised to multiply his family,
he prayed for its increase; for God's promises must not supersede, but
encourage, our prayers, and be improved as the ground of our faith.
Though he had prayed for this mercy very often, and had continued his
supplication many years, and it was not granted, yet he did not leave
off praying for it; for men ought always to pray, and not to faint ([Luk
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#001).md), to pray without ceasing, and
knock till the door be opened, He prayed for his wife; some read it with
his wife. Note, Husbands and wives should pray together, which is
intimated in the apostle's caution, that their prayers be not hindered,
[Pe1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007.md). The Jews have a tradition
that Isaac, at length, took his wife with him to mount Moriah, where God
had promised that he would multiply Abraham's seed (ch. 22:17), and
there, in his prayer with her and for her, pleaded the promise made in
that very place. 2. God heard his prayer, and was entreated of him.
Note, Children are the gift of God. Those that continue instant in
prayer, as Isaac did, shall find, at last, that they did not seek in
vain, [Isa 45:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#019.md).

II\. That they were prophesied of before they were born, and great
mysteries were wrapped up in the prophecies which went before of them,
[Gen 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#022.md), [Gen
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023.md). Long had Isaac prayed for a
son; and now his wife is with child of two, to recompense him for his
long waiting. Thus God often outdoes our prayers, and gives more than we
are able to ask or think. Now Rebekah being with child of these two
sons, observe here,

1\. How she was perplexed in her mind concerning her present case: The
children struggled together within her. The commotion she felt was
altogether extraordinary and made her very uneasy. Whether she was
apprehensive that the birth would be her death, or whether she was weary
of the intestine tumult, or whether she suspected it to be an ill omen,
it seems she was ready to wish that either she had not been with child
or that she might die immediately, and not bring forth such a struggling
brood: If it be so, or, since it is so, Why am I thus? Before, the want
of children was her trouble, now, the struggle of the children is no
loss so. Note, (1.) The comforts we are most desirous of are sometimes
found to bring along with them more occasion of trouble and uneasiness
that we thought of; vanity being written upon all things under the sun,
God thus teaches us to read it. (2.) We are too apt to be discontented
with our comforts, because of the uneasiness that attends them. We know
not when we are pleased; we know neither how to want nor how to abound.
This struggle between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of Satan,
\[1.\] In the world. The seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent
have been contending ever since the enmity was put between them ([Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015).md), and this has occasioned a
constant uneasiness among men. Christ himself came to send fire on
earth, and this division, [Luk 12:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#049.md),
[Luk 12:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#051.md). But let not this be
offence to us. A holy war is better than the peace of the devil's
palace. \[2.\] In the hearts of believers. No sooner is Christ formed in
the soul than immediately there begins a conflict between the flesh and
spirit, [Gal 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#017.md). The stream is not
turned without a mighty struggle, which yet ought not to discourage us.
It is better to have a conflict with sin than tamely to submit to it.

2\. What course she took for her relief: She went to enquire of the
Lord. Some think Melchizedek was now consulted as an oracle, or perhaps
some Urim or Teraphim were now used to enquire of God by, as afterwards
in the breast-plate of judgment. Note, The word and prayer, by both
which we now enquire of the Lord, give great relief to those that are
upon any account perplexed. It is a great relief to the mind to spread
our case before the Lord, and ask counsel at his mouth. Go into the
sanctuary, [Psa 73:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#017.md).

3\. The information given her, upon her enquiry, which expounded the
mystery: Two nations are in thy womb, [Gen
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023.md). She was now pregnant, not only
with two children, but two nations, which should not only in their
manners and dispositions greatly differ from each other, but in their
interests clash and contend with each other; and the issue of the
contest should be that the elder should serve the younger, which was
fulfilled in the subjection of the Edomites, for many ages, to the house
of David, till they revolted, [Ch2
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#008). Observe here, (1..md) God is a free
agent in dispensing his grace; it is his prerogative to make a
difference between those who have not as yet themselves done either good
or evil. This the apostle infers hence, [Rom
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#012) (2..md) In the struggle between
grace and corruption in the soul, grace, the younger, shall certainly
get the upper hand at last.

III\. That when they were born there was a great difference between
them, which served to confirm what had been foretold ([Gen
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023).md), was presage of the
accomplishment of it, and served greatly to illustrate the type.

1\. There was a great difference in their bodies, [Gen
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#025.md). Esau, when he was born, was
rough and hairy, as if he had been already a grown man, whence he had
his name Esau, made, reared already. This was an indication of a very
strong constitution, and gave cause to expect that he would be a very
robust, daring, active man. But Jacob was smooth and tender as other
children. Note, (1.) The difference of men's capacities, and
consequently of their condition in the world, arises very much from the
difference of their natural constitution; some are plainly designed by
nature for activity and honour, others as manifestly marked for
obscurity. This instance of the divine sovereignty in the kingdom of
providence may perhaps help to reconcile us to the doctrine of the
divine sovereignty in the kingdom of grace. (2.) It is God's usual way
to choose the weak things of the world, and to pass by the mighty, [Co1
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026.md), [Co1
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#027.md).

2\. There was a manifest contest in their births. Esau, the stronger,
came forth first; but Jacob's hand took hold of his heel, [Gen
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#026). This signified, (1..md) Jacob's
pursuit of the birthright and blessing; from the first, he reached forth
to catch hold of it, and, if possible, to prevent his brother. (2.) His
prevailing for it at last, that, in precess of time, he should undermine
his brother, and gain his point. This passage is referred to ([Hos
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#008).md), and hence he had his name,
Jacob, a supplanter.

3\. They were very unlike in the temper of their minds, and the way of
living they chose, [Gen 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#027.md). They
soon appeared to be of very different dispositions. (1.) Esau was a man
for this world. He was a man addicted to his sports, for he was a
hunter; and a man who knew how to live by his wits, for he was a cunning
hunter. Recreation was his business; he studied the art of it, and spent
all his time in it. He never loved a book, nor cared for being within
doors; but he was a man of the field, like Nimrod and Ishmael, all for
the game, and never well but when he was upon the stretch in pursuit of
it: in short, he set up for a gentleman and a soldier. (2.) Jacob was a
man for the other world. He was not cut out for a statesman, nor did he
affect to look great, but he was a plain man, dwelling in tents, an
honest man that always meant well, and dealt fairly, that preferred the
true delights of solitude and retirement to all the pretended pleasure
of busy noisy sports: he dwelt in tents, \[1.\] As a shepherd. he was
attached to that safe and silent employment of keeping sheep, to which
also he bred up his children, [Gen
46:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#034.md). Or, \[2.\] As a student. He
frequented the tents of Melchizedek, or Heber, as some understand it, to
be taught by them divine things. And this was that son of Isaac on whom
the covenant was entailed.

4\. Their interest in the affections of their parents was likewise
different. They had but these two children, and, it seems, one was the
father's darling and the other the mother's, [Gen
25:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#028). (1..md) Isaac, though he was not a
stirring man himself (for when he went into the fields he went to
meditate and pray, not to hunt), yet loved to have his son active. Esau
knew how to please him, and showed a great respect for him, by treating
him often with venison, which gained him the affections of the good old
man, and won upon him more than one would have thought. (2.) Rebekah was
mindful of the oracle of God, which had given the preference to Jacob,
and therefore she preferred him in her love. And, if it be lawful for
parents to make a difference between their children upon any account,
doubtless Rebekah was in the right, that loved him whom God loved.

[Genesis 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 25:29</span></span>

We have here a bargain made between Jacob and Esau about the birthright,
which was Esau's by providence but Jacob's by promise. It was a
spiritual privilege, including the excellency of dignity and the
excellency of power, as well as the double portion, [Gen
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#003.md). It seemed to be such a
birthright as had then the blessing annexed to it, and the entail of the
promise. Now see,

I. Jacob's pious desire of the birthright, which yet he sought to obtain
by indirect courses, not agreeable to his character as a plain man. It
was not out of pride or ambition that he coveted the birthright, but
with an eye to spiritual blessings, which he had got well acquainted
with in his tents, while Esau had lost the scent of them in the field.
For this he is to be commended, that he coveted earnestly the best
gifts; yet in this he cannot be justified, that he took advantage of his
brother's necessity to make him a very hard bargain ([Gen
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#031).md): Sell me this day thy
birthright. Probably there had formerly been some communication between
them about this matter, and then it was not so great a surprise upon
Esau as here it seems to be; and, it may be, Esau had sometimes spoken
slightly of the birthright and its appurtenances, which encouraged Jacob
to make this proposal to him. And, if so, Jacob is, in some measure,
excusable in what he did to gain his point. Note, Plain men that have
their conversation in simplicity and godly sincerity, and without
worldly wisdom, are often found wisest of all for their souls and
eternity. Those are wise indeed that are wise for another world. Jacob's
wisdom appeared in two things: - 1. He chose the fittest time, took the
opportunity when it offered itself, and did not let it slip. 2. Having
made the bargain, he made it sure, and got it confirmed by Esau's oath:
Swear to me this day, [Gen 25:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#033.md). He
took Esau when he was in the mind, and would not leave him a power of
revocation. In a case of this nature, it is good to be sure.

II\. Esau's profane contempt of the birthright, and the foolish sale he
made of it. He is called profane Esau for it ([Heb
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016).md), because for one morsel of meat
he sold his birthright, as dear a morsel as ever was eaten since the
forbidden fruit; and he lived to regret it when it was too late. Never
was there such a foolish bargain as this which Esau now made; and yet he
valued himself upon his policy, and had the reputation of a cunning man,
and perhaps had often bantered his brother Jacob as a weak and simple
man. Note, There are those that are penny-wise and pound-foolish,
cunning hunters that can out-wit others and draw them into their snares,
and yet are themselves imposed upon by Satan's wiles and led captive by
him at his will. Again, God often chooses the foolish things of the
world, by them to confound the wise. Plain Jacob makes a fool of cunning
Esau. Observe the instances of Esau's folly.

1\. His appetite was very strong, [Gen
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#029.md), [Gen
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#030.md). Poor Jacob had got some bread
and pottage ([Gen 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#029).md) for his
dinner, and was sitting down to it contentedly enough, without venison,
when Esau came from hunting, hungry and weary, and perhaps had caught
nothing. And now Jacob's pottage pleased his eye better than ever his
game had done. Give me (says he) some of that red, that red, as it is in
the original; it suited his own colour ([Gen
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#025).md), and, in reproach to him for
this, he was ever afterwards called Edom, red. Nay, it should seem, he
was so faint that he could not feed himself, nor had he a servant at
hand to help him, but entreats his brother to feed him. Note, (1.) Those
that addict themselves to sport weary themselves for very vanity, [Hab
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#013.md). They might do the most needful
business, and gain the greatest advantages, with half the pains they
take, and half the perils they run into, in pursuit of their foolish
pleasures. (2.) Those that work with quietness are more constantly and
comfortably provided for than those that hunt with noise: bread is not
always to the wise, but those that trust in the Lord and do good verily
they shall be fed, fed with daily bread; not as Esau, sometimes feasting
and sometimes fainting. (3.) The gratifying of the sensual appetite is
that which ruins thousands of precious souls: surely, if Esau was hungry
and faint, he might have got a meal's meat cheaper than at the expense
of his birthright; but he was unaccountably fond of the colour of this
pottage, and could not deny himself the satisfaction of a mess of it,
whatever it cost him. Never better can come of it, when men's hearts
walk after their eyes ([Job 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#007).md), and
when they serve their own bellies: therefore look not thou upon the
wine, or, as Esau, upon the pottage, when it is red, when it gives that
colour in the cup, in the dish, which is most inviting, [Pro
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#031.md). If we use ourselves to deny
ourselves, we break the forces of most temptations.

2\. His reasoning was very weak ([Gen
25:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#032).md): Behold, I am at the point to
die; and, if he were, would nothing serve to keep him alive but this
pottage? If the famine were now in the land ([Gen
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#001).md), as Dr. Lightfoot conjectures,
we cannot suppose Isaac so poor, or Rebekah so bad a house-keeper, but
that he might have been supplied with food convenient, other ways, and
might have saved his birthright: but his appetite has the mastery of
him; he is in a longing condition, nothing will please him but this red
this red pottage, and, to palliate his desire, he pretends he is at the
point to die. If it had been so, was it not better for him to die in
honour than to live in disgrace, to die under a blessing than to live
under a curse? The birthright was typical of spiritual privileges, those
of the church of the first-born. Esau was now tried how he would value
them, and he shows himself sensible only of present grievances; may he
but get relief against them, he cares not for his birthright. Better
principled was Naboth, who would lose his life rather than sell his
vineyard, because his part in the earthly Canaan signified is part in
the heavenly, [Kg1 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#003). (1..md) If we
look on Esau's birthright as only a temporal advantage, what he said had
something of truth in it, namely, that our worldly enjoyments, even
those we are most fond of, will stand us in no stead in a dying hour
([Psa 49:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#006).md); they will not put by
the stroke of death, nor ease the pangs nor remove the sting: yet Esau,
who set up for a gentleman, should have had a greater and more noble
spirit than to sell even such an honour so cheaply. (2.) But, being of a
spiritual nature, his undervaluing it was the greatest profaneness
imaginable. Note, It is egregious folly to part with our interest in
God, and Christ, and heaven, for the riches, honours, and pleasures, of
this world, as bad a bargain as his that sold a birthright for a dish of
broth.

3\. Repentance was hidden from his eyes ([Gen
25:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#034).md): He did eat and drink, pleased
his palate, satisfied his cravings, congratulated himself on the good
meal's meat he had had, and then carelessly rose up and went his way,
without any serious reflections upon the bad bargain he had made, or any
show of regret. Thus Esau despised his birthright; he used no means at
all to get the bargain revoked, made no appeal to his father about it,
nor proposed to his brother to compound the matter; but the bargain
which his necessity had made (supposing it were so) his profaneness
confirmed ex post facto - after the deed; and by his subsequent neglect
and contempt he did, as it were, acknowledge a fine, and by justifying
himself in what he had done he put the bargain past recall. Note, People
are ruined, not so much by doing what is amiss, as by doing it and not
repenting of it, doing it and standing to it.
