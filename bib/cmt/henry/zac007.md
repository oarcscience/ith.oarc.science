### [Zechariah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001.md)

[Zechariah](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">zac 7:0</span></span>

We have done with the visions, but not with the revelations of this
book; the prophet sees no more such signs as he had seen, but still "the
word of the Lord came to him." In this chapter we have, I. A case of
conscience proposed to the prophet by the children of the captivity
concerning fasting, whether they should continue their solemn fasts
which they had religiously observed during the seventy years of their
captivity ([Zac 7:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001).md). II. The answer
to this question, which is given in this and the next chapter; and this
answer was given not all at once, but by piece-meal, and, it should
seem, at several times, for here are four distinct discourses which have
all of them reference to this case, each of them prefaced with "the word
of the Lord came," ([Zac 7:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#004.md) and
[Zac 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#001.md), [Zac
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#018).md). The method of them is very
observable. In this chapter, 1. The prophet sharply reproves them for
the mismanagements of their fasts ([Zac
7:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#004).md). 2. He exhorts them to reform
their lives, which would be the best way of fasting, and to take heed of
those sins which brought those judgments upon them which they kept these
fasts in memory of ([Zac 7:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#008).md). And
then in the next chapter, having searched the wound, he binds it up, and
heals it, with gracious assurances of great mercy God had yet in store
for them, by which he would turn their fasts into feasts.

[Zechariah 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 7:1</span></span>

This occasional sermon, which the prophet preached, and which is
recorded in this and the next chapter, was above two years after the
former, in which he gave them an account of his visions, as appears by
comparing the date of this ([Zac 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001).md),
in the ninth month of the fourth year of Darius, with the date of that
([Zac 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001).md), in the eighth month of the
second year of Darius; not that Zechariah was idle all that while (it is
expressly said that he and Haggai continued prophesying till the temple
was finished in the sixth year of Darius; [Ezr
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#014.md), [Ezr
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#015).md), but during that time he did not
preach any sermon that was afterwards published, and left upon record,
as this is. God may be honoured, his work done, and his interest served,
by word of mouth as well as by writing; and by inculcating and pressing
what has been taught, as well as by advancing something new. Now here we
have,

I. A case proposed concerning fasting. Some persons were sent to enquire
of the priests and prophets whether they should continue to observe
their yearly fasts, particularly that in the fifth month, as they had
done. It is uncertain whether the case was put by those that yet
remained in Babylon, who, being deprived of the benefit of the solemn
feasts which God's ordinance appointed them, made up the want by the
solemn fasts which God's providences called them to; or by those that
had returned, but lived in the country, as some rather incline to think,
because they are called the people of the land, [Zac
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#005.md). But, as to that, the answer given
to the messengers of the captive Jews might be directed, not to them
only, but to all the people. Observe,

1\. Who they were that came with this enquiry - Sherezer and
Regem-melech, persons of some rank and figure, for they came with their
men, and did not think it below them, or any disparagement to them, to
be sent on this errand, but rather an addition to their honour to be,
(1.) Attendants in God's house, there to do duty and receive orders. The
greatest of men are less than the least of the ordinances of Jesus
Christ. (2.) Agents for God's people, to negotiate their affairs. Men of
estates, having more leisure than men of business, ought to employ their
time in the service of the public, and by doing good they make
themselves truly great; the messengers of the churches were the glory of
Christ, [Co2 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#023.md).

2\. What the errand was upon which they came. They were sent perhaps not
with gold and silver (as those, [Zac
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#010.md), [Zac
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#011).md), or, if they were, that is not
mentioned, but upon the two great errands which should bring us all to
the house of God, (1.) to intercede with God for his mercy. They were
sent to pray before the Lord, and, some think (according to the usage
then), to offer sacrifice, with which they offered up their prayers. The
Jews, in captivity, prayed towards the temple (as appears [Dan
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#010).md); but now that it was in a fair
way to be rebuilt they sent their representatives to pray in it,
remembering that God had said that his house should be called a house of
prayer for all people, [Isa 56:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#007.md). In
prayer we must set ourselves as before the Lord, must see his eye upon
us and have our eye up to him. (2.) To enquire of God concerning his
mind. Note, When we offer up our requests to God it must be with a
readiness to receive instructions from him; for, if we turn away our ear
from hearing his law, we cannot expect that our prayers should be
acceptable to him. We must therefore desire to dwell in the house of the
Lord all the days of our life that we may enquire there ([Psa
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004).md), asking, not only, Lord, what
wilt thou do for me? but, Lord what wilt thou have me to do?

3\. Whom they consulted. They spoke to the priests that were in the
house of the Lord and to the prophets; the former were an oracle for
ordinary cases, the latter for extraordinary; they were blessed with
both, and would try if either could acquaint them with the mind of God
in this case. Note, God having given diversities of gifts to men, and
all to profit with, we should make use of all as there is occasion. They
were not so wedded to the priests, their stated ministers, as to
distrust the prophets, who appeared, by the gifts given them, well
qualified to serve the church; nor yet were they so much enamoured with
the prophets as to despise the priests, but they spoke both to the
priests and to the prophets, and, in consulting both, gave glory to the
God of Israel, and that one Spirit who works all in all. God might speak
to them either by urim or by prophets ([Sa1
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#006).md), and therefore they would not
neglect either. The priests and the prophets were not jealous one of
another, nor had any difference among themselves; let not the people
then make differences between them, but thank God they had both. The
prophets did indeed reprove what was amiss in the priests, but at the
same time told the people that the priest's lips should keep knowledge,
and they must enquire the law at his mouth, for he is the messenger of
the Lord of hosts, [Mal 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007.md). Note,
Those that would know God's mind should consult God's ministers, and in
doubtful cases ask advice of those whose special business it is to
search the scriptures.

4\. What the case was which they desired satisfaction in ([Zac
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#003).md): Should I weep in the fifth
month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years. Observe,
(1.) What had been their past practice, not only during the seventy
years of the captivity but to this time, which was twenty years after
the liberty proclaimed them; they kept up solemn stated fasts for
humiliation and prayer, which they religiously observed, according as
their opportunities were, in their closets, families, or such assemblies
for worship as they had. In the case here, they mention only one, that
of the fifth month; but it appears, by [Zac
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#019.md), that they observed four
anniversary fasts, one in the fourth month (June 17), in remembrance of
the breaking up of the wall of Jerusalem ([Jer
52:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#006).md), another in the fifth month
(July 4), in remembrance of the burning of the temple ([Jer
52:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012.md), [Jer
52:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#013).md), another in the seventh month
(September 3), in remembrance of the killing of Gedaliah, which
completed their dispersion, and another in the tenth month (December
10), in remembrance of the beginning of the siege of Jerusalem, [Kg2
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001.md). Now it was very commendable in
them to keep those fasts, thus to humble themselves under those humbling
providences, by which God called them to weeping and mourning, thus to
accommodate themselves to their troubles, and prepare themselves for
deliverance. It would likewise be a means of possessing their children
betimes with a due sense of the hand of the Lord gone out against them.
(2.) What was their present doubt - whether they should continue these
fasts or no. The case is put as by a single person: Should I weep? But
it was the case of many, and the satisfaction of one would be a
satisfaction to the rest. Or perhaps many had left it off, but the
querist will not be determined by the practice of others; if God will
have him continue it, he will, whatever others do. His fasting is
described by his weeping, separating himself. A religious fast must be
solemnized, not only by abstinence, here called a separating ourselves
from the ordinary lawful comforts of life, but by a godly sorrow for
sin, here expressed by weeping. "Should I still keep such days to
afflict the soul as I have done these so many years?" It is said ([Zac
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#005).md) to be seventy years, computed
from the last captivity, as before, [Zac
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#012.md). The enquiry intimates a
readiness to continue it, if God so appoint, though it be a
mortification to the flesh. \[1.\] Something is to be said for the
continuance of these fasts. Fasting and praying are good work at any
time, and do good; we have always both cause enough and need enough to
humble ourselves before God. To throw off these fasts would be an
evidence of their being too secure, and a cause of their being more so.
They were still in distress, and under the tokens of God's displeasure;
and it is unwise for the patient to break off his course of physic while
he is sensible of such remains of his distemper. But, \[2.\] There is
something to be said for the letting fall of these fasts. God had
changed the method of his providences concerning them, and returned in
ways of mercy to them; and ought not they then to change the method of
their duties? Now that the bridegroom has returned, why should the
children of the bride-chamber fast? Every thing is beautiful in its
season. And as to the fast of the fifth month (which is that they
particularly enquire about), that, being kept in remembrance of the
burning of the temple, might seem to be superseded rather than any of
the other, because the temple was now in a fair way to be rebuilt. But,
having long kept up this fast, they would not leave it off without
advice, and without asking and knowing God's mind in the case. Note, A
good method of religious services, which we have found beneficial to
ourselves and others, ought not to be altered without good reason, and
therefore not without mature deliberation.

II\. An answer given to this case. It should seem that, though the
question looked plausible enough, those who proposed it were not
conscientious in it, for they were more concerned about the ceremony
than about the substance; they seemed to boast of their fasting, and to
upbraid God Almighty with it, that he had not sooner returned in mercy
to them; "for we have done it these so many years." As those, [Isa
58:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#003.md), Wherefore have we fasted, and
thou seest not? And some think that unbelief, and distrust of the
promises of God, were at the bottom of their enquiry; for, if they had
given them the credit that was due to them, they needed not to doubt but
that their fasts ought to be laid aside, now that the occasion of them
was over. And therefore the first answer to their enquiry is a very
sharp reproof of their hypocrisy, directed, not only to the people of
the land, but to the priests, who had set up these fasts, and perhaps
some of them were for keeping them up, to serve some purpose of their
own. Let them all take notice that, whereas they thought they had made
God very much their debtor by these fasts, they were much mistaken, for
they were not acceptable to him, unless they had been observed in a
better manner and to better purpose.

1\. What they did that was good was not done aright ([Zac
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#005).md): You fasted and mourned. They
were not chargeable with the omission or neglect of the duty, though it
was displeasing to the body (thy fasts were continually before me, [Psa
50:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008).md), but they had not managed them
aright. Note, Those that come to enquire of their duty must be willing
first to be told of their faults. And those that seem zealous for the
outside of a duty ought to examine themselves faithfully whether they
have the regard they ought to have to the inside of it. (1.) They had
not an eye to God in their fasting: Did you at all fast unto me, even to
me? He appeals to their own consciences; they will witness against them
that they had not been sincere in it, much more will God, who is greater
than the heart and knows all things. You know very well that you did not
at all fast to me; in fasting did you fast to me? There was the carcase
and form of the duty, but none of the life, and soul, and power of it.
Was it to me, even to me? The repetition intimates what a great deal of
stress is laid upon this as the main matter, in that and other holy
exercises, that they be done to God, even to him, with an eye to his
word as our rule, and his glory as our end, in them, seeking to please
him and to obtain his favour, and studious by the sincerity of our
intention to approve ourselves to him. When this was wanting every fast
was but a jest. To fast, and not fast to God, was to mock him and
provoke him, and could not be pleasing to him. Those that make fasting a
cloak for sin, as Jezebel's fast, or by it make their court to men for
their applause, as the Pharisees, or that rest in outward expressions of
humiliation while their hearts are unhumbled, as Ahab, do they fast to
God, even to him? Is this the fast that God has chosen? [Isa
58:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#005.md). If the solemnities of our
fasting, though frequent, long, and severe, do not serve to put an edge
upon devout affections, to quicken prayer, to increase godly sorrow, and
to alter the temper of our minds and the course of our lives for the
better, they do not at all answer the intention, and God will not accept
them as performed to him, even to him. (2.) They had the same eye to
themselves in their fasting that they had in their eating and drinking
([Zac 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#006).md): "When you did eat, and
when you did drink, on other days (nay, perhaps on your fast-days, in
the observation of which you could, when you saw cause, dispense with
yourselves, and take a liberty to eat and drink), did you not eat for
yourselves and drink for yourselves? Have you not always done as you had
a mind yourselves? Why then do you now pretend a desire to know the mind
of God? In your religious feasts and thanksgivings you have had no more
an eye to God than in your fasts." Or, rather, it refers to their common
meals; they did no more design the honour of God in their fasting and
praying than they did in their eating and drinking; but self was still
the centre in which the lines of all their actions, natural, civil, and
religious, met. They needed not be in such care about the continuance of
their fasts, unless they had kept them better. Note, We miss our end in
eating and drinking when we eat to ourselves and drink to ourselves,
whereas we should eat and drink to the glory of God ([Co1
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#031).md), that our bodies may be fit to
serve our souls in his service.

2\. The principal good thing they should have done was left undone ([Zac
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#007).md): "Should you not hear the words
which the Lord has cried by the former prophets? Yes, that you should
have done on your fast-days; it was not enough to weep and separate
yourselves on your fast-days, in token of your sorrow for the judgments
you were under, but you should have searched the scriptures of the
prophets, that you might have seen what was the ground of God's
controversy with your fathers, and might have taken warning by their
miseries not to tread in the steps of their iniquities. You ask, Shall
we do as we have done, in fasting? No, you must do that which you have
not yet done; you must repent of your sins and reform you lives. This is
what we now call you to, and it is the same that the former prophets
called your fathers to." To affect them the more with the mischief that
sin had done them, that they might be brought to repent of it, he puts
them in mind of the former flourishing state of their country: Jerusalem
was then inhabited and in prosperity, that is now desolate and in
distress. The cities round about, that are now in ruins, were then
inhabited too and in peace. The country likewise was very populous: Men
inhabited the south of the plain, which was not at all fortified, and
yet they lived safely, and which was fruitful, and so they lived
plentifully. But then God by the prophets cried to them, as one in
earnest, and importunate with them, to amend their ways and doings, or
else their prosperity would soon be at an end. "Now," says the prophet,
"you should have taken notice of that, and have inferred that what was
required of them for the preventing of the judgments, and which they did
not, is required of you for the removal of the judgments; and, if you do
it not, all your fasting and weeping signify nothing." Note, The words
of the later prophets agree with those of the former; and, whether
people are in prosperity or adversity, they must be called upon to leave
their sins and do their duty; this must still be the burden of every
song.

[Zechariah 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 7:8</span></span>

What was said [Zac 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#007.md), that they
should have heard the words of the former prophets, is here enlarged
upon, for warning to these hypocritical enquirers, who continued their
sins when they asked with great preciseness whether they should continue
their fasts. This prophet had before put them in mind of their fathers'
disobedience to the calls of the prophets, and what was the consequence
of it ([Zac 1:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#004).md), and now here
again; for others' harms should be our warnings. God's judgments upon
Israel of old for their sins were written for admonition to us
Christians ([Co1 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011).md), and the same
use we should make of similar providences in our own day.

I. This prophet here repeats the heads of the sermons which the former
prophets preached to their fathers ([Zac
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#009.md), [Zac
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#010).md), because the very same things
were required of them now. "Thus does the Lord of hosts speak to you
now, and thus he did speak to your fathers, saying, Execute true
judgment." The duties here required of them, which would have been the
lengthening of the tranquillity of their fathers and must be the
restoring of their tranquillity, are not keeping fasts and offering
sacrifices, but doing justly and loving mercy, duties which they were
bound to by the light and law of nature, though there had been no
prophets sent to insist upon them, duties which had a direct tendency to
the public welfare and peace, and which they themselves would be the
gainers by, and not God. 1. Magistrates must administer justice
impartially, according to the maxims of the law and the merits of the
cause, without respect of persons: "Judge judgment of truth, and execute
it when you have judged it." 2. Neighbours must have a tender concern
for one another, and must not only do one another no wrong, but must be
ready to do one another all the good offices that lie in their power.
They must show mercy and compassion every man to his brother, as the
case called for it. The infirmities of others, as well as their
calamities, are to be looked upon with compassion. Hanc veniam
petimusque damusque vicissim - This kindness we ask and exercise. 3.
They must not bear hard upon those whom they have advantage against, and
who, they know, are not able to help themselves. They must not, either
in commerce or in course of law, oppress the widow, the fatherless, the
stranger, and the poor, [Zac 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#010.md). The
weakest must not be thrust to the wall because they are weakest. No
thanks to men not to deny right to those who are in a capacity to demand
it and recover it; but we must, not only for wrath, but also for
conscience' sake, give those their own who have not power to force it
from us. Or it intimates that that which is but exactness with others is
exaction upon the widows and the fatherless; nay, that not relieving and
helping them as we ought is, in effect, oppressing them. 4. They must
not only not do wrong to any, but they must not so much as desire it nor
think of it: "Let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your
heart. Do not project it; do not wish it; nay do not so much as please
yourself with the fancy of it." The law of God lays a restraint upon the
heart, and forbids the entertaining, forbids the admitting, of a
malicious, spiteful, ill-natured thought. [Deu
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#009.md), Beware that there be not a
thought in thy Belial heart against thy brother.

II\. He describes the wilfulness and disobedience of their fathers, who
persisted in all manner of wickedness and injustice, notwithstanding
these exhortations and admonitions frequently given them in God's name;
various expressions to this purport are here heaped up ([Zac
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#011.md), [Zac
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#012).md), setting forth the stubbornness
of that carnal mind which is enmity against God, and is not in
subjection to the law of God, neither indeed can be. They were obstinate
and refractory, and persisted in their transgressions of the law purely
from a spirit of contradiction to the law. 1. They would not, if they
could help it, come within hearing of the prophets, but kept at a
distance; or, if they could not avoid hearing what they said, yet they
resolved they would not heed it: They refused to hearken, and looked
another way as if they had not been spoken to. 2. If they did hear what
was said to them, and, as it seemed, inclined at first to comply with
it, yet they flew off when it came to the setting to, and, like a
bullock unaccustomed to the yoke, they pulled away the shoulder, and
would not submit to the easy yoke and the light burden of God's
commandments. They gave a withdrawing shoulder (so the word is); they
seemed to lay their shoulder to the work, but they presently withdrew it
again, as those [Jer 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#010.md), [Jer
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#011.md). They were like a deceitful bow,
as that son that said, I go, sir, but went not. 3. They filled their own
minds with prejudices against the word of God, and had some objection or
other ready wherewith to fortify themselves against every sermon they
heard. They stopped their ears, that they should not hear, as the deaf
adder ([Psa 58:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#004).md), and none are so
deaf as those that will not hear, that make their own ear heavy, as the
word is. 4. They resolved that nothing which was said to them, for the
enforcing of these injunctions, should make any impression upon them:
They made their hearts as an adamant-stone, as a diamond, the hardest of
stones to be wrought upon, or as a flint, which the mason cannot hew
into shape as he can other stone out of the quarry. Nothing is so hard,
so unmalleable, so inflexible, as the heart of a presumptuous sinner;
and those whose hearts are hard may thank themselves; they are of their
own hardening, and it is just with God to give them over to a reprobate
sense, to the hardness and impenitence of their own hearts. These
stubborn sinners hardened their hearts on purpose lest they should hear
what God said to them by the written word, by the law of Moses, and by
the words of the prophets that preached to them; they had Moses and the
prophets, but resolved they would hear neither, nor would they have been
persuaded though one had been sent to them from the dead. The words of
the prophet were not regarded by them, though they were words which the
Lord of hosts sent and directed to them, though he sent them immediately
by his Spirit in the prophets; so that in despising them they affronted
God himself and resisted the Holy Ghost. Note, The reason why men are
not good is because they will not be so; they will not consider, will
not comply; and therefore, if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.

III\. He shows the fatal consequences of it to their fathers: Therefore
came great wrath from the Lord of hosts. God was highly displeased with
them, and justly; he required nothing of them but what was reasonable in
itself and beneficial to them; and yet they refused, and in a most
insolent manner too. What master could bear to be so abused by his own
servant? Such an implacable enmity to the gospel as this was to the law
and the prophets was that which brought wrath to the uttermost upon the
last generation of the Jewish church, [Th1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016.md). Great sins against the Lord of
hosts, whose authority is incontestable, bring great wrath from the Lord
of hosts, whose power is irresistible. And the effect was, 1. As they
had turned a deaf ear to God's word, so God turned a deaf ear to their
prayers, [Zac 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#013.md). As he cried to
them in their prosperity to leave their sins, and they would not hear,
but persisted in their iniquities, so they cried to him in the day of
their trouble to remove his judgments, and he would not hear, but
lengthened out their calamities. Those that set God at defiance, in the
height of their pride, when pangs came upon them cried unto him. Lord,
in trouble have they visited thee. But God has said it, and will abide
by it, He that turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer
shall be an abomination, [Pro 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#009.md);
[Pro 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#024.md), etc. Iniquity, regarded in
the heart, will certainly spoil the success of prayer, [Psa
66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018.md). 2. As they flew off from their
duty and allegiance to God, and were of desultory and unsettled spirits,
so God dissipated them and threw them about as chaff before a whirlwind:
He scattered them among all the nations whom they knew not, and whom
therefore they could not expect to receive any kindness from, [Zac
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#014.md). 3. As they violated all the laws
of their land, so God took away all the glories of it: Their land was
desolate after them, and no man passed through or returned. All that
country that was the kingdom of the two tribes, after the dispersion of
the remaining Jews, upon the slaughter of Gedaliah, was left utterly
uninhabited; there was not man, woman, or child, in it, till the Jews
returned at the end of seventy years' captivity; nay, it should seem,
the very roads that lay through the country were deserted (none passed
or repassed), which, as it had an intimation of mercy in it (though they
were cast out of it, yet it was kept empty for their return), so for the
present it made the judgment appear much the more dismal; for what a
horrid wilderness must a land be that had been so many years
uninhabited! And they might thank themselves; it was they that by their
own wickedness laid the pleasant land desolate. It was not so much the
Chaldeans that did it. No; they did it themselves. The desolations of a
land are owing to the wickedness of its inhabitants, [Psa
107:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#034.md). This came of their wilful
disobedience to the law of God. And the present generation saw how
desolate sin had made that pleasant land, and yet would not take
warning.
