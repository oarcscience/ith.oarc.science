### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#001.md)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles)](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sol 6:0</span></span>

In this chapter, I. The daughters of Jerusalem, moved with the
description which the church had given of Christ, enquire after him
([Sol 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#001).md). II. The church directs
them where they may meet with him ([Sol
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#002.md), [Sol
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#003).md). III. Christ is now found of
those that sought him, and very highly applauds the beauty of his
spouse, as one extremely smitten with it ([Sol
6:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#004).md), preferring her before all
others ([Sol 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#008.md), [Sol
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#009).md), recommending her to the love and
esteem of all her neighbours ([Sol
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#010).md), and, lastly, acknowledging the
impressions which her beauty had made upon him and the great delight he
took in it ([Sol 6:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#011).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 6:1</span></span>

Here is, I. The enquiry which the daughters of Jerusalem made concerning
Christ, [Sol 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#001.md). They still continue
their high thoughts of the church, and call her, as before, the fairest
among women; for true sanctity is true beauty. And now they raise their
thoughts higher concerning Christ: Whither has thy beloved gone, that we
may seek him with thee? This would be but an indecent, unacceptable,
compliment, if the song were not to be understood spiritually; for love
is jealous of a rival, would monopolize the beloved, and cares not that
others should join in seeking him; but those that truly love Christ are
desirous that others should love him too, and be joined to him; nay, the
greatest instance of duty and respect that the church's children can
show to their mother is to join with her in seeking Christ. The
daughters of Jerusalem, who had asked ([Sol
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#009).md), What is thy beloved more than
another beloved? wondering that the spouse should be so passionately in
love with him, are now of another mind, and are themselves in love with
him; for, 1. The spouse had described him, and shown them his
excellencies and perfections; and therefore, though they have not seen
him, yet, believing, they love him. Those that undervalue Christ do so
because they do not know him; when God, by his word and Spirit,
discovers him to the soul, with that ray of light the fire of love to
him will be kindled. 2. The spouse had expressed her own love to him,
her rest in that love, and triumphed in it: This is my beloved; and that
flame in her breast scattered sparks into theirs. As sinful lusts, when
they break out, defile many, so the pious zeal of some may provoke many,
[Co2 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002.md). 3. The spouse had bespoken
their help in seeking her beloved ([Sol
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#008).md); but now they beg hers, for they
perceive that now the cloud she had been under began to scatter, and the
sky to clear up, and, while she was describing her beloved to them, she
herself retrieved her comfort in him. Drooping Christians would find
benefit themselves by talking of Christ, as well as do good to others.
Now here, (1.) They enquire concerning him, "Wither has thy beloved
gone? which may must we steer our course in pursuit of him?" Note, Those
that are made acquainted with the excellencies of Christ, and the
comfort of an interest in him, cannot but be inquisitive after him and
desirous to know where they may meet with him. (2.) They offer their
service to the spouse to accompany her in quest of him: We will seek him
with thee. Those that would find Christ must seek him, seek him early,
seek him diligently; and it is best seeking Christ in concert, to join
with those that are seeking him. We must seek for communion with Christ
in communion with saints. We know whither our beloved has gone; he has
gone to heaven, to his Father, and our Father. He took care to send us
notice of it, that we might know how to direct to him, [Joh
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017.md). We must by faith see him there,
and by prayer seek him there, with boldness enter into the holiest, and
herein must join with the generation of those that seek him ([Psa
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#006).md), even with all that in every
place call upon him, [Co1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#002.md). We must
pray with and for others.

II\. The answer which the spouse gave to this enquiry, [Sol
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#002.md), [Sol
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#003.md). Now she complains not any more,
as she had done ([Sol 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#006).md), "He is
gone, he is gone," that she knew not where to find him, or doubted she
had lost him for ever; no,

1\. Now she knows very well where he is ([Sol
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#002).md): "My beloved is not to be found
in the streets of the city, and the crowd and noise that are there;
there I have in vain looked for him" (as his parents sought him among
their kindred and acquaintance, and found him not); "but he has gone
down to his garden, a place of privacy and retirement." The more we
withdraw from the hurry of the world the more likely we are to have
acquaintance with Christ, who took his disciples into a garden, there to
be witnesses of the agonies of his love. Christ's church is a garden
enclosed, and separated from the open common of the world; it is his
garden, which he has planted as he did the garden of Eden, which he
takes care of, and delights in. Though he had gone up to the paradise
above, yet he comes down to his garden on earth; it lies low, but he
condescends to visit it, and wonderful condescension it is. Will God in
very deed dwell with man upon the earth? Those that would find Christ
may expect to meet with him in his garden the church, for there he
records his name ([Exo 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#024).md); they
must attend upon him in the ordinances which he has instituted, the
word, sacraments, and prayer, wherein he will be with us always, even to
the end of the world. The spouse here refers to what Christ had said
([Sol 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#001).md), I have come into my
garden. It is as if she had said, "What a fool was I to fret and fatigue
myself in seeking him where he was not, when he himself had told me
where he was!" Words of direction and comfort are often out of the way
when we have occasion to use them, till the blessed Spirit brings them
to our remembrance, and then we wonder how we overlooked them. Christ
has told us that he would come into his garden; thither therefore we
must go to seek him. The beds, and smaller gardens, in this greater, are
the particular churches, the synagogues of God in the land ([Psa
84:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#008).md); the spices and lilies are
particular believers, the planting of the Lord, and pleasant in his
eyes. When Christ comes down to his church it is, (1.) To feed among the
gardens, to feed his flock, which he feeds not, as other shepherds, in
the open fields, but in his garden, so well are they provided for, [Psa
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#002.md). He comes to feed his friends,
and entertain them; there you may not only find him, but find his table
richly furnished, and a hearty welcome to it. He comes to feed himself,
that is, to please himself with the products of his own grace in his
people; for the Lord takes pleasure in those that fear him. He has many
gardens, many particular churches of different sizes and shapes; but,
while they are his, he feeds in them all, manifests himself among them,
and is well pleased with them. (2.) To gather lilies, wherewith he is
pleased to entertain and adorn himself. He picks the lilies one by one,
and gathers them to himself; and there will be a general harvest of them
at the great day, when he will send forth his angels, to gather all his
lilies, that he may be for ever glorified and admired in them.

2\. She is very confident of her own interest in him ([Sol
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#003).md): "I am my beloved's, and my
beloved is mine; the relation is mutual, and the knot is tied, which
cannot be loosed; for he feeds among the lilies, and my communion with
him is a certain token of my interest in him." She had said this before
([Sol 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#016)); but, (1..md) Here she
repeats it as that which she resolved to abide by, and which she took an
unspeakable pleasure and satisfaction in; she liked her choice too well
to change. Our communion with God is very much maintained and kept up by
the frequent renewing of our covenant with him and rejoicing in it. (2.)
She had occasion to repeat it, for she had acted unkindly to her
beloved, and, for her so doing, he had justly withdrawn himself from
her, and therefore there was occasion to take fresh hold of the
covenant, which continues firm between Christ and believes,
notwithstanding their failings and his frowns, [Psa
89:30-35](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#030.md). "I have been careless and
wanting in my duty, and yet I am my beloved's;" for every transgression
in the covenant does not throw us out of covenant. "He has justly hidden
his face from me and denied me his comforts, and yet my beloved is
mine;" for rebukes and chastenings are not only consistent with, but
they flow from covenant-love. (3.) When we have not a full assurance of
Christ's love we must live by a faithful adherence to him. "Though I
have not the sensible consolation I used to have, yet I will cleave to
this, Christ is mine and I am his." (4.) Though she had said the same
before, yet now she inverts the order, and asserts her interest in her
first: I am my beloved's, entirely devoted and dedicated to him; and
then her interest in him and in his grace: "My beloved is mine, and I am
happy, truly happy in him." If our own hearts can but witness for us
that we are his, there is no room left to question his being ours; for
the covenant never breaks on his side. (5.) It is now her comfort, as it
was then, that he feeds among the lilies, that he takes delight in his
people and converses freely with them, as we do with those with whom we
feed; and therefore, though at present he be withdrawn, "I shall meet
with him again. I shall yet praise him who is the health of my
countenance, and my God."

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sol 6:4</span></span>

Now we must suppose Christ graciously returned to his spouse, from whom
he had withdrawn himself, returned to converse with her (for he speaks
to her and makes her to hear joy and gladness), returned to favour her,
having forgiven and forgotten all her unkindness, for he speaks very
tenderly and respectfully to her.

I. He pronounces her truly amiable ([Sol
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#004).md): Thou art beautiful, O my love!
as Tirzah, a city in the tribe of Manasseh, whose name signifies
pleasant, or acceptable, the situation, no doubt, being very happy and
the building fine and uniform. Thou art comely as Jerusalem, a city
compact together ([Psa 122:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#003).md), and
which Solomon had built and beautified, the joy of the whole earth; it
was an honour to the world (whether they thought so or no) that there
was such a city in it. It was the holy city, and that was the greatest
beauty of it; and fitly is the church compared to it, for it was figured
and typified by it. The gospel-church is the Jerusalem that is above
([Gal 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026).md), the heavenly Jerusalem
([Heb 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022).md); in it God has his
sanctuary, and is, in a special manner, present; thence he has the
tribute of praise issuing; it is his rest for ever, and therefore it is
comely as Jerusalem, and, being so, is terrible as an army with banners.
Church-censures, duly administered, strike an awe upon men's
consciences; the word (the weapons of her warfare) casts down
imaginations ([Co2 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005).md), and even an
unbeliever is convinced and judged by the solemnity of holy ordinances,
[Co1 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#024.md), [Co1
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#025.md). The saints by faith overcome
the world ([Jo1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004).md); nay, like Jacob,
they have power with God and prevail, [Gen
32:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#028.md).

II\. He owns himself in love with her, [Sol
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#005.md). Though, for a small moment, and
in a little wrath, he had hid his face from her, yet now he gathers her
with very surprising instances of everlasting lovingkindness, [Isa
54:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#008.md). Turn thy eyes towards me (so
some read it), "turn the eyes of faith and love towards me, for they
have lifted me up; look unto me, and be comforted." When we are calling
to God to turn the eye of his favour towards us he is calling to us to
turn the eye of our obedience towards him. We read it as a strange
expression of love, "Turn away thy eyes from me, for I cannot bear the
brightness of them; they have quite overcome me, and I am prevailed with
to overlook all that is past;" as God said to Moses, when he interceded
for Israel, "Let me alone, or I must yield," [Exo
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#010.md). Christ is pleased to borrow
these expressions of a passionate lover only to express the tenderness
of a compassionate Redeemer, and the delight he takes in his redeemed
and in the workings of his own grace in them.

III\. He repeats, almost word for word, part of the description he had
given of her beauty ([Sol 4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001).md), her
hair, her teeth, her temples ([Sol
6:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#005).md), not because he could not have
described it in other words, and by other similitudes, but to show that
he had still the same esteem for her since her unkindness to him, and
his withdrawings from her, that he had before. Lest she should think
that, though he would not quite cast her off, yet he would think the
worse of her while he knew her, he says the same of her now that he had
done; for those to whom much is forgiven will love the more, and,
consequently, will be the more loved, for Christ has said, I love those
that love me. He is pleased with his people, notwithstanding their
weaknesses, when they sincerely repent of them and return to their duty,
and commends them as if they had already arrived at perfection.

IV\. He prefers her before all competitors, and sees all the beauties
and perfections of others meeting and centering in her ([Sol
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#008.md), [Sol
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#009).md): "There are, it may be,
threescore queens, who, like Esther, have by their beauty attained to
the royal state and dignity, and fourscore concubines, whom kings have
preferred before their own queens, as more charming, and these attended
by their maids of honour, virgins without number, who, when there is a
ball at court, appear in great splendour, with beauty that dazzles the
eyes of the spectators; but my dove, my undefiled, is but one, a holy
one." 1. She excels them all. Go through all the world, and view the
societies of men that reckon themselves wise and happy, kingdoms,
courts, senates, councils, or whatever incorporations you may think
valuable, they are none of them to be compared with the church of
Christ; their honours and beauties are nothing to hers. Who is like unto
thee, O Israel! [Deu 33:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029.md); [Deu
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#006.md), [Deu
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#007.md). There are particular persons, as
virgins without number, who are famed for their accomplishments, the
beauties of their address, language, and performances, but the beauty of
holiness is beyond all other beauty: "My dove, my undefiled, is one, has
that one beauty that she is a dove, an undefiled dove, and mine, and
that makes her excel the queens and virgins, though they were ever so
many." 2. She included them all. "Other kings have many queens, and
concubines, and virgins, with whose conversation they entertain
themselves, but my dove, my undefiled, is to me instead of all; in that
one I have more than they have in all theirs." Or, "Though there are
many particular churches, some of greater dignity, others of less, some
of longer, others of shorter, standing, and many particular believers,
of different gifts and attainments, some more eminent, others less so,
yet they all constitute but one catholic church, are all but parts of
that whole, and that is my dove, my undefiled." Christ is the centre of
the church's unity; all the children of God that are scattered abroad
are gathered by him ([Joh 11:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#052).md), and
meet in him ([Eph 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010).md), and are all
his doves.

V. He shows how much she was esteemed, not by him only, but by all that
had acquaintance with her and stood in relation to her. It would add to
her praise to say, 1. That she was her mother's darling; she had that in
her, from a child, which recommended her to the particular affection of
her parents. As Solomon himself is said to have been tender and an only
one in the sight of his mother ([Pro
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#003).md), so was she the only one of her
mother, as dear as if she had been an only one, and, if there were many
more, yet she was the choice one of her that bore her, more excellent
than all the societies of men this world ever produced. All the kingdoms
of the world, and the glory of them, are nothing, in Christ's account,
compared with the church, which is made up of the excellent ones of the
earth, the precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, and more
excellent than their neighbours. 2. That she was admired by all her
acquaintance, not only the daughters, who were her juniors, but even the
queens and the concubines, who might have reason to be jealous of her as
a rival; they all blessed her, and wished well to her, praised her, and
spoke well of her. The daughters of Jerusalem called her the fairest
among women; all agreed to give her the pre-eminence for beauty, and
every sheaf bowed to hers. Note, (1.) Those that have any correct sense
of things cannot but be convinced in their consciences (whatever they
say) that godly people are excellent people; many will give them their
good word, and more their good-will. (2.) Jesus Christ takes notice what
people think and speak of his church, and is well pleased with those
that honour such as fear the Lord, and takes it ill of those that
despise them, particularly when they are under a cloud, that offend any
of his little ones.

VI\. He produces the encomium that was given of her, and makes it his
own ([Sol 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#010).md): Who is she that looks
forth as the morning? This is applicable both to the church in the world
and to grace in the heart.

1\. They are amiable as the light, the most beautiful of all visible
things. Christians are, or should be, the lights of the world. The
patriarchal church looked forth as the morning when the promise of the
Messiah was first made known, and the day-spring from on high visited
this dark world. The Jewish church was fair as the moon; the ceremonial
law was an imperfect light; it shone by reflection; it was changing as
the moon, did not make day, nor had the sun of righteousness yet risen.
But the Christian church is clear as the sun, exhibits a great light to
those that sat in darkness. Or we may apply it to the kingdom of grace,
the gospel-kingdom. (1.) In its rise, it looks forth as the morning
after a dark night; it is discovering ([Job
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#012.md), [Job
38:13](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#013).md), and very acceptable, looks
forth pleasantly as a clear morning; but it is small in its beginnings,
and scarcely perceptible at first. (2.) It is, at the best, in this
world, but fair as the moon, which shines with a borrowed light, which
has her changes and eclipses, and her spots too, and, when at the full,
does but rule by night. But, (3.) When it is perfected in the kingdom of
glory then it will be clear as the sun, the church clothed with the sun,
with Christ the sun of righteousness, [Rev
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#001.md). Those that love God will then be
as the sun when he goes forth in his strength ([Jdg
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#031.md); [Mat
13:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#043).md); they shall shine in
inexpressible glory, and that which is perfect will then come; there
shall be no darkness, no spots, [Isa
30:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#026.md).

2\. The beauty of the church and of believers is not only amiable, but
awful as an army with banners. The church, in this world, is as an army,
as the camp of Israel in the wilderness; its state is militant; it is in
the midst of enemies, and is engaged in a constant conflict with them.
Believers are soldiers in this army. It has its banners; the gospel of
Christ is an ensign ([Isa 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012).md), the
love of Christ, [Sol 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#004.md). It is
marshalled, and kept in order and under discipline. It is terrible to
its enemies as Israel in the wilderness was, [Exo
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#014.md). When Balaam saw Israel encamped
according to their tribes, by their standards, with colours displayed,
he said, How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob! [Num
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#005.md). When the church preserves her
purity she secures her honour and victory; when she is fair as the moon,
and clear as the sun, she is truly great and formidable.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sol 6:11</span></span>

Christ having now returned to his spouse, and the breach being entirely
made up, and the falling out of these lovers being the renewing of love,
Christ here gives an account both of the distance and of the
reconciliation.

I. That when he had withdrawn from his church as his spouse, and did not
comfort her, yet even then he had his eye upon it as his garden, which
he took care of ([Sol 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#011).md): "I went
down into the garden of nuts, or nutmegs, to see the fruits of the
valley, with complacency and concern, to see them as my own." When he
was out of sight he was no further off than the garden, hid among the
trees of the garden, in a low and dark valley; but then he was observing
how the vine flourished, that he might do all that to it which was
necessary to promote its flourishing, and might delight himself in it as
a man does in a fruitful garden. He went to see whether the pomegranates
budded. Christ observes the first beginnings of the good work of grace
in the soul and the early buddings of devout affections and inclinations
there, and is well pleased with them, as we are with the blossoms of the
spring.

II\. That yet he could not long content himself with this, but suddenly
felt a powerful, irresistible, inclination in his own bosom to return to
his church, as his spouse, being moved with her lamentations after him,
and her languishing desire towards him ([Sol
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#012).md): "Or ever I was aware, my soul
made me like the chariots of Ammi-nadib; I could not any longer keep at
a distance; my repentings were kindled together, and I presently
resolved to fly back to the arms of my love, my dove." Thus Joseph made
himself strange to his brethren, for a while, to chastise them for their
former unkindnesses, and make trial of their present temper, till he
could no longer refrain himself, but, or ever he was aware, burst out
into tears, and said, I am Joseph, [Gen
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#001.md), [Gen
45:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#003.md). And now the spouse perceives, as
David did ([Psa 31:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#022).md), that though
she said in her haste, I am cut off from before thy eyes, yet, at the
same time, he heard the voice of her supplications, and became like the
chariots of Ammi-nadib, which were noted for their beauty and swiftness.
My soul put me into the chariots of my willing people (so some read it),
"the chariots of their faith, and hope, and love, their desires, and
prayers, and expectations, which they sent after me, to fetch me back,
as chariots of fire with horses of fire." Note, 1. Christ's people are,
and ought to be, a willing people. 2. If they continue seeking Christ
and longing after him, even when he seems to withdraw from them, he will
graciously return to them in due time, perhaps sooner than they think
and with a pleasing surprise. No chariots sent for Christ shall return
empty. 3. All Christ's gracious returns to his people take rise from
himself. It is not they, it is his own soul, that puts him into the
chariots of his people; for he is gracious because he will be gracious,
and loves his Israel because he would love them; not for their sakes, be
it known to them.

III\. That he, having returned to her, kindly courted her return to him,
notwithstanding the discouragements she laboured under. Let her not
despair of obtaining as much comfort as ever she had before this
distance happened, but take the comfort of the return of her beloved,
[Sol 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#013.md). Here, 1. The church is
called Shulamite, referring either to Solomon, the bridegroom in type,
by whose name she is called, in token of her relation to him and union
with him (thus believers are called Christians from Christ), or
referring to Salem, the place of her birth and residence, as the woman
of Shunem is called the Shunamite. Heaven is the Salem whence the saints
have their birth, and where they have their citizenship; those that
belong to Christ, and are bound for heaven, shall be called Shulamites.
2. She is invited to return, and the invitation most earnestly pressed:
Return, return; and again, "Return, return; recover the peace thou hast
lost and forfeited; come back to thy former composedness and
cheerfulness of spirit." Note, Good Christians, after they have had
their comfort disturbed, are sometimes hard to be pacified, and need to
be earnestly persuaded to return again to their rest. As revolting
sinners have need to be called to again and again (Turn you, turn you,
why will you die?) so disquieted saints have need to be called to again
and again, Turn you, turn you, why will you droop; Why art thou cast
down, O my soul? 3. Having returned, she is desired to show her face:
That we may look upon thee. Go no longer with they face covered like a
mourner. Let those that have made their peace with God lift up their
faces without spot ([Job 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#026).md); let
them come boldly to his throne of grace. Christ is pleased with the
cheerfulness and humble confidence of his people, and would have them
look pleasant. "Let us look upon thee, not I only, but the holy angels,
who rejoice in the consolation of saints as well as in the conversion of
sinners; not I only, but all the daughters." Christ and believers are
pleased with the beauty of the church. 4. A short account is given of
what is to be seen in her. The question is asked, What will you see in
the Shulamite? And it is answered, As it were the company of two armies.
(1.) Some think she gives this account of herself; she is shy of
appearing, unwilling to be looked upon, having, in her own account, no
form or comeliness. Alas! says she, What will you see in the Shulamite?
nothing that is worth your looking upon, nothing but as it were the
company of two armies actually engaged, where nothing is to be seen but
blood and slaughter. The watchmen had smitten her, and wounded her, and
she carried in her face the marks of those wounds, looked as if she had
been fighting. She had said ([Sol
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006).md), Look not upon me because I am
black; here she says, "Look not upon me because I am bloody." Or it may
denote the constant struggle that is between grace and corruption in the
souls of believers; they are in them as two armies continually
skirmishing, which makes her ashamed to show her face. (2.) Others think
her beloved gives the account of her. "I will tell you what you shall
see in the Shulamite; you shall see as noble a sight as that of two
armies, or two parts of the same army, drawn out in rank and file; not
only as an army with banners, but as two armies, with a majesty double
to what was before spoken; she is as Mahanaim, as the two hosts which
Jacob saw ([Gen 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#001.md), [Gen
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#002).md), a host of saints and a host of
angels ministering to them; the church militant, the church triumphant."
Behold two armies; in both the church appears beautiful.
