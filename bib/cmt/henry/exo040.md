### [Exodus Chapter 40](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 40:0</span></span>

In this chapter, I. Orders are given for the setting up of the
tabernacle and the fixing of all the appurtenances of it in their proper
places ([Exo 40:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#001).md), and the
consecrating of it ([Exo 40:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#009).md), and
of the priests ([Exo 40:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#012).md). II.
Care is taken to do all this, and as it was appointed to be done (v.
16-33). III. God takes possession of it by the cloud ([Exo
40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034), etc..md).

[Exodus 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 40:1</span></span>

The materials and furniture of the tabernacle had been viewed severally
and approved, and now they must be put together. 1. God here directs
Moses to set up the tabernacle and the utensils of it in their places.
Though the work of the tabernacle was finished, and every thing ready
for rearing, and the people, no doubt, were very desirous to see it up,
yet Moses will not erect it till he has express orders for doing so. It
is good to see God going before us in every step, [Psa
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#023.md). The time for doing this is
fixed to the first day of the first month ([Exo
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#002).md), which wanted but fourteen days
of a year since they came out of Egypt; and a good year's work there was
done in it. Probably the work was made ready but just at the end of the
year, so that the appointing of this day gave no delay, or next to none,
to this good work. We must not put off any necessary duty under pretence
of waiting for some remarkable day; the present season is the most
convenient. But the tabernacle happening to be set up on the first day
of the first month intimates that it is good to begin the year with some
good work. Let him that is the first have the first; and let the things
of his kingdom be first sought. In Hezekiah's time we find they began to
sanctify the temple on the first day of the first month, [Ch2
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#017.md). The new moon (which by their
computation was the first day of every month) was observed by them with
some solemnity; and therefore this first new moon of the year was thus
made remarkable. Note, When a new year begins, we should think of
serving God more and better than we did the year before. Moses is
particularly ordered to set up the tabernacle itself first, in which God
would dwell and would be served ([Exo
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#002).md), then to put the ark in its
place, and draw the veil before it ([Exo
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#003).md), then to fix the table, and the
candlestick, and the altar of incense, without the veil ([Exo
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#004.md), [Exo
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#005).md), and to fix the hanging of the
door before the door. Then in the court he must place the altar of burnt
offering, and the laver ([Exo 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#006.md),
[Exo 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#007).md); and, lastly, he must set
up the curtains of the court, and a hanging for a court-gate. And all
this would be easily done in one day, many hands no doubt being employed
in it under the direction of Moses. 2. He directs Moses, when he had set
up the tabernacle and all the furniture of it, to consecrate it and
them, by anointing them with the oil which was prepared for the purpose,
[Exo 30:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#025.md), etc. It was there ordered
that this should be done; here it was ordered that it should be done
now, [Exo 40:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#009.md). Observe, Every
thing was sanctified when it was put in its proper place, and not till
then, for till then it was not fit for the use to which it was to be
sanctified. As every thing is beautiful in its season, so is every thing
in its place. 3. He directs him to consecrate Aaron and his sons. When
the goods were brought into God's house, they were marked first, and
then servants were hired to bear the vessels of the Lord; and those must
be clean who were put into that office, [Exo
40:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#012.md). The law which was now
ordered to be put in execution we had before, ch. 29. Thus in the
visible church, which is God's tabernacle among men, it is requisite
that there be ministers to keep the charge of the sanctuary, and that
they receive the anointing.

[Exodus 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 40:16</span></span>

When the tabernacle and the furniture of it were prepared, they did not
put off the rearing of it till they came to Canaan, though they now
hoped to be there very shortly; but, in obedience to the will of God,
they set it up in the midst of their camp, while they were in the
wilderness. Those that are unsettled in the world must not think that
this will excuse them in their continued irreligion; as if it were
enough to begin to serve God when they begin to be settled in the world.
No; a tabernacle for God is a very needful and profitable companion even
in a wilderness, especially considering that our carcases may fall in
that wilderness, and we may be fixed in another world before we come to
fix in this.

The rearing of the tabernacle was a good day's work; the consecrating of
it, and of the priests, was attended to some days after. Here we have an
account only of that new-year's-day's work. 1. Moses not only did all
that God directed him to do, but in the order that God appointed; for
God will be sought in the due order. 2. To each particular there is
added an express reference to the divine appointment, which Moses
governed himself by as carefully and conscientiously as the workmen did;
and therefore, as before, so here it is repeated, as the Lord commanded
Moses, seven times in less than fourteen verses. Moses himself, as great
a man as he was, would not pretend to vary from the institution, neither
to add to it nor diminish from it, in the least punctilio. Those that
command others must remember that their Master also is in heaven, and
they must do as they are commanded. 3. That which was to be veiled be
veiled ([Exo 40:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#021).md), and that which
was to be used he used immediately, for the instruction of the priests,
that by seeing him do the several offices they might learn to do them
the more dexterously. Though Moses was not properly a priest, yet he is
numbered among the priests ([Psa
99:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#006).md), and the Jewish writers call him
the priest of the priests; what he did he did by special warrant and
direction from God, rather as a prophet, or law-giver, than as a priest.
He set the wheels a going, and then left the work in the hands of the
appointed ministry. (1.) When he had placed the table, he set the
show-bread in order upon it ([Exo
40:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#023).md); for God will never have his
table unfurnished. (2.) As soon as he had fixed the candlestick, he
lighted the lamps before the Lord, [Exo
40:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#025.md). Even that dark dispensation
would not admit of unlighted candles. (3.) The golden altar being put in
its place, immediately he burnt sweet incense thereon ([Exo
40:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#027).md); for God's altar must be a
smoking altar. (4.) The altar of the burnt-offering was no sooner set up
in the court of the tabernacle than he had a burnt-offering, and a
meat-offering, ready to offer upon it, [Exo
40:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#029.md). Some think, though this is
mentioned here, it was not done till some time after; but it seems to me
that he immediately began the ceremony of its consecration, though it
was not completed for seven days. (5.) At the laver likewise, when he
had fixed that, Moses himself washed his hands and feet. Thus, in all
these instances, he not only showed the priests how to do their duty,
but has taught us that God's gifts are intended for use, and not barely
for show. Though the altars, and table, and candlestick, were fresh and
new, he did not say it was a pity to sully them; no, he handselled them
immediately. Talents were given to be occupied, not to be buried.

[Exodus 40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">exo 40:34</span></span>

As when, in the creation, God had finished this earth, which he designed
for man's habitation, he made man, and put him in possession of it, so
when Moses had finished the tabernacle, which was designed for God's
dwelling-place among men, God came and took possession of it. The
shechinah, the divine eternal Word, though not yet made flesh, yet, as a
prelude to that event, came and dwelt among them, [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md). This was henceforward the place
of his throne, and the place of the soles of his feet ([Eze
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#007).md); here he resided, here he ruled.
By the visible tokens of God's coming among them to take possession of
the tabernacle he testified both the return of his favour to them, which
they had forfeited by the golden calf ([Exo
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#007).md), and his gracious acceptance of
all the expense they had been at, and all the care and pains they had
taken about the tabernacle. Thus God owned them, showed himself well
pleased with what they had done, and abundantly rewarded them. Note, God
will dwell with those that prepare him a habitation. The broken and
contrite heart, the clean and holy heart, that is furnished for his
service, and devoted to his honour, shall be his rest for ever; here
will Christ dwell by faith, [Eph 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017.md).
Where God has a throne and an altar in the soul, there is a living
temple. And God will be sure to own and crown the operations of his own
grace and the observance of his own appointments.

As God had manifested himself upon mount Sinai, so he did now in this
newly-erected tabernacle. We read ([Exo
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#016).md) that the glory of the Lord
abode upon mount Sinai, which is said to be like devouring fire ([Exo
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#017).md), and that the cloud covered it
on the outside, and the glory of the Lord filled it within, to which,
probably there is an allusion in [Zac
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005.md), where God promises to be a wall
of fire round about Jerusalem (and the pillar of cloud was by night a
pillar of fire) and the glory in the midst of her.

I. The cloud covered the tent. That same cloud which, as the chariot or
pavilion of the shechinah, had come up before them out of Egypt and led
them hither, now settled upon the tabernacle and hovered over it, even
in the hottest and clearest day; for it was none of those clouds which
the sun scatters. This cloud was intended to be, 1. A token of God's
presence constantly visible day and night ([Exo
40:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#038).md) to all Israel, even to those
that lay in the remotest corners of the camp, that they might never
again make a question of it, Is the Lord among us, or is he not? That
very cloud which had already been so pregnant with wonders in the Red
Sea, and on mount Sinai, sufficient to prove God in it of a truth, was
continually in sight of all the house of Israel throughout all their
journeys; so that they were inexcusable if they believed not their own
eyes. 2. A concealment of the tabernacle, and the glory of God in it.
God did indeed dwell among them, but he dwelt in a cloud: Verily thou
art a God that hidest, thyself. Blessed be God for the gospel of Christ,
in which we all with open face behold as in a glass, not in a cloud, the
glory of the Lord. 3. A protection of the tabernacle. They had sheltered
it with one covering upon another, but, after all, the cloud that
covered it was its best guard. Those that dwell in the house of the Lord
are hidden there, and are safe under the divine protection, [Psa
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md), [Psa
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005.md). Yet this, which was then a
peculiar favour to the tabernacle, is promised to every dwelling-place
of mount Zion ([Isa 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005).md); for upon all
the glory shall be a defence. 4. A guide to the camp of Israel in their
march through the wilderness, [Exo
40:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#036.md), [Exo
40:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#037.md). While the cloud continued on
the tabernacle, they rested; when it removed, they removed and followed
it, as being purely under divine direction. This is spoken of more
fully, [Num 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#019.md); [Psa
78:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#014.md); [Psa
105:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#039.md). As before the tabernacle was
set up the Israelites had the cloud for their guide, which appeared
sometimes in one place and sometimes in another, but henceforward rested
on the tabernacle and was to be found there only, so the church had
divine revelation for its guide from the first, before the scriptures
were written, but since the making up of that canon it rests in that as
its tabernacle, and there only it is to be found, as in the creation the
light which was made the first day, centered in the sun the fourth day.
Blessed be God for the law and the testimony!

II\. The glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle, [Exo
40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034.md), [Exo
40:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#035.md). The shechinah now made an awful
and pompous entry into the tabernacle, through the outer part of which
it passed into the most holy place, as the presence-chamber, and there
seated itself between the cherubim. It was in light and fire, and (for
aught we know) no otherwise, that the shechinah made itself visible; for
God is light; our God is a consuming fire. With these the tabernacle was
now filled, yet, as before the bush was not consumed, so now the
curtains were not so much as singed by this fire; for to those that have
received the anointing the terrible majesty of God is not destroying.
Yet so dazzling was the light, and so dreadful was the fire, that Moses
was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, at the door of
which he attended, till the splendour had a little abated, and the glory
of the Lord retired within the veil, [Exo
40:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#035.md). This shows how terrible the
glory and majesty of God are, and how unable the greatest and best of
men are to stand before him. The divine light and fire, let forth in
their full strength, will overpower the strongest heads and the purest
hearts. But what Moses could not do, in that he was weak through the
flesh, has been done by our Lord Jesus, whom God caused to draw near and
approach, and who, as the forerunner, has for us entered, and has
invited us to come boldly even to the mercy-seat. He was able to enter
into the holy place not made with hands ([Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024).md); nay, he is himself the true
tabernacle, filled with the glory of God ([Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014).md), even with the divine grace and
truth prefigured by this fire and light. In him the shechinah took up
its rest for ever, for in him dwells all the fulness of the godhead
bodily. Blessed be God for Jesus Christ!
