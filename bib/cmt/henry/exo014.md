### [Exodus Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 14:0</span></span>

The departure of the children of Israel out of Egypt (which was indeed
the birth of the Jewish church) is made yet more memorable by further
works of wonder, which were wrought immediately upon it. Witness the
records of this chapter, the contents whereof, together with a key to
it, we have, [Heb 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#029.md). "They passed
through the Red Sea as by dry land, which the Egyptians assaying to do
were drowned;" and this they did by faith, which intimates that there
was something typical and spiritual in it. Here is, I. The extreme
distress and danger that Israel was in at the Red Sea. 1. Notice was
given of it to Moses before ([Exo
14:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#001).md). 2. The cause of it was
Pharaoh's violent pursuit of them ([Exo
14:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#005).md). 3. Israel was in a great
consternation upon it ([Exo 14:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#010).md).
4. Moses endeavours to encourage them ([Exo
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#013.md), [Exo
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#014).md). II. The wonderful deliverance
that God wrought for them out of this distress. 1. Moses is instructed
concerning it ([Exo 14:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#015).md). 2.
Lines that could not be forced are set between the camp of Israel and
Pharaoh's camp ([Exo 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#019.md), [Exo
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#020).md). 3. By the divine power the Red
Sea is divided ([Exo 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#031).md), and is
made, (1.) A lane to the Israelites, who marched safely through it ([Exo
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#022.md), [Exo
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#029)). But, (2..md) To the Egyptians it
was made, \[1.\] An ambush into which they were drawn ([Exo
14:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#023).md). And, \[2.\] A grave in
which they were all buried ([Exo
14:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#026).md). III. The impressions this
made upon the Israelites ([Exo 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#030.md),
[Exo 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#031).md).

[Exodus 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 14:1</span></span>

We have here,

I. Instructions given to Moses concerning Israel's motions and
encampments, which were so very surprising that if Moses had not express
orders about them before they would scarcely have been persuaded to
follow the pillar of cloud and fire. That therefore there might be no
scruple nor dissatisfaction about it, Moses is told before, 1. Whither
they must go, [Exo 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#001.md), [Exo
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#002.md). They had got to the edge of the
wilderness ([Exo 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#020).md), and a stage
or two more would have brought them to Horeb, the place appointed for
their serving God; but, instead of going forward, they are ordered to
turn short off, on the right hand from Canaan, and to march towards the
Red Sea. Where they were, at Etham, there was no sea in their way to
obstruct their passage: but God himself orders them into straits, which
might give them an assurance that when his purposes were served he would
without fail bring them out of those straits. Note, God sometimes raises
difficulties in the way of the salvation of his people, that he may have
the glory of subduing them, and helping his people over them. 2. What
God designed in these strange orders. Moses would have yielded an
implicit obedience, though God had given him no reason; but shall he
hide from Moses the thing that he does? No, Moses shall know, (1.) That
Pharaoh has a design to ruin Israel, [Exo
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#003). (2..md) That therefore God has a
design to ruin Pharaoh, and he takes this way to effect it, [Exo
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#004.md). Pharaoh's sagacity would
conclude that Israel was entangled in the wilderness and so would become
an easy prey to him; and, that he might be the more apt to think so, God
orders them into yet greater entanglements; also, by turning them so
much out of their road, he amazes him yet more, and gives him further
occasion to suppose that they were in a state of embarrassment and
danger. And thus (says God) I will be honoured upon Pharaoh. Note,
\[1.\] All men being made for the honour of their Maker, those whom he
is not honoured by he will be honoured upon. \[2.\] What seems to tend
to the church's ruin is often overruled to the ruin of the church's
enemies, whose pride and malice are fed by Providence, that they may be
ripened for destruction.

II\. Pharaoh's pursuit of Israel, in which, while he gratifies his own
malice and revenge, he is furthering the accomplishment of God's
counsels concerning him. It was told him that the people fled, [Exo
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#005.md). Such a fright was he in, when he
gave them leave to go, that when the fright was a little over he either
forgot, or would not own, that they departed with his consent, and
therefore was willing that it should be represented to him as a revolt
from their allegiance. Thus what may easily be justified is easily
condemned, by putting false colours upon it. Now, hereupon,

1\. He reflects upon it with regret that he had connived at their
departure. He and his servants, though it was with the greatest reason
in the world that they had let Israel go, yet were now angry with
themselves for it: Why have we done thus? (1.) It vexed them that Israel
had their liberty, that they had lost the profit of their labours, and
the pleasure of chastising them. It is meat and drink to proud
persecutors to trample upon the saints of the Most High, and say to
their souls, Bow down, that we may go over; and therefore it vexes them
to have their hands tied. Note, The liberty of God's people is a heavy
grievance to their enemies, [Est 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#012.md),
[Est 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#013.md); [Act
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#017.md), [Act
5:33](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#033). (2..md) It aggravated the vexation
that they themselves had consented to it, thinking now that they might
have hindered it, and that they needed not to have yielded, though they
had stood it out to the last extremity. Thus God makes men's envy and
rage against his people a torment to themselves, [Psa
112:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#010.md). It was well done to let Israel
go, and what they would have reflected on with comfort if they had done
it from an honest principle; but doing it by constraint, they called
themselves a thousand fools for doing it, and passionately wished it
undone again. Note, It is very common, but very absurd and criminal, for
people to repent of their good deeds; their justice and charity, and
even their repentance, are repented of. See an instance somewhat like
this, [Jer 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#010.md), [Jer
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#011.md).

2\. He resolves, if possible, either to reduce them or to be revenged on
them; in order to this, he levies an army, musters all his force of
chariots and horsemen, [Exo 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#017.md),
[Exo 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#018.md) (for, it should seem, he
took no foot with him, because the king's business required haste), and
thus he doubts not but he shall re-enslave them, [Exo
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#006.md), [Exo
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#007.md). It is easy to imagine what a
rage Pharaoh was now in, roaring like a lion disappointed of his prey,
how his proud heart aggravated the affront, swelled with indignation,
scorned to be baffled, longed to be revenged: and now all the plagues
are as if they had never been. He has quite forgotten the sorrowful
funerals of his firstborn, and can think of nothing but making Israel
feel his resentments; now he thinks he can be too hard for God himself;
for, otherwise, could he have hoped to conquer a people so dear to him?
God gave him up to these passions of his own heart, and so hardened it.
It is said ([Exo 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#008).md), The children
of Israel went out with a high hand, that is, with a great deal of
courage and bravery, triumphing in their release, and resolved to break
through the difficulties that lay in their way. But the Egyptians ([Exo
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#009).md) pursued after them. Note, Those
that in good earnest set their faces heaven-ward, and will live godly in
Christ Jesus, must expect to be set upon by Satan's temptations and
terrors. He will not tamely part with any out of his service, nor go out
without raging, [Mar 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#026.md).

[Exodus 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 14:10</span></span>

We have here, I. The fright that the children of Israel were in when
they perceived that Pharaoh pursued them, [Exo
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#010.md). They knew very well the
strength and rage of the enemy, and their own weakness; numerous indeed
they were, but all on foot, unarmed, undisciplined, disquieted by long
servitude, and (which was worst of all) now penned up by the situation
of their camp, so that they could not make their escape. On the one hand
was Pi-hahiroth, a range of craggy rocks impassable; on the other hand
were Migdol and Baalzephon, which, some think were forts and garrisons
upon the frontiers of Egypt; before them was the sea; behind them were
the Egyptians: so that there was no way open for them but upwards, and
thence their deliverance came. Note, We may be in the way of our duty,
following God and hastening towards heaven, and yet may be in great
straits, troubled on every side, [Co2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008.md). In this distress, no marvel that
the children of Israel were sorely afraid; their father Jacob was so in
a like case ([Gen 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#007).md); when without
are fightings, it cannot be otherwise but that within are fears: what
therefore was the fruit of this fear? According as that was, the fear
was good or evil. 1. Some of them cried out unto the Lord; their fear
set them a praying, and that was a good effect of it. God brings us into
straits that he may bring us to our knees. 2. Others of them cried out
against Moses; their fear set them a murmuring, [Exo
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#011.md), [Exo
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#012.md). They give up themselves for
lost; and as if God's arm were shortened all of a sudden, and he were
not as able to work miracles today as he was yesterday, they despair of
deliverance, and can count upon nothing but dying in the wilderness. How
inexcusable was their distrust! Did they not see themselves under the
guidance and protection of a pillar from heaven? And can almighty power
fail them, or infinite goodness be false to them? Yet this was not the
worst; they quarrel with Moses for bringing them out of Egypt, and, in
quarrelling with him, fly in the face of God himself, and provoke him to
wrath whose favour was now the only succour they had to flee to. As the
Egyptians were angry with themselves for the best deed they ever did, so
the Israelites were angry with God for the greatest kindness that was
ever done them; so gross are the absurdities of unbelief. They here
express, (1.) A sordid contempt of liberty, preferring servitude before
it, only because it was attended with some difficulties. A generous
spirit would have said, "If the worst come to the worst," as we say, "It
is better to die in the field of honour than to live in the chains of
slavery;" nay, under God's conduct, they could not miscarry, and
therefore they might say, "Better live God's freemen in the open air of
a wilderness than the Egyptians' bondmen in the smoke of the
brick-kilns." But because, for the present, they are a little
embarrassed, they are angry that they were not left buried alive in
their house of bondage. (2.) Base ingratitude to Moses, who had been the
faithful instrument of their deliverance. They condemn him, as if he had
dealt hardly and unkindly with them, whereas it was evident, beyond
dispute, that whatever he did, and however it issued, it was by
direction from their God, and with design for their good. What they had
said in a former ferment (when they hearkened not to Moses for anguish
of spirit), they repeat and justify in this: We said in Egypt, Let us
alone; and it was ill-said, yet more excusable, because then they had
not had so much experience as they had now of God's wonderful
appearances in their favour. But they had as soon forgotten the miracles
of mercy as the Egyptians had forgotten the miracles of wrath; and they,
as well as the Egyptians, hardened their hearts, at last, to their own
ruin; as Egypt after ten plagues, so Israel after ten provocations, of
which this was the first ([Num 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#022).md),
were sentenced to die in the wilderness.

II\. The seasonable encouragement that Moses gave them in this distress,
[Exo 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#013.md), [Exo
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#014.md). He answered not these fools
according to their folly. God bore with the provocation they gave to
him, and did not (as he might justly have done) chose their delusions,
and bring their fears upon them; and therefore Moses might well afford
to pass by the affront they put upon him. Instead of chiding them, he
comforts them, and with an admirable presence and composure of mind, not
disheartened either by the threatenings of Egypt or the tremblings of
Israel, stills their murmuring, with the assurance of a speedy and
complete deliverance: Fear you not. Note, It is our duty and interest,
when we cannot get out of our troubles, yet to get above our fears, so
that they may only serve to quicken our prayers and endeavours, but may
not prevail to silence our faith and hope. 1. He assures them that God
would deliver them, that he would undertake their deliverance, and that
he would effect it in the utter ruin of their pursuers: The Lord shall
fight for you. This Moses was confident of himself, and would have them
to be so, though as yet he knew not how or which way it would be brought
to pass. God had assured him that Pharaoh and his host should be ruined,
and he comforts them with the same comforts wherewith he had been
comforted. 2. He directs them to leave it to God, in a silent
expectation of the event: "Stand still, and think not to save yourselves
either by fighting or flying; wait God's orders, and observe them; be
not contriving what course to take, but follow your leader; wait God's
appearances, and take notice of them, that you may see how foolish you
are to distrust them. Compose yourselves, by an entire confidence in
God, into a peaceful prospect of the great salvation God is now about to
work for you. Hold your peace; you need not so much as give a shout
against the enemy, as [Jos 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#016.md). The
work shall be done without any concurrence of yours." Note, (1.) If God
himself bring his people into straits, he will himself discover a way to
bring them out again. (2.) In times of great difficulty and great
expectation, it is our wisdom to keep our spirits calm, quiet, and
sedate; for then we are in the best frame both to do our own work and to
consider the work of God. Your strength is to sit still ([Isa
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#007).md), for the Egyptians shall help in
vain, and threaten to hurt in vain.

[Exodus 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 14:15</span></span>

We have here,

I. Direction given to Israel's leader.

1\. What he must do himself. He must, for the present, leave off
praying, and apply himself to his business ([Exo
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#015).md): Wherefore cryest thou unto me?
Moses, though he was assured of a good issue to the present distress,
yet did not neglect prayer. We read not of one word he said in prayer,
but he lifted up to God his heart, the language of which God well
understood and took notice of. Moses's silent prayers of faith prevailed
more with God than Israel's loud outcries of fear, [Exo
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#010). Note, (1..md) Praying, if of the
right kind, is crying to God, which denotes it to be the language both
of a natural and of an importunate desire. (2.) To quicken his
diligence. Moses had something else to do besides praying; he was to
command the hosts of Israel, and it was now requisite that he should be
at his post. Every thing is beautiful in its season.

2\. What he must order Israel to do. Speak to them, that they go
forward. Some think that Moses had prayed, not so much for their
deliverance (he was assured of that) as for the pardon of heir
murmurings, and that God's ordering them to go forward was an intimation
of the pardon. There is no going forward with any comfort but in the
sense of our reconciliation to God. Moses had bidden them stand still,
and expect orders from God; and now orders are given. They thought they
must have been directed either to the right hand or to the left. "No,"
says God, "speak to them to go forward, directly to the sea-side;" as if
there had lain a fleet of transport-ships ready for them to embark in.
Note, When we are in the way of our duty, though we met with
difficulties, we must go forward, and not stand in mute astonishment; we
must mind present work and then leave the even to God, use means and
trust him with the issue.

3\. What he might expect God to do. Let the children of Israel go as far
as they can upon dry ground, and then God will divide the sea, and open
a passage for them through it, [Exo
14:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#016.md). God designs, not only to
deliver the Israelites, but to destroy the Egyptians; and the plan of
his counsels is accordingly. (1.) He will show favour to Israel; the
waters shall be divided for them to pass through, [Exo
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#016.md). The same power could have
congealed the waters for them to pass over; but Infinite Wisdom chose
rather to divide the waters for them to pass through; for that way of
salvation is always pitched upon which is most humbling. Thus it is
said, with reference to this ([Isa
63:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#013.md), [Isa
63:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#014).md), He led them through the deep,
as a beast goes down into the valley, and thus made himself a glorious
name. (2.) He will get him honour upon Pharaoh. If the due rent of
honour be not paid to the great landlord, by and from whom we have and
hold our beings and comforts, he will distrain for it, and recover it.
God will be a loser by no man. In order to this, it is threatened: I,
behold I, will harden Pharaoh's heart, [Exo
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#017.md). The manner of expression is
observable: I, behold I, will do it. "I, that may do it;" so it is the
language of his sovereignty. We may not contribute to the hardening of
any man's heart, nor withhold any thing that we can do towards the
softening of it; but God's grace is his own, he hath mercy on whom he
will have mercy, and whom he will be hardeneth. "I, that can do it;" so
it is the language of his power; none but the Almighty can make the
heart soft ([Job 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#016).md), nor can any
other being make it hard. "I, that will do it;" for it is the language
of his justice; it is a righteous thing with God to put those under the
impressions of his wrath who have long resisted the influences of his
grace. It is spoken in a way of triumph over this obstinate and
presumptuous rebel: "I even I, will take an effectual course to humble
him; he shall break that would not bend." It is an expression like that
([Isa 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024).md), Ah, I will ease me of my
adversaries.

II\. A guard set upon Israel's camp where it now lay most exposed, which
was in the rear, [Exo 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#019.md), [Exo
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#020.md). The angel of God, whose
ministry was made use of in the pillar of cloud and fire, went from
before the camp of Israel, where they did not now need a guide (there
was no danger of missing their way through the sea, nor needed they any
other word of command than to go forward), and it came behind them,
where now they needed a guard (the Egyptians being just ready to seize
the hindmost of them), and so was a wall of partition between them.
There it was of use to the Israelites, not only to protect them, but to
light them through the sea, and, at the same time, it confounded the
Egyptians, so that they lost sight of their prey just when they were
ready to lay hands on it. The word and providence of God have a black
and dark side towards sin and sinners, but a bright and pleasant side
towards those that are Israelites indeed. That which is a savour of life
unto life to some is a savour of death unto death to others. This was
not the first time that he who in the beginning divided between light
and darkness ([Gen 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#004).md), and still
forms both ([Isa 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#007).md), had, at the
same time, allotted darkness to the Egyptians and light to the
Israelites, a specimen of the endless distinction which will be made
between the inheritance of the saints in light and that utter darkness
which for ever will be the portion of hypocrites. God will separate
between the precious and the vile.

[Exodus 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 14:21</span></span>

We have here the history of that work of wonder which is so often
mentioned both in the Old and New Testament, the dividing of the Red Sea
before the children of Israel. It was the terror of the Canaanites ([Jos
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#009.md), [Jos
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#010).md), the praise and triumph of the
Israelites, [Psa 114:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#003.md); [Psa
106:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#009.md); [Psa
136:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#013.md), [Psa
136:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#014.md). It was a type of baptism, [Co1
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001.md), [Co1
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#002.md). Israel's passage through it was
typical of the conversion of souls ([Isa
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015).md), and the Egyptians' perdition
in it was typical of the final ruin of all impenitent sinners, [Rev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#014.md). Here we have,

I. An instance of God's almighty power in the kingdom of nature, in
dividing the sea, and opening a passage through the waters. It was a
bay, or gulf, or arm of the sea, two or three leagues over, which was
divided, [Exo 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021.md). The instituted
sign made use of was Moses's stretching out his hand over it, to signify
that it was done in answer to his prayer, for the confirmation of his
mission, and in favour to the people whom he led. The natural sign was a
strong east wind, signifying that it was done by the power of God, whom
the winds and the seas obey. If there be any passage in the book of Job
which has reference to the miracles wrought for Israel's deliverance out
of Egypt, it is that in [Job 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#012.md), He
divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smileth
through Rahab (so the word is), that is, Egypt. Note, God can bring his
people through the greatest difficulties, and force a way where he does
not find it. The God of nature has not tied himself to its laws, but,
when he pleases, dispenses with them, and then the fire does not burn,
nor the water flow.

II\. An instance of his wonderful favour to his Israel. They went
through the sea to the opposite shore, for I cannot suppose, with some,
that they fetched a compass, and came out again on the same side, [Exo
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#022.md). They walked upon dry land in
the midst of the sea, [Exo 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#029.md). And
the pillar of cloud, that glory of the Lord, being their rearward ([Isa
58:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#008).md), that the Egyptians might not
charge them in the flank, the waters were a wall to them (it is twice
mentioned) on their right hand and on their left. Moses and Aaron, it is
probable, ventured first into this untrodden path, and then all Israel
after them; and this march through the paths of the great waters would
make their march afterwards, through the wilderness, less formidable.
Those who had followed God through the sea needed not to fear following
him whithersoever he led them. This march through the sea was in the
night, and not a moon-shiny night, for it was seven days after the full
moon, so that they had no light but what they had from the pillar of
cloud and fire. This made it the more awful; but where God leads us he
will light us; while we follow his conduct, we shall not want his
comforts.

This was done, and recorded, in order to encourage God's people in all
ages to trust in him in the greatest straits. What cannot he do who did
this? What will not he do for those hat fear and love him who did this
for these murmuring unbelieving Israelis, who yet were beloved for their
fathers' sake, and for the sake of a remnant among them? We find the
saints, long afterwards, making themselves sharers in the triumphs of
this march ([Psa 66:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#006).md): They went
through the flood on foot; there did we rejoice in him: and see how this
work of wonder is improved, [Psa
77:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#011.md), [Psa
77:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#016.md), [Psa
77:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#019.md).

III\. An instance of his just and righteous wrath upon his and his
people's enemies, the Egyptians. Observe here, 1. How they were
infatuated. In the heat of their pursuit, they went after the Israelites
into the midst of the sea, [Exo 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#023.md).
"Why," thought they, "may not we venture where Israel did?" Once or
twice the magicians of Egypt had done what Moses did, with their
enchantments; Pharaoh remembered this, but forgot how they were
nonplussed at last. They were more advantageously provided with chariots
and horses, while the Israelites were on foot. Pharaoh had said, I know
not the Lord; and by this it appeared he did not, else he would not have
ventured thus. None so bold as those that are blind. Rage against Israel
made them thus daring and inconsiderate: they had long hardened their
own hearts; and now God hardened them to their ruin, and hid from their
eyes the things that belonged to their peace and safety. Surely in vain
is the net spread in the sight of any bird ([Pro
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#017).md); yet so blind where the
Egyptians that they hastened to the snare, [Pro
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#023.md). Note, The ruin of sinners is
brought on by their own presumption, which hurries them headlong into
the pit. They are self-destroyers. 2. How they were troubled and
perplexed, [Exo 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#024.md), [Exo
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#025.md). For some hours they marched
through the divided waters as safely and triumphantly as Israel did, not
doubting but, that, in a little time, they should gain their point. But,
in the morning watch, the Lord looked upon the host of the Egyptians,
and troubled them. Something or other they saw or heard from the pillar
of cloud and fire which put them into great consternation, and gave them
an apprehension of their ruin before it was brought upon them. Now it
appeared that the triumphing of the wicked is short, and that God has
ways to frighten sinners into despair, before he plunges them into
destruction. He cuts off the spirit of princes, and is terrible to the
kings of the earth. (1.) They had hectored and boasted as if the day
were their own; but now they were troubled and dismayed, struck with a
panic-fear. (2.) They had driven furiously; but now they drove heavily,
and found themselves plugged and embarrassed at every step; the way grew
deep, their hearts grew sad, their wheels dropped off, and the
axle-trees failed. Thus can God check the violence of those that are in
pursuit of his people. (3.) They had been flying upon the back of
Israel, as the hawk upon the trembling dove; but now they cried, Let us
flee from the face of Israel, which had become to them like a torch of
fire in a sheaf, [Zac 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#006.md). Israel has
now, all of a sudden, become as much a terror to them as they had been
to Israel. They might have let Israel alone and would not; now they
would flee from the face of Israel and cannot. Men will not be
convinced, till it is too late, that those who meddle with God's people
meddle to their own hurt; when the Lord shall come with ten thousands of
his saints, to execute judgment, the mighty men will in vain seek to
shelter themselves under rocks and mountains from the face of Israel and
Israel's King, [Rev 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#015.md). Compare with
this story, [Job 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#020.md), etc. 3. How
they were all drowned. As soon as ever the children of Israel had got
safely to the shore, Moses was ordered to stretch out his hand over the
sea, and thereby give a signal to the waters to close again, as before,
upon he word of command, they had opened to the right and the left, [Exo
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#029.md). He did so, and immediately the
waters returned to their place, and overwhelmed all the host of the
Egyptians, [Exo 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#027.md), [Exo
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#028.md). Pharaoh and his servants, who
had hardened one another in sin, now fell together, and not one escaped.
An ancient tradition says that Pharaoh's magicians, Jannes and Jambres,
perished with the rest, as Balaam with the Midianites whom he had
seduced, [Num 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008). And now, (1..md) God
avenged upon the Egyptians the blood of the firstborn whom they had
drowned: and the principal is repaid with interest, it is recompensed
double, full-grown Egyptians for newborn Israelites; thus the Lord is
righteous, and precious is his people's blood in his sight, [Psa
72:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#014). (2..md) God reckoned with Pharaoh
for all his proud and insolent conduct towards Moses his ambassador.
Mocking the messengers of the Lord, and playing the fool with them,
bring ruin without remedy. Now God got him honour upon Pharaoh, looking
upon that proud man, and abasing him, [Job
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#012.md). Come and see the desolations he
made, and write it, not in water, but with an iron pen in the rock for
ever. Here lies that bloody tyrant who bade defiance to his Maker, to
his demands, threatenings, and judgments; a rebel to God, and a slave to
his own barbarous passions; perfectly lost to humanity, virtue, and all
true honour; here he lies, buried in the deep, a perpetual monument of
divine justice. Here he went down to the pit, though he was the terror
of the mighty in the land of the living. This is Pharaoh and all his
multitude, [Eze 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#018.md).

IV\. Here is the notice which the Israelites took of this wonderful work
which God wrought for them, and the good impressions which it made upon
them for the present.

1\. They saw the Egyptians dead upon the sands, [Exo
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#030.md). Providence so ordered it that
the next tide threw up the dead bodies, (1.) For the greater disgrace of
the Egyptians. Now the beasts and birds of prey were called to eat the
flesh of the captains and mighty men, [Rev
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017.md), [Rev
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#018.md). The Egyptians were very nice
and curious in embalming and preserving the bodies of their great men,
but here the utmost contempt is poured upon all the grandees of Egypt;
see how they lie, heaps upon heaps, as dung upon the face of the earth.
(2.) For the greater triumph of the Israelites, and to affect them the
more with their deliverance; for the eye affects the heart. See [Isa
66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024.md), They shall go forth, and look
upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me. Probably
they stripped the slain and, having borrowed jewels of their neighbours
before, which (the Egyptians having by this hostile pursuit of them
broken their faith with them) henceforward they were not under any
obligation to restore, they now got arms from them, which, some think,
they were not before provided with. Thus, when God broke the heads of
Leviathan in pieces, he gave him to be meat to the people inhabiting the
wilderness, [Psa 74:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#014.md).

2\. The sight of this great work greatly affected them, and now they
feared the Lord, and believed the Lord, and his servant Moses, [Exo
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#031.md). Now they were ashamed of their
distrusts and murmurings, and, in the good mind they were in, they would
never again despair of help from Heaven, no, not in the greatest
straits; they would never again quarrel with Moses, nor talk of
returning to Egypt. They were now baptized unto Moses in the sea, [Co1
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#002.md). This great work which God
wrought for them by the ministry of Moses bound them effectually to
follow his directions, under God. This confirmed their faith in the
promises that were yet to be fulfilled; and, being brought thus
triumphantly out of Egypt, they did not doubt that they should be in
Canaan shortly, having such a God to trust to, and such a mediator
between them and him. O that there had been such a heart in them as now
there seemed to be! Sensible mercies, when they are fresh, make sensible
impressions; but with many these impressions soon wear off: while they
see God's works, and feel the benefit of them, they fear him and trust
in him; but they soon forget his works, and then they slight him. How
well were it for us if we were always in as good a frame as we are in
sometimes!
