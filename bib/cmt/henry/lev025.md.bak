### [Leviticus Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 25:0</span></span>

The law of this chapter concerns the lands and estates of the Israelites
in Canaan, the occupying and transferring of which were to be under the
divine direction, as well as the management of religious worship; for,
as the tabernacle was a holy house, so Canaan was a holy land; and upon
that account, as much as any thing, it was the glory of all lands. In
token of a peculiar title which God had to this land, and a right to
dispose of it, he appointed, I. That every seventh year should be a year
of rest from occupying the land, a sabbatical year ([Lev
25:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#001).md). In this God expected from
them extraordinary instances of faith and obedience, and they might
expect from God extraordinary instances of power and goodness in
providing for them ([Lev 25:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#018).md).
II. That every fiftieth year should be a year of jubilee, that is, 1. A
year of release of debts and mortgages, and return to the possession of
their alienated lands ([Lev 25:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#008).md).
Particular directions are given, (1.) Concerning the sale and redemption
of lands ([Lev 25:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#023)). (2..md) Of
houses in cities and villages, with a proviso for Levite-cities ([Lev
25:29-34](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#029).md). 2. A year of release of
servants and bond-slaves. (1.) Here is inserted a law for the kind usage
of poor debtors ([Lev 25:35-38](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#035)). (2.md).
Then comes the law for the discharge of all Israelites that were sold
for servants, in the year of jubilee, if they were not redeemed before.
\[1.\] If they were sold to Israelites ([Lev
25:39-46](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#039).md). And, \[2.\] If sold to
proselytes ([Lev 25:47-55](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#047).md). All these
appointments have something moral and of perpetual obligation in them,
though in the letter of them they were not only peculiar to the Jews,
but to them only while they were in Canaan.

[Leviticus 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 25:1</span></span>

The law of Moses laid a great deal of stress upon the sabbath, the
sanctification of which was the earliest and most ancient of all divine
institutions, designed for the keeping up of the knowledge and worship
of the Creator among men; that law not only revived the observance of
the weekly sabbath, but, for the further advancement of the honour of
them, added the institution of a sabbatical year: In the seventh year
shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, [Lev
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#004.md). And hence the Jews collect that
vulgar tradition that after the world has stood six thousand years (a
thousand years being to God as one day) it shall cease, and the eternal
sabbath shall succeed - a weak foundation on which to build the fixing
of that day and hour which it is God's prerogative to know. This
sabbatical year began in September, at the end of harvest, the seventh
month of their ecclesiastical year: and the law was, 1. That at the
seed-time, which immediately followed the end of their in-gathering,
they should sow no corn in their land, and that they should not in the
spring dress their vineyards, and consequently that they should not
expect either harvest or vintage the next year. 2. That what their
ground did produce of itself they should not claim any property or use
in, otherwise than from hand to mouth, but leave it for the poor,
servants, strangers, and cattle, [Lev
25:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#005.md). It must be a sabbath of rest
to the land; they must neither do any work about it, nor expect any
fruit from it; all annual labours must be intermitted in the seventh
year, as much as daily labours on the seventh day. The Jews say they
"began not to reckon for the sabbatical year till they had completed the
conquest of Canaan, which was in the eighth year of Joshua; the seventh
year after that was the first sabbatical year, and so the fiftieth year
was the jubilee." This year there was to be a general release of debts
([Deu 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#001.md), [Deu
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#002).md), and a public reading of the law
in the feast ([Deu 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#010.md), [Deu
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#011).md), to make it the more solemn.
Now, (1.) God would hereby show them that he was their landlord, and
that they were tenants at will under him. Landlords are wont to
stipulate with their tenants when they shall break up their ground, how
long they shall till it, and when they shall let it rest: God would thus
give, grant, and convey, that good land to them, under such provisos and
limitations as should let them know that they were not proprietors, but
dependents on their Lord. (2.) It was a kindness to their land to let it
rest sometimes, and would keep it in heart (as our husbandmen express
it) for posterity, whose satisfaction God would have them to consult,
and not to use the ground as if it were designed only for one age. (3.)
When they were thus for a whole year taken off from all country
business, they would have the more leisure to attend the exercises of
religion, and to get the knowledge of God and his law. (4.) They were
hereby taught to be charitable and generous, and not to engross all to
themselves, but to be willing that others should share with them in the
gifts of God's bounty, which the earth brought forth of itself. (5.)
They were brought to live in a constant dependence upon the divine
providence, finding that, as man lives not by bread alone, so he has
bread, not by his own industry alone, but, if God pleases, by the word
of blessing from the mouth of God, without any care or pains of man,
[Mat 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#004). (6..md) They were reminded of
the easy life man lived in paradise, when he ate of every good thing,
not, as since, in the sweat of his face. Labour and toil came in with
sin. (7.) They were taught to consider how the poor lived, that did
neither sow nor reap, even by the blessing of God upon a little. (8.)
This year of rest typified the spiritual rest which all believers enter
into through Christ, our true Noah, who giveth us comfort and rest
concerning our work, and the toil of our hands, because of the ground
which the Lord hath cursed, [Gen 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#029.md).
Through him we are eased of the burden of worldly care and labour, both
being sanctified and sweetened to us, and we are enabled and encouraged
to live by faith. And, as the fruits of this sabbath of the land were
enjoyed in common, so the salvation wrought out by Christ is a common
salvation; and this sabbatical year seems to have been revived in the
Christian church, when the believers had all things common, [Act
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#044.md).

[Leviticus 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 25:8</span></span>

Here is, I. The general institution of the jubilee, [Lev
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#008.md). etc.

1\. When it was to be observed: after seven sabbaths of years ([Lev
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#008).md), whether the forty-ninth or
fiftieth is a great question among learned men: that it should be the
seventh sabbatical year, that is, the forty-ninth (which by a very
common form of speech is called the fiftieth), seems to me most
probable, and is, I think, made pretty clear and the objections removed
by that learned chronologer Calvisius; but this is not a place for
arguing the question. Seven sabbaths of weeks were reckoned from the
passover to the feast of pentecost (or fiftieth day, for so pentecost
signifies), and so seven sabbaths of years from one jubilee to another,
and the seventh is called the fiftieth; and all this honour is put upon
the sevenths for the sake of God's resting the seventh day from the work
of creation.

2\. How it was to be proclaimed, with sound of trumpet in all parts of
the country ([Lev 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#005).md), both to give
notice to all persons of it, and to express their joy and triumph in it;
and the word jobel, or jubilee, is supposed to signify some particular
sound of the trumpet distinguishable from any other; for the trumpet
that gives an uncertain sound is of little service, [Co1
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#008.md). The trumpet was sounded in the
close of the day of atonement; thence the jubilee commenced, and very
fitly; when they had been humbling and afflicting their souls for sin,
then they were made to hear this voice of joy and gladness, [Psa
51:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#008.md). When their peace was made with
God, then liberty was proclaimed; for the removal of guilt is necessary
to make way for the entrance of all true comfort, [Rom
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001.md), [Rom
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002.md). In allusion to this solemn
proclamation of the jubilee, it was foretold concerning our Lord Jesus
that he should preach the acceptable year of the Lord, [Isa
61:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002.md). He sent his apostles to proclaim
it with the trumpet of the everlasting gospel, which they were to preach
to every creature. And it stands still foretold that at the last day the
trumpet shall sound, which shall release the dead out of the bondage of
the grave, and restore us to our possessions.

3\. What was to be done in that year extraordinary; besides the common
rest of the land, which was observed every sabbatical year ([Lev
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#011.md), [Lev
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#012).md), and the release of personal
debts ([Deu 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#002.md), [Deu
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#003).md), there was to be the legal
restoration of every Israelite to all the property, and all the liberty,
which had been alienated from him since the last jubilee; so that never
was any people so secured in their liberty and property (those glories
of a people) as Israel was. Effectual care was taken that while they
kept close to God these should not only not be taken from them by the
violence of others, but not thrown away by their own folly.

(1.) The property which every man had in his dividend of the land of
Canaan could not be alienated any longer than till the year of jubilee,
and then he or his should return to it, and have a title to it as
undisputed, and the possession of it as undisturbed, as ever ([Lev
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#010.md), [Lev
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#013).md): "You shall return every man to
his possession; so that if a man had sold or mortgaged his estate, or
any part of it, it should then return to him or his heirs, free of all
charge and encumbrance. Now this was no wrong to the purchaser, because
the year of jubilee was fixed, and every man knew when it would come,
and made his bargain accordingly. By our law indeed, if lands be granted
to a man and his heirs, upon condition that he should never sell or
alienate them, the grant is good, but the condition is void and
repugnant: Iniquum est ingenuis hominibus (say the lawyers) non esse
liberam rerum suarum alienationem - It is unjust to prevent free men
from alienating their own possessions. Yet it is agreed in the books
that if the king grant lands to a man in fee upon condition he shall not
alienate, the condition is good. Now God would show his people Israel
that their land was his, and they were his tenants; and therefore he
ties them up that they shall not have power to sell, but only to make
leases for any term of years, not going beyond the next jubilee. By this
means it was provided, \[1.\] That their genealogies should be carefully
preserved, which would be of use for clearing our Saviour's pedigree.
\[2.\] That the distinction of tribes should be kept up; for, though a
man might purchase lands in another tribe, yet he could not retain them
longer than till the year of jubilee, and then they would revert of
course. \[3.\] That none should grow exorbitantly rich, by laying house
to house, and field to field ([Isa
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008).md), but should rather apply
themselves to the cultivating of what they had than the enlarging of
their possessions. The wisdom of the Roman commonwealth sometimes
provided that no man should be master of above 500 acres. \[4.\] That no
family should be sunk and ruined, and condemned to perpetual poverty.
This particular care God took for the support of the honour of that
people, and the preserving, not only of that good land to the nation in
general, but of every man's share to his family in particular, for a
perpetual inheritance, that it might the better typify that good part
which shall never be taken away from those that have it.

(2.) The liberty which every man was born to, if it were sold or
forfeited, should likewise return at the year of jubilee: You shall
return every man to his family, [Lev
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#010.md). Those that were sold into other
families thereby became strangers to their own; but in this year of
redemption they were to return. This was typical of our redemption by
Christ from the slavery of sin and Satan, and our restoration to the
glorious liberty of the children of God. Some compute that the very year
in which Christ died was a year of jubilee, and the last that ever was
kept. But, however that be, we are sure it is the Son that makes us
free, and then we are free indeed.

II\. A law upon this occasion against oppression in buying and selling
of land; neither the buyer nor the seller must overreach, [Lev
25:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#014.md). In short, the buyer must not
give less, nor the seller take more, than the just value of the thing,
considered as necessarily returning at the year of jubilee. It must be
settled what the clear yearly value of the land was, and then how many
years' purchase it was worth till the year of jubilee. But they must
reckon only the years of the fruits ([Lev
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#015).md), and therefore must discount
for the sabbatical years. It is easy to observe that the nearer the
jubilee was the less must the value of the land be. According to the
fewness of the years thou shalt diminish the price. But we do not find
it so easy practically to infer thence that the nearer the world comes
to its period the less value we should put upon the things of it:
because the time is short, and the fashion of the world passeth away,
let those that buy be as though they possessed not. One would put little
value on an old house, that is ready to drop down. All bargains ought to
be made by this rule, You shall not oppress one another, nor take
advantage of one another's ignorance or necessity, but thou shalt fear
thy God. Note, The fear of God reigning in the heart would effectually
restrain us from doing any wrong to our neighbour in word or deed; for,
though man be not, God is the avenger of those that go beyond or defraud
their brethren, [Th1 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#006.md). Perhaps
Nehemiah refers to this very law ([Neh
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#015).md), where he tells us that he did
not oppress those he had under his power, because of the fear of God.

III\. Assurance given them that they should be no losers, but great
gainers, by observing these years of rest. It is promised, 1. That they
should be safe: You shall dwell in the land in safety, [Lev
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#018.md). and again, [Lev
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#019.md). The word signifies both outward
safety and inward security and confidence of spirit, that they should be
quiet both from evil and from the fear of evil. 2. That they should be
rich: You shall eat your fill. Note, If we be careful to do our duty, we
may cheerfully trust God with our comfort. 3. That they should not want
food convenient that year in which they did neither sow nor reap: I will
command my blessing in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit
for three years, [Lev 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#021.md). This was,
(1.) A standing miracle, that, whereas at other times one year did but
serve to bring in another, the productions of the sixth year should
serve to bring in the ninth. Note, The blessing of God upon our
provision will make a little go a great way, and satisfy even the poor
with bread, [Psa 132:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#015). (2..md) A
lasting memorial of the manna which was given double on the sixth day
for two days. (3.) It was intended for an encouragement to all God's
people, in all ages, to trust him in the way of duty, and to cast their
care upon him. There is nothing lost by faith and self-denial in our
obedience.

[Leviticus 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 25:23</span></span>

Here is, I. A law concerning the real estates of the Israelites in the
land of Canaan, and the transferring of them. 1. No land should be sold
for ever from the family to whose lot it fell in the division of the
land. And the reason given is, The land is mine, and you are strangers
and sojourners with me, [Lev 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#023.md).
(1.) God having a particular propriety in this land, he would by this
restraint keep them sensible of it. The possessions of good people, who,
having given up themselves to God, have therewith given up all they have
to him, are in a particular manner at his disposal, and his disposal of
them must be submitted to. (2.) They being strangers and sojourners with
him in that land, and having his tabernacle among them, to alienate
their part of that land would be in effect to cut themselves off from
their fellowship and communion with God, of which that was a token and
symbol, for which reason Naboth would rather incur the wrath of a king
than part with the inheritance of his fathers, [Kg1
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#003.md). 2. If a man was constrained
through poverty to sell his land for the subsistence of his family, yet,
if afterwards he was able, he might redeem it before the year of jubilee
([Lev 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#024.md), [Lev
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#026.md), [Lev
25:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#027).md), and the price must be settled
according to the number of years since the sale and before the jubilee.
3. If the person himself was not able to redeem it, his next kinsman
might ([Lev 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#025).md): The redeemer
thereof, he that is near unto him, shall come and shall redeem, so it
might be read. The kinsman is called Goel, the redeemer ([Num
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#008.md); [Rut
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#009).md), to whom belonged the right of
redeeming the land. And this typified Christ, who assumed our nature,
that he might be our kinsman, bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh,
and, being the only kinsman we have that is able to do it, to him
belonged the right of redemption. As for all our other kinsmen, their
shoe must be plucked off ([Rut 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#006.md),
[Rut 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#007).md); they cannot redeem. But
Christ can and hath redeemed the inheritance which we by sin had
forfeited and alienated, and made a new settlement of it upon all that
by faith become allied to him. We know that this Redeemer liveth, [Job
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025.md). And some make this duty of the
kinsman to signify the brotherly love that should be among Christians,
inclining them to recover those that are fallen, and to restore them
with the spirit of meekness. 4. If the land was not redeemed before the
year of jubilee, then it should return of course to him that had sold or
mortgaged it: In the jubilee it shall go out, [Lev
25:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#028.md). This was a figure of the free
grace of God towards us in Christ, by which, and not by any price or
merit of our own, we are restored to the favour of God, and become
entitled to paradise, from which our first parents, and we in them, were
expelled for disobedience. 5. A difference was made between houses in
walled cities, and lands in the country, or houses in country villages.
Houses in walled cities were more the fruits of their own industry than
land in the country, which was the immediate gift of God's bounty; and
therefore, if a man sold a house in a city, he might redeem it any time
within a year after the sale, but otherwise it was confirmed to the
purchaser for ever, and should not return, no, not at the year of the
jubilee, [Lev 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#029.md), [Lev
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#030.md). This provision was made to
encourage strangers and proselytes to come and settle among them. Though
they could not purchase land in Canaan to them and their heirs, yet they
might purchase houses in walled cities, which would be most convenient
for those who were supposed to live by trade. But country houses could
be disposed of no otherwise than as lands might. 6. A clause is added in
favour of the Levites, by way of exception from these rules. (1.)
Dwelling houses in the cities of the Levites might be redeemed at any
time, and, if not redeemed, should revert in the year of jubilee ([Lev
25:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#032.md), [Lev
25:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#033).md), because the Levites had no
other possessions than cities and their suburbs, and God would show that
the Levites were his peculiar care; and it was for the interest of the
public that they should not be impoverished, or wormed out of their
inheritances. (2.) The fields adjoining to their cities ([Num
35:4](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#004.md), [Num
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#005).md) might not be sold at any time,
for they belonged, not to particular Levites, but to the city of the
Levites, as a corporation, who could not alienate without a wrong to
their tribe; therefore, if any of those fields were sold, the bargain
was void, [Lev 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#034.md). Even the
Egyptians took care to preserve the land of the priests, [Gen
47:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#022.md). And there is no less reason for
the taking of the maintenance of the gospel ministry under the special
protection of Christian governments.

II\. A law for the relief of the poor, and the tender usage of poor
debtors, and these are of more general and perpetual obligation than the
former.

1\. The poor must be relieved, [Lev
25:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#035). Here is, (1..md) Our brother's
poverty and distress supposed: If thy brother be waxen poor; not only
thy brother by nation as a Jew, but thy brother by nature as a man, for
it follows, though he be a stranger or a sojourner. All men are to be
looked upon and treated as brethren, for we have all one Father, [Mal
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#010.md). Though he is poor, yet still he
is thy brother, and is to be loved and owned as a brother. Poverty does
not destroy the relation. Though a son of Abraham, yet he may wax poor
and fall into decay. Note, Poverty and decay are great grievances, and
very common: The poor you have always with you. (2.) Our duty enjoined:
Thou shalt relieve him. By sympathy, pitying the poor; by service, doing
for them; and by supply, giving to them according to their necessity and
thy ability.

2\. Poor debtors must not be oppressed: If thy brother be waxen poor,
and have occasion to borrow money of thee for the necessary support of
his family, take thou no usury of him, either for money or victuals,
[Lev 25:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#036.md), [Lev
25:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#037.md). And thus far this law binds
still, but could never be thought binding where money is borrowed for
purchase of lands, trade, or other improvements; for there it is
reasonable that the lender share with the borrower in the profit. The
law here is plainly intended for the relief of the poor, to whom it is
sometimes as great a charity to lend freely as to give. Observe the
arguments here used against extortion. (1.) God patronizes the poor:
"Fear thy God, who will reckon with thee for all injuries done to the
poor: thou fearest not them, but fear him." (2.) Relieve the poor, that
they may live with thee, and some way or other they may be serviceable
to thee. The rich can as ill spare the hands of the poor as the poor can
the purses of the rich. (3.) The same argument is used to enforce this
precept that prefaces all the ten commandments: I am the Lord your God
which brought you out of Egypt, [Lev
25:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#038.md). Note, It becomes those that
have received mercy to show mercy. If God has been gracious to us, we
ought not to be rigorous with our brethren.

[Leviticus 25:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">lev 25:39</span></span>

We have here the laws concerning servitude, designed to preserve the
honour of the Jewish nation as a free people, and rescued by a divine
power out of the house of bondage, into the glorious liberty of God's
sons, his first-born. Now the law is,

I. That a native Israelite should never be made a bondman for
perpetuity. If he was sold for debt, or for a crime, by the house of
judgment, he was to serve but six years, and to go out the seventh; this
was appointed, [Exo 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#002.md). But if he
sold himself through extreme poverty, having nothing at all left him to
preserve his life, and if it was to one of his own nation that he sold
himself, in such a case it is here provided, 1. That he should not serve
as a bond-servant ([Lev 25:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#039).md), nor be
sold with the sale of a bondman ([Lev
25:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#042).md); that is, "it must not be
looked upon that his master that bought him had as absolute a property
in him as in a captive taken in war, that might be used, sold, and
bequeathed, at pleasure, as much as a man's cattle; no, he shall serve
thee as a hired servant, whom the master has the use of only, but not a
despotic power over." And the reason is, They are my servants, [Lev
25:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#042.md). God does not make his servants
slaves, and therefore their brethren must not. God had redeemed them out
of Egypt, and therefore they must never be exposed to sale as bondmen.
The apostle applies this spiritually ([Co1
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#023).md), You are bought with a price, be
not the servants of men, that is, "of the lusts of men, no, nor of your
own lusts;" for, having become the servants of God, we must not let sin
reign in our mortal bodies, [Rom 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#012.md),
[Rom 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#022.md). 2. That while he did serve
he should not be ruled with rigour, as the Israelites were in Egypt,
[Lev 25:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#043.md). Both his work and his
usage must be such as were fitting for a son of Abraham. Masters are
still required to give to their servants that which is just and equal,
[Col 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#001.md). They may be used, but must
not be abused. Those masters that are always hectoring and domineering
over their servants, taunting them and trampling upon them, that are
unreasonable in exacting work and giving rebukes, and that rule them
with a high hand, forget that their Master is in heaven; and what will
they do when he rises up? as holy Job reasons with himself, [Job
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#013.md), [Job
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#014.md). 3. That at the year of jubilee
he should go out free, he and his children, and should return to his own
family, [Lev 25:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#041.md). This typified our
redemption from the service of sin and Satan by the grace of God in
Christ, whose truth makes us free, [Joh
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#032.md). The Jewish writers say that, for
ten days before the jubilee-trumpet sounded, the servants that were to
be discharged by it did express their great joy by feasting, and wearing
garlands on their heads: it is therefore called the joyful sound, [Psa
89:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#015.md). And we are thus to rejoice in
the liberty we have by Christ.

II\. That they might purchase bondmen of the heathen nations that were
round about them, or of those strangers that sojourned among them
(except of those seven nations that were to be destroyed); and might
claim a dominion over them, and entail them upon their families as an
inheritance, for the year of jubilee should give no discharge to them,
[Lev 25:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#044.md), [Lev
25:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#046.md). Thus in our English plantations
the negroes only are used as slaves; how much to the credit of
Christianity I shall not say. Now, 1. This authority which they had over
the bondmen whom they purchased from the neighbouring nations was in
pursuance of the blessing of Jacob, [Gen
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#029.md), Let people serve thee. 2. It
prefigured the bringing in of the Gentiles to the service of Christ and
his church. Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thy
inheritance, [Psa 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008.md). And it is
promised ([Isa 61:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#005).md), Strangers shall
stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your
vine-dressers; see [Rev 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#026.md), [Rev
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027.md). The upright shall have the
dominion in the morning, [Psa 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014.md).
3. It intimates that none shall have the benefit of the gospel jubilee
but those only that are Israelites indeed, and the children of Abraham
by faith: as for those that continue heathenish, they continue bondmen.
See this turned upon the unbelieving Jews themselves, [Gal
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#025.md), where Jerusalem, when she had
rejected Christ, is said to be in bondage with her children. Let me only
add here that, though they are not forbidden to rule their bondmen with
rigour, yet the Jewish doctors say, "It is the property of mercy, and
way of wisdom, that a man should be compassionate, and not make his yoke
heavy upon any servant that he has."

III\. That if an Israelite sold himself for a servant to a wealthy
proselyte that sojourned among them care should be taken that he should
have the same advantages as if he had sold himself to an Israelite, and
in some respects greater. 1. That he should not serve as a bondman, but
as a hired servant, and not to be ruled with rigour ([Lev
25:53](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#053).md), in thy sight, which intimated
that the Jewish magistrates should particularly have an eye to him, and,
if he were abused, should take cognizance of it, and redress his
grievances, though the injured servant did not himself complain. Also he
was to go free at the year of jubilee, [Lev
25:54](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#054.md). Though the sons of strangers
might serve them for ever, yet the sons of Israel might not serve
strangers for ever; yet the servant here, having made himself a slave by
his own act and deed, should not go out in the seventh year of release,
but in the jubilee only. 2. That he should have this further advantage
that he might be redeemed again before the year of jubilee, [Lev
25:48](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#048.md), [Lev
25:49](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#049.md). He that had sold himself to an
Israelite might, if ever he was able, redeem himself, but his relations
had no right to redeem him. "But if a man sold himself to a stranger,"
the Jews say, "his relations were urged to redeem him; if they did not,
it was fit that he should be redeemed at the public charge," which we
find done, [Neh 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#008.md). The price of his
ransom was to be computed according to the prospect of the year of
jubilee ([Lev 25:50-52](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#050).md), as in the
redemption of land, [Lev 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#015.md), [Lev
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#016.md). The learned bishop Patrick
quotes one of the Jewish rabbin for an evangelical exposition of that
appointment ([Lev 25:48](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#048).md), One of his
brethren shall redeem him. "This Redeemer," says the rabbi, "is the
Messiah, the Son of David." They expected this Messiah to be their
Redeemer out of their captivity, and to restore them to their own land
again; but we welcome him as the Redeemer who shall come to Zion, and
shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob, for he shall save his people
from their sins; and under this notion there were those that looked for
redemption in Jerusalem.
