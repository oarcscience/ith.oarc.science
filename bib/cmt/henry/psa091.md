### [Psalms Chapter 91](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 91:0</span></span>

Some of the ancients were of opinion that Moses was the penman, not only
of the foregoing psalm, which is expressly said to be his, but also of
the eight that next follow it; but that cannot be, for [Psa
95:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001.md) is expressly said to be penned
by David, and long after Moses, [Heb
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#007.md). It is probable that this psalm
also was penned by David; it is a writ of protection for all true
believers, not in the name of king David, or under his broad seal; he
needed it himself, especially if the psalm was penned, as some
conjecture it was, at the time of the pestilence which was sent for his
numbering the people; but in the name of the King of kings, and under
the broad seal of Heaven. Observe, I. The psalmist's own resolution to
take God for his keeper ([Psa 91:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#002).md),
from which he gives both direction and encouragement to others ([Psa
91:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#009).md). II. The promises which are here
made, in God's name, to all those that do so in sincerity. 1. They shall
be taken under the peculiar care of Heaven ([Psa
91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md), [Psa
91:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#004).md). 2. They shall be delivered from
the malice of the powers of darkness ([Psa
91:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#003.md), [Psa
91:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#005.md), [Psa
91:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#006).md), and that by a distinguishing
preservation ([Psa 91:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#007.md), [Psa
91:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#008).md). 3. They shall be the charge of
the holy angels ([Psa 91:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#010).md). 4.
They shall triumph over their enemies ([Psa
91:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#013).md). 5. They shall be the special
favourites of God himself ([Psa
91:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#014).md). In singing this we must
shelter ourselves under, and then solace ourselves in, the divine
protection. Many think that to Christ, as Mediator, these promises do
primarily belong ([Isa 49:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#002).md), not
because to him the devil applied one of these promises ([Mat
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#006).md), but because to him they are very
applicable, and, coming through him, they are more sweet and sure to all
believers.

[Psalms 91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 91:1</span></span>

In these verses we have,

I. A great truth laid down in general, That all those who live a life of
communion with God are constantly safe under his protection, and may
therefore preserve a holy serenity and security of mind at all times
([Psa 91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001).md): He that dwells, that sits
down, in the secret place of the Most High, shall abide under the shadow
of the Almighty; he that by faith chooses God for his guardian shall
find all that in him which he needs or can desire. Note, 1. It is the
character of a true believer that he dwells in the secret place of the
Most High; he is at home in God, returns to God, and reposes in him as
his rest; he acquaints himself with inward religion, and makes
heart-work of the service of God, worships within the veil, and loves to
be alone with God, to converse with him in solitude. 2. It is the
privilege and comfort of those that do so that they abide under the
shadow of the Almighty; he shelters them, and comes between them and
every thing that would annoy them, whether storm or sunshine. They shall
not only have an admittance, but a residence, under God's protection; he
will be their rest and refuge for ever.

II\. The psalmist's comfortable application of this to himself ([Psa
91:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#002).md): I will say of the Lord,
whatever others say of him, "He is my refuge; I choose him as such, and
confide in him. Others make idols their refuge, but I will say of
Jehovah, the true and living God, He is my refuge: any other is a refuge
of lies. He is a refuge that will not fail me; for he is my fortress and
strong-hold." Idolaters called their idols Mahuzzim, their most
strong-hold ([Dan 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#039).md), but therein
they deceived themselves; those only secure themselves that make the
Lord their God, their fortress. There being no reason to question his
sufficiency, fitly does it follow, In him will I trust. If Jehovah be
our God, our refuge, and our fortress, what can we desire which we may
not be sure to find in him? He is neither fickle nor false, neither weak
nor mortal; he is God and not man, and therefore there is no danger of
being disappointed in him. We know whom we have trusted.

III\. The great encouragement he gives to others to do likewise, not
only from his own experience of the comfort of it (for in that there
might possibly be a fallacy), but from the truth of God's promise, in
which there neither is nor can be any deceit ([Psa
91:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#003.md), [Psa
91:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#004), etc..md): Surely he shall deliver
thee. Those who have themselves found the comfort of making God their
refuge cannot but desire that others may do so. Now here it is promised,

1\. That believers shall be kept from those mischiefs which they are in
imminent danger of, and which would be fatal to them ([Psa
91:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#003).md), from the snare of the fowler,
which is laid unseen and catches the unwary prey on a sudden, and from
the noisome pestilence, which seizes men unawares and against which
there is no guard. This promise protects, (1.) The natural life, and is
often fulfilled in our preservation from those dangers which are very
threatening and very near, while yet we ourselves are not apprehensive
of them, any more than the bird is of the snare of the fowler. We owe
it, more than we are sensible, to the care of the divine Providence that
we have been kept from infectious diseases and out of the hands of the
wicked and unreasonable. (2.) The spiritual life, which is protected by
divine grace from the temptations of Satan, which are as the snares of
the fowler, and from the contagion of sin, which is the noisome
pestilence. He that has given grace to be the glory of the soul will
create a defence upon all that glory.

2\. That God himself will be their protector; those must needs be safe
who have him for their keeper, and successful for whom he undertakes
([Psa 91:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#004).md): He shall cover thee,
shall keep thee secret ([Psa 31:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#020).md),
and so keep thee safe, [Psa 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005.md). God
protects believers, (1.) With the greatest tenderness and affection,
which is intimated in that, He shall cover thee with his feathers, under
his wings, which alludes to the hen gathering her chickens under wings,
[Mat 23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md). By natural instinct she
not only protects them, but calls them under that protection when she
sees them in danger, not only keeps them safe, but cherishes them and
keeps them warm. To this the great God is pleased to compare his care of
his people, who are helpless as the chickens, and easily made a prey of,
but are invited to trust under the shadow of the wings of the divine
promise and providence, which is the periphrasis of a proselyte to the
true religion, that he has come to trust under the wings of the God of
Israel, [Rut 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#012). (2..md) With the
greatest power and efficacy. Wings and feathers, though spread with the
greatest tenderness, are yet weak, and easily broken through, and
therefore it is added, His truth shall be thy shield and buckler, a
strong defence. God is willing to guard his people as the hen is to
guard the chickens, and as able as a man of war in armour.

3\. That he will not only keep them from evil, but from the fear of
evil, [Psa 91:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#005.md), [Psa
91:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#006). Here is, (1..md) Great danger
supposed; the mention of it is enough to frighten us; night and day we
lie exposed, and those that are apt to be timorous will in neither
period think themselves safe. When we are retired into our chambers, our
beds, and have made all as safe as we can about us, yet there is terror
by night, from thieves and robbers, winds and storms, besides those
things that are the creatures of fancy and imagination, which are often
most frightful of all. We read of fear in the night, [Sol
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#008.md). There is also a pestilence that
walketh in darkness, as that was which slew the first-born of the
Egyptians, and the army of the Assyrians. No locks nor bars can shut out
diseases, while we carry about with us in our bodies the seeds of them.
But surely in the day-time, when we can look about us, we are not so
much in danger; yes, there is an arrow that flieth by day too, and yet
flies unseen; there is a destruction that wasteth at high-noon, when we
are awake and have all our friends about us; even then we cannot secure
ourselves, nor can they secure us. It was in the day-time that that
pestilence wasted which was sent to chastise David for numbering the
people, on occasion of which some think this psalm was penned. But, (2.)
Here is great security promised to believers in the midst of this
danger: "Thou shalt not be afraid. God by his grace will keep thee from
disquieting distrustful fear (that fear which hath torment) in the midst
of the greatest dangers. Wisdom shall keep thee from being causelessly
afraid, and faith shall keep thee from being inordinately afraid. Thou
shalt not be afraid of the arrow, as knowing that though it may hit thee
it cannot hurt thee; if it take away the natural life, yet it shall be
so far from doing any prejudice to the spiritual life that it shall be
its perfection." A believer needs not fear, and therefore should not
fear, any arrow, because the point is off, the poison is out. O death!
where is thy sting? It is also under divine direction, and will hit
where God appoints and not otherwise. Every bullet has its commission.
Whatever is done our heavenly Father's will is done; and we have no
reason to be afraid of that.

4\. That they shall be preserved in common calamities, in a
distinguishing way ([Psa 91:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#007).md): "When
death rides in triumph, and diseases rage, so that thousands and ten
thousands fall, fall by sickness, or fall by the sword in battle, fall
at thy side, at thy right hand, and the sight of their fall is enough to
frighten thee, and if they fall by the pestilence their falling so near
thee may be likely to infect thee, yet it shall not come nigh thee, the
death shall not, the fear of death shall not." Those that preserve their
purity in times of general corruption may trust God with their safety in
times of general desolation. When multitudes die round about us, though
thereby we must be awakened to prepare for our own death, yet we must
not be afraid with any amazement, nor make ourselves subject to bondage,
as many do all their life-time, through fear of death, [Heb
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#015.md). The sprinkling of blood secured
the first-born of Israel when thousands fell. Nay, it is promised to
God's people that they shall have the satisfaction of seeing, not only
God's promises fulfilled to them, but his threatenings fulfilled upon
those that hate them ([Psa 91:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#008).md): Only
with thy eyes shalt thou behold and see the just reward of the wicked,
which perhaps refers to the destruction of the first-born of Egypt by
the pestilence, which was both the punishment of the oppressors and the
enlargement of the oppressed; this Israel saw when they saw themselves
unhurt, untouched. As it will aggravate the damnation of sinners that
with their eyes they shall behold and see the reward of the righteous
([Luk 13:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#028).md), so it will magnify the
salvation of the saints that with their eyes they shall behold and see
the destruction of the wicked, [Isa
66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024.md); [Psa
58:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#010.md).

[Psalms 91:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 91:9</span></span>

Here are more promises to the same purport with those in the foregoing
verses, and they are exceedingly great and precious, and sure to all the
seed.

I. The psalmist assures believers of divine protection, from his own
experience; and that which he says is the word of God, and what we may
rely upon. Observe, 1. The character of those who shall have the benefit
and comfort of these promises; it is much the same with that, [Psa
91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md). They are such as make the Most
High their habitation ([Psa 91:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#009).md), as
are continually with God and rest in him, as make his name both their
temple and their strong tower, as dwell in love and so dwell in God. It
is our duty to be at home in God, to make our choice of him, and then to
live our life in him as our habitation, to converse with him, and
delight in him, and depend upon him; and then it shall be our privilege
to be at home in God; we shall be welcome to him as a man to his own
habitation, without any let, hindrance, or molestation, from the arrests
of the law or the clamours of conscience; then too we shall be safe in
him, shall be kept in perfect peace, [Isa
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#003.md). To encourage us to make the Lord
our habitation, and to hope for safety and satisfaction in him, the
psalmist intimates the comfort he had had in doing so: "He whom thou
makest thy habitation is my refuge; and I have found him firm and
faithful, and in him there is room enough, and shelter enough, both for
thee and me." In my father's house there are many mansions, one needs
not crowd another, much less crowd out another. 2. The promises that are
sure to all those who have thus made the Most High their habitation.
(1.) That, whatever happens to them, nothing shall hurt them ([Psa
91:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#010).md): "There shall no evil befal
thee; though trouble or affliction befal thee, yet there shall be no
real evil in it, for it shall come from the love of God and shall be
sanctified; it shall come, not for thy hurt, but for thy good; and
though, for the present, it be not joyous but grievous, yet, in the end,
it shall yield so well that thou thyself shalt own no evil befel thee.
It is not an evil, an only evil, but there is a mixture of good in it
and a product of good by it. Nay, not thy person only, but thy dwelling,
shall be taken under the divine protection: There shall no plague come
nigh that, nothing to do thee or thine any damage." Nihil accidere bono
viro mali potest - No evil can befal a good man. Seneca De Providentia.
(2.) That the angels of light shall be serviceable to them, [Psa
91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md), [Psa
91:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#012.md). This is a precious promise, and
speaks a great deal both of honour and comfort to the saints, nor is it
ever the worse for being quoted and abused by the devil in tempting
Christ, [Mat 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#006.md). Observe, \[1.\] The
charge given to the angels concerning the saints. He who is the Lord of
the angels, who gave them their being and gives laws to them, whose they
are and whom they were made to serve, he shall give his angels a charge
over thee, not only over the church in general, but over every
particular believer. The angels keep the charge of the Lord their God;
and this is the charge they receive from him. It denotes the great care
God takes of the saints, in that the angels themselves shall be charged
with them, and employed for them. The charge is to keep thee in all thy
ways; here is a limitation of the promise: They shall keep thee in thy
ways, that is, "as long as thou keepest in the way of thy duty;" those
that go out of that way put themselves out of God's protection. This
word the devil left out when he quoted the promise to enforce a
temptation, knowing how much it made against him. But observe the extent
of the promise; it is to keep thee in all thy ways: even where there is
no apparent danger yet we need it, and where there is the most imminent
danger we shall have it. Wherever the saints go the angels are charged
with them, as the servants are with the children. \[2.\] The care which
the angels take of the saints, pursuant to this charge: They shall bear
thee up in their hands, which denotes both their great ability and their
great affection. They are able to bear up the saints out of the reach of
danger, and they do it with all the tenderness and affection wherewith
the nurse carries the little child about in her arms; it speaks us
helpless and them helpful. They are condescending in their
ministrations; they keep the feet of the saints, lest they dash them
against a stone, lest they stumble and fall into sin and into trouble.
\[3.\] That the powers of darkness shall be triumphed over by them ([Psa
91:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#013).md): Thou shalt tread upon the lion
and adder. The devil is called a roaring lion, the old serpent, the red
dragon; so that to this promise the apostle seems to refer in that ([Rom
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020).md), The God of peace shall tread
Satan under your feet. Christ has broken the serpent's head, spoiled our
spiritual enemies ([Col 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015).md), and
through him we are more than conquerors; for Christ calls us, as Joshua
called the captains of Israel, to come and set our feet on the necks of
vanquished enemies. Some think that this promise had its full
accomplishment in Christ, and the miraculous power which he had over the
whole creation, healing the sick, casting out devils, and particularly
putting it into his disciples' commission that they should take up
serpents, [Mar 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#018.md). It may be
applied to that care of the divine Providence by which we are preserved
from ravenous noxious creatures (the wild beasts of the field shall be
at peace with thee, [Job 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#023).md); nay,
and have ways and means of taming them, [Jam
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#007.md).

II\. He brings in God himself speaking words of comfort to the saints,
and declaring the mercy he had in store for them, [Psa
91:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#014.md). Some make this to be spoken
to the angels as the reason of the charge given them concerning the
saints, as if he had said, "Take care of them, for they are dear to me,
and I have a tender concern for them." And now, as before, we must
observe,

1\. To whom these promises do belong; they are described by three
characters: - (1.) They are such as know God's name. His nature we
cannot fully know; but by his name he has made himself known, and with
that we must acquaint ourselves. (2.) They are such as have set their
love upon him; and those who rightly know him will love him, will place
their love upon him as the only adequate object of it, will let out
their love towards him with pleasure and enlargement, and will fix their
love upon him with a resolution never to remove it to any rival. (3.)
They are such as call upon him, as by prayer keep up a constant
correspondence with him, and in every difficult case refer themselves to
him.

2\. What the promises are which God makes to the saints. (1.) That he
will, in due time, deliver them out of trouble: I will deliver him ([Psa
91:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#014.md) and again [Psa
91:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#015).md), denoting a double deliverance,
living and dying, a deliverance in trouble and a deliverance out of
trouble. If God proportions the degree and continuance of our troubles
to our strength, if he keeps us from offending him in our troubles, and
makes our death our discharge, at length, from all our troubles, then
this promise is fulfilled. See [Psa
34:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#019.md); [Ti2
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#011.md); [Ti2
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#018). (2..md) That he will, in the mean
time, be with them in trouble, [Psa
91:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#015.md). If he does not immediately put
a period to their afflictions, yet they shall have his gracious presence
with them in their troubles; he will take notice of their sorrows, and
know their souls in adversity, will visit them graciously by his word
and Spirit, and converse with them, will take their part, will support
and comfort them, and sanctify their afflictions to them, which will be
the surest token of his presence with them in their troubles. (3.) That
herein he will answer their prayers: He shall call upon me; I will pour
upon him the spirit of prayer, and then I will answer, answer by
promises ([Psa 85:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#008).md), answer by
providences, bringing in seasonable relief, and answer by graces,
strengthening them with strength in their souls ([Psa
138:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#003).md); thus he answered Paul with
grace sufficient, [Co2 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009). (4..md) That
he will exalt and dignify them: I will set him on high, out of the reach
of trouble, above the stormy region, on a rock above the waves, [Isa
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#016.md). They shall be enabled, by the
grace of God, to look down upon the things of this world with a holy
contempt and indifference, to look up to the things of the other world
with a holy ambition and concern; and then they are set on high. I will
honour him; those are truly honourable whom God puts honour upon by
taking them into covenant and communion with himself and designing them
for his kingdom and glory, [Joh 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#026.md).
(5.) That they shall have a sufficiency of life in this world ([Psa
91:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#016).md): With length of days will I
satisfy him; that is, \[1.\] They shall live long enough: they shall be
continued in this world till they have done the work they were sent into
this world for and are ready for heaven, and that is long enough. Who
would wish to live a day longer than God has some work to do, either by
him or upon him? \[2.\] They shall think it long enough; for God by his
grace shall wean them from the world and make them willing to leave it.
A man may die young, and yet die full of days, satur dierum - satisfied
with living. A wicked worldly man is not satisfied, no, not with long
life; he still cries, Give, give. But he that has his treasure and heart
in another world has soon enough of this; he would not live always. (6.)
That they shall have an eternal life in the other world. This crowns the
blessedness: I will show him my salvation, show him the Messiah (so
some); good old Simeon was then satisfied with long life when he could
say, My eyes have seen thy salvation, nor was there any greater joy to
the Old Testament saints than to see Christ's day, though at a distance.
It is more probably that the word refers to the better country, that is,
the heavenly, which the patriarchs desired and sought: he will show him
that, bring him to that blessed state, the felicity of which consists so
much in seeing that face to face which we here see through a glass
darkly; and, in the mean time, he will give him a prospect of it. All
these promises, some think, point primarily at Christ, and had their
accomplishment in his resurrection and exaltation.
