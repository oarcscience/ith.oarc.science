### [Proverbs Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">pro 3:0</span></span>

This chapter is one of the most excellent in all this book, both for
argument to persuade us to be religious and for directions therein. I.
We must be constant to our duty because that is the way to be happy
([Pro 3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#001).md). II. We must live a life
of dependence upon God because that is the way to be safe ([Pro
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#005).md). III. We must keep up the fear of
God because that is the way to be healthful ([Pro
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#007.md), [Pro
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#008).md). IV. We must serve God with our
estates because that is the way to be rich ([Pro
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#009.md), [Pro
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#010).md). V. We must hear afflictions
well because that is the way to get good by them ([Pro
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011.md), [Pro
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#012).md). VI. We must take pains to
obtain wisdom because that is the way to gain her, and to gain by her
([Pro 3:13-20](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#013).md). VII. We must always
govern ourselves by the rules of wisdom, of right reason and religion,
because that is the way to be always easy ([Pro
3:21-26](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#021).md). VIII. We must do all the
good we can, and no hurt, to our neighbours, because according as men
are just or unjust, charitable or uncharitable, humble or haughty,
accordingly they shall receive of God ([Pro
3:27-35](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#027).md). From all this it appears
what a tendency religion has to make men both blessed and blessings.

[Proverbs 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 3:1</span></span>

We are here taught to live a life of communion with God; and without
controversy great is this mystery of godliness, and of great consequence
to us, and, as is here shown, will be of unspeakable advantage.

I. We must have a continual regard to God's precepts, [Pro
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#001.md), [Pro
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#002.md).

1\. We must, (1.) Fix God's law, and his commandments, as our rule, by
which we will in every thing be ruled and to which we will yield
obedience. (2.) We must acquaint ourselves with them; for we cannot be
said to forget that which we never knew. (3.) We must remember them so
that they may be ready to us whenever we have occasion to use them. (4.)
Our wills and affections must be subject to them and must in every thing
conform to them. Not only our heads, but our hearts, must keep God's
commandments; in them, as in the ark of the testimony, both the tables
of the law must be deposited.

2\. To encourage us to submit ourselves to all the restraints and
injunctions of the divine law, we are assured ([Pro
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#002).md) that it is the certain way to
long life and prosperity. (1.) It is the way to be long-lived. God's
commandments shall add to us length of days; to a good useful life on
earth, they shall add an eternal life in heaven, length of days for ever
and ever, [Psa 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004.md). God shall be our
life and the length of our days, and that will be indeed long life, with
an addition. But, because length of days may possibly become a burden
and a trouble, it is promised, (2.) That it shall prove the way to be
easy too, so that even the days of old age shall not be evil days, but
days in which thou shalt have pleasure: Peace shall they be continually
adding to thee. As grace increases, peace shall increase; and of the
increase of Christ's government and peace, in the heart as well as in
the world, there shall be no end. Great and growing peace have those
that love the law.

II\. We must have a continual regard to God's promises, which go along
with his precepts, and are to be received, and retained, with them ([Pro
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003).md): "Let not mercy and truth forsake
thee, God's mercy in promising, and his truth in performing. Do not
forfeit these, but live up to them, and preserve thy interest in them;
do not forget these, but live upon them, and take the comfort of them.
Bind them about thy neck, as the most graceful ornament." It is the
greatest honour we are capable of in this world to have an interest in
the mercy and truth of God. "Write to them upon the table of thy heart,
as dear to thee, thy portion, and most delightful entertainment; take a
pleasure in applying them and thinking them over." Or it may be meant of
the mercy and truth which are our duty, piety and sincerity, charity
towards men, fidelity towards God. Let these be fixed and commanding
principles in thee. To encourage us to do this we are assured ([Pro
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#004).md) that this is the way to recommend
ourselves both to our Creator and fellow-creatures: So shalt thou find
favour and good understanding. 1. A good man seeks the favour of God in
the first place, is ambitious of the honour of being accepted of the
Lord, and he shall find that favour, and with it a good understanding;
God will make the best of him, and put a favourable construction upon
what he says and does. He shall be owned as one of Wisdom's children,
and shall have praise with God, as one having that good understanding
which is ascribed to all those that do his commandments. 2. He wishes to
have favour with men also (as Christ had, [Luk
2:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#052).md), to be accepted of the multitude
of his brethren ([Est 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#003).md), and that
he shall have; they shall understand him aright, and in his dealings
with them he shall appear to be prudent, shall act intelligently and
with discretion. He shall have good success (so some translate it), the
common effect of good understanding.

III\. We must have a continual regard to God's providence, must own and
depend upon it in all our affairs, both by faith and prayer. 1. By
faith. We must repose an entire confidence in the wisdom, power, and
goodness of God, assuring ourselves of the extent of his providence to
all the creatures and all their actions. We must therefore trust in the
Lord with all our hearts ([Pro 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#005).md);
we must believe that he is able to do what he will, wise to do what is
best, and good, according to his promise, to do what is best for us, if
we love him, and serve him. We must, with an entire submission and
satisfaction, depend upon him to perform all things for us, and not lean
to our own understanding, as if we could, by any forecast of our own,
without God, help ourselves, and bring our affairs to a good issue.
Those who know themselves cannot but find their own understanding to be
a broken reed, which, if they lean to, will certainly fail them. In all
our conduct we must be diffident of our own judgment, and confident of
God's wisdom, power, and goodness, and therefore must follow Providence
and not force it. That often proves best which was least our own doing.
2. By prayer ([Pro 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#006).md): In all thy
ways acknowledge God. We must not only in our judgment believe that
there is an over-ruling hand of God ordering and disposing of us and all
our affairs, but we must solemnly own it, and address ourselves to him
accordingly. We must ask his leave, and not design any thing but what we
are sure is lawful. We must ask his advice and beg direction from him,
not only when the case is difficult (when we know not what to do, no
thanks to us that we have our eyes up to him), but in every case, be it
ever so plain, We must ask success of him, as those who know the race is
not to the swift. We must refer ourselves to him as one from whom our
judgment proceeds, and patiently, and with a holy indifferency, wait his
award. In all our ways that prove direct, and fair, and pleasant, in
which we gain our point to our satisfaction, we must acknowledge God
with thankfulness. In all our ways that prove cross and uncomfortable,
and that are hedged up with thorns, we must acknowledge God with
submission. Our eye must be ever towards God; to him we must, in every
thing, make our requests known, as Jephthah uttered all his words before
the Lord in Mizpeh, [Jdg 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#011.md). For
our encouragement to do this, it is promised, "He shall direct thy
paths, so that thy way shall be safe and good and the issue happy at
last." Note, Those that put themselves under a divine guidance shall
always have the benefit of it. God will give them that wisdom which is
profitable to direct, so that they shall not turn aside into the
by-paths of sin, and then will himself so wisely order the event that it
shall be to their mind, or (which is equivalent) for their good. Those
that faithfully follow the pillar of cloud and fire shall find that
though it may lead them about it leads them the right way and will bring
them to Canaan at last.

[Proverbs 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 3:7</span></span>

We have here before us three exhortations, each of them enforced with a
good reason: -

I. We must live in a humble and dutiful subjection to God and his
government ([Pro 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#007).md): "Fear the Lord,
as your sovereign Lord and Master; be ruled in every thing by your
religion and subject to the divine will." This must be, 1. A humble
subjection: Be not wise in thy own eyes. Note, There is not a greater
enemy to the power of religion, and the fear of God in the heart, than
conceitedness of our own wisdom. Those that have an opinion of their own
sufficiency think it below them, and a disparagement to them, to take
their measures from, much more to hamper themselves with, religion's
rules. 2. A dutiful subjection: Fear the Lord, and depart from evil;
take heed of doing any thing to offend him and to forfeit his care. To
fear the Lord, so as to depart from evil, is true wisdom and
understanding ([Job 28:28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028).md); those that
have it are truly wise, but self-denyingly so, and not wise in their own
eyes. For our encouragement thus to live in the fear of God it is here
promised ([Pro 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#008).md) that it shall be
as serviceable even to the outward man as our necessary food. It will be
nourishing: It shall be health to thy navel. It will be strengthening:
It shall be marrow to thy bones. The prudence, temperance, and sobriety,
the calmness and composure of mind, and the good government of the
appetites and passions, which religion teaches, tend very much not only
to the health of the soul, but to a good habit of body, which is very
desirable, and without which our other enjoyments in this world are
insipid. Envy is the rottenness of the bones; the sorrow of the world
dries them; but hope and joy in God are marrow to them.

II\. We must make a good use of our estates, and that is the way to
increase them, [Pro 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#009.md), [Pro
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#010.md). Here is,

1\. A precept which makes it our duty to serve God with our estates:
Honour the Lord with thy substance. It is the end of our creation and
redemption to honour God, to be to him for a name and a praise; we are
no other way capable of serving him than in his honour. His honour we
must show forth and the honour we have for him. We must honour him, not
only with our bodies and spirits which are his, but with our estates
too, for they also are his: we and all our appurtenances must be devoted
to his glory. Worldly wealth is but poor substance, yet, such as it is,
we must honour God with it, and then, if ever, it becomes substantial.
We must honour God, (1.) With our increase. Where riches increase we are
tempted to honour ourselves ([Deu
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#017).md) and to set our hearts upon the
world ([Psa 62:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#010).md); but the more God
gives us the more we should study to honour him. It is meant of the
increase of the earth, for we live upon annual products, to keep us in
constant dependence on God. (2.) With all our increase. As God has
prospered us in every thing, we must honour him. Our law will allow a
prescription for a modus decimandi - a mode of tithing, but none de non
decimando - for exemption from paying tithes. (3.) With the first-fruits
of all, as Abel, [Gen 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#004.md). This was
the law ([Exo 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019).md), and the
prophets, [Mal 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#010.md). God, who is the
first and best, must have the first and best of every thing; his right
is prior to all other, and therefore he must be served first. Note, It
is our duty to make our worldly estates serviceable to our religion, to
use them and the interest we have by them for the promoting of religion,
to do good to the poor with what we have and abound in all works of
piety and charity, devising liberal things.

2\. A promise, which makes it our interest to serve God with our
estates. It is the way to make a little much, and much more; it is the
surest and safest method of thriving: So shall thy barns be filled with
plenty. He does not say thy bags, but thy barns, not thy wardrobe
replenished, but thy presses: "God shall bless thee with an increase of
that which is for use, not for show or ornament - for spending and
laying out, not for hoarding and laying up." Those that do good with
what they have shall have more to do more good with. Note, If we make
our worldly estates serviceable to our religion we shall find our
religion very serviceable to the prosperity of our worldly affairs.
Godliness has the promise of the life that now is and most of the
comfort of it. We mistake if we think that giving will undo us and make
us poor. No, giving for God's honour will make us rich, [Hag
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#019.md). What we gave we have.

III\. We must conduct ourselves aright under our afflictions, [Pro
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011.md), [Pro
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#012.md). This the apostle quotes ([Heb
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#005).md), and calls it an exhortation
which speaks unto us as unto children, with the authority and affection
of a father. We are here in a world of troubles. Now observe,

1\. What must be our care when we are in affliction. We must neither
despise it nor be weary of it. His exhortation, before, was to those
that are rich and in prosperity, here to those that are poor and in
adversity. (1.) We must not despise an affliction, be it ever so light
and short, as if it were not worth taking notice of, or as if it were
not sent on an errand and therefore required no answer. We must not be
stocks, and stones, and stoics, under our afflictions, insensible of
them, hardening ourselves under them, and concluding we can easily get
through them without God. (2.) We must not be weary of an affliction, be
it ever so heavy and long, not faint under it, so the apostle renders
it, not be dispirited, dispossessed of our own souls, or driven to
despair, or to use any indirect means for our relief and the redress of
our grievances. We must not think that the affliction either presses
harder or continues longer than is meet, not conclude that deliverance
will never come because it does not come so soon as we expect it.

2\. What will be our comfort when we are in affliction. (1.) That it is
a divine correction; it is the chastening of the Lord, which, as it is a
reason why we should submit to it (for it is folly to contend with a God
of incontestable sovereignty and irresistible power), so it is a reason
why we should be satisfied in it; for we may be sure that a God of
unspotted purity does us no wrong and that a God of infinite goodness
means us no hurt. It is from God, and therefore must not be despised;
for a slight put upon the messenger is an affront to him that sends him.
It is from God, and therefore we must not be weary of it, for he knows
our frame, both what we need and what we can bear. (2.) That it is a
fatherly correction; it comes not from his vindictive justice as a
Judge, but his wise affection as a Father. The father corrects the son
whom he loves, nay, and because he loves him and desires he may be wise
and good. He delights in that in his son which is amiable and agreeable,
and therefore corrects him for the prevention and cure of that which
would be a deformity to him, and an alloy to his delight in him. Thus
God hath said, As many as I love I rebuke and chasten, [Rev
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#019.md). This is a great comfort to God's
children, under their afflictions, \[1.\] That they not only consist
with, but flow from, covenant-love. \[2.\] That they are so far from
doing them any real hurt that, by the grace of God working with them,
they do a great deal of good, and are happy means of their satisfaction.

[Proverbs 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 3:13</span></span>

Solomon had pressed us earnestly to seek diligently for wisdom ([Pro
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#001), etc..md), and had assured us that we
should succeed in our sincere and constant pursuits. But the question
is, What shall we get by it when we have found it? Prospect of advantage
is the spring and spur of industry; he therefore shows us how much it
will be to our profit, laying this down for an unquestionable truth,
Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, that true wisdom which consists in
the knowledge and love of God, and an entire conformity to all the
intentions of his truths, providences, and laws. Now observe,

I. What it is to find wisdom so as to be made happy by it.

1\. We must get it. He is the happy man who, having found it, makes it
his own, gets both an interest in it and the possession of it, who draws
out understanding (so the word it), that is, (1.) Who derives it from
God. Having it not in himself, he draws it with the bucket of prayer
from the fountain of all wisdom, who gives liberally. (2.) Who takes
pains for it, as he does who draws ore out of the mine. It if do not
come easily, we must put the more strength to draw it. (3.) Who improves
in it, who, having some understanding, draws it out by growing in
knowledge and making five talents ten. (4.) Who does good with it, who
draws out from the stock he has, as wine from the vessel, and
communicates to others, for their instruction, things new and old. That
is well got, and to good purpose, that is thus used to good purpose.

2\. We must trade for it. We read here of the merchandise of wisdom,
which intimates, (1.) That we must make it our business, and not a
by-business, as the merchant bestows the main of his thoughts and time
upon his merchandise. (2.) That we must venture all in it, as a stock in
trade, and be willing to part with all for it. This is that pearl of
great price which, when we have found it, we must willingly sell all for
the purchase of, [Mat 13:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#045.md), [Mat
13:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#046.md). Buy the truth, ([Pro
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#023).md); he does not say at what rate,
because we must buy it at any rate rather than miss it.

3\. We must lay hold on it as we lay hold on a good bargain when it is
offered to us, which we do the more carefully if there be danger of
having it taken out of our hands. We must apprehend with all our might,
and put forth our utmost vigour in the pursuit of it, lay hold on all
occasions to improve in it, and catch at the least of its dictates.

4\. We must retain it. It is not enough to lay hold on wisdom, but we
must keep our hold, hold it fast, with a resolution never to let it go,
but to persevere in the ways of wisdom to the end. We must sustain it
(so some read it), must embrace it with all our might, as we do that
which we would sustain. We must do all we can to support the declining
interests of religion in the places where we live.

II\. What the happiness of those is who do find it.

1\. It is a transcendent happiness, more than can be found in the wealth
of this world, if we had ever so much of it, [Pro
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#014.md), [Pro
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#015.md). It is not only a surer, but a
more gainful merchandise to trade for wisdom, for Christ, and grace, and
spiritual blessings, than for silver, and gold, and rubies. Suppose a
man to have got these in abundance, nay, to have all the things he can
desire of this world (and who is it that ever had?), yet, (1.) All this
would not purchase heavenly wisdom; no, it would utterly be contemned;
it cannot be gotten for gold, [Job
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#015), etc. (2..md) All this would not
countervail the want of heavenly wisdom nor be the ransom of a soul lost
by its own folly. (3.) All this would not make a man half so happy, no,
not in this world, as those are who have true wisdom, though they have
none of all these things. (4.) Heavenly wisdom will procure that for us,
and secure that to us, which silver, and gold, and rubies, will not be
the purchase of.

2\. It is a true happiness; for it is inclusive of, and equivalent to,
all those things which are supposed to make men happy, [Pro
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#016.md), [Pro
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#017.md). Wisdom is here represented as a
bright and bountiful queen, reaching forth gifts to her faithful and
loving subjects, and offering them to all that will submit to her
government. (1.) Is length of days a blessing? Yes, the most valuable;
life includes all good, and therefore she offers that in her right hand.
Religion puts us into the best methods of prolonging life, entitles us
to the promises of it, and, though our days on earth should be no more
than our neighbour's, yet it will secure to us everlasting life in a
better world. (2.) Are riches and honour accounted blessings? They are
so, and them she reaches out with her left hand. For, as she is ready to
embrace those that submit to her with both arms, so she is ready to give
out to them with both hands. They shall have the wealth of this world as
far as Infinite Wisdom sees good for them; while the true riches, by
which men are rich towards God, are secured to them. Nor is there any
honour, by birth or preferment, comparable to that which attends
religion; it makes the righteous more excellent than his neighbour,
recommends men to God, commands respect and veneration with all the
sober part of mankind, and will in the other world make those that are
now buried in obscurity to shine forth as the sun. (3.) Is pleasure
courted as much as any thing? It is so, and it is certain that true
piety has in it the greatest true pleasure. Her ways are ways of
pleasantness; the ways in which she has directed us to walk are such as
we shall find abundance of delight and satisfaction in. All the
enjoyments and entertainments of sense are not comparable to the
pleasure which gracious souls have in communion with God and doing good.
That which is the only right way to bring us to our journey's end we
must walk in, fair or foul, pleasant or unpleasant; but the way of
religion, as it is the right way, so it is a pleasant way; it is smooth
and clean, and strewed with roses: All her paths are peace. There is not
only peace in the end, but peace in the way; not only in the way of
religion in general, but in the particular paths of that way, in all her
paths, all the several acts, instances, and duties of it. One does not
embitter what the other sweetens, as it is with the allays of this
world; but they are all peace, not only sweet, but safe. The saints
enter into peace on this side heaven, and enjoy a present sabbatism.

3\. It is the happiness of paradise ([Pro
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#018).md): She is a tree of life. True
grace is that to the soul which the tree of life would have been, from
which our first parents were shut out for eating of the forbidden tree.
It is a seed of immortality, a well of living waters, springing up to
life eternal. It is an earnest of the New Jerusalem, in the midst of
which is the tree of life, [Rev 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#002.md);
[Rev 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007.md). Those that feed and feast on
this heavenly wisdom shall not only be cured by it of every fatal
malady, but shall find an antidote against age and death; they shall eat
and live for ever.

4\. It is a participation of the happiness of God himself, for wisdom is
his everlasting glory and blessedness, [Pro
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#019.md), [Pro
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#020.md). This should make us in love with
the wisdom and understanding which God gives, that the Lord by wisdom
founded the earth, so that it cannot be removed, nor can ever fail of
answering all the ends of its creation, to which it is admirably and
unexceptionably fitted. By understanding he has likewise established the
heavens and directed all the motions of them in the best manner. The
heavenly bodies are vast, yet there is no flaw in them - numerous, yet
no disorder in them - the motion rapid, yet no wear or tear; the depths
of the sea are broken up, and thence come the waters beneath the
firmament, and the clouds drop down the dews, the waters from above the
firmament, and all this by the divine wisdom and knowledge; therefore
happy is the man that finds wisdom, for he will thereby be thoroughly
furnished for every good word and work. Christ is that Wisdom, by whom
the worlds were made and still consist; happy therefore are those to
whom he is made of God wisdom, for he has wherewithal to make good all
the foregoing promises of long life, riches, and honour; for all the
wealth of heaven, earth, and seas, is his.

[Proverbs 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 3:21</span></span>

Solomon, having pronounced those happy who not only lay hold on wisdom,
but retain her, here exhorts us therefore to retain her, assuring us
that we ourselves shall have the comfort of doing so.

I. The exhortation is, to have religion's rules always in view and
always at heart, [Pro 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#021.md). 1. To have
them always in view: "My son, let them not depart from thy eyes; let not
thy eyes ever depart from them to wander after vanity. Have them always
in mind, and do not forget them; be ever and anon thinking of them, and
conversing with them, and never imagine that thou hast looked upon them
long enough and that it is time now to lay them by; but, as long as thou
livest, keep up and cultivate thy acquaintance with them." He who learns
to write must always have his eye upon his copy, and not let that be out
of his sight; and to the words of wisdom must those, in like manner,
have a constant respect, who will walk circumspectly. 2. To have them
always at heart; for it is in that treasury, the hidden man of the
heart, that we must keep sound wisdom and discretion, keep to the
principles of it and keep in the ways of it. It is wealth that is worth
keeping.

II\. The argument to enforce this exhortation is taken from the
unspeakable advantage which wisdom, thus kept, will be of to us. 1. In
respect of strength and satisfaction: "It will be life to thy soul ([Pro
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#022).md); it will quicken thee to thy
duty when thou beginnest to be slothful and remiss; it will revive thee
under thy troubles when thou beginnest to droop and despond. It will be
thy spiritual life, an earnest of life eternal." Life to the soul is
life indeed. 2. In respect of honour and reputation: It shall be grace
to thy neck, as a chain of gold, or a jewel. Grace to thy jaws (so the
word is), grateful to thy taste and relish (so some); it shall infuse
grace into all thou sayest (so others), shall furnish thee with
acceptable words, which shall gain thee credit. 3. In respect of safety
and security. This he insists upon in four verses, the scope of which is
to show that the effect of righteousness (which is the same with wisdom
here) is quietness and assurance for ever, [Isa
32:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#017.md). Good people are taken under
God's special protection, and therein they may have an entire
satisfaction. They are safe and may be easy, (1.) In their motions by
day, [Pro 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#023.md). If our religion be our
companion, it will be our convoy: "Then shalt thou walk in thy way
safely. The natural life, and all that belongs to it, shall be under the
protection of God's providence; the spiritual life, and all its
interests, are under the protection of his grace; so that thou shalt be
kept from falling into sin or trouble." Wisdom will direct us into, and
keep us in, the safe way, as far as may be, from temptation, and will
enable us to walk in it with holy security. The way of duty is the way
of safety. "We are in danger of falling, but wisdom will keep thee, that
thy foot shall not stumble at those things which are an offence and
overthrow to many, but which thou shalt know how to get over." (2.) In
their rest by night, [Pro 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#024.md). In our
retirements we lie exposed and are most subject to frights. "But keep up
communion with God, and keep a good conscience, and then when thou liest
down thou shalt not be afraid of fire, or thieves, or specters, or any
of the terrors of darkness, knowing that when we, and all our friends,
are asleep, yet he that keeps Israel and every true-born Israelite
neither slumbers nor sleeps, and to him thou hast committed thyself and
taken shelter under the shadow of his wings. Thou shalt lie down, and
not need to sit up to keep guard; having lain down, thou shalt sleep,
and not have thy eyes held waking by care and fear; and thy sleep shall
be sweet and refreshing to thee, being not disturbed by any alarms from
without or from within," [Psa 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#008.md);
[Psa 116:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#007.md). The way to have a good
night is to keep a good conscience; and the sleep, as of the labouring
man, so of the wise and godly man, is sweet. (3.) In their greatest
straits and dangers. Integrity and uprightness will preserve us, so that
we need not be afraid of sudden fear, [Pro
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#025.md). The harms that surprise us,
unthought of, giving us no time to arm ourselves by consideration, are
most likely to put us into confusion. But let not the wise and good man
forget himself, and then he will not give way to any fear that has
torment, be the alarm ever so sudden. Let him not fear the desolation of
the wicked, when it comes, that is, \[1.\] The desolation which the
wicked ones make of religion and the religious; though it comes, and
seems to be just at the door, yet be not afraid of it; for, though God
may make use of the wicked as instruments of his people's correction,
yet he will never suffer them to be the authors of their desolation. Or
rather, \[2.\] The desolation which wicked men will be brought into in a
moment. It will come, and timorous saints may be apprehensive that they
shall be involved in it; but let this be their comfort, that though
judgments lay waste generally, at least promiscuously, yet God knows who
are his and how to separate between the precious and the vile. Therefore
be not afraid of that which appears most formidable, for ([Pro
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#026).md) "the Lord shall be not only thy
protector to keep thee safe, but thy confidence to keep thee secure, so
that thy foot shall not be taken by thy enemies nor ensnared by thy own
fears." God has engaged to keep the feet of his saints.

[Proverbs 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 3:27</span></span>

True wisdom consists in the due discharge of our duty towards man, as
well as towards God, in honesty as well as piety, and therefore we have
here divers excellent precepts of wisdom which relate to our neighbour.

I. We must render to all their due, both in justice and charity, and not
delay to do it ([Pro 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#027.md), [Pro
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#028).md): "Withhold not good from those
to whom it is due (either for want of love to them or through too much
love to thy money) when it is in the power of thy hand to do it, for, if
it be not, it cannot be expected; but it was thy great fault if thou
didst, by thy extravagances, disable thyself to do justly and show
mercy, and it ought to be the greatest of thy griefs if God had disabled
thee, not so much that thou art straitened in thy own comforts and
conveniences as that thou hast not wherewithal to give to those to whom
it is due." Withhold it not; this implies that it is called for and
expected, but that the hand is drawn in and the bowels of compassion are
shut up. We must not hinder others from doing it, not be ourselves
backward to it. "If thou hast it by thee today, hast it in the power of
thy hand, say not to thy neighbour, Go thy way for this time, and come
at a more convenient season, and I will then see what will be done;
tomorrow I will give; whereas thou art not sure that thou shalt live
till tomorrow, or that tomorrow thou shalt have it by thee. Be not thus
loth to part with thy money upon a good account. Make not excuses to
shift off a duty that must be done, nor delight to keep thy neighbour in
pain and in suspense, nor to show the authority which the giver has over
the beggar; but readily and cheerfully, and from a principle of
conscience towards God, give good to those to whom it is due," to the
lords and owners of it (so the word is), to those who upon any account
are entitled to it. This requires us, 1. To pay our just debts without
fraud, covin, or delay. 2. To give wages to those who have earned them.
3. To provide for our relations, and those that have dependence on us,
for to them it is due. 4. To render dues both to church and state,
magistrates and ministers. 5. To be ready to all acts of friendship and
humanity, and in every thing to be neighbourly; for these are things
that are due by the law of doing as we would be done by. 6. To be
charitable to the poor and necessitous. If others want the necessary
supports of life, and we have wherewithal to supply them, we must look
upon it as due to them and not withhold it. Alms are called
righteousness because they are a debt to the poor, and a debt which we
must not defer to pay, Bis dat, qui cito dat - He gives twice who gives
speedily.

II\. We must never design any hurt or harm to any body ([Pro
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#029).md): "Devise not evil against thy
neighbour; do not contrive how to do him an ill-turn undiscovered, to
prejudice him in his body, goods, or good name, and the rather because
he dwells securely by thee, and, having given thee no provocation,
entertains no jealousy or suspicion of thee, and therefore is off his
guard." It is against the laws both of honour and friendship to do a man
an ill-turn and give him no warning. Cursed be he that smites his
neighbour secretly. It is a most base ungrateful thing, if our
neighbours have a good opinion of us, that we will do them no harm, and
we thence take advantage to cheat and injure them.

III\. We must not be quarrelsome and litigious ([Pro
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#030).md): "Do not strive with a man
without cause; contend not for that which thou hast no title to; resent
not that as a provocation which peradventure was but an oversight. Never
trouble thy neighbour with frivolous complaints and accusations, or
vexatious law-suits, when either there is no harm done thee or none
worth speaking of, or thou mightest right thyself in a friendly way."
Law must be the last refuge; for it is not only our duty, but our
interest, as much as in us lies, to live peaceably with all men. When
accounts are balanced, it will be found there is little got by striving.

IV\. We must not envy the prosperity of evil-doers, [Pro
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#031.md). This caution is the same with
that which is so much insisted on, Ps. 37. "Envy not the oppressor;
though he be rich and great, though he live in ease and pleasure, and
make all about him to stand in awe of him, yet do not think him a happy
man, nor wish thyself in his condition. Choose none of his ways; do not
imitate him, nor take the courses he takes to enrich himself. Never
think of doing as he does, though thou wert sure to get by it all that
he has, for it would be dearly bought." Now, to show what little reason
saints have to envy sinners, Solomon here, in the last four verses of
the chapter, compares the condition of sinners and saints together (as
his father David had done, Ps. 37), sets the one over against the other,
that we may see how happy the saints are, though they be oppressed, and
how miserable the wicked are, though they be oppressors. Men are to be
judged of as they stand with God, and as he judges of them, not as they
stand in the world's books. Those are in the right who are of God's
mind; and, if we be of his mind, we shall see, whatever pretence one
sinner may have to envy another, that saints are so happy themselves
that they have no reason at all to envy any sinner, though his condition
be ever so prosperous. For, 1. Sinners are hated of God, but saints are
beloved, [Pro 3:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#032.md). The froward
sinners, who are continually going from-ward him, whose lives are a
perverse contradiction to his will, are abomination to the Lord. He that
hates nothing that he has made yet abhors those who have thus marred
themselves; they are not only abominable in his sight, but an
abomination. The righteous therefore have no reason to envy them, for
they have his secret with them; they are his favourites; he has that
communion with them which is a secret to the world and in which they
have a joy that a stranger does not intermeddle with; he communicates to
them the secret tokens of his love; his covenant is with them; they know
his mind, and the meanings and intentions of his providence, better than
others can. Shall I hide from Abraham the thing that I do? 2. Sinners
are under the curse of God, they and their houses; saints are under his
blessing, they and their habitation, [Pro
3:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#033.md). The wicked has a house, a strong
and stately dwelling perhaps, but the curse of the Lord is upon it, it
is in it, and, though the affairs of the family may prosper, yet the
very blessings are curses, [Mal 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#002.md).
There is leanness in the soul, when the body is fed to the full, [Psa
106:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#015.md). The curse may work silently
and slowly; but it is as a fretting leprosy; it will consume the timber
thereof and the stones thereof, [Zac
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#004.md); [Hab
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#011.md). The just have a habitation, a
poor cottage (the word is used for sheep-cotes), a very mean dwelling;
but God blesses it; he is continually blessing it, from the beginning of
the year to the end of it. The curse or blessing of God is upon the
house according as the inhabitants are wicked or godly; and it is
certain that a blessed family, though poor, has no reason to envy a
cursed family, though rich. 3. God puts contempt upon sinners, but shows
respect to saints, [Pro 3:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034). (1..md)
Those who exalt themselves shall certainly be abased: Surely he scorns
the scorners. Those who scorn to submit to the discipline of religion,
scorn to take God's yoke upon them, scorn to be beholden to his grace,
who scoff at godliness and godly people, and take a pleasure in
bantering and exposing them, God will scorn them, and lay them open to
scorn before all the world. He despises their impotent malice, sits in
heaven and laughs at them, [Psa 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004.md).
He retaliates upon them ([Psa 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026).md);
he resists the proud. (2.) Those who humble themselves shall be exalted,
for he gives grace to the lowly; he works that in them which puts honour
upon them and for which they are accepted of God and approved of men.
Those who patiently bear contempt from scornful men shall have respect
from God and all good men, and then they have no reason to envy the
scorners or to choose their ways. 4. The end of sinners will be
everlasting shame, the end of saints endless honour, [Pro
3:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#035). (1..md) Saints are wise men, and
act wisely for themselves; for though their religion now wraps them up
in obscurity, and lays them open to reproach, yet they are sure to
inherit glory at last, the far more exceeding and eternal weight of
glory. They shall have it, and have it by inheritance, the sweetest and
surest tenure. God gives them grace ([Pro
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034).md), and therefore they shall
inherit glory, for grace is glory, [Co2
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018.md). It is glory begun, the earnest
of it, [Psa 84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011). (2..md) Sinners are
fools, for they are not only preparing disgrace for themselves, but at
the same time flattering themselves with a prospect of honour, as if
they only took the way to be great. Their end will manifest their folly:
Shame shall be their promotion. And it will be so much the more their
punishment as it will come instead of their promotion; it will be all
the promotion they must ever expect, that God will be glorified in their
everlasting confusion.
