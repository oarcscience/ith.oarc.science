### [Micah Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001.md)

[Micah](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mic 3:0</span></span>

What the apostle says of another of the prophets is true of this, who
was also his contemporary - "Esaias is very bold," [Rom
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#020.md). So, in this chapter, Micah is
very bold in reproving and threatening the great men that were the
ringleaders in sin; and he gives the reason ([Mic
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#008).md) why he was so bold, because he
had commission and instruction from God to say what he said, and was
carried out in it by a higher spirit and power than his own. Magistracy
and ministry are two great ordinances of God, for good to his church,
but these were both corrupted and the intentions of them perverted; and
upon those that abused them, and so abused the church with them, the
prophet is very severe, and justly so. I. He gives them their lesson
severally, reproving and threatening princes ([Mic
3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001).md) and false flattering prophets
([Mic 3:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#005).md). II. He gives them their
lesson jointly, putting them together, as acting in conjunction for the
ruin of the kingdom, which they should see the ruins of ([Mic
3:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#009).md).

[Micah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 3:1</span></span>

Princes and prophets, when they faithfully discharge the duty of their
office, are to be highly honoured above other men; but when they betray
their trust, and act contrary to it, they should hear of their faults as
well as others, and shall be made to know that there is a God above
them, to whom they are accountable; at his bar the prophet here, in his
name, arraigns them.

I. Let the princes hear their charge and their doom. The heads of Jacob,
and the princes of the house of Israel, are called upon to hear what the
prophet has to say to them, [Mic 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001.md).
The word of God has reproofs for the greatest of men, which the
ministers of that word ought to apply as there is occasion. The prophet
here has comfort in the reflection upon it, that, whatever the success
was, he had faithfully discharged his trust: And I said, Hear, O
princes! He had the testimony of his conscience for him that he had not
shrunk from his duty for fear of the face of men. He tells them,

1\. What was expected from them: Is it not for you to know judgment? He
means to do judgment, for otherwise the knowledge of it is of no avail.
"Is it not your business to administer justice impartially, and not to
know faces" (as the Hebrew phrase for partiality and respect of persons
is), "but to know judgment, and the merits of every cause?" Or it may be
taken for granted that the heads and rulers are well acquainted with the
rules of justice, whatever others are; for they have those means of
knowledge, and have not those excuses for ignorance, which some others
have, that are poor and foolish ([Jer
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#004).md); and, if so, their transgression
of the laws of justice is the more provoking to God, for they sin
against knowledge. "Is it not for you to know judgment? Yes, it is;
therefore stand still, and hear your own judgment, and judge if it be
not right, whether any thing can be objected against it."

2\. How wretchedly they had transgressed the rules of judgment, though
they knew what they were. Their principle and disposition are bad: They
hate the good and love the evil; they hate good in others, and hate it
should have any influence on themselves; they hate to do good, hate to
have any good done, and hate those that are good and do good; and they
love the evil, delight in mischief. This being their principle, their
practice is according to it; they are very cruel and severe towards
those that are under their power, and whoever lies at their mercy will
find that they have none. They barbarously devour those whom they should
protect, and, as unfaithful shepherds, fleece the flock they should
feed; nay, instead of feeding it, they feed upon it, [Eze
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#002.md). It is fit indeed that he who
feeds a flock should eat of the milk of the flock ([Co1
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#007).md), but that will not content them:
They eat the flesh of my people. It is fit that they should be clothed
with the wool, but that will not serve: They flay the skin from off
them, [Mic 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#003.md). By imposing heavier
taxes upon them than they can bear, and exacting them with rigour, by
mulcts, and fines, and corporal punishments, for pretended crimes, they
ruined the estates and families of their subjects, took away from some
their lives, from others their livelihoods, and were to their subjects
as beasts of prey, rather than shepherds. "They break their bones to
come at the marrow, and chop the flesh in pieces as for the pot." This
intimates that they were, (1.) Very ravenous and greedy for themselves,
indulging themselves in luxury and sensuality. (2.) Very barbarous and
cruel to those that were under them, not caring whom they beggared, so
they could but enrich themselves; such evil is the love of money the
root of.

3\. How they might expect that God should deal with them, since they had
been thus cruel to his subjects. The rule is fixed, Those shall have
judgment without mercy that have shown no mercy ([Mic
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#004).md): "They shall cry to the Lord, but
he will not hear them, in the day of their distress, as the poor cried
to them in the day of their prosperity and they would not hear them."
There will come a time when the most proud and scornful sinners will cry
to the Lord, and sue for that mercy which they once neither valued nor
copied out. But it will then be in vain; God will even hide his face
from them at that time, that time when they need his favour, and see
themselves undone without it. At another time they would have turned
their back upon him; but at that time he will turn his back upon them,
as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings. Note, Men cannot
expect to do ill and fare well, but may expect to find, as Adoni-bezek
did, that done to them which they did to others; for he is righteous who
takes vengeance. With the froward God will show himself froward, and he
often gives up cruel and unmerciful men into the hands of those who are
cruel and unmerciful to them, as they themselves have formerly been to
others. This agrees with [Pro 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#013.md),
Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he shall cry himself and
shall not be heard; but the merciful have reason to hope that they shall
obtain mercy.

II\. Let the prophets hear their charge too, and their doom; they were
such as prophesied falsely, and the princes bore rule by their means.
Observe,

1\. What was their sin. (1.) They made it their business to flatter and
deceive the people: They make my people err, lead them into mistakes,
both concerning what they should do and concerning what God would do
with them. It is ill with a people when their leaders cause them to err,
and those draw them out of the way that should guide them and go before
them in it. "They make them to err by crying peace, by telling them that
they do well, and that all shall be well with them; whereas they are in
the paths of sin, and within a step of ruin. They cry peace, but they
bite with their teeth," which perhaps is meant of their biting their own
lips, as we are apt to do when we would suppress something which we are
ready to speak. When they cried peace their own hearts gave them the
lie, and they were just ready to eat their own words and to contradict
themselves, but they bit with their teeth, and kept it in. They were not
blind leaders of the blind, for they saw the ditch before them, and yet
led their followers into it. (2.) They made it all their aim to glut
themselves, and serve their own belly, as the seducers in St. Paul's
time ([Rom 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#018).md), for their god is
their belly, [Phi 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019.md). They bite with
their teeth, and cry peace; that is, they will flatter and compliment
those that will feed them with good bits, will give them something to
eat; but as for those that put not into their mouths, that are not
continually cramming them, they look upon them as their enemies; to them
they do not cry peace, as they do to those whom they look upon as their
benefactors, but they even prepare war against them; against them they
denounce the judgments of God, but as they are to them, as the crafty
priests of the church of Rome, in some places, make their image either
to smile or frown upon the offerer according as his offering is. Justly
is it insisted on as a necessary qualification of a minister ([Ti1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#003.md), and again [Tit
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007).md) that he be not greedy of filthy
lucre.

2\. What is the sentence passed upon them for this sin, [Mic
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#006.md), [Mic
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#007). It is threatened, (1..md) That they
shall be involved in troubles and miseries with those to whom they had
cried peace: Night shall be upon them, a dark cold night of calamity,
such as they, in their flattery, led the people to hope would never
come. It shall be dark unto you, darker to you than to others; the sun
shall go down over the prophets, shall go down at noon; all comfort
shall depart from them, and they shall be deprived of all hope of it.
The day shall be dark over them, in which they promised themselves
light. Nor shall they be surrounded with outward troubles only, but
their mind shall be full of confusion, and they shall be brought to
their wits' end; their heads shall be clouded, and their own thoughts
shall trouble them; and that is trouble enough. They kept others in the
dark, and now God will bring them into the dark. (2.) That thereby they
shall be silenced, and all their pretensions to prophecy for ever
shamed. They never had any true vision; and now, the event disproving
their predictions of peace, it shall be made to appear that they never
had any, that there never was an answer of God to them, but it was all a
sham, and they were cheats and impostors. Their reputation being thus
quite sunk, their confidence would of course fail them. And, their
spirits being ruffled and confused, their invention would fail them too;
and by reason of this darkness, both without and within too, they shall
not divine, they shall not have so much as a counterfeit vision to
produce, they shall be ashamed, and confounded, and cover their lips, as
men that are quite baffled and have nothing to say for themselves. Note,
Those who deceive others are but preparing confusion for their own
faces.

[Micah 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 3:8</span></span>

Here, I. The prophet experiences a divine power going along with him in
his work, and he makes a solemn profession and protestation of it, as
that which would justify him, and bear him out, in his plain dealing
with the princes and rulers. He would not, he durst not, make thus bold
with the great men, but that he was carried out to do it by a
prophetical impulse and impression. It was not he that said it, but God
by him, and he could not but speak the word that God put into his mouth.
It comes in likewise by way of opposition to the false prophets, who
were full of shame when they lived to see themselves proved liars, and
who never had courage to deal faithfully with the people, but flattered
them in their sins; they were sensual, not having the Spirit, but truly
(says Micah) I am full of power by the Spirit of the Lord, [Mic
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#008.md). Having in himself an assurance of
the truth of what he said, he said it with assurance. Compare him with
those false prophets, and you will say, There is no comparison between
them. What is the chaff to the wheat? [Jer
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#028.md). What is painted fire to real
fire? Observe here, 1. What the qualifications were with which this
prophet was endured: He was full of power, and of judgment, and of
might; he had an ardent love to God and to the souls of men, a deep
concern for his glory and their salvation, and a flaming zeal against
sin. He had likewise courage to reprove it and witness against it, not
fearing the wrath either of great men or of great multitudes; whatever
difficulties or discouragements he met with, they did not deter him nor
drive him from his work; none of these things moved him. And all this
was guided by judgment and discretion; he was a man of wisdom as well as
courage; in all his preaching there was light as well as heat, and a
spirit of wisdom as well as of zeal. Thus was this man of God thoroughly
furnished for every good word he had to say, and every good work he had
to do. Those he preached to could not but perceive him to be full both
of power and judgment, for they found both their understandings opened
and their hearts made to burn within them, with such evidence and
demonstration, and with such power, did the word come from him. 2.
Whence he had these qualifications, not from and of himself, but he was
full of power by the Spirit of the Lord. Knowing that it was indeed the
Spirit of the Lord that was in him, and spoke by him, that it was a
divine revelation that he delivered, he spoke it boldly, and as one
having authority, set his face as a flint, knowing he should be
justified and borne out in what he said, [Isa
50:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007.md), [Isa
50:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#008.md). Note, Those who act honestly may
act boldly; and those who are sure that they have a commission from God
need not be afraid of opposition from men. Nay, he had not only a Spirit
of prophecy, which was the ground of his boldness, but the Spirit of
sanctification endued him with the boldness and wisdom which were
requisite for him. It was not in any strength of his own that he was
strong; for who is sufficient for these things? but in the Lord, and in
the power of his might; for from him all our sufficiency is. Are we full
of power at any time, for that which is good? It is purely by the Spirit
of the Lord, for of ourselves we are weak as water; it is the God of
Israel that gives strength and power both to his people and to his
ministers. 3. What use he made of these qualifications - this judgment
and this power; he declared to Jacob his transgression and to Israel his
sin. If transgression be found in Jacob and Israel, they must be told of
it, and it is the business of God's prophets to tell them of it, to cry
aloud and not to spare, [Isa 58:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001.md).
Those who come to hear the word of God must be willing to be told of
their faults, and must not only give their ministers leave to deal
plainly and faithfully with them, but take it kindly, and be thankful;
but, since few have meekness enough to receive reproof, those have need
of a great deal of boldness who are to give reproofs, and must pray for
a spirit both of wisdom and might.

II\. The prophet exerts this power in dealing with the heads of the
house of Jacob, both the princes and the prophets, whom he had drawn up
a high charge against in the former part of the chapter. He repeats the
summons of their attendance and attention ([Mic
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#009).md), the same that we had [Mic
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001.md), directing himself to the princes
of the house of Israel, yet he means those of Judah; for it appears
([Jer 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018.md), [Jer
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#019.md), where [Mic
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012) is quoted.md) that this was spoken
in Hezekiah's kingdom; but, the ten tribes being gone into captivity,
Judah is all that is now left of Jacob and Israel. The prophet speaks
respectfully to them (hear, I pray you) and gives them their titles of
heads and princes. Ministers must be faithful to great men in reproving
them for their sins, but they must not be rude and uncivil to them. Now
observe here,

1\. The great wickedness that these heads of the house of Jacob were
guilty of, princes, priest, and prophets; in short, they were covetous
and prostituted their offices to their love of money. (1.) The princes
abhorred all judgment; they would not be governed by any of its laws,
either in their own practice or in passing sentence upon appeals made to
them; they perverted all equity, and scorned to be under the direction
or correction of justice, when it could not be made pliable to their
secular interests. When, under pretence of doing right, they did the
most palpable wrongs, then they perverted equity, and made it serve a
purpose contrary to the intention of the founder of magistracy and
fountain of power. It is laid to their charge ([Mic
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#010).md) that they build up Zion with
blood. "They pretend, in justification of their extortion and
oppressions, that they build up Zion and Jerusalem; they add new streets
and squares to the holy cities, and adorn them; they establish and
advance the public interests both in church and state, and think that
therein they do God and Israel good service. But it is with blood and
with iniquity, and therefore it cannot prosper; nor will their
intentions of good to the city of God justify their contradictions to
the law of God." Those mistake who think that a burning zeal for holy
church, and the propagating of the faith, will serve to consecrate
robberies and murders, massacres and depredations; no, Zion's walls owe
those no thanks that build them up with blood and iniquity. The sin of
man works not the righteousness of God. "The office of the princes is to
judge upon appeals made to them; but they judge for reward ([Mic
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011).md); they give judgment on the side
of those that give the bribe; the most righteous cause shall not be
carried without a fee, and for a fee the most unrighteous cause shall be
carried." Miserable is the people's case when the judge's enquiry upon a
cause is not, "What is to be done in it?" but, "What is to be got by
it?" (2.) The priests' work was to teach the people, and for that the
law had provided them a very honourable comfortable maintenance; but
that will not content them, they teach for hire over and above, and will
be hired to teach any thing, as an oracle of God, which they know will
please and gain them an interest. (3.) The prophets, it should seem, had
honorary fees given them by way of gratuity ([Sa1
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#007.md), [Sa1
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#008).md); but these prophets governed
themselves in their prophesying by the prospect of temporal advantage
and that was the main thing they had in their eye: They divine for
money. Their tongues were mercenary; they would either prophesy or let
it alone, according as they found it most for their advantage; and a man
might have what oracle he would from them if he would but pay them for
it. Thus they were fit successors of Balaam, who loved the wages of
unrighteousness. Note, Though that which is wicked can never be
consecrated by a zeal for the church, yet that which is sacred may be,
and often is, desecrated, by the love of the world. When men do that
which in itself is good, but do it for filthy lucre, it loses its
excellency, and becomes an abomination both to God and man.

2\. Their vain presumption and carnal confidence, notwithstanding: They
lean upon the Lord, and because they are, in profession, his people,
they think there is neither harm nor danger in these their wicked
practices. Faith builds upon the Lord, rests in him, and relies upon
him, as the soul's foundation; presumption only leans upon the Lord as a
prop, makes use of him to serve a turn, while still the world is the
foundation that is built upon. They speak with a great deal of
confidence, (1.) Of their honour: "Is not the Lord among us? Have we not
the tokens of his presence with us, his temple, his ark, his lively
oracles?" They are haughty because of the holy mountain and its
dignities ([Zep 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#011).md), as if their
church-privileges would palliate the worst of practices, or as if God's
presence with them were intended to make the priests and people rich
with the sale of their performances. It was true that the Lord was among
them by his ordinances, and this puffed them up with pride; but, if they
imagined that he was among them by his favour and love, they were
mistaken: but it is a cheat the children of men often put upon
themselves to think they have God with them, when they have by their sin
provoked him to depart from them. (2.) They are confident of their own
safety: No evil can come upon us. Many are rocked asleep; in a fatal
security by their church-privileges, as if those would protect them in
sin, and shelter them from punishment, which are really, and will be,
the greatest aggravations both of their sin and of their punishment. If
men's having the Lord among them will not restrain them from doing evil,
it can never secure them from suffering evil for so doing; and it is
very absurd for sinners to think that their impudence will be their
impunity.

3\. The doom passed upon them for their real wickedness, notwithstanding
their imaginary protection ([Mic
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012).md): Therefore shall Zion for your
sake be ploughed as a field. This is that passage which is quoted as a
bold word spoken by Micah ([Jer
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018).md), which yet Hezekiah and his
princes took well, though in another reign it might have gone near to
cost him his head; nay, they repented and reformed, and so the execution
of this threatening was prevented, and did not come in those days. (1.)
It is the ruin of holy places that is here foretold, places that had
been highly honoured with the tokens of God's presence and the
performances of his worship; it is Zion that shall be ploughed as a
field, the building burnt to the ground and levelled with it. Some
observe that this was literally fulfilled in the destruction of
Jerusalem by the Romans, when the ground on which the city stood was
ploughed up in token of its utter desolation, and that no city should be
built upon that ground without the emperor's leave. Even Jerusalem, the
holy city, shall become heaps of ruins, and the mountain of the house,
on which the temple is built, shall be overgrown with briars and thorns,
as the high places of the forest. If sacred places be polluted by sin,
they must expect to be wasted and ruined by the judgments of God. (2.)
It is the wickedness of those who preside in them that brings the ruin:
"It is for your sake that Zion shall be ploughed as a field; you pretend
to build up Zion, but, doing it by blood and iniquity, you pull it
down." Note, The sin of priests and princes is often the ruin of states
and churches. Delirant reges, plectuntur Achivi - The kings act
foolishly and the people suffer for it.
