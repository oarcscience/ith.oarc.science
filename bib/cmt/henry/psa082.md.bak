### [Psalms Chapter 82](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 82:0</span></span>

This psalm is calculated for the meridian of princes' courts and courts
of justice, not in Israel only, but in other nations; yet it was
probably penned primarily for the use of the magistrates of Israel, the
great Sanhedrim, and their other elders who were in places of power, and
perhaps by David's direction. This psalm is designed to make kings wise,
and "to instruct the judges of the earth" (as [Psa
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001) and Ps. 10.md), to tell them their
duty as ([Sa2 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#003).md), and to tell them
of their faults as [Psa 58:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001.md). We have
here, I. The dignity of magistracy and its dependence upon God ([Psa
82:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001).md). II. The duty of magistrates
([Psa 82:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#003.md), [Psa
82:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#004).md). III. The degeneracy of bad
magistrates and the mischief they do ([Psa
82:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#002.md), [Psa
82:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#005).md). IV. Their doom read ([Psa
82:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006.md), [Psa
82:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#007).md). V. The desire and prayer of all
good people that the kingdom of God may be set up more and more ([Psa
82:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#008).md). Though magistrates may most
closely apply this psalm to themselves, yet we may any of us sing it
with understanding when we give glory to God, in singing it, as
presiding in all public affairs, providing for the protection of injured
innocency, and ready to punish the most powerful injustice, and when we
comfort ourselves with a belief of his present government and with the
hopes of his future judgment.

A psalm of Asaph.

[Psalms 82:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 82:1</span></span>

We have here,

I. God's supreme presidency and power in all councils and courts
asserted and laid down, as a great truth necessary to be believed both
by princes and subjects ([Psa 82:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001).md):
God stands, as chief director, in the congregation of the mighty, the
mighty One, in coetu fortis - in the councils of the prince, the supreme
magistrate, and he judges among the gods, the inferior magistrates; both
the legislative and the executive power of princes is under his eye and
his hand. Observe here, 1. The power and honour of magistrates; they are
the mighty. They are so in authority, for the public good (it is a great
power that they are entrusted with), and they ought to be so in wisdom
and courage. They are, in the Hebrew dialect, called gods; the same word
is used for these subordinate governors that is used for the sovereign
ruler of the world. They are elohim. Angels are so called both because
they are great in power and might and because God is pleased to make use
of their service in the government of this lower world; and magistrates
in an inferior capacity are likewise the ministers of his providence in
general, for the keeping up of order and peace in human societies, and
particularly of his justice and goodness in punishing evil-doers and
protecting those that do well. Good magistrates, who answer the ends of
magistracy, are as God; some of his honour is put upon them; they are
his viceregents, and great blessings to any people. A divine sentence is
in the lips of the king, [Pro 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#010.md).
But, as roaring lions and ranging bears, so are wicked rulers over the
poor people, [Pro 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#015.md). 2. A good
form and constitution of government intimated, and that is a mixed
monarchy like ours; here is the might one, the sovereign, and here is
his congregation, his privy-council, his parliament, his bench of
judges, who are called the gods. 3. God's incontestable sovereignty
maintained in and over all the congregations of the mighty. God stands,
he judges among them; they have their power from him and are accountable
to him. By him kings reign. He is present at all their debates, and
inspects all they say and do, and what is said and done amiss will be
called over again, and they reckoned with for their mal-administrations.
God has their hearts in his hands, and their tongues too, and he directs
them which way soever he will, [Pro
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#001.md). So that he has a negative voice
in all their resolves, and his counsels shall stand, whatever devices
are in men's hearts. He makes what use he pleases of them, and serves
his own purposes and designs by them; though their hearts little think
so, [Isa 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#007.md). Let magistrates
consider this and be awed by it; God is with them in the judgment, [Ch2
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#006.md); [Deu
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#017.md). Let subjects consider this and
be comforted with it; for good princes and good judges, who mean well,
are under a divine direction, and bad ones, who mean ever so ill, are
under a divine restraint.

II\. A charge given to all magistrates to do good with their power, as
they will answer it to him by whom they are entrusted with it, [Psa
82:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#003.md), [Psa
82:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#004.md). 1. They are to be the protectors
of those who lie exposed to injury and the patrons of those who want
advice and assistance: Defend the poor, who have no money wherewith to
make friends or fee counsel, and the fatherless, who, while they are
young and unable to help themselves, have lost those who would have been
the guides of their youth. Magistrates, as they must be fathers to their
country in general, so particularly to those in it who are fatherless.
Are they called gods? Herein they must be followers of him, they must be
fathers of the fatherless. Job was so, [Job
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#012.md). 2. They are to administer
justice impartially, and do right to the afflicted and needy, who, being
weak and helpless, have often wrongs done them; and will be in danger of
losing all if magistrates do not, ex officio - officially, interpose for
their relief. If a poor man has an honest cause, his poverty must be no
prejudice to his cause, how great and powerful soever those are that
contend with him. 3. They are to rescue those who have already fallen
into the hands of oppressors and deliver them. ([Psa
82:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#004).md): Rid them out of the hand of the
wicked. Avenge them of their adversary, [Luk
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#003.md). These are clients whom there is
nothing to be got by, no pay for serving them, no interest by obliging
them; yet these are those whom judges and magistrates must concern
themselves for, whose comfort they must consult and whose cause they
must espouse.

III\. A charge drawn up against bad magistrates, who neglect their duty
and abuse their power, forgetting that God standeth among them, [Psa
82:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#002.md), [Psa
82:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#005.md). Observe, 1. What the sin is they
are here charged with; they judge unjustly, contrary to the rules of
equity and the dictates of their consciences, giving judgment against
those who have right on their side, out of malice and ill-will, or for
those who have an unrighteous cause, out of favour and partial
affection. To do unjustly is bad, but to judge unjustly is much worse,
because it is doing wrong under colour of right; against such acts of
injustice there is least fence for the injured and by them encouragement
is given to the injurious. It was as great an evil as any Solomon saw
under the sun when he observed the place of judgment, that iniquity was
there, [Ecc 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016.md); [Isa
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#007.md). They not only accepted the
persons of the rich because they were rich, though that is bad enough,
but (which is much worse) they accepted the persons of the wicked
because they were wicked; they not only countenanced them in their
wickedness, but loved them the better for it, and fell in with their
interests. Woe unto thee, O land! when thy judges are such as these. 2.
What was the cause of this sin. They were told plainly enough that it
was their office and duty to protect and deliver the poor; it was many a
time given them in charge; yet they judge unjustly, for they know not,
neither will they understand. They do not care to hear their duty; they
will not take pains to study it; they have no desire to take things
right, but are governed by interest, not by reason or justice. A gift in
secret blinds their eyes. They know not because they will not
understand. None so blind as those that will not see. They have baffled
their own consciences, and so they walk on in darkness, not knowing nor
caring what they do nor whither they go. Those that walk on in darkness
are walking on to everlasting darkness. 3. What were the consequences of
this sin: All the foundations of the earth (or of the land) are out of
course. When justice is perverted what good can be expected? The earth
and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved, as the psalmist speaks in
a like case, [Psa 75:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#003.md). The
miscarriages of public persons are public mischiefs.

[Psalms 82:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 82:6</span></span>

We have here,

I. Earthly gods abased and brought down, [Psa
82:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006.md), [Psa
82:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#007.md). The dignity of their character
is acknowledged ([Psa 82:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006).md): I have
said, You are gods. They have been honoured with the name and title of
gods. God himself called them so in the statute against treasonable
words [Exo 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#028.md), Thou shalt not
revile the gods. And, if they have this style from the fountain of
honour, who can dispute it? But what is man, that he should be thus
magnified? He called them gods because unto them the word of God came,
so our Saviour expounds it ([Joh
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#035).md); they had a commission from
God, and were delegated and appointed by him to be the shields of the
earth, the conservators of the public peace, and revengers to execute
wrath upon those that disturb it, [Rom
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#004.md). All of them are in this sense
children of the Most High. God has put some of his honour upon them, and
employs them in his providential government of the world, as David made
his sons chief rulers. Or, "Because I said, You are gods, you have
carried the honour further than was intended and have imagined
yourselves to be the children of the Most High," as the king of Babylon
([Isa 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#014).md), I will be like the Most
High, and the king of Tyre ([Eze
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#002).md), Thou hast set thy heart as the
heart of God. It is a hard thing for men to have so much honour put upon
them by the hand of God, and so much honour paid them, as ought to be by
the children of men, and not to be proud of it and puffed up with it,
and so to think of themselves above what is meet. But here follows a
mortifying consideration: You shall die like men. This may be taken
either, 1. As the punishment of bad magistrates, such as judged
unjustly, and by their misrule put the foundations of the earth out of
course. God will reckon with them, and will cut them off in the midst of
their pomp and prosperity; they shall die like other wicked men, and
fall like one of the heathen princes (and their being Israelites shall
not secure them anymore than their being judges) or like one of the
angels that sinned, or like one of the giants of the old world. Compare
this with that which Elihu observed concerning the mighty oppressors in
his time. [Job 34:26](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#026.md), He striketh them
as wicked men in the open sight of others. Let those that abuse their
power know that God will take both it and their lives from them; for
wherein they deal proudly he will show himself above them. Or, 2. As the
period of the glory of all magistrates in this world. Let them not be
puffed up with their honour nor neglect their work, but let the
consideration of their mortality be both mortifying to their pride and
quickening to their duty. "You are called gods, but you have no patent
for immortality; you shall die like men, like common men; and like one
of them, you, O princes! shall fall." Note, Kings and princes, all the
judges of the earth, though they are gods to us, are men to God, and
shall die like men, and all their honour shall be laid in the dust. Mors
sceptra ligonibus aequat - Death mingles sceptres with spades.

II\. The God of heaven exalted and raised high, [Psa
82:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#008.md). The psalmist finds it to little
purpose to reason with these proud oppressors; they turned a deaf ear to
all he said and walked on in darkness; and therefore he looks up to God,
appeals to him, and begs of him to take unto himself his great power:
Arise, O God! judge the earth; and, when he prays that he would do it,
he believes that he will do it: Thou shalt inherit all nations. This has
respect, 1. To the kingdom of providence. God governs the world, sets up
and puts down whom he pleases; he inherits all nations, has an absolute
dominion over them, to dispose of them as a man does of his inheritance.
This we are to believe and to comfort ourselves with, that the earth is
not given so much into the hands of the wicked, the wicked rulers, as we
are tempted to think it is, [Job 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#024.md).
But God has reserved the power to himself and overrules them. In this
faith we must pray, "Arise, O God! judge the earth, appear against those
that judge unjustly, and set shepherds over thy people after thy own
heart." There is a righteous God to whom we may have recourse, and on
whom we may depend for the effectual relief of all that find themselves
aggrieved by unjust judges. 2. To the kingdom of the Messiah. It is a
prayer for the hastening of that, that Christ would come, who is to
judge the earth, and that promise is pleaded, that God shall give him
the heathen for his inheritance. Thou, O Christ! shalt inherit all
nations, and be the governor over them, [Psa
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008.md); [Psa
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#028.md). Let the second coming of Christ
set to-rights all these disorders. There are two words with which we may
comfort ourselves and one another in reference to the mismanagements of
power among men: one is [Rev 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#006.md),
Hallelujah, the Lord God omnipotent reigneth; the other is [Rev
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#020.md), Surely, I come quickly.
