### [Psalms Chapter 72](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 72:0</span></span>

The foregoing psalm was penned by David when he was old, and, it should
seem, so was this too; for Solomon was now standing fair for the crown;
that was his prayer for himself, this for his son and successor, and
with these two the prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended, as we
find in the close of this psalm. If we have but God's presence with us
while we live, and good hopes concerning those that shall come after us
that they shall be praising God on earth when we are praising him in
heaven, it is enough. This is entitled "a psalm for Solomon:" it is
probable that David dictated it, or, rather, that it was by the blessed
Spirit dictated to him, when, a little before he died, by divine
direction he settled the succession, and gave orders to proclaim Solomon
king, [Kg1 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#030.md), etc. But, though
Solomon's name is here made use of, Christ's kingdom is here prophesied
of under the type and figure of Solomon's. David knew what the divine
oracle was, That "of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he
would raise up Christ to sit on his throne," [Act
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#030.md). To him he here bears witness,
and with the prospect of the glories of his kingdom he comforted himself
in his dying moments when he foresaw that his house would not be so with
God, not so great not so good, as he wished. David, in spirit, I. Begins
with a short prayer for his successor ([Psa
72:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001).md). II. He passes immediately into
a long prediction of the glories of his reign (v. 2-17). And, III. He
concludes with praise to the God of Israel ([Psa
72:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#018).md). In singing this psalm we
must have an eye to Christ, praising him as a King, and pleasing
ourselves with our happiness as his subjects.

A psalm for Solomon.

[Psalms 72:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 72:1</span></span>

This verse is a prayer for the king, even the king's son.

I. We may apply it to Solomon: Give him thy judgments, O God! and thy
righteousness; make him a man, a king; make him a good man, a good king.
1. It is the prayer of a father for his child, a dying blessing, such as
the patriarchs bequeathed to their children. The best thing we can ask
of God for our children is that God will give them wisdom and grace to
know and do their duty; that is better than gold. Solomon learned to
pray for himself as his father had prayed for him, not that God would
give him riches and honour, but a wise and understanding heart. It was a
comfort to David that his own son was to be his successor, but more so
that he was likely to be both judicious and righteous. David had given
him a good education ([Pro 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#003).md), had
taught him good judgment and righteous, yet that would not do unless God
gave him his judgments. Parents cannot give grace to their children, but
may by prayer bring them to the God of grace, and shall not seek him in
vain, for their prayer shall either be answered or it shall return with
comfort into their own bosom. 2. It is the prayer of a king for his
successor. David had executed judgment and justice during his reign, and
now he prays that his son might do so too. Such a concern as this we
should have for posterity, desiring and endeavouring that those who come
after us may do God more and better service in their day than we have
done in ours. Those have little love either to God or man, and are of a
very narrow selfish spirit, who care not what becomes of the world and
the church when they are gone. 3. It is the prayer of subjects for their
king. It should seem, David penned this psalm for the use of the people,
that they, in singing, might pray for Solomon. Those who would live
quiet and peaceable lives must pray for kings and all in authority, that
God would give them his judgments and righteousness.

II\. We may apply it to Christ; not that he who intercedes for us needs
us to intercede for him; but, 1. It is a prayer of the Old Testament
church for sending the Messiah, as the church's King, King on the holy
hill of Zion, of whom the King of kings had said, Thou art my Son, [Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md), [Psa
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007.md). "Hasten his coming to whom all
judgment is committed;" and we must thus hasten the second coming of
Christ, when he shall judge the world in righteousness. 2. It is an
expression of the satisfaction which all true believers take in the
authority which the Lord Jesus has received from the Father: "Let him
have all power both in heaven and earth, and be the Lord our
righteousness; let him be the great trustee of divine grace for all that
are his; give it to him, that he may give it to us."

[Psalms 72:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 72:2</span></span>

This is a prophecy of the prosperity and perpetuity of the kingdom of
Christ under the shadow of the reign of Solomon. It comes in, 1. As a
plea to enforce the prayer: "Lord, give him thy judgments and thy
righteousness, and then he shall judge thy people with righteousness,
and so shall answer the end of his elevation, [Psa
72:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#002.md). Give him thy grace, and then thy
people, committed to his charge, will have the benefit of it." Because
God loved Israel, he made him king over them to do judgment and justice,
[Ch2 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#008.md). We may in faith wrestle with
God for that grace which we have reason to think will be of common
advantage to his church. 2. As an answer of peace to the prayer. As by
the prayer of faith we return answers to God's promises of mercy, so by
the promises of mercy God returns answers to our prayers of faith. That
this prophecy must refer to the kingdom of the Messiah is plain, because
there are many passages in it which cannot be applied to the reign of
Solomon. There was indeed a great deal of righteousness and peace, at
first, in the administration of his government; but, before the end of
his reign, there were both trouble and unrighteousness. The kingdom here
spoken of is to last as long as the sun, but Solomon's was soon extinct.
Therefore even the Jewish expositors understand it of the kingdom of the
Messiah.

Let us observe the many great and precious promises here made, which
were to have their full accomplishment only in the kingdom of Christ;
and yet some of them were in part fulfilled in Solomon's reign.

I. That it should be a righteous government ([Psa
72:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#002).md): He shall judge thy people with
righteousness. Compare [Isa 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004.md). All
the laws of Christ's kingdom are consonant to the eternal rules of
equity; the chancery it erects to relieve against the rigours of the
broken law is indeed a court of equity; and against the sentence of his
last judgment there will lie no exception. The peace of his kingdom
shall be supported by righteousness ([Psa
72:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003).md); for then only is the peace like
a river, when the righteousness is as the waves of the sea. The world
will be judged in righteousness, [Act
17:31](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#031.md).

II\. That it should be a peaceable government: The mountains shall bring
peace, and the little hills ([Psa
72:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003)); that is (says Dr. Hammond.md),
both the superior and the inferior courts of judicature in Solomon's
kingdom. There shall be abundance of peace, [Psa
72:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#007.md). Solomon's name signifies
peaceable, and such was his reign; for in it Israel enjoyed the
victories of the foregoing reign and preserved the tranquillity and
repose of that reign. But peace is, in a special manner, the glory of
Christ's kingdom; for, as far as it prevails, it reconciles men to God,
to themselves, and to one another, and slays all enmities; for he is our
peace.

III\. That the poor and needy should be, in a particular manner, taken
under the protection of this government: He shall judge thy poor, [Psa
72:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#002.md). Those are God's poor that are
impoverished by keeping a good conscience, and those shall be provided
for with a distinguishing care, shall be judged for with judgment, with
a particular cognizance taken of their case and a particular vengeance
taken for their wrongs. The poor of the people, and the children of the
needy, he will be sure so to judge as to save, [Psa
72:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#004.md). This is insisted upon again
([Psa 72:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#012.md), [Psa
72:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#013).md), intimating that Christ will be
sure to carry his cause on behalf of his injured poor. He will deliver
the needy that lie at the mercy of their oppressors, the poor also, both
because they have no helper and it is for his honour to help them and
because they cry unto him and he has promised, in answer to their
prayers, to help them; they by prayer commit themselves unto him, [Psa
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#014.md). He will spare the needy that
throw themselves on his mercy, and will not be rigorous and severe with
them; he will save their souls, and that is all they desire. Blessed are
the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Christ is the
poor man's King.

IV\. That proud oppressors shall be reckoned with: He shall break them
in pieces ([Psa 72:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#004).md), shall take away
their power to hurt, and punish them for all the mischief they have
done. This is the office of a good king, Parcere subjectis, et debellare
superbos - To spare the vanquished and debase the proud. The devil is
the great oppressor, whom Christ will break in pieces and of whose
kingdom he will be the destruction. With the breath of his mouth shall
he slay that wicked one ([Isa 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004).md),
and shall deliver the souls of his people from deceit and violence, [Psa
72:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#014.md). He shall save from the power of
Satan, both as an old serpent working by deceit to ensnare them and as a
roaring lion working by violence to terrify and devour them. So precious
shall their blood be unto him that not a drop of it shall be shed, by
the deceit or violence of Satan or his instruments, without being
reckoned for. Christ is a King, who, though he calls his subjects
sometimes to resist unto blood for him, yet is not prodigal of their
blood, nor will ever have it parted with but upon a valuable
consideration to his glory and theirs, and the filling up of the measure
of their enemies' iniquity.

V. That religion shall flourish under Christ's government ([Psa
72:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005).md): They shall fear thee as long as
the sun and moon endure. Solomon indeed built the temple, and the fear
and worship of God were well kept up, for some time, under his
government, but it did not last long; this therefore must point at
Christ's kingdom, all the subjects of which are brought to and kept in
the fear of God; for the Christian religion has a direct tendency to,
and a powerful influence upon, the support and advancement of natural
religion. Faith in Christ will set up, and keep up, the fear of God; and
therefore this is the everlasting gospel that is preached, Fear God, and
give honour to him, [Rev 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#007.md). And, as
Christ's government promotes devotion towards God, so it promotes both
justice and charity among men ([Psa
72:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#007).md): In his days shall the righteous
flourish; righteousness shall be practised, and those that practise
righteousness shall be preferred. Righteousness shall abound and be in
reputation, shall command and be in power. The law of Christ, written in
the heart, disposes men to be honest and just, and to render to all
their due; it likewise disposes men to live in love, and so it produces
abundance of peace and beats swords into ploughshares. Both holiness and
love shall be perpetual in Christ's kingdom, and shall never go to
decay, for the subjects of it shall fear God as long as the sun and moon
endure; Christianity, in the profession of it, having got footing in the
world, shall keep its ground till the end of time, and having, in the
power of it, got footing in the heart, it will continue there till, by
death, the sun, and the moon, and the stars (that is, the bodily senses)
are darkened. Through all the changes of the world, and all the changes
of life, Christ's kingdom will support itself; and, if the fear of God
continue as long as the sun and moon, abundance of peace will. The peace
of the church, the peace of the soul, shall run parallel with its purity
and piety, and last as long as these last.

VI\. That Christ's government shall be very comfortable to all his
faithful loving subjects ([Psa 72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006).md):
He shall, by the graces and comforts of his Spirit, come down like rain
upon the mown grass; not on that which is cut down, but that which is
left growing, that it may spring again, though it was beheaded. The
gospel of Christ distils as the rain, which softens the ground that was
hard, moistens that which was dry, and so makes it green and fruitful,
[Isa 55:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#010.md). Let our hearts drink in
the rain, [Heb 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#007.md).

VII\. That Christ's kingdom shall be extended very far, and greatly
enlarged; considering,

1\. The extent of his territories ([Psa
72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008).md): He shall have dominion from sea
to sea (from the South Sea to the North, or from the Red Sea to the
Mediterranean) and from the river Euphrates, or Nile, to the ends of the
earth. Solomon's dominion was very large ([Kg1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021).md), according to the promise, [Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md). But no sea, no river, is named,
that it might, by these proverbial expressions, intimate the universal
monarchy of the Lord Jesus. His gospel has been, or shall be, preached
to all nations ([Mat 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#014).md), and the
kingdoms of the world shall become his kingdoms ([Rev
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015).md) when the fulness of the
Gentiles shall be brought in. His territories shall be extended to those
countries, (1.) That were strangers to him: Those that dwell in the
wilderness, out of all high roads, that seldom hear news, shall hear the
glad tidings of the Redeemer and redemption by him, shall bow before
him, shall believe in him, accept of him, worship him, and take his yoke
upon them. Before the Lord Jesus we must all either bow or break; if we
break, we are ruined - if we bow, we are certainly made for ever. (2.)
That were enemies to him, and had fought against him: They shall lick
the dust; they shall be brought down and laid in the dust, shall bite
the ground for vexation, and be so hunger-bitten that they shall be glad
of dust, the serpent's meat ([Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015).md), for of his seed they are; and
over whom shall not he rule, when his enemies themselves are thus
humbled and brought low?

2\. The dignity of his tributaries. He shall not only reign over those
that dwell in the wilderness, the peasants and cottagers, but over those
that dwell in the palaces ([Psa
72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010).md): The kings of Tarshish, and of
the isles, that lie most remote from Israel and are the isles of the
Gentiles ([Gen 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#005).md), shall bring
presents to him as their sovereign Lord, by and under whom they hold
their crowns and all their crown lands. They shall court his favour, and
make an interest in him, that they may hear his wisdom. This was
literally fulfilled in Solomon (for all the kings of the earth sought
the wisdom of Solomon, and brought every man his present, [Ch2
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#023.md), [Ch2
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#024).md), and in Christ too, when the
wise men of the east, who probably were men of the first rank in their
own country, came to worship him and brought him presents, [Mat
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#011.md). They shall present themselves to
him; that is the best present we can bring to Christ, and without that
no other present is acceptable, [Rom
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md). They shall offer gifts,
spiritual sacrifices of prayer and praise, offer them to Christ as their
God, on Christ as their altar, which sanctifies every gift. Their
conversion to God is called the offering up, or sacrificing, of the
Gentiles, [Rom 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#016.md). Yea, all kings
shall, sooner or later, fall down before him, either to do their duty to
him or to receive their doom from him, [Psa
72:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#011.md). They shall fall before him,
either as his willing subjects or as his conquered captives, as
suppliants for his mercy or expectants of his judgment. And, when the
kings submit, the people come in of course: All nations shall serve him;
all shall be invited into his service; some of all nations shall come
into it, and in every nation incense shall be offered to him and a pure
offering, [Mal 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011.md); [Rev
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md).

VIII\. That he shall be honoured and beloved by all his subjects ([Psa
72:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015).md): He shall live; his subjects
shall desire his life (O king! live for ever) and with good reason; for
he has said, Because I live, you shall live also; and of him it is
witnessed that he liveth, ever liveth, making intercession, [Heb
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#008.md), [Heb
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#025.md). He shall live, and live
prosperously; and, 1. Presents shall be made to him. Though he shall be
able to live without them, for he needs neither the gifts nor the
services of any, yet to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba - gold,
the best of metals, gold of Sheba, which probably was the finest gold;
for he that is best must be served with the best. Those that have
abundance of the wealth of this world, that have gold at command, must
give it to Christ, must serve him with it, do good with it. Honour the
Lord with thy substance. 2. Prayers shall be made for him, and that
continually. The people prayed for Solomon, and that helped to make him
and his reign so great a blessing to them. It is the duty of subjects to
make prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, for kings and all in
authority, not in compliment to them, as is too often done, but in
concern for the public welfare. But how is this applied to Christ? He
needs not our prayers, nor can have any benefit by them. But the Old
Testament saints prayed for his coming, prayed continually for it; for
they called him, He that should come. And now that he has come we must
pray for the success of his gospel and the advancement of his kingdom,
which he calls praying for him (Hosanna to the Son of David, prosperity
to his reign), and we must pray for his second coming. It may be read,
Prayer shall be made through him, or for his sake; whatsoever we ask of
the Father shall be in his name and in dependence upon his intercession.
3. Praises shall be made of him, and high encomiums given of his wisdom,
justice, and goodness: Daily shall he be praised. By praying daily in
his name we give him honour. Subjects ought to speak well of the
government that is a blessing to them; and much more ought all
Christians to praise Jesus Christ, daily to praise him; for they owe
their all to him, and to him they lie under the highest obligations.

IX\. That under his government there shall be a wonderful increase both
of meat and mouths, both of the fruits of the earth in the country and
of the people inhabiting the cities, [Psa
72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016.md). 1. The country shall grow rich.
Sow but a handful of corn on the top of the mountains, whence one would
expect but little, and yet the fruit of it shall shake like Lebanon; it
shall come up like a wood, so thick, and tall, and strong, like the
cedars of Lebanon. Even upon the tops of the mountains the earth shall
bring forth by handfuls; that is an expression of great plenty ([Gen
41:47](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#047).md), as the grass upon the house
top is said to be that wherewith the mower fills not his hand. This is
applicable to the wonderful productions of the seed of the gospel in the
days of the Messiah. A handful of that seed, sown in the mountainous and
barren soil of the Gentile world, produced a wonderful harvest gathered
in to Christ, fruit that shook like Lebanon. The fields were white to
the harvest, [Joh 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#035.md); [Mat
9:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#037.md). The grain of mustard-seed grew
up to a great tree. 2. The towns shall grow populous: Those of the city
shall flourish like grass, for number, for verdure. The gospel church,
the city of God among men, shall have all the marks of prosperity, many
shall be added to it, and those that are shall be happy in it.

X. That his government shall be perpetual, both to his honour and to the
happiness of his subjects. The Lord Jesus shall reign for ever, and of
him only this must be understood, and not at all of Solomon. It is
Christ only that shall be feared throughout all generations ([Psa
72:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005).md) and as long as the sun and moon
endure, [Psa 72:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#007.md). 1. The honour of
the princes is immortal and shall never be sullied ([Psa
72:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017).md): His name shall endure for
ever, in spite of all the malicious attempts and endeavours of the
powers of darkness to eclipse the lustre of it and to cut off the line
of it; it shall be preserved; it shall be perpetuated; it shall be
propagated. As the names of earthly princes are continued in their
posterity, so Christ's in himself. Filiabitur nomen ejus - His name
shall descend to posterity. All nations, while the world stands, shall
call him blessed, shall bless God for him, continually speak well of
him, and think themselves happy in him. To the end of time, and to
eternity, his name shall be celebrated, shall be made use of; every
tongue shall confess it and every knee shall bow before it. 2. The
happiness of the people if universal too; it is complete and
everlasting: Men shall be blessed, truly and for ever blessed, in him.
This plainly refers to the promise made unto the fathers that in the
Messiah all the nations of the earth should be blessed. [Gen
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003.md).

[Psalms 72:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 72:18</span></span>

Such an illustrious prophecy as is in the foregoing verses of the
Messiah and his kingdom may fitly be concluded, as it is here, with
hearty prayers and praises.

I. The psalmist is here enlarged in thanksgivings for the prophecy and
promise, [Psa 72:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#018.md), [Psa
72:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#019.md). So sure is every word of God,
and with so much satisfaction may we rely upon it, that we have reason
enough to give thanks for what he has said, though it be not yet done.
We must own that for all the great things he has done for the world, for
the church, for the children of men, for his own children, in the
kingdom of providence, in the kingdom of grace, for all the power and
trust lodged in the hands of the Redeemer, God is worthy to be praised;
we must stir up ourselves and all that is within us to praise him after
the best manner, and desire that all others may do it. Blessed be the
Lord, that is, blessed be his glorious name; for it is only in his name
that we can contribute any thing to his glory and blessedness, and yet
that is also exalted above all blessing and praise. Let it be blessed
for ever, it shall be blessed for ever, it deserves to be blessed for
ever, and we hope to be for ever blessing it. We are here taught to
bless the name of Christ, and to bless God in Christ, for all that which
he has done for us by him. We must bless him, 1. As the Lord God, as a
self-existent self-sufficient Being, and our sovereign Lord. 2. As the
God of Israel, in covenant with that people and worshipped by them, and
who does this in performance of the truth unto Jacob and the mercy to
Abraham, 3. As the God who only does wondrous things, in creation and
providence, and especially this work of redemption, which excels them
all. Men's works are little, common, trifling things, and even these
they could not do without him. But God does all by his own power, and
they are wondrous things which he does, and such as will be the eternal
admiration of saints and angels.

II\. He is earnest in prayer for the accomplishment of this prophecy and
promise: Let the whole earth be filled with his glory, as it will be
when the kings of Tarshish, and the isles, shall bring presents to him.
It is sad to think how empty the earth is of the glory of God, how
little service and honour he has from a world to which he is such a
bountiful benefactor. All those, therefore, that wish well to the honour
of God and the welfare of mankind, cannot but desire that the earth may
be filled with the discoveries of his glory, suitably returned in
thankful acknowledgments of his glory. Let every heart, and every mouth,
and every assembly, be filled with the high praises of God. We shall see
how earnest David is in this prayer, and how much his heart is in it, if
we observe, 1. How he shuts up the prayer with a double seal: "Amen and
amen; again and again I say, I say it and let all others say the same,
so be it. Amen to my prayer; Amen to the prayers of all the saints to
this purport - Hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come." 2. How he ever
shuts up his life with this prayer, [Psa
72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020.md). This was the last psalm that
ever he penned, though not placed last in this collection; he penned it
when he lay on his death-bed, and with this he breathes his last: "Let
God be glorified, let the kingdom of the Messiah be set up, and kept up,
in the world, and I have enough, I desire no more. With this let the
prayers of David the son of Jesse be ended. Even so, come, Lord Jesus,
come quickly."
