### [Genesis Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

The foundation of all religion being laid in our relation to God as our
Creator, it was fit that the book of divine revelations which was
intended to be the guide, support, and rule, of religion in the world,
should begin, as it does, with a plain and full account of the creation
of the world - in answer to that first enquiry of a good conscience,
"Where is God my Maker?" ([Job 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#010).md).
Concerning this the pagan philosophers wretchedly blundered, and became
vain in their imaginations, some asserting the world's eternity and
self-existence, others ascribing it to a fortuitous concourse of atoms:
thus "the world by wisdom knew not God," but took a great deal of pains
to lose him. The holy scripture therefore, designing by revealed
religion to maintain and improve natural religion, to repair the decays
of it and supply the defects of it, since the fall, for the reviving of
the precepts of the law of nature, lays down, at first, this principle
of the unclouded light of nature, That this world was, in the beginning
of time, created by a Being of infinite wisdom and power, who was
himself before all time and all worlds. The entrance into God's word
gives this light, [Psa 119:130](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#130.md). The
first verse of the Bible gives us a surer and better, a more satisfying
and useful, knowledge of the origin of the universe, than all the
volumes of the philosophers. The lively faith of humble Christians
understands this matter better than the elevated fancy of the greatest
wits, [Heb 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#003.md).

We have three things in this chapter: - I. A general idea given us of
the work of creation ([Gen 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md), [Gen
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002).md). II. A particular account of the
several days' work, registered, as in a journal, distinctly and in
order. The creation of the light the first day ([Gen
1:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#003).md); of the firmament the second
day ([Gen 1:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#006).md); of the sea, the
earth, and its fruits, the third day ([Gen
1:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#009).md); of the lights of heaven the
fourth day ([Gen 1:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#014).md); of the fish
and fowl the fifth day ([Gen 1:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#020).md);
of the beasts ([Gen 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#024.md), [Gen
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#025).md); of man ([Gen
1:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026).md); and of food for both the
sixth day ([Gen 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#029.md), [Gen
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#030).md). III. The review and approbation
of the whole work ([Gen 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#031).md).

[Genesis 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 1:1</span></span>

In these verses we have the work of creation in its epitome and in its
embryo.

I. In its epitome, [Gen 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md), where we
find, to our comfort, the first article of our creed, that God the
Father Almighty is the Maker of heaven and earth, and as such we believe
in him.

1\. Observe, in this verse, four things: -

(1.) The effect produced - the heaven and the earth, that is, the world,
including the whole frame and furniture of the universe, the world and
all things therein, [Act 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#024.md). The
world is a great house, consisting of upper and lower stories, the
structure stately and magnificent, uniform and convenient, and every
room well and wisely furnished. It is the visible part of the creation
that Moses here designs to account for; therefore he mentions not the
creation of angels. But as the earth has not only its surface adorned
with grass and flowers, but also its bowels enriched with metals and
precious stones (which partake more of its solid nature and more
valuable, though the creation of them is not mentioned here), so the
heavens are not only beautified to our eye with glorious lamps which
garnish its outside, of whose creation we here read, but they are within
replenished with glorious beings, out of our sight, more celestial, and
more surpassing them in worth and excellency than the gold or sapphires
surpass the lilies of the field. In the visible world it is easy to
observe, \[1.\] Great variety, several sorts of beings vastly differing
in their nature and constitution from each other. Lord, how manifold are
thy works, and all good! \[2.\] Great beauty. The azure sky and verdant
earth are charming to the eye of the curious spectator, much more the
ornaments of both. How transcendent then must the beauty of the Creator
be! \[3.\] Great exactness and accuracy. To those that, with the help of
microscopes, narrowly look into the works of nature, they appear far
more fine than any of the works of art. \[4.\] Great power. It is not a
lump of dead and inactive matter, but there is virtue, more or less, in
every creature: the earth itself has a magnetic power. \[5.\] Great
order, a mutual dependence of beings, an exact harmony of motions, and
an admirable chain and connection of causes. \[6.\] Great mystery. There
are phenomena in nature which cannot be solved, secrets which cannot be
fathomed nor accounted for. But from what we see of heaven and earth we
may easily enough infer the eternal power and Godhead of the great
Creator, and may furnish ourselves with abundant matter for his praises.
And let our make and place, as men, remind us of our duty as Christians,
which is always to keep heaven in our eye and the earth under our feet.

(2.) The author and cause of this great work - God. The Hebrew word is
Elohim, which bespeaks, \[1.\] The power of God the Creator. El
signifies the strong God; and what less than almighty strength could
bring all things out of nothing? \[2.\] The plurality of persons in the
Godhead, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. This plural name of God, in
Hebrew, which speaks of him as many though he is one, was to the
Gentiles perhaps a savour of death unto death, hardening them in their
idolatry; but it is to us a savour of life unto life, confirming our
faith in the doctrine of the Trinity, which, though but darkly intimated
in the Old Testament, is clearly revealed in the New. The Son of God,
the eternal Word and Wisdom of the Father, was with him when he made the
world ([Pro 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#030).md), nay, we are often
told that the world was made by him, and nothing made without him, [Joh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003.md), [Joh
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010.md); [Eph
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009.md); [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md); [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md). O what high thoughts should this
form in our minds of that great God whom we draw nigh to in religious
worship, and that great Mediator in whose name we draw nigh!

(3.) The manner in which this work was effected: God created it, that
is, made it out of nothing. There was not any pre-existent matter out of
which the world was produced. The fish and fowl were indeed produced out
of the waters and the beasts and man out of the earth; but that earth
and those waters were made out of nothing. By the ordinary power of
nature, it is impossible that any thing should be made out of nothing;
no artificer can work, unless he has something to work on. But by the
almighty power of God it is not only possible that something should be
made of nothing (the God of nature is not subject to the laws of
nature), but in the creation it is impossible it should be otherwise,
for nothing is more injurious to the honour of the Eternal Mind than the
supposition of eternal matter. Thus the excellency of the power is of
God and all the glory is to him.

(4.) When this work was produced: In the beginning, that is, in the
beginning of time, when that clock was first set a going: time began
with the production of those beings that are measured by time. Before
the beginning of time there was none but that Infinite Being that
inhabits eternity. Should we ask why God made the world no sooner, we
should but darken counsel by words without knowledge; for how could
there be sooner or later in eternity? And he did make it in the
beginning of time, according to his eternal counsels before all time.
The Jewish Rabbies have a saying, that there were seven things which God
created before the world, by which they only mean to express the
excellency of these things: - The law, repentance, paradise, hell, the
throne of glory, the house of the sanctuary, and the name of the
Messiah. But to us it is enough to say, In the beginning was the Word,
[Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md).

2\. Let us learn hence, (1.) That atheism is folly, and atheists are the
greatest fools in nature; for they see there is a world that could not
make itself, and yet they will not own there is a God that made it.
Doubtless, they are without excuse, but the god of this world has
blinded their minds. (2.) That God is sovereign Lord of all by an
incontestable right. If he is the Creator, no doubt he is the owner and
possessor of heaven and earth. (3.) That with God all things are
possible, and therefore happy are the people that have him for their
God, and whose help and hope stand in his name, [Psa
121:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#002.md); [Psa
124:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#008). (4..md) That the God we serve is
worthy of, and yet is exalted far above, all blessing and praise, [Neh
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#005.md), [Neh
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#006.md). If he made the world, he needs
not our services, nor can be benefited by them ([Act
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#024.md), [Act
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#025).md), and yet he justly requires
them, and deserves our praise, [Rev
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#011.md). If all is of him, all must be to
him.

II\. Here is the work of creation in its embryo, [Gen
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002.md), where we have an account of the
first matter and the first mover.

1\. A chaos was the first matter. It is here called the earth (though
the earth, properly taken, was not made till the third day [Gen
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#010).md), because it did most resemble
that which afterwards was called earth, mere earth, destitute of its
ornaments, such a heavy unwieldy mass was it; it is also called the
deep, both for its vastness and because the waters which were afterwards
separated from the earth were now mixed with it. This immense mass of
matter was it out of which all bodies, even the firmament and visible
heavens themselves, were afterwards produced by the power of the Eternal
Word. The Creator could have made his work perfect at first, but by this
gradual proceeding he would show what is, ordinarily, the method of his
providence and grace. Observe the description of this chaos. (1.) There
was nothing in it desirable to be seen, for it was without form and
void. Toho and Bohu, confusion and emptiness; so these words are
rendered, [Isa 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011.md). It was
shapeless, it was useless, it was without inhabitants, without
ornaments, the shadow or rough draught of things to come, and not the
image of the things, [Heb 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md). The
earth is almost reduced to the same condition again by the sin of man,
under which the creation groans. See [Jer
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#023.md), I beheld the earth, and lo it
was without form, and void. To those who have their hearts in heaven
this lower world, in comparison with that upper, still appears to be
nothing but confusion and emptiness. There is no true beauty to be seen,
no satisfying fulness to be enjoyed, in this earth, but in God only.
(2.) If there had been any thing desirable to be seen, yet there was no
light to see it by; for darkness, thick darkness, was upon the face of
the deep. God did not create this darkness (as he is said to create the
darkness of affliction, [Isa 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#007).md),
for it was only the want of light, which yet could not be said to be
wanted till something was made that might be seen by it; nor needs the
want of it be much complained of, when there was nothing to be seen but
confusion and emptiness. If the work of grace in the soul is a new
creation, this chaos represents the state of an unregenerate graceless
soul: there is disorder, confusion, and every evil work; it is empty of
all good, for it is without God; it is dark, it is darkness itself. This
is our condition by nature, till almighty grace effects a blessed
change.

2\. The Spirit of God was the first mover: He moved upon the face of the
waters. When we consider the earth without form and void, methinks it is
like the valley full of dead and dry bones. Can these live? Can this
confused mass of matter be formed into a beautiful world? Yes, if a
spirit of life from God enter into it, [Eze
37:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#009.md). Now there is hope concerning
this thing; for the Spirit of God begins to work, and, if he work, who
or what shall hinder? God is said to make the world by his Spirit, [Psa
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#006.md); [Job
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#013.md); and by the same mighty worker
the new creation is effected. He moved upon the face of the deep, as
Elijah stretched himself upon the dead child, - as the hen gathers her
chickens under her wings, and hovers over them, to warm and cherish
them, [Mat 23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md), - as the eagle stirs
up her nest, and flutters over her young (it is the same world that is
here used), [Deu 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011.md). Learn hence,
That God is not only the author of all being, but the fountain of life
and spring of motion. Dead matter would be for ever dead if he did not
quicken it. And this makes it credible to us that God should raise the
dead. That power which brought such a world as this out of confusion,
emptiness, and darkness, at the beginning of time, can, at the end of
time, bring our vile bodies out of the grave, though it is a land of
darkness as darkness itself, and without any order ([Job
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#022).md), and can make them glorious
bodies.

[Genesis 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 1:3</span></span>

We have here a further account of the first day's work, in which
observe, 1. That the first of all visible beings which God created was
light; not that by it he himself might see to work (for the darkness and
light are both alike to him), but that by it we might see his works and
his glory in them, and might work our works while it is day. The works
of Satan and his servants are works of darkness; but he that doeth
truth, and doeth good, cometh to the light, and coveteth it, that his
deeds may be made manifest, [Joh 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021.md).
Light is the great beauty and blessing of the universe. Like the
first-born, it does, of all visible beings, most resemble its great
Parent in purity and power, brightness and beneficence; it is of great
affinity with a spirit, and is next to it; though by it we see other
things, and are sure that it is, yet we know not its nature, nor can
describe what it is, or by what way the light is parted, [Job
38:19](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#019.md), [Job
38:24](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#024.md). By the sight of it let us be
led to, and assisted in, the believing contemplation of him who is
light, infinite and eternal light ([Jo1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005).md), and the Father of lights ([Jam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017).md), and who dwells in inaccessible
light, [Ti1 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016.md). In the new creation,
the first thing wrought in the soul is light: the blessed Spirit
captives the will and affections by enlightening the understanding, so
coming into the heart by the door, like the good shepherd whose own the
sheep are, while sin and Satan, like thieves and robbers, climb up some
other way. Those that by sin were darkness by grace become light in the
world. 2. That the light was made by the word of God's power. He said,
Let there be light; he willed and appointed it, and it was done
immediately: there was light, such a copy as exactly answered the
original idea in the Eternal Mind. O the power of the word of God! He
spoke, and it was done, done really, effectually, and for perpetuity,
not in show only, and to serve a present turn, for he commanded, and it
stood fast: with him it was dictum, factum - a word, and a world. The
world of God (that is, his will and the good pleasure of it) is quick
and powerful. Christ is the Word, the essential eternal Word, and by him
the light was produced, for in him was light, and he is the true light,
the light of the world, [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md); [Joh
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#005.md). The divine light which shines in
sanctified souls is wrought by the power of God, the power of his word
and of the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, opening the understanding,
scattering the mists of ignorance and mistake, and giving the knowledge
of the glory of God in the face of Christ, as at first, God commanded
the light to shine out of darkness, [Co2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006.md). Darkness would have been
perpetually upon the face of fallen man if the Son of God had not come,
and given us an understanding, [Jo1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020.md). 3. That the light which God
willed, when it was produced, he approved of: God saw the light that it
was good. It was exactly as he designed it, and it was fit to answer the
end for which he designed it. It was useful and profitable; the world,
which now is a palace, would have been a dungeon without it. It was
amiable and pleasant. Truly the light is sweet ([Ecc
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#007).md); it rejoiceth the heart, [Pro
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#030.md). What God commands he will
approve and graciously accept; he will be well pleased with the work of
his own hands. That is good indeed which is so in the sight of God, for
he sees not as man sees. If the light is good, how good is he that is
the fountain of light, from whom we receive it, and to whom we owe all
praise for it and all the services we do by it! 4. That God divided the
light from the darkness, so put them asunder as that they could never be
joined together, or reconciled; for what fellowship has light with
darkness? [Co2 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#014.md). And yet he
divided time between them, the day for light and the night for darkness,
in a constant and regular succession to each other. Though the darkness
was now scattered by the light, yet it was not condemned to a perpetual
banishment, but takes its turn with the light, and has its place,
because it has its use; for, as the light of the morning befriends the
business of the day, so the shadows of the evening befriend the repose
of the night, and draw the curtains about us, that we may sleep the
better. See [Job 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#002.md). God has thus
divided time between light and darkness, because he would daily remind
us that this is a world of mixtures and changes. In heaven there is
perfect and perpetual light, and no darkness at all; in hell, utter
darkness, and no gleam of light. In that world between these two there
is a great gulf fixed; but, in this world, they are counterchanged, and
we pass daily from one to another, that we may learn to expect the like
vicissitudes in the providence of God, peace and trouble, joy and
sorrow, and may set the one over-against the other, accommodating
ourselves to both as we do to the light and darkness, bidding both
welcome, and making the best of both. 5. That God divided them from each
other by distinguishing names: He called the light day, and the darkness
he called night. He gave them names, as the Lord of both; for the day is
his, the night also is his, [Psa
74:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#016.md). He is the Lord of time, and
will be so, till day and night shall come to an end, and the stream of
time be swallowed up in the ocean of eternity. Let us acknowledge God in
the constant succession of day and night, and consecrate both to his
honour, by working for him every day and resting in him every night, and
meditating in his law day and night. 6. That this was the first day's
work, and a good day's work it was. The evening and the morning were the
first day. The darkness of the evening was before the light of the
morning, that it might serve for a foil to it, to set it off, and make
it shine the brighter. This was not only the first day of the world, but
the first day of the week. I observe it to the honour of that day,
because the new world began on the first day of the week likewise, in
the resurrection of Christ, as the light of the world, early in the
morning. In him the day-spring from on high has visited the world; and
happy are we, for ever happy, if that day-star arise in our hearts.

[Genesis 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 1:6</span></span>

We have here an account of the second day's work, the creation of the
firmament, in which observe, 1. The command of God concerning it: Let
there be a firmament, an expansion, so the Hebrew word signifies, like a
sheet spread, or a curtain drawn out. This includes all that is visible
above the earth, between it and the third heavens: the air, its higher,
middle, and lower, regions - the celestial globe, and all the spheres
and orbs of light above: it reaches as high as the place where the stars
are fixed, for that is called here the firmament of heaven ([Gen
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#014.md), [Gen
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#015).md), and as low as the place where
the birds fly, for that also is called the firmament of heaven, [Gen
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#020.md). When God had made the light, he
appointed the air to be the receptacle and vehicle of its beams, and to
be as a medium of communication between the invisible and the visible
world; for, though between heaven and earth there is an inconceivable
distance, yet there is not an impassable gulf, as there is between
heaven and hell. This firmament is not a wall of partition, but a way of
intercourse. See [Job 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#007.md); [Job
37:18](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#018.md); [Psa
104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003.md); [Amo
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#006.md). 2. The creation of it. Lest it
should seem as if God had only commanded it to be done, and some one
else had done it, he adds, And God made the firmament. What God requires
of us he himself works in us, or it is not done. He that commands faith,
holiness, and love, creates them by the power of his grace going along
with his word, that he may have all the praise. Lord, give what thou
commandest, and then command what thou pleasest. The firmament is said
to be the work of God's fingers, [Psa
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#003.md). Though the vastness of its extent
declares it to be the work of his arm stretched out, yet the admirable
fineness of its constitution shows that it is a curious piece of art,
the work of his fingers. 3. The use and design of it - to divide the
waters from the waters, that is, to distinguish between the waters that
are wrapped up in the clouds and those that cover the sea, the waters in
the air and those in the earth. See the difference between these two
carefully observed, [Deu 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#010.md), [Deu
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#011.md), where Canaan is upon this
account preferred to Egypt, that Egypt was moistened and made fruitful
with the waters that are under the firmament, but Canaan with waters
from above, out of the firmament, even the dew of heaven, which tarrieth
not for the sons of men, [Mic 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007.md). God
has, in the firmament of his power, chambers, store-chambers, whence he
watereth the earth, [Psa 104:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#013.md); [Psa
65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009.md), [Psa
65:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#010.md). He has also treasures, or
magazines, of snow and hail, which he hath reserved against the day of
battle and war, [Job 38:22](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#022.md), [Job
38:23](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#023.md). O what a great God is he who
has thus provided for the comfort of all that serve him and the
confusion of all that hate him! It is good having him our friend, and
bad having him our enemy. 4. The naming of it: He called the firmament
heaven. It is the visible heaven, the pavement of the holy city; above
the firmament God is said to have his throne ([Eze
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#026).md), for he has prepared it in the
heavens; the heavens therefore are said to rule, [Dan
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#026.md). Is not God in the height of
heaven? [Job 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#012.md). Yes, he is, and we
should be led by the contemplation of the heavens that are in our eye to
consider our Father who is in heaven. The height of the heavens should
remind us of God's supremacy and the infinite distance there is between
us and him; the brightness of the heavens and their purity should remind
us of his glory, and majesty, and perfect holiness; the vastness of the
heavens, their encompassing of the earth, and the influence they have
upon it, should remind us of his immensity and universal providence.

[Genesis 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 1:9</span></span>

The third day's work is related in these verses - the forming of the sea
and the dry land, and the making of the earth fruitful. Hitherto the
power of the Creator had been exerted and employed about the upper part
of the visible word; the light of heaven was kindled, and the firmament
of heaven fixed: but now he descends to this lower world, the earth,
which was designed for the children of men, designed both for their
habitation and for their maintenance; and here we have an account of the
fitting of it for both, and building of their house and the spreading of
their table. Observe,

I. How the earth was prepared to be a habitation for man, by the
gathering of the waters together, and the making of the dry land to
appear. Thus, instead of the confusion which there was ([Gen
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002).md) when earth and water were mixed
in one great mass, behold, now, there is order, by such a separation as
rendered them both useful. God said, Let it be so, and it was so; no
sooner said than done. 1. The waters which had covered the earth were
ordered to retire, and to gather into one place, namely, those hollows
which were fitted and appointed for their reception and rest. The
waters, thus cleared, thus collected, and thus lodged, in their proper
place, he called seas. Though they are many, in distant regions, and
washing several shores, yet, either above ground or under ground, they
have communication with each other, and so they are one, and the common
receptacle of waters, into which all the rivers flow, [Ecc
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#007.md). Waters and seas often, in
scripture, signify troubles and afflictions, [Psa
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007.md); [Psa
69:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#002.md), [Psa
69:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#014.md), [Psa
69:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#015.md). God's own people are not
exempted from these in this world; but it is their comfort that they are
only waters under the heaven (there are none in heaven), and that they
are all in the place that God has appointed them and within the bounds
that he has set for them. How the waters were gathered together at
first, and how they are still bound and limited by the same Almighty had
that first confined them, are elegantly described, [Psa
104:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#006.md), and are there mentioned as
matter of praise. Those that go down to the sea in ships ought to
acknowledge daily the wisdom, power, and goodness, of the Creator, in
making the great waters serviceable to man for trade and commerce; and
those that tarry at home must own themselves indebted to him that keeps
the sea with bars and doors in its decreed place, and stays its proud
waves, [Job 38:10](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#010.md), [Job
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#011.md). 2. The dry land was made to
appear, and emerge out of the waters, and was called earth, and given to
the children of men. The earth, it seems, was in being before; but it
was of no use, because it was under water. Thus many of God's gifts are
received in vain, because they are buried; make them to appear, and they
become serviceable. We who, to this day, enjoy the benefit of the dry
land (though, since this, it was once deluged, and dried again) must own
ourselves tenants to, and dependents upon, that God whose hands formed
the dry land, [Psa 95:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#005.md); [Jon
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#009.md).

II\. How the earth was furnished for the maintenance and support of man,
[Gen 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#011.md), [Gen
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#012.md). Present provision was now made,
by the immediate products of the upstart earth, which, in obedience to
God's command, was no sooner made than it became fruitful, and brought
forth grass for the cattle and herb for the service of man. Provision
was likewise made for time to come, by the perpetuating of the several
kinds of vegetables, which are numerous, various, and all curious, and
every one having its seed in itself after its kind, that, during the
continuance of man upon the earth, food might be fetched out of the
earth for his use and benefit. Lord, what is man, that he is thus
visited and regarded - that such care should be taken, and such
provision made, for the support and preservation of those guilty and
obnoxious lives which have been a thousand times forfeited! Observe
here, 1. That not only the earth is the Lord's, but the fulness thereof,
and he is the rightful owner and sovereign disposer, not only of it, but
of all its furniture. The earth was emptiness ([Gen
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002).md), but now, by a word's speaking,
it has become full of God's riches, and his they are still - his corn
and his wine, his wool and his flax, [Hos
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#009.md). Though the use of them is allowed
to us, the property still remains in him, and to his service and honour
they must be used. 2. That common providence is a continued creation,
and in it our Father worketh hitherto. The earth still remains under the
efficacy of this command, to bring forth grass, and herbs, and its
annual products; and though, being according to the common course of
nature, these are not standing miracles, yet they are standing instances
of the unwearied power and unexhausted goodness of the world's great
Maker and Master. 3. That though God, ordinarily, makes use of the
agency of second causes, according to their nature, yet he neither needs
them nor is tied to them; for, though the precious fruits of the earth
are usually brought forth by the influences of the sun and moon ([Deu
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#014).md), yet here we find the earth
bearing a great abundance of fruit, probable ripe fruit, before the sun
and moon were made. 4. That it is good to provide things necessary
before we have occasion to use them: before the beasts and man were
made, here were grass and herbs prepared for them. God thus dealt wisely
and graciously with man; let not man then be foolish and unwise for
himself. 5. That God must have the glory of all the benefit we receive
from the products of the earth, either for food or physic. It is he that
hears the heavens when they hear the earth, [Hos
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#021.md), [Hos
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#022.md). And if we have, through grace,
an interest in him who is the fountain, when the streams are dried up
and the fig-tree doth not blossom we may rejoice in him.

[Genesis 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 1:14</span></span>

This is the history of the fourth day's work, the creating of the sun,
moon, and stars, which are here accounted for, not as they are in
themselves and in their own nature, to satisfy the curious, but as they
are in relation to this earth, to which they serve as lights; and this
is enough to furnish us with matter for praise and thanksgiving. Holy
Job mentions this as an instance of the glorious power of God, that by
the Spirit he hath garnished the heavens ([Job
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#013).md); and here we have an account of
that garniture which is not only so much the beauty of the upper world,
but so much the blessing of this lower; for though heaven is high, yet
has it respect to this earth, and therefore should have respect from it.
Of the creation of the lights of heaven we have an account,

I. In general, [Gen 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#014.md), [Gen
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#015.md), where we have 1. The command
given concerning them: Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven.
God had said, Let there be light ([Gen
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#003).md), and there was light; but this
was, as it were, a chaos of light, scattered and confused: now it was
collected and modelled, and made into several luminaries, and so
rendered both more glorious and more serviceable. God is the God of
order, and not of confusion; and, as he is light, so he is the Father
and former of lights. Those lights were to be in the firmament of
heaven, that vast expanse which encloses the earth, and is conspicuous
to all; for no man, when he has lighted a candle, puts it under a
bushel, but on a candlestick ([Luk
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#016).md), and a stately golden
candlestick the firmament of heaven is, from which these candles give
light to all that are in the house. The firmament itself is spoken of as
having a brightness of its own ([Dan
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003).md), but this was not sufficient to
give light to the earth; and perhaps for this reason it is not expressly
said of the second day's work, in which the firmament was made, that it
was good, because, till it was adorned with these lights on the fourth
day, it had not become serviceable to man. 2. The use they were intended
to be of to this earth. (1.) They must be for the distinction of times,
of day and night, summer and winter, which are interchanged by the
motion of the sun, whose rising makes day, his setting night, his
approach towards our tropic summer, his recess to the other winter: and
thus, under the sun, there is a season to every purpose, [Ecc
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001). (2..md) They must be for the
direction of actions. They are for signs of the change of weather, that
the husbandman may order his affairs with discretion, foreseeing, by the
face of the sky, when second causes have begun to work, whether it will
be fair or foul, [Mat 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#002.md), [Mat
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#003.md). They do also give light upon the
earth, that we may walk ([Joh 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#009).md),
and work ([Joh 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#004).md), according as the
duty of every day requires. The lights of heaven do not shine for
themselves, nor for the world of spirits above, who need them not; but
they shine for us, for our pleasure and advantage. Lord, what is man,
that he should be thus regarded! [Psa
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#003.md), [Psa
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004.md). How ungrateful and inexcusable
are we, if, when God has set up these lights for us to work by, we
sleep, or play, or trifle away the time of business, and neglect the
great work we were sent into the world about! The lights of heaven are
made to serve us, and they do it faithfully, and shine in their season,
without fail: but we are set as lights in this world to serve God; and
do we in like manner answer the end of our creation? No, we do not, our
light does not shine before God as his lights shine before us, [Mat
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014.md). We burn our Master's candles,
but do not mind our Master's work.

II\. In particular, [Gen 1:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#016.md).

1\. Observe, The lights of heaven are the sun, moon, and stars; and all
these are the work of God's hands. (1.) The sun is the greatest light of
all, more than a million times greater than the earth, and the most
glorious and useful of all the lamps of heaven, a noble instance of the
Creator's wisdom, power, and goodness, and an invaluable blessing to the
creatures of this lower world. Let us learn from [Psa
19:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001.md) how to give unto God the glory
due unto his name, as the Maker of the sun. (2.) The moon is a less
light, and yet is here reckoned one of the greater lights, because
though, in regard to its magnitude and borrowed light, it is inferior to
many of the stars, yet, by virtue of its office, as ruler of the night,
and in respect of its usefulness to the earth, it is more excellent than
they. Those are most valuable that are most serviceable; and those are
the greater lights, not that have the best gifts, but that humbly and
faithfully do the most good with them. Whosoever will be great among
you, let him be your minister, [Mat
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#026). (3..md) He made the stars also,
which are here spoken of as they appear to vulgar eyes, without
distinguishing between the planets and the fixed stars, or accounting
for their number, nature, place, magnitude, motions, or influences; for
the scriptures were written, not to gratify our curiosity and make us
astronomers, but to lead us to God, and make us saints. Now these lights
are said to rule ([Gen 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#016.md), [Gen
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#018).md); not that they have a supreme
dominion, as God has, but they are deputy-governors, rulers under him.
Here the less light, the moon, is said to rule the night; but in [Psa
136:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#009.md) the stars are mentioned as
sharers in that government; The moon and stars to rule by night. No more
is meant than that they give light, [Jer
31:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#035.md). The best and most honourable
way of ruling is by giving light and doing good: those command respect
that live a useful life, and so shine as lights.

2\. Learn from all this, (1.) The sin and folly of that ancient
idolatry, the worshipping of the sun, moon, and stars, which, some
think, took rise, or countenance at least, from some broken traditions
in the patriarchal age concerning the rule and dominion of the lights of
heaven. But the account here given of them plainly shows that they are
both God's creatures and man's servants; and therefore it is both a
great affront to God and a great reproach to ourselves to make deities
of them and give them divine honours. See [Deu
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019). (2..md) The duty and wisdom of
daily worshipping that God who made all these things, and made them to
be that to us which they are. The revolutions of the day and night
oblige us to offer the solemn sacrifice of prayer and praise every
morning and evening.

[Genesis 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 1:20</span></span>

Each day, hitherto, has produced very noble and excellent beings, which
we can never sufficiently admire; but we do not read of the creation of
any living creature till the fifth day, of which these verses give us an
account. The work of creation not only proceeded gradually from one
thing to another, but rose and advanced gradually from that which was
less excellent to that which was more so, teaching us to press towards
perfection and endeavour that our last works may be our best works. It
was on the fifth day that the fish and fowl were created, and both out
of the waters. Though there is one kind of flesh of fishes, and another
of birds, yet they were made together, and both out of the waters; for
the power of the first Cause can produce very different effects from the
same second causes. Observe, 1. The making of the fish and fowl, at
first, [Gen 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#020.md), [Gen
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#021.md). God commanded them to be
produced. He said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly; not as if the
waters had any productive power of their own, but, "Let them be brought
into being, the fish in the waters and the fowl out of them." This
command he himself executed: God created great whales, etc. Insects,
which perhaps are as various and as numerous as any species of animals,
and their structure as curious, were part of this day's work, some of
them being allied to the fish and others to the fowl. Mr. Boyle (I
remember) says he admires the Creator's wisdom and power as much in an
ant as in an elephant. Notice is here taken of the various sorts of fish
and fowl, each after their kind, and of the great numbers of both that
were produced, for the waters brought forth abundantly; and particular
mention if made of great whales, the largest of fishes, whose bulk and
strength, exceeding that of any other animal, are remarkable proofs of
the power and greatness of the Creator. The express notice here taken of
the whale, above all the rest, seems sufficient to determine what animal
is meant by the Leviathan, [Job 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001.md).
The curious formation of the bodies of animals, their different sizes,
shapes, and natures, with the admirable powers of the sensitive life
with which they are endued, when duly considered, serve, not only to
silence and shame the objections of atheists and infidels, but to raise
high thoughts and high praises of God in pious and devout souls, [Psa
104:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#025.md), etc. 2. The blessing of them,
in order to their continuance. Life is a wasting thing. Its strength is
not the strength of stones. It is a candle that will burn out, if it be
not first blown out; and therefore the wise Creator not only made the
individuals, but provided for the propagation of the several kinds; God
blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, [Gen
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#022.md). God will bless his own works,
and not forsake them; and what he does shall be for a perpetuity, [Ecc
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#014.md). The power of God's providence
preserves all things, as at first his creating power produced them.
Fruitfulness is the effect of God's blessing and must be ascribed to it;
the multiplying of the fish and fowl, from year to year, is still the
fruit of this blessing. Well, let us give to God the glory of the
continuance of these creatures to this day for the benefit of man. See
[Job 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#007.md), [Job
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#009.md). It is a pity that fishing and
fowling, recreations innocent in themselves, should ever be abused to
divert any from God and their duty, while they are capable of being
improved to lead us to the contemplation of the wisdom, power, and
goodness, of him that made all these things, and to engage us to stand
in awe of him, as the fish and fowl do of us.

[Genesis 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 1:24</span></span>

We have here the first part of the sixth day's work. The sea was, the
day before, replenished with its fish, and the air with its fowl; and
this day were made the beasts of the earth, the cattle, and the creeping
things that pertain to the earth. Here, as before, 1. The Lord gave the
word; he said, Let the earth bring forth, not as if the earth had any
such prolific virtue as to produce these animals, or as if God resigned
his creating power to it; but, "Let these creatures now come into being
upon the earth, and out of it, in their respective kinds, conformable to
the ideas of them in the divine counsels concerning their creation." 2.
He also did the work; he made them all after their kind, not only of
divers shapes, but of divers natures, manners, food, and fashions - some
to be tame about the house, others to be wild in the fields - some
living upon grass and herbs, others upon flesh - some harmless, and
others ravenous - some bold, and others timorous - some for man's
service, and not his sustenance, as the horse - others for his
sustenance, and not his service, as the sheep - others for both, as the
ox - and some for neither, as the wild beasts. In all this appears the
manifold wisdom of the Creator.

[Genesis 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 1:26</span></span>

We have here the second part of the sixth day's work, the creation of
man, which we are, in a special manner, concerned to take notice of,
that we may know ourselves. Observe,

I. That man was made last of all the creatures, that it might not be
suspected that he had been, any way, a helper to God in the creation of
the world: that question must be for ever humbling and mortifying to
him, Where wast thou, or any of thy kind, when I laid the foundations of
the earth? [Job 38:4](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#004.md). Yet it was both
an honour and a favour to him that he was made last: an honour, for the
method of the creation was to advance from that which was less perfect
to that which was more so; and a favour, for it was not fit he should be
lodged in the palace designed for him till it was completely fitted up
and furnished for his reception. Man, as soon as he was made, had the
whole visible creation before him, both to contemplate and to take the
comfort of. Man was made the same day that the beasts were, because his
body was made of the same earth with theirs; and, while he is in the
body, he inhabits the same earth with them. God forbid that by indulging
the body and the desires of it we should make ourselves like the beasts
that perish!

II\. That man's creation was a more signal and immediate act of divine
wisdom and power than that of the other creatures. The narrative of it
is introduced with something of solemnity, and a manifest distinction
from the rest. Hitherto, it had been said, "Let there be light," and
"Let there be a firmament," and "Let the earth, or waters, bring forth"
such a thing; but now the word of command is turned into a word of
consultation, "Let us make man, for whose sake the rest of the creatures
were made: this is a work we must take into our own hands." In the
former he speaks as one having authority, in this as one having
affection; for his delights were with the sons of men, [Pro
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#031.md). It should seem as if this were
the work which he longed to be at; as if he had said, "Having at last
settled the preliminaries, let us now apply ourselves to the business,
Let us make man." Man was to be a creature different from all that had
been hitherto made. Flesh and spirit, heaven and earth, must be put
together in him, and he must be allied to both worlds. And therefore God
himself not only undertakes to make him, but is pleased so to express
himself as if he called a council to consider of the making of him: Let
us make man. The three persons of the Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, consult about it and concur in it, because man, when he was made,
was to be dedicated and devoted to Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Into that
great name we are, with good reason, baptized, for to that great name we
owe our being. Let him rule man who said, Let us make man.

III\. That man was made in God's image and after his likeness, two words
to express the same thing and making each other the more expressive;
image and likeness denote the likest image, the nearest resemblance of
any of the visible creatures. Man was not made in the likeness of any
creature that went before him, but in the likeness of his Creator; yet
still between God and man there is an infinite distance. Christ only is
the express image of God's person, as the Son of his Father, having the
same nature. It is only some of God's honour that is put upon man, who
is God's image only as the shadow in the glass, or the king's impress
upon the coin. God's image upon man consists in these three things: - 1.
In his nature and constitution, not those of his body (for God has not a
body), but those of his soul. This honour indeed God has put upon the
body of man, that the Word was made flesh, the Son of God was clothed
with a body like ours and will shortly clothe ours with a glory like
that of his. And this we may safely say, That he by whom God made the
worlds, not only the great world, but man the little world, formed the
human body, at the first, according to the platform he designed for
himself in the fulness of time. But it is the soul, the great soul, of
man, that does especially bear God's image. The soul is a spirit, an
intelligent immortal spirit, an influencing active spirit, herein
resembling God, the Father of Spirits, and the soul of the world. The
spirit of man is the candle of the Lord. The soul of man, considered in
its three noble faculties, understanding, will, and active power, is
perhaps the brightest clearest looking-glass in nature, wherein to see
God. 2. In his place and authority: Let us make man in our image, and
let him have dominion. As he has the government of the inferior
creatures, he is, as it were, God's representative, or viceroy, upon
earth; they are not capable of fearing and serving God, therefore God
has appointed them to fear and serve man. Yet his government of himself
by the freedom of his will has in it more of God's image than his
government of the creatures. 3. In his purity and rectitude. God's image
upon man consists in knowledge, righteousness, and true holiness, [Eph
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#024.md); [Col
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010.md). He was upright, [Ecc
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#029.md). He had an habitual conformity of
all his natural powers to the whole will of God. His understanding saw
divine things clearly and truly, and there were no errors nor mistakes
in his knowledge. His will complied readily and universally with the
will of God, without reluctancy or resistance. His affections were all
regular, and he had no inordinate appetites or passions. His thoughts
were easily brought and fixed to the best subjects, and there was no
vanity nor ungovernableness in them. All the inferior powers were
subject to the dictates and directions of the superior, without any
mutiny or rebellion. Thus holy, thus happy, were our first parents, in
having the image of God upon them. And this honour, put upon man at
first, is a good reason why we should not speak ill one of another ([Jam
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#009).md), nor do ill one to another ([Gen
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006).md), and a good reason why we should
not debase ourselves to the service of sin, and why we should devote
ourselves to God's service. But how art thou fallen, O son of the
morning! How is this image of God upon man defaced! How small are the
remains of it, and how great the ruins of it! The Lord renew it upon our
souls by his sanctifying grace!

IV\. That man was made male and female, and blessed with the blessing of
fruitfulness and increase. God said, Let us make man, and immediately it
follows, So God created man; he performed what he resolved. With us
saying and doing are two things; but they are not so with God. He
created him male and female, Adam and Eve - Adam first, out of earth,
and Eve out of his side, ch. 2. It should seem that of the rest of the
creatures God made many couples, but of man did not he make one? ([Mal
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#015).md), though he had the residue of
the Spirit, whence Christ gathers an argument against divorce, [Mat
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#004.md), [Mat
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#005.md). Our first father, Adam, was
confined to one wife; and, if he had put her away, there was no other
for him to marry, which plainly intimated that the bond of marriage was
not to be dissolved at pleasure. Angels were not made male and female,
for they were not to propagate their kind ([Luk
20:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#034).md); but man was made so, that
the nature might be propagated and the race continued. Fires and
candles, the luminaries of this lower world, because they waste, and go
out, have a power to light more; but it is not so with the lights of
heaven: stars do not kindle stars. God made but one male and one female,
that all the nations of men might know themselves to be made of one
blood, descendants from one common stock, and might thereby be induced
to love one another. God, having made them capable of transmitting the
nature they had received, said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and
replenish the earth. Here he gave them, 1. A large inheritance:
Replenish the earth; it is this that is bestowed upon the children of
men. They were made to dwell upon the face of all the earth, [Act
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#026.md). This is the place in which God
has set man to be the servant of his providence in the government of the
inferior creatures, and, as it were, the intelligence of this orb; to be
the receiver of God's bounty, which other creatures live upon, but do
not know it; to be likewise the collector of his praises in this lower
world, and to pay them into the exchequer above ([Psa
145:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#010).md); and, lastly, to be a
probationer for a better state. 2. A numerous lasting family, to enjoy
this inheritance, pronouncing a blessing upon them, in virtue of which
their posterity should extend to the utmost corners of the earth and
continue to the utmost period of time. Fruitfulness and increase depend
upon the blessing of God: Obed-edom had eight sons, for God blessed him,
[Ch1 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#005.md). It is owing to this
blessing, which God commanded at first, that the race of mankind is
still in being, and that as one generation passeth away another cometh.

V. That God gave to man, when he had made him, a dominion over the
inferior creatures, over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the
air. Though man provides for neither, he has power over both, much more
over every living thing that moveth upon the earth, which are more under
his care and within his reach. God designed hereby to put an honour upon
man, that he might find himself the more strongly obliged to bring
honour to his Maker. This dominion is very much diminished and lost by
the fall; yet God's providence continues so much of it to the children
of men as is necessary to the safety and support of their lives, and
God's grace has given to the saints a new and better title to the
creature than that which was forfeited by sin; for all is ours if we are
Christ's, [Co1 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#022.md).

We have here the third part of the sixth day's work, which was not any
new creation, but a gracious provision of food for all flesh, [Psa
136:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#025.md). He that made man and beast
thus took care to preserve both, [Psa
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#006.md). Here is,

I. Food provided for man, [Gen 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#029.md).
Herbs and fruits must be his meat, including corn and all the products
of the earth; these were allowed him, but (it should seem) not flesh,
till after the flood, [Gen 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#003.md). And
before the earth was deluged, much more before it was cursed for man's
sake, its fruits, no doubt, were more pleasing to the taste and more
strengthening and nourishing to the body than marrow and fatness, and
all the portion of the king's meat, are now. See here, 1. That which
should make us humble. As we were made out of the earth, so we are
maintained out of it. Once indeed men did eat angels' food, bread from
heaven; but they died ([Joh 6:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#049).md); it
was to them but as food out of the earth, [Psa
104:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#014.md). There is meat that endures to
everlasting life; the Lord evermore give us this. 2. That which should
make us thankful. The Lord is for the body; from him we receive all the
supports and comforts of this life, and to him we must give thanks. He
gives us all things richly to enjoy, not only for necessity, but plenty,
plenty, dainties, and varieties, for ornament and delight. How much are
we indebted! How careful should we be, as we live upon God's bounty, to
live to his glory! 3. That which should make us temperate and content
with our lot. Though Adam had dominion given him over fish and fowl, yet
God confined him, in his food, to herbs and fruits; and he never
complained of it. Though afterwards he coveted forbidden fruit, for the
sake of the wisdom and knowledge he promised himself from it, yet we
never read that he coveted forbidden flesh. If God give us food for our
lives, let us not, with murmuring Israel, ask food for our lusts, [Psa
78:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#018.md); see [Dan
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#015.md).

II\. Food provided for the beasts, [Gen
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#030.md). Doth God take care for oxen?
Yes, certainly, he provides food convenient for them, and not for oxen
only, which were used in his sacrifices and man's service, but even the
young lions and the young ravens are the care of his providence; they
ask and have their meat from God. Let us give to God the glory of his
bounty to the inferior creatures, that all are fed, as it were, at his
table, every day. He is a great housekeeper, a very rich and bountiful
one, that satisfies the desire of every living thing. Let this encourage
God's people to cast their care upon him, and not to be solicitous
respecting what they shall eat and what they shall drink. He that
provided for Adam without his care, and still provides for all the
creatures without their care, will not let those that trust him want any
good thing, [Mat 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#026.md). He that feeds
his birds will not starve his babes.

[Genesis 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 1:31</span></span>

We have here the approbation and conclusion of the whole work of
creation. As for God, his work is perfect; and if he begin he will also
make an end, in providence and grace, as well as here in creation.
Observe,

I. The review God took of his work: He saw every thing that he had made.
So he does still; all the works of his hands are under his eye. He that
made all sees all; he that made us sees us, Ps. 139:1-16. Omniscience
cannot be separated from omnipotence. Known unto God are all his works,
[Act 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#018.md). But this was the Eternal
Mind's solemn reflection upon the copies of its own wisdom and the
products of its own power. God has hereby set us an example of reviewing
our works. Having given us a power of reflection, he expects we should
use that power, see our way ([Jer
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#023).md), and think of it, [Psa
119:59](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#059.md). When we have finished a day's
work, and are entering upon the rest of the night, we should commune
with our own hearts about what we have been doing that day; so likewise
when we have finished a week's work, and are entering upon the
sabbath-rest, we should thus prepare to meet our God; and when we are
finishing our life's work, and are entering upon our rest in the grave,
that is a time to bring to remembrance, that we may die repenting, and
so take leave of it.

II\. The complacency God took in his work. When we come to review our
works we find, to our shame, that much has been very bad; but, when God
reviewed his, all was very good. He did not pronounce it good till he
had seen it so, to teach us not to answer a matter before we hear it.
The work of creation was a very good work. All that God made was
well-made, and there was no flaw nor defect in it. 1. It was good. Good,
for it is all agreeable to the mind of the Creator, just as he would
have it to be; when the transcript came to be compared with the great
original, it was found to be exact, no errata in it, not one misplaced
stroke. Good, for it answers the end of its creation, and is fit for the
purpose for which it was designed. Good, for it is serviceable to man,
whom God had appointed lord of the visible creation. Good, for it is all
for God's glory; there is that in the whole visible creation which is a
demonstration of God's being and perfections, and which tends to beget,
in the soul of man, a religious regard to him and veneration of him. 2.
It was very good. Of each day's work (except the second) it was said
that it was good, but now, it is very good. For, (1.) Now man was made,
who was the chief of the ways of God, who was designed to be the visible
image of the Creator's glory and the mouth of the creation in his
praises. (2.) Now all was made; every part was good, but all together
very good. The glory and goodness, the beauty and harmony, of God's
works, both of providence and grace, as this of creation, will best
appear when they are perfected. When the top-stone is brought forth we
shall cry, Grace, grace, unto it, [Zac
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#007.md). Therefore judge nothing before
the time.

III\. The time when this work was concluded: The evening and the morning
were the sixth day; so that in six days God made the world. We are not
to think but that God could have made the world in an instant. He said
that, Let there be light, and there was light, could have said, "Let
there be a world," and there would have been a world, in a moment, in
the twinkling of an eye, as at the resurrection, [Co1
15:52](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#052.md). But he did it in six days, that
he might show himself a free-agent, doing his own work both in his own
way and in his own time, - that his wisdom, power, and goodness, might
appear to us, and be meditated upon by us, the more distinctly, - and
that he might set us an example of working six days and resting the
seventh; it is therefore made the reason of the fourth commandment. So
much would the sabbath conduce to the keeping up of religion in the
world that God had an eye to it in the timing of his creation. And now,
as God reviewed his work, let us review our meditations upon it, and we
shall find them very lame and defective, and our praises low and flat;
let us therefore stir up ourselves, and all that is within us, to
worship him that made the heaven, earth, and sea, and the fountains of
waters, according to the tenour of the everlasting gospel, which is
preached to every nation, [Rev 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006.md),
[Rev 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#007.md). All his works, in all
places of his dominion, do bless him; and, therefore, bless thou the
Lord, O my soul!
