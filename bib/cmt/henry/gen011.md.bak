### [Genesis Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 11:0</span></span>

The old distinction between the sons of God and the sons of men
(professors and profane) survived the flood, and now appeared again,
when men began to multiply: according to this distinction we have, in
this chapter, I. The dispersion of the sons of men at Babel ([Gen
11:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#001).md), where we have, 1. Their
presumptuous provoking design, which was to build a city and a tower
([Gen 11:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#001).md). 2. The righteous
judgment of God upon them in disappointing their design, by confounding
their language, and so scattering them ([Gen
11:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#005).md). II. The pedigree of the sons
of God down to Abraham (v. 10-26), with a general account of his family,
and removal out of his native country ([Gen
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#027), etc..md).

[Genesis 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 11:1</span></span>

The close of the foregoing chapter tells us that by the sons of Noah, or
among the sons of Noah, the nations were divided in the earth after the
flood, that is, were distinguished into several tribes or colonies; and,
the places having grown too strait for them, it was either appointed by
Noah, or agreed upon among his sons, which way each several tribe or
colony should steer its course, beginning with the countries that were
next them, and designing to proceed further and further, and to remove
to a greater distance from each other, as the increase of their several
companies should require. Thus was the matter well settled, one hundred
years after the flood, about the time of Peleg's birth; but the sons of
men, it should seem, were loth to disperse into distant places; they
thought the more the merrier and the safer, and therefore they contrived
to keep together, and were slack to go to possess the land which the
Lord God of their fathers had given them ([Jos
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#003).md), thinking themselves wiser than
either God or Noah. Now here we have,

I. The advantages which befriended their design of keeping together, 1.
They were all of one language, [Gen
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#001.md). If there were any different
languages before the flood, yet Noah's only, which it is likely was the
same with Adam's, was preserved through the flood, and continued after
it. Now, while they all understood one another, they would be the more
likely to love one another, and the more capable of helping one another,
and the less inclinable to separate one from another. 2. They found a
very convenient commodious place to settle in ([Gen
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#002).md), a plain in the land of Shinar,
a spacious plain, able to contain them all, and a fruitful plain, able,
according as their present numbers were, to support them all, though
perhaps they had not considered what room there would be for them when
their numbers should be increased. Note, Inviting accommodations, for
the present, often prove too strong temptations to the neglect of both
duty and interest, as it respects futurity.

II\. The method they took to bind themselves to one another, and to
settle together in one body. Instead of coveting to enlarge their
borders by a peaceful departure under the divine protection, they
contrived to fortify them, and, as those that were resolved to wage war
with Heaven, they put themselves into a posture of defence. Their
unanimous resolution is, Let us build ourselves a city and a tower. It
is observable that the first builders of cities, both in the old world
([Gen 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#017).md), and in the new world
here, were not men of the best character and reputation: tents served
God's subjects to dwell in; cities were first built by those that were
rebels against him and revolters from him. Observe here,

1\. How they excited and encouraged one another to set about this work.
They said, Go to, let us make brick ([Gen
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#003).md), and again, ([Gen
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#004).md), Go to, let us build ourselves a
city; by mutual excitements they made one another more daring and
resolute. Note, Great things may be brought to pass when the undertakers
are numerous and unanimous, and stir up one another. Let us learn to
provoke one another to love and to good works, as sinners stir up and
encourage one another to wicked works. See [Psa
122:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001.md); [Isa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003.md), [Isa
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#005.md); [Jer
50:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#005.md).

2\. What materials they used in their building. The country, being
plain, yielded neither stone nor mortar, yet this did not discourage
them from their undertaking, but they made brick to serve instead of
stone, and slime or pitch instead of mortar. See here, (1.) What shift
those will make that are resolute in their purposes: were we but
zealously affected in a good thing, we should not stop our work so often
as we do, under pretence that we want conveniences for carrying it on.
(2.) What a difference there is between men's building and God's; when
men build their Babel, brick and slime are their best materials; but,
when God builds his Jerusalem, he lays even the foundations of it with
sapphires, and all its borders with pleasant stones, [Isa
54:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#011.md), [Isa
54:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#012.md); [Rev
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#019.md).

3\. For what ends they built. Some think they intended hereby to secure
themselves against the waters of another flood. God had told them indeed
that he would not again drown the world; but they would trust to a tower
of their own making, rather than to a promise of God's making or an ark
of his appointing. If, however, they had had this in their eye, they
would have chosen to build their tower upon a mountain rather than upon
a plain, but three things, it seems, they aimed at in building this
tower: -

(1.) It seems designed for an affront to God himself; for they would
build a tower whose top might reach to heaven, which bespeaks a defiance
of God, or at least a rivalship with him. They would be like the Most
High, or would come as near him as they could, not in holiness but in
height. They forgot their place, and, scorning to creep on the earth,
resolved to climb to heaven, not by the door or ladder, but some other
way.

(2.) They hoped hereby to make themselves a name; they would do
something to be talked of now, and to give posterity to know that there
had been such men as they in the world. Rather than die and leave no
memorandum behind them, they would leave this monument of their pride,
and ambition, and folly. Note, \[1.\] Affectation of honour and a name
among men commonly inspires with a strange ardour for great and
difficult undertakings, and often betrays to that which is evil and
offensive to God. \[2.\] It is just with God to bury those names in the
dust which are raised by sin. These Babel-builders put themselves to a
great deal of foolish expense to make themselves a name; but they could
not gain even this point, for we do not find in any history the name of
so much as one of these Babel-builders. Philo Judaeus says, They
engraved every one his name upon a brick, in perpetuam rei memoriam - as
a perpetual memorial; yet neither did this serve their purpose.

(3.) They did it to prevent their dispersion: Lest we be scattered
abroad upon the face of the earth. "It was done" (says Josephus) "in
disobedience to that command ([Gen
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001).md), Replenish the earth." God orders
them to disperse. "No," say they, "we will not, we will live and die
together." In order hereunto, they engage themselves and one another in
this vast undertaking. That they might unite in one glorious empire,
they resolve to build this city and tower, to be the metropolis of their
kingdom and the centre of their unity. It is probable that the band of
ambitious Nimrod was in all this. He could not content himself with the
command of a particular colony, but aimed at universal monarchy, in
order to which, under pretence of uniting for their common safety, he
contrives to keep them in one body, that, having them all under his eye,
he might not fail to have them under his power. See the daring
presumption of these sinners. Here is, \[1.\] A bold opposition to God:
"You shall be scattered," says God. "But we will not," say they. Woe
unto him that thus strives with his maker. \[2.\] A bold competition
with God. It is God's prerogative to be universal monarch, Lord of all,
and King of kings; the man that aims at it offers to step into the
throne of God, who will not give his glory to another.

[Genesis 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 11:5</span></span>

We have here the quashing of the project of the Babel-builders, and the
turning of the counsel of those froward men headlong, that God's counsel
might stand in spite of them. Here is,

I. The cognizance God took of the design that was on foot: The Lord came
down to see the city, [Gen 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#005.md). It is
an expression after the manner of men; he knew it as clearly and fully
as men know that which they come to the place to view. Observe, 1.
Before he gave judgment upon their cause, he enquired into it; for God
is incontestably just and fair in all his proceedings against sin and
sinners, and condemns none unheard. 2. It is spoken of an act of
condescension in God to take notice even of this building, which the
undertakers were so proud of ; for he humbles himself to behold the
transactions, even the most considerable ones, of this lower world, [Psa
113:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#006.md). 3. It is said to be the tower
which the children of men built, which intimates, (1.) Their weakness
and frailty as men. It was a very foolish thing for the children of men,
worms of the earth, to defy Heaven, and to provoke the Lord to jealousy.
Are they stronger than he? (2.) Their sinfulness and obnoxiousness. They
were the sons of Adam, so it is in the Hebrew; nay, of that Adam, that
sinful disobedient Adam, whose children are by nature children of
disobedience, children that are corrupters. (3.) Their distinction from
the children of God, the professors of religion, from whom these daring
builders had separated themselves, and built this tower to support and
perpetuate the separation. Pious Eber is not found among this ungodly
crew; for he and his are called the children of God, and therefore their
souls come not into the secret, nor unite themselves to the assembly, of
these children of men.

II\. The counsels and resolves of the Eternal God concerning this
matter; he did not come down merely as a spectator, but as a judge, as a
prince, to look upon these proud men, and abase them, [Job
40:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#011.md). Observe,

1\. He suffered them to proceed a good way in their enterprise before he
put a stop to it, that they might have space to repent, and, if they had
so much consideration left, might be ashamed of it and weary of it
themselves; and if not that their disappointment might be the more
shameful, and every one that passed by might laugh at them, saying,
These men began to build, and were not able to finish, that so the works
of their hands, from which they promised themselves immortal honour,
might turn to their perpetual reproach. Note, God has wise and holy ends
in permitting the enemies of his glory to carry on their impious
projects a great way, and to prosper long in their enterprises.

2\. When they had, with much care and toil, made some considerable
progress in their building, then God determined to break their measures
and disperse them. Observe,

(1.) The righteousness of God, which appears in the considerations upon
which he proceeded in this resolution, [Gen
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#006.md). Two things he considered: -
\[1.\] Their oneness, as a reason why they must be scattered: "Behold,
the people are one, and they have all one language. If they continue
one, much of the earth will be left uninhabited; the power of their
prince will soon be exorbitant; wickedness and profaneness will be
insufferably rampant, for they will strengthen one another's hands in
it; and, which is worst of all, there will be an overbalance to the
church, and these children of men, if thus incorporated, will swallow up
the little remnant of God's children." Therefore it is decreed that they
must not be one. Note, Unity is a policy but it is not the infallible
mark of a true church; yet, while the builders of Babel, though of
different families, dispositions, and interests, were thus unanimous in
opposing God, what a pity is it, and what a shame, that the builders of
Sion, though united in one common head and Spirit, should be divided, as
they are, in serving God! But marvel not at the matter. Christ came not
to send peace. \[2.\] Their obstinacy: Now nothing will be restrained
from them; and this is a reason why they must be crossed and thwarted in
their design. God had tried, by his commands and admonitions, to bring
them off from this project, but in vain; therefore he must take another
course with them. See here, First, The sinfulness of sin, and the
wilfulness of sinners; ever since Adam would not be restrained from the
forbidden tree, his unsanctified seed have been impatient of restraint
and ready to rebel against it. Secondly, See the necessity of God's
judgments upon earth, to keep the world in some order and to tie the
hands of those that will not be checked by law.

(2.) The wisdom and mercy of God in the methods that were taken for the
defeating of this enterprise ([Gen
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#007).md): Go to, let us go down, and
there confound their language. This was not spoken to the angels, as if
God needed either their advice or their assistance, but God speaks it to
himself, or the Father to the Son and Holy Ghost. They said, Go to, let
us make brick, and Go to, let us build a tower, animating one another to
the attempt; and now God says, Go to, let us confound their language;
for, if men stir up themselves to sin, God will stir up himself to take
vengeance, [Isa 59:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#017.md), [Isa
59:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#018.md). Now observe here, \[1.\] The
mercy of God, in moderating the penalty, and not making it
proportionable to the offence; for he deals not with us according to our
sins. He does not say, "Let us go down now in thunder and lightning, and
consume those rebels in a moment;" or, "Let the earth open, and swallow
up them and their building, and let those go down quickly into hell who
are climbing to heaven the wrong way." No; only, "Let us go down, and
scatter them." They deserved death, but are only banished or
transported; for the patience of God is very great towards a provoking
world. Punishments are chiefly reserved for the future state. God's
judgments on sinners in this life, compared with those which are
reserved, are little more than restraints. \[2.\] The wisdom of God, in
pitching upon an effectual expedient to stay proceedings, which was the
confounding of their language, that they might not understand one
another's speech, nor could they well join hands when their tongues were
divided; so that this would be a very proper method both for taking them
off from their building (for, if they could not understand one another,
they could not help one another) and also for disposing them to scatter;
for, when they could not understand one another, they could not take
pleasure in one another. Note, God has various means, and effectual
ones, to baffle and defeat the projects of proud men that set themselves
against him, and particularly to divide them among themselves, either by
dividing their spirits ([Jdg 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#023).md), or
by dividing their tongues, as David prays, [Psa
55:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#009.md).

III\. The execution of these counsels of God, to the blasting and
defeating of the counsels of men, [Gen
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#008.md), [Gen
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#009.md). God made them know whose word
should stand, his or theirs, as the expression is, [Jer
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#028.md). Notwithstanding their oneness
and obstinacy, God was too hard for them, and wherein they dealt proudly
he was above them; for who ever hardened his heart against him and
prospered? Three things were done: -

1\. Their language was confounded. God, who, when he made man, taught
him to speak, and put words into his mouth fit to express the
conceptions of his mind by, now caused these builders to forget their
former language, and to speak and understand a new one, which yet was
common to those of the same tribe or family, but not to others: those of
one colony could converse together, but not with those of another. Now,
(1.) This was a great miracle, and a proof of the power which God has
upon the minds and tongues of men, which he turns as the rivers of
water. (2.) This was a great judgment upon these builders; for, being
thus deprived of the knowledge of the ancient and holy tongue, they had
become incapable of communicating with the true church, in which it was
retained, and probably it contributed much to their loss of the
knowledge of the true God. (3.) We all suffer by it, to this day. In all
the inconveniences we sustain by the diversity of languages, and all the
pains and trouble we are at to learn the languages we have occasion for,
we smart for the rebellion of our ancestors at Babel. Nay, and those
unhappy controversies which are strifes of words, and arise from our
misunderstanding one another's language, for aught I know are owing to
this confusion of tongues. (4.) The project of some to frame a universal
character, in order to a universal language, how desirable soever it may
seem, is yet, I think, but a vain thing to attempt; for it is to strive
against a divine sentence, by which the languages of the nations will be
divided while the world stands. (5.) We may here lament the loss of the
universal use of the Hebrew tongue, which from this time was the vulgar
language of the Hebrews only, and continued so till the captivity in
Babylon, where, even among them, it was exchanged for the Syriac. (6.)
As the confounding of tongues divided the children of men and scattered
them abroad, so the gift of tongues, bestowed upon the apostles (Acts
2), contributed greatly to the gathering together of the children of
God, who were scattered abroad, and the uniting of them in Christ, that
with one mind and one mouth they might glorify God, [Rom
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#006.md).

2\. Their building was stopped: They left off to build the city. This
was the effect of the confusion of their tongues; for it not only
incapacitated them for helping one another, but probably struck such a
damp upon their spirits that they could not proceed, since they saw, in
this, the hand of the Lord gone out against them. Note, (1.) It is
wisdom to leave off that which we see God fights against. (2.) God is
ale to blast and bring to nought all the devices and designs of
Babel-builders. He sits in heaven, and laughs at the counsels of the
kings of the earth against him and his anointed; and will force them to
confess that there is no wisdom nor counsel against the Lord, [Pro
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#030.md); [Isa
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#009.md), [Isa
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#010.md).

3\. The builders were scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth,
[Gen 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#008.md), [Gen
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#009.md). They departed in companies,
after their families, and after their tongues ([Gen
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#005.md), [Gen
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#030.md), [Gen
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#031).md), to the several countries and
places allotted to them in the division that had been made, which they
knew before, but would not go to take possession of till now that they
were forced to it. Observe here, (1.) The very thing which they feared
came upon them. That dispersion which sought to evade by an act of
rebellion they by this act brought upon themselves; for we are most
likely to fall into that trouble which we seek to evade by indirect and
sinful methods. (2.) It was God's work: The Lord scattered them. God's
hand is to be acknowledged in all scattering providences; if the family
be scattered, relations scattered, churches scattered, it is the Lord's
doing. (3.) Though they were as firmly in league with one another as
could be, yet the Lord scattered them; for no man can keep together what
God will put asunder. (4.) Thus God justly took vengeance on them for
their oneness in that presumptuous attempt to build their tower.
Shameful dispersions are the just punishment of sinful unions. Simeon
and Levi, who had been brethren in iniquity, were divided in Jacob, [Gen
49:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#005.md), [Gen
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#007.md); [Psa
83:3-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#003). (5..md) They left behind them a
perpetual memorandum of their reproach, in the name given to the place.
It was called Babel, confusion. Those that aim at a great name commonly
come off with a bad name. (6.) The children of men were now finally
scattered, and never did, nor ever will, come all together again, till
the great day, when the Son of man shall sit upon the throne of his
glory, and all nations shall be gathered before him, [Mat
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031.md), [Mat
25:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#032.md).

[Genesis 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 11:10</span></span>

We have here a genealogy, not an endless genealogy, for here it ends in
Abram, the friend of God, and leads further to Christ, the promised
seed, who was the son of Abram, and from Abram the genealogy of Christ
is reckoned ([Mat 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001), etc..md); so that
put ch. 5, ch. 11, and Mt. 1, together, and you have such an entire
genealogy of Jesus Christ as cannot be produced, for aught I know,
concerning any person in the world, out of his line, and at such a
distance from the fountain-head. And, laying these three genealogies
together, we shall find that twice ten, and thrice fourteen, generations
or descents, passed between the first and second Adam, making it clear
concerning Christ that he was not only the Son of Abraham, but the Son
of man, and the seed of woman. Observe here, 1. Nothing is left upon
record concerning those of this line but their names and ages, the Holy
Ghost seeming to hasten through them to the story of Abram. How little
do we know of those that have gone before us in this world, even those
that lived in the same places where we live, as we likewise know little
of those that are our contemporaries in distant places! we have enough
to do to mind the work of our own day, and let God alone to require that
which is past, [Ecc 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#015.md). 2. There was
an observable gradual decrease in the years of their lives. Shem reached
to 600 years, which yet fell short of the age of the patriarchs before
the flood; the next three came short of 500; the next three did not
reach to 300; after them we read not of any that attained to 200, except
Terah; and, not many ages after this, Moses reckoned seventy, or eighty,
to be the utmost men ordinarily arrive at. When the earth began to be
replenished, men's lives began to shorten; so that the decrease is to be
imputed to the wise disposal of Providence, rather than to any decay of
nature. For the elect's sake, men's days are shortened; and, being evil,
it is well they are few, and attain not to the years of the lives of our
fathers, [Gen 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#009.md). 3. Eber, from whom
the Hebrews were denominated, was the longest-lived of any that was born
after the flood, which perhaps was the reward of his singular piety and
strict adherence to the ways of God.

[Genesis 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 11:27</span></span>

Here begins the story of Abram, whose name is famous, henceforward, in
both Testaments. We have here,

I. His country: Ur of the Chaldees. This was the land of his nativity,
an idolatrous country, where even the children of Eber themselves had
degenerated. Note, Those who are, through grace, heirs of the land of
promise, ought to remember what was the land of their nativity, what was
their corrupt and sinful state by nature, the rock out of which they
were hewn.

II\. His relations, mentioned for his sake, and because of their
interest in the following story. 1. His father was Terah, of whom it is
said ([Jos 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#002).md) that he served other
gods, on the other side of the flood, so early did idolatry gain footing
in the world, and so hard is it even for those that have some good
principles to swim against the stream. Though it is said ([Gen
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#026).md) that when Terah was seventy
years old he begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran (which seems to tell us that
Abram was the eldest son of Terah, and was born in his seventieth year),
yet, by comparing [Gen 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#032.md), which
makes Terah to die in his 205th year, with [Act
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#004.md) (where it is said that he was but
seventy-five years old when he removed from Haran), it appears that he
was born in the 130th year of Terah, and probably was his youngest son;
for, in God's choices, the last are often first and the first last. We
have, 2. Some account of his brethren. (1.) Nahor, out of whose family
both Isaac and Jacob had their wives. (2.) Haran, the father of Lot, of
whom it is here said ([Gen 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#028).md) that
he died before his father Terah. Note, Children cannot be sure that they
shall survive their parents; for death does not go by seniority, taking
the eldest first. The shadow of death is without any order, [Job
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#022.md). It is likewise said that he
died in Ur of the Chaldees, before the happy removal of the family out
of that idolatrous country. Note, It concerns us to hasten out of our
natural state, lest death surprise us in it. 3. His wife was Sarai, who
some think, was the same with Iscah, the daughter of Haran. Abram
himself says of her that she was the daughter of his father, but not the
daughter of his mother, [Gen 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#012.md).
She was ten years younger than Abram.

III\. His departure out of Ur of the Chaldees, with his father Terah,
his nephew Lot, and the rest of his family, in obedience to the call of
God, of which we shall read more, [Gen
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md), etc. This chapter leaves them in
Haran, or Charran, a place about mid-way between Ur and Canaan, where
they dwelt till Terah's head was laid, probably because the old man was
unable, through the infirmities of age, to proceed in his journey. Many
reach to Charran, and yet fall short of Canaan; they are not far from
the kingdom of God, and yet never come thither.
