### [Psalms Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 16:0</span></span>

This psalm has something of David in it, but much more of Christ. It
begins with such expressions of devotion as may be applied to Christ;
but concludes with such confidence of a resurrection (and so timely a
one as to prevent corruption) as must be applied to Christ, to him only,
and cannot be understood of David, as both St. Peter and St. Paul have
observed, [Act 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#024.md); [Act
13:36](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#036.md). For David died, and was buried,
and saw corruption. I. David speaks of himself as a member of Christ,
and so he speaks the language of all good Christians, professing his
confidence in God ([Psa 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001).md), his
consent to him ([Psa 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002).md), his
affection to the people of God ([Psa
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003).md), his adherence to the true
worship of God ([Psa 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004).md), and his
entire complacency and satisfaction in God and the interest he had in
him ([Psa 16:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005).md). II. He speaks of
himself as a type of Christ, and so he speaks the language of Christ
himself, to whom all the rest of the psalm is expressly and at large
applied ([Act 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#025), etc..md). David
speaks concerning him (not concerning himself), "I foresaw the Lord
always before my face," etc. And this he spoke, being a prophet (v. 30,
31). He spoke, 1. Of the special presence of God with the Redeemer in
his services and sufferings ([Psa
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008).md). 2. Of the prospect which the
Redeemer had of his own resurrection and the glory that should follow,
which carried him cheerfully through his undertaking ([Psa
16:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#009).md).

Michtam of David.

[Psalms 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 16:1</span></span>

This psalm is entitled Michtam, which some translate a golden psalm, a
very precious one, more to be valued by us than gold, yea, than much
fine gold, because it speaks so plainly of Christ and his resurrection,
who is the true treasure hidden in the field of the Old Testament.

I. David here flies to God's protection with a cheerful believing
confidence in it ([Psa 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001).md):
"Preserve me, O God! from the deaths, and especially from the sins, to
which I am continually exposed; for in thee, and in thee only, do I put
my trust." Those that by faith commit themselves to the divine care, and
submit themselves to the divine guidance, have reason to hope for the
benefit of both. This is applicable to Christ, who prayed, Father, save
me from this hour, and trusted in God that he would deliver him.

II\. He recognizes his solemn dedication of himself to God as his God
([Psa 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002).md): "O my soul! thou hast
said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord, and therefore thou mayest venture
to trust him." Note, 1. It is the duty and interest of every one of us
to acknowledge the Lord for our Lord, to subject ourselves to him, and
then to stay ourselves upon him. Adonai signifies My stayer, the
strength of my heart. 2. This must be done with our souls: "O my soul!
thou hast said it." Covenanting with God must be heart-work; all that is
within us must be employed therein and engaged thereby. 3. Those who
have avouched the Lord for their Lord should be often putting themselves
in mind of what they have done. "Hast thou said unto the Lord, Thou art
my Lord? Say it again then, stand to it, abide by it, and never unsay
it. Hast thou said it? Take the comfort of it, and live up to it. He is
thy Lord, and worship thou him, and let thy eye be ever towards him."

III\. He devotes himself to the honour of God in the service of the
saints ([Psa 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002.md), [Psa
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003).md): My goodness extends not to
thee, but to the saints. Observe, 1. Those that have taken the lord for
their Lord must, like him, be good and do good; we do not expect
happiness without goodness. 2. Whatever good there is in us, or is done
by us, we must humbly acknowledge that it extends not to God; so that we
cannot pretend to merit any thing by it. God has no need of our
services; he is not benefited by them, nor can they add any thing to his
infinite perfection and blessedness. The wisest, and best, and most
useful, men in the world cannot be profitable to God, [Job
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#002.md); [Job
35:7](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#007.md). God is infinitely above us, and
happy without us, and whatever good we do it is all from him; so that we
are indebted to him, not he to us: David owns it ([Ch1
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#014).md), Of thy own have we given thee.
3. If God be ours, we must, for his sake, extend our goodness to those
that are his, to the saints in the earth; for what is done to them he is
pleased to take as done to himself, having constituted them his
receivers. Note, (1.) There are saints in the earth; and saints on earth
we must all be, or we shall never be saints in heaven. Those that are
renewed by the grace of God, and devoted to the glory of God, are saints
on earth. (2.) The saints in the earth are excellent ones, great,
mighty, magnificent ones, and yet some of them so poor in the world that
they need to have David's goodness extended to them. God makes them
excellent by the grace he gives them. The righteous is more excellent
than his neighbour, and then he accounts them excellent. They are
precious in his sight and honourable; they are his jewels, his peculiar
treasure. Their God is their glory, and a diadem of beauty to them. (3.)
All that have taken the Lord for their God delight in his saints as
excellent ones, because they bear his image, and because he loves them.
David, though a king, was a companion of all that feared God ([Psa
119:63](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#063).md), even the meanest, which was a
sign that his delight was in them. (4.) It is not enough for us to
delight in the saints, but, as there is occasion, our goodness must
extend to them; we must be ready to show them the kindness they need,
distribute to their necessities, and abound in the labour of love to
them. This is applicable to Christ. The salvation he wrought out for us
was no gain to God, for our ruin would have been no loss to him; but the
goodness and benefit of it extend to us men, in whom he delighteth, [Pro
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#031.md). For their sakes, says he, I
sanctify myself, [Joh 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#019.md). Christ
delights even in the saints on earth, notwithstanding their weaknesses
and manifold informities, which is a good reason why we should.

IV\. He disclaims the worship of all false gods and all communion with
their worshippers, [Psa 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004.md). Here, 1.
He reads the doom of idolaters, who hasten after another God, being mad
upon their idols, and pursuing them as eagerly as if they were afraid
they would escape from them: Their sorrows shall be multiplied, both by
the judgments they bring upon themselves from the true God whom they
forsake and by the disappointment they will meet with in the false gods
they embrace. Those that multiply gods multiply griefs to themselves;
for, whoever thinks one God too little, will find two too many, and yet
hundreds not enough. 2. He declares his resolution to have no fellowship
with them nor with their unfruitful works of darkness: "Their
drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, not only because the gods
they are offered to are a lie, but because the offerings themselves are
barbarous." At God's altar, because the blood made atonement, the
drinking of it was most strictly prohibited, and the drink-offerings
were of wine; but the devil prescribed to his worshippers to drink of
the blood of the sacrifices, to teach them cruelty. "I will have nothing
to do" (says David) "with those bloody deities, nor so much as take
their names into my lips with any delight in them or respect to them."
Thus must we hate idols and idolatry with a perfect hatred. Some make
this also applicable to Christ and his undertaking, showing the nature
of the sacrifice he offered (it was not the blood of bulls and goats,
which was offered according to the law; that was never named, nor did he
ever make any mention of it, but his own blood), showing also the
multiplied sorrows of the unbelieving Jews, who hastened after another
king, Caesar, and are still hastening after another Messiah, whom they
in vain look for.

V. He repeats the solemn choice he had made of God for his portion and
happiness ([Psa 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005).md), takes to
himself the comfort of the choice ([Psa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006).md), and gives God the glory of it,
[Psa 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#007.md). This is very much the
language of a devout and pious soul in its gracious exercises.

1\. Choosing the Lord for its portion and happiness. "Most men take the
world for their chief good, and place their felicity in the enjoyments
of it; but this I say, The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of
my cup, the portion I make choice of, and will gladly take up with, how
poor soever my condition is in this world. Let me have the love and
favour of God, and be accepted of him; let me have the comfort of
communion with God, and satisfaction in the communications of his graces
and comforts; let me have an interest in his promises, and a title by
promise to everlasting life and happiness in the future state; and I
have enough, I need no more, I desire no more, to complete my felicity."
Would we do well and wisely for ourselves, we must take God, in Christ,
to be, (1.) The portion of our inheritance in the other world. Heaven is
an inheritance. God himself is the inheritance of the saints there,
whose everlasting bliss is to enjoy him. We must take that for our
inheritance, our home, our rest, our lasting, everlasting, good, and
look upon this world to be no more ours than the country through which
our road lies when we are on a journey. (2.) The portion of our cup in
this world, with which we are nourished, and refreshed, and kept from
fainting. Those have not God for theirs who do not reckon his comforts
the most reviving cordials, acquaint themselves with them, and make use
of them as sufficient to counterbalance all the grievances of this
present time and to sweeten the most bitter cup of affliction.

2\. Confiding in him for the securing of this portion: "Thou maintainest
my lot. Thou that hast by promise made over thy self to me, to be mine,
wilt graciously make good what thou hast promised, and never leave me to
myself to forfeit this happiness, nor leave it in the power of my
enemies to rob me of it. Nothing shall pluck me out of thy hands, nor
separate me from thy love, and the sure mercies of David." The saints
and their bliss are kept by the power of God.

3\. Rejoicing in this portion, and taking a complacency in it ([Psa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006).md): The lines have fallen to me in
pleasant places. Those have reason to say so that have God for their
portion; they have a worthy portion, a goodly heritage. What can they
have better? What can they desire more? Return unto thy rest, O my soul!
and look no further. Note, Gracious persons, though they still covet
more of God, never covet more than God; but, being satisfied of his
loving-kindness, they are abundantly satisfied with it, and envy not any
their carnal mirth and sensual pleasures and delights, but account
themselves truly happy in what they have, and doubt not but to be
completely happy in what they hope for. Those whose lot is cast, as
David's was, in a land of light, in a valley of vision, where God is
known and worshipped, have, upon that account, reason to say, The lines
have fallen to me in pleasant places; much more those who have not only
the means, but the end, not only Immanuel's land, but Immanuel's love.

4\. Giving thanks to God for it, and for grace to make this wise and
happy choice ([Psa 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#007).md): "I will
bless the Lord who has given me counsel, this counsel, to take him for
my portion and happiness." So ignorant and foolish are we that, if we be
left to ourselves, our hearts will follow our eyes, and we shall choose
our own delusions, and forsake our own mercies for lying vanities; and
therefore, if we have indeed taken God for our portion and preferred
spiritual and eternal blessings before those that are sensible and
temporal, we must thankfully acknowledge the power and goodness of
divine grace directing and enabling us to make that choice. If we have
the pleasure of it, let God have the praise of it.

5\. Making a good use of it. God having given him counsel by his word
and Spirit, his own reins also (his own thoughts) instructed him in the
night-season; when he was silent and solitary, and retired from the
world, then his own conscience (which is called the reins, [Jer
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#010).md) not only reflected with comfort
upon the choice he had made, but instructed or admonished him concerning
the duties arising out of this choice, catechized him, and engaged and
quickened him to live as one that had God for his portion, by faith to
live upon him and to live to him. Those who have God for their portion,
and who will be faithful to him, must give their own consciences leave
to deal thus faithfully and plainly with them.

All this may be applied to Christ, who made the Lord his portion and was
pleased with that portion, made his Father's glory his highest end and
made it his meat and drink to seek that and to do his will, and
delighted to prosecute his undertaking, pursuant to his Father's
counsel, depending upon him to maintain his lot and to carry him through
his undertaking. We may also apply it to ourselves in singing it,
renewing our choice of God as ours, with a holy complacency and
satisfaction.

[Psalms 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 16:8</span></span>

All these verses are quoted by St. Peter in his first sermon, after the
pouring out of the Spirit on the day of pentecost ([Act
2:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#025).md); and he tells us expressly
that David in them speaks concerning Christ and particularly of his
resurrection. Something we may allow here of the workings of David's own
pious and devout affections towards God, depending upon his grace to
perfect every thing that concerned him, and looking for the blessed
hope, and happy state on the other side death, in the enjoyment of God;
but in these holy elevations towards God and heaven he was carried by
the spirit of prophecy quite beyond the consideration of himself and his
own case, to foretel the glory of the Messiah, in such expressions as
were peculiar to that, and could not be understood of himself. The New
Testament furnishes us with a key to let us into the mystery of these
lines.

I. These verses must certainly be applied to Christ; of him speaks the
prophet this, as did many of the Old Testament prophets, who testified
beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow
([Pe1 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011).md), and that is the subject
of this prophecy here. It is foretold (as he himself showed concerning
this, no doubt, among other prophecies in this psalm, [Luk
24:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#044.md), [Luk
24:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#046).md) that Christ should suffer, and
rise from the dead, [Co1 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#003.md), [Co1
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#004.md).

1\. That he should suffer and die. This is implied here when he says
([Psa 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008).md), I shall not be moved; he
supposed that he should be struck at, and have a dreadful shock given
him, as he had in his agony, when his soul was exceedingly sorrowful,
and he prayed that the cup might pass from him. When he says, "My flesh
shall rest," it is implied that he must put off the body, and therefore
must go through the pains of death. It is likewise plainly intimated
that his soul must go into a state of separation from the body, and that
his body, so deserted, would be in imminent danger of seeing corruption
- that he should not only die, but be buried, and abide for some time
under the power of death.

2\. That he should be wonderfully borne up by the divine power in
suffering and dying. (1.) That he should not be moved, should not be
driven off from his undertaking nor sink under the weight of it, that he
should not fail nor be discouraged ([Isa
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#004).md), but should proceed and
persevere in it, till he could say, It is finished. Though the service
was hard and the encounter hot, and he trod the winepress alone, yet he
was not moved, did not give up the cause, but set his face as a flint,
[Isa 50:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007.md). Here am I, let these go
their way. Nay, (2.) That his heart should rejoice and his glory be
glad, that he should go on with his undertaking, not only resolutely,
but cheerfully, and with unspeakable pleasure and satisfaction, witness
that saying ([Joh 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#011).md), Now I am no
more in the world, but I come to thee, and that ([Joh
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#011).md), The cup that my Father has
given me, shall I not drink it? and many the like. By his glory is meant
his tongue, as appears, [Act 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#026.md). For
our tongue is our glory, and never more so than when it is employed in
glorifying God. Now there were three things which bore him up and
carried him on thus cheerfully: - \[1.\] The respect he had to his
Father's will and glory in what he did: I have set the Lord always
before me. He still had an eye to his Father's commandment ([Joh
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#018.md), [Joh
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#031).md), the will of him that sent him.
He aimed at his Father's honour and the restoring of the interests of
his kingdom among men, and this kept him from being moved by the
difficulties he met with; for he always did those things that pleased
his Father. \[2.\] The assurance he had of his Father's presence with
him in his sufferings: He is at my right hand, a present help to me,
nigh at hand in the time of need. He is near that justifieth me ([Isa
50:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#008).md); he is at my right hand, to
direct and strengthen it, and hold it up, [Psa
89:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#021.md). When he was in his agony an
angel was sent from heaven to strengthen him, [Luk
22:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#043.md). To this the victories and
triumphs of the cross were all owing; it was the Lord at his right hand
that struck through kings, [Psa 110:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#005.md);
[Isa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md), [Isa
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#002.md). \[3.\] The prospect he had of a
glorious issue of his sufferings. It was for the joy set before him that
he endured the cross, [Heb 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002.md). He
rested in hope, and that made his rest glorious, [Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010.md). He knew he should be justified
in the Spirit by his resurrection, and straightway glorified. See [Joh
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#031.md), [Joh
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#032.md).

3\. That he should be brought through his sufferings, and brought from
under the power of death by a glorious resurrection. (1.) That his soul
should not be left in hell, that is, his human spirit should not be long
left, as other men's spirits are, in a state of separation from the
body, but should, in a little time, return and be re-united to it, never
to part again. (2.) That being God's holy One in a peculiar manner,
sanctified to the work of redemption and perfectly free from sin, he
should not see corruption nor feel it. This implies that he should not
only be raised from the grave, but raised so soon that his dead body
should not so much as being to corrupt, which, in the course of nature,
it would have done if it had not been raised the third day. We, who have
so much corruption in our souls, must expect that our bodies also will
corrupt ([Job 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#019).md); but that holy
One of God who knew no sin saw no corruption. Under the law it was
strictly ordered that those parts of the sacrifices which were not burnt
upon the altar should by no means be kept till the third day, lest they
should putrefy ([Lev 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#015.md), [Lev
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#018).md), which perhaps pointed at
Christ's rising the third day, that he might not see corruption -
neither was a bone of him broken.

4\. That he should be abundantly recompensed for his sufferings, with
the joy set before him, [Psa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011.md). he
was well assured, (1.) That he should not miss of his glory: "Thou wilt
show me the path of life, and lead me to that life through this darksome
valley." In confidence of this, when he gave up the ghost, he said,
Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit; and, a little before, Father,
glorify me with thy own self. (2.) That he should be received into the
presence of God, to sit at his right hand. His being admitted into God's
presence would be the acceptance of his service and his being set at his
right hand the recompence of it. (3.) Thus, as a reward for the sorrows
he underwent for our redemption, he should have a fulness of joy, and
pleasures for evermore; not only the glory he had with God, as God,
before all worlds, but the joy and pleasure of a Mediator, in seeing his
seed, and the success and prosperity of his undertaking, [Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md), [Isa
53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011.md).

II\. Christ being the Head of the body, the church, these verses may,
for the most part, be applied to all good Christians, who are guided and
animated by the Spirit of Christ; and, in singing them, when we have
first given glory to Christ, in whom, to our everlasting comfort, they
have had their accomplishment, we may then encourage and edify ourselves
and one another with them, and may hence learn, 1. That it is our wisdom
and duty to set the Lord always before us, and to see him continually at
our right hand, wherever we are, to eye him as our chief good and
highest end, our owner, ruler, and judge, our gracious benefactor, our
sure guide and strict observer; and, while we do thus, we shall not be
moved either from our duty or from our comfort. Blessed Paul set the
Lord before him, when, though bonds and afflictions did await him, he
could bravely say, None of these things move me, [Act
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#024.md). 2. That, if our eyes be ever
towards God, our hearts and tongues may ever rejoice in him; it is our
own fault if they do not. If the heart rejoice in God, out of the
abundance of that let the mouth speak, to his glory, and the edification
of others. 3. That dying Christians, as well as a dying Christ, may
cheerfully put off the body, in a believing expectation of a joyful
resurrection: My flesh also shall rest in hope. Our bodies have little
rest in this world, but in the grave they shall rest as in their beds,
[Isa 57:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#002.md). We have little to hope for
from this life, but we shall rest in hope of a better life; we may put
off the body in that hope. Death destroys the hope of man ([Job
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#019).md), but not the hope of a good
Christian, [Pro 14:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#032.md). He has hope in
his death, living hopes in dying moments, hopes that the body shall not
be left for ever in the grave, but, though it see corruption for a time,
it shall, at the end of the time, be raised to immortality; Christ's
resurrection is an earnest of ours if we be his. 4. That those who live
piously with God in their eye may die comfortably with heaven in their
eye. In this world sorrow is our lot, but in heaven there is joy. All
our joys here are empty and defective, but in heaven there is a fulness
of joy. Our pleasures here are transient and momentary, and such is the
nature of them that it is not fit they should last long; but those at
God's right hand are pleasures for evermore; for they are the pleasures
of immortal souls in the immediate vision and fruition of an eternal
God.
