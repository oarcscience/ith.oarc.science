### [Psalms Chapter 122](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 122:0</span></span>

This psalm seems to have been penned by David for the use of the people
of Israel, when they came up to Jerusalem to worship at the three solemn
feasts. It was in David's time that Jerusalem was first chosen to be the
city where God would record his name. It being a new thing, this, among
other means, was used to bring the people to be in love with Jerusalem,
as the holy city, though it was but the other day in the hands of the
Jebusites. Observe, I. The joy with which they were to go up to
Jerusalem ([Psa 122:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001.md), [Psa
122:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#002).md). II. The great esteem they were
to have of Jerusalem ([Psa 122:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#003).md).
III. The great concern they were to have for Jerusalem, and the prayers
they were to put up for its welfare ([Psa
122:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#006).md). In singing this psalm we
must have an eye to the gospel church, which is called the "Jerusalem
that is from above."

A song of degrees of David.

[Psalms 122:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 122:1</span></span>

Here we have,

I. The pleasure which David and other pious Israelites took in
approaching to and attending upon God in public ordinances, [Psa
122:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001.md), [Psa
122:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#002.md).

1\. The invitation to them was very welcome. David was himself glad, and
would have every Israelite to say that he was glad, when he was called
upon to go up to the house of the Lord. Note, (1.) It is the will of God
that we should worship him in concert, that many should join together to
wait upon him in public ordinances. We ought to worship God in our own
houses, but that is not enough; we must go into the house of the Lord,
to pay our homage to him there, and not forsake the assembling of
ourselves together. (2.) We should not only agree with one another, but
excite and stir up one another, to go to worship God in public. Let us
go; not, "Do you go and pray for us, and we will stay at home;" but, We
will go also, [Zac 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#021.md). Not, "Do you
go before, and we will follow at our leisure;" or, "We will go first,
and you shall come after us;" but, "Let us go together, for the honour
of God and for our mutual edification and encouragement." We ourselves
are slow and backward, and others are so too, and therefore we should
thus quicken and sharpen one another to that which is good, as iron
sharpens iron. (3.) Those that rejoice in God will rejoice in calls and
opportunities to wait upon him. David himself, though he had as little
need of a spur to his zeal in religious exercises as any, yet was so far
from taking it as an affront that he was glad of it as a kindness when
he was called upon to go up to the house of the Lord with the meanest of
his subjects. We should desire our Christian friends, when they have any
good work in hand, to call for us and take us along with them.

2\. The prospect of them was very pleasing. They speak it with a holy
triumph ([Psa 122:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#002).md): Our feet shall
stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem! Those that came out of the country,
when they found the journey tedious, comforted themselves with this,
that they should be in Jerusalem shortly, and that would make amends for
all the fatigues of their journey. We shall stand there as servants; it
is desirable to have a place in Jerusalem, though it be among those that
stand by ([Zac 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#007).md), though it be the
door keeper's place, [Psa 84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010.md). We
have now got a resting-place for the ark, and where it is there will we
be.

II\. The praises of Jerusalem, as [Psa
48:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#012.md).

1\. It is the beautiful city, not only for situation, but for building.
It is built into a city, the houses not scattered, but contiguous, and
the streets fair and spacious. It is built uniform, compact together,
the houses strengthening and supporting one another. Though the city was
divided into the higher and lower town, yet the Jebusites being driven
out, and it being entirely in the possession of God's people, it is said
to be compact together. It was a type of the gospel-church, which is
compact together in holy love and Christian communion, so that it is all
as one city.

2\. It is the holy city, [Psa 122:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#004.md).
It is the place where all Israel meet one another: Thither the tribes go
up, from all parts of the country, as one man, under the character of
the tribes of the Lord, in obedience to his command. It is the place
appointed for their general rendezvous; and they come together, (1.) To
receive instruction from God; they come to the testimony of Israel, to
hear what God has to say to them and to consult his oracle. (2.) To
ascribe the glory to God, to give thanks to the name of the Lord, which
we have all reason to do, especially those that have the testimony of
Israel among them. If God speak to us by his word, we have reason to
answer him by our thanksgivings. See on what errand we go to public
worship, to give thanks.

3\. It is the royal city ([Psa 122:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#005).md):
There are set thrones of judgment. Therefore the people had reason to be
in love with Jerusalem, because justice was administered there by a man
after God's own heart. The civil interests of the people were as well
secured as their ecclesiastical concerns; and very happy they were in
their courts of judicature, which were erected in Jerusalem, as with us
in Westminster Hall. Observe, What a goodly sight it was to see the
testimony of Israel and the thrones of judgment such near neighbours,
and they are good neighbours, which may greatly befriend one another.
Let the testimony of Israel direct the thrones of judgment, and the
thrones of judgment protect the testimony of Israel.

[Psalms 122:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 122:6</span></span>

Here, I. David calls upon others to which well to Jerusalem, [Psa
122:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#006.md), [Psa
122:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#007.md). Pray for the peace of
Jerusalem, for the welfare of it, for all good to it, particularly for
the uniting of the inhabitants among themselves and their preservation
from the incursions of enemies. This we may truly desire, that in the
peace thereof we may have peace; and this we must earnestly pray for,
for it is the gift of God, and for it he will be enquired of. Those that
can do nothing else for the peace of Jerusalem can pray for it, which is
something more than showing their good-will; it is the appointed way of
fetching in mercy. The peace and welfare of the gospel church,
particularly in our land, is to be earnestly desired and prayed for by
every one of us. Now, 1. We are here encouraged in our prayers for
Jerusalem's peace: Those shall prosper that love thee. We must pray for
Jerusalem, not out of custom, nor for fashion's sake, but out of a
principle of love to God's government of man and man's worship of God;
and, in seeking the public welfare, we seek our own, for so well does
God love the gates of Zion that he will love all those that do love
them, and therefore they cannot but prosper; at least their souls shall
prosper by the ordinances they so dearly love. 2. We are here directed
in our prayers for it and words are put into our mouths ([Psa
122:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#007).md): Peace be within thy walls. He
teaches us to pray, (1.) For all the inhabitants in general, all within
the walls, from the least to the greatest. Peace be in thy
fortifications; let them never be attacked, or, if they be, let them
never be taken, but be an effectual security to the city. (2.) For the
princes and rulers especially: Let prosperity be in the palaces of the
great men that sit at the helm and have the direction of public affairs;
for, if they prosper, it will be well for the public. The poorer sort
are apt to envy the prosperity of the palaces, but they are here taught
to pray for it.

II\. He resolves that whatever others do he will approve himself a
faithful friend to Jerusalem, 1. In his prayers: "I will now say, now I
see the tribes so cheerfully resorting hither to the testimony of
Israel, and the matter settled, that Jerusalem must be the place where
God will record his name, now I will say, Peace be within thee." He did
not say, "Let others pray for the public peace, the priests and the
prophets, whose business it is, and the people, that have nothing else
to do, and I will fight for it and rule for it." No; "I will pray for it
too." 2. In his endeavours, with which he will second his prayers: "I
will, to the utmost of my power, seek thy good." Whatever lies within
the sphere of our activity to do for the public good we must do it, else
we are not sincere in praying for it. Now it might be said, No thanks to
David to be so solicitous for the welfare of Jerusalem; it was his own
city, and the interests of his family were lodged in it. This is true;
yet he professes that this was not the reason why he was in such care
for the welfare of Jerusalem, but it proceeded from the warm regard he
had, (1.) To the communion of saints: It is for my brethren and
companions' sakes, that is, for the sake of all true-hearted Israelites,
whom I look upon as my brethren (so he called them, [Ch1
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002).md) and who have often been my
companions in the worship of God, which has knit my heart to them. (2.)
To the ordinances of God: He had set his affections to the house of his
God ([Ch1 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#003).md); he took a great
pleasure in public worship, and for that reason would pray for the good
of Jerusalem. Then our concern for the public welfare is right when it
is the effect of a sincere love to God's institutions and his faithful
worshippers.
