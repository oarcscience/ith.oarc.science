### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001.md)

[1 Thessalonians](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">th1 5:0</span></span>

The apostle, having spoken in the end of the foregoing chapter
concerning the resurrection, and the second coming of Christ, proceeds
to speak concerning the uselessness of enquiring after the particular
time of Christ's coming, which would be sudden and terrible to the
wicked, but comfortable to the saints ([Th1
5:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001).md). He then exhorts them to the
duties of watchfulness, sobriety, and the exercise of faith, love, and
hope, as being suitable to their state ([Th1
5:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#006).md). In the next words he exhorts
them to several duties they owed to others, or to one another ([Th1
5:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#011).md), afterwards to several other
Christian duties of great importance ([Th1
5:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#016).md), and then concludes this
epistle ([Th1 5:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023).md).

[1 Thessalonians 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 5:1</span></span>

In these words observe,

I. The apostle tells the Thessalonians it was needless or useless to
enquire about the particular time of Christ's coming: Of the times and
seasons you need not that I write unto you, [Th1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001.md). The thing is certain that Christ
will come, and there is a certain time appointed for his coming; but
there was no need that the apostle should write about this, and
therefore he had no revelation given him; nor should they or we enquire
into this secret, which the Father has reserved in his own power. Of
that day and hour knoweth no man. Christ himself did not reveal this
while upon earth; it was not in his commission as the great prophet of
the church: nor did he reveal this to his apostles; there was no need of
this. There are times and seasons for us to do our work in: these it is
our duty and interest to know and observe; but the time and season when
we must give up our account we know not, nor is it needful that we
should know them. Note, There are many things which our vain curiosity
desires to know which there is no necessity at all of our knowing, nor
would our knowledge of them do us good.

II\. He tells them that the coming of Christ would be sudden, and a
great surprise to most men, [Th1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002.md).
And this is what they knew perfectly, or might know, because our Lord
himself had so said: In such an hour as you think not, the Son of man
cometh, [Mat 24:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#044.md). So [Mar
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#035.md), [Mar
13:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#036.md), Watch you therefore, for you
know not when the master of the house cometh; lest, coming suddenly, he
find you sleeping. And no doubt the apostle had told them, as of the
coming of Christ, so also of his coming suddenly, which is the meaning
of his coming as a thief in the night, [Rev
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#015.md). As the thief usually cometh in
the dead time of the night, when he is least expected, such a surprise
will the day of the Lord be; so sudden and surprising will be his
appearance. The knowledge of this will be more useful than to know the
exact time, because this should awaken us to stand upon our watch, that
we may be ready whenever he cometh.

III\. He tells them how terrible Christ's coming would be to the
ungodly, [Th1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#003.md). It will be to their
destruction in that day of the Lord. The righteous God will bring ruin
upon his and his people's enemies; and this their destruction, as it
will be total and final, so, 1. It will be sudden. It will overtake
them, and fall upon them, in the midst of their carnal security and
jollity, when they say in their hearts, Peace and safety, when they
dream of felicity and please themselves with vain amusements of their
fancies or their senses, and think not of it, - as travail cometh upon a
woman with child, at the set time indeed, but not perhaps just then
expected, nor greatly feared. 2. It will be unavoidable destruction too:
They shall not escape; they shall in no wise escape. There will be no
means possible for them to avoid the terror nor the punishment of that
day. There will be no place where the workers of iniquity shall be able
to hide themselves, no shelter from the storm, nor shadow from the
burning heat that shall consume the wicked.

IV\. He tells them how comfortable this day will be to the righteous,
[Th1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004.md), [Th1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#005.md). Here observe, 1. Their character
and privilege. They are not in darkness; they are the children of the
light, etc. This was the happy condition of the Thessalonians as it is
of all true Christians. They were not in a state of sin and ignorance as
the heathen world. They were some time darkness, but were made light in
the Lord. They were favoured with the divine revelation of things that
are unseen and eternal, particularly concerning the coming of Christ,
and the consequences thereof. They were the children of the day, for the
day-star had risen upon them; yea, the Sun of righteousness had arisen
on them with healing under his wings. They were no longer under the
darkness of heathenism, nor under the shadows of the law, but under the
gospel, which brings life and immortality to light. [Ti2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010.md). 2. Their great advantage on this
account: that that day should not overtake them as a thief, [Th1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004.md). It was at least their own fault
if they were surprised by that day. They had fair warning, and
sufficient helps to provide against that day, and might hope to stand
with comfort and confidence before the Son of man. This would be a time
of refreshing to them from the presence of the Lord, who to those that
look for him will appear without sin unto their salvation, and will come
to them as a friend in the day, not as a thief in the night.

[1 Thessalonians 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th1 5:6</span></span>

On what had been said, the apostle grounds seasonable exhortations to
several needful duties.

I. To watchfulness and sobriety, [Th1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#006.md). These duties are distinct, yet
they mutually befriend one another. For, while we are compassed about
with so many temptations to intemperance and excess, we shall not keep
sober, unless we be upon our guard, and, unless we keep sober, we shall
not long watch. 1. Then let us not sleep as do others, but let us watch;
we must not be secure and careless, nor indulge spiritual sloth and
idleness. We must not be off our watch, but continually upon our guard
against sin, and temptation to it. The generality of men are too
careless of their duty and regardless of their spiritual enemies. They
say, Peace and safety, when they are in the greatest danger, doze away
their precious moments on which eternity depends, indulging idle dreams,
and have no more thoughts nor cares about another world than men that
are asleep have about this. Either they do not consider the things of
another world at all, because they are asleep; or they do not consider
them aright, because they dream. But let us watch, and act like men that
are awake, and that stand upon their guard. 2. Let us also be sober, or
temperate and moderate. Let us keep our natural desires and appetites
after the things of this world within due bounds. Sobriety is usually
opposed to excess in meats and drinks, and here particularly it is
opposed to drunkenness; but it also extends to all other temporal
things. Thus our Saviour warned his disciples to take heed lest their
hearts should be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares
of this life, and so that day come on them unawares, [Luk
21:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#034.md). Our moderation then, as to all
temporal things, should be known to all men, because the Lord is at
hand. Besides this, watchfulness and sobriety are most suitable to the
Christian's character and privilege, as being children of the day;
because those that sleep sleep in the night, and those that are drunken
are drunken in the night, [Th1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#007.md). It
is a most reproachful thing for men to sleep away the day-time, which is
for work and not for sleep, to be drunken in the day, when so many eyes
are upon them, to behold their shame. It was not so strange if those who
had not the benefit of divine revelation suffered themselves to be
lulled asleep by the devil in carnal security, and if they laid the
reins upon the neck of their appetites, and indulged themselves in all
manner of riot and excess; for it was night-time with them. They were
not sensible of their danger, therefore they slept; they were not
sensible of their duty, therefore they were drunk: but it ill becomes
Christians to do thus. What! shall Christians, who have the light of the
blessed gospel shining in their faces, be careless about their souls,
and unmindful of another world? Those who have so many eyes upon them
should conduct themselves with peculiar propriety.

II\. To be well armed as well as watchful: to put on the whole armour of
God. This is necessary in order to such sobriety as becomes us and will
be a preparation for the day of the Lord, because our spiritual enemies
are many, and mighty, and malicious. They draw many to their interest,
and keep them in it, by making them careless, secure, and presumptuous,
by making them drunk - drunk with pride, drunk with passion, drunk and
giddy with self-conceit, drunk with the gratifications of sense: so that
we have need to arm ourselves against their attempts, by putting on the
spiritual breast-plate to keep the heart, and the spiritual helmet to
secure the head; and this spiritual armour consists of three great
graces of Christians, faith, love, and hope, [Th1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008.md). 1. We must live by faith, and
this will keep us watchful and sober. If we believe that the eye of God
(who is a spirit) is always upon us, that we have spiritual enemies to
grapple with, that there is a world of spirits to prepare for, we shall
see reason to watch and be sober. Faith will be our best defence against
the assaults of our enemies. 2. We must get a heart inflamed with love;
and this also will be our defence. True and fervent love to God, and the
things of God, will keep us watchful and sober, and hinder our apostasy
in times of trouble and temptation. 3. We must make salvation our hope,
and should have a lively hope of it. This good hope, through grace, of
eternal life, will be as a helmet to defend the head, and hinder our
being intoxicated with the pleasures of sin, which are but for a season.
If we have hope of salvation, let us take heed of doing any thing that
shall shake our hopes, or render us unworthy of or unfit for the great
salvation we hope for. Having mentioned salvation and the hope of it,
the apostle shows what grounds and reasons Christians have to hope for
this salvation, as to which observe, He says nothing of their meriting
it. No, the doctrine of our merits is altogether unscriptural and
antiscriptural; there is no foundation of any good hope upon that
account. But our hopes are to be grounded, (1.) Upon God's appointment:
because God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation,
[Th1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#009.md). If we would trace our
salvation to the first cause, that is God's appointment. Those who live
and die in darkness and ignorance, who sleep and are drunken as in the
night, are, it is but too plain, appointed to wrath; but as for those
who are of the day, if they watch and be sober, it is evident that they
are appointed to obtain salvation. And the sureness and firmness of the
divine appointment are the great support and encouragement of our hope.
Were we to obtain salvation by our own merit or power, we could have but
little or no hope of it; but seeing we are to obtain it by virtue of
God's appointment, which we are sure cannot be shaken (for his purpose,
according to election, shall stand), on this we build unshaken hope,
especially when we consider, (2.) Christ's merit and grace, and that
salvation is by our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us. Our salvation
therefore is owing to, and our hopes of it are grounded on, Christ's
atonement as well as God's appointment: and, as we should think on God's
gracious design and purpose, so also on Christ's death and sufferings,
for this end, that whether we wake or sleep (whether we live or die, for
death is but a sleep to believers, as the apostles had before intimated)
we should live together with Christ live in union and in glory with him
for ever. And, as it is the salvation that Christians hope for to be for
ever with the Lord, so one foundation of their hope is their union with
him. And if they are united with Christ, and live in him, and live to
him, here, the sleep of death will be no prejudice to the spiritual
life, much less to the life of glory hereafter. On the contrary, Christ
died for us, that, living and dying, we might be his; that we might live
to him while we are here, and live with him when we go hence.

[1 Thessalonians 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th1 5:11</span></span>

In these words the apostle exhorts the Thessalonians to several duties.

I. Towards those who were nearly related one to another. Such should
comfort themselves, or exhort one another, and edify one another, [Th1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#011.md). 1. They must comfort or exhort
themselves and one another; for the original word may be rendered both
these ways. And we may observe, As those are most able and likely to
comfort others who can comfort themselves, so the way to have comfort
ourselves, or to administer comfort to others, is by compliance with the
exhortation of the word. Note, We should not only be careful about our
own comfort and welfare, but to promote the comfort and welfare of
others also. He was a Cain that said, Am I my brother's keeper? We must
bear one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. 2. They
must edify one another, by following after those things whereby one may
edify another, [Rom 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#019.md). As
Christians are lively stones built up together a spiritual house, they
should endeavour to promote the good of the whole church by promoting
the work of grace in one another. And it is the duty of every one of us
to study that which is for the edification of those with whom we
converse, to please all men for their real profit. We should communicate
our knowledge and experiences one to another. We should join in prayer
and praise one with another. We should set a good example one before
another. And it is the duty of those especially who live in the same
vicinity and family thus to comfort and edify one another; and this is
the best neighbourhood, the best means to answer the end of society.
Such as are nearly related together and have affection for one another,
as they have the greatest opportunity, so they are under the greatest
obligation, to do this kindness one to another. This the Thessalonians
did (which also you do), and this is what they are exhorted to continue
and increase in doing. Note, Those who do that which is good have need
of further exhortations to excite them to do good, to do more good, as
well as continue in doing what they do.

II\. He shows them their duty towards their ministers, [Th1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012.md), [Th1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#013.md). Though the apostle himself was
driven from them, yet they had others who laboured among them, and to
whom they owed these duties. The apostle here exhorts them to observe,

1\. How the ministers of the gospel are described by the work of their
office; and they should rather mind the work and duty they are called to
than affect venerable and honourable names that they may be called by.
Their work is very weighty, and very honourable and useful. (1.)
Ministers must labour among their people, labour with diligence, and
unto weariness (so the word in the original imports); they must labour
in the word and doctrine, [Ti1 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017.md).
They are called labourers, and should not be loiterers. They must labour
with their people, to instruct, comfort, and edify them. And, (2.)
Ministers are to rule their people also, so the word is rendered, [Ti1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017.md). They must rule, not with rigour,
but with love. They must not exercise dominion as temporal lords; but
rule as spiritual guides, by setting a good example to the flock. They
are over the people in the Lord, to distinguish them from civil
magistrates, and to denote also that they are but ministers under
Christ, appointed by him, and must rule the people by Christ's laws, and
not by laws of their own. This may also intimate the end of their office
and all their labour; namely, the service and honour of the Lord. (3.)
They must also admonish the people, and that not only publicly, but
privately, as there may be occasion. They must instruct them to do well,
and should reprove when they do ill. It is their duty not only to give
good counsel, but also to give admonition, to give warning to the flock
of the dangers they are liable to, and reprove for negligence or what
else may be amiss.

2\. What the duty of the people is towards their ministers. There is a
mutual duty between ministers and people. If ministers should labour
among the people, then, (1.) The people must know them. As the shepherd
should know his flock, so the sheep must know their shepherd. They must
know his person, hear his voice, acknowledge him for their pastor, and
pay due regard to his teaching, ruling, and admonitions. (2.) They must
esteem their ministers highly in love; they should greatly value the
office of the ministry, honour and love the persons of their ministers,
and show their esteem and affection in all proper ways, and this for
their work's sake, because their business is to promote the honour of
Christ and the welfare of men's souls. Note, Faithful ministers ought to
be so far from being lightly esteemed because of their work that they
should be highly esteemed on account of it. The work of the ministry is
so far from being a disgrace to those who upon other accounts deserve
esteem, that it puts an honour upon those who are faithful and diligent,
to which otherwise they could lay no claim, and will procure them that
esteem and love among good people which otherwise they could not expect.

III\. He gives divers other exhortations touching the duty Christians
owe to one another. 1. To be at peace among themselves, [Th1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#013.md). Some understand this exhortation
(according to the reading in some copies) as referring to the people's
duty to their ministers, to live peaceably with them, and not raise nor
promote dissensions at any time between minister and people, which will
certainly prove a hindrance to the success of a minister's work and the
edification of the people. This is certain, that ministers and people
should avoid every thing that tends to alienate their affections one
from another. And the people should be at peace among themselves, doing
all they can to hinder any differences from rising or continuing among
them, and using all proper means to preserve peace and harmony. 2. To
warn the unruly, [Th1 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014.md). There will
be in all societies some who walk disorderly, who go out of their rank
and station; and it is not only the duty of ministers, but of private
Christians also, to warn and admonish them. Such should be reproved for
their sin, warned of their danger, and told plainly of the injury they
do their own souls, and the hurt they may do to others. Such should be
put in mind of what they should do, and be reproved for doing otherwise.
3. To comfort the feebleminded, [Th1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014.md). By these are intended the
timorous and faint-hearted, or such as are dejected and of a sorrowful
spirit. Some are cowardly, afraid of difficulties, and disheartened at
the thoughts of hazards, and losses, and afflictions; now such should be
encouraged; we should not despise them, but comfort them; and who knows
what good a kind and comfortable word may do them? 4. To support the
weak, [Th1 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014.md). Some are not well
able to perform their work, nor bear up under their burdens; we should
therefore support them, help their infirmities, and lift at one end of
the burden, and so help to bear it. It is the grace of God, indeed, that
must strengthen and support such; but we should tell them of that grace,
and endeavour to minister of that grace to them. 5. To be patient
towards all men, [Th1 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014.md). We must
bear and forbear. We must be long-suffering, and suppress our anger, if
it begin to rise upon the apprehension of affronts or injuries; at least
we must not fail to moderate our anger: and this duty must be exercised
towards all men, good and bad, high and low. We must not be high in our
expectations and demands, nor harsh in our resentments, nor hard in our
impositions, but endeavour to make the best we can of every thing, and
think the best we can of every body. 6. Not to render evil for evil to
any man, [Th1 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#015.md). This we must look
to, and be very careful about, that is, we must by all means forbear to
avenge ourselves. If others do us an injury, this will not justify us in
returning it, in doing the same, or the like, or any other injury to
them. It becomes us to forgive, as those that are, and that hope to be,
forgiven of God. 7. Ever to follow that which is good, [Th1
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#015.md). In general, we must study to do
what is our duty, and pleasing to God, in all circumstances, whether men
do us good turns or ill turns; whatever men do to us, we must do good to
others. We must always endeavour to be beneficent and instrumental to
promote the welfare of others, both among ourselves (in the first place
to those that are of the household o faith), and then, as we have
opportunity, unto all men, [Gal 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010.md).

[1 Thessalonians 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">th1 5:16</span></span>

Here we have divers short exhortations, that will not burden our
memories, but will be of great use to direct the motions of our hearts
and lives; for the duties are of great importance, and we may observe
how they are connected together, and have a dependence upon one another.
1. Rejoice evermore, [Th1 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#016.md). This
must be understood of spiritual joy; for we must rejoice in our
creature-comforts as if we rejoiced not, and must not expect to live
many years, and rejoice in them all; but, if we do rejoice in God, we
may do that evermore. In him our joy will be full; and it is our fault
if we have not a continual feast. If we are sorrowful upon any worldly
account, yet still we may always rejoice, [Co2
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#010.md). Note, A religious life is a
pleasant life, it is a life of constant joy. 2. Pray without ceasing,
[Th1 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#017.md). Note, The way to rejoice
evermore is to pray without ceasing. We should rejoice more if we prayed
more. We should keep up stated times for prayer, and continue instant in
prayer. We should pray always, and not faint: pray without weariness,
and continue in prayer, till we come to that world where prayer shall be
swallowed up in praise. The meaning is not that men should do nothing
but pray, but that nothing else we do should hinder prayer in its proper
season. Prayer will help forward and not hinder all other lawful
business, and every good work. 3. In every thing give thanks, [Th1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#018.md). If we pray without ceasing, we
shall not want matter for thanksgiving in every thing. As we must in
every thing make our requests known to God by supplications, so we must
not omit thanksgiving, [Phi 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006.md). We
should be thankful in every condition, even in adversity as well as
prosperity. It is never so bad with us but it might be worse. If we have
ever so much occasion to make our humble complaints to God, we never can
have any reason to complain of God, and have always much reason to
praise and give thanks: the apostle says, This is the will of God in
Christ Jesus concerning us, that we give thanks, seeing God is
reconciled to us in Christ Jesus; in him, through him, and for his sake,
he allows us to rejoice evermore, and appoints us in every thing to give
thanks. It is pleasing to God. 4. Quench not the Spirit ([Th1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#019).md), for it is this Spirit of grace
and supplication that helpeth our infirmities, that assisteth us in our
prayers and thanksgivings. Christians are said to be baptized with the
Holy Ghost and with fire. He worketh as fire, by enlightening,
enlivening, and purifying the souls of men. We must be careful not to
quench this holy fire. As fire is put out by withdrawing fuel, so we
quench the Spirit if we do not stir up our spirits, and all that is
within us, to comply with the motions of the good Spirit; and as fire is
quenched by pouring water, or putting a great quantity of dirt upon it,
so we must be careful not to quench the Holy Spirit by indulging carnal
lusts and affections, or minding only earthly things. 5. Despise not
prophesyings ([Th1 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#020).md); for, if we
neglect the means of grace, we forfeit the Spirit of grace. By
prophesyings here we are to understand the preaching of the word, the
interpreting and applying of the scriptures; and this we must not
despise, but should prize and value, because it is the ordinance of God,
appointed of him for our furtherance and increase in knowledge and
grace, in holiness and comfort. We must not despise preaching, though it
be plain, and not with enticing words of men's wisdom, and though we be
told no more than what we knew before. It is useful, and many times
needful, to have our minds stirred up, our affections and resolutions
excited, to those things that we knew before to be our interest and our
duty. 6. Prove all things, but hold fast that which is good, [Th1
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#021.md). This is a needful caution, to
prove all things; for, though we must put a value on preaching, we must
not take things upon trust from the preacher, but try them by the law
and the testimony. We must search the scriptures, whether what they say
be true or not. We must not believe every spirit, but must try the
spirits. But we must not be always trying, always unsettled; no, at
length we must be settled, and hold fast that which is good. When we are
satisfied that any thing is right, and true, and good, we must hold it
fast, and not let it go, whatever opposition or whatever persecution we
meet with for the sake thereof. Note, The doctrines of human
infallibility, implicit faith, and blind obedience, are not the
doctrines of the Bible. Every Christian has and ought to have, the
judgment of discretion, and should have his senses exercised in
discerning between good and evil, truth and falsehood, [Heb
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#013.md), [Heb
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#014.md). And proving all things must be
in order to holding fast that which is good. We must not always be
seekers, or fluctuating in our minds, like children tossed to and fro
with every wind of doctrine. 7. Abstain from all appearance of evil,
[Th1 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#022.md). This is a good means to
prevent our being deceived with false doctrines, or unsettled in our
faith; for our Saviour has told us ([Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017).md), If a man will do his will, he
shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God. Corrupt affections
indulged in the heart, and evil practices allowed of in the life, will
greatly tend to promote fatal errors in the mind; whereas purity of
heart, and integrity of life, will dispose men to receive the truth in
the love of it. We should therefore abstain from evil, and all
appearances of evil, from sin, and that which looks like sin, leads to
it, and borders upon it. He who is not shy of the appearances of sin,
who shuns not the occasions of sin, and who avoids not the temptations
and approaches to sin, will not long abstain from the actual commission
of sin.

In these words, which conclude this epistle, observe,

I. Paul's prayer for them, [Th1 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023.md).
He had told them, in the beginning of this epistle, that he always made
mention of them in his prayers; and, now that he is writing to them, he
lifts up his heart to God in prayer for them. Take notice, 1. To whom
the apostle prays, namely, The very God of peace. He is the God of
grace, and the God of peace and love. He is the author of peace and
lover of concord; and by their peaceableness and unity, from God as the
author, those things would best be obtained which he prays for. 2. The
things he prays for on behalf of the Thessalonians are their
sanctification, that God would sanctify them wholly; and their
preservation, that they might be preserved blameless. He prays that they
may be wholly sanctified, that the whole man may be sanctified, and then
that the whole man, spirit, soul, and body, may be preserved: or, he
prays that they may be wholly sanctified, that is, more perfectly, for
the best are sanctified but in part while in this world; and therefore
we should pray for and press towards complete sanctification. Where the
good work of grace is begun, it shall be carried on, be protected and
preserved; and all those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus shall be
preserved to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. And because, if God
did not carry on his good work in the soul, it would miscarry, we should
pray to God to perfect his work, and preserve us blameless, free from
sin and impurity, till at length we are presented faultless before the
throne of his glory with exceeding joy.

II\. His comfortable assurance that God would hear his prayer: Faithful
is he who calleth you, who will also do it, [Th1
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#024.md). The kindness and love of God had
appeared to them in calling them to the knowledge of his truth, and the
faithfulness of God was their security that they should persevere to the
end; and therefore, the apostle assures them, God would do what he
desired; he would effect what he had promised; he would accomplish all
the good pleasure of his goodness towards them. Note, Our fidelity to
God depends upon his faithfulness to us.

III\. His request of their prayers: Brethren, pray for us, [Th1
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#025.md). We should pray for one another;
and brethren should thus express brotherly love. This great apostle did
not think it beneath him to call the Thessalonians brethren, nor to
request their prayers. Ministers stand in need of their people's
prayers; and the more people pray for their ministers the more good
ministers may have from God, and the more benefit people may receive by
their ministry.

IV\. His salutation: Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss, [Th1
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#026.md). Thus the apostle sends a
friendly salutation from himself, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, and would
have them salute each other in their names; and thus he would have them
signify their mutual love and affection to one another by the kiss of
charity ([Pe1 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#014).md), which is here
called a holy kiss, to intimate how cautious they should be of all
impurity in the use of this ceremony, then commonly practised; as it
should not be a treacherous kiss like that of Judas, so not a lascivious
kiss like that of the harlot, [Pro
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#013.md).

V. His solemn charge for the reading of this epistle, [Th1
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#027.md). This is not only an exhortation,
but an adjuration by the Lord. And this epistle was to be read to all
the holy brethren. It is not only allowed to the common people to read
the scriptures, and what none should prohibit, but it is their
indispensable duty, and what they should be persuaded to do. In order to
this, these holy oracles should not be kept concealed in an unknown
tongue, but translated into the vulgar languages, that all men, being
concerned to know the scriptures, may be able to read them, and be
acquainted with them. The public reading of the law was one part of the
worship of the sabbath among the Jews in their synagogues, and the
scriptures should be read in the public assemblies of Christians also.

VI\. The apostolical benediction that is usual in other epistles: The
grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen, [Th1
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#028.md). We need no more to make us happy
than to know that grace which our Lord Jesus Christ has manifested, be
interested in that grace which he has purchased, and partake of that
grace which dwells in him as the head of the church. This is an
ever-flowing and overflowing fountain of grace to supply all our wants.
