### [2 Chronicles Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 29:0</span></span>

We are here entering upon a pleasant scene, the good and glorious reign
of Hezekiah, in which we shall find more of God and religion than
perhaps in any of the good reigns we have yet met with; for he was a
very zealous, devout, good man, none like him. In this chapter we have
an account of the work of reformation which he set about with vigour
immediately after his accession to the crown. Here is, I. His
exhortation to the priests and Levites, when he put them in possession
of the house of God again ([Ch2
29:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#001).md). II. The care and pains which
the Levites took to cleanse the temple, and put things in order there
([Ch2 29:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#012).md). III. A solemn revival
of God's ordinances that had been neglected, in which atonement was made
for the sins of the last reign, and the wheels were set a-going again,
to the great satisfaction of king and people (v. 20-36).

[2 Chronicles 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 29:1</span></span>

Here is, I. Hezekiah's age when he came to the crown. He was twenty-five
years old. Joash, who came to the crown after two bad reigns, was but
seven years old; Josiah, who came after two bad reigns, was but eight,
which occasioned the delay of the reformation; but Hezekiah had come to
years, and so applied himself immediately to it. We may well think with
what a sorrowful heart he beheld his father's idolatry and profaneness,
how it troubled him to see the doors of the temple shut, though, while
his father lived, he durst not open them. His soul no doubt wept in
secret for it, and he vowed that when he should receive the congregation
he would redress these grievances, which made him do it with more
readiness and resolution.

II\. His general character. He did that which was right like David, [Ch2
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#002.md). Of several of his predecessors
it had been said that they did that which was right, but not like David,
not with David's integrity and zeal. But here was one that had as hearty
an affection for the ark and law of God as ever David had.

III\. His speedy application to the great work of restoring religion.
The first thing he did was to open the doors of the house of the Lord,
[Ch2 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#003.md). We are willing to hope his
father had not quite suppressed the temple service; for then the holy
fire on the altar must have gone out, and we do not read of the
re-kindling of it; but he had hindered the people from attending it, and
the priests, except such of them as were of his own party, [Kg2
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#015.md). But Hezekiah immediately threw
the church doors open, and brought in the priests and Levites. He found
Judah low and naked, yet did not make it his first business to revive
the civil interests of his kingdom, but to restore religion to its good
posture again. Those that begin with God begin at the right end of their
work, and it will prosper accordingly.

IV\. His speech to the priests and Levites. It was well known, no doubt,
that he had a real kindness for religion and was disaffected to the
corruptions of the last reign; yet we do not find the priests and
Levites making application to him for the restoration of the temple
service but he calls upon them, which, I doubt, bespeaks their coldness
as much as his zeal; and perhaps, if they had done their part with
vigour, things would not have been brought into so very bad a posture as
Hezekiah found them in. Hezekiah's exhortation to the Levites is very
pathetic.

1\. He laid before them the desolations of religion and the deplorable
state to which it was brought among them ([Ch2
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#006.md), [Ch2
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#007).md): Our fathers have trespassed. He
said not "My father," because it became him, as a son, to be as tender
as might be of his father's name, and because his father would not have
done all this if their fathers had not neglected their duty. Urijah the
priest had joined with Ahaz in setting up an idolatrous altar. He
complained, (1.) That the house of God had been deserted: They have
forsaken God, and turned their backs upon his habitation. Note, Those
that turn their backs upon God's ordinances may truly be said to forsake
God himself. (2.) That the instituted worship of God there had been let
fall. The lamps were not lighted, and incense was not burnt. There are
still such neglects as these, and they are no less culpable, when the
word is not duly read and opened (for that was signified by the lighting
of the lamps) and when prayers and praises are not duly offered up, for
that was signified by the burning of incense.

2\. He showed the sad consequences of the neglect and decay of religion
among them, [Ch2 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#008.md). 9. This was the
cause of all the calamities they had lain under. God had in anger
delivered them to trouble, to the sword, and to captivity. When we are
under the rebukes of God's providence it is good for us to enquire
whether we have not neglected God's ordinances and whether the
controversy he has with us may not be traced to this neglect.

3\. He declared his own full purpose and resolution to revive religion
and make it his business to promote it ([Ch2
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#010).md): "It is in my heart (that is, I
am fully resolved) to make a covenant with the Lord God of Israel (that
is, to worship him only, and in that way which he has appointed); for I
am sure that, otherwise, his fierce anger will not turn away from us."
This covenant he would not only make himself, but bring his people into
the bond of.

4\. He engaged and excited the Levites and priests to do their duty on
this occasion. This he begins with ([Ch2
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#005).md); this he ends with, [Ch2
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#011.md). He called them Levites to
remind them of their obligation to God, called them his sons to remind
them of the relation to himself, that he expected that, as a son with
the father, they should serve with him in the reformation of the land.
(1.) he told them what was their duty, to sanctify themselves first (by
repenting of their neglects, reforming their own hearts and lives, and
renewing their covenants with God to do their duty better for the time
to come), and then to sanctify the house of God, as his servants, to
make it clean from every thing that was disagreeable, either through the
disuse or the profanation of it, and to set it up for the purposes for
which it was made. (2.) He stirred them up to do it ([Ch2
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#011).md): "Be not now negligent, or
remiss, in your duty. Let not this good work be retarded through your
carelessness." Be not deceived, so the margin. Note, Those that by their
negligence in the service of God think to mock God, and put a cheat upon
him, do but deceive themselves, and put a damning cheat upon their own
souls. Be not secure (so some), as if there were no urgent call to do it
or no danger in not doing it. Note, Men's negligence in religion is
owing to their carnal security. The consideration he quickens them with
is derived from their office. God had herein put honour upon them: He
has chosen you to stand before him. God therefore expected work from
them. They were not chosen to be idle, to enjoy the dignity and leave
the duty to be done by others, but to serve him and to minister to him.
They must therefore be ashamed of their late remissness, and, now that
the doors of the temple were opened again, must set about their work
with double diligence.

[2 Chronicles 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 29:12</span></span>

We have here busy work, good work, and needful work, the cleansing of
the house of the Lord.

I. The persons employed in this work were the priests and Levites, who
should have kept the temple clean, but, not having done that, were
concerned to make it clean. Several of the Levites are here named, two
of each of the three principal houses, Kohath, Gershon, and Merari ([Ch2
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#012).md), and two of each of the three
families of singers, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, [Ch2
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#013.md), [Ch2
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#014.md). We cannot think these are named
merely because they were chief in place (for then surely the high
priest, or some of the heads of the courses of the priests, would have
been mentioned), but because they were more zealous and active than the
rest. When God has work to do he will raise up leading men to preside in
it. And it is not always that the first in place and rank are most fit
for service or most forward to it. These Levites not only bestirred
themselves, but gathered their brethren, and quickened them to do
according to the commandment of the king by the word of the Lord.
Observe, They did according to the king's command, but with an eye to
God's word. The king commanded them what was already their duty by the
word of God, and, in doing it, they regarded God's word as a rule to
them and the king's commandment as a spur to them.

II\. The work was cleansing the house of God, 1. From the common dirt it
had contracted while it was shut up - dust, and cobwebs, and the rust of
the vessels. 2. From the idols and idolatrous altars that were set up in
it, which, though kept ever so neat, were a greater pollution to it than
if it had been made the common sewer of the city. The priests were none
of them mentioned as leading men in this work, yet none but they durst
go into the inner part of the house, no, not to cleanse it, which they
did, and perhaps the high priest into the holy of holies, to cleanse
that. And, though the Levites had the honour to be the leaders in the
work, they did not disdain to be servitors to the priests according to
their office; for what filth the priests brought into the court the
Levites carried to the brook Kidron. Let not men's usefulness, be it
ever so eminent, make them forget their place.

III\. The expedition with which they did this work was very remarkable.
They began on the first day of the first month, a happy beginning of the
new-year, and one that promised a good year. Thus should every year
begin with the reformation of what is amiss, and the purging away, by
true repentance, of all the defilements contracted the foregoing year.
In eight days they cleared and cleansed the temple, and in eight days
more the courts of the temple, [Ch2
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#017.md). Let those that do good work
learn to rid work and get it done. Let what is amiss be amended quickly.

IV\. The report they made of it to Hezekiah was very agreeable, [Ch2
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#018.md), [Ch2
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#019.md). They gave him an account of
what they had done, because it was he that set them on work, boasted not
of their own care and pains, nor did they come to him to be paid, but to
let him know that all things that had been profaned were now sanctified
according to law, and were ready to be used again whenever he pleased.
They knew the good king had set his heart upon God's altar, and longed
to be attending that, and therefore they insisted most upon the
readiness they had put that into - that the vessels for the altar were
scoured and brightened. Those vessels which Ahaz, in his transgression,
had cast away as vessels in which there was no pleasure, they gathered
together, sanctified them, and laid them in their place before the
altar. Though the vessels of the sanctuary may be profaned for a while,
God will find a time and a way to sanctify them. Neither his ordinances
nor his people shall be suffered to fail for ever.

[2 Chronicles 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 29:20</span></span>

The temple being cleansed, we have here an account of the good use that
was immediately made of it. A solemn assembly was called to meet the
king at the temple, the very next day ([Ch2
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#020).md); and very glad, no doubt, all
the good people in Jerusalem were, when it was said, Let us go up to the
house of the Lord, [Psa 122:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001.md). As soon
as Hezekiah heard that the temple was ready for him he lost no time, but
made it appear that he was ready for it. He rose early to go up to the
house of the Lord, earlier on that day than on other days, to show that
his heart was upon his work there. Now this day's work was to look two
ways: -

I. Atonement must be made for the sins of the last reign. They thought
it not enough to lament and forsake those sins, but they brought a
sin-offering. Even our repentance and reformation will not obtain pardon
but in and through Christ, who was made sin (that is, a sin-offering)
for us. No peace but through his blood, no, not for penitents. Observe,
1. The sin-offering was for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for
Judah ([Ch2 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#021).md), that is, to make
atonement for the sins of princes, priests, and people, for they had all
corrupted their way. The law of Moses appointed sacrifices to make
atonement for the sins of the whole congregation ([Lev
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013.md), [Lev
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#014.md); [Num
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#024.md), [Num
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#025).md), that the national judgments
which their national sins deserved might be turned away. For this
purpose we must now have an eye to Christ the great propitiation, as
well as for the remission and salvation of particular persons. 2. The
law appointed only one goat for a sin-offering, as on the day of
atonement ([Lev 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#015).md) and on such
extraordinary occasions as this, [Num
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#024.md). But they here offered seven
([Ch2 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#021).md), because the sins of the
congregation had been very great and long continued in. Seven is a
number of perfection. Our great sin-offering is but one, yet that one
perfects for ever those that are sanctified. 3. The king and the
congregation (that is, the representatives of the congregation) laid
their hands on the heads of the goats that were for the sin-offering
([Ch2 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#023).md), thereby owning
themselves guilty before God and expressing their desire that the guilt
of the sinner might be transferred to the sacrifice. By faith we lay our
hands on the Lord Jesus, and so receive the atonement, [Rom
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#011.md). 4. Burnt-offerings were offered
with the sin-offerings, seven bullocks, seven rams, and seven lambs. The
intention of the burnt-offerings was to give glory to the God of Israel,
whom they owned as the only true God, which it was proper to do at the
same time that they were by the sin-offering making atonement for their
offences. The blood of those, as well as of the sin-offering, was
sprinkled upon the altar ([Ch2 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#022).md),
to make reconciliation for all Israel ([Ch2
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#024).md), and not for Judah only. Christ
is a propitiation, not for the sins of Israel only, but of the whole
world, [Jo1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001.md), [Jo1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002.md). 5. While the offerings were
burning upon the altar the Levites sang the song of the Lord ([Ch2
29:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#027).md), the Psalms composed by David
and Asaph ([Ch2 29:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#030).md), accompanied by
the musical instruments which God by his prophets had commanded the use
of ([Ch2 29:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#025).md), and which had been
long neglected. Even sorrow for sin must not put us out of tune for
praising God. By faith we must rejoice in Christ Jesus as our
righteousness; and our prayers and praises must ascend with his
offering, to be accepted only in virtue of it. 6. The king and all the
congregation testified their consent to and concurrence in all that was
done, by bowing their heads and worshipping, expressing an awful
veneration of the divine Majesty, by postures of adoration. This is
taken notice of, [Ch2 29:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#028.md). It is
not enough for us to be where God is worshipped, if we do not ourselves
worship him, and that not with bodily exercise only, which profits
little, but with the heart.

II\. The solemnities of this day did likewise look forward. The temple
service was to be set up again, that it might be continually kept up;
and this Hezekiah calls them to, [Ch2
29:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#031.md). "Now that you have consecrated
yourselves to the Lord - have both made an atonement and made a covenant
by sacrifice, are solemnly reconciled and engaged to him - now come
near, and bring sacrifices." Note, Our covenant with God must be pursued
and improved in communion with him. Having consecrated ourselves, in the
first place, to the Lord, we must bring the sacrifices of prayer, and
praise, and alms, to his house. Now, in this work, it was found.

1\. That the people were free. Being called to it by the king, they
brought in their offerings, though not in such abundance as in the
glorious days of Solomon (for Judah was now diminished, impoverished,
and brought low), but according to what they had, and as much as one
could expect considering their poverty and the great decay of piety
among them. (1.) Some were so generous as to bring burnt-offerings,
which were wholly consumed to the honour of God, and of which the
offerer had no part. Of this sort there were seventy bullocks, 100 rams,
and 200 lambs, [Ch2 29:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#032). (2..md) Others
brought peace-offerings and thank-offerings, the fat of which was burnt
upon the altar, and the flesh divided between the priests and the
offerers, [Ch2 29:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#035.md). Of this sort
there were 600 oxen and 3000 sheep, [Ch2
29:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#033.md). Perhaps the remembrance of
their sin in sacrificing on the high places made them more willing to
bring their sacrifices now to God's altar.

2\. That the priests were few, too few for the service, [Ch2
29:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#034.md). Many of them, it is likely,
were suspended and laid aside as polluted and uncanonical, for having
sacrificed to idols in the last reign, and the rest had not the zeal
that one might have expected upon such an occasion. They thought that
the king needed not to be so forward, that there was no necessity for
such haste in opening the doors of the temple, and therefore they took
no care to sanctify themselves, and being unsanctified, and so
unqualified, they made that their excuse for being absent from the
service; as if their offence would be their defence. It is recorded
here, to the perpetual shame of the priests, that, though they were so
well provided for out of the offerings of the Lord made by fire, yet
they did not mind their business. Here was work to do, and there wanted
proper hands to do it.

3\. That the Levites were forward. They had been more upright in heart
to sanctify themselves than the priests ([Ch2
29:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#034).md), were better affected to the
work and better prepared and qualified for it. This was their praise,
and, in recompence for it, they had the honour to be employed in that
which was the priests' work: they helped them to flay the offerings.
This was not according to the law ([Lev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#005.md), [Lev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#006).md), but the irregularity was
dispensed with in cases of necessity, and thus encouragement was given
to the faithful zealous Levites and a just disgrace put upon the
careless priests. What the Levites wanted in the ceremonial advantages
of their birth and consecration was abundantly made up in their eminent
qualifications of skill and will to do the work.

4\. That all were pleased. The king and all the people rejoiced in this
blessed turn of affairs and the new face of religion which the kingdom
had put on, [Ch2 29:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#036.md). Two things in
this matter pleased them: - (1.) That it was soon brought about: The
thing was done suddenly, in a little time, with a great deal of ease,
and without any opposition. Those that go about the work of God in faith
and with resolution will find that there is not that difficulty in it
which they sometimes imagine, but it will be a pleasing surprise to them
to see how soon it is done. (2.) That the hand of God was plainly in it:
God had prepared the people by the secret influences of his grace, so
that many of those who had in the last reign doted on the idolatrous
altars were now as much in love with God's altar. This change, which God
wrought on their minds, did very much expedite and facilitate the work.
Let magistrates and ministers do their part towards the reforming of a
land, and ascribe to him the glory of what is done, especially when it
is done suddenly and is a pleasing surprise. This is the Lord's doing,
and it is marvellous.
