### [Ezekiel Chapter 45](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 45:0</span></span>

In this chapter is further represented to the prophet, in vision, I. The
division of the holy land, so much for the temple, and the priests that
attended the service of it ([Eze
45:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001).md), so much for the Levites ([Eze
45:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#005).md), so much for the city ([Eze
45:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#006).md), so much for the prince, and the
residue to the people ([Eze 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#007.md), [Eze
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#008).md). II. The ordinances of justice
that were given both to prince and people ([Eze
45:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#009).md). III. The oblations they were
to offer, and the prince's part in those oblations ([Eze
45:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#013).md). Particularly in the
beginning of the year ([Eze 45:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#018).md)
and in the passover, and the feast of tabernacles ([Eze
45:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#021).md). And all this seems to point
at the new church-state that should be set up under the gospel, which,
both for extent and for purity, should far exceed that of the Old
Testament.

[Ezekiel 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 45:1</span></span>

Directions are here given for the dividing of the land after their
return to it; and, God having warranted them to do it, would be an act
of faith, and not of folly, thus to divide it before they had it. And it
would be welcome news to the captives to hear that they should not only
return to their own land, but that, whereas they were now but few in
number, they should increase and multiply, so as to replenish it. But
this never had its accomplishment in the Jewish state after the return
out of captivity, but was to be fulfilled in the model of the Christian
church, which was perfectly new (as this division of the land was quite
different from that in Joshua's time) and much enlarged by the accession
of the Gentiles to it; and it will be perfected in the heavenly kingdom,
of which the land of Canaan had always been a type. Now, 1. Here is the
portion of land assigned to the sanctuary, in the midst of which the
temple was to be built, with all its courts and purlieus; the rest round
about it was for the priests. This is called ([Eze
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001).md) an oblation to the Lord; for
what is given in works of piety, for the maintenance and support of the
worship of God and the advancement of religion, God accepts as given to
him, if it be done with a single eye. It is a holy portion of the land,
which is to be set out first, as the first-fruits that sanctify the
lump. The appropriating of lands for the support of religion and the
ministry is an act of piety that bids as fair for perpetuity, and the
benefit of posterity, as any. This holy portion of the land was to be
measured, and the borders of it fixed, that the sanctuary itself might
not have more than its share and in time engross the whole land. So far
the lands of the church shall extend and no further; as in our own
kingdom donations to the church were of old limited by the statute of
mortmain. The lands here allotted to the sanctuary were 25,000 reeds (so
our translation makes it, though some make them only cubits) in length,
and 10,000 in breadth-about eighty miles one way and thirty miles
another way (say some); twenty-five miles one way and ten miles the
other way, so others. The priests and Levites that were to come near to
minister were to have their dwellings in this portion of the land that
was round about the sanctuary, that they might be near their work;
whereas by the distribution of land in Joshua's time the cities of the
priests and Levites were dispersed all the nation over. This intimates
that gospel ministers should reside upon their charge; where their
service lies there must they live. 2. Next to the lands of the sanctuary
the city-lands are assigned, in which the holy city was to be built, and
with the issues and profits of which the citizens were to be maintained
([Eze 45:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#006).md): It shall be for the whole
house of Israel, not appropriated, as before, to one tribe or two, but
some of all the tribes shall dwell in the city, as we find they did,
[Neh 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001.md), [Neh
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#002.md). The portion for the city was
fully as long, but only half as broad, as that for the sanctuary; for
the city was enriched by trade and therefore had the less need of lands.
3. The next allotment after the church-lands and the city-lands is of
the crown-lands, [Eze 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#007.md), [Eze
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#008.md). Here is no admeasurement of
these, but they are said to lie on the one side and on the other side of
the church-lands and city-lands, to intimate that the prince with his
wealth and power was to be a protection to both. Some make the prince's
share equal to the church's and city's share both together; others make
it to be a thirteenth part of the rest of the land, the other twelve
parts being for the twelve tribes. The prince that attends continually
to the administration of public affairs must have wherewithal to support
his dignity, and have abundance, that he may not be in temptation to
oppress the people, which yet with many does not prevent that; but the
grace of God shall prevent it, for it is promised here, My princes shall
no more oppress my people; for God will make the officers peace and the
exactors righteousness. Notwithstanding this, we find that after the
return of the Jews to their own land the princes were complained of for
their exactions. But Nehemiah was one that did not do as the former
governors, and yet kept a handsome court, [Neh
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#015.md), [Neh
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#018.md). But so much is said of the
prince in this mystical holy state, to intimate that in the
gospel-church magistrates should be as nursing fathers to it and
Christian princes its patrons and protectors; and the holy religion they
profess, as far as they are subject to the power of it, will restrain
them from oppressing God's people, because they are more his people than
theirs. 4. The rest of the lands were to be distributed to the people
according to their tribes, who had reason to think themselves well
settled, when they had both the testimony of Israel and the throne of
judgment so near them.

[Ezekiel 45:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 45:9</span></span>

We have here some general rules of justice laid down both for prince and
people, the rules of distributive and commutative justice; for godliness
without honesty is but a form of godliness, will neither please God nor
avail to the benefit of any people. Be it therefore enacted, by the
authority of the church's King and God, 1. That princes do not oppress
their subjects, but duly and faithfully administer justice among them
([Eze 45:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#009).md): "Let it suffice you, O
princes of Israel! that you have been oppressive to the people and have
enriched yourselves by spoil and violence, that you have so long fleeced
the flock instead of feeding them, and henceforward do so no more."
Note, Even princes and great men that have long done amiss must at
length think it time, high time, to reform and amend; for no
prescription will justify a wrong. Instead of saying that they have been
long accustomed to oppress, and therefore may persist in it, for the
custom will bear them out, they should say that they have been long
accustomed to it and therefore, as here, Let the time pass suffice, and
let them now remove violence and spoil; let them drop wrongful demands,
cancel wrongful usages, and turn out those from employments under them
that do violence. Let them take away their exactions, ease their
subjects of those taxes which they find lie heavily upon them, and let
them execute judgment and justice according to the law, as the duty of
their place requires. Note, All princes, but especially the princes of
Israel, are concerned to do justice; for of their people God says, They
are my people, and they in a special manner rule for God. 2. That one
neighbour do not cheat another in commerce ([Eze
45:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#010).md): You shall have just balances,
in which to weigh both money and goods, a just ephah for dry measure of
corn and flour, a just bath for the measure of liquids, wine, and oil;
and the ephah and bath shall be one measure, the tenth part of a chomer,
or cor, [Eze 45:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#011.md). So that the ephah
and bath contained (as the learned Dr. Cumberland has computed) seven
wine gallons and four pints, and something more. An omer was but the
tenth part of an ephah ([Exo 16:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#036).md)
and the one hundredth part of a chomer, or homer, and contained about
six pints. The shekel is here settled ([Eze
45:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#013).md); it is twenty jerahs, just half
a Roman ounce, in our money 2s. 4 1/4d. and almost the eighth part of a
farthing, as the aforesaid learned man exactly computes it. By the
shekels the maneh, or pound, was reckoned, which, when it was set for a
mere weight (says bishop Cumberland), without respect to coinage,
contained just 100 shekels, as appears by comparing [Kg1
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#017.md), where it is said three manehs,
or pounds, of gold, went to one shield, with the parallel place, [Ch2
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#016.md), where it is said 300 shekels of
gold went to one shield. But when the maneh is set for a sum of money or
coin it contains but sixty shekels, as appears here, where twenty
shekels, twenty-five shekels, and fifteen shekels, which in all make
sixty, shall be the maneh. But it is thus reckoned because they had one
piece of money that weighed twenty shekels, another twenty-five, another
fifteen, all of which made up one pound, as a learned writer here
observes. Note, It concerns God's Israel to be very honest and just in
all their dealings, very punctual and exact in rendering to all their
due, and very cautious to do wrong to none, because otherwise they spoil
the acceptableness of their profession with God and the reputation of it
before men.

[Ezekiel 45:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 45:13</span></span>

Having laid down the rules of the righteousness toward men, which is
really a branch off true religion, he comes next to give some directions
for their religion towards God, which is a branch of universal
righteousness.

I. It is required that they offer an oblation to the Lord out of what
they have ([Eze 45:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#013).md): All the people
of the land must give an oblation, [Eze
45:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#016.md). As God's tenants, they must pay
a quit-rent to their great landlord. They had offered an oblation out of
their real estates ([Eze 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001).md), a holy
portion of their land; now they are directed to offer an oblation out of
their personal estates, their goods and chattels, as an acknowledgement
of their receivings from him, their dependence on him, and their
obligations to him. Note, Whatever our substance is we must honour God
with it, by giving him his dues out of it. Not that God has need of or
may be benefited by any thing that we can give him, [Psa
50:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#009.md). No; it is but an oblation; we
only offer it to him; the benefit of it returns back to ourselves, to
his poor, who, as our neighbours, are ourselves, or to his ministers who
serve continually for our good.

II\. The proportion of this oblation is here determined, which was not
done by the law of Moses. No mention is made of the title, but only of
this oblation. And the quantum of this is thus settled: - 1. Out of
their corn they were to offer a sixtieth part; out of every homer of
wheat and barley, which contained ten ephahs, they were to offer the
sixth part of one ephah, which was a sixtieth part of the whole, [Eze
45:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#013.md). 2. Out of their oil (and
probably their wine too) they were to offer a hundredth part, for this
oblation; out of every cor, or homer, which contained ten baths they
were to offer the tenth part of one bath, [Eze
45:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#014.md). This was given to the altar;
for in eery meat-offering there was flour mingled with oil. 3. Out of
their flocks they were to give one lamb out of 200; that was the
smallest proportion of all, [Eze
45:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#015.md). But it must be out of the fat
pastures of Israel. They must not offer to God that which was taken up
from the common, but the fattest and best they had, for burnt-offerings
and peace-offerings: the former were offered for the giving of glory to
God, the latter for the fetching in of mercy, grace, and peace, from
God, and in our spiritual sacrifices these are our two great errands at
the throne of grace; but, in order to the acceptance of both, these
sacrifices were to make reconciliation for them. Christ is our sacrifice
of atonement, by whom reconciliation is made, and to him we must have an
eye in our sacrifices of acknowledgment.

III\. This oblation must be given for the prince in Israel, [Eze
45:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#016.md). Some read it to the prince, and
understand it of Christ, who is indeed the prince in Israel, to whom we
must offer our oblations, and into whose hands we must put them, to be
presented to the Father. Or, They shall give it with the prince; every
private person shall bring his oblation, to be offered with that of the
prince; for it follows ([Eze 45:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#017).md).
It shall be the prince's part to provide all the offerings, to make
reconciliation for the house of Israel. The people were to bring their
oblations to him according to the foregoing rules, and he was to bring
them to the sanctuary, and to make up what fell short out of his own.
Note, It is the duty of rulers to take care of religion, and to see that
the duties of it be regularly and carefully performed by those under
their charge, and that nothing be wanting that is requisite thereto: the
magistrate is the keeper of both tables; and it is a happy thing when
those that are above others in power and dignity go before them in the
service of God.

IV\. Some particular solemnities are here appointed.

1\. Here is one in the beginning of the year, which seems to be
altogether new, and not instituted by the law of Moses; it is the annual
solemnity of cleansing the sanctuary. (1.) On the first day of the first
month (upon new-year's day) they were to offer a sacrifice for the
cleansing of the sanctuary ([Eze
45:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#018).md), that is, to make atonement for
the iniquity of the holy things the year past, that they might bring
none of the guilt of them into the services of the new year, and to
implore grace for the preventing of that iniquity, and for the better
performance of the service of the sanctuary the ensuing year. And, in
token of this, the blood of this sin-offering was to be put upon the
posts of the gate of the inner court ([Eze
45:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#019).md), to signify that by it
atonement was intended to be made for the sins of all the servants that
attended that house, priests, Levites, and people, even the sins that
were found in all their services. Note, Even sanctuaries on earth need
cleansing, frequent cleansing; that above needs none. Those what worship
God together should often join in renewing their repentance for their
manifold defects, and applying the blood of Christ for the pardon of
them, and in renewing their covenants to be more careful for the future;
and it is very seasonable to begin the year with this work, as Hezekiah
did when it had been long neglected, [Ch2
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#017.md). They were here appointed to
cleanse the sanctuary upon the first day of the month, because on the
fourteenth day of the month they were to eat the passover, an ordinance
which, of all Old Testament institutions, had most in it of Christ and
gospel grace, and therefore it was very fit that they should begin to
prepare for it a fortnight before by cleansing the sanctuary. (2.) This
sacrifice was to be repeated on the seventh day of the first month, [Eze
45:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#020.md). And then it was intended to
make atonement for every one that errs, and for him that is simple.
Note, He that sins errs and is simple; he mistakes, he goes out of the
way, and shows himself to be foolish and unwise. But here it is spoken
of those sins which are committed through ignorance, mistake, or
inadvertency, whether by any of the priests, or of the Levites, or of
the people. Sacrifices were appointed to atone for such sins as men were
surprised into, or did before they were aware, which they would not have
done if they had known and remembered aright, which they were overtaken
in, and for which, afterwards, they condemn themselves. But for
presumptuous sins, committed with a high hand, there was no sacrifice
appointed, [Num 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#030.md). By these
repeated sacrifices you shall reconcile the house, that is, God will be
reconciled to it, and continue the tokens of his presence in it, and
will let it alone this year also.

2\. The passover was to be religiously observed at the time appointed,
[Eze 45:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#021.md). Christ is our passover,
that is sacrificed for us. We celebrate the memorial of that sacrifice
and feast upon it, triumphing in our deliverance out of the Egyptian
slavery of sin and our preservation from the sword of the destroying
angel, the sword of divine justice, in the Lord's supper, which is our
passover-feast, as the whole Christian life is, and must be, the feast
of unleavened bread. It is here appointed that the prince shall prepare
a sin-offering, to be offered for himself and the people, a bullock on
the first day ([Eze 45:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#022).md) and a kid
of the goats every other day ([Eze
45:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#023).md), to teach us, in all our
attendance upon God for communion with him, to have an eye to the great
sin-offering, by which transgression was finished and an everlasting
righteousness brought in. On every day of the feast there was to be a
burnt-offering, purely for the honour of God, of no less than seven
bullocks and seven rams, with their meat-offering, which were wholly
consumed upon the altar, and yet no waste, [Eze
45:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#023.md), [Eze
45:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#024.md).

3\. The feast of tabernacles; that is spoken of next ([Eze
45:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#025).md), and there is no mention of the
feast of pentecost, which came between that of the passover and that of
tabernacles. Orders are here given (above what were given by the law of
Moses) for the same sacrifices to be offered during the seven days of
the passover. See the deficiency of the legal sacrifices for sin; they
were therefore often repeated, not only every year, but every feast,
every day of the feast, because they could not make the comers thereunto
perfect, [Heb 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md), [Heb
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#003.md). See the necessity of our
frequently repeating the same religious exercises. Though the sacrifice
of atonement is offered once for all, yet the sacrifices of
acknowledgement, that of a broken heart, that of a thankful heart, those
spiritual sacrifices which are acceptable to God through Christ Jesus,
must be every day offered. We should, as here, fall into a method of
holy duties, and keep to it.
