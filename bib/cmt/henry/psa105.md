### [Psalms Chapter 105](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 105:0</span></span>

Some of the psalms of praise are very short, others very long, to teach
us that, in our devotions, we should be more observant how our hearts
work than how the time passes and neither overstretch ourselves by
coveting to be long nor over-stint ourselves by coveting to be short,
but either the one or the other as we find in our hearts to pray. This
is a long psalm; the general scope is the same with most of the psalms,
to set forth the glory of God, but the subject-matter is particular.
Every time we come to the throne of grace we may, if we please, furnish
ourselves out of the word of God (out of the history of the New
Testament, as this out of the history of the Old) with new songs, with
fresh thoughts - so copious, so various, so inexhaustible is the
subject. In the foregoing psalm we are taught to praise God for his
wondrous works of common providence with reference to the world in
general. In this we are directed to praise him for his special favours
to his church. We find the first eleven verses of this psalm in the
beginning of that psalm which David delivered to Asaph to be used (as it
should seem) in the daily service of the sanctuary when the ark was
fixed in the place he had prepared for it, by which it appears both who
penned it and when and upon what occasion it was penned, [Ch1
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#007.md), etc. David by it designed to
instruct his people in the obligations they lay under to adhere
faithfully to their holy religion. Here is the preface ([Psa
105:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001).md) and the history itself in
several articles. I. God's covenant with the patriarchs ([Psa
105:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#008).md). II. His care of them while
they were strangers ([Psa 105:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#012).md).
III. His raising up Joseph to be the shepherd and stone of Israel ([Psa
105:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#016).md). IV. The increase of Israel
in Egypt and their deliverance out of Egypt (v. 23-38). V. The care he
took of them in the wilderness and their settlement in Canaan ([Psa
105:39-45](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#039).md). In singing this we must
give to God the glory of his wisdom and power, his goodness and
faithfulness, must look upon ourselves as concerned in the affairs of
the Old Testament church, both because to it were committed the oracles
of God, which are our treasure, and because out of it Christ arose, and
these things happened to it for ensamples.

[Psalms 105:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 105:1</span></span>

Our devotion is here warmly excited; and we are stirred up, that we may
stir up ourselves to praise God. Observe,

I. The duties to which we are here called, and they are many, but the
tendency of them all is to give unto God the glory due unto his name. 1.
We must give thanks to him, as one who has always been our bountiful
benefactor and requires only that we give him thanks for his favours -
poor returns for rich receivings. 2. Call upon his name, as one whom you
depend upon for further favours. Praying for further mercies is accepted
as an acknowledgment of former mercies. Because he has inclined his ear
unto me, therefore will I call upon him. 3. Make known his deeds ([Psa
105:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001).md), that others may join with you
in praising him. Talk of all his wondrous works ([Psa
105:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#002).md), as we talk of things that we
are full of, and much affected with, and desire to fill others with.
God's wondrous works ought to be the subject of our familiar discourses
with our families and friends, and we should talk of them as we sit in
the house and as we go by the way ([Deu
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#007).md), not merely for entertainment,
but for the exciting of devotion and the encouraging of our own and
others' faith and hope in God. Even sacred things may be the matter of
common talk, provided it be with due reverence. 4. Sing psalms to God's
honour, as those that rejoice in him, and desire to testify that joy for
the encouragement of others and to transmit it to posterity, as
memorable things anciently were handed down by songs, when writing was
scarce. 5. Glory in his holy name; let those that are disposed to glory
not boast of their own accomplishments and achievements, but of their
acquaintance with God and their relation to him, [Jer
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#023.md), [Jer
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#024.md). Praise you his holy name, so
some; but it comes all to one, for in glorying in him we give glory to
him. 6. Seek him; place your happiness in him, and then pursue that
happiness in all the ways that he has appointed. Seek the Lord and his
strength, that is, the ark of his strength; seek him in the sanctuary,
in the way wherein he has appointed us to seek him. Seek his strength,
that is, his grace, the strength of his Spirit to work in you that which
is good, which we cannot do but by strength derived from him, for which
he will be enquired of. Seek the Lord and be strengthened; so divers
ancient versions read it. Those that would be strengthened in the inward
man must fetch in strength from God by faith and prayer. Seek his
strength, and then seek his face; for by his strength, we hope to
prevail with him for his favour, as Jacob did, [Hos
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#003.md). "Seek his face evermore; seek to
have his favour to eternity, and therefore continue seeking it to the
end of the time of your probation. Seek it while you live in this world,
and you shall have it while you live in the other world, and even there
shall be for ever seeking it in an infinite progression, and yet be for
ever satisfied in it." 7. Let the hearts of those rejoice that do seek
him ([Psa 105:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#003).md); for they have chosen
well, are well fixed, and well employed, and they may be sure that their
labour will not be in vain, for he will not only be found, but he will
be found the rewarder of those that diligently seek him. If those have
reason to rejoice that seek the Lord, much more those that have found
him.

II\. Some arguments to quicken us to these duties. 1. "Consider both
what he has said and what he has done to engage us for ever to him. You
will see yourselves under all possible obligations to give thanks to
him, and call upon his name, if you remember the wonders which should
make deep and durable impressions upon you, - the wonders of his
providence which he has wrought for you and those who are gone before
you, the marvellous works that he has done, which will be had in
everlasting remembrance with the thoughtful and with the grateful, - the
wonders of his law, which he has written to you, and entrusted you with,
the judgments of his mouth, as well as the judgments of his hand," [Psa
105:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#005.md). 2. "Consider the relation you
stand in to him ([Psa 105:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#006).md): You are
the seed of Abraham his servant; you are born in his house, and being
thereby entitled to the privilege of his servants, protection and
provision, you are also bound to do the duty of servants, to attend your
Master, consult his honour, obey his commands, and do what you can to
advance his interests. You are the children of Jacob his chosen, and are
chosen and beloved for the fathers' sake, and therefore ought to tread
in the steps of those whose honours you inherit. You are the children of
godly parents; do no degenerate. You are God's church upon earth, and,
if you do not praise him, who should?" 3. Consider your interest in him:
He is the Lord our God, [Psa 105:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#007.md). We
depend upon him, are devoted to him, and from him our expectation is.
Should not a people seek unto their God ([Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019).md) and praise their God? [Dan
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#004.md). He is Jehovah our God. He that is
our God is self-existent and self-sufficient, has an irresistible power
and incontestable sovereignty: His judgments are in all the earth; he
governs the whole world in wisdom, and gives law to all nations, even to
those that know him not. The earth is full of the proofs of his power.

[Psalms 105:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 105:8</span></span>

We are here taught, in praising God, to look a great way back, and to
give him the glory of what he did for his church in former ages,
especially when it was in the founding and forming, which those in its
latter ages enjoy the benefit of and therefore should give thanks for.
Doubtless we may fetch as proper matter for praise from the histories of
the gospels, and the acts of the apostles, which relate the birth of the
Christian church, as the psalmist here does from the histories of
Genesis and Exodus, which relate the birth of the Jewish church; and our
histories greatly outshine theirs. Two things are here made the subject
of praise: -

I. God's promise to the patriarchs, that great promise that he would
give to their seed the land of Canaan for an inheritance, which was a
type of the promise of eternal life made in Christ to all believers. In
all the marvellous works which God did for Israel he remembered his
covenant ([Psa 105:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#008).md) and he will
remember it for ever; it is the word which he commanded to a thousand
generations. See here the power of the promise; it is the word which he
commanded and which will take effect. See the perpetuity of the promise;
it is commanded to a thousand generations, and the entail of it shall
not be cut off. In the parallel place it is expressed as our duty ([Ch1
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#015).md), Be you mindful always of his
covenant. God will not forget it and therefore we must not. The promise
is here called a covenant, because there was something required on man's
part as the condition of the promise. Observe, 1. The persons with whom
this covenant was made - with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, grandfather,
father, and son, all eminent believers, [Heb
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#008.md), [Heb
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009.md). 2. The ratifications of the
covenant; it was made sure by all that is sacred. Is that sure which is
sworn to? It is his oath to Isaac and to Abraham. See to whom God swore
by himself, [Heb 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013.md), [Heb
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#014.md). Is that sure which has passed
into a law? He confirmed the same for a law, a law never to be repealed.
Is that sure which is reduced to a mutual contract and stipulation? This
is confirmed for an everlasting covenant, inviolable. 3. The covenant
itself: Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, [Psa
105:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#011.md). The patriarchs had a right to
it, not by providence, but by promise; and their seed should be put in
possession of it, not by the common ways of settling nations, but by
miracles; God will give it to them himself, as it were with his own
hand; it shall be given to them as their lot which God assigns them and
measures out to them, as the lot of their inheritance, a sure title, by
virtue of their birth; it shall come to them by descent, not by
purchase, by the favour of God, and not any merit of their own. Heaven
is the inheritance we have obtained, [Eph
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011.md). And this is the promise which
God has promised us (as Canaan was the promise he promised them), even
eternal life, [Jo1 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#025.md); [Tit
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002.md).

II\. His providences concerning the patriarchs while they were waiting
for the accomplishment of this promise, which represent to us the care
God takes of his people in this world, while they are yet on this side
the heavenly Canaan; for these things happened unto them for examples
and encouragements to all the heirs of promise, that life by faith as
they did.

1\. They were wonderfully protected and sheltered, and (as the Jewish
masters express it) gathered under the wings of the divine Majesty. This
is accounted for, [Psa 105:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#012.md). Here
we may observe,

(1.) How they were exposed to injuries from men. To the three renowned
patriarchs, Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, God's promises were very
rich; again and again he told them he would be their God; but his
performances in this world were so little proportionable that, if he had
not prepared for them a city in the other world, he would have been
ashamed to be called their God (see [Heb
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016).md), because he was always
generous; and yet even in this world he was not wanting to them, but
that he might appear, to do uncommon things for them, he exercised them
with uncommon trials. \[1.\] They were few, very few. Abraham was called
alone ([Isa 51:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#002).md); he had but two
sons, and one of them he cast out; Isaac had but two, and one of them
was forced for many years to flee from his country; Jacob had more, but
some of them, instead of being a defence to him, exposed him, when (as
he himself pleads, [Gen 34:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#030).md) he was
but few in number, and therefore might easily be destroyed by the
natives, he and his house. God's chosen are but a little flock, few,
very few, and yet upheld. \[2.\] They were strangers, and therefore were
the most likely to be abused and to meet with strange usage, and the
less able to help themselves. Their religion made them to be looked upon
as strangers ([Pe1 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#004).md) and to be
hooted at as speckled birds, [Jer
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#009.md). Though the whole land was theirs
by promise, yet they were so far from producing and pleading their grant
that they confessed themselves strangers in it, [Heb
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013.md). \[3.\] They were unsettled
([Psa 105:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#013).md): They went from one
nation to another, from one part of that land to another (for it was
then in the holding and occupation of divers nations, [Gen
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008.md); [Gen
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#003.md), [Gen
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#018).md); nay, from one kingdom to
another people, from Canaan to Egypt, from Egypt to the land of the
Philistines, which could not but weaken and expose them; yet they were
forced to it by famine. Note, Though frequent removals are neither
desirable nor commendable, yet sometimes there is a just and necessary
occasion for them, and they may be the lot of some of the best men.

(2.) How they were guarded by the special providence of God, the wisdom
and power of which were the more magnified by their being so many ways
exposed, [Psa 105:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#014.md), [Psa
105:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#015.md). They were not able to help
themselves and yet, \[1.\] No men were suffered to wrong them, but even
those that hated them, and would gladly have done them a mischief, had
their hands tied, and could not do what they would. This may refer to
[Gen 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#005.md), where we find that the
terror of God (an unaccountable restraint) was upon the cities that were
round about them, so that, though provoked, they did not pursue after
the sons of Jacob. \[2.\] Even crowned heads, that did offer to wrong
them, were not only checked and chidden for it, but controlled and
baffled: He reproved kings for their sakes in dreams and visions,
saying, "Touch not my anointed; it is at your peril if you do, nay, it
shall not be in your power to do it; do my prophets no harm." Pharaoh
king of Egypt was plagued ([Gen 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#017).md)
and Abimelech king of Gerar was sharply rebuked ([Gen
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#006).md) for doing wrong to Abraham.
Note, First, Even kings themselves are liable to God's rebukes if they
do wrong. Secondly, God's prophets are his anointed, for they have the
unction of the Spirit, that oil of gladness, [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027.md). Thirdly, Those that offer to
touch God's prophets, with design to harm them, may expect to hear of it
one way or other. God is jealous for his prophets; whoso touches them
touches the apple of his eye. Fourthly, Even those that touch the
prophets, nay that kill the prophets (as many did), cannot do them any
harm, any real harm. Lastly, God's anointed prophets are dearer to him
than anointed kings themselves. Jeroboam's hand was withered when it was
stretched out against a prophet.

2\. They were wonderfully provided for and supplied. And here also, (1.)
They were reduced to great extremity. Even in Canaan, the land of
promise, he called for a famine, [Psa
105:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#016.md). Note, All judgments are at
God's call, and no place is exempt from their visitation and
jurisdiction when God sends them forth with commission. To try the faith
of the patriarchs, God broke the whole staff of bread, even in that good
land, that they might plainly see God designed them a better country
than that was. (2.) God graciously took care for their relief. It was in
obedience to his precept, and in dependence upon his promise, that they
were now sojourners in Canaan, and therefore he could not in honour
suffer any evil to befal them or any good thing to be wanting to them.
As he restrained one Pharaoh from doing them wrong, so he raised up
another to do them a kindness, by preferring and entrusting Joseph, of
whose story we have here an abstract. He was to be the shepherd and
stone of Israel and to save that holy seed alive, [Gen
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024.md); [Gen
50:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#020.md). In order to this, \[1.\] He was
humbled, greatly humbled ([Psa 105:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#017.md),
[Psa 105:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#018).md): God sent a man before
them, even Joseph. Many years before the famine began, he was sent
before them, to nourish them in the famine; so vast are the foresights
and forecasts of Providence, and so long its reaches. But in what
character did he go to Egypt who was to provide for the reception of the
church there? He went not in quality of an ambassador, no, nor so much
as a factor or commissary; but he was sold thither for a servant, a
slave for term of life, without any prospect of being ever set at
liberty. This was low enough, and, one would think, set him far enough
from any probability of being great. And yet he was brought lower; he
was made a prisoner ([Psa 105:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#018).md): His
feet they hurt with fetters. Being unjustly charged with a crime no less
heinous than a rape upon his mistress, the iron entered into his soul,
that is, was very painful to him; and the false accusation which was the
cause of his imprisonment did in a special manner grieve him, and went
to his heart; yet all this was the way to his preferment. \[2.\] He was
exalted, highly exalted. He continued a prisoner, neither tried nor
bailed, until the time appointed of God for his release ([Psa
105:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#019).md), when his word came, that is,
his interpretations of the dreams came to pass, and the report thereof
came to Pharaoh's ears by the chief butler. And then the word of the
Lord cleared him; that is, the power God gave him to foretel things to
come rolled away the reproach his mistress had loaded him with; for it
could not be thought that God would give such a power to so bad a man as
he was represented to be. God's word tried him, tried his faith and
patience, and then it came in power to give command for his release.
There is a time set when God's word will come for the comfort of all
that trust in it, [Hab 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003.md). At the end
it shall speak, and not lie. God gave the word, and then the king sent
and loosed him; for the king's heart is in the hand of the Lord.
Pharaoh, finding him to be a favourite of Heaven, First, Discharged him
from his imprisonment ([Psa 105:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#020).md):
He let him go free. God has often, by wonderful turns of providence,
pleaded the cause of oppressed innocency. Secondly, He advanced him to
the highest posts of honour, [Psa
105:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#021.md), [Psa
105:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#022.md). He made him lord high
chamberlain of his household (he made him lord of his house); nay, he
put him into the office of lord-treasurer, the ruler of all his
substance. He made him prime-minister of state, lord-president of his
council, to command his princes at his pleasure and teach them wisdom,
and general of his forces. According to thy word shall all my people be
ruled, [Gen 41:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#040.md), [Gen
41:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#043.md), [Gen
41:44](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#044.md). He made him lord chief justice,
to judge even his senators and punish those that were disobedient. In
all this Joseph was designed to be, 1. A father to the church that then
was, to save the house of Israel from perishing by the famine. He was
made great, that he might do good, especially in the household of faith.
2. A figure of Christ that was to come, who, because he humbled himself
and took upon him the form of a servant, was highly exalted, and has all
judgment committed to him. Joseph being thus sent before, and put into a
capacity of maintaining all his father's house, Israel also came into
Egypt ([Psa 105:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#023).md), where he and all
his were very honourably and comfortably provided for many years. Thus
the New Testament church has a place provided for her even in the
wilderness, where she is nourished for a time, times, and half a time,
[Rev 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#014.md). Verily she shall be fed.

3\. They were wonderfully multiplied, according to the promise made to
Abraham that his seed should be as the sand of the sea for multitude,
[Psa 105:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#024.md). In Egypt he increased his
people greatly; they multiplied like fishes, so that in a little time
they became stronger than their enemies and formidable to them. Pharaoh
took notice of it. [Exo 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#009.md), The
children of Israel are more and mightier than we. When God pleases a
little one shall become a thousand; and God's promises, though they work
slowly, work surely.

[Psalms 105:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 105:25</span></span>

After the history of the patriarchs follows here the history of the
people of Israel, when they grew into a nation.

I. Their affliction in Egypt ([Psa
105:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#025).md): He turned the heart of the
Egyptians, who had protected them, to hate them and deal subtilely with
them. God's goodness to his people exasperated the Egyptians against
them; and, though their old antipathy to the Hebrews (which we read of
[Gen 43:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#032.md); [Gen
46:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#034).md) was laid asleep for a while,
yet now it revived with more violence than ever: formerly they hated
them because they despised them, now because they feared them. They
dealt subtilely with them, set all their politics on work to find out
ways and means to weaken them, and waste them, and prevent their growth;
they made their burdens heavy and their lives bitter, and slew their
male children as soon as they were born. Malice is crafty to destroy:
Satan has the serpent's subtlety, with his venom. It was God that turned
the hearts of the Egyptians against them; for every creature is that to
us that he makes it to be, a friend or an enemy. Though God is not the
author of the sins of men, yet he serves his own purposes by them.

II\. Their deliverance out of Egypt, that work of wonder, which, that it
might never be forgotten, is put into the preface to the ten
commandments. Observe,

1\. The instruments employed in that deliverance ([Psa
105:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#026).md): He sent Moses his servant on
this errand and joined Aaron in commission with him. Moses was designed
to be their lawgiver and chief magistrate, Aaron to be their chief
priest; and therefore, that they might respect them the more and submit
to them the more cheerfully, God made use of them as their deliverers.

2\. The means of accomplishing that deliverance; these were the plagues
of Egypt. Moses and Aaron observed their orders, in summoning them just
as God appointed them, and they rebelled not against his word ([Psa
105:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#028).md) as Jonah did, who, when he was
sent to denounce God's judgments against Nineveh, went to Tarshish.
Moses and Aaron were not moved, either with a foolish fear of Pharaoh's
wrath or a foolish pity of Egypt's misery, to relax or retard any of the
plagues which God ordered them to inflict on the Egyptians, but
stretched forth their hand to inflict them as God appointed. Those that
are instructed to execute judgment will find their remissness construed
as a rebellion against God's word. The plagues of Egypt are here called
God's signs, and his wonders ([Psa
105:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#027).md); they were not only proofs of
his power, but tokens of his wrath, and to be looked upon with
admiration and holy awe. They showed the words of his signs (so it is in
the original), for every plague had an exposition going along with it;
they were not, as the common works of creation and providence, silent
signs, but speaking ones, and they spoke aloud. They are all or most of
them here specified, though not in the order in which they were
inflicted. (1.) The plague of darkness, [Psa
105:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#028.md). This was one of the last,
though here mentioned first. God sent darkness, and, coming with
commission, it came with efficacy; his command made it dark. And then
they (that is, the people of Israel) rebelled not against God's word,
namely, a command which some think was given them to circumcise all
among them that had not been circumcised, in doing which the three days'
darkness would be a protection to them. The old translation follows the
Septuagint, and reads it, They were not obedient to his word, which may
be applied to Pharaoh and the Egyptians, who, notwithstanding the terror
of this plague, would not let the people go; but there is no ground for
it in the Hebrew. (2.) The turning of the river Nilus (which they
idolized) into blood, and all their other waters, which slew their fish
([Psa 105:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#029).md), and so they were
deprived, not only of their drink, but of the daintiest of their meat,
[Num 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#005). (3..md) The frogs, shoals of
which their land brought forth, which poured in upon them, not only in
such numbers, but with such fury, that they could not keep them out of
the chambers of their kings and great men, whose hearts had been full of
vermin, more nauseous and more noxious-contempt of, and enmity to, both
God and his Israel. (4.) Flies of divers sorts swarmed in their air, and
lice in their clothes, [Psa 105:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#031.md);
[Exo 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#017.md), [Exo
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#024.md). Note, God can make use of the
meanest, and weakest, and most despicable animals, for the punishing and
humbling of proud oppressors, to whom the impotency of the instrument
cannot but be a great mortification, as well as an undeniable conviction
of the divine omnipotence. (5.) Hail-stones shattered their trees, even
the strongest timber-trees in their coasts, and killed their vines, and
their other fruit-trees, [Psa 105:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#032.md),
[Psa 105:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#033.md). Instead of rain to
cherish their trees, he gave them hail to crush them, and with it
thunder and lightning, to such a degree that the fire ran along upon the
ground, as if it had been a stream of kindled brimstone, [Exo
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#023). (6..md) Locusts and caterpillars
destroyed all the herbs which were made for the service of man and ate
the bread out of their mouths, [Psa
105:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#034.md), [Psa
105:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#035.md). See what variety of judgments
God has, wherewith to plague proud oppressors, that will not let his
people go. God did not bring the same plague twice, but, when there was
occasion for another, it was still a new one; for he has many arrows in
his quiver. Locusts and caterpillars are God's armies; and, how weak
soever they are singly, he can raise such numbers of them as to make
them formidable, [Joe 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#004.md), [Joe
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#006). (7..md) Having mentioned all the
plagues but those of the murrain and boils, he concludes with that which
gave the conquering stroke, and that was the death of the first-born,
[Psa 105:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#036.md). In the dead of the night
the joys and hopes of their families, the chief of their strength and
flower of their land, were all struck dead by the destroying angel. They
would not release God's first-born, and therefore God seized theirs by
way of reprisal, and thereby forced them to dismiss his too, when it was
too late to retrieve their own; for when God judges he will overcome,
and those will certainly sit down losers at last that contend with him.

3\. The mercies that accompanied this deliverance. In their bondage,
(1.) They had been impoverished, and yet they came out rich and wealthy.
God not only brought them forth, but he brought them forth with silver
and gold, [Psa 105:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#037.md). God empowered
them to ask and collect the contributions of their neighbours (which
were indeed but part of payment for the service they had done them) and
inclined the Egyptians to furnish them with what they asked. Their
wealth was his, and therefore he might, their hearts were in his hand,
and therefore he could, give it to the Israelites. (2.) Their lives had
been made bitter to them, and their bodies and spirits broken by their
bondage; and yet, when God brought them forth, there was not one feeble
person, none sick, none so much as sickly, among their tribes. They went
out that very night that the plague swept away all the first-born of
Egypt, and yet they went out all in good health, and brought not with
them any of the diseases of Egypt. Surely never was the like, that among
so many thousands there was not one sick! So false was the
representation which the enemies of the Jews, in after-ages, gave of
this matter, that they were all sick of a leprosy, or some loathsome
disease, and that therefore the Egyptians thrust them out of their land.
(3.) They had been trampled upon and insulted over; and yet they were
brought out with honour ([Psa 105:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#038).md):
Egypt was glad when they departed; for God had so wonderfully owned
them, and pleaded their cause, that the fear of Israel fell upon them,
and they owned themselves baffled and overcome. God can and will make
his church a burdensome stone to all that heave at it and seek to
displace it, so that those shall think themselves happy that get out of
its way, [Zac 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#003.md). When God judges,
he will overcome. (4.) They had spent their days in sorrow and in
sighing, by reason of their bondage; but now he brought them forth with
joy and gladness, [Psa 105:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#043.md). When
Egypt's cry for grief was loud, their first-born being all slain,
Israel's shouts for joy were as loud, both when they looked back upon
the land of slavery out of which they were rescued and when they looked
forward to the pleasant land to which they were hastening. God now put a
new song into their mouth.

4\. The special care God took of them in the wilderness. (1.) For their
shelter. Besides the canopy of heaven, he provided them another heavenly
canopy: He spread a cloud for a covering ([Psa
105:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#039).md), which was to them not only a
screen and umbrella, but a cloth of state. A cloud was often God's
pavilion ([Psa 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011).md) and now it was
Israel's; for they also were his hidden ones. (2.) For their guidance
and refreshment in the dark. He appointed a pillar of fire to give light
in the night, that they might never be at a loss. Note, God graciously
provides against all the grievances of his people, and furnishes them
with convenient succours for every condition, for day and night, till
they come to heaven, where it will be all day to eternity. (3.) He fed
them both with necessaries and dainties. Sometimes he furnished their
tables with wild fowl ([Psa 105:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#040).md):
The people asked, and he brought quails; and, when they were not thus
feasted, yet they were abundantly satisfied with the bread of heaven.
Those are curious and covetous indeed who will not be so satisfied. Man
did eat angels' food, and that constantly and on free-cost. And, as
every bit they ate had miracle in it, so had every drop they drank: He
opened the rock, and the waters gushed out, [Psa
105:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#041.md). Common providence fetches
waters from heaven, and bread out of the earth; but for Israel the
divine power brings bread from the clouds and water from the rocks: so
far is the God of nature from being tied to the laws and courses of
nature. The water did not only gush out once, but it ran like a river,
plentifully and constantly, and attended their camp in all their
removes; hence they are said to have the rock follow them ([Co1
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004).md), and, which increased the
miracle, this river of God (so it might be truly called) ran in dry
places, and yet was not drunk in and lost, as one would have expected it
to be, by the sands of the desert of Arabia. To this that promise
alludes, I will give rivers in the desert, to give drink to my chosen,
[Isa 43:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#019.md), [Isa
43:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#020.md).

5\. Their entrance, at length, into Canaan ([Psa
105:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#044).md): He gave them the lands of the
heathen, put them in possession of that which they had long been put in
hopes of; and what the Canaanites had taken pains for God's Israel had
the enjoyment of: They inherited the labour of the people; and the
wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just. The Egyptians had long
inherited their labours, and now they inherited the labours of the
Canaanites. Thus sometimes one enemy of the church is made to pay
another's scores.

6\. The reasons why God did all this for them. (1.) Because he would
himself perform the promises of the word, [Psa
105:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#042.md). They were unworthy and
unthankful, yet he did those great things in their favour because he
remembered the word of his holiness (that is, his covenant) with Abraham
his servant, and he would not suffer one iota or tittle of that to fall
to the ground. See [Deu 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#008). (2..md)
Because he would have them to perform the precepts of the word, to bind
them to which was the greatest kindness he could put upon them. He put
them in possession of Canaan, not that they might live in plenty and
pleasure, in ease and honour, and might make a figure among the nations,
but that they might observe his statutes and keep his laws, - that,
being formed into a people, they might be under God's immediate
government, and revealed religion might be the basis of their national
constitution, - that, having a good land given them, they might out of
the profits of it bring sacrifices to God's altar, - and that, God
having thus done them good, they might the more cheerfully receive his
law, concluding that also designed for their good, and might be sensible
of their obligations in gratitude to live in obedience to him. We are
therefore made, maintained, and redeemed, that we may live in obedience
to the will of God; and the hallelujah with which the psalm concludes
may be taken both as a thankful acknowledgment of God's favours and as a
cheerful concurrence with this great intention of them. Has God done so
much for us, and yet does he expect so little from us? Praise you the
Lord.
