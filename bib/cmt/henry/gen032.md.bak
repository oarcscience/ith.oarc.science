### [Genesis Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 32:0</span></span>

We have here Jacob still upon his journey towards Canaan. Never did so
many memorable things occur in any march as in this of Jacob's little
family. By the way he meets, I. With good tidings from his God ([Gen
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#001.md), [Gen
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#002).md). II. With bad tidings from his
brother, to whom he sent a message to notify his return ([Gen
32:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#003).md). In his distress, 1. He
divides his company ([Gen 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#007.md), [Gen
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#008).md). 2. He makes his prayer to God
([Gen 32:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#009).md). 3. He sends a present
to his brother ([Gen 32:13-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#013).md). 4. He
wrestles with the angel ([Gen
32:24-32](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024).md).

[Genesis 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 32:1</span></span>

Jacob, having got clear of Laban, pursues his journey homewards towards
Canaan: when God has helped us through difficulties we should go on our
way heaven-ward with so much the more cheerfulness and resolution. Now,
1. Here is Jacob's convoy in his journey ([Gen
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#001).md): The angels of God met him, in a
visible appearance, whether in a vision by da or in a dream by night, as
when he saw them upon the ladder ([Gen
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#012).md), is uncertain. Note, Those that
keep in a good way have always a good guard; angels themselves are
ministering spirits for their safety, [Heb
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#014.md). Where Jacob pitched his tents,
they pitched theirs about him, [Psa
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007.md). They met him, to bid him welcome
to Canaan again; a more honourable reception this was than ever any
prince had, that was met by the magistrates of a city in their
formalities. They met him to congratulate him on his arrival, as well as
on his escape from Laban; for they have pleasure in the prosperity of
God's servants. They had invisibly attended him all along, but now they
appeared to him, because he had greater dangers before him than those he
had hitherto encountered. Note, When God designs his people for
extraordinary trials, he prepares them by extraordinary comforts. We
should think it had been more seasonable for these angels to have
appeared to him amidst the perplexity and agitation occasioned first by
Laban, and afterwards by Esau, than in this calm and quiet interval,
when he saw not himself in any imminent peril; but God will have us,
when we are in peace, to provide for trouble, and, when trouble comes,
to live upon former observations and experiences; for we walk by faith,
not by sight. God's people, at death, are returning to Canaan, to their
Father's house; and then the angels of God will meet them, to
congratulate them on the happy finishing of their servitude, and to
carry them to their rest. 2. The comfortable notice he took of this
convoy, [Gen 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#002.md). This is God's host,
and therefore, (1.) It is a powerful host; very great is he that is thus
attended, and very safe that is thus guarded. (2.) God must have the
praise of this protection: "This I may thank God for, for it is his
host." A good man may with an eye of faith see the same that Jacob saw
with his bodily eyes, by believing that promise ([Psa
91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011).md), He shall give his angels
charge over thee. What need have we to dispute whether every particular
saint has a guardian angel, when we are sure he has a guard of angels
about him? To preserve the remembrance of this favour, Jacob gave a name
to the place from it, Mahanaim, two hosts, or two camps. That is, say
some of the rabbin, one host of the guardian angels of Mesopotamia, who
conducted Jacob thence, and delivered him safely to the other host of
the angels of Canaan, who met him upon the borders where he now was.
Rather, they appeared to him in two hosts, one on either side, or one in
the front and the other in the rear, to protect him from Laban behind
and Esau before, that they might be a complete guard. Thus he is
compassed with God's favour. Perhaps in allusion to this the church is
called Mahanaim, two armies, [Sol
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#013.md). Here were Jacob's family, which
made one army, representing the church militant and itinerant on earth;
and the angels, another army, representing the church triumphant and at
rest in heaven.

[Genesis 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 32:3</span></span>

Now that Jacob was re-entering Canaan God, by the vision of angels,
reminded him of the friends he had when he left it, and thence he takes
occasion to remind himself of the enemies he had, particularly Esau. It
is probable that Rebekah had sent him word of Esau's settlement in Seir,
and of the continuance of his enmity to him. What shall poor Jacob do?
He longs to see his father, and yet he dreads to see his brother. He
rejoices to see Canaan again, and yet cannot but rejoice with trembling
because of Esau.

I. He sends a very kind and humble message to Esau. It does not appear
that his way lay through Esau's country, or that he needed to ask his
leave for a passage; but his way lay near it, and he would not go by him
without paying him the respect due to a brother, a twin-brother, an only
brother, an elder brother, a brother offended. Note, 1. Though our
relations fail in their duty to us, yet we must make conscience of doing
our duty to them. 2. It is a piece of friendship and brotherly love to
acquaint our friends with our condition, and enquire into theirs. Acts
of civility may help to slay enmities. Jacob's message to him is very
obliging, v. 4, 5. (1.) He calls Esau his lord, himself his servant, to
intimate that he did not insist upon the prerogatives of the birthright
and blessing he had obtained for himself, but left it to God to fulfil
his own purpose in his seed. Note, Yielding pacifies great offences,
[Ecc 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#004.md). We must not refuse to speak
in a respectful an submissive manner to those that are ever so unjustly
exasperated against it (2.) He gives him a short account of himself,
that he was not a fugitive and a vagabond, but, though long absent, had
had a certain dwelling-place, with his own relations: I have sojourned
with Laban, and staid there till now; and that he was not a beggar, nor
did he come home, as the prodigal son, destitute of necessaries and
likely to be a charge to his relations; no, I have oxen and asses. This
he knew would (if any thing) recommend him to Esau's good opinion. And,
(3.) He courts his favour: I have sent, that I might find grace in thy
sight. Note, It is no disparagement to those that have the better cause
to become petitioners for reconciliation, and to sue for peace as well
as right.

II\. He receives a very formidable account of Esau's warlike
preparations against him ([Gen 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#006).md),
not a word, but a blow, a very coarse return to his kind message, and a
sorry welcome home to a poor brother: He comes to meet thee, and four
hundred men with him. He is now weary of waiting for the days of
mourning for this good father, and even before they come he resolves to
slay his brother. 1. He remembers the old quarrel, and will now be
avenged on him for the birthright and blessing, and, if possible, defeat
Jacob's expectations from both. Note, malice harboured will last long,
and find an occasion to break out with violence a great while after the
provocations given. Angry men have good memories. 2. He envies Jacob
what little estate he had, and, though he himself was now possessed of a
much better, yet nothing will serve him but to feed his eyes upon
Jacob's ruin, and fill his fields with Jacob's spoils. Perhaps the
account Jacob sent him of his wealth did but provoke him the more. 3. He
concludes it easy to destroy him, now that he was upon the road, a poor
weary traveller, unfixed, and (as he thinks) unguarded. Those that have
the serpent's poison have commonly the serpent's policy, to take the
first and fairest opportunity that offers itself for revenge. 4. He
resolves to do it suddenly, and before Jacob had come to his father,
lest he should interpose and mediate between them. Esau was one of those
that hated peace; when Jacob speaks, speaks peaceably, he is for war,
[Psa 120:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#006.md), [Psa
120:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#007.md). Out he marches, spurred on with
rage, and intent on blood and murders; four hundred men he had with him,
probably such as used to hunt with him, armed, no doubt, rough and cruel
like their leader, ready to execute the word of command though ever so
barbarous, and now breathing nothing but threatenings and slaughter. The
tenth part of these were enough to cut off poor Jacob, and his guiltless
helpless family, root and branch. No marvel therefore that it follows
([Gen 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#007).md), then Jacob was greatly
afraid and distressed, perhaps the more so from having scarcely
recovered the fright Laban had put him in. Note, Many are the troubles
of the righteous in this world, and sometimes the end of one is but the
beginning of another. The clouds return after the rain. Jacob, though a
man of great faith, yet was now greatly afraid. Note, A lively
apprehension of danger, and a quickening fear arising from it, may very
well consist with a humble confidence in God's power and promise. Christ
himself, in his agony, was sorely amazed.

III\. He puts himself into the best posture of defence that his present
circumstances will admit. It was absurd to think of making resistance,
all his contrivance is to make an escape, [Gen
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#007.md), [Gen
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#008.md). He thinks it prudent not to
venture all in one bottom, and therefore divides what he had into two
companies, that, if one were smitten, the other might escape. Like a
tender careful master of a family, he is more solicitous for their
safety than for his own. He divided his company, not as Abraham ([Gen
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#015).md), for fight, but for flight.

[Genesis 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 32:9</span></span>

Our rule is to call upon God in the time of trouble; we have here an
example to this rule, and the success encourages us to follow this
example. It was now a time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be saved out
of it; and here we have him praying for that salvation, [Jer
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#007.md). In his distress he sought the
Lord, and he heard him. Note, Times of fear should be times of prayer;
whatever frightens us should drive us to our knees, to our God. Jacob
had lately seen his guard of angels, but, in this distress, he applied
to God, not to them; he knew they were his fellow-servants, [Rev
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#009.md). Nor did he consult Laban's
teraphim; it was enough for him that he had a God to go to. To him he
addresses himself with all possible solemnity, so running for safety
into the name of the Lord, as a strong tower, [Pro
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010.md). This prayer is the more
remarkable because it won him the honour of being an Israel, a prince
with God, and the father of the praying remnant, who are hence called
the seed of Jacob, to whom he never said, Seek you me in vain. Now it is
worth while to enquire what there was extraordinary in this prayer, that
it should gain the petitioner all this honour.

I. The request itself is one, and very express: Deliver me from the hand
of my brother, [Gen 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#011.md). Though
there was no human probability on his side, yet he believed the power of
God could rescue him as a lamb out of the bloody jaws of the loin. Note,
1. We have leave to be particular in our addresses to God, to mention
the particular straits and difficulties we are in; for the God with whom
we have to do is one we may be free with: we have liberty of speech
(parresia) at the throne of grace. 2. When our brethren aim to be our
destroyers, it is our comfort that we have a Father to whom we may apply
as our deliverer.

II\. The pleas are many, and very powerful; never was cause better
ordered, [Job 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#004.md). He offers up his
request with great faith, fervency, and humility. How earnestly does he
beg! Deliver me, I pray thee, [Gen
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#011.md). His fear made him importunate.
With what holy logic does he argue! With what divine eloquence does he
plead! Here is a noble copy to write after.

1\. He addresses himself to God as the God of his fathers, [Gen
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#009.md). Such was the humble self-denying
sense he had of his own unworthiness that he did not call God his own
God, but a God in covenant with his ancestors: O God of my father
Abraham, and God of my father Isaac; and this he could the better plead
because the covenant, by divine designation, was entailed upon him.
Note, God's covenant with our fathers may be a comfort to us when were
are in distress. It has often been so to the Lord's people, [Psa
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#004.md), [Psa
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#005.md). Being born in God's house, we
are taken under his special protection.

2\. He produces his warrant: Thou saidst unto me, Return unto thy
country. He did not rashly leave his place with Laban, nor undertake
this journey out of a fickle humour, or a foolish fondness for his
native country, but in obedience to God's command. Note, (1.) We may be
in the way of our duty, and yet may meet with trouble and distress in
that way. As prosperity will not prove us in the right, so cross events
will not prove us in the wrong; we may be going whither God calls us,
and yet may think our way hedged up with thorns. (2.) We may comfortably
trust God with our safety, while we carefully keep to our duty. If God
be our guide, he will be our guard.

3\. He humbly acknowledges his own unworthiness to receive any favour
from God ([Gen 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#010).md): I am not
worthy; it is an unusual plea. Some would think he should have pleaded
that what was now in danger was his own, against all the world, and that
he had earned it dear enough; no, he pleads, Lord, I am not worthy of
it. Note, Self-denial and self-abasement well become us in all our
addresses to the throne of grace. Christ never commended any of his
petitioners so much as him who said, Lord, I am not worthy ([Mat
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#008).md), and her who said, Truth, Lord,
yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table,
[Mat 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#027). Now observe here, (1..md) How
magnificently and honourably he speaks of the mercies of God to him. We
have here, mercies, in the plural number, and inexhaustible spring, and
innumerable streams; mercies and truth, that is, past mercies given
according to the promise, and further mercies secured by the promise.
Note, What is laid up in God's truth, as well as what is laid out in
God's mercies, is the matter both of the comforts and the praises of
active believers. Nay, observe, it is all the mercies, and all the
truth; the manner of expression is copious, and intimates that his heart
was full of God's goodness. (2.) How meanly and humbly he speaks of
himself, disclaiming all thought of his own merit: "I am not worthy of
the least of all thy mercies, much less am I worthy of so great a favour
as this I am now suing for." Jacob was a considerable man, and, upon
many accounts, very deserving, and, in treating with Laban, had justly
insisted on his merits, but not before God. I am less than all thy
mercies; so the word is. Note, The best and greatest of men are utterly
unworthy of the least favour from God, and just be ready to own it upon
all occasions. It was the excellent Mr. Herbert's motto, Less than the
least of all God's mercies. Those are best prepared for the greatest
mercies that see themselves unworthy of the least.

4\. He thankfully owns God's goodness to him in his banishment, and how
much it had outdone his expectations: "With my staff I passed over this
Jordan, poor and desolate, like a forlorn and despised pilgrim;" he had
no guides, no companions, no attendants, no conveniences for travel, but
his staff only, nothing else to stay himself upon; "and now I have
become two bands, now I am surrounded with a numerous and comfortable
retinue of children and servants:" though it was his distress that had
now obliged him to divide his family into two bands, yet he makes use of
that for the magnifying of the mercy of his increase. Note, (1.) The
increase of our families is then comfortable indeed to us when we see
God's mercies, and his truth, in it. (2.) Those whose latter end greatly
increases ought, with humility and thankfulness, to remember how small
their beginning was. Jacob pleads, "Lord, thou didst keep me when I went
out with only my staff, and had but one life to lose; wilt thou not keep
me now that so many are embarked with me?"

5\. He urges the extremity of the peril he was in: Lord, deliver me from
Esau, for I fear him, [Gen 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#011.md). The
people of God have not been shy of telling God their fears; for they
know he takes cognizance of them, and considers them. The fear that
quickens prayer is itself pleadable. It was not a robber, but a
murderer, that he was afraid of; nor was it his own life only that lay
at stake, but the mothers' and the children's, that had left their
native soil to go along with him. Note, Natural affection may furnish us
with allowable acceptable pleas in prayer.

6\. He insists especially upon the promise God had made him ([Gen
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#009).md): Thou saidst, I will deal well
with thee, and again, in the close ([Gen
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#012).md): Thou saidst, I will surely do
thee good. Note, (1.) The best we can say to God in prayer is what he
has said to us. God's promises, as they are the surest guide of our
desires in prayer, and furnish us with the best petitions, so they are
the firmest ground of our hopes, and furnish us with the best pleas.
"Lord, thou saidst thus and thus; and wilt thou not be as good as thy
word, the word upon which thou had caused me to hope?" [Psa
119:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#049). (2..md) The most general promises
are applicable to particular cases. "Thou saidst, I will do thee good;
Lord, do me good in this matter." He pleads also a particular promise,
that of the multiplying of hes seed. "Lord, what will become of that
promise, if they be all cut off?" Note, \[1.\] There are promises to the
families of good people, which are improvable in prayer for
family-mercies, ordinary and extraordinary, [Gen
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007.md); [Psa
112:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#002.md); [Psa
102:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#028.md). \[2.\] The world's
threatenings should drive us to God's promises.

[Genesis 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 32:13</span></span>

Jacob, having piously made God his friend by a prayer, is here prudently
endeavouring to make Esau his friend by a present. He had prayed to God
to deliver him from the had of Esau, for he feared him; but neither did
his fear sink into such a despair as dispirits for the use of means, nor
did his prayer make him presume upon God's mercy, without the use of
means. Note, When we have prayed to God for any mercy, we must second
our prayers with our endeavours; else, instead of trusting god, we tempt
him; we must so depend upon God's providence as to make use of our own
prudence. "Help thyself, and God will help thee;" God answers our
prayers by teaching us to order our affairs with discretion. To pacify
Esau,

I. Jacob sent him a very noble present, not of jewels or fine garments
(he had them not), but of cattle, to the number of 580 in all, [Gen
32:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#013.md). Now, 1. It was an evidence
of the great increase with which God had blessed Jacob that he could
spare such a number of cattle out of his stock. 2. It was an evidence of
his wisdom that he would willingly part with some, to secure the rest;
some men's covetousness loses them more than ever it gained them, and,
by grudging a little damage; skin for skin, and all that a man has, if
he be a wise man, he will give for his life. 3. It was a present that he
thought would be acceptable to Esau, who had traded so much in hunting
wild beasts that perhaps he was but ill furnished with tame cattle with
which to stock his new conquests. And we may suppose that the mixed
colours of Jacob's cattle, ring-straked, speckled, and spotted, would
please Esau's fancy. 4. He promised himself that by this present he
should gain Esau's favour; for a gift commonly prospers, which way
soever it turns ([Pro 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#008).md), and makes
room for a man ([Pro 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#016).md); nay, it
pacifies anger and strong wrath, [Pro
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#014.md). Note, \[1.\] We must not
despair of reconciling ourselves even to those that have been most
exasperated against us; we ought not to judge men unappeasable, till we
have tried to appease them. \[2.\] Peace and love, though purchased
dearly, will prove a good bargain to the purchaser. Many a morose
ill-natured man would have said, in Jacob's case, "Esau has vowed my
death without cause, and he shall never be a farthing the better for me;
I will see him far enough before I will send him a present:" but Jacob
forgives and forgets.

II\. He sent him a very humble message, which he ordered his servants to
deliver in the best manner, [Gen
32:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#017.md), [Gen
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#018.md). They must call Esau their lord,
and Jacob his servant; they must tell him the cattle they had was a
small present which Jacob had sent him, as a specimen of his
acquisitions while he was abroad. The cattle he sent were to be disposed
of in several droves, and the servants that attended each drove were to
deliver the same message, that the present might appear the more
valuable, and his submission, so often repeated, might be the more
likely to influence Esau. They must especially take care to tell him
that Jacob was coming after ([Gen
32:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#018).md), that he might not suspect
he had fled through fear. Note, A friendly confidence in men's goodness
may help to prevent the mischief designed us by their badness: if Jacob
will seem not to be afraid of Esau, Esau, it may be hoped, will not be a
terror to Jacob.

[Genesis 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 32:24</span></span>

We have here the remarkable story of Jacob's wrestling with the angel
and prevailing, which is referred to, [Hos
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004.md). Very early in the morning, a
great while before day, Jacob had helped his wives and his children over
the river, and he desired to be private, and was left alone, that he
might again more fully spread his cares and fears before God in prayer.
Note, We ought to continue instant in prayer, always to pray and not to
faint: frequency and importunity in prayer prepare us for mercy. While
Jacob was earnest in prayer, stirring up himself to take hold on God, an
angel takes hold on him. Some think this was a created angel, the angel
of his presence ([Isa 63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009).md), one of
those that always behold the face of our Father and attend on the
shechinah, or the divine Majesty, which probably Jacob had also in view.
Others think it was Michael our prince, the eternal Word, the angel of
the covenant, who is indeed the Lord of the angels, who often appeared
in a human shape before he assumed the human nature for a perpetuity;
whichsoever it was, we are sure God's name was in him, [Exo
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#021.md). Observe,

I. How Jacob and this angel engaged, [Gen
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024.md). It was a single combat, hand to
hand; they had neither of them any seconds. Jacob was now full of care
and fear about the interview he expected, next day, with his brother,
and, to aggravate the trial, God himself seemed to come forth against
him as an enemy, to oppose his entrance into the land of promise, and to
dispute the pass with him, not suffering him to follow his wives and
children whom he had sent before. Note, Strong believers must expect
divers temptations, and strong ones. We are told by the prophet ([Hos
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004).md) how Jacob wrestled: he wept, and
made supplication; prayers and tears were his weapons. It was not only a
corporal, but a spiritual, wrestling, by the vigorous actings of faith
and holy desire; and thus all the spiritual seed of Jacob, that pray in
praying, still wrestle with God.

II\. What was the success of the engagement. 1. Jacob kept his ground;
though the struggle continued long, the angel, prevailed not against him
([Gen 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#025).md), that is, this
discouragement did not shake his faith, nor silence his prayer. It was
not in his own strength that he wrestled, nor by his own strength that
he prevailed, but in and by strength derived from Heaven. That of Job
illustrates this ([Job 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006).md), Will he
plead against me with his great power? No (had the angel done so, Jacob
had been crushed), but he will put strength in me; and by that strength
Jacob had power over the angel, [Hos
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004.md). Note, We cannot prevail with God
but in his own strength. It is his Spirit that intercedes in us, and
helps our infirmities, [Rom 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026.md). 2.
The angel put out Jacob's thigh, to show him what he could do, and that
it was God he was wrestling with, for no man could disjoint his thigh
with a touch. Some think that Jacob felt little or no pain from this
hurt; it is probable that he did not, for he did not so much as halt
till the struggle was over ([Gen
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#031).md), and, if so, this was an
evidence of a divine touch indeed, which wounded and healed at the same
time. Jacob prevailed, and yet had his thigh put out. Note, Wrestling
believers may obtain glorious victories, and yet come off with broken
bones; for when they are weak then are they strong, weak in themselves,
but strong in Christ, [Co2 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#010.md). Our
honours and comforts in this world have their alloys. 3. The angel, by
an admirable condescension, mildly requests Jacob to let him go ([Gen
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#026).md), as God said to Moses ([Exo
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#010).md), Let me alone. Could not a
mighty angel get clear of Jacob's grapples? He could; but thus he would
put an honour on Jacob's faith and prayer, and further try his
constancy. The king is held in the galleries ([Sol
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#005)); I held him (says the spouse.md) and
would not let him go, [Sol 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#004.md). The
reason the angel gives why he would be gone is because the day breaks,
and therefore he would not any longer detain Jacob, who had business to
do, a journey to go, a family to look after, which, especially in this
critical juncture, called for his attendance. Note, Every thing is
beautiful in its season; even the business of religion, and the comforts
of communion with God, must sometimes give way to the necessary affairs
of this life: God will have mercy, and not sacrifice. 4. Jacob persists
in his holy importunity: I will not let thee go, except thou bless me;
whatever becomes of his family and journey, he resolves to make the best
he can of this opportunity, and not to lose the advantage of his
victory: he does not mean to wrestle all night for nothing, but humbly
resolves he will have a blessing, and rather shall all his bones be put
out of joint than he will go away without one. The credit of a conquest
will do him no good without the comfort of a blessing. In begging this
blessing he owns his inferiority, though he seemed to have the upper
hand in the struggle; for the less is blessed of the better. Note, Those
that would have the blessing of Christ must be in good earnest, and be
importunate for it, as those that resolve to have no denial. It is the
fervent prayer that is the effectual prayer. 5. The angel puts a
perpetual mark of honour upon him, by changing his name ([Gen
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#027.md), [Gen
32:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#028).md): "Thou art a brave combatant"
(says the angel), "a man of heroic resolution; what is thy name?"
"Jacob," says he, a supplanter; so Jacob signifies: "Well," says the
angel, "be thou never so called any more; henceforth thou shalt be
celebrated, not for craft and artful management, but for true valour;
thou shalt be called Israel, a prince with God, a name greater than
those of the great men of the earth." He is a prince indeed that is a
prince with God, and those are truly honourable that are mighty in
prayer, Israels, Israelites indeed. Jacob is here knighted in the field,
as it were, and has a title of honour given him by him that is the
fountain of honour, which will remain, to his praise, to the end of
time. Yet this was not all; having power with God, he shall have power
with men too. Having prevailed for a blessing from heaven, he shall, no
doubt, prevail for Esau's favour. Note, Whatever enemies we have, if we
can but make God our friend, we are well off; those that by faith have
power on earth as they have occasion for. 6. He dismisses him with a
blessing, [Gen 32:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#029.md). Jacob desired to
know the angel's name, that he might, according to his capacity, do him
honour, [Jdg 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#017.md). But that request
was denied, that he might not be too proud of his conquest, nor think he
had the angel at such an advantage as to oblige him to what he pleased.
No, "Wherefore dost thou ask after my name? What good will it do thee to
know that?" The discovery of that was reserved for his death-bed, upon
which he was taught to call him Shiloh. But, instead of telling him his
name, he gave him his blessing, which was the thing he wrestled for: He
blessed him there, repeated and ratified the blessing formerly given
him. Note, Spiritual blessings, which secure our felicity, are better
and much more desirable than fine notions which satisfy our curiosity.
An interest in the angel's blessing is better than an acquaintance with
his name. The tree of life is better than the tree of knowledge. Thus
Jacob carried his point; a blessing he wrestled for, and a blessing he
had; nor did ever any of his praying seed seek in vain. See how
wonderfully God condescends to countenance and crown importunate prayer:
those that resolve, though God slay them, yet to trust in him, will, at
length, be more than conquerors. 7. Jacob gives a new name to the place;
he calls it Peniel, the face of God ([Gen
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#030).md), because there he had seen the
appearance of God, and obtained the favour of God. Observe, The name he
gives to the place preserves and perpetuates, not the honour of his
valour or victory, but only the honour of God's free grace. He does not
say, "In this place I wrestled with God, and prevailed;" but, "In this
place I saw God face to face, and my life was preserved;" not, "It was
my praise that I came off a conqueror, but it was God's mercy that I
escaped with my life." Note, It becomes those whom God honours to take
shame to themselves, and to admire the condescensions of his grace to
them. Thus David did, after God had sent him a gracious message ([Sa2
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#018).md), Who am I, O Lord God? 8. The
memorandum Jacob carried of this in his bones: He halted on his thigh
([Gen 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#031).md); some think he continued
to do so to his dying-day; and, if he did, he had no reason to complain,
for the honour and comfort he obtained by this struggle were abundantly
sufficient to countervail the damage, though he went limping to his
grave. He had no reason to look upon it as his reproach thus to bear in
his body the marks of the Lord Jesus ([Gal
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017).md); yet it might serve, like Paul's
thorn in the flesh, to keep him from being lifted up with the abundance
of the revelations. Notice is taken of the sun's rising upon him when he
passed over Penuel; for it is sunrise with that soul that has communion
with God. The inspired penman mentions a traditional custom which the
seed of Jacob had, in remembrance of this, never to eat of that sinew,
or muscle, in any beast, by which the hip-bone is fixed in its cup: thus
they preserved the memorial of this story, and gave occasion to their
children to enquire concerning it; they also did honour to the memory of
Jacob. And this use we may still make of it, to acknowledge the mercy of
God, and our obligations to Jesus Christ, that we may now keep up our
communion with God, in faith, hope, and love, without peril either of
life or limb.
