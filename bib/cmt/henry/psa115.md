### [Psalms Chapter 115](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 115:0</span></span>

Many ancient translations join this psalm to that which goes next before
it, the Septuagint particularly, and the vulgar Latin; but it is, in the
Hebrew, a distinct psalm. In it we are taught to give glory, I. To God,
and not to ourselves ([Psa 115:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#001).md). II.
To God, and not to idols ([Psa
115:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#002).md). We must give glory to God,
1. By trusting in him, and in his promise and blessing ([Psa
115:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#009).md). 2. By blessing him ([Psa
115:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#016).md). Some think this psalm was
penned upon occasion of some great distress and trouble that the church
of God was in, when the enemies were in insolent and threatening, in
which case the church does not so much pour out her complaint to God as
place her confidence in God, and triumph in doing so; and with such a
holy triumph we ought to sing this psalm.

[Psalms 115:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 115:1</span></span>

Sufficient care is here taken to answer both the pretensions of self and
the reproaches of idolaters.

I. Boasting is here for ever excluded, [Psa
115:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#001.md). Let no opinion of our own
merits have any room either in our prayers or in our praises, but let
both centre in God's glory. 1. Have we received any mercy, gone through
any service, or gained any success? We must not assume the glory of it
to ourselves, but ascribe it wholly to God. We must not imagine that we
do any thing for God by our own strength, or deserve any thing from God
by our own righteousness; but all the good we do is done by the power of
his grace, and all the good we have is the gift of his mere mercy, and
therefore he must have all the praise. Say not, The power of my hand has
gotten me this wealth, [Deu 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#017.md). Say
not, For my righteousness the Lord has done these great and kind things
for me, [Deu 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#004.md). No; all our songs
must be sung to this humble tune, Not unto us, O Lord! and again, Not
unto us, but to thy name, let all the glory be given; for whatever good
is wrought in us, or wrought for us, it is for his mercy and his truth's
sake, because he will glorify his mercy and fulfil his promise. All our
crowns must be cast at the feet of him that sits upon the throne, for
that is the proper place for them. 2. Are we in pursuit of any mercy and
wrestling with God for it? We must take our encouragement, in prayer,
from God only, and have an eye to his glory more than to our own benefit
in it. "Lord, do so and so for us, not that we may have the credit and
comfort of it, but that thy mercy and truth may have the glory of it."
This must be our highest and ultimate end in our prayers, and therefore
it is made the first petition in the Lord's prayer, as that which guides
all the rest, Hallowed be thy name; and, in order to that, Give us our
daily bread, etc. This also must satisfy us, if our prayers be not
answered in the letter of them. Whatever becomes of us, unto thy name
give glory. See [Joh 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#027.md), [Joh
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#028.md).

II\. The reproach of the heathen is here for ever silenced and justly
retorted.

1\. The psalmist complains of the reproach of the heathen ([Psa
115:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#002).md): Wherefore should they say,
Where is now their God? (1.) "Why do they say so? Do they not know that
our God is every where by his providence, and always nigh to us by his
promise and grace?" (2.) "Why does God permit them to say so? Nay, why
is Israel brought so low that they have some colour for saying so? Lord,
appear for our relief, that thou mayest vindicate thyself, and glorify
thy own name."

2\. He gives a direct answer to their question, [Psa
115:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003.md). "Do they ask where is our God?
We can tell where he is." (1.) "In the upper world is the presence of
his glory: Our God is in the heavens, where the gods of the heathen
never were, in the heavens, and therefore out of sight; but, though his
majesty be unapproachable, it does not therefore follow that his being
is questionable." (2.) "In the lower world are the products of his
power: He has done whatsoever he pleased, according to the counsel of
his will; he has a sovereign dominion and a universal uncontrollable
influence. Do you ask where he is? He is at the beginning and end of
every thing, and not far from any of us."

3\. He returns their question upon themselves. They asked, Where is the
God of Israel? because he is not seen. He does in effect ask, What are
the gods of the heathen? because they are seen. (1.) He shows that their
gods, though they are not shapeless things, are senseless things.
Idolaters, at first, worshipped the sun and moon ([Job
31:26](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026).md), which was bad enough, but not
so bad as that which they were now come to (for evil men grow worse and
worse), which was the worshipping of images, [Psa
115:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#004.md). The matter of them was silver
and gold, dug out of the earth (man found them poor and dirty in a mine,
Herbert), proper things to make money of, but not to make gods of. The
make of them was from the artificer; they are creatures of men's vain
imaginations and the works of men's hands, and therefore can have no
divinity in them. If man is the work of God's hands (as certainly he is,
and it was his honour that he was made in the image of God) it is absurd
to think that that can be God which is the work of men's hands, or that
it can be any other than a dishonour to God to make him in the image of
man. The argument is irrefragable: The workmen made it, therefore it is
not God, [Hos 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#006.md). These idols are
represented here as the most ridiculous things, a mere jest, that would
seem to be something, but were really nothing, fitter for a toy shop
than a temple, for children to play with than for men to pray to. The
painter, the carver, the statuary, did their part well enough; they made
them with mouths and eyes, ears and noses, hands and feet, but they
could put no life into them and therefore no sense. They had better have
worshipped a dead carcase (for that had life in it once) than a dead
image, which neither has life nor can have. They speak not, in answer to
those that consult them; the crafty priest must speak for them. In
Baal's image there was no voice, neither any that answered. They see not
the prostrations of their worshippers before them, much less their
burdens and wants. They hear not their prayers, though ever so loud;
they smell not their incense, though ever so strong, ever so sweet; they
handle not the gifts presented to them, much less have they any gifts to
bestow on their worshippers; they cannot stretch forth their hands to
the needy. They walk not, they cannot stir a step for the relief of
those that apply to them. Nay, they do not so much as breathe through
their throat; they have not the least sign of symptom of life, but are
as dead, after the priest has pretended to consecrate them and call a
deity into them, as they were before. (2.) He thence infers the
sottishness of their worshippers ([Psa
115:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#008).md): Those that make them images
show their ingenuity, and doubtless are sensible men; but those that
make them gods show their stupidity and folly, and are like unto them,
as senseless blockish things; they see not the invisible things of the
true and living God in the works of creation; they hear not the voice of
the day and the night, which in every speech and language declare his
glory, [Psa 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#002.md), [Psa
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#003.md). By worshipping these foolish
puppets, they make themselves more and more foolish like them, and set
themselves at a greater distance from every thing that is spiritual,
sinking themselves deeper into the mire of sense; and withal they
provoke God to give them up to a reprobate mind, a mind void of
judgment, [Rom 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md). Those that trust
in them act very absurdly and very unreasonably, are senseless,
helpless, useless, like them; and they will find it so themselves, to
their own confusion. We shall know where our God is, and so shall they,
to their cost, when their gods are gone, [Jer
10:3-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#003.md); [Isa
44:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#009.md), etc.

[Psalms 115:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 115:9</span></span>

In these verses,

I. We are earnestly exhorted, all of us, to repose our confidence in
God, and not suffer our confidence in him to be shaken by the heathens'
insulting over us upon the account of our present distresses. It is
folly to trust in dead images, but it is wisdom to trust in the living
God, for he is a help and a shield to those that do trust in them, a
help to furnish them with and forward them in that which is good, and a
shield to fortify them against and protect them from every thing that is
evil. Therefore, 1. Let Israel trust in the Lord; the body of the
people, as to their public interests, and every particular Israelite, as
to his own private concerns, let them leave it to God to dispose of all
for them, and believe it will dispose of all for the best and will be
their help and shield. 2. Let the priests, the Lord's ministers, and all
the families of the house of Aaron, trust in the Lord, ([Psa
115:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#010).md); they are most maligned and
struck at by the enemies and therefore of them God takes particular
care. They ought to be examples to others of a cheerful confidence in
God, and a faithful adherence to him in the worst of times. 3. Let the
proselytes, who are not of the seed of Israel, but fear the Lord, who
worship him and make conscience of their duty to him, let them trust in
him, for he will not fail nor forsake them, [Psa
115:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#011.md). Note, Wherever there is an
awful fear of God, there may be a cheerful faith in him: those that
reverence his word may rely upon it.

II\. We are greatly encouraged to trust in God, and good reason is given
us why we should stay ourselves upon him with an entire satisfaction.
Consider, 1. What we have experienced ([Psa
115:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#012).md): The Lord has been mindful of
us, and never unmindful, has been so constantly, has been so remarkably
upon special occasions. He has been mindful of our case, our wants and
burdens, mindful of our prayers to him, his promises to us, and the
covenant-relation between him and us. All our comforts are derived from
God's thoughts to us-ward; he has been mindful of us, though we have
forgotten him. Let this engage us to trust in him, that we have found
him faithful. 2. What we may expect. From what he has done for us we may
infer, He will bless us; he that has been our help and our shield will
be so; he that has remembered us in our low estate will not forget us;
for he is still the same, his power and goodness the same, and his
promise inviolable; so that we have reason to hope that he who has
delivered, and does, will yet deliver. Yet this is not all: He will
bless us; he has promised that he will; he has pronounced a blessing
upon all his people. God's blessing us is not only speaking good to us,
but doing well for us; those whom he blesses are blessed indeed. It is
particularly promised that he will bless the house of Israel, that is,
he will bless the commonwealth, will bless his people in their civil
interests. He will bless the house of Aaron, that is, the church, the
ministry, will bless his people in their religious concerns. The priests
were to bless the people; it was their office ([Num
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#023).md); but God blessed them, and so
blessed their blessings. Nay ([Psa
115:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#013).md), he will bless those that fear
the Lord, though they be not of the house of Israel or the house of
Aaron; for it was a truth, before Peter perceived it, That in every
nation he that fears God is accepted or him, and blessed, [Act
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034.md), [Act
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#035.md). He will bless them both small
and great, both young and old. God has blessings in store for those that
are good betimes and for those that are old disciples, both those that
are poor in the world and those that make a figure. The greatest need
his blessing, and it shall not be denied to the meanest that fear him.
Both the weak in grace and the strong shall be blessed of God, the lambs
and the sheep of his flock. It is promised ([Psa
115:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#014).md), The Lord shall increase you.
Whom God blesses he increases; that was one of the earliest and most
ancient blessings, Be fruitful and multiply. God's blessing gives an
increase - increase in number, building up the family - increase in
wealth, adding to the estate and honour - especially an increase in
spiritual blessings, with the increasings of God. He will bless you with
the increase of knowledge and wisdom, of grace, holiness, and joy; those
are blessed indeed whom God thus increases, who are made wiser and
better, and fitter for God and heaven. It is promised that this shall
be, (1.) A constant continual increase: "He shall increase you more and
more; so that, as long as you live, you shall be still increasing, till
you come to perfection, as the shining light," [Pro
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018). (2..md) An hereditary increase:
"You and your children; you in your children." It is a comfort to
parents to see their children increasing in wisdom and strength. There
is a blessing entailed upon the seed of those that fear God even in
their infancy. For ([Psa 115:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#015).md), You
are blessed of the Lord, you and your children are so; all that see them
shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the Lord has
blessed, [Isa 59:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#009.md). Those that are the
blessed of the Lord have encouragement enough to trust in the Lord, as
their help and shield, for it is he that made heaven and earth;
therefore his blessings are free, for he needs not any thing himself;
and therefore they are rich, for he has all things at command for us if
we fear him and trust in him. He that made heaven and earth can
doubtless make those happy that trust in him, and will do it.

III\. We are stirred up to praise God by the psalmist's example, who
concludes the psalm with a resolution to persevere in his praises. 1.
God is to be praised, [Psa 115:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#016.md). He
is greatly to be praised; for, (1.) His glory is high. See how stately
his palace is, and the throne he has prepared in the heavens: The
heaven, even the heavens are the Lord's; he is the rightful owner of all
the treasures of light and bliss in the upper and better world, and is
in the full possession of them, for he is himself infinitely bright and
happy. (2.) His goodness is large, for the earth he has given to the
children of men, having designed it, when he made it, for their use, to
find them with meat, drink, and lodging. Not but that still he is
proprietor in chief; the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof;
but he has let out that vineyard to these unthankful husbandmen, and
from them he expects the rents and services; for, though he has given
them the earth, his eye is upon them, and he will call them to render an
account how they use it. Calvin complains that profane wicked people, in
his days, perverted this scripture, and made a jest of it, which some in
our days do, arguing, in banter, that God, having given the earth to the
children of men, will no more look after it, nor after them upon it, but
they may do what they will with it, and make the best of it as their
portion; it is as it were thrown like a prey among them, Let him seize
it that can. It is a pity that such an instance as this gives of God's
bounty to man, and such a proof as arises from it of man's obligation to
God, should be thus abused. From the highest heavens, it is certain, God
beholds all the children of men; to them he has given the earth; but to
the children of God heaven is given. 2. The dead are not capable of
praising him ([Psa 115:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#017).md), nor any
that go into silence. The soul indeed lives in a state of separation
from the body and is capable of praising God; and the souls of the
faithful, after they are delivered from the burdens of the flesh, do
praise God, are still praising him; for they go up to the land of
perfect light and constant business. But the dead body cannot praise
God; death puts an end to our glorifying God in this world of trial and
conflict, to all our services in the field; the grave is a land of
darkness and silence, where there is no work or device. This they plead
with God for deliverance out of the hand of their enemies, "Lord, if
they prevail to cut us off, the idols will carry the day, and there will
be none to praise thee, to bear thy name, and to bear a testimony
against the worshippers of idols." The dead praise not the Lord, so as
we do in the business and for the comforts of this life. See [Psa
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#009.md); [Psa
88:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#010.md). 3. Therefore it concerns us to
praise him ([Psa 115:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#018).md): "But we, we
that are alive, will bless the Lord; we and those that shall come after
us, will do it, from this time forth and for evermore, to the end of
time; we and those we shall remove to, from this time forth and to
eternity. The dead praise not the Lord, therefore we will do it the more
diligently." (1.) Others are dead, and an end is thereby put to their
service, and therefore we will lay out ourselves to do so much the more
for God, that we may fill up the gap. Moses my servant is dead, now
therefore, Joshua, arise. (2.) We ourselves must shortly go to the land
of silence; but, while we do live, we will bless the Lord, will improve
our time and work that work of him that sent us into the world to praise
him before the night comes, and because the night comes, wherein no man
can work. The Lord will bless us ([Psa
115:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#012).md); he will do well for us, and
therefore we will bless him, we will speak well of him. Poor returns for
such receivings! Nay, we will not only do it ourselves, but will engage
others to do it. Praise the Lord; praise him with us; praise him in your
places, as we in ours; praise him when we are gone, that he may be
praised for evermore. Hallelujah.
