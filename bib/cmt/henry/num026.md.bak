### [Numbers Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 26:0</span></span>

This book is called Numbers, from the numberings of the children of
Israel, of which it gives an account. Once they were numbered at Mount
Sinai, in the first year after they came out of Egypt, which we had an
account of, ch. 1 and 2. And now a second time they were numbered in the
plains of Moab, just before they entered Canaan, and of this we have an
account in this chapter. We have, I. Orders given for the doing of it
([Num 26:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#001).md). II. A register of the
families and numbers of each tribe (v. 5-50), and the sum total ([Num
26:51](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#051).md). III. Direction given to divide
the land among them ([Num 26:52-56](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#052).md).
IV. The families and numbers of the Levites by themselves ([Num
26:57-62](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#057).md). V. Notice taken of the
fulfilling of the threatening in the death of all those that were first
numbered ([Num 26:63-65](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#063).md), and to this
there seems to have been a special regard in the taking and keeping of
this account.

[Numbers 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 26:1</span></span>

Observe here, 1. That Moses did not number the people but when God
commanded him. David in his time did it without a command, and paid
dearly for it. God was Israel's king, and he would not have this act of
authority done but by his express orders. Moses, perhaps, by this time,
had heard of the blessing with which Balaam was constrained, sorely
against his will, to bless Israel, and particularly the notice he took
of their numbers; and he was sufficiently pleased with that general
testimony borne to this instance of their strength and honour by an
adversary, though he knew not their numbers exactly, till God now
appointed him to take the sum of them. 2. Eleazar was joined in
commission with him, as Aaron had been before, by which God honoured
Eleazar before the elders of his people, and confirmed his succession.
3. It was presently after the plague that this account was ordered to be
taken, to show that though God had in justice contended with them by
that sweeping pestilence, yet he had not made a full end, nor would he
utterly cast them off. God's Israel shall not be ruined, though it be
severely rebuked. 4. They were now to go by the same rule that they had
gone by in the former numbering, counting those only that were able to
go forth to war, for this was the service now before them.

[Numbers 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 26:5</span></span>

This is the register of the tribes as they were now enrolled, in the
same order that they were numbered in ch. 1. Observe,

I. The account that is here kept of the families of each tribe, which
must not be understood of such as we call families, those that live in a
house together, but such as were the descendants of the several sons of
the patriarchs, by whose names, in honour of them, their posterity
distinguished themselves and one another. The families of the twelve
tribes are thus numbered: - Of Dan but one, for Dan had but one son, and
yet that tribe was the most numerous of all except Judah, [Num
26:42](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#042.md), [Num
26:43](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#043.md). Its beginning was small, but
its latter end greatly increased. Zebulun was divided into three
families, Ephraim into four, Issachar into four, Naphtali into four, and
Reuben into four; Judah, Simeon, and Asher, had five families apiece,
Gad and Benjamin seven apiece, and Manasseh eight. Benjamin brought ten
sons into Egypt ([Gen 46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021).md), but
three of them, it seems either died childless or their families were
extinct, for here we find seven only of those names preserved, and that
whole tribe none of the most numerous; for Providence, in the building
up of families and nations, does not tie itself to probabilities. The
barren hath borne seven, and she that hath many children has waxed
feeble, [Sa1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#005.md).

II\. The numbers of each tribe. And here our best entertainment will be
to compare these numbers with those when they were numbered at Mount
Sinai. The sum total was nearly the same; they were now 1820 fewer than
they were then; yet seven of the tribes had increased in number. Judah
had increased 1900, Issachar 9900, Zebulun 3100, Manasseh 20,500,
Benjamin 10,200, Dan 1700, and Asher 11,900. But the other five had
decreased more than to balance that increase. Reuben had decreased 2770,
Simeon 37,100, Gad 5150, Ephraim 8000, and Naphtali 8000. In this
account we may observe, 1. that all the three tribes that were encamped
under the standard of Judah, who was the ancestor of Christ, had
increased, for his church shall be edified and multiplied. 2. That none
of the tribes had increased so much as that of Manasseh, which in the
former account was the smallest of all the tribes, only 32,200, while
here it is one of the most considerable; and that of his brother
Ephraim, which there was numerous, is here one of the least. Jacob had
crossed hands upon their heads, and had preferred Ephraim before
Manasseh, which perhaps the Ephraimites had prided themselves too much
in, and had trampled upon their brethren the Manassites; but, when the
Lord saw that Manasseh was despised, he thus multiplied him exceedingly,
for it is his glory to help the weakest, and raise up those that are
cast down. 3. That none of the tribes decreased so much as Simeon did;
from 59,300, it such to 22,200, little more than a third part of what it
was. One whole family of that tribe (namely Ohad, mentioned [Exo
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#015).md) was extinct in the wilderness.
Hence Simeon is not mentioned in Moses's blessing (Deu. 33), and the lot
of that tribe in Canaan was inconsiderable, only a canton out of Judah's
lot, [Jos 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#009.md). Some conjecture that
most of those 24,000 who were cut off by the plague for the iniquity of
Peor were of that tribe; for Zimri, who was a ringleader in that
iniquity, was a prince of that tribe, many of whom therefore were
influenced by his example to follow his pernicious ways.

III\. In the account of the tribe of Reuben mention is made of the
rebellion of Dathan and Abiram, who were of that tribe, in confederacy
with Korah a Levite, [Num 26:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#009.md).
Though the story had been largely related but a few chapters before, yet
here it comes in again, as fit to be had in remembrance and thought of
by posterity, whenever they looked into their pedigree and pleased
themselves with the antiquity of their families and the glory of their
ancestors, that they might call themselves a seed of evil doers. Two
things are here said of them: - 1. That they had been famous in the
congregation, [Num 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#009.md). Probably they
were remarkable for their ingenuity, activity, and fitness for business:
- That Dathan and Abiram that might have been advanced in due time under
God and Moses; but their ambitious spirits put them upon striving
against God and Moses, and when they quarrelled with the one they
quarrelled with the other. And what was the issue? 2. Those that might
have been famous were made infamous: they became a sign, [Num
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#010.md). They were made monuments of
divine justice; God, in their ruin, showed himself glorious in holiness,
and so they were set up for a warning to all others, in all ages, to
take heed of treading in the steps of their pride and rebellion. Notice
is here taken of the preservation of the children of Korah ([Num
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#011).md); they died not, as the children
of Dathan and Abiram did, doubtless because they kept themselves pure
from the infection, and would not join, no, not with their own father,
in rebellion. If we partake not of the sins of sinners, we shall not
partake of their plagues. These sons of Korah were afterwards, in their
posterity, eminently serviceable to the church, being employed by David
as singers in the house of the Lord; hence many psalms are said to be
for the sons of Korah: and perhaps they were made to bear his name so
long after, rather than the name of any other of their ancestors, for
warning to themselves, and as an instance of the power of God, which
brought those choice fruits even out of that bitter root. The children
of families that have been stigmatized should endeavour, by their
eminent virtues, to roll away the reproach of their fathers.

[Numbers 26:52](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">num 26:52</span></span>

If any ask why such a particular account is kept of the tribes, and
families, and numbers, of the people of Israel, here is an answer for
them; as they were multiplied, so they were portioned, not by common
providence, but by promise; and, for the support of the honour of divine
revelation, God will have the fulfilling of the promise taken notice of
both in their increase and in their inheritance. When Moses had numbered
the people God did not say, By these shall the land be conquered; but,
taking that for granted, he tells him, Unto these shall the land be
divided. "These that are now registered as the sons of Israel shall be
admitted (as it were by copy of court-roll) heirs of the land of
Canaan." Now, in the distributing, or quartering, of these tribes, 1.
The general rule of equity is here prescribed to Moses, that to many he
should give more, and to few he should give less ([Num
26:54](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#054).md); yet, alas! he was so far from
giving any to others that he must not have any himself, but this
direction given to him was intended for Joshua his successor. 2. The
application of this general rule was to be determined by lot (v. 55);
notwithstanding it seems thus to be left to the prudence of their
prince, yet the matter must be finally reserved to the providence of
their God, in which they must all acquiesce, how much soever it
contradicted their policies or inclination: According to the lot shall
the possession be divided. As the God of nations, so the God of Israel
in particular, reserves it to himself to appoint the bounds of our
habitation. And thus Christ, our Joshua, when he was urged to appoint
one of his disciples to his right hand, another to his left in his
kingdom, acknowledged the sovereignty of his Father in the disposal: It
is not mine to give. Joshua must not dispose of inheritances in Canaan
according to his own mind. But it shall be given to those for whom it is
prepared of my Father.

[Numbers 26:57](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">num 26:57</span></span>

Levi was God's tribe, a tribe that was to have no inheritance with the
rest in the land of Canaan, and therefore was not numbered with the
rest, but by itself; so it had been numbered in the beginning of this
book at Mount Sinai, and therefore came not under the sentence passed
upon all that were then numbered, that none of them should enter Canaan
but Caleb and Joshua; for of the Levites that were not numbered with
them, nor were to go forth to war, Eleazar and Ithamar, and perhaps
others who were above twenty years old then (as appears, [Jos
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#016), 28.md), entered Canaan; and yet
this tribe, now at its second numbering, had increased but 1000, and was
still one of the smallest tribes. Mention is made here of the death of
Nadab and Abihu for offering strange fire, as before of the sin and
punishment of Korah, because these things happened to them for
ensamples.

[Numbers 26:63](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#063.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">num 26:63</span></span>

That which is observable in this conclusion of the account is the
execution of the sentence passed upon the murmurers ([Num
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#029).md), that not one of those who were
numbered from twenty years old and upwards (and that the Levites were
not, but either from a month old or from thirty years old to fifty)
should enter Canaan, except Caleb and Joshua. In the muster now made
particular directions, no doubt, were given to those of each tribe that
were employed in taking the account, to compare these rolls with the
former, and to observe whether there were any now left of those that
were numbered at Mount Sinai, and it appeared that there was not one man
numbered now that was numbered then except Caleb and Joshua, [Num
26:64](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#064.md), [Num
26:65](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#065.md). Herein appeared, 1. The
righteousness of God, and his faithfulness to his threatenings, when
once the decree has gone forth. He swore in his wrath, and what he had
sworn he performed. Better all those carcasses, had they been ten times
as many, should fall to the ground, than the word of God. Though the
rising generation was mixed with the, and many of the guilty and
condemned criminals long survived the sentence, even to the last year of
the forty, yet they were cut off by some means or other before this
muster was made. Those whom God has condemned cannot escape either by
losing themselves in a crowd or by the delay of execution. 2. The
goodness of God to this people, notwithstanding their provocations.
Though that murmuring race was cut off, yet God raised up another
generation, which was as numerous as they, that, though they perished,
yet the name of Israel might not be cut off, lest the inheritance of the
promise should be lost for want of heirs. And, though the number fell a
little short what it was at Mount Sinai, yet those now numbered had this
advantage, that they were all middle-aged men, between twenty and sixty,
in the prime of their time for service; and during the thirty-eight
years of their wandering and wasting in the wilderness they had an
opportunity of acquainting themselves with the laws and ordinances of
God, having no business, civil or military, to divert them from those
sacred studies, and having Moses and Aaron to instruct them, and God's
good Spirit, [Neh 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#020.md). 3. The truth
of God, in performing his promise made to Caleb and Joshua. They were to
be preserved from falling in this common ruin, and they were so. The
arrows of death, though they fly in the dark, do not fly at random, even
when they fly thickest, but are directed to the mark intended, and no
other. All that are written among the living shall have their lives
given them for a prey, in the most dangerous times. Thousands may fall
on their right hand, and ten thousands on their left, but they shall
escape.
