### [Deuteronomy Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 10:0</span></span>

Moses having, in the foregoing chapter, reminded them of their own sin,
as a reason why they should not depend upon their own righteousness, in
this chapter he sets before them God's great mercy to them,
notwithstanding their provocations, as a reason why they should be more
obedient for the future. I. He mentions divers tokens of God's favour
and reconciliation to them, never to be forgotten. (1.) The renewing of
the tables of the covenant ([Deu
10:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#001)). (2..md) Giving orders for their
progress towards Canaan ([Deu 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#006.md),
[Deu 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#007)). (3..md) Choosing the tribe of
Levi for his own ([Deu 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#008.md), [Deu
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#009)). (4..md) And continuing the
priesthood after the death of Aaron ([Deu
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#006)). (5..md) Owning and accepting the
intercession of Moses for them ([Deu
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#010.md), [Deu
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#011).md). II. Hence he infers what
obligations they lay under to fear, and love, and serve God, which he
presses upon them with many motives ([Deu
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#012), etc..md).

[Deuteronomy 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 10:1</span></span>

There were four things in and by which God showed himself reconciled to
Israel and made them truly great and happy, and in which God's goodness
took occasion from their badness to make him the more illustrious: -

I. He gave them his law, gave it to them in writing, as a standing
pledge of his favour. Though the tables that were first written were
broken, because Israel had broken the commandments, and God might justly
break the covenant, yet when his anger was turned away the tables were
renewed, [Deu 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#001.md), [Deu
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#002.md). Note, God's putting his law in
our reconciliation to God and the best earnest of our happiness in him.
Moses is told to hew the tables; for the law prepares the heart by
conviction and humiliation for the grace of God, but it is only that
grace that then writes the law in it. Moses made an ark of shittim-wood
([Deu 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#003).md), a plain chest, the same,
I suppose, in which the tables were afterwards preserved: but Bezaleel
is said to make it ([Exo 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#001).md),
because he afterwards finished it up and overlaid it with gold. Or Moses
is said to make it because, when he went up the second time into the
mount, he ordered it to be made by Bezaleel against he came down. And it
is observable that for this reason the ark was the first thing that God
gave orders about, [Exo 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#010.md). And
this left an earnest to the congregation that the tables should not
miscarry this second time, as they had done the first. God will send his
law and gospel to those whose hearts are prepared as arks to receive
them. Christ is the ark in which now our salvation is kept safely, that
it may not be lost as it was in the first Adam, when he had it in his
own hand. Observe, 1. What it was that God wrote on the two tables, the
ten commandments ([Deu 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#004).md), or ten
words, intimating in how little a compass they were contained: they were
not ten volumes, but ten words: it was the same with the first writing,
and both the same that he spoke in the mount. The second edition needed
no correction nor amendment, nor did what he wrote differ form what he
spoke. The written word is as truly the word of God as that which he
spoke to his servants the prophets. 2. What care was taken of it. These
two tables, thus engraven, were faithfully laid up in the ark. And there
they be, said Moses, pointing it is probable towards the sanctuary, [Deu
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#005.md). That good thing which was
committed to him he transmitted to them, and left it pure and entire in
their hands; now let them look to it at their peril. Thus we may say to
the rising generation, "God has entrusted us with Bibles, sabbaths,
sacraments, etc., as tokens of his presence and favour, and there they
be; we lodge them with you," [Ti2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013.md), [Ti2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#014.md).

II\. He led them forward towards Canaan, though they in their hearts
turned back towards Egypt, and he might justly have chosen their
delusions, [Deu 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#006.md), [Deu
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#007.md). He brought them to a land of
rivers of waters, out of a dry and barren wilderness. Sometimes God
supplied their wants by the ordinary course of nature: when that failed,
then by miracles; and yet after this, when they were brought into a
little distress, we find them distrusting God and murmuring, [Num
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#003.md), [Num
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#004.md).

III\. He appointed a standing ministry among them, to deal for them in
holy things. At that time when Moses went up a second time to the mount,
or soon after, he had orders to separate the tribe of Levi to God, and
to his immediate service, they having distinguished themselves by their
zeal against the worshippers of the golden calf, [Deu
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#008.md), [Deu
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#009.md). The Kohathites carried the ark;
they and the other Levites stood before the Lord, to minister to him in
all the offices of the tabernacle; and the priests, who were of that
tribe, were to bless the people. This was a standing ordinance, which
had now continued almost forty years, even unto this day; and provision
was made for the perpetuating of it by the settled maintenance of that
tribe, which was such as gave them great encouragement in their work,
and no diversion from it. The Lord is his inheritance. Note, A settled
ministry is a great blessing to a people, and a special token of God's
favour. And, since the particular priests could not continue by reason
of death, God showed his care of the people in securing a succession,
which Moses takes notice of here, [Deu
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#006.md). When Aaron died, the priesthood
did not die with him, but Eleazar his son ministered in his stead, and
took care of the ark, in which the tables of stone, those precious
stones, were deposited, that they should suffer no damage; there they
be, and he has the custody of them. Under the law, a succession in the
ministry was kept up, by an entail of the office on a certain tribe and
family. But now, under the gospel, when the effusion of the Spirit is
more plentiful and powerful, the succession is kept up by the Spirit's
operation on men's hearts, qualifying men for, and inclining men to,
that work, some in every age, that the name of Israel may not be blotted
out.

IV\. He accepted Moses as an advocate or intercessor for them, and
therefore constituted him their prince and leader ([Deu
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#010.md), [Deu
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#011).md): The Lord hearkened to me and
said, Arise, go before the people. It was a mercy to them that they had
such a friend, so faithful both to him that appointed him and to those
for whom he was appointed. It was fit that he who had saved them from
ruin, by his intercession with heaven, should have the conduct and
command of them. And herein he was a type of Christ, who, as he ever
lives making intercession for us, so he has all power both in heaven and
in earth.

[Deuteronomy 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 10:12</span></span>

Here is a most pathetic exhortation to obedience, inferred from the
premises, and urged with very powerful arguments and a great deal of
persuasive rhetoric. Moses brings it in like an orator, with an appeal
to his auditors And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of
thee? [Deu 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#012.md). Ask what he
requires; as David ([Psa 116:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#012).md), What
shall I render? When we have received mercy from God it becomes us to
enquire what returns we shall make to him. Consider what he requires,
and you will find it is nothing but what is highly just and reasonable
in itself and of unspeakable benefit and advantage to you. Let us see
here what he does require, and what abundant reason there is why we
should do what he requires.

I. We are here most plainly directed in our duty to God, to our
neighbour, and to ourselves.

1\. We are here taught our duty to God, both in the dispositions and
affections of our souls and in the actions of our lives, our principles
and our practices. (1.) We must fear the Lord our God, [Deu
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#012.md), and again [Deu
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#020.md). We must adore his majesty,
acknowledge his authority, stand in awe of his power, and dread his
wrath. This is gospel duty, [Rev 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006.md),
[Rev 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#007). (2..md) We must love him, be
well pleased that he is, desire that he may be ours, and delight in the
contemplation of him and in communion with him. Fear him as a great God,
and our Lord, love him as a good God, and our Father and benefactor.
(3.) We must walk in his ways, that is, the ways which he has appointed
us to walk in. The whole course of our conversation must be conformable
to his holy will. (4.) We must serve him ([Deu
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#020).md), serve him with all our heart
and soul ([Deu 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#012).md), devote
ourselves to his honour, put ourselves under his government, and lay out
ourselves to advance all the interests of his kingdom among men. And we
must be hearty and zealous in his service, engage and employ our inward
man in his work, and what we do for him we must do cheerfully and with a
good will. (5.) We must keep his commandments and his statutes, [Deu
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#013.md). Having given up ourselves to
his service, we must make his revealed will our rule in every thing,
perform all he prescribes, forbear all the forbids, firmly believing
that all the statutes he commands us are for our good. Besides the
reward of obedience, which will be our unspeakable gain, there are true
honour and pleasure in obedience. It is really for our present good to
be meek and humble, chaste and sober, just and charitable, patient and
contented; these make us easy, and safe, and pleasant, and truly great.
(6.) We must give honour to God, in swearing by his name ([Deu
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#020).md); so give him the honour of his
omniscience, his sovereignty, his justice, as well as of his necessary
existence. Swear by his name, and not by the name of any creature, or
false god, whenever an oath for confirmation is called for. (7.) To him
we must cleave, [Deu 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#020.md). Having
chosen him for our God, we must faithfully and constantly abide with him
and never forsake him. Cleave to him as one we love and delight in,
trust and confide in, and from whom we have great expectations.

2\. We are here taught our duty to our neighbour ([Deu
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#019).md): Love the stranger; and, if the
stranger, much more our brethren, as ourselves. If the Israelites that
were such a peculiar people, so particularly distinguished from all
people, must be kind to strangers, much more must we, that are not
enclosed in such a pale; we must have a tender concern for all that
share with us in the human nature, and as we have opportunity; (that is,
according to their necessities and our abilities) we must do good to all
men. Two arguments are here urged to enforce this duty: - (1.) God's
common providence, which extends itself to all nations of men, they
being all made of one blood. God loveth the stranger ([Deu
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#018).md), that is, he gives to all life,
and breath, and all things, even to those that are Gentiles, and
strangers to the commonwealth of Israel and to Israel's God. He knows
those perfectly whom we know nothing of. He gives food and raiment even
to those to whom he has not shown his word and statutes. God's common
gifts to mankind oblige us to honour all men. Or the expression denotes
the particular care which Providence takes of strangers in distress,
which we ought to praise him for ([Psa
146:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#009.md), The Lord preserveth the
strangers), and to imitate him, to serve him, and concur with him
therein, being forward to make ourselves instruments in his hand of
kindness to strangers. (2.) The afflicted condition which the Israelites
themselves had been in, when they were strangers in Egypt. Those that
have themselves been in distress, and have found mercy with God, should
sympathize most feelingly with those that are in the like distress and
be ready to show kindness to them. The people of the Jews,
notwithstanding these repeated commands given them to be kind to
strangers, conceived a rooted antipathy to the Gentiles, whom they
looked upon with the utmost disdain, which made them envy the grace of
God and the gospel of Christ, and this brought a final ruin upon
themselves.

3\. We are here taught our duty to ourselves ([Deu
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#016).md): Circumcise the foreskin of
your hearts. that is, "Cast away from you all corrupt affections and
inclinations, which hinder you from fearing and loving God. Mortify the
flesh with the lusts of it. Away with all filthiness and superfluity of
naughtiness, which obstruct the free course of the word of God to your
hearts. Rest not in the circumcision of the body, which was only the
sign, but be circumcised in heart, which is the thing signified." See
[Rom 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029.md). The command of Christ goes
further than this, and obliges us not only to cut off the foreskin of
the heart, which may easily be spared, but to cut off the right hand and
to pluck out the right eye that is an offence to us; the more spiritual
the dispensation is the more spiritual we are obliged to be, and to go
the closer in mortifying sin. And be no more stiff-necked, as they had
been hitherto, [Deu 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#024.md). "Be not any
longer obstinate against divine commands and corrections, but ready to
comply with the will of God in both." The circumcision of the heart
makes it ready to yield to God, and draw in his yoke.

II\. We are here most pathetically persuaded to our duty. Let but reason
rule us, and religion will.

1\. Consider the greatness and glory of God, and therefore fear him, and
from that principle serve and obey him. What is it that is thought to
make a man great, but great honour, power, and possessions? Think then
how great the Lord our God is, and greatly to be feared. (1.) He has
great honour, a name above every name. He is God of gods, and Lord of
lords, [Deu 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#017.md). Angels are called
gods, so are magistrates, and the Gentiles had gods many, and lords
many, the creatures of their own fancy; but God is infinitely above all
these nominal deities. What an absurdity would it be for them to worship
other gods when the God to whom they had sworn allegiance was the God of
gods! (2.) He has great power. He is a mighty God and terrible ([Deu
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#017).md), who regardeth not persons. He
has the power of a conqueror, and so he is terrible to those that resist
him and rebel against him. He has the power of a judge, and so he is
just to all those that appeal to him or appear before him. And it is as
much the greatness and honour of a judge to be impartial in his justice,
without respect to persons or bribes, as it is to a general to be
terrible to the enemy. Our God is both. (3.) He has great possessions.
Heaven and earth are his ([Deu 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#014).md),
and all the hosts and stars of both. Therefore he is able to bear us out
in his service, and to make up the losses we sustain in discharging our
duty to him. And yet therefore he has no need of us, nor any thing we
have or can do; we are undone without him, but he is happy without us,
which makes the condescensions of his grace, in accepting us and our
services, truly admirable. Heaven and earth are his possession, and yet
the Lord's portion is his people.

2\. Consider the goodness and grace of God, and therefore love him, and
from that principle serve and obey him. His goodness is his glory as
much as his greatness. (1.) He is good to all. Whomsoever he finds
miserable, to them he will be found merciful: He executes the judgment
of the fatherless and widow, [Deu
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#018.md). It is his honour to help the
helpless, and to succour those that most need relief and that men are
apt to do injury to, or at least to put a light upon. See [Psa
68:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#004.md), [Psa
68:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#005.md); [Psa
146:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#007.md), [Psa
146:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#009). (2..md) But truly God is good to
Israel in a special obligations to him: "He is they praise, and he is
thy God, [Deu 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#021.md). Therefore love
him and serve him, because of the relation wherein he stands to thee. He
is thy God, a God in covenant with thee, and as such he is thy praise,"
that is \[1.\] "He puts honour upon thee; he is the God in whom, all the
day long, thou mayest boast that thou knowest him, and art known of him.
If he is thy God, he is thy glory." \[2.\] "He expects honour from thee.
He is thy praise," that is "he is the God whom thou art bound to praise;
if he has not praise from thee, whence may he expect it?" He inhabits
the praises of Israel. Consider, First, The gracious choice he made of
Israel, [Deu 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#015.md). "He had a delight
in thy fathers, and therefore chose their seed." Not that there was any
thing in them to merit his favour, or to recommend them to it, but so it
seemed good in his eyes. He would be kind to them, though he had no need
of them. Secondly, The great things he had done for Israel, [Deu
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#021.md), [Deu
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#022.md). He reminds them not only of
what they had heard with their ears, and which their fathers had told
them of, but of what they had seen with their eyes, and which they must
tell their children of, particularly that within a few generations
seventy souls (for they were no more when Jacob went down into Egypt)
increased to a great nation, as the stars of heaven for multitude. And
the more they were in number the more praise and service God expected
from them; yet it proved, as in the old world, that when they began to
multiply they corrupted themselves.
