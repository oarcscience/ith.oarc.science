### Young's Literal Translation: Philemon

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and
Timotheus the brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> and Apphia the beloved, and Archippus our
fellow-soldier, and the assembly in thy house:

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Grace to you, and peace, from God our
Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> I give thanks to my God, always making
mention of thee in my prayers,

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> hearing of thy love and faith that thou
hast unto the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> that the fellowship of thy faith may become
working in the full knowledge of every good thing that \[is\] in you
toward Christ Jesus;

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> for we have much joy and comfort in thy
love, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed through thee,
brother.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Wherefore, having in Christ much boldness
to command thee that which is fit --

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> because of the love I rather entreat, being
such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ;

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> I entreat thee concerning my child --
whom I did beget in my bonds -- Onesimus,

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> who once was to thee unprofitable, and
now is profitable to me and to thee,

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> whom I did send again, and thou him (that
is, my own bowels) receive,

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> whom I did wish to retain to myself, that
in thy behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the good news,

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> and apart from thy mind I willed to do
nothing, that as of necessity thy good deed may not be, but of
willingness,

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> for perhaps because of this he did depart
for an hour, that age-duringly thou mayest have him,

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> no more as a servant, but above a servant
-- a brother beloved, especially to me, and how much more to thee, both
in the flesh and in the Lord!

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> If, then, with me thou hast fellowship,
receive him as me,

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> and if he did hurt to thee, or doth owe
anything, this to me be reckoning;

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> I, Paul did write with my hand, I -- I
will repay; that I may not say that also thyself, besides, to me thou
dost owe.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> Yes, brother, may I have profit of thee
in the Lord; refresh my bowels in the Lord;

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> having been confident in thy obedience I
did write to thee, having known that also above what I may say thou wilt
do;

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> and at the same time also prepare for me
a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted to
you.

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> Salute thee doth Epaphras, (my
fellow-captive in Christ Jesus,)

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> Markus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lukas, my
fellow-workmen!

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ \[is\]
with your spirit! Amen.
