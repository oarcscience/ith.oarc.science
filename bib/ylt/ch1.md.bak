unto the east of the valley, to seek pasture for their flock,

<span id="an_4:40">4:40</span> and they find pasture, fat and good, and
the land broad of sides, and quiet, and safe, for of Ham are those
dwelling there before.

<span id="an_4:41">4:41</span> And these who are written by name come in
the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and smite their tents, and the
habitations that have been found there, and devote them to destruction
unto this day, and dwell in their stead, because pasture for their flock
\[is\] there.

escaped of Amalek, and dwell there unto this day.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> As to sons of Reuben, first-born of Israel
-- for he \[is\] the first-born, and on account of his profaning the
couch of his father hath his birthright been given to the sons of Joseph
son of Israel, and \[he is\] not to be reckoned by genealogy for the
birthright,

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> for Judah hath been mighty over his
brother, and for leader above him, and the birthright \[is\] to Joseph.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> Sons of Reuben, first-born of Israel:
Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.

Joel -- he is dwelling in Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baal-Meon;

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> and at the east he dwelt even unto the
entering in of the wilderness, even from the river Phrat, for their
cattle were multiplied in the land of Gilead.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> And in the days of Saul they have made
war with the Hagarites, who fall by their hand, and they dwell in their
tents over all the face of the east of Gilead.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> And the sons of Gad, over-against them

sword, and treading bow, and taught in battle, \[are\] forty and four

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> And they make war with the Hagarites, and
Jetur, and Naphish, and Nodab,

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> and they are helped against them, and the
Hagarites are given into their hand, and all who \[are\] with them, for
they cried to God in battle, and He was entreated of them, because they
trusted in Him.

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> And they take captive their cattle, of
their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty
thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of human beings a hundred
thousand;

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> for many have fallen pierced, for of God
\[is\] the battle; and they dwell in their stead till the removal.

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> And the sons of the half of the tribe of

their fathers, even Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and
Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, men mighty in valour, men of name,
heads to the house of their fathers.

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> And they trespass against the God of
their fathers, and go a-whoring after the gods of the peoples of the
land whom God destroyed from their presence;

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> and stir up doth the God of Israel the
spirit of Pul king of Asshur, and the spirit of Tilgath-Pilneser king of
Asshur, and he removeth them -- even the Reubenite, and the Gadite, and
the half of the tribe of Manasseh -- and bringeth them in to Halah, and

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> and the Philistines pursue after Saul,
and after his sons, and the Philistines smite Jonathan, and Abinadab,
and Malchi-Shua, sons of Saul.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> And the battle \[is\] heavy on Saul, and
those shooting with the bow find him, and he is wounded by those
shooting,

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> and Saul saith unto the bearer of his
weapons, \`Draw thy sword, and pierce me with it, lest these
uncircumcised come -- and have abused me.' And the bearer of his weapons
hath not been willing, for he feareth exceedingly, and Saul taketh the
sword, and falleth upon it;

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> and the bearer of his weapons seeth that
Saul \[is\] dead, and falleth, he also, on the sword, and dieth;

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> and Saul dieth, and his three sons, and
all his house -- together they died.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> And all the men of Israel who \[are\] in
the valley see that they have fled, and that Saul and his sons have
died, and they forsake their cities and flee, and the Philistines come
and dwell in them.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> And it cometh to pass, on the morrow,
that the Philistines come to strip the wounded, and find Saul and his
sons fallen in mount Gilboa,

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> and strip him, and bear away his head,
and his weapons, and send into the land of the Philistines round about
to proclaim tidings \[to\] their idols and the people,

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> and put his weapons in the house of
their gods, and his skull they have fixed in the house of Dagon.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> And all Jabesh-Gilead hear of all that
the Philistines have done to Saul,

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> and all the men of valour rise and bear
away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and bring them in to
Jabesh, and bury their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fast seven
days.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> And Saul dieth because of his trespass
that he trespassed against Jehovah, against the word of Jehovah that he
kept not, and also for asking at a familiar spirit -- to inquire, --

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> and he inquired not at Jehovah, and He
putteth him to death, and turneth round the kingdom to David son of
Jesse.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> And gathered are all Israel unto David to
Hebron, saying, \`Lo, thy bone and thy flesh \[are\] we;

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> even in time past, even in Saul's being
king, it is thou who art taking out and bringing in Israel, and Jehovah
thy God saith to thee: Thou dost feed My people Israel, and thou art
leader over My people Israel.'

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> And all the elders of Israel come in unto
the king to Hebron, and David maketh with them a covenant in Hebron
before Jehovah, and they anoint David for king over Israel, according to
the word of Jehovah by the hand of Samuel.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> And David goeth, and all Israel, to
Jerusalem -- it \[is\] Jebus -- and there the Jebusite, the inhabitants
of the land.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> And the inhabitants of Jebus say to
David, \`Thou dost not come in hither;' and David captureth the fortress
of Zion -- it \[is\] the city of David.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> And David saith, \`Whoever smiteth the
Jebusite first doth become head and prince;' and go up first doth Joab
son of Zeruiah and becometh head.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> And David dwelleth in the fortress,
therefore they have called it, \`City of David;'

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> and he buildeth the city round about,
from Millo, and unto the circumference, and Joab restoreth the rest of
the city.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> And David goeth, going on and becoming
great, and Jehovah of Hosts \[is\] with him.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> And these \[are\] heads of the mighty
ones whom David hath, who are strengthening themselves with him in his
kingdom, with all Israel, to cause him to reign, according to the word
of Jehovah, over Israel.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> And this \[is\] an account of the
mighty ones whom David hath: Jashobeam son of a Hachmonite \[is\] head
of the thirty; he is lifting up his spear against three hundred --
wounded, at one time.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> And after him \[is\] Eleazar son of
Dodo the Ahohite, he \[is\] among the three mighty;

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> he hath been with David in Pas-Dammim,
and the Philistines have been gathered there to battle, and a portion of
the field is full of barley, and the people have fled from the face of
the Philistines,

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> and they station themselves in the
midst of the portion, and deliver it, and smite the Philistines, and
Jehovah saveth -- a great salvation.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> And three of the thirty heads go down
on the rock unto David, unto the cave of Adullam, and the host of the
Philistines is encamping in the valley of Rephaim,

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> and David \[is\] then in the fortress,
and the station of the Philistines \[is\] then in Beth-Lehem,

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> and David longeth, and saith, \`Who
doth give me to drink water from the well of Beth-Lehem, that \[is\] at
the gate!'

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> And the three break through the camp of
the Philistines, and draw water from the well of Beth-Lehem, that \[is\]
at the gate, and bear and bring in unto David, and David hath not been
willing to drink it, and poureth it out to Jehovah,

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> and saith, \`Far be it from me, by my
God, to do this; the blood of these men do I drink with their lives? for
with their lives they have brought it;' and he was not willing to drink
it; these \[things\] did the three mighty ones.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> And Abishai brother of Joab, he hath
been head of the three: and he is lifting up his spear against three
hundred -- wounded, and hath a name among three.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> Of the three by the two he is honoured,
and becometh their head; and unto the \[first\] three he hath not come.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> Benaiah son of Jehoiada, son of a man
of valour, of great deeds, from Kabzeel: he hath smitten the two
lion-like Moabites, and he hath gone down and smitten the lion in the
midst of the pit, in the day of snow.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> And he hath smitten the man, the
Egyptian -- a man of measure, five by the cubit -- and in the hand of
the Egyptian \[is\] a spear like a beam of weavers, and he goeth down
unto him with a rod, and taketh violently away the spear out of the hand
of the Egyptian, and slayeth him with his own spear.

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> These \[things\] hath Benaiah son of
Jehoiada done, and hath a name among the three mighty ones.

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> Of the thirty, lo, he \[is\] honoured,
and unto the \[first\] three he hath not come, and David setteth him
over his guard.

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> Jeremiah the tenth, Machbannai the
eleventh.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> These \[are\] of the sons of Gad, heads
of the host, one of a hundred \[is\] the least, and the greatest, of a
thousand;

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> these \[are\] they who have passed over
the Jordan in the first month, -- and it is full over all its banks --
and cause all \[they of\] the valley to flee to the east and to the
west.

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> And there come of the sons of Benjamin
and Judah unto the stronghold to David,

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> and David goeth out before them, and
answereth and saith to them, \`If for peace ye have come in unto me, to
help me, I have a heart to unite with you; and if to betray me to mine
adversaries -- without violence in my hands -- the God of our fathers
doth see and reprove.'

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> And the Spirit hath clothed Amasai,
head of the captains: \`To thee, O David, and with thee, O son of Jesse
-- peace! peace to thee, and peace to thy helper, for thy God hath
helped thee;' and David receiveth them, and putteth them among the heads
of the troop.

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> And of Manasseh there have fallen unto
David in his coming with the Philistines against Israel to battle -- and
they helped them not, for by counsel the princes of the Philistines sent
him away, saying, \`With our heads he doth fall unto his master Saul.'
--

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> In his going unto Ziglag there have
fallen unto him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and
Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillthai, heads of the thousands
that \[are\] of Manasseh;

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> and they have helped with David over
the troop, for mighty of valour \[are\] all of them, and they are
captains in the host,

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> for at that time, day by day, they come
in unto David to help him, till it is a great camp, like a camp of God.

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> And these \[are\] the numbers of the
head, of the armed men of the host; they have come in unto David to
Hebron to turn round the kingdom of Saul unto him, according to the
mouth of Jehovah.

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> The sons of Judah, bearing target and
spear, \[are\] six thousand and eight hundred, armed ones of the host.

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> Of the sons of Simeon, mighty ones of
valour for the host, \[are\] seven thousand and a hundred.

<span id="an_12:26">12:26</span> Of the sons of Levi \[are\] four
thousand and six hundred;

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> and Jehoiada \[is\] the leader of the
Aaronite, and with him \[are\] three thousand and seven hundred,

<span id="an_12:28">12:28</span> and Zadok, a young man, mighty of
valour, and of the house of his father \[are\] twenty and two heads.

<span id="an_12:29">12:29</span> And of the sons of Benjamin, brethren
of Saul, \[are\] three thousand, and hitherto their greater part are
keeping the charge of the house of Saul.

<span id="an_12:30">12:30</span> And of the sons of Ephraim \[are\]
twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty of valour, men of name,
according to the house of their fathers.

<span id="an_12:31">12:31</span> And of the half of the tribe of
Manasseh \[are\] eighteen thousand, who have been defined by name, to
come in to cause David to reign.

<span id="an_12:32">12:32</span> And of the sons of Issachar, having
understanding for the times, to know what Israel should do; their heads
\[are\] two hundred, and all their brethren \[are\] at their command.

<span id="an_12:33">12:33</span> Of Zebulun, going forth to the host,
arranging battle with all instruments of battle, \[are\] fifty thousand,
and keeping rank without a double heart.

<span id="an_12:34">12:34</span> And of Naphtali, a thousand heads, and
with them, with target and spear, \[are\] thirty and seven thousand.

<span id="an_12:35">12:35</span> And of the Danite, arranging battle,
\[are\] twenty and eight thousand and six hundred.

<span id="an_12:36">12:36</span> And of Asher, going forth to the host,
to arrange battle, \[are\] forty thousand.

<span id="an_12:37">12:37</span> And from beyond the Jordan, of the
Reubenite, and of the Gadite, and of the half of the tribe of Manasseh,
with all instruments of the host for battle, \[are\] a hundred and
twenty thousand.

<span id="an_12:38">12:38</span> All these \[are\] men of war, keeping
rank -- with a perfect heart they have come to Hebron, to cause David to
reign over all Israel, and also all the rest of Israel \[are\] of one
heart, to cause David to reign,

<span id="an_12:39">12:39</span> and they are there, with David, three
days, eating and drinking, for their brethren have prepared for them.

<span id="an_12:40">12:40</span> And also those near unto them, unto
Issachar, and Zebulun, and Naphtali, are bringing in bread on asses, and
on camels, and on mules, and on oxen -- food of fine flour, fig-cakes
and grape-cakes, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep, in abundance,
for joy \[is\] in Israel.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> And David consulteth with the heads of
the thousands, and of the hundreds, every leader,

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> and David saith to all the assembly of
Israel, \`If unto you it be good, and from Jehovah our God it hath
broken forth -- we send unto our brethren, those left in all the lands
of Israel, and with them the priests and the Levites, in the cities of
their suburbs, and they are gathered unto us,

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> and we bring round the ark of our God
unto us, for we sought Him not in the days of Saul.'

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> And all the assembly say to do so, for
the thing is right in the eyes of all the people.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> And David assembleth all Israel from
Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering in of Hamath, to bring in the ark
of God from Kirjath-Jearim,

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> and David goeth up, and all Israel, to
Baalah, unto Kirjath-Jearim that \[is\] to Judah, to bring up thence the
ark of God Jehovah, inhabiting the cherubs, where the Name is called on.

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> And they place the ark of God on a new
cart, from the house of Abinadab, and Uzza and Ahio are leading the
cart,

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> and David and all Israel are playing
before God, with all strength, and with songs, and with harps, and with
psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> And they come in unto the threshing-floor
of Chidon, and Uzza putteth forth his hand to seize the ark, for the
oxen were released,

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> and the anger of Jehovah is kindled
against Uzza, and He smiteth him, because that he hath put forth his
hand on the ark, and he dieth there before God.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> And it is displeasing to David, because
Jehovah hath made a breach upon Uzza, and one calleth that place
\`Breach of Uzza' unto this day.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> And David feareth God on that day,
saying, \`How do I bring in unto me the ark of God?'

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> And David hath not turned aside the ark
unto himself, unto the city of David, and turneth it aside unto the
house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> And the ark of God dwelleth with the
household of Obed-Edom, in his house, three months, and Jehovah blesseth
the house of Obed-Edom, and all that he hath.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> And Huram king of Tyre sendeth messengers
unto David, and cedar-wood, and artificers of walls, and artificers of
wood, to build to him a house.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> And David knoweth that Jehovah hath
established him for king over Israel, because of the lifting up on high
of his kingdom, for the sake of His people Israel.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> And David taketh again wives in
Jerusalem, and David begetteth again sons and daughters;

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> and these \[are\] the names of the
children whom he hath in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and
Solomon,

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> and Elishama, and Beeliada, and
Eliphalet.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> And the Philistines hear that David hath
been anointed for king over all Israel, and all the Philistines go up to
seek David, and David heareth, and goeth out before them.

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> And the Philistines have come, and rush
into the valley of Rephaim,

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> and David asketh of God, saying, \`Do I
go up against the Philistines -- and hast Thou given them into my hand?'
And Jehovah saith to him, \`Go up, and I have given them into thy hand.'

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> And they go up into Baal-Perazim, and
David smiteth them there, and David saith, \`God hath broken up mine
enemies by my hand, like the breaking up of waters;' therefore they have
called the name of that place Baal-Perazim.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> And they leave there their gods, and
David speaketh, and they are burnt with fire.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> And the Philistines add again, and rush
into the valley,

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> and David asketh again of God, and God
saith to him, \`Do not go up after them, turn round from them, and thou
hast come to them from over-against the mulberries;

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> and it cometh to pass, when thou
hearest the sound of the stepping at the heads of the mulberries, then
thou goest out into battle, for God hath gone out before thee to smite
the camp of the Philistines.'

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> And David doth as God commanded him,
and they smite the camp of the Philistines from Gibeon even unto Gazer;

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> and the name of David goeth out into
all the lands, and Jehovah hath put his fear on all the nations.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> And he maketh for himself houses in the
city of David, and prepareth a place for the ark of God, and stretcheth
out for it a tent.

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> Then said David, \`None \[are\] to carry
the ark of God, except the Levites, for on them hath Jehovah fixed to
carry the ark of God, and to serve Him -- unto the age.'

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> And David assembleth all Israel unto
Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Jehovah unto its place that he had
prepared for it.

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> And David gathereth the sons of Aaron,
and the Levites.

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> Of sons of Kohath: Uriel the chief, and
his brethren, a hundred and twenty.

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> Of sons of Merari: Asaiah the chief, and
his brethren, two hundred and twenty.

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> Of sons of Gershom: Joel the chief, and
his brethren, a hundred and thirty.

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> Of sons of Elizaphan: Shemaiah the chief,
and his brethren, two hundred.

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> Of sons of Hebron: Eliel the chief, and
his brethren, eighty.

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> Of sons of Uzziel: Amminadab the chief,
and his brethren, a hundred and twelve.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> And David calleth to Zadok and to
Abiathar the priests, and to the Levites, to Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel,
Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> and saith to them, \`Ye \[are\] heads
of the fathers of the Levites; sanctify yourselves, ye and your
brethren, and ye have brought up the ark of Jehovah, God of Israel, unto
\[the place\] I have prepared for it;

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> because at the first \[it was\] not ye,
Jehovah our God made a breach upon us, because we sought Him not
according to the ordinance.'

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> And the priests and the Levites
sanctify themselves, to bring up the ark of Jehovah, God of Israel;

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> and sons of the Levites bear the ark of
God, as Moses commanded, according to the word of Jehovah, on their
shoulder, with staves, above them.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> And David saith to the heads of the
Levites to appoint their brethren the singers, with instruments of song,
psalteries, and harps, and cymbals, sounding, to lift up with the voice
for joy.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> And the Levites appoint Heman son of
Joel, and of his brethren, Asaph son of Berechiah, and of the sons of
Merari their brethren, Ethan son of Kushaiah;

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> and with them their brethren, the
seconds \[in rank\], Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and
Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and
Elipheleh, and Mikneiah; and Obed-Edom and Jeiel the gatekeepers;

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> and the singers, Heman, Asaph, and
Ethan, with cymbals of brass to sound,

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> and Zechariah, and Aziel, and
Shemiramoth, and Jeheil, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah,
with psalteries besides virgins,

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and
Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps, on the
octave, to oversee.

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> And Chenaniah, head of the Levites,
\[is\] over the burden; he instructeth about the burden, for he \[is\]
intelligent.

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> And Berechiah and Elkanah \[are\]
gatekeepers for the ark.

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> And Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and
Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer the
priests, are blowing with trumpets before the ark of God; and Obed-Edom
and Jehiah \[are\] gatekeepers for the ark.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> And it is David, and the elders of
Israel, and the heads of the thousands, who are going to bring up the
ark of the covenant of Jehovah from the house of Obed-Edom with joy;

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> and it cometh to pass, in God's helping
the Levites bearing the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, that they
sacrifice seven bullocks and seven rams.

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> And David is wrapped in an upper robe
of fine linen, and all the Levites who are bearing the ark, and the
singers, and Chenaniah head of the burden of the singers; and on David
\[is\] an Ephod of linen.

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> And all Israel are bringing up the ark
of the covenant of Jehovah with shouting, and with the sound of a
cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding with psalteries
and harps,

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> and it cometh to pass, the ark of the
covenant of Jehovah is entering in unto the city of David, and Michal
daughter of Saul is looking through the window, and seeth king David
dancing and playing, and despiseth him in her heart.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> And they bring in the ark of God, and set
it up in the midst of the tent that David hath stretched out for it, and
they bring near burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God;

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> and David ceaseth from offering the
burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, and blesseth the people in the
name of Jehovah,

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> and giveth a portion to every man of
Israel, both man and woman: to each a cake of bread, and a measure of
wine, and a grape-cake.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> And he putteth before the ark of Jehovah,
of the Levites, ministers, even to make mention of, and to thank, and to
give praise to Jehovah, God of Israel,

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> Asaph the head, and his second Zechariah;
Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and
Benaiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, with instruments of psalteries, and
with harps; and Asaph with cymbals is sounding;

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests
\[are\] with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> On that day then hath David given at the
beginning to give thanks to Jehovah by the hand of Asaph and his
brethren: --

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> Give thanks to Jehovah, call in His name,
Make known among the peoples His doings.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> Sing ye to Him, sing psalms to Him,
Meditate on all His wonders.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> Boast yourselves in His holy name,
Rejoice doth the heart of those seeking Jehovah.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> Seek ye Jehovah and His strength, Seek
His face continually.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> Remember His wonders that He did, His
signs, and the judgments of His mouth,

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> O seed of Israel, His servant, O sons
of Jacob, His chosen ones!

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> He \[is\] Jehovah our God, In all the
earth \[are\] His judgments.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> Remember ye to the age His covenant,
The word He commanded -- To a thousand generations,

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> Which He hath made with Abraham, And
His oath -- to Isaac,

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> And He establisheth it to Jacob for a
statute, To Israel -- a covenant age-during.

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> Saying: To thee I give the land of
Canaan, The portion of your inheritance,

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> When ye are few of number, As a little
thing, and sojourners in it.

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> And they go up and down, From nation
unto nation, And from a kingdom unto another people.

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> He hath not suffered any to oppress
them, And reproveth on their account kings:

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> Come not against Mine anointed ones,
And against My prophets do not evil.

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> Sing to Jehovah, all the earth,
Proclaim from day unto day His salvation.

<span id="an_16:24">16:24</span> Rehearse among nations His glory, Among
all the peoples His wonders.

<span id="an_16:25">16:25</span> For great \[is\] Jehovah, and praised
greatly, And fearful He \[is\] above all gods.

<span id="an_16:26">16:26</span> For all gods of the peoples \[are\]
nought, And Jehovah the heavens hath made.

<span id="an_16:27">16:27</span> Honour and majesty \[are\] before Him,
Strength and joy \[are\] in His place.

<span id="an_16:28">16:28</span> Ascribe to Jehovah, ye families of
peoples, Ascribe to Jehovah honour and strength.

<span id="an_16:29">16:29</span> Ascribe to Jehovah the honour of His
name, Lift up a present, and come before Him. Bow yourselves to Jehovah,
In the beauty of holiness.

<span id="an_16:30">16:30</span> Be pained before Him, all the earth:

<span id="an_16:31">16:31</span> Also, established is the world, It is
not moved! The heavens rejoice, and the earth is glad, And they say
among nations: Jehovah hath reigned.

<span id="an_16:32">16:32</span> Roar doth the sea, and its fulness,
Exult doth the field, and all that \[is\] in it,

<span id="an_16:33">16:33</span> Then sing do trees of the forest, From
the presence of Jehovah, For He hath come to judge the earth!

<span id="an_16:34">16:34</span> Give thanks to Jehovah, for good, For
to the age, \[is\] His kindness,

<span id="an_16:35">16:35</span> And say, Save us, O God of our
salvation, And gather us, and deliver us from the nations, To give
thanks to Thy holy name, To triumph in Thy praise.

<span id="an_16:36">16:36</span> Blessed \[is\] Jehovah, God of Israel,
From the age and unto the age;' And all the people say, \`Amen,' and
have given praise to Jehovah.

<span id="an_16:37">16:37</span> And he leaveth there before the ark of
the covenant of Jehovah, for Asaph and for his brethren, to minister
before the ark continually, according to the matter of a day in its day,

<span id="an_16:38">16:38</span> both Obed-Edom and their brethren,
sixty and eight, and Obed-Edom son of Jeduthun, and Hosah for
gatekeepers,

<span id="an_16:39">16:39</span> and Zadok the priest, and his brethren
the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah, in a high place that
\[is\] in Gibeon,

<span id="an_16:40">16:40</span> to cause to ascend burnt-offerings to
Jehovah, on the altar of burnt-offering continually, morning and
evening, and for all that is written in the law of Jehovah, that He
charged on Israel.

<span id="an_16:41">16:41</span> And with them \[are\] Heman and
Jeduthun, and the rest of those chosen, who were defined by name, to
give thanks to Jehovah, for to the age \[is\] His kindness,

<span id="an_16:42">16:42</span> and with them -- Heman and Jeduthun --
\[are\] trumpets and cymbals for those sounding, and instruments of the
song of God, and the sons of Jeduthun \[are\] at the gate.

<span id="an_16:43">16:43</span> And all the people go, each to his
house, and David turneth round to bless his house.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> And it cometh to pass as David sat in his
house, that David saith unto Nathan the prophet, \`Lo, I am dwelling in
a house of cedars, and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah \[is\] under
curtains;'

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> and Nathan saith unto David, \`All that
\[is\] in thy heart do, for God \[is\] with thee.'

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> And it cometh to pass on that night that
a word of God is unto Nathan, saying,

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> \`Go, and thou hast said unto David My
servant, Thus said Jehovah, Thou dost not build for Me the house to
dwell in:

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> for I have not dwelt in a house from the
day that I brought up Israel till this day, and I am from tent unto
tent: and from the tabernacle,

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> whithersoever I have walked up and down
among all Israel, a word spake I, with one of the judges of Israel, whom
I commanded to feed My people, saying, Why have ye not built for Me a
house of cedars?

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> \`And now, thus dost thou say to My
servant, to David, Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, I have taken thee from
the habitation, from after the sheep, to be leader over My people
Israel,

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> and I am with thee whithersoever thou
hast walked, and I cut off all thine enemies from thy presence, and have
made for thee a name like the name of the great ones who \[are\] in the
earth.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> \`And I have prepared a place for My
people Israel, and planted it, and it hath dwelt in its place, and is
not troubled any more, and the sons of perverseness add not to wear it
out as at first,

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> yea, even from the days that I
appointed judges over My people Israel. \`And I have humbled all thine
enemies, and I declare to thee that a house doth Jehovah build for thee,

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> and it hath come to pass, when thy days
have been fulfilled to go with thy fathers, that I have raised up thy
seed after thee, who is of thy sons, and I have established his kingdom,

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> he doth build for Me a house, and I
have established his throne unto the age;

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> I am to him for a father, and he is to
Me for a son, and My kindness I turn not aside from him as I turned it
aside from him who was before thee,

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> and I have established him in My house,
and in My kingdom unto the age, and his throne is established unto the
age.'

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> According to all these words, and
according to all this vision, so spake Nathan unto David.

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> And David the king cometh in and
sitteth before Jehovah, and saith, \`Who \[am\] I, O Jehovah God, and
what my house, that Thou hast brought me hitherto?

<span id="an_17:17">17:17</span> And this is small in Thine eyes, O God,
and Thou speakest concerning the house of thy servant afar off, and hast
seen me as a type of the man who is on high, O Jehovah God!

<span id="an_17:18">17:18</span> \`What doth David add more unto Thee
for the honour of Thy servant; and Thou Thy servant hast known.

<span id="an_17:19">17:19</span> O Jehovah, for Thy servant's sake, and
according to Thine own heart Thou hast done all this greatness, to make
known all these great things.

<span id="an_17:20">17:20</span> O Jehovah, there is none like Thee, and
there is no god save Thee, according to all that we have heard with our
ears.

<span id="an_17:21">17:21</span> \`And who \[is\] as Thy people Israel,
one nation in the earth whom God hath gone to ransom to Him for a
people, to make for Thee a name great and fearful, to cast out from the
presence of Thy people whom Thou hast ransomed out of Egypt -- nations?

<span id="an_17:22">17:22</span> Yea, Thou dost appoint Thy people
Israel to Thee for a people unto the age, and Thou, O Jehovah, hast been
to them for God.

<span id="an_17:23">17:23</span> \`And now, O Jehovah, the word that
Thou hast spoken concerning Thy servant, and concerning his house, let
be stedfast unto the age, and do as Thou hast spoken;

<span id="an_17:24">17:24</span> and let it be stedfast, and Thy name is
great unto the age, saying, Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, is God to
Israel, and the house of Thy servant David is established before Thee;

<span id="an_17:25">17:25</span> for Thou, O my God, Thou hast uncovered
the ear of Thy servant -- to build to him a house, therefore hath Thy
servant found to pray before Thee.

<span id="an_17:26">17:26</span> \`And now, Jehovah, Thou \[art\] God
Himself, and Thou speakest concerning Thy servant this goodness;

<span id="an_17:27">17:27</span> and now, Thou hast been pleased to
bless the house of Thy servant, to be to the age before Thee; for Thou,
O Jehovah, hast blessed, and it is blessed to the age.'

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> And it cometh to pass after this, that
David smiteth the Philistines, and humbleth them, and taketh Gath and
its small towns out of the hand of the Philistines;

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> and he smiteth Moab, and the Moabites are
servants to David, bringing a present.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> And David smiteth Hadarezer king of
Zobah, at Hamath, in his going to establish his power by the river
Phrat,

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> and David captureth from him a thousand
chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen, and
David destroyeth utterly all the chariots, and leaveth of them a hundred
chariots \[only\].

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> And Aram of Damascus cometh in to give
help to Hadarezer king of Zobah, and David smiteth in Aram twenty and
two thousand men,

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> and David putteth \[garrisons\] in Aram
of Damascus, and the Aramaeans are to David for servants, bearing a
present, and Jehovah giveth salvation to David whithersoever he hath
gone.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> And David taketh the shields of gold that
have been on the servants of Hadarezer, and bringeth them in to
Jerusalem;

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> and from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities
of Hadarezer, hath David taken very much brass; with it hath Solomon
made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> And Tou king of Hamath heareth that David
hath smitten the whole force of Hadarezer king of Zobah,

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> and he sendeth Hadoram his son unto
king David, to ask of him of peace, and to bless him (because that he
hath fought against Hadarezer, and smiteth him, for a man of wars with
Tou had Hadarezer been,) and all kinds of vessels, of gold, and silver,
and brass;

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> also them hath king David sanctified to
Jehovah with the silver and the gold that he hath taken from all the
nations, from Edom, and from Moab, and from the sons of Ammon, and from
the Philistines, and from Amalek.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> And Abishai son of Zeruiah hath smitten
Edom in the valley of salt -- eighteen thousand,

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> and he putteth in Edom garrisons, and
all the Edomites are servants to David; and Jehovah saveth David
whithersoever he hath gone.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> And David reigneth over all Israel, and
he is doing judgment and righteousness to all his people,

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> and Joab son of Zeruiah \[is\] over the
host, and Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud \[is\] remembrancer,

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> and Zadok son of Ahitub, and Abimelech
son of Abiathar, \[are\] priests, and Shavsha \[is\] scribe,

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> and Benaiah son of Jehoiada \[is\] over
the Cherethite and the Pelethite, and the elder sons of David \[are\] at
the hand of the king.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> And it cometh to pass after this, that
Nahash king of the sons of Ammon dieth, and his son reigneth in his
stead,

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> and David saith, \`I do kindness with
Hanun son of Nahash, for his father did with me kindness;' and David
sendeth messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And the
servants of David come in unto the land of the sons of Ammon, unto
Hanun, to comfort him,

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> and the heads of the sons of Ammon say to
Hanun, \`Is David honouring thy father, in thine eyes, because he hath
sent to thee comforters? in order to search, and to overthrow, and to
spy out, the land, have not his servants come in unto thee?'

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> And Hanun taketh the servants of David,
and shaveth them, and cutteth their long robes in the midst, unto the
buttocks, and sendeth them away.

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> And \[some\] go, and declare to David
concerning the men, and he sendeth to meet them -- for the men have been
greatly ashamed -- and the king saith, \`Dwell in Jericho till that your
beard is grown, then ye have returned.'

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> And the sons of Ammon see that they have
made themselves abhorred by David, and Hanun and the sons of Ammon send
a thousand talents of silver, to hire to them, from Aram-Naharaim, and
from Aram-Maachah, and from Zobah, chariots and horsemen;

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> and they hire to them two and thirty
thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people, and they come
in and encamp before Medeba, and the sons of Ammon have been gathered
out of their cities, and come in to the battle.

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> And David heareth, and sendeth Joab, and
all the host of the mighty men,

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> and the sons of Ammon come out and set
battle in array at the opening of the city, and the kings who have come
\[are\] by themselves in the field.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> And Joab seeth that the front of the
battle hath been unto him, before and behind, and he chooseth out of all
the choice in Israel, and setteth in array to meet Aram,

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> and the remnant of the people he hath
given into the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set in array to
meet the sons of Ammon.

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> And he saith, \`If Aram be stronger
than I, then thou hast been to me for salvation; and if the sons of
Ammon be stronger than thou, then I have saved thee;

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> be strong, and we strengthen ourselves,
for our people, and for the cities of our God, and Jehovah doth that
which is good in His eyes.'

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> And Joab draweth nigh, and the people
who \[are\] with him, before Aram to battle, and they flee from his
face;

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> and the sons of Ammon have seen that
Aram hath fled, and they flee -- they also -- from the face of Abishai
his brother, and go in to the city. And Joab cometh in to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> And Aram seeth that they have been
smitten before Israel, and send messengers, and bring out Aram that
\[is\] beyond the River, and Shophach head of the host of Hadarezer
\[is\] before them.

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> And it is declared to David, and he
gathereth all Israel, and passeth over the Jordan, and cometh in unto
them, and setteth in array against them; yea, David setteth in array the
battle to meet Aram, and they fight with him;

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> and Aram fleeth from the face of
Israel, and David slayeth of Aram seven thousand charioteers, and forty
thousand footmen, and Shophach head of the host he hath put to death.

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> And the servants of Hadarezer see that
they have been smitten before Israel, and they make peace with David and
serve him, and Aram hath not been willing to help the sons of Ammon any
more.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> And it cometh to pass, at the time of the
turn of the year -- at the time of the going out of the messengers --
that Joab leadeth out the force of the host, and destroyeth the land of
the sons of Ammon, and cometh in and beseigeth Rabbah -- David is
abiding in Jerusalem -- and Joab smiteth Rabbah, and breaketh it down.

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> And David taketh the crown of their king
from off his head, and findeth it \[in\] weight a talent of gold, and in
it a precious stone, and it is on the head of David: and spoil of the
city he hath brought out very much,

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> and the people who \[are\] in it he hath
brought out, and setteth to the saw, and to cutting instruments of iron,
and to axes; and thus doth David to all cities of the sons of Ammon, and
David turneth back, and all the people, to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> And it cometh to pass, after this, that
there remaineth war in Gezer with the Philistines, then hath Sibbechai
the Hushathite smitten Sippai, of the children of the giant, and they
are humbled.

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> And there is again war with the
Philistines, and Elhanan son of Jair smiteth Lahmi, brother of Goliath
the Gittite, the wood of whose spear \[is\] like a beam of weavers.

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> And there is again war in Gath, and there
is a man of measure, and his fingers and his toes \[are\] six and six,
twenty and four, and also, he hath been born to the giant.

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> And he reproacheth Israel, and smite him
doth Jonathan son of Shimea, brother of David.

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> These were born to the giant in Gath, and
they fall by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> And there standeth up an adversary
against Israel, and persuadeth David to number Israel,

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> And David saith unto Joab, and unto the
heads of the people, \`Go, number Israel from Beer-Sheba even unto Dan,
and bring unto me, and I know their number.'

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> And Joab saith, \`Jehovah doth add to His
people as they are a hundred times; are they not, my lord, O king, all
of them to my lord for servants? why doth my lord seek this? why is he
for a cause of guilt to Israel?'

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> And the word of the king \[is\] severe
against Joab, and Joab goeth out, and goeth up and down in all Israel,
and cometh in to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> And Joab giveth the account of the
numbering of the people unto David, and all Israel is a thousand
thousand and a hundred thousand, each drawing sword, and Judah \[is\]
four hundred and seventy thousand, each drawing sword.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> And Levi and Benjamin he hath not
numbered in their midst, for the word of the king was abominable with
Joab.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> And it is evil in the eyes of God
concerning this thing, and He smiteth Israel,

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> and David saith unto God, \`I have sinned
exceedingly, in that I have done this thing; and now, cause to pass
away, I pray Thee, the iniquity of Thy servant, for I have acted very
foolishly.'

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> And Jehovah speaketh unto Gad, seer of
David, saying:

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> \`Go, and thou hast spoken unto David,
saying, Thus said Jehovah, Three -- I am stretching out unto thee;
choose for thee one of these, and I do \[it\] to thee.'

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> And Gad cometh in unto David, and saith
to him, \`Thus said Jehovah, Take for thee --

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> either for three years -- famine, or
three months to be consumed from the face of thine adversaries, even the
sword of thine enemies to overtake, or three days the sword of Jehovah,
even pestilence in the land, and a messenger of Jehovah destroying in
all the border of Israel; and now, see; what word do I return to Him who
is sending me?'

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> And David saith unto Gad, \`I am
greatly distressed, let me fall, I pray thee, into the hand of Jehovah,
for very many \[are\] His mercies, and into the hand of man let me not
fall.'

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> And Jehovah giveth a pestilence in
Israel, and there fall of Israel seventy thousand men,

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> and God sendeth a messenger to
Jerusalem to destroy it, and as he is destroying Jehovah hath seen, and
is comforted concerning the evil, and saith to the messenger who \[is\]
destroying, \`Enough, now, cease thy hand.' And the messenger of Jehovah
is standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite,

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> and David lifteth up his eyes, and
seeth the messenger of Jehovah standing between the earth and the
heavens, and his sword drawn in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem,
and David falleth, and the elders, covered with sackcloth, on their
faces.

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> And David saith unto God, \`Did not I
-- I say to number the people? Yea, I it \[is\] who have sinned, and
done great evil: and these, the flock, what did they? O Jehovah, my God,
let, I pray Thee, Thy hand be on me, and on the house of my father, and
not on Thy people -- to be plagued.'

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> And the messenger of Jehovah spake unto
Gad, saying for David, \`Surely David doth go up to raise an altar to
Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.'

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> And David goeth up by the word of Gad,
that he spake in the name of Jehovah.

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> And Ornan turneth back, and seeth the
messenger, and his four sons \[are\] with him, hiding themselves, and
Ornan is threshing wheat.

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> And David cometh in unto Ornan, and
Ornan looketh attentively, and seeth David, and goeth out from the
threshing-floor, and boweth himself to David -- face to the earth.

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> And David saith unto Ornan, \`Give to
me the place of the threshing-floor, and I build in it an altar to
Jehovah; for full silver give it to me, and the plague is restrained
from the people.'

<span id="an_21:23">21:23</span> And Ornan saith unto David, \`Take to
thee -- and my lord the king doth that which is good in his eyes: see, I
have given the oxen for burnt-offerings, and the threshing instruments
for wood, and the wheat for a present; the whole I have given.'

<span id="an_21:24">21:24</span> And king David saith to Ornan, \`Nay,
for I surely buy for full silver; for I do not lift up that which is
thine to Jehovah, so as to offer a burnt-offering without cost.'

<span id="an_21:25">21:25</span> And David giveth to Ornan for the place
shekels of gold \[in\] weight six hundred;

<span id="an_21:26">21:26</span> and David buildeth there an altar to
Jehovah, and offereth burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and calleth
unto Jehovah, and He answereth him with fire from the heavens on the
altar of the burnt-offering.

<span id="an_21:27">21:27</span> And Jehovah saith to the messenger, and
he turneth back his sword unto its sheath.

<span id="an_21:28">21:28</span> At that time when David seeth that
Jehovah hath answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite,
then he sacrificeth there;

<span id="an_21:29">21:29</span> and the tabernacle of Jehovah that
Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt-offering,
\[are\] at that time in a high place, in Gibeon;

<span id="an_21:30">21:30</span> and David is not able to go before it
to seek God, for he hath been afraid because of the sword of the
messenger of Jehovah.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> And David saith, \`This is the house of
Jehovah God, and this the altar for burnt-offering for Israel.'

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> And David saith to gather the sojourners
who \[are\] in the land of Israel, and appointeth hewers to hew
hewn-stones to build a house of God.

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> And iron in abundance for nails for
leaves of the gates, and for couplings, hath David prepared, and brass
in abundance -- there is no weighing.

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> And cedar-trees even without number, for
the Zidonians and the Tyrians brought in cedar-trees in abundance to
David.

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> And David saith, \`Solomon my son \[is\]
a youth and tender, and the house to be built to Jehovah \[is\] to be
made exceedingly great, for name and for beauty to all the lands; let me
prepare, I pray Thee, for it;' and David prepareth in abundance before
his death.

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> And he calleth for Solomon his son, and
chargeth him to build a house to Jehovah, God of Israel,

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> and David saith to Solomon his son, \`As
for me, it hath been with my heart to build a house to the name of
Jehovah my God,

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> and the word of Jehovah \[is\] against
me, saying, Blood in abundance thou hast shed, and great wars thou hast
made: thou dost not build a house to My name, for much blood thou hast
shed to the earth before Me.

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> \`Lo, a son is born to thee; he is a man
of rest, and I have given rest to him from all his enemies round about,
for Solomon is his name, and peace and quietness I give unto Israel in
his days;

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> he doth build a house to My name, and
he is to Me for a son, and I \[am\] to him for a father, and I have
established the throne of his kingdom over Israel unto the age.

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> \`Now, my son, Jehovah is with thee,
and thou hast prospered, and hast built the house of Jehovah thy God, as
He spake concerning thee.

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> Only, Jehovah give to thee wisdom and
understanding, and charge thee concerning Israel, even to keep the law
of Jehovah thy God;

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> then thou dost prosper, if thou dost
observe to do the statutes and the judgments that Jehovah charged Moses
with concerning Israel; be strong and courageous; do not fear, nor be
cast down.

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> \`And lo, in mine affliction, I have
prepared for the house of Jehovah of gold talents a hundred thousand,
and of silver a thousand thousand talents; and of brass and of iron
there is no weighing, for in abundance it hath been, and wood and stones
I have prepared, and to them thou dost add.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> \`And with thee in abundance \[are\]
workmen, hewers and artificers of stone and of wood, and every skilful
man for every work.

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> To the gold, to the silver, and to the
brass, and to the iron, there is no number; arise and do, and Jehovah is
with thee.'

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> And David giveth charge to all heads of
Israel to give help to Solomon his son,

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> \`Is not Jehovah your God with you?
yea, He hath given rest to you round about, for He hath given into my
hand the inhabitants of the land, and subdued hath been the land before
His people.

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> \`Now, give your heart and your soul to
seek to Jehovah your God, and rise and build the sanctuary of Jehovah
God, to bring in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and the holy
vessels of God, to the house that is built to the name of Jehovah.'

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> And David is old, and satisfied with
days, and causeth his son Solomon to reign over Israel,

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> and gathereth all the heads of Israel,
and the priests, and the Levites;

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> and the Levites are numbered from a son
of thirty years and upward, and their number, by their polls, is of
mighty men thirty and eight thousand.

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> Of these to preside over the work of the
house of Jehovah \[are\] twenty and four thousand, and officers and
judges six thousand,

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> and four thousand gatekeepers, and four
thousand giving praise to Jehovah, \`with instruments that I made for
praising,' \[saith David.\]

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> And David distributeth them into courses:
Of the sons of Levi: of Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

<span id="an_23:7">23:7</span> Of the Gershonite: Laadan and Shimei.

<span id="an_23:8">23:8</span> Sons of Laadan: the head \[is\] Jehiel,
and Zetham, and Joel, three.

<span id="an_23:9">23:9</span> Sons of Shimei \[are\] Shelomith, and
Haziel, and Haran, three; these \[are\] heads of the fathers of Laadan.

<span id="an_23:10">23:10</span> And sons of Shimei \[are\] Jahath,
Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah; these \[are\] sons of Shimei, four.

<span id="an_23:11">23:11</span> And Jahath is the head, and Zizah the
second, and Jeush and Beriah have not multiplied sons, and they become
the house of a father by one numbering.

<span id="an_23:12">23:12</span> Sons of Kohath \[are\] Amram, Izhar,
Hebron, and Uzziel, four.

<span id="an_23:13">23:13</span> Sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and
Aaron is separated for his sanctifying the holy of holies, he and his
sons -- unto the age, to make perfume before Jehovah, to serve Him, and
to bless in His name -- unto the age.

<span id="an_23:14">23:14</span> As to Moses, the man of God, his sons
are called after the tribe of Levi.

<span id="an_23:15">23:15</span> Sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.

<span id="an_23:16">23:16</span> Sons of Gershom: Shebuel the head.

<span id="an_23:17">23:17</span> And sons of Eliezer are Rehabiah the
head, and Eliezer had no other sons, and the sons of Rehabiah have
multiplied exceedingly.

to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and for
the footstool of our God, and I prepared to build,

<span id="an_28:3">28:3</span> and God hath said to me, Thou dost not
build a house to My name, for a man of wars thou \[art\], and blood thou
hast shed.

<span id="an_28:4">28:4</span> \`And Jehovah, God of Israel, doth fix on
me out of all the house of my father to be for king over Israel to the
age, for on Judah He hath fixed for a leader, and in the house of Judah,
the house of my father, and among the sons of my father, on me, \[me\]
He hath been pleased to make king over all Israel;

<span id="an_28:5">28:5</span> and out of all my sons -- for many sons
hath Jehovah given to me -- He also fixeth on Solomon my son, to sit on
the throne of the kingdom of Jehovah over Israel,

<span id="an_28:6">28:6</span> and saith to me, Solomon thy son, he doth
build My house, and My courts, for I have fixed on him to Me for a son,
and I -- I am to him for a father,

<span id="an_28:7">28:7</span> and I have established his kingdom to the
age, if he is strong to do My commands, and My judgments, as at this
day.

<span id="an_28:8">28:8</span> \`And now, before the eyes of all Israel,
the assembly of Jehovah, and in the ears of our God, keep and seek all
the commands of Jehovah your God, so that ye possess this good land, and
have caused your sons to inherit after you unto the age.

<span id="an_28:9">28:9</span> \`And thou, Solomon, my son, know the God
of thy father, and serve Him with a perfect heart, and with a willing
mind, for all hearts is Jehovah seeking, and every imagination of the
thoughts He is understanding; if thou dost seek Him, He is found of
thee, and if thou dost forsake Him, He casteth thee off for ever.

<span id="an_28:10">28:10</span> See, now, for Jehovah hath fixed on
thee to build a house for a sanctuary; be strong, and do.'

<span id="an_28:11">28:11</span> And David giveth to Solomon his son the
pattern of the porch, and of its houses, and of its treasures, and of
its upper chambers, and of its innermost chambers, and of the house of
the atonement;

<span id="an_28:12">28:12</span> and the pattern of all that hath been
by the Spirit with him, for the courts of the house of Jehovah, and for
all the chambers round about, for the treasures of the house of God, and
for the treasures of the things sacrificed;

<span id="an_28:13">28:13</span> and for the courses of the priests and
of the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of
Jehovah, and for all vessels of service of the house of Jehovah,

<span id="an_28:14">28:14</span> even gold by weight, for \[things of\]
gold, for all instruments of service and service; for all instruments of
silver by weight, for all instruments of service and service;

<span id="an_28:15">28:15</span> and \[by\] weight for the candlesticks
of gold, and their lamps of gold, by weight \[for\] candlestick and
candlestick, and its lamps; and for the candlesticks of silver, by
weight for a candlestick and its lamps, according to the service of
candlestick and candlestick;

<span id="an_28:16">28:16</span> and the gold \[by\] weight for tables
of the arrangement, for table and table, and silver for the tables of
silver;

<span id="an_28:17">28:17</span> and the forks, and the bowls, and the
cups of pure gold, and for the basins of gold, by weight for basin and
basin, and for the basins of silver, by weight for basin and basin,

<span id="an_28:18">28:18</span> and for the altar of perfume refined
gold by weight, and for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubs of
gold -- spreading and covering over the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.

<span id="an_28:19">28:19</span> The whole \[is\] in writing from the
hand of Jehovah, \`He caused me to understand all the work of the
pattern,' \[said David.\]

<span id="an_28:20">28:20</span> And David saith to Solomon his son,
\`Be strong, and courageous, and do; do not fear nor be affrighted, for
Jehovah God, my God, \[is\] with thee; He doth not fail thee, nor
forsake thee, unto the completion of all the work of the service of the
house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_28:21">28:21</span> \`And lo, courses of the priests and of
the Levites \[are\] for all the service of the house of God; and with
thee in all work \[is\] every willing one with wisdom, for every
service; and the heads and all the people \[are\] according to all thy
words.'

<span id="an_29:1">29:1</span> And David the king saith to all the
assembly, \`Solomon my son -- the one on whom God hath fixed -- \[is\]
young and tender, and the work \[is\] great, for not for man is the
palace, but for Jehovah God;

<span id="an_29:2">29:2</span> and with all my power I have prepared for
the house of my God, the gold for \[things of\] gold, and the silver for
\[those of\] silver, and the brass for \[those of\] brass, the iron for
\[those of\] iron, and the wood for \[those of\] wood, shoham stones,
and settings, and stones of painting and of diverse colours, and all
\[kinds of\] precious stone, and stones of white marble, in abundance.

<span id="an_29:3">29:3</span> \`And again, because of my delighting in
the house of my God, the substance I have -- a peculiar treasure of gold
and silver -- I have given for the house of my God, even over and above
all I have prepared for the house of the sanctuary:

<span id="an_29:4">29:4</span> three thousand talents of gold, of the
gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay
the walls of the houses,

<span id="an_29:5">29:5</span> even gold for \[things of\] gold, and
silver for \[those of\] silver, and for all the work by the hand of
artificers; and who \[is\] he that is offering willingly to consecrate
his hand to-day to Jehovah?'

<span id="an_29:6">29:6</span> And the heads of the fathers, and the
heads of the tribes of Israel, and the heads of the thousands, and of
the hundreds, even to the heads of the work of the king, offer
willingly.

<span id="an_29:7">29:7</span> And they give for the service of the
house of God, of gold -- talents five thousand, and drams a myriad; and
of silver -- talents ten thousand, and of brass -- a myriad and eight
thousand talents; and of iron -- a hundred thousand talents;

<span id="an_29:8">29:8</span> and he with whom stones are found hath
given to the treasury of the house of Jehovah, by the hand of Jehiel the
Gershonite.

<span id="an_29:9">29:9</span> And the people rejoice because of their
offering willingly, for with a perfect heart they have offered willingly
to Jehovah; and also David the king hath rejoiced -- great joy.

<span id="an_29:10">29:10</span> And David blesseth Jehovah before the
eyes of all the assembly, and David saith, \`Blessed \[art\] Thou,
Jehovah, God of Israel our father, from age even unto age.

<span id="an_29:11">29:11</span> To Thee, O Jehovah, \[is\] the
greatness, and the might, and the beauty, and the victory, and the
honour, because of all in the heavens and in the earth; to Thee, O
Jehovah, \[is\] the kingdom, and he who is lifting up himself over all
for head;

<span id="an_29:12">29:12</span> and the riches, and the honour \[are\]
from before Thee, and Thou art ruling over all, and in Thy hand \[is\]
power and might, and in Thy hand, to make great, and to give strength to
all.

<span id="an_29:13">29:13</span> \`And now, our God, we are giving
thanks to Thee, and giving praise to Thy beauteous name;

<span id="an_29:14">29:14</span> yea, because, who \[am\] I, and who
\[are\] my people, that we retain power to offer thus willingly? but of
Thee \[is\] the whole, and out of Thy hand we have given to Thee;

<span id="an_29:15">29:15</span> for sojourners we \[are\] before Thee,
and settlers, like all our fathers; as a shadow \[are\] our days on the
land, and there is none abiding.

<span id="an_29:16">29:16</span> \`O Jehovah our God, all this store
that we have prepared to build to Thee a house, for Thy holy name,
\[is\] out of Thy hand, and of Thee \[is\] the whole.

<span id="an_29:17">29:17</span> \`And I have known, my God, that Thou
art trying the heart, and uprightness dost desire; I, in the uprightness
of my heart, have willingly offered all these: and now, Thy people who
are found here I have seen with joy to offer willingly to Thee.

<span id="an_29:18">29:18</span> \`O Jehovah, God of Abraham, Isaac, and
Israel, our fathers, keep this to the age for the imagination of the
thoughts of the heart of Thy people, and prepare their heart unto Thee;

<span id="an_29:19">29:19</span> and to Solomon my son give a perfect
heart, to keep Thy commands, Thy testimonies, and Thy statutes, and to
do the whole, even to build the palace \[for\] which I have prepared.'

<span id="an_29:20">29:20</span> And David saith to all the assembly,
\`Bless, I pray you, Jehovah your God;' and all the assembly bless
Jehovah, God of their fathers, and bow and do obeisance to Jehovah, and
to the king.

<span id="an_29:21">29:21</span> And they sacrifice to Jehovah
sacrifices, and cause to ascend burnt-offerings to Jehovah on the morrow
of that day, bullocks a thousand, rams a thousand, lambs a thousand, and
their oblations, even sacrifices in abundance, for all Israel.

<span id="an_29:22">29:22</span> And they eat and drink before Jehovah
on that day with great joy, and cause Solomon son of David to reign a
second time, and anoint \[him\] before Jehovah for leader, and Zadok for
priest.

<span id="an_29:23">29:23</span> And Solomon sitteth on the throne of
Jehovah for king instead of David his father, and prospereth, and all
Israel hearken unto him,

<span id="an_29:24">29:24</span> and all the heads, and the mighty men,
and also all the sons of king David have given a hand under Solomon the
king;

<span id="an_29:25">29:25</span> and Jehovah maketh Solomon exceedingly
great before the eyes of all Israel, and putteth upon him the honour of
the kingdom that hath not been on any king over Israel before him.

<span id="an_29:26">29:26</span> And David son of Jesse hath reigned
over all Israel,

<span id="an_29:27">29:27</span> and the days that he hath reigned over
Israel \[are\] forty years; in Hebron he reigned seven years, and in
Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three;

<span id="an_29:28">29:28</span> and he dieth in a good old age,
satisfied with days, riches, and honour, and reign doth Solomon his son
in his stead.

<span id="an_29:29">29:29</span> And the matters of David the king, the
first and the last, lo, they are written beside the matters of Samuel
the seer, and beside the matters of Nathan the prophet, and beside the
matters of Gad the seer,

<span id="an_29:30">29:30</span> with all his reign, and his might, and
the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all kingdoms of
the lands.
