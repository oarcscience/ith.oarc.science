### Young's Literal Translation: Zephaniah

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> A word of Jehovah that hath been unto
Zephaniah son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of
Hezikiah, in the days of Josiah son of Amoz, king of Judah:

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> I utterly consume all from off the face of
the ground, An affirmation of Jehovah.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> I consume man and beast, I consume fowl of
the heavens, and fishes of the sea, And the stumbling-blocks -- the
wicked, And I have cut off man from the face of the ground, An
affirmation of Jehovah,

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> And stretched out My hand against Judah,
And against all inhabiting Jerusalem, And cut off from this place the
remnant of Baal, The name of the idolatrous priests, with the priests,

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And those bowing themselves On the roofs to
the host of the heavens, And those bowing themselves, Swearing to
Jehovah, and swearing by Malcham,

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And those removing from after Jehovah, And
who have not sought Jehovah, nor besought Him.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> Hush! because of the Lord Jehovah, For near
\[is\] a day of Jehovah, For prepared hath Jehovah a sacrifice, He hath
sanctified His invited ones.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> And it hath come to pass, In the day of the
sacrifice of Jehovah, That I have laid a charge on the heads, And on
sons of the king, And on all putting on strange clothing.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> And I have laid a charge on every one Who
is leaping over the threshold in that day, Who are filling the house of
their masters \[With\] violence and deceit.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> And there hath been in that day, An
affirmation of Jehovah, The noise of a cry from the fish-gate, And of a
howling from the Second, And of great destruction from the hills.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Howl, ye inhabitants of the hollow place,
For cut off hath been all the merchant people, Cut off have been all
bearing silver.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> And it hath come to pass, at that time, I
search Jerusalem with lights, And I have laid a charge on the men Who
are hardened on their preserved things, Who are saying in their heart:
Jehovah doth no good, nor doth He evil.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> And their wealth hath been for a spoil,
And their houses for desolation, And they have built houses, and do not
inhabit, And they have planted vineyards, And they do not drink their
wine.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> Near \[is\] the great day of Jehovah,
Near, and hasting exceedingly, The noise of the day of Jehovah, Bitterly
shriek there doth a mighty one.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> A day of wrath \[is\] that day, A day of
adversity and distress, A day of waste and desolation, A day of darkness
and gloominess, A day of cloud and thick darkness.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> A day of trumpet and shouting against the
fenced cities, And against the high corners.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> And I have sent distress to men, And they
have walked as the blind, For against Jehovah they have sinned, And
poured out is their blood as dust, And their flesh \[is\] as dung.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> Even their silver, even their gold, Is
not able to deliver them in a day of the wrath of Jehovah, And in the
fire of His jealousy consumed is the whole land, For only a hastened end
doth He make Of all the inhabitants of the land!

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Bend yourselves, yea, bend ye, O nation not
desired,

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> Before the bringing forth of a statute, As
chaff hath the day passed on, While yet not come in upon you doth the
heat of the anger of Jehovah, While yet not come in upon you doth a day
of the anger of Jehovah,

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> Seek Jehovah, all ye humble of the land,
Who His judgment have done, Seek ye righteousness, seek humility, It may
be ye are hidden in a day of the anger of Jehovah.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> For Gaza is forsaken, And Ashkelon \[is\]
for a desolation, Ashdod! at noon they do cast her forth, And Ekron is
rooted up.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Ho! O inhabitants of the sea-coast, Nation
of the Cherethites, A word of Jehovah \[is\] against you, Canaan, land
of the Philistines, And I have destroyed thee without an inhabitant.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> And the sea-coast hath been habitations,
Cottages \[for\] shepherds, and folds \[for\] a flock.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> And the coast hath been for the remnant of
the house of Judah, By them they have pleasure, In houses of Ashkelon at
even they lie down, For inspect them doth Jehovah their God, And He hath
turned back \[to\] their captivity.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> I have heard the reproach of Moab, And the
revilings of the sons of Ammon, Wherewith they reproached My people, And
magnify \[themselves\] against their border.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> Therefore, I live, An affirmation of
Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, Surely, Moab is as Sodom, And the sons
of Ammon as Gomorrah, An overrunning of nettles and salt-pits, And a
desolation -- unto the age. A residue of My people do seize them, And a
remnant of My nation inherit them.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> This \[is\] to them for their arrogancy,
Because they have reproached, And they magnify \[themselves\] against
the people of Jehovah of Hosts.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> Fearful \[is\] Jehovah against them, For
He made bare all gods of the land, And bow themselves to Him, each from
his place, Do all islanders of the nations.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> Also ye, O Cushim, pierced of My sword
\[are\] they.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And He stretcheth His hand against the
north, And doth destroy Asshur, And he setteth Nineveh for a desolation,
A dry land like a wilderness.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> And crouched in her midst have droves,
Every beast of the nation, Both pelican and hedge-hog in her knobs
lodge, A voice doth sing at the window, \`Destruction \[is\] at the
threshold, For the cedar-work is exposed.'

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> This \[is\] the exulting city that is
dwelling confidently, That is saying in her heart, \`I \[am\], and
beside me there is none,' How hath she been for a desolation, A
crouching-place for beasts, Every one passing by her doth hiss, He doth
shake his hand!

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Wo \[to\] the rebellious and polluted, The
oppressing city!

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> She hath not hearkened to the voice, She
hath not accepted instruction, In Jehovah she hath not trusted, Unto her
God she hath not drawn near.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> Her heads in her midst \[are\] roaring
lions, Her judges \[are\] evening wolves, They have not gnawn the bone
in the morning.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> Her prophets unstable -- men of treachery,
Her priests have polluted the sanctuary, They have violated the law.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Jehovah \[is\] righteous in her midst, He
doth not do perverseness, Morning by morning His judgment he giveth to
the light, It hath not been lacking, And the perverse doth not know
shame.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> I have cut off nations, Desolated have been
their chief ones, I have laid waste their out-places without any passing
by, Destroyed have been their cities, Without man, without inhabitant.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> I have said: Only, ye do fear Me, Ye do
accept instruction, And her habitation is not cut off, All that I have
appointed for her, But they have risen early, They have corrupted all
their doings.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Therefore, wait for Me -- an affirmation of
Jehovah, For the day of My rising for prey, For My judgment \[is\] to
gather nations, To assemble kingdoms, To pour out on them Mine
indignation, All the heat of Mine anger, For by the fire of My jealousy
consumed is all the earth.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> For then do I turn unto peoples a pure lip,
To call all of them by the name of Jehovah, To serve Him \[with\] one
shoulder.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> From beyond the rivers of Cush, my
supplicants, The daughter of My scattered ones, Do bring My present.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> In that day thou art not ashamed because
of any of thine actions, Wherewith thou hast transgressed against Me,
For then do I turn aside from thy midst The exulting ones of thine
excellency, And thou dost add no more to be haughty, In My holy
mountain.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> And I have left in thy midst a people
humble and poor, And they have trusted in the name of Jehovah.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> The remnant of Israel do no perversity,
nor speak lies, Nor found in their mouth is a deceitful tongue, For they
have delight, and have lain down, And there is none troubling.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> Cry aloud, O daughter of Zion, shout, O
Israel, Rejoice and exult with the whole heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> Jehovah hath turned aside thy judgments,
He hath faced thine enemy, The king of Israel, Jehovah, \[is\] in thy
midst, Thou seest evil no more.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> In that day it is said to Jerusalem,
\`Fear not, O Zion, let not thy hands be feeble.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> Jehovah thy God \[is\] in thy midst, A
mighty one doth save, He rejoiceth over thee with joy, He doth work in
His love, He joyeth over thee with singing.'

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> Mine afflicted from the appointed place I
have gathered, from thee they have been, Bearing for her sake reproach.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> Lo, I am dealing with all afflicting thee
at that time, And I have saved the halting one, And the driven out ones
I do gather, And have set them for a praise and for a name, In all the
land of their shame.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> At that time I bring you in, Even at the
time of My assembling you, For I give you for a name, and for a praise,
Among all peoples of the land, In My turning back \[to\] your captivity
before your eyes, said Jehovah!
