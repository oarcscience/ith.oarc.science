### Young's Literal Translation: 1 Thessalonians

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the
assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ:
Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> We give thanks to God always for you all,
making mention of you in our prayers,

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> unceasingly remembering of you the work of
the faith, and the labour of the love, and the endurance of the hope, of
our Lord Jesus Christ, in the presence of our God and Father,

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> having known, brethren beloved, by God,
your election,

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> because our good news did not come to you
in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much
assurance, even as ye have known of what sort we became among you
because of you,

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> and ye -- ye did become imitators of us,
and of the Lord, having received the word in much tribulation, with joy
of the Holy Spirit,

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> so that ye became patterns to all those
believing in Macedonia and Achaia,

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> for from you hath sounded forth the word of
the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your
faith toward God did go forth, so that we have no need to say anything,

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> for they themselves concerning us do
declare what entrance we had unto you, and how ye did turn unto God from
the idols, to serve a living and true God,

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> and to wait for His Son from the heavens,
whom He did raise out of the dead -- Jesus, who is rescuing us from the
anger that is coming.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> For yourselves have known, brethren, our
entrance in unto you, that it did not become vain,

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> but having both suffered before, and having
been injuriously treated (as ye have known) in Philippi, we were bold in
our God to speak unto you the good news of God in much conflict,

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> for our exhortation \[is\] not out of
deceit, nor out of uncleanness, nor in guile,

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> but as we have been approved by God to be
entrusted with the good news, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God,
who is proving our hearts,

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> for at no time did we come with speech of
flattery, (as ye have known,) nor in a pretext for covetousness, (God
\[is\] witness!)

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> nor seeking of men glory, neither from you
nor from others, being able to be burdensome, as Christ's apostles.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> But we became gentle in your midst, as a
nurse may cherish her own children,

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> so being desirous of you, we are
well-pleased to impart to you not only the good news of God, but also
our own souls, because beloved ye have become to us,

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> for ye remember, brethren, our labour and
travail, for, night and day working not to be a burden upon any of you,
we did preach to you the good news of God;

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> ye \[are\] witnesses -- God also -- how
kindly and righteously, and blamelessly to you who believe we became,

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> even as ye have known, how each one of
you, as a father his own children, we are exhorting you, and comforting,
and testifying,

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> for your walking worthily of God, who is
calling you to His own reign and glory.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> Because of this also, we -- we do give
thanks to God continually, that, having received the word of hearing
from us of God, ye accepted, not the word of man, but as it is truly,
the word of God, who also doth work in you who believe;

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> for ye became imitators, brethren, of the
assemblies of God that are in Judea in Christ Jesus, because such things
ye suffered, even ye, from your own countrymen, as also they from the
Jews,

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> who did both put to death the Lord Jesus
and their own prophets, and did persecute us, and God they are not
pleasing, and to all men \[are\] contrary,

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> forbidding us to speak to the nations
that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always, but the anger
did come upon them -- to the end!

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> And we, brethren, having been taken from
you for the space of an hour -- in presence, not in heart -- did hasten
the more abundantly to see your face in much desire,

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> wherefore we wished to come unto you, (I
indeed Paul,) both once and again, and the Adversary did hinder us;

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> for what \[is\] our hope, or joy, or
crown of rejoicing? are not even ye before our Lord Jesus Christ in his
presence?

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> for ye are our glory and joy.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Wherefore no longer forbearing, we thought
good to be left in Athens alone,

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> and did send Timotheus -- our brother, and
a ministrant of God, and our fellow-workman in the good news of the
Christ -- to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith,

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> that no one be moved in these tribulations,
for yourselves have known that for this we are set,

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> for even when we were with you, we said to
you beforehand, that we are about to suffer tribulation, as also it did
come to pass, and ye have known \[it\];

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> because of this also, I, no longer
forbearing, did send to know your faith, lest he who is tempting did
tempt you, and in vain might be our labour.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> And now Timotheus having come unto us from
you, and having declared good news to us of your faith and love, and
that ye have a good remembrance of us always, desiring much to see us,
as we also \[to see\] you,

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> because of this we were comforted,
brethren, over you, in all our tribulation and necessity, through your
faith,

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> because now we live, if ye may stand fast
in the Lord;

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> for what thanks are we able to recompense
to God for you, for all the joy with which we do joy because of you in
the presence of our God?

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> night and day exceedingly beseeching,
that we might see your face, and perfect the things lacking in your
faith.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> And our God and Father Himself, and our
Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you,

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> and you the Lord cause to increase and to
abound in the love to one another, and to all, even as we also to you,

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> to the establishing your hearts blameless
in sanctification before our God and Father, in the presence of our Lord
Jesus Christ with all His saints.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> As to the rest, then, brethren, we request
you, and call upon you in the Lord Jesus, as ye did receive from us how
it behoveth you to walk and to please God, that ye may abound the more,

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> for ye have known what commands we gave you
through the Lord Jesus,

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> for this is the will of God -- your
sanctification; that ye abstain from the whoredom,

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> that each of you know his own vessel to
possess in sanctification and honour,

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> not in the affection of desire, as also the
nations that were not knowing God,

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> that no one go beyond and defraud in the
matter his brother, because an avenger \[is\] the Lord of all these, as
also we spake before to you and testified,

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> for God did not call us on uncleanness, but
in sanctification;

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> he, therefore, who is despising -- doth not
despise man, but God, who also did give His Holy Spirit to us.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> And concerning the brotherly love, ye have
no need of \[my\] writing to you, for ye yourselves are God-taught to
love one another,

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> for ye do it also to all the brethren who
\[are\] in all Macedonia; and we call upon you, brethren, to abound
still more,

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> and to study to be quiet, and to do your
own business, and to work with your own hands, as we did command you,

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> that ye may walk becomingly unto those
without, and may have lack of nothing.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> And I do not wish you to be ignorant,
brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, that ye may not
sorrow, as also the rest who have not hope,

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> for if we believe that Jesus died and
rose again, so also God those asleep through Jesus he will bring with
him,

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> for this to you we say in the word of the
Lord, that we who are living -- who do remain over to the presence of
the Lord -- may not precede those asleep,

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> because the Lord himself, in a shout, in
the voice of a chief-messenger, and in the trump of God, shall come down
from heaven, and the dead in Christ shall rise first,

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> then we who are living, who are remaining
over, together with them shall be caught away in clouds to meet the Lord
in air, and so always with the Lord we shall be;

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> so, then, comfort ye one another in these
words.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> And concerning the times and the seasons,
brethren, ye have no need of my writing to you,

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> for yourselves have known thoroughly that
the day of the Lord as a thief in the night doth so come,

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> for when they may say, Peace and surety,
then sudden destruction doth stand by them, as the travail \[doth\] her
who is with child, and they shall not escape;

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> and ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that
the day may catch you as a thief;

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> all ye are sons of light, and sons of day;
we are not of night, nor of darkness,

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> so, then, we may not sleep as also the
others, but watch and be sober,

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> for those sleeping, by night do sleep, and
those making themselves drunk, by night are drunken,

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> and we, being of the day -- let us be
sober, putting on a breastplate of faith and love, and an helmet -- a
hope of salvation,

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> because God did not appoint us to anger,
but to the acquiring of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> who did die for us, that whether we wake
-- whether we sleep -- together with him we may live;

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> wherefore, comfort ye one another, and
build ye up, one the one, as also ye do.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> And we ask you, brethren, to know those
labouring among you, and leading you in the Lord, and admonishing you,

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> and to esteem them very abundantly in
love, because of their work; be at peace among yourselves;

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> and we exhort you, brethren, admonish the
disorderly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the infirm, be patient
unto all;

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> see no one evil for evil may render to
any one, but always that which is good pursue ye, both to one another
and to all;

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> always rejoice ye;

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> continually pray ye;

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> in every thing give thanks, for this
\[is\] the will of God in Christ Jesus in regard to you.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> The Spirit quench not;

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> prophesyings despise not;

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> all things prove; that which is good hold
fast;

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> from all appearance of evil abstain ye;

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> and the God of the peace Himself sanctify
you wholly, and may your whole spirit, and soul, and body, be preserved
unblameably in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ;

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> stedfast is He who is calling you, who
also will do \[it\].

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> Brethren, pray for us;

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> salute all the brethren in an holy kiss;

<span id="an_5:27">5:27</span> I charge you \[by\] the Lord, that the
letter be read to all the holy brethren;

<span id="an_5:28">5:28</span> the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ \[is\]
with you! Amen.
