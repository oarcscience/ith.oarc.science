### Young's Literal Translation: 3 John

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The Elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love
in truth!

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> beloved, concerning all things I desire
thee to prosper, and to be in health, even as thy soul doth prosper,

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> for I rejoiced exceedingly, brethren coming
and testifying of the truth in thee, even as thou in truth dost walk;

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> greater than these things I have no joy,
that I may hear of my children in truth walking.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Beloved, faithfully dost thou do whatever
thou mayest work to the brethren and to the strangers,

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> who did testify of thy love before an
assembly, whom thou wilt do well, having sent forward worthily of God,

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> because for \[His\] name they went forth,
nothing receiving from the nations;

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> we, then, ought to receive such, that
fellow-workers we may become to the truth.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> I did write to the assembly, but he who is
loving the first place among them -- Diotrephes -- doth not receive us;

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> because of this, if I may come, I will
cause him to remember his works that he doth, with evil words prating
against us; and not content with these, neither doth he himself receive
the brethren, and those intending he doth forbid, and out of the
assembly he doth cast.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Beloved, be not thou following that which
is evil, but that which is good; he who is doing good, of God he is, and
he who is doing evil hath not seen God;

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> to Demetrius testimony hath been given by
all, and by the truth itself, and we also -- we do testify, and ye have
known that our testimony is true.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Many things I had to write, but I do not
wish through ink and pen to write to thee,

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> and I hope straightway to see thee, and
mouth to mouth we shall speak. Peace to thee! salute thee do the
friends; be saluting the friends by name.
