### Young's Literal Translation: Proverbs

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of
Israel:

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> For knowing wisdom and instruction, For
understanding sayings of intelligence,

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> For receiving the instruction of wisdom,
Righteousness, judgment, and uprightness,

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> For giving to simple ones -- prudence, To a
youth -- knowledge and discretion.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> (The wise doth hear and increaseth
learning, And the intelligent doth obtain counsels.)

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> For understanding a proverb and its
sweetness, Words of the wise and their acute sayings.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> Fear of Jehovah \[is\] a beginning of
knowledge, Wisdom and instruction fools have despised!

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Hear, my son, the instruction of thy
father, And leave not the law of thy mother,

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> For a graceful wreath \[are\] they to thy
head, And chains to thy neck.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> My son, if sinners entice thee be not
willing.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> If they say, \`Come with us, we lay wait
for blood, We watch secretly for the innocent without cause,

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> We swallow them as Sheol -- alive, And
whole -- as those going down \[to\] the pit,

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Every precious substance we find, We fill
our houses \[with\] spoil,

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> Thy lot thou dost cast among us, One
purse is -- to all of us.'

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> My son! go not in the way with them,
Withhold thy foot from their path,

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> For their feet to evil do run, And they
haste to shed blood.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> Surely in vain is the net spread out
before the eyes of any bird.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> And they for their own blood lay wait,
They watch secretly for their own lives.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> So \[are\] the paths of every gainer of
dishonest gain, The life of its owners it taketh.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> Wisdom in an out-place crieth aloud, In
broad places she giveth forth her voice,

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> At the head of the multitudes she
calleth, In the openings of the gates, In the city her sayings she
saith:

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> \`Till when, ye simple, do ye love
simplicity? And have scorners their scorning desired? And do fools hate
knowledge?

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> Turn back at my reproof, lo, I pour forth
to you my spirit, I make known my words with you.

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> Because I have called, and ye refuse, I
stretched out my hand, and none is attending,

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> And ye slight all my counsel, And my
reproof ye have not desired.

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> I also in your calamity do laugh, I
deride when your fear cometh,

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> When your fear cometh as destruction, And
your calamity as a hurricane doth come, When on you come adversity and
distress.

<span id="an_1:28">1:28</span> Then they call me, and I do not answer,
They seek me earnestly, and find me not.

<span id="an_1:29">1:29</span> Because that they have hated knowledge,
And the fear of Jehovah have not chosen.

<span id="an_1:30">1:30</span> They have not consented to my counsel,
They have despised all my reproof,

<span id="an_1:31">1:31</span> And they eat of the fruit of their way,
And from their own counsels they are filled.

<span id="an_1:32">1:32</span> For the turning of the simple slayeth
them, And the security of the foolish destroyeth them.

<span id="an_1:33">1:33</span> And whoso is hearkening to me dwelleth
confidently, And \[is\] quiet from fear of evil!'

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> My son, if thou dost accept my sayings, And
my commands dost lay up with thee,

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> To cause thine ear to attend to wisdom,
Thou inclinest thy heart to understanding,

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> For, if for intelligence thou callest, For
understanding givest forth thy voice,

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> If thou dost seek her as silver, And as hid
treasures searchest for her,

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Then understandest thou fear of Jehovah,
And knowledge of God thou findest.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> For Jehovah giveth wisdom, From His mouth
knowledge and understanding.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> Even to lay up for the upright substance, A
shield for those walking uprightly.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> To keep the paths of judgment, And the way
of His saints He preserveth.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> Then understandest thou righteousness, And
judgment, and uprightness -- every good path.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> For wisdom cometh into thy heart, And
knowledge to thy soul is pleasant,

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> Thoughtfulness doth watch over thee,
Understanding doth keep thee,

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> To deliver thee from an evil way, From
any speaking froward things,

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> Who are forsaking paths of uprightness,
To walk in ways of darkness,

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> Who are rejoicing to do evil, They
delight in frowardness of the wicked,

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> Whose paths \[are\] crooked, Yea, they
are perverted in their ways.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> To deliver thee from the strange woman,
From the stranger who hath made smooth her sayings,

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> Who is forsaking the guide of her youth,
And the covenant of her God hath forgotten.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> For her house hath inclined unto death,
And unto Rephaim her paths.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> None going in unto her turn back, Nor do
they reach the paths of life.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> That thou dost go in the way of the good,
And the paths of the righteous dost keep.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> For the upright do inhabit the earth, And
the perfect are left in it,

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> And the wicked from the earth are cut
off, And treacherous dealers plucked out of it!

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> My son! my law forget not, And my commands
let thy heart keep,

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> For length of days and years, Life and
peace they do add to thee.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> Let not kindness and truth forsake thee,
Bind them on thy neck, Write them on the tablet of thy heart,

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> And find grace and good understanding In
the eyes of God and man.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Trust unto Jehovah with all thy heart, And
unto thine own understanding lean not.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> In all thy ways know thou Him, And He doth
make straight thy paths.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Be not wise in thine own eyes, Fear
Jehovah, and turn aside from evil.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Healing it is to thy navel, And moistening
to thy bones.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> Honour Jehovah from thy substance, And from
the beginning of all thine increase;

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> And filled are thy barns \[with\] plenty,
And \[with\] new wine thy presses break forth.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Chastisement of Jehovah, my son, despise
not, And be not vexed with His reproof,

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> For whom Jehovah loveth He reproveth,
Even as a father the son He is pleased with.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> O the happiness of a man \[who\] hath
found wisdom, And of a man \[who\] bringeth forth understanding.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> For better \[is\] her merchandise Than
the merchandise of silver, And than gold -- her increase.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> Precious she \[is\] above rubies, And all
thy pleasures are not comparable to her.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> Length of days \[is\] in her right hand,
In her left \[are\] wealth and honour.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> Her ways \[are\] ways of pleasantness,
And all her paths \[are\] peace.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> A tree of life she \[is\] to those laying
hold on her, And whoso is retaining her \[is\] happy.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> Jehovah by wisdom did found the earth, He
prepared the heavens by understanding.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> By His knowledge depths have been rent,
And clouds do drop dew.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> My son! let them not turn from thine
eyes, Keep thou wisdom and thoughtfulness,

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> And they are life to thy soul, and grace
to thy neck.

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> Then thou goest thy way confidently, And
thy foot doth not stumble.

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> If thou liest down, thou art not afraid,
Yea, thou hast lain down, And sweet hath been thy sleep.

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> Be not afraid of sudden fear, And of the
desolation of the wicked when it cometh.

<span id="an_3:26">3:26</span> For Jehovah is at thy side, And He hath
kept thy foot from capture.

<span id="an_3:27">3:27</span> Withhold not good from its owners, When
thy hand \[is\] toward God to do \[it\].

<span id="an_3:28">3:28</span> Say not thou to thy friend, \`Go, and
return, and to-morrow I give,' And substance with thee.

<span id="an_3:29">3:29</span> Devise not against thy neighbour evil,
And he sitting confidently with thee.

<span id="an_3:30">3:30</span> Strive not with a man without cause, If
he have not done thee evil.

<span id="an_3:31">3:31</span> Be not envious of a man of violence, Nor
fix thou on any of his ways.

<span id="an_3:32">3:32</span> For an abomination to Jehovah \[is\] the
perverted, And with the upright \[is\] His secret counsel.

<span id="an_3:33">3:33</span> The curse of Jehovah \[is\] in the house
of the wicked. And the habitation of the righteous He blesseth.

<span id="an_3:34">3:34</span> If the scorners He doth scorn, Yet to the
humble He doth give grace.

<span id="an_3:35">3:35</span> Honour do the wise inherit, And fools are
bearing away shame!

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Hear, ye sons, the instruction of a father,
And give attention to know understanding.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> For good learning I have given to you, My
law forsake not.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> For, a son I have been to my father --
tender, And an only one before my mother.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> And he directeth me, and he saith to me:
\`Let thy heart retain my words, Keep my commands, and live.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Get wisdom, get understanding, Do not
forget, nor turn away From the sayings of my mouth.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> Forsake her not, and she doth preserve
thee, Love her, and she doth keep thee.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> The first thing \[is\] wisdom -- get
wisdom, And with all thy getting get understanding.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> Exalt her, and she doth lift thee up, She
honoureth thee, when thou dost embrace her.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> She giveth to thy head a wreath of grace, A
crown of beauty she doth give thee freely.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, And
years of life \[are\] multiplied to thee.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> In a way of wisdom I have directed thee,
I have caused thee to tread in paths of uprightness.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> In thy walking thy step is not
straitened, And if thou runnest, thou stumblest not.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> Lay hold on instruction, do not desist,
Keep her, for she \[is\] thy life.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> Into the path of the wicked enter not,
And be not happy in a way of evil doers.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> Avoid it, pass not over into it, Turn
aside from it, and pass on.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> For they sleep not if they do not evil,
And their sleep hath been taken violently away, If they cause not
\[some\] to stumble.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> For they have eaten bread of wickedness,
And wine of violence they drink.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> And the path of the righteous \[is\] as a
shining light, Going and brightening till the day is established,

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> The way of the wicked \[is\] as darkness,
They have not known at what they stumble.

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> My son, to my words give attention, To my
sayings incline thine ear,

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> Let them not turn aside from thine eyes,
Preserve them in the midst of thy heart.

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> For life they \[are\] to those finding
them, And to all their flesh healing.

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> Above every charge keep thy heart, For
out of it \[are\] the outgoings of life.

<span id="an_4:24">4:24</span> Turn aside from thee a froward mouth, And
perverse lips put far from thee,

<span id="an_4:25">4:25</span> Thine eyes do look straightforward, And
thine eyelids look straight before thee.

<span id="an_4:26">4:26</span> Ponder thou the path of thy feet, And all
thy ways \[are\] established.

<span id="an_4:27">4:27</span> Incline not \[to\] the right or to the
left, Turn aside thy foot from evil!

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> My son! to my wisdom give attention, To
mine understanding incline thine ear,

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> To observe thoughtfulness, And knowledge do
thy lips keep.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> For the lips of a strange woman drop honey,
And smoother than oil \[is\] her mouth,

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> And her latter end \[is\] bitter as
wormwood, Sharp as a sword \[with\] mouths.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> Her feet are going down to death, Sheol do
her steps take hold of.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> The path of life -- lest thou ponder, Moved
have her paths -- thou knowest not.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> And now, ye sons, hearken to me, And turn
not from sayings of my mouth.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> Keep far from off her thy way, And come not
near unto the opening of her house,

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> Lest thou give to others thy honour, And
thy years to the fierce,

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> Lest strangers be filled \[with\] thy
power, And thy labours in the house of a stranger,

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> And thou hast howled in thy latter end,
In the consumption of thy flesh and thy food,

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> And hast said, \`How have I hated
instruction, And reproof hath my heart despised,

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> And I have not hearkened to the voice of
my directors, And to my teachers have not inclined mine ear.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> As a little thing I have been all evil,
In the midst of an assembly and a company.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> Drink waters out of thine own cistern,
Even flowing ones out of thine own well.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> Let thy fountains be scattered abroad, In
broad places rivulets of waters.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> Let them be to thee for thyself, And not
to strangers with thee.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> Let thy fountain be blessed, And rejoice
because of the wife of thy youth,

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> A hind of loves, and a roe of grace! Let
her loves satisfy thee at all times, In her love magnify thyself
continually.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> And why dost thou magnify thyself, My
son, with a stranger? And embrace the bosom of a strange woman?

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> For over-against the eyes of Jehovah are
the ways of each, And all his paths He is pondering.

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> His own iniquities do capture the wicked,
And with the ropes of his sin he is holden.

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> He dieth without instruction, And in the
abundance of his folly magnifieth himself!

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> My son! if thou hast been surety for thy
friend, Hast stricken for a stranger thy hand,

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Hast been snared with sayings of thy mouth,
Hast been captured with sayings of thy mouth,

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> Do this now, my son, and be delivered, For
thou hast come into the hand of thy friend. Go, trample on thyself, and
strengthen thy friend,

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> Give not sleep to thine eyes, And slumber
to thine eyelids,

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> Be delivered as a roe from the hand, And as
a bird from the hand of a fowler.

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> Go unto the ant, O slothful one, See her
ways and be wise;

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> Which hath not captain, overseer, and
ruler,

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> She doth prepare in summer her bread, She
hath gathered in harvest her food.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> Till when, O slothful one, dost thou lie?
When dost thou arise from thy sleep?

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> A little sleep, a little slumber, A
little clasping of the hands to rest,

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> And thy poverty hath come as a traveller,
And thy want as an armed man.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> A man of worthlessness, a man of
iniquity, Walking \[with\] perverseness of mouth,

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> Winking with his eyes, speaking with his
feet, Directing with his fingers,

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> Frowardness \[is\] in his heart, devising
evil at all times, Contentions he sendeth forth.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> Therefore suddenly cometh his calamity,
Instantly he is broken -- and no healing.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> These six hath Jehovah hated, Yea, seven
\[are\] abominations to His soul.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> Eyes high -- tongues false -- And hands
shedding innocent blood --

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> A heart devising thoughts of vanity --
Feet hasting to run to evil --

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> A false witness \[who\] doth breathe out
lies -- And one sending forth contentions between brethren.

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> Keep, my son, the command of thy father,
And leave not the law of thy mother.

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> Bind them on thy heart continually, Tie
them on thy neck.

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> In thy going up and down, it leadeth
thee, In thy lying down, it watcheth over thee, And thou hast awaked --
it talketh \[with\] thee.

<span id="an_6:23">6:23</span> For a lamp \[is\] the command, And the
law a light, And a way of life \[are\] reproofs of instruction,

<span id="an_6:24">6:24</span> To preserve thee from an evil woman, From
the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.

<span id="an_6:25">6:25</span> Desire not her beauty in thy heart, And
let her not take thee with her eyelids.

<span id="an_6:26">6:26</span> For a harlot consumeth unto a cake of
bread, And an adulteress the precious soul hunteth.

<span id="an_6:27">6:27</span> Doth a man take fire into his bosom, And
are his garments not burnt?

<span id="an_6:28">6:28</span> Doth a man walk on the hot coals, And are
his feet not scorched?

<span id="an_6:29">6:29</span> So \[is\] he who hath gone in unto the
wife of his neighbour, None who doth touch her is innocent.

<span id="an_6:30">6:30</span> They do not despise the thief, When he
stealeth to fill his soul when he is hungry,

<span id="an_6:31">6:31</span> And being found he repayeth sevenfold,
All the substance of his house he giveth.

<span id="an_6:32">6:32</span> He who committeth adultery \[with\] a
woman lacketh heart, He is destroying his soul who doth it.

<span id="an_6:33">6:33</span> A stroke and shame he doth find, And his
reproach is not wiped away,

<span id="an_6:34">6:34</span> For jealousy \[is\] the fury of a man,
And he doth not spare in a day of vengeance.

<span id="an_6:35">6:35</span> He accepteth not the appearance of any
atonement, Yea, he doth not consent, Though thou dost multiply bribes!

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> My son! keep my sayings, And my commands
lay up with thee.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> Keep my commands, and live, And my law as
the pupil of thine eye.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> Bind them on thy fingers, Write them on the
tablet of thy heart.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> Say to wisdom, \`My sister Thou \[art\].'
And cry to understanding, \`Kinswoman!'

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> To preserve thee from a strange woman, From
a stranger who hath made smooth her sayings.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> For, at a window of my house, Through my
casement I have looked out,

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> And I do see among the simple ones, I
discern among the sons, A young man lacking understanding,

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> Passing on in the street, near her corner,
And the way \[to\] her house he doth step,

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> In the twilight -- in the evening of day,
In the darkness of night and blackness.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> And, lo, a woman to meet him -- (A
harlot's dress, and watchful of heart,

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> Noisy she \[is\], and stubborn, In her
house her feet rest not.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> Now in an out-place, now in broad places,
And near every corner she lieth in wait) --

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> And she laid hold on him, and kissed him,
She hath hardened her face, and saith to him,

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> \`Sacrifices of peace-offerings \[are\]
by me, To-day I have completed my vows.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> Therefore I have come forth to meet thee,
To seek earnestly thy face, and I find thee.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> \[With\] ornamental coverings I decked my
couch, Carved works -- cotton of Egypt.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> I sprinkled my bed -- myrrh, aloes, and
cinnamon.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> Come, we are filled \[with\] loves till
the morning, We delight ourselves in loves.

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> For the man is not in his house, He hath
gone on a long journey.

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> A bag of money he hath taken in his hand,
At the day of the new moon he cometh to his house.'

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> She turneth him aside with the abundance
of her speech, With the flattery of her lips she forceth him.

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> He is going after her straightway, As an
ox unto the slaughter he cometh, And as a fetter unto the chastisement
of a fool,

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> Till an arrow doth split his liver, As a
bird hath hastened unto a snare, And hath not known that it \[is\] for
its life.

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> And now, ye sons, hearken to me, And give
attention to sayings of my mouth.

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> Let not thy heart turn unto her ways, Do
not wander in her paths,

<span id="an_7:26">7:26</span> For many \[are\] the wounded she caused
to fall, And mighty \[are\] all her slain ones.

<span id="an_7:27">7:27</span> The ways of Sheol -- her house, Going
down unto inner chambers of death!

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> Doth not wisdom call? And understanding
give forth her voice?

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> At the head of high places by the way,
Between the paths she hath stood,

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> At the side of the gates, at the mouth of
the city, The entrance of the openings, she crieth aloud,

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> \`Unto you, O men, I call, And my voice
\[is\] unto the sons of men.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> Understand, ye simple ones, prudence, And
ye fools, understand the heart,

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> Hearken, for noble things I speak, And the
opening of my lips \[is\] uprightness.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> For truth doth my mouth utter, And an
abomination to my lips \[is\] wickedness.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> In righteousness \[are\] all the sayings of
my mouth, Nothing in them is froward and perverse.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> All of them \[are\] plain to the
intelligent, And upright to those finding knowledge.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> Receive my instruction, and not silver,
And knowledge rather than choice gold.

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> For better \[is\] wisdom than rubies,
Yea, all delights are not comparable with it.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> I, wisdom, have dwelt with prudence, And
a knowledge of devices I find out.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> The fear of Jehovah \[is\] to hate evil;
Pride, and arrogance, and an evil way, And a froward mouth, I have
hated.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> Mine \[is\] counsel and substance, I
\[am\] understanding, I have might.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> By me kings reign, and princes decree
righteousness,

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> By me do chiefs rule, and nobles, All
judges of the earth.

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> I love those loving me, And those seeking
me earnestly do find me.

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> Wealth and honour \[are\] with me,
Lasting substance and righteousness.

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> Better \[is\] my fruit than gold, even
fine gold, And mine increase than choice silver.

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> In a path of righteousness I cause to
walk, In midst of paths of judgment,

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> To cause my lovers to inherit substance,
Yea, their treasures I fill.

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> Jehovah possessed me -- the beginning of
His way, Before His works since then.

<span id="an_8:23">8:23</span> From the age I was anointed, from the
first, From former states of the earth.

<span id="an_8:24">8:24</span> In there being no depths, I was brought
forth, In there being no fountains heavy \[with\] waters,

<span id="an_8:25">8:25</span> Before mountains were sunk, Before
heights, I was brought forth.

<span id="an_8:26">8:26</span> While He had not made the earth, and
out-places, And the top of the dusts of the world.

<span id="an_8:27">8:27</span> In His preparing the heavens I \[am\]
there, In His decreeing a circle on the face of the deep,

<span id="an_8:28">8:28</span> In His strengthening clouds above, In His
making strong fountains of the deep,

<span id="an_8:29">8:29</span> In His setting for the sea its limit, And
the waters transgress not His command, In His decreeing the foundations
of earth,

<span id="an_8:30">8:30</span> Then I am near Him, a workman, And I am a
delight -- day by day. Rejoicing before Him at all times,

<span id="an_8:31">8:31</span> Rejoicing in the habitable part of His
earth, And my delights \[are\] with the sons of men.

<span id="an_8:32">8:32</span> And now, ye sons, hearken to me, Yea,
happy are they who keep my ways.

<span id="an_8:33">8:33</span> Hear instruction, and be wise, and slight
not.

<span id="an_8:34">8:34</span> O the happiness of the man hearkening to
me, To watch at my doors day by day, To watch at the door-posts of my
entrance.

<span id="an_8:35">8:35</span> For whoso is finding me, hath found life,
And bringeth out good-will from Jehovah.

<span id="an_8:36">8:36</span> And whoso is missing me, is wronging his
soul, All hating me have loved death!

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> Wisdom hath builded her house, She hath
hewn out her pillars -- seven.

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> She hath slaughtered her slaughter, She
hath mingled her wine, Yea, she hath arranged her table.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> She hath sent forth her damsels, She crieth
on the tops of the high places of the city:

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> \`Who \[is\] simple? let him turn aside
hither.' Whoso lacketh heart: she hath said to him,

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> \`Come, eat of my bread, And drink of the
wine I have mingled.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> Forsake ye, the simple, and live, And be
happy in the way of understanding.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> The instructor of a scorner Is receiving
for it -- shame, And a reprover of the wicked -- his blemish.

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee,
Give reproof to the wise, and he loveth thee.

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> Give to the wise, and he is wiser still,
Make known to the righteous, And he increaseth learning.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> The commencement of wisdom \[is\] the
fear of Jehovah, And a knowledge of the Holy Ones \[is\] understanding.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> For by me do thy days multiply, And added
to thee are years of life.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> If thou hast been wise, thou hast been
wise for thyself, And thou hast scorned -- thyself bearest \[it\].

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> A foolish woman \[is\] noisy, Simple, and
hath not known what.

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> And she hath sat at the opening of her
house, On a throne -- the high places of the city,

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> To call to those passing by the way, Who
are going straight \[on\] their paths.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> \`Who \[is\] simple? let him turn aside
hither.' And whoso lacketh heart -- she said to him,

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> \`Stolen waters are sweet, And hidden
bread is pleasant.'

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> And he hath not known that Rephaim
\[are\] there, In deep places of Sheol her invited ones!

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> Proverbs of Solomon. A wise son causeth a
father to rejoice, And a foolish son \[is\] an affliction to his mother.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> Treasures of wickedness profit not, And
righteousness delivereth from death.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> Jehovah causeth not the soul of the
righteous to hunger, And the desire of the wicked He thrusteth away.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> Poor \[is\] he who is working -- a
slothful hand, And the hand of the diligent maketh rich.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> Whoso is gathering in summer \[is\] a
wise son, Whoso is sleeping in harvest \[is\] a son causing shame.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> Blessings \[are\] for the head of the
righteous, And the mouth of the wicked cover doth violence.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> The remembrance of the righteous \[is\]
for a blessing, And the name of the wicked doth rot.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> The wise in heart accepteth commands, And
a talkative fool kicketh.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> Whoso is walking in integrity walketh
confidently, And whoso is perverting his ways is known.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> Whoso is winking the eye giveth grief,
And a talkative fool kicketh.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> A fountain of life \[is\] the mouth of
the righteous, And the mouth of the wicked cover doth violence.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> Hatred awaketh contentions, And over
all transgressions love covereth.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> In the lips of the intelligent is
wisdom found, And a rod \[is\] for the back of him who is lacking
understanding.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> The wise lay up knowledge, and the
mouth of a fool \[is\] near ruin.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> The wealth of the rich \[is\] his
strong city, The ruin of the poor \[is\] their poverty.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> The wage of the righteous \[is\] for
life, The increase of the wicked for sin.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> A traveller to life \[is\] he who is
keeping instruction, And whoso is forsaking rebuke is erring.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> Whoso is covering hatred with lying
lips, And whoso is bringing out an evil report is a fool.

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> In the abundance of words transgression
ceaseth not, And whoso is restraining his lips \[is\] wise.

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> The tongue of the righteous \[is\]
chosen silver, The heart of the wicked -- as a little thing.

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> The lips of the righteous delight many,
And fools for lack of heart die.

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> The blessing of Jehovah -- it maketh
rich, And He addeth no grief with it.

<span id="an_10:23">10:23</span> To execute inventions \[is\] as play to
a fool, And wisdom to a man of understanding.

<span id="an_10:24">10:24</span> The feared thing of the wicked it
meeteth him, And the desire of the righteous is given.

<span id="an_10:25">10:25</span> As the passing by of a hurricane, So
the wicked is not, And the righteous is a foundation age-during.

<span id="an_10:26">10:26</span> As vinegar to the teeth, And as smoke
to the eyes, So \[is\] the slothful to those sending him.

<span id="an_10:27">10:27</span> The fear of Jehovah addeth days, And
the years of the wicked are shortened.

<span id="an_10:28">10:28</span> The hope of the righteous \[is\]
joyful, And the expectation of the wicked perisheth.

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> The way of Jehovah \[is\] strength to
the perfect, And ruin to workers of iniquity.

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> The righteous to the age is not moved,
And the wicked inhabit not the earth.

<span id="an_10:31">10:31</span> The mouth of the righteous uttereth
wisdom, And the tongue of frowardness is cut out.

<span id="an_10:32">10:32</span> The lips of the righteous know a
pleasing thing, And the mouth of the wicked perverseness!

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> Balances of deceit \[are\] an abomination
to Jehovah, And a perfect weight \[is\] His delight.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> Pride hath come, and shame cometh, And
with the lowly \[is\] wisdom.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> The integrity of the upright leadeth
them, And the perverseness of the treacherous destroyeth them.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> Wealth profiteth not in a day of wrath,
And righteousness delivereth from death.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> The righteousness of the perfect maketh
right his way, And by his wickedness doth the wicked fall.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> The righteousness of the upright
delivereth them, And in mischief the treacherous are captured.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> In the death of a wicked man, hope
perisheth, And the expectation of the iniquitous hath been lost.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> The righteous from distress is drawn out,
And the wicked goeth in instead of him.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> With the mouth a hypocrite corrupteth his
friend, And by knowledge the righteous are drawn out.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> In the good of the righteous a city
exulteth, And in the destruction of the wicked \[is\] singing.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> By the blessing of the upright is a
city exalted, And by the mouth of the wicked thrown down.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> Whoso is despising his neighbour
lacketh heart, And a man of understanding keepeth silence.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> A busybody is revealing secret counsel,
And the faithful of spirit is covering the matter.

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> Without counsels do a people fall, And
deliverance \[is\] in a multitude of counsellors.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> Evil \[one\] suffereth when he hath
been surety \[for\] a stranger, And whoso is hating suretyship is
confident.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> A gracious woman retaineth honour, And
terrible \[men\] retain riches.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> A kind man is rewarding his own soul,
And the fierce is troubling his own flesh.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> The wicked is getting a lying wage, And
whoso is sowing righteousness -- a true reward.

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> Rightly \[is\] righteousness for life,
And whoso is pursuing evil -- for his own death.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> An abomination to Jehovah \[are\] the
perverse of heart, And the perfect of the way \[are\] His delight.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> Hand to hand, the wicked is not
acquitted, And the seed of the righteous hath escaped.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> A ring of gold in the nose of a sow --
A fair woman and stubborn of behaviour.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> The desire of the righteous \[is\] only
good, The hope of the wicked \[is\] transgression.

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> There is who is scattering, and yet is
increased, And who is keeping back from uprightness, only to want.

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> A liberal soul is made fat, And whoso
is watering, he also is watered.

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> Whoso is withholding corn, the people
execrate him, And a blessing \[is\] for the head of him who is selling.

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> Whoso is earnestly seeking good Seeketh
a pleasing thing, And whoso is seeking evil -- it meeteth him.

<span id="an_11:28">11:28</span> Whoso is confident in his wealth he
falleth, And as a leaf, the righteous flourish.

<span id="an_11:29">11:29</span> Whoso is troubling his own house
inheriteth wind, And a servant \[is\] the fool to the wise of heart.

<span id="an_11:30">11:30</span> The fruit of the righteous \[is\] a
tree of life, And whoso is taking souls \[is\] wise.

<span id="an_11:31">11:31</span> Lo, the righteous in the earth is
recompensed, Surely also the wicked and the sinner!

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> Whoso is loving instruction, is loving
knowledge, And whoso is hating reproof \[is\] brutish.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> The good bringeth forth favour from
Jehovah, And the man of wicked devices He condemneth.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> A man is not established by wickedness,
And the root of the righteous is not moved.

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> A virtuous woman \[is\] a crown to her
husband, And as rottenness in his bones \[is\] one causing shame.

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> The thoughts of the righteous \[are\]
justice, The counsels of the wicked -- deceit.

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> The words of the wicked \[are\]: \`Lay
wait for blood,' And the mouth of the upright delivereth them.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> Overthrow the wicked, and they are not,
And the house of the righteous standeth.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> According to his wisdom is a man praised,
And the perverted of heart becometh despised.

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> Better \[is\] the lightly esteemed who
hath a servant, Than the self-honoured who lacketh bread.

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> The righteous knoweth the life of his
beast, And the mercies of the wicked \[are\] cruel.

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> Whoso is tilling the ground is
satisfied \[with\] bread, And whoso is pursuing vanities is lacking
heart,

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> The wicked hath desired the net of evil
doers, And the root of the righteous giveth.

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> In transgression of the lips \[is\] the
snare of the wicked, And the righteous goeth out from distress.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> From the fruit of the mouth \[is\] one
satisfied \[with\] good, And the deed of man's hands returneth to him.

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> The way of a fool \[is\] right in his
own eyes, And whoso is hearkening to counsel \[is\] wise.

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> The fool -- in a day is his anger
known, And the prudent is covering shame.

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> Whoso uttereth faithfulness declareth
righteousness, And a false witness -- deceit.

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> A rash speaker is like piercings of a
sword, And the tongue of the wise is healing.

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> The lip of truth is established for
ever, And for a moment -- a tongue of falsehood.

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> Deceit \[is\] in the heart of those
devising evil, And to those counselling peace \[is\] joy.

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> No iniquity is desired by the
righteous, And the wicked have been full of evil.

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> An abomination to Jehovah \[are\] lying
lips, And stedfast doers \[are\] his delight.

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> A prudent man is concealing knowledge,
And the heart of fools proclaimeth folly.

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> The hand of the diligent ruleth, And
slothfulness becometh tributary.

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> Sorrow in the heart of a man boweth
down, And a good word maketh him glad.

<span id="an_12:26">12:26</span> The righteous searcheth his companion,
And the way of the wicked causeth them to err.

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> The slothful roasteth not his hunting,
And the wealth of a diligent man is precious.

<span id="an_12:28">12:28</span> In the path of righteousness \[is\]
life, And in the way of \[that\] path \[is\] no death!

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> A wise son -- the instruction of a
father, And a scorner -- he hath not heard rebuke.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> From the fruit of the mouth a man eateth
good, And the soul of the treacherous -- violence.

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> Whoso is keeping his mouth, is keeping
his soul, Whoso is opening wide his lips -- ruin to him!

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> The soul of the slothful is desiring, and
hath not. And the soul of the diligent is made fat.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> A false word the righteous hateth, And
the wicked causeth abhorrence, and is confounded.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> Righteousness keepeth him who is perfect
in the way, And wickedness overthroweth a sin offering.

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> There is who is making himself rich, and
hath nothing, Who is making himself poor, and wealth \[is\] abundant.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> The ransom of a man's life \[are\] his
riches, And the poor hath not heard rebuke.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> The light of the righteous rejoiceth, And
the lamp of the wicked is extinguished.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> A vain man through pride causeth
debate, And with the counselled \[is\] wisdom.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> Wealth from vanity becometh little, And
whoso is gathering by the hand becometh great.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> Hope prolonged is making the heart
sick, And a tree of life \[is\] the coming desire.

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> Whoso is despising the Word is
destroyed for it, And whoso is fearing the Command is repayed.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> The law of the wise \[is\] a fountain
of life, To turn aside from snares of death.

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> Good understanding giveth grace, And
the way of the treacherous \[is\] hard.

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> Every prudent one dealeth with
knowledge, And a fool spreadeth out folly.

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> A wicked messenger falleth into evil,
And a faithful ambassador is healing.

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> Whoso is refusing instruction --
poverty and shame, And whoso is observing reproof is honoured.

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> A desire accomplished is sweet to the
soul, And an abomination to fools \[is\]: Turn from evil.

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> Whoso is walking with wise men is wise,
And a companion of fools suffereth evil.

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> Evil pursueth sinners, And good
recompenseth the righteous.

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> A good man causeth sons' sons to
inherit, And laid up for the righteous \[is\] the sinner's wealth.

<span id="an_13:23">13:23</span> Abundance of food -- the tillage of the
poor, And substance is consumed without judgment.

<span id="an_13:24">13:24</span> Whoso is sparing his rod is hating his
son, And whoso is loving him hath hastened him chastisement.

<span id="an_13:25">13:25</span> The righteous is eating to the satiety
of his soul, And the belly of the wicked lacketh!

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> Every wise woman hath builded her house,
And the foolish with her hands breaketh it down.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> Whoso is walking in his uprightness is
fearing Jehovah, And the perverted \[in\] his ways is despising Him.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> In the mouth of a fool \[is\] a rod of
pride, And the lips of the wise preserve them.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> Without oxen a stall \[is\] clean, And
great \[is\] the increase by the power of the ox.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> A faithful witness lieth not, And a false
witness breatheth out lies.

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> A scorner hath sought wisdom, and it is
not, And knowledge to the intelligent \[is\] easy.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> Go from before a foolish man, Or thou
hast not known the lips of knowledge.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> The wisdom of the prudent \[is\] to
understand his way, And the folly of fools \[is\] deceit.

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> Fools mock at a guilt-offering, And among
the upright -- a pleasing thing.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> The heart knoweth its own bitterness,
And with its joy a stranger doth not intermeddle.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> The house of the wicked is destroyed,
And the tent of the upright flourisheth.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> There is a way -- right before a man,
And its latter end \[are\] ways of death.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> Even in laughter is the heart pained,
And the latter end of joy \[is\] affliction.

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> From his ways is the backslider in
heart filled, And a good man -- from his fruits.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> The simple giveth credence to
everything, And the prudent attendeth to his step.

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> The wise is fearing and turning from
evil, And a fool is transgressing and is confident.

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> Whoso is short of temper doth folly,
And a man of wicked devices is hated.

<span id="an_14:18">14:18</span> The simple have inherited folly, And
the prudent are crowned \[with\] knowledge.

<span id="an_14:19">14:19</span> The evil have bowed down before the
good, And the wicked at the gates of the righteous.

<span id="an_14:20">14:20</span> Even of his neighbour is the poor
hated, And those loving the rich \[are\] many.

<span id="an_14:21">14:21</span> Whoso is despising his neighbour
sinneth, Whoso is favouring the humble, O his happiness.

<span id="an_14:22">14:22</span> Do not they err who are devising evil?
And kindness and truth \[are\] to those devising good,

<span id="an_14:23">14:23</span> In all labour there is advantage, And a
thing of the lips \[is\] only to want.

<span id="an_14:24">14:24</span> The crown of the wise is their wealth,
The folly of fools \[is\] folly.

<span id="an_14:25">14:25</span> A true witness is delivering souls, And
a deceitful one breatheth out lies.

<span id="an_14:26">14:26</span> In the fear of Jehovah \[is\] strong
confidence, And to His sons there is a refuge.

<span id="an_14:27">14:27</span> The fear of Jehovah \[is\] a fountain
of life, To turn aside from snares of death.

<span id="an_14:28">14:28</span> In the multitude of a people \[is\] the
honour of a king, And in lack of people the ruin of a prince.

<span id="an_14:29">14:29</span> Whoso is slow to anger \[is\] of great
understanding, And whoso is short in temper is exalting folly.

<span id="an_14:30">14:30</span> A healed heart \[is\] life to the
flesh, And rottenness to the bones \[is\] envy.

<span id="an_14:31">14:31</span> An oppressor of the poor reproacheth
his Maker, And whoso is honouring Him Is favouring the needy.

<span id="an_14:32">14:32</span> In his wickedness is the wicked driven
away, And trustful in his death \[is\] the righteous.

<span id="an_14:33">14:33</span> In the heart of the intelligent wisdom
doth rest. And in the midst of fools it is known.

<span id="an_14:34">14:34</span> Righteousness exalteth a nation, And
the goodliness of peoples \[is\] a sin-offering.

<span id="an_14:35">14:35</span> The favour of a king \[is\] to a wise
servant, And an object of his wrath is one causing shame!

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> A soft answer turneth back fury, And a
grievous word raiseth up anger.

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> The tongue of the wise maketh knowledge
good, And the mouth of fools uttereth folly.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> In every place are the eyes of Jehovah,
Watching the evil and the good.

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> A healed tongue \[is\] a tree of life,
And perverseness in it -- a breach in the spirit.

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> A fool despiseth the instruction of his
father, And whoso is regarding reproof is prudent.

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> \[In\] the house of the righteous \[is\]
abundant strength, And in the increase of the wicked -- trouble.

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> The lips of the wise scatter knowledge,
And the heart of fools \[is\] not right.

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> The sacrifice of the wicked \[is\] an
abomination to Jehovah, And the prayer of the upright \[is\] His
delight.

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> An abomination to Jehovah \[is\] the way
of the wicked, And whoso is pursuing righteousness He loveth.

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> Chastisement \[is\] grievous to him who
is forsaking the path, Whoso is hating reproof dieth.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> Sheol and destruction \[are\] before
Jehovah, Surely also the hearts of the sons of men.

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> A scorner loveth not his reprover, Unto
the wise he goeth not.

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> A joyful heart maketh glad the face,
And by grief of heart is the spirit smitten.

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> The heart of the intelligent seeketh
knowledge, And the mouth of fools enjoyeth folly.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> All the days of the afflicted \[are\]
evil, And gladness of heart \[is\] a perpetual banquet.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> Better \[is\] a little with the fear of
Jehovah, Than much treasure, and tumult with it.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> Better \[is\] an allowance of green
herbs and love there, Than a fatted ox, and hatred with it.

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> A man of fury stirreth up contention,
And the slow to anger appeaseth strife.

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> The way of the slothful \[is\] as a
hedge of briers, And the path of the upright is raised up.

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> A wise son rejoiceth a father. And a
foolish man is despising his mother.

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> Folly is joy to one lacking heart, And
a man of intelligence directeth \[his\] going.

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> Without counsel \[is\] the making void
of purposes, And in a multitude of counsellors it is established.

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> Joy \[is\] to a man in the answer of
his mouth, And a word in its season -- how good!

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> A path of life \[is\] on high for the
wise, To turn aside from Sheol beneath.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> The house of the proud Jehovah pulleth
down, And He setteth up the border of the widow.

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> An abomination to Jehovah \[are\]
thoughts of wickedness, And pure \[are\] sayings of pleasantness.

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> A dishonest gainer is troubling his
house, And whoso is hating gifts liveth.

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> The heart of the righteous meditateth
to answer, And the mouth of the wicked uttereth evil things.

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> Far \[is\] Jehovah from the wicked, And
the prayer of the righteous He heareth.

<span id="an_15:30">15:30</span> The light of the eyes rejoiceth the
heart, A good report maketh fat the bone.

<span id="an_15:31">15:31</span> An ear that is hearing the reproof of
life Doth lodge among the wise.

<span id="an_15:32">15:32</span> Whoso is refusing instruction is
despising his soul, And whoso is hearing reproof Is getting
understanding.

<span id="an_15:33">15:33</span> The fear of Jehovah \[is\] the
instruction of wisdom, And before honour \[is\] humility!

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> Of man \[are\] arrangements of the heart,
And from Jehovah an answer of the tongue.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> All the ways of a man are pure in his own
eyes, And Jehovah is pondering the spirits.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> Roll unto Jehovah thy works, And
established are thy purposes,

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> All things hath Jehovah wrought for
Himself, And also the wicked \[worketh\] for a day of evil.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> An abomination to Jehovah \[is\] every
proud one of heart, Hand to hand he is not acquitted.

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> In kindness and truth pardoned is
iniquity, And in the fear of Jehovah Turn thou aside from evil.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> When a man's ways please Jehovah, even
his enemies, He causeth to be at peace with him.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> Better \[is\] a little with
righteousness, Than abundance of increase without justice.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> The heart of man deviseth his way, And
Jehovah establisheth his step.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> An oath \[is\] on the lips of a king,
In judgment his mouth trespasseth not.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> A just beam and balances \[are\]
Jehovah's, His work \[are\] all the stones of the bag.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> An abomination to kings \[is\] doing
wickedness, For by righteousness is a throne established.

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> The delight of kings \[are\] righteous
lips, And whoso is speaking uprightly he loveth,

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> The fury of a king \[is\] messengers of
death, And a wise man pacifieth it.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> In the light of a king's face \[is\]
life, And his good-will \[is\] as a cloud of the latter rain.

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> To get wisdom -- how much better than
gold, And to get understanding to be chosen than silver!

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> A highway of the upright \[is\], \`Turn
from evil,' Whoso is preserving his soul is watching his way.

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> Before destruction \[is\] pride, And
before stumbling -- a haughty spirit.'

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> Better is humility of spirit with the
poor, Than to apportion spoil with the proud.

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> The wise in any matter findeth good,
And whoso is trusting in Jehovah, O his happiness.

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> To the wise in heart is called,
\`Intelligent,' And sweetness of lips increaseth learning.

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> A fountain of life \[is\] understanding
to its possessors, The instruction of fools is folly.

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> The heart of the wise causeth his mouth
to act wisely, And by his lips he increaseth learning,

<span id="an_16:24">16:24</span> Sayings of pleasantness \[are\] a
honeycomb, Sweet to the soul, and healing to the bone.

<span id="an_16:25">16:25</span> There is a way right before a man, And
its latter end -- ways of death.

<span id="an_16:26">16:26</span> A labouring man hath laboured for
himself, For his mouth hath caused \[him\] to bend over it.

<span id="an_16:27">16:27</span> A worthless man is preparing evil, And
on his lips -- as a burning fire.

<span id="an_16:28">16:28</span> A froward man sendeth forth contention,
A tale-bearer is separating a familiar friend.

<span id="an_16:29">16:29</span> A violent man enticeth his neighbour,
And hath causeth him to go in a way not good.

<span id="an_16:30">16:30</span> Consulting his eyes to devise froward
things, Moving his lips he hath accomplished evil.

<span id="an_16:31">16:31</span> A crown of beauty \[are\] grey hairs,
In the way of righteousness it is found.

<span id="an_16:32">16:32</span> Better \[is\] the slow to anger than
the mighty, And the ruler over his spirit than he who is taking a city.

<span id="an_16:33">16:33</span> Into the centre is the lot cast, And
from Jehovah \[is\] all its judgment!

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> Better \[is\] a dry morsel, and rest with
it, Than a house full of the sacrifices of strife.

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> A wise servant ruleth over a son causing
shame, And in the midst of brethren He apportioneth an inheritance.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> A refining pot \[is\] for silver, and a
furnace for gold, And the trier of hearts \[is\] Jehovah.

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> An evil doer is attentive to lips of
vanity, Falsehood is giving ear to a mischievous tongue.

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> Whoso is mocking at the poor Hath
reproached his Maker, Whoso is rejoicing at calamity is not acquitted.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> Sons' sons \[are\] the crown of old men,
And the glory of sons \[are\] their fathers.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> Not comely for a fool is a lip of
excellency, Much less for a noble a lip of falsehood.

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> A stone of grace \[is\] the bribe in the
eyes of its possessors, Whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> Whoso is covering transgression is
seeking love, And whoso is repeating a matter Is separating a familiar
friend.

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> Rebuke cometh down on the intelligent
More than a hundred stripes on a fool.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> An evil man seeketh only rebellion, And
a fierce messenger is sent against him.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> The meeting of a bereaved bear by a
man, And -- not a fool in his folly.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> Whoso is returning evil for good, Evil
moveth not from his house.

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> The beginning of contention \[is\] a
letting out of waters, And before it is meddled with leave the strife.

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> Whoso is justifying the wicked, And
condemning the righteous, Even both of these \[are\] an abomination to
Jehovah.

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> Why \[is\] this -- a price in the hand
of a fool to buy wisdom, And a heart there is none?

<span id="an_17:17">17:17</span> At all times is the friend loving, And
a brother for adversity is born.

<span id="an_17:18">17:18</span> A man lacking heart is striking hands,
A surety he becometh before his friend.

<span id="an_17:19">17:19</span> Whoso is loving transgression is loving
debate, Whoso is making high his entrance is seeking destruction.

<span id="an_17:20">17:20</span> The perverse of heart findeth not good,
And the turned in his tongue falleth into evil.

<span id="an_17:21">17:21</span> Whoso is begetting a fool hath
affliction for it, Yea, the father of a fool rejoiceth not.

<span id="an_17:22">17:22</span> A rejoicing heart doth good to the
body, And a smitten spirit drieth the bone.

<span id="an_17:23">17:23</span> A bribe from the bosom the wicked
taketh, To turn aside the paths of judgment.

<span id="an_17:24">17:24</span> The face of the intelligent \[is\] to
wisdom, And the eyes of a fool -- at the end of the earth.

<span id="an_17:25">17:25</span> A provocation to his father \[is\] a
foolish son, And bitterness to her that bare him.

<span id="an_17:26">17:26</span> Also, to fine the righteous is not
good, To smite nobles for uprightness.

<span id="an_17:27">17:27</span> One acquainted with knowledge is
sparing his words, And the cool of temper \[is\] a man of understanding.

<span id="an_17:28">17:28</span> Even a fool keeping silence is reckoned
wise, He who is shutting his lips intelligent!

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> For \[an object of\] desire he who is
separated doth seek, With all wisdom he intermeddleth.

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> A fool delighteth not in understanding,
But -- in uncovering his heart.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> With the coming of the wicked come also
hath contempt, And with shame -- reproach.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> Deep waters \[are\] the words of a man's
mouth, The fountain of wisdom \[is\] a flowing brook.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> Acceptance of the face of the wicked
\[is\] not good, To turn aside the righteous in judgment.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> The lips of a fool enter into strife, And
his mouth for stripes calleth.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> The mouth of a fool \[is\] ruin to him,
And his lips \[are\] the snare of his soul.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> The words of a tale-bearer \[are\] as
self-inflicted wounds, And they have gone down \[to\] the inner parts of
the heart.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> He also that is remiss in his work, A
brother he \[is\] to a destroyer.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> A tower of strength \[is\] the name of
Jehovah, Into it the righteous runneth, and is set on high.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> The wealth of the rich \[is\] the city
of his strength, And as a wall set on high in his own imagination.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> Before destruction the heart of man is
high, And before honour \[is\] humility.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> Whoso is answering a matter before he
heareth, Folly it is to him and shame.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> The spirit of a man sustaineth his
sickness, And a smitten spirit who doth bear?

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> The heart of the intelligent getteth
knowledge, And the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> The gift of a man maketh room for him,
And before the great it leadeth him.

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> Righteous \[is\] the first in his own
cause, His neighbour cometh and hath searched him.

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> The lot causeth contentions to cease,
And between the mighty it separateth.

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> A brother transgressed against is as a
strong city, And contentions as the bar of a palace.

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> From the fruit of a man's mouth is his
belly satisfied, \[From the\] increase of his lips he is satisfied.

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> Death and life \[are\] in the power of
the tongue, And those loving it eat its fruit.

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> \[Whoso\] hath found a wife hath found
good, And bringeth out good-will from Jehovah.

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> \[With\] supplications doth the poor
speak, And the rich answereth fierce things.

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> A man with friends \[is\] to show
himself friendly, And there is a lover adhering more than a brother!

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> Better \[is\] the poor walking in his
integrity, Than the perverse \[in\] his lips, who \[is\] a fool.

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> Also, without knowledge the soul \[is\]
not good, And the hasty in feet is sinning.

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> The folly of man perverteth his way, And
against Jehovah is his heart wroth.

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> Wealth addeth many friends, And the poor
from his neighbour is separated.

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> A false witness is not acquitted, Whoso
breatheth out lies is not delivered.

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> Many entreat the face of the noble, And
all have made friendship to a man of gifts.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> All the brethren of the poor have hated
him, Surely also his friends have been far from him, He is pursuing
words -- they are not!

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> Whoso is getting heart is loving his
soul, He is keeping understanding to find good.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> A false witness is not acquitted, And
whoso breatheth out lies perisheth.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> Luxury is not comely for a fool, Much
less for a servant to rule among princes.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> The wisdom of a man hath deferred his
anger, And his glory \[is\] to pass over transgression.

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> The wrath of a king \[is\] a growl as
of a young lion, And as dew on the herb his good-will.

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> A calamity to his father \[is\] a
foolish son, And the contentions of a wife \[are\] a continual dropping.

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> House and wealth \[are\] the
inheritance of fathers, And from Jehovah \[is\] an understanding wife.

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> Sloth causeth deep sleep to fall, And
an indolent soul doth hunger.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> Whoso is keeping the command is keeping
his soul, Whoso is despising His ways dieth.

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> Whoso is lending \[to\] Jehovah is
favouring the poor, And his deed He repayeth to him.

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> Chastise thy son, for there is hope,
And to put him to death lift not up thy soul.

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> A man of great wrath is bearing
punishment, For, if thou dost deliver, yet again thou dost add.

<span id="an_19:20">19:20</span> Hear counsel and receive instruction,
So that thou art wise in thy latter end.

<span id="an_19:21">19:21</span> Many \[are\] the purposes in a man's
heart, And the counsel of Jehovah it standeth.

<span id="an_19:22">19:22</span> The desirableness of a man \[is\] his
kindness, And better \[is\] the poor than a liar.

<span id="an_19:23">19:23</span> The fear of Jehovah \[is\] to life, And
satisfied he remaineth -- he is not charged with evil.

<span id="an_19:24">19:24</span> The slothful hath hidden his hand in a
dish, Even unto his mouth he bringeth it not back.

<span id="an_19:25">19:25</span> A scorner smite, and the simple acts
prudently, And give reproof to the intelligent, He understandeth
knowledge.

<span id="an_19:26">19:26</span> Whoso is spoiling a father causeth a
mother to flee, A son causing shame, and bringing confusion.

<span id="an_19:27">19:27</span> Cease, my son, to hear instruction --
To err from sayings of knowledge.

<span id="an_19:28">19:28</span> A worthless witness scorneth judgment,
And the mouth of the wicked swalloweth iniquity.

<span id="an_19:29">19:29</span> Judgments have been prepared for
scorners, And stripes for the back of fools!

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> Wine \[is\] a scorner -- strong drink
\[is\] noisy, And any going astray in it is not wise.

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> The fear of a king \[is\] a growl as of a
young lion, He who is causing him to be wroth is wronging his soul.

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> An honour to a man is cessation from
strife, And every fool intermeddleth.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> Because of winter the slothful plougheth
not, He asketh in harvest, and there is nothing.

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> Counsel in the heart of a man \[is\] deep
water, And a man of understanding draweth it up.

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> A multitude of men proclaim each his
kindness, And a man of stedfastness who doth find?

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> The righteous is walking habitually in
his integrity, O the happiness of his sons after him!

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> A king sitting on a throne of judgment,
Is scattering with his eyes all evil,

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> Who saith, \`I have purified my heart, I
have been cleansed from my sin?'

<span id="an_20:10">20:10</span> A stone and a stone, an ephah and an
ephah, Even both of them \[are\] an abomination to Jehovah.

<span id="an_20:11">20:11</span> Even by his actions a youth maketh
himself known, Whether his work be pure or upright.

<span id="an_20:12">20:12</span> A hearing ear, and a seeing eye,
Jehovah hath made even both of them.

<span id="an_20:13">20:13</span> Love not sleep, lest thou become poor,
Open thine eyes -- be satisfied \[with\] bread.

<span id="an_20:14">20:14</span> \`Bad, bad,' saith the buyer, And going
his way then he boasteth himself.

<span id="an_20:15">20:15</span> Substance, gold, and a multitude of
rubies, Yea, a precious vessel, \[are\] lips of knowledge.

<span id="an_20:16">20:16</span> Take his garment when a stranger hath
been surety, And for strangers pledge it.

<span id="an_20:17">20:17</span> Sweet to a man \[is\] the bread of
falsehood, And afterwards is his mouth filled \[with\] gravel.

<span id="an_20:18">20:18</span> Purposes by counsel thou dost
establish, And with plans make thou war.

<span id="an_20:19">20:19</span> A revealer of secret counsels is the
busybody, And for a deceiver \[with\] his lips make not thyself surety.

<span id="an_20:20">20:20</span> Whoso is vilifying his father and his
mother, Extinguished is his lamp in blackness of darkness.

<span id="an_20:21">20:21</span> An inheritance gotten wrongly at first,
Even its latter end is not blessed.

<span id="an_20:22">20:22</span> Do not say, \`I recompense evil,' Wait
for Jehovah, and He delivereth thee.

<span id="an_20:23">20:23</span> An abomination to Jehovah \[are\] a
stone and a stone, And balances of deceit \[are\] not good.

<span id="an_20:24">20:24</span> From Jehovah \[are\] the steps of a
man, And man -- how understandeth he his way?

<span id="an_20:25">20:25</span> A snare to a man \[is\] he hath
swallowed a holy thing, And after vows to make inquiry.

<span id="an_20:26">20:26</span> A wise king is scattering the wicked,
And turneth back on them the wheel.

<span id="an_20:27">20:27</span> The breath of man \[is\] a lamp of
Jehovah, Searching all the inner parts of the heart.

<span id="an_20:28">20:28</span> Kindness and truth keep a king, And he
hath supported by kindness his throne.

<span id="an_20:29">20:29</span> The beauty of young men is their
strength, And the honour of old men is grey hairs.

<span id="an_20:30">20:30</span> The bandages of a wound thou removest
with the evil, Also the plagues of the inner parts of the heart!

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> Rivulets of waters \[is\] the heart of a
king in the hand of Jehovah, Wherever He pleaseth He inclineth it.

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> Every way of a man \[is\] right in his
own eyes, And Jehovah is pondering hearts.

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> To do righteousness and judgment, Is
chosen of Jehovah rather than sacrifice.

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> Loftiness of eyes, and breadth of heart,
Tillage of the wicked \[is\] sin.

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> The purposes of the diligent \[are\] only
to advantage, And of every hasty one, only to want.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> The making of treasures by a lying
tongue, \[Is\] a vanity driven away of those seeking death.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> The spoil of the wicked catcheth them,
Because they have refused to do judgment.

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> Froward \[is\] the way of a man who is
vile, And the pure -- upright \[is\] his work.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> Better to sit on a corner of the roof,
Than \[with\] a woman of contentions and a house of company.

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> The soul of the wicked hath desired
evil, Not gracious in his eyes is his neighbour.

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> When the scorner is punished, the
simple becometh wise, And in giving understanding to the wise He
receiveth knowledge.

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> The Righteous One is acting wisely
Towards the house of the wicked, He is overthrowing the wicked for
wickedness.

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> Whoso is shutting his ear from the cry
of the poor, He also doth cry, and is not answered.

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> A gift in secret pacifieth anger, And a
bribe in the bosom strong fury.

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> To do justice \[is\] joy to the
righteous, But ruin to workers of iniquity.

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> A man who is wandering from the way of
understanding, In an assembly of Rephaim resteth.

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> Whoso \[is\] loving mirth \[is\] a poor
man, Whoso is loving wine and oil maketh no wealth.

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> The wicked \[is\] an atonement for the
righteous, And for the upright the treacherous dealer.

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> Better to dwell in a wilderness land,
Than \[with\] a woman of contentions and anger.

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> A treasure to be desired, and oil,
\[Is\] in the habitation of the wise, And a foolish man swalloweth it
up.

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> Whoso is pursuing righteousness and
kindness, Findeth life, righteousness, and honour.

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> A city of the mighty hath the wise gone
up, And bringeth down the strength of its confidence.

<span id="an_21:23">21:23</span> Whoso is keeping his mouth and his
tongue, Is keeping from adversities his soul.

<span id="an_21:24">21:24</span> Proud, haughty, scorner \[is\] his
name, Who is working in the wrath of pride.

<span id="an_21:25">21:25</span> The desire of the slothful slayeth him,
For his hands have refused to work.

<span id="an_21:26">21:26</span> All the day desiring he hath desired,
And the righteous giveth and withholdeth not.

<span id="an_21:27">21:27</span> The sacrifice of the wicked \[is\]
abomination, Much more when in wickedness he bringeth it.

<span id="an_21:28">21:28</span> A false witness doth perish, And an
attentive man for ever speaketh.

<span id="an_21:29">21:29</span> A wicked man hath hardened by his face,
And the upright -- he prepareth his way.

<span id="an_21:30">21:30</span> There is no wisdom, nor understanding,
Nor counsel, over-against Jehovah.

<span id="an_21:31">21:31</span> A horse is prepared for a day of
battle, And the deliverance \[is\] of Jehovah!

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> A name is chosen rather than much wealth,
Than silver and than gold -- good grace.

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> Rich and poor have met together, The
Maker of them all \[is\] Jehovah.

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> The prudent hath seen the evil, and is
hidden, And the simple have passed on, and are punished.

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> The end of humility \[is\] the fear of
Jehovah, Riches, and honour, and life.

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> Thorns -- snares \[are\] in the way of
the perverse, Whoso is keeping his soul is far from them.

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> Give instruction to a youth about his
way, Even when he is old he turneth not from it.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> The rich over the poor ruleth, And a
servant \[is\] the borrower to the lender.

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> Whoso is sowing perverseness reapeth
sorrow, And the rod of his anger weareth out.

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> The good of eye -- he is blessed, For he
hath given of his bread to the poor.

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> Cast out a scorner -- and contention
goeth out, And strife and shame cease.

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> Whoso is loving cleanness of heart,
Grace \[are\] his lips, a king \[is\] his friend.

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> The eyes of Jehovah have kept
knowledge, And He overthroweth the words of the treacherous.

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> The slothful hath said, \`A lion \[is\]
without, In the midst of the broad places I am slain.'

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> A deep pit \[is\] the mouth of strange
women, The abhorred of Jehovah falleth there.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> Folly is bound up in the heart of a
youth, The rod of chastisement putteth it far from him.

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> He is oppressing the poor to multiply
to him, He is giving to the rich -- only to want.

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> Incline thine ear, and hear words of
the wise, And thy heart set to my knowledge,

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> For they are pleasant when thou dost
keep them in thy heart, They are prepared together for thy lips.

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> That thy trust may be in Jehovah, I
caused thee to know to-day, even thou.

<span id="an_22:20">22:20</span> Have I not written to thee three times
With counsels and knowledge?

<span id="an_22:21">22:21</span> To cause thee to know the certainty of
sayings of truth, To return sayings of truth to those sending thee.

<span id="an_22:22">22:22</span> Rob not the poor because he \[is\]
poor, And bruise not the afflicted in the gate.

<span id="an_22:23">22:23</span> For Jehovah pleadeth their cause, And
hath spoiled the soul of their spoilers.

<span id="an_22:24">22:24</span> Shew not thyself friendly with an angry
man, And with a man of fury go not in,

<span id="an_22:25">22:25</span> Lest thou learn his paths, And have
received a snare to thy soul.

<span id="an_22:26">22:26</span> Be not thou among those striking hands,
Among sureties \[for\] burdens.

<span id="an_22:27">22:27</span> If thou hast nothing to pay, Why doth
he take thy bed from under thee?

<span id="an_22:28">22:28</span> Remove not a border of olden times,
That thy fathers have made.

<span id="an_22:29">22:29</span> Hast thou seen a man speedy in his
business? Before kings he doth station himself, He stations not himself
before obscure men!

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> When thou sittest to eat with a ruler,
Thou considerest diligently that which \[is\] before thee,

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> And thou hast put a knife to thy throat,
If thou \[art\] a man of appetite.

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> Have no desire to his dainties, seeing it
\[is\] lying food.

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> Labour not to make wealth, From thine own
understanding cease, Dost thou cause thine eyes to fly upon it? Then it
is not.

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> For wealth maketh to itself wings, As an
eagle it flieth to the heavens.

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> Eat not the bread of an evil eye, And
have no desire to his dainties,

<span id="an_23:7">23:7</span> For as he hath thought in his soul, so
\[is\] he, \`Eat and drink,' saith he to thee, And his heart \[is\] not
with thee.

<span id="an_23:8">23:8</span> Thy morsel thou hast eaten thou dost
vomit up, And hast marred thy words that \[are\] sweet.

<span id="an_23:9">23:9</span> In the ears of a fool speak not, For he
treadeth on the wisdom of thy words.

<span id="an_23:10">23:10</span> Remove not a border of olden times, And
into fields of the fatherless enter not,

<span id="an_23:11">23:11</span> For their Redeemer \[is\] strong, He
doth plead their cause with thee.

<span id="an_23:12">23:12</span> Bring in to instruction thy heart, And
thine ear to sayings of knowledge.

<span id="an_23:13">23:13</span> Withhold not from a youth chastisement,
When thou smitest him with a rod he dieth not.

<span id="an_23:14">23:14</span> Thou with a rod smitest him, And his
soul from Sheol thou deliverest.

<span id="an_23:15">23:15</span> My son, if thy heart hath been wise, My
heart rejoiceth, even mine,

<span id="an_23:16">23:16</span> And my reins exult when thy lips speak
uprightly.

<span id="an_23:17">23:17</span> Let not thy heart be envious at
sinners, But -- in the fear of Jehovah all the day.

<span id="an_23:18">23:18</span> For, is there a posterity? Then thy
hope is not cut off.

<span id="an_23:19">23:19</span> Hear thou, my son, and be wise, And
make happy in the way thy heart,

<span id="an_23:20">23:20</span> Be not thou among quaffers of wine,
Among gluttonous ones of flesh,

<span id="an_23:21">23:21</span> For the quaffer and glutton become
poor, And drowsiness clotheth with rags.

<span id="an_23:22">23:22</span> Hearken to thy father, who begat thee,
And despise not thy mother when she hath become old.

<span id="an_23:23">23:23</span> Truth buy, and sell not, Wisdom, and
instruction, and understanding,

<span id="an_23:24">23:24</span> The father of the righteous rejoiceth
greatly, The begetter of the wise rejoiceth in him.

<span id="an_23:25">23:25</span> Rejoice doth thy father and thy mother,
Yea, she that bare thee is joyful.

<span id="an_23:26">23:26</span> Give, my son, thy heart to me, And let
thine eyes watch my ways.

<span id="an_23:27">23:27</span> For a harlot \[is\] a deep ditch, And a
strange woman \[is\] a strait pit.

<span id="an_23:28">23:28</span> She also, as catching prey, lieth in
wait, And the treacherous among men she increaseth.

<span id="an_23:29">23:29</span> Who hath wo? who hath sorrow? Who hath
contentions? who hath plaint? Who hath wounds without cause? Who hath
redness of eyes?

<span id="an_23:30">23:30</span> Those tarrying by the wine, Those going
in to search out mixed wine.

<span id="an_23:31">23:31</span> See not wine when it showeth itself
red, When it giveth in the cup its colour, It goeth up and down through
the upright.

<span id="an_23:32">23:32</span> Its latter end -- as a serpent it
biteth, And as a basilisk it stingeth.

<span id="an_23:33">23:33</span> Thine eyes see strange women, And thy
heart speaketh perverse things.

<span id="an_23:34">23:34</span> And thou hast been as one lying down in
the heart of the sea, And as one lying down on the top of a mast.

<span id="an_23:35">23:35</span> \`They smote me, I have not been sick,
They beat me, I have not known. When I awake -- I seek it yet again!'

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> Be not envious of evil men, And desire
not to be with them.

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> For destruction doth their heart
meditate, And perverseness do their lips speak.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> By wisdom is a house builded, And by
understanding it establisheth itself.

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> And by knowledge the inner parts are
filled, \[With\] all precious and pleasant wealth.

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> Mighty \[is\] the wise in strength, And a
man of knowledge is strengthening power,

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> For by plans thou makest for thyself war,
And deliverance \[is\] in a multitude of counsellors.

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> Wisdom \[is\] high for a fool, In the
gate he openeth not his mouth.

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> Whoso is devising to do evil, Him they
call a master of wicked thoughts.

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> The thought of folly \[is\] sin, And an
abomination to man \[is\] a scorner.

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> Thou hast shewed thyself weak in a day
of adversity, Straitened is thy power,

<span id="an_24:11">24:11</span> If \[from\] delivering those taken to
death, And those slipping to the slaughter -- thou keepest back.

<span id="an_24:12">24:12</span> When thou sayest, \`Lo, we knew not
this.' Is not the Ponderer of hearts He who understandeth? And the
Keeper of thy soul He who knoweth? And He hath rendered to man according
to his work.

<span id="an_24:13">24:13</span> Eat my son, honey that \[is\] good, And
the honeycomb -- sweet to thy palate.

<span id="an_24:14">24:14</span> So \[is\] the knowledge of wisdom to
thy soul, If thou hast found that there is a posterity And thy hope is
not cut off.

<span id="an_24:15">24:15</span> Lay not wait, O wicked one, At the
habitation of the righteous. Do not spoil his resting-place.

<span id="an_24:16">24:16</span> For seven \[times\] doth the righteous
fall and rise, And the wicked stumble in evil.

<span id="an_24:17">24:17</span> In the falling of thine enemy rejoice
not, And in his stumbling let not thy heart be joyful,

<span id="an_24:18">24:18</span> Lest Jehovah see, and \[it be\] evil in
His eyes, And He hath turned from off him His anger.

<span id="an_24:19">24:19</span> Fret not thyself at evil doers, Be not
envious at the wicked,

<span id="an_24:20">24:20</span> For there is not a posterity to the
evil, The lamp of the wicked is extinguished.

<span id="an_24:21">24:21</span> Fear Jehovah, my son, and the king,
With changers mix not up thyself,

<span id="an_24:22">24:22</span> For suddenly doth their calamity rise,
And the ruin of them both -- who knoweth!

<span id="an_24:23">24:23</span> These also are for the wise: -- To
discern faces in judgment is not good.

<span id="an_24:24">24:24</span> Whoso is saying to the wicked, \`Thou
\[art\] righteous,' Peoples execrate him -- nations abhor him.

<span id="an_24:25">24:25</span> And to those reproving it is pleasant,
And on them cometh a good blessing.

<span id="an_24:26">24:26</span> Lips he kisseth who is returning
straightforward words.

<span id="an_24:27">24:27</span> Prepare in an out-place thy work, And
make it ready in the field -- go afterwards, Then thou hast built thy
house.

<span id="an_24:28">24:28</span> Be not a witness for nought against thy
neighbour, Or thou hast enticed with thy lips.

<span id="an_24:29">24:29</span> Say not, \`As he did to me, so I do to
him, I render to each according to his work.'

<span id="an_24:30">24:30</span> Near the field of a slothful man I
passed by, And near the vineyard of a man lacking heart.

<span id="an_24:31">24:31</span> And lo, it hath gone up -- all of it --
thorns! Covered its face have nettles, And its stone wall hath been
broken down.

<span id="an_24:32">24:32</span> And I see -- I -- I do set my heart, I
have seen -- I have received instruction,

<span id="an_24:33">24:33</span> A little sleep -- a little slumber -- A
little folding of the hands to lie down.

<span id="an_24:34">24:34</span> And thy poverty hath come \[as\] a
traveller, And thy want as an armed man!

<span id="an_25:1">25:1</span> Also these are Proverbs of Solomon, that
men of Hezekiah king of Judah transcribed: --

<span id="an_25:2">25:2</span> The honour of God \[is\] to hide a thing,
And the honour of kings to search out a matter.

<span id="an_25:3">25:3</span> The heavens for height, and the earth for
depth, And the heart of kings -- \[are\] unsearchable.

<span id="an_25:4">25:4</span> Take away dross from silver, And a vessel
for the refiner goeth forth,

<span id="an_25:5">25:5</span> Take away the wicked before a king, And
established in righteousness is his throne.

<span id="an_25:6">25:6</span> Honour not thyself before a king, And in
the place of the great stand not.

<span id="an_25:7">25:7</span> For better \[that\] he hath said to thee,
\`Come thou up hither,' Than \[that\] he humble thee before a noble,
Whom thine eyes have seen.

<span id="an_25:8">25:8</span> Go not forth to strive, haste, turn, What
dost thou in its latter end, When thy neighbour causeth thee to blush?

<span id="an_25:9">25:9</span> Thy cause plead with thy neighbour, And
the secret counsel of another reveal not,

<span id="an_25:10">25:10</span> Lest the hearer put thee to shame, And
thine evil report turn not back.

<span id="an_25:11">25:11</span> Apples of gold in imagery of silver,
\[Is\] the word spoken at its fit times.

<span id="an_25:12">25:12</span> A ring of gold, and an ornament of pure
gold, \[Is\] the wise reprover to an attentive ear.

<span id="an_25:13">25:13</span> As a vessel of snow in a day of
harvest, \[So is\] a faithful ambassador to those sending him, And the
soul of his masters he refresheth.

<span id="an_25:14">25:14</span> Clouds and wind, and rain there is
none, \[Is\] a man boasting himself in a false gift.

<span id="an_25:15">25:15</span> By long-suffering is a ruler persuaded,
And a soft tongue breaketh a bone.

<span id="an_25:16">25:16</span> Honey thou hast found -- eat thy
sufficiency, Lest thou be satiated \[with\] it, and hast vomited it.

<span id="an_25:17">25:17</span> Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's
house, Lest he be satiated \[with\] thee, and have hated thee.

<span id="an_25:18">25:18</span> A maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow,
\[Is\] the man testifying against his neighbour a false testimony.

<span id="an_25:19">25:19</span> A bad tooth, and a tottering foot,
\[Is\] the confidence of the treacherous in a day of adversity.

<span id="an_25:20">25:20</span> Whoso is taking away a garment in a
cold day, \[Is as\] vinegar on nitre, And a singer of songs on a sad
heart.

<span id="an_25:21">25:21</span> If he who is hating thee doth hunger,
cause him to eat bread, And if he thirst, cause him to drink water.

<span id="an_25:22">25:22</span> For coals thou art putting on his head,
And Jehovah giveth recompense to thee.

<span id="an_25:23">25:23</span> A north wind bringeth forth rain, And a
secret tongue -- indignant faces.

<span id="an_25:24">25:24</span> Better to sit on a corner of a roof,
Than \[with\] a woman of contentions, and a house of company.

<span id="an_25:25">25:25</span> \[As\] cold waters for a weary soul, So
\[is\] a good report from a far country.

<span id="an_25:26">25:26</span> A spring troubled, and a fountain
corrupt, \[Is\] the righteous falling before the wicked.

<span id="an_25:27">25:27</span> The eating of much honey is not good,
Nor a searching out of one's own honour -- honour.

<span id="an_25:28">25:28</span> A city broken down without walls,
\[Is\] a man without restraint over his spirit!

<span id="an_26:1">26:1</span> As snow in summer, and as rain in
harvest, So honour \[is\] not comely for a fool.

<span id="an_26:2">26:2</span> As a bird by wandering, as a swallow by
flying, So reviling without cause doth not come.

<span id="an_26:3">26:3</span> A whip is for a horse, a bridle for an
ass, And a rod for the back of fools.

<span id="an_26:4">26:4</span> Answer not a fool according to his folly,
Lest thou be like to him -- even thou.

<span id="an_26:5">26:5</span> Answer a fool according to his folly,
Lest he be wise in his own eyes.

<span id="an_26:6">26:6</span> He is cutting off feet, he is drinking
injury, Who is sending things by the hand of a fool.

<span id="an_26:7">26:7</span> Weak have been the two legs of the lame,
And a parable in the mouth of fools.

<span id="an_26:8">26:8</span> As one who is binding a stone in a sling,
So \[is\] he who is giving honour to a fool.

<span id="an_26:9">26:9</span> A thorn hath gone up into the hand of a
drunkard, And a parable in the mouth of fools.

<span id="an_26:10">26:10</span> Great \[is\] the Former of all, And He
is rewarding a fool, And is rewarding transgressors.

<span id="an_26:11">26:11</span> As a dog hath returned to its vomit, A
fool is repeating his folly.

<span id="an_26:12">26:12</span> Thou hast seen a man wise in his own
eyes, More hope of a fool than of him!

<span id="an_26:13">26:13</span> The slothful hath said, \`A lion \[is\]
in the way, A lion \[is\] in the broad places.'

<span id="an_26:14">26:14</span> The door turneth round on its hinge,
And the slothful on his bed.

<span id="an_26:15">26:15</span> The slothful hath hid his hand in a
dish, He is weary of bringing it back to his mouth.

<span id="an_26:16">26:16</span> Wiser \[is\] the slothful in his own
eyes, Than seven \[men\] returning a reason.

<span id="an_26:17">26:17</span> Laying hold on the ears of a dog,
\[Is\] a passer-by making himself wrath for strife not his own.

<span id="an_26:18">26:18</span> As \[one\] pretending to be feeble, Who
is casting sparks, arrows, and death,

<span id="an_26:19">26:19</span> So hath a man deceived his neighbour,
And hath said, \`Am not I playing?'

<span id="an_26:20">26:20</span> Without wood is fire going out, And
without a tale-bearer, contention ceaseth,

<span id="an_26:21">26:21</span> Coal to burning coals, and wood to
fire, And a man of contentions to kindle strife.

<span id="an_26:22">26:22</span> The words of a tale-bearer \[are\] as
self-inflicted wounds, And they have gone down \[to\] the inner parts of
the heart.

<span id="an_26:23">26:23</span> Silver of dross spread over potsherd,
\[Are\] burning lips and an evil heart.

<span id="an_26:24">26:24</span> By his lips doth a hater dissemble, And
in his heart he placeth deceit,

<span id="an_26:25">26:25</span> When his voice is gracious trust not in
him, For seven abominations \[are\] in his heart.

<span id="an_26:26">26:26</span> Hatred is covered by deceit, Revealed
is its wickedness in an assembly.

<span id="an_26:27">26:27</span> Whoso is digging a pit falleth into it,
And the roller of a stone, to him it turneth.

<span id="an_26:28">26:28</span> A lying tongue hateth its bruised ones,
And a flattering mouth worketh an overthrow!

<span id="an_27:1">27:1</span> Boast not thyself of to-morrow, For thou
knowest not what a day bringeth forth.

<span id="an_27:2">27:2</span> Let another praise thee, and not thine
own mouth, A stranger, and not thine own lips.

<span id="an_27:3">27:3</span> A stone \[is\] heavy, and the sand \[is\]
heavy, And the anger of a fool Is heavier than they both.

<span id="an_27:4">27:4</span> Fury \[is\] fierce, and anger \[is\]
overflowing, And who standeth before jealousy?

<span id="an_27:5">27:5</span> Better \[is\] open reproof than hidden
love.

<span id="an_27:6">27:6</span> Faithful are the wounds of a lover, And
abundant the kisses of an enemy.

<span id="an_27:7">27:7</span> A satiated soul treadeth down a
honeycomb, And \[to\] a hungry soul every bitter thing \[is\] sweet.

<span id="an_27:8">27:8</span> As a bird wandering from her nest, So
\[is\] a man wandering from his place.

<span id="an_27:9">27:9</span> Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart,
And the sweetness of one's friend -- from counsel of the soul.

<span id="an_27:10">27:10</span> Thine own friend, and the friend of thy
father, forsake not, And the house of thy brother enter not In a day of
thy calamity, Better \[is\] a near neighbour than a brother afar off.

<span id="an_27:11">27:11</span> Be wise, my son, and rejoice my heart.
And I return my reproacher a word.

<span id="an_27:12">27:12</span> The prudent hath seen the evil, he is
hidden, The simple have passed on, they are punished.

<span id="an_27:13">27:13</span> Take his garment, when a stranger hath
been surety, And for a strange woman pledge it.

<span id="an_27:14">27:14</span> Whoso is saluting his friend with a
loud voice, In the morning rising early, A light thing it is reckoned to
him.

<span id="an_27:15">27:15</span> A continual dropping in a day of rain,
And a woman of contentions are alike,

<span id="an_27:16">27:16</span> Whoso is hiding her hath hidden the
wind, And the ointment of his right hand calleth out.

<span id="an_27:17">27:17</span> Iron by iron is sharpened, And a man
sharpens the face of his friend.

<span id="an_27:18">27:18</span> The keeper of a fig-tree eateth its
fruit, And the preserver of his master is honoured.

<span id="an_27:19">27:19</span> As \[in\] water the face \[is\] to
face, So the heart of man to man.

<span id="an_27:20">27:20</span> Sheol and destruction are not
satisfied, And the eyes of man are not satisfied.

<span id="an_27:21">27:21</span> A refining pot \[is\] for silver, and a
furnace for gold, And a man according to his praise.

<span id="an_27:22">27:22</span> If thou dost beat the foolish in a
mortar, Among washed things -- with a pestle, His folly turneth not
aside from off him.

<span id="an_27:23">27:23</span> Know well the face of thy flock, Set
thy heart to the droves,

<span id="an_27:24">27:24</span> For riches \[are\] not to the age, Nor
a crown to generation and generation.

<span id="an_27:25">27:25</span> Revealed was the hay, and seen the
tender grass, And gathered the herbs of mountains.

<span id="an_27:26">27:26</span> Lambs \[are\] for thy clothing, And the
price of the field \[are\] he-goats,

<span id="an_27:27">27:27</span> And a sufficiency of goats' milk \[is\]
for thy bread, For bread to thy house, and life to thy damsels!

<span id="an_28:1">28:1</span> The wicked have fled and there is no
pursuer. And the righteous as a young lion is confident.

<span id="an_28:2">28:2</span> By the transgression of a land many
\[are\] its heads. And by an intelligent man, Who knoweth right -- it is
prolonged.

<span id="an_28:3">28:3</span> A man -- poor and oppressing the weak,
\[Is\] a sweeping rain, and there is no bread.

<span id="an_28:4">28:4</span> Those forsaking the law praise the
wicked, Those keeping the law plead against them.

<span id="an_28:5">28:5</span> Evil men understand not judgment, And
those seeking Jehovah understand all.

<span id="an_28:6">28:6</span> Better \[is\] the poor walking in his
integrity, Than the perverse of ways who is rich.

<span id="an_28:7">28:7</span> Whoso is keeping the law is an
intelligent son, And a friend of gluttons, Doth cause his father to
blush.

<span id="an_28:8">28:8</span> Whoso is multiplying his wealth by biting
and usury, For one favouring the poor doth gather it.

<span id="an_28:9">28:9</span> Whoso is turning his ear from hearing the
law, Even his prayer \[is\] an abomination.

<span id="an_28:10">28:10</span> Whoso is causing the upright to err in
an evil way, Into his own pit he doth fall, And the perfect do inherit
good.

<span id="an_28:11">28:11</span> A rich man is wise in his own eyes, And
the intelligent poor searcheth him.

<span id="an_28:12">28:12</span> In the exulting of the righteous the
glory \[is\] abundant, And in the rising of the wicked man is
apprehensive.

<span id="an_28:13">28:13</span> Whoso is covering his transgressions
prospereth not, And he who is confessing and forsaking hath mercy.

<span id="an_28:14">28:14</span> O the happiness of a man fearing
continually, And whoso is hardening his heart falleth into evil.

<span id="an_28:15">28:15</span> A growling lion, and a ranging bear,
\[Is\] the wicked ruler over a poor people.

<span id="an_28:16">28:16</span> A leader lacking understanding
multiplieth oppressions, Whoso is hating dishonest gain prolongeth days.

<span id="an_28:17">28:17</span> A man oppressed with the blood of a
soul, Unto the pit fleeth, none taketh hold on him.

<span id="an_28:18">28:18</span> Whoso is walking uprightly is saved,
And the perverted of ways falleth at once.

<span id="an_28:19">28:19</span> Whoso is tilling his ground is
satisfied \[with\] bread, And whoso is pursuing vanity, Is filled
\[with\] poverty.

<span id="an_28:20">28:20</span> A stedfast man hath multiplied
blessings, And whoso is hasting to be rich is not acquitted.

<span id="an_28:21">28:21</span> To discern faces is not good, And for a
piece of bread doth a man transgress.

<span id="an_28:22">28:22</span> Troubled for wealth \[is\] the man
\[with\] an evil eye, And he knoweth not that want doth meet him.

<span id="an_28:23">28:23</span> Whoso is reproving a man afterwards
findeth grace, More than a flatterer with the tongue.

<span id="an_28:24">28:24</span> Whoso is robbing his father, or his
mother, And is saying, \`It is not transgression,' A companion he is to
a destroyer.

<span id="an_28:25">28:25</span> Whoso is proud in soul stirreth up
contention, And whoso is trusting on Jehovah is made fat.

<span id="an_28:26">28:26</span> Whoso is trusting in his heart is a
fool, And whoso is walking in wisdom is delivered.

<span id="an_28:27">28:27</span> Whoso is giving to the poor hath no
lack, And whoso is hiding his eyes multiplied curses.

<span id="an_28:28">28:28</span> In the rising of the wicked a man is
hidden, And in their destruction the righteous multiply!

<span id="an_29:1">29:1</span> A man often reproved, hardening the neck,
Is suddenly broken, and there is no healing.

<span id="an_29:2">29:2</span> In the multiplying of the righteous the
people rejoice, And in the ruling of the wicked the people sigh.

<span id="an_29:3">29:3</span> A man loving wisdom rejoiceth his father,
And a friend of harlots destroyeth wealth.

<span id="an_29:4">29:4</span> A king by judgment establisheth a land,
And one receiving gifts throweth it down.

<span id="an_29:5">29:5</span> A man taking a portion above his
neighbour, Spreadeth a net for his own steps.

<span id="an_29:6">29:6</span> In the transgression of the evil \[is\] a
snare, And the righteous doth sing and rejoice.

<span id="an_29:7">29:7</span> The righteous knoweth the plea of the
poor, The wicked understandeth not knowledge.

<span id="an_29:8">29:8</span> Men of scorning ensnare a city, And the
wise turn back anger.

<span id="an_29:9">29:9</span> A wise man is judged by the foolish man,
And he hath been angry, And he hath laughed, and there is no rest.

<span id="an_29:10">29:10</span> Men of blood hate the perfect, And the
upright seek his soul.

<span id="an_29:11">29:11</span> A fool bringeth out all his mind, And
the wise till afterwards restraineth it.

<span id="an_29:12">29:12</span> A ruler who is attending to lying
words, All his ministers \[are\] wicked.

<span id="an_29:13">29:13</span> The poor and the man of frauds have met
together, Jehovah is enlightening the eyes of them both.

<span id="an_29:14">29:14</span> a king that is judging truly the poor,
His throne for ever is established.

<span id="an_29:15">29:15</span> A rod and reproof give wisdom, And a
youth let away is shaming his mother.

<span id="an_29:16">29:16</span> In the multiplying of the wicked
transgression multiplieth, And the righteous on their fall do look.

<span id="an_29:17">29:17</span> Chastise thy son, and he giveth thee
comfort, Yea, he giveth delights to thy soul.

<span id="an_29:18">29:18</span> Without a Vision is a people made
naked, And whoso is keeping the law, O his happiness!

<span id="an_29:19">29:19</span> By words a servant is not instructed
though he understand, And there is nothing answering.

<span id="an_29:20">29:20</span> Thou hast seen a man hasty in his
words! More hope of a fool than of him.

<span id="an_29:21">29:21</span> Whoso is bringing up his servant
delicately, from youth, \[At\] his latter end also he is continuator.

<span id="an_29:22">29:22</span> An angry man stirreth up contention,
And a furious man is multiplying transgression.

<span id="an_29:23">29:23</span> The pride of man humbleth him, And
humility of spirit upholdeth honour.

<span id="an_29:24">29:24</span> Whoso is sharing with a thief is hating
his own soul, Execration he heareth, and telleth not.

<span id="an_29:25">29:25</span> Fear of man causeth a snare, And the
confident in Jehovah is set on high.

<span id="an_29:26">29:26</span> Many are seeking the face of a ruler,
And from Jehovah \[is\] the judgment of each.

<span id="an_29:27">29:27</span> An abomination to the righteous \[is\]
the perverse man, And an abomination to the wicked \[is\] the upright in
the way!

<span id="an_30:1">30:1</span> Words of a Gatherer, son of an obedient
one, the declaration, an affirmation of the man: -- I have wearied
myself \[for\] God, I have wearied myself \[for\] God, and am consumed.

<span id="an_30:2">30:2</span> For I am more brutish than any one, And
have not the understanding of a man.

<span id="an_30:3">30:3</span> Nor have I learned wisdom, Yet the
knowledge of Holy Ones I know.

<span id="an_30:4">30:4</span> Who went up to heaven, and cometh down?
Who hath gathered the wind in his fists? Who hath bound waters in a
garment? Who established all ends of the earth? What \[is\] His name?
and what His son's name? Surely thou knowest!

<span id="an_30:5">30:5</span> Every saying of God \[is\] tried, A
shield He \[is\] to those trusting in Him.

<span id="an_30:6">30:6</span> Add not to His words, lest He reason with
thee, And thou hast been found false.

<span id="an_30:7">30:7</span> Two things I have asked from Thee,
Withhold not from me before I die.

<span id="an_30:8">30:8</span> Vanity and a lying word put far from me,
Poverty or wealth give not to me, Cause me to eat the bread of my
portion,

<span id="an_30:9">30:9</span> Lest I become satiated, and have denied,
And have said, \`Who \[is\] Jehovah?' And lest I be poor, and have
stolen, And have laid hold of the name of my God.

<span id="an_30:10">30:10</span> Accuse not a servant unto his lord,
Lest he disesteem thee, and thou be found guilty.

<span id="an_30:11">30:11</span> A generation \[is\], that lightly
esteemeth their father, And their mother doth not bless.

<span id="an_30:12">30:12</span> A generation -- pure in their own eyes,
But from their own filth not washed.

<span id="an_30:13">30:13</span> A generation -- how high are their
eyes, Yea, their eyelids are lifted up.

<span id="an_30:14">30:14</span> A generation -- swords \[are\] their
teeth, And knives -- their jaw-teeth, To consume the poor from earth,
And the needy from \[among\] men.

<span id="an_30:15">30:15</span> To the leech \[are\] two daughters,
\`Give, give, Lo, three things are not satisfied, Four have not said
\`Sufficiency;'

<span id="an_30:16">30:16</span> Sheol, and a restrained womb, Earth --
it \[is\] not satisfied \[with\] water, And fire -- it hath not said,
\`Sufficiency,'

<span id="an_30:17">30:17</span> An eye that mocketh at a father, And
despiseth to obey a mother, Dig it out do ravens of the valley, And eat
it do young eagles.

<span id="an_30:18">30:18</span> Three things have been too wonderful
for me, Yea, four that I have not known:

<span id="an_30:19">30:19</span> The way of the eagle in the heavens,
The way of a serpent on a rock, The way of a ship in the heart of the
sea, And the way of a man in youth.

<span id="an_30:20">30:20</span> So -- the way of an adulterous woman,
She hath eaten and hath wiped her mouth, And hath said, \`I have not
done iniquity.'

<span id="an_30:21">30:21</span> For three things hath earth been
troubled, And for four -- it is not able to bear:

<span id="an_30:22">30:22</span> For a servant when he reigneth, And a
fool when he is satisfied with bread,

<span id="an_30:23">30:23</span> For a hated one when she ruleth, And a
maid-servant when she succeedeth her mistress.

<span id="an_30:24">30:24</span> Four \[are\] little ones of earth, And
they are made wiser than the wise:

<span id="an_30:25">30:25</span> The ants \[are\] a people not strong,
And they prepare in summer their food,

<span id="an_30:26">30:26</span> Conies \[are\] a people not strong, And
they place in a rock their house,

<span id="an_30:27">30:27</span> A king there is not to the locust, And
it goeth out -- each one shouting,

<span id="an_30:28">30:28</span> A spider with two hands taketh hold,
And is in the palaces of a king.

<span id="an_30:29">30:29</span> Three there are going well, Yea, four
are good in going:

<span id="an_30:30">30:30</span> An old lion -- mighty among beasts,
That turneth not back from the face of any,

<span id="an_30:31">30:31</span> A girt one of the loins, or a he-goat,
And a king -- no rising up with him.

<span id="an_30:32">30:32</span> If thou hast been foolish in lifting up
thyself, And if thou hast devised evil -- hand to mouth!

<span id="an_30:33">30:33</span> For the churning of milk bringeth out
butter, And the wringing of the nose bringeth out blood, And the forcing
of anger bringeth out strife!

<span id="an_31:1">31:1</span> Words of Lemuel a king, a declaration
that his mother taught him:

<span id="an_31:2">31:2</span> \`What, my son? and what, son of my womb?
And what, son of my vows?

<span id="an_31:3">31:3</span> Give not to women thy strength, And thy
ways to wiping away of kings.

<span id="an_31:4">31:4</span> Not for kings, O Lemuel, Not for kings,
to drink wine, And for princes a desire of strong drink.

<span id="an_31:5">31:5</span> Lest he drink, and forget the decree, And
change the judgment of any of the sons of affliction.

<span id="an_31:6">31:6</span> Give strong drink to the perishing, And
wine to the bitter in soul,

<span id="an_31:7">31:7</span> He drinketh, and forgetteth his poverty,
And his misery he remembereth not again.

<span id="an_31:8">31:8</span> Open thy mouth for the dumb, For the
right of all sons of change.

<span id="an_31:9">31:9</span> Open thy mouth, judge righteously, Both
the cause of the poor and needy!'

<span id="an_31:10">31:10</span> A woman of worth who doth find? Yea,
far above rubies \[is\] her price.

<span id="an_31:11">31:11</span> The heart of her husband hath trusted
in her, And spoil he lacketh not.

<span id="an_31:12">31:12</span> She hath done him good, and not evil,
All days of her life.

<span id="an_31:13">31:13</span> She hath sought wool and flax, And with
delight she worketh \[with\] her hands.

<span id="an_31:14">31:14</span> She hath been as ships of the merchant,
From afar she bringeth in her bread.

<span id="an_31:15">31:15</span> Yea, she riseth while yet night, And
giveth food to her household, And a portion to her damsels.

<span id="an_31:16">31:16</span> She hath considered a field, and taketh
it, From the fruit of her hands she hath planted a vineyard.

<span id="an_31:17">31:17</span> She hath girded with might her loins,
And doth strengthen her arms.

<span id="an_31:18">31:18</span> She hath perceived when her merchandise
\[is\] good, Her lamp is not extinguished in the night.

<span id="an_31:19">31:19</span> Her hands she hath sent forth on a
spindle, And her hands have held a distaff.

<span id="an_31:20">31:20</span> Her hand she hath spread forth to the
poor, Yea, her hands she sent forth to the needy.

<span id="an_31:21">31:21</span> She is not afraid of her household from
snow, For all her household are clothed \[with\] scarlet.

<span id="an_31:22">31:22</span> Ornamental coverings she hath made for
herself, Silk and purple \[are\] her clothing.

<span id="an_31:23">31:23</span> Known in the gates is her husband, In
his sitting with elders of the land.

<span id="an_31:24">31:24</span> Linen garments she hath made, and
selleth, And a girdle she hath given to the merchant.

<span id="an_31:25">31:25</span> Strength and honour \[are\] her
clothing, And she rejoiceth at a latter day.

<span id="an_31:26">31:26</span> Her mouth she hath opened in wisdom,
And the law of kindness \[is\] on her tongue.

<span id="an_31:27">31:27</span> She \[is\] watching the ways of her
household, And bread of sloth she eateth not.

<span id="an_31:28">31:28</span> Her sons have risen up, and pronounce
her happy, Her husband, and he praiseth her,

<span id="an_31:29">31:29</span> \`Many \[are\] the daughters who have
done worthily, Thou hast gone up above them all.'

<span id="an_31:30">31:30</span> The grace \[is\] false, and the beauty
\[is\] vain, A woman fearing Jehovah, she may boast herself.

<span id="an_31:31">31:31</span> Give ye to her of the fruit of her
hands, And her works do praise her in the gates!
