### Young's Literal Translation: Ezra

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> And in the first year of Cyrus king of
Persia, at the completion of the word of Jehovah from the mouth of
Jeremiah, hath Jehovah waked up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, and
he causeth an intimation to pass over into all his kingdom, and also in
writing, saying,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> \`Thus said Cyrus king of Persia, All
kingdoms of the earth hath Jehovah, God of the heavens, given to me, and
He hath laid a charge on me to build to Him a house in Jerusalem, that
\[is\] in Judah;

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> who \[is\] among you of all His people? His
God is with him, and he doth go up to Jerusalem, that \[is\] in Judah,
and build the house of Jehovah, God of Israel -- He \[is\] God -- that
\[is\] in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> \`And every one who is left, of any of the
places where he \[is\] a sojourner, assist him do the men of his place
with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, along with
a free-will offering for the house of God, that \[is\] in Jerusalem.'

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And heads of the fathers of Judah and
Benjamin rise, and the priests and the Levites, even every one whose
spirit God hath waked, to go up to build the house of Jehovah, that
\[is\] in Jerusalem;

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> and all those round about them have
strengthened \[them\] with their hands, with vessels of silver, with
gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, apart from
all that hath been offered willingly.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> And the king Cyrus hath brought out the
vessels of the house of Jehovah that Nebuchadnezzar hath brought out of
Jerusalem, and putteth them in the house of his gods;

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> yea, Cyrus king of Persia bringeth them out
by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbereth them to
Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> And this \[is\] their number: dishes of
gold thirty, dishes of silver a thousand, knives nine and twenty,

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> basins of gold thirty, basins of silver
(seconds) four hundred and ten, other vessels a thousand.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> All the vessels of gold and of silver
\[are\] five thousand and four hundred; the whole hath Sheshbazzar
brought up with the going up of the removal from Babylon to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> And these \[are\] sons of the province who
are going up -- of the captives of the removal that Nebuchadnezzar king
of Babylon removed to Babylon, and they turn back to Jerusalem and
Judah, each to his city --

those reckoning themselves by genealogy, and they have not been found,
and they are redeemed from the priesthood,

<span id="an_2:63">2:63</span> and the Tirshatha saith to them, that
they eat not of the most holy things till the standing up of a priest

<span id="an_2:64">2:64</span> All the assembly together \[is\] four

<span id="an_2:67">2:67</span> their camels, four hundred thirty and

<span id="an_2:68">2:68</span> And some of the heads of the fathers in
their coming in to the house of Jehovah that \[is\] in Jerusalem, have
offered willingly for the house of God, to establish it on its base;

<span id="an_2:69">2:69</span> according to their power they have given
to the treasure of the work; of gold, drams six myriads and a thousand,
and of silver, pounds five thousand, and of priests' coats, a hundred.

<span id="an_2:70">2:70</span> And the priests dwell, and the Levites,
and of the people, and the singers, and the gatekeepers, and the
Nethinim, in their cities; even all Israel in their cities.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> And the seventh month cometh, and the sons
of Israel \[are\] in the cities, and the people are gathered, as one
men, unto Jerusalem.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> And rise doth Jeshua son of Jozadak, and
his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and his
brethren, and they build the altar of the God of Israel, to cause to
ascend upon it burnt-offerings, as it is written in the law of Moses,
the man of God.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> And they establish the altar on its bases,
because of the fear upon them of the peoples of the lands, and he
causeth burnt-offerings to ascend upon it to Jehovah, burnt-offerings
for the morning and for the evening.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> And they make the feast of the booths as it
is written, and the burnt-offering of the day daily in number according
to the ordinance, the matter of a day in its day;

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> and after this a continual burnt-offering,
and for new moons, and for all appointed seasons of Jehovah that are
sanctified; and for every one who is willingly offering a
willing-offering to Jehovah.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> From the first day of the seventh month
they have begun to cause burnt-offerings to ascend to Jehovah, and the
temple of Jehovah hath not been founded,

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> and they give money to hewers and to
artificers, and food, and drink, and oil to Zidonians and to Tyrians, to
bring in cedar-trees from Lebanon unto the sea of Joppa, according to
the permission of Cyrus king of Persia concerning them.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> And in the second year of their coming in
unto the house of God, to Jerusalem, in the second month, began
Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua son of Jozadak, and the remnant
of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all those coming from
the captivity to Jerusalem, and they appoint the Levites from a son of
twenty years and upward, to overlook the work of the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> And Jeshua standeth, \[and\] his sons, and
his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, sons of Judah together, to overlook
those doing the work in the house of God; the sons of Henadad, \[and\]
their sons and their brethren the Levites.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> And those building have founded the
temple of Jehovah, and they appoint the priests, clothed, with trumpets,
and the Levites, sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise Jehovah, by
means of \[the instruments of\] David king of Israel.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> And they respond in praising and in
giving thanks to Jehovah, for good, for to the age His kindness \[is\]
over Israel, and all the people have shouted -- a great shout -- in
giving praise to Jehovah, because the house of Jehovah hath been
founded.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> And many of the priests, and the Levites,
and the heads of the fathers, the aged men who had seen the first house
-- in this house being founded before their eyes -- are weeping with a
loud voice, and many with a shout, in joy, lifting up the voice;

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> and the people are not discerning the
noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people,
for the people are shouting -- a great shout -- and the noise hath been
heard unto a distance.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> And adversaries of Judah and Benjamin hear
that the sons of the captivity are building a temple to Jehovah, God of
Israel,

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> and they draw nigh unto Zerubbabel, and
unto heads of the fathers, and say to them, \`Let us build with you;
for, like you, we seek to your God, and we are not sacrificing since the
days of Esar-Haddon king of Asshur, who brought us up hither.'

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> And Zerubbabel saith to them, also Jeshua,
and the rest of the heads of the fathers of Israel, \`Not for you, and
for us, to build a house to our God; but we ourselves together do build
to Jehovah God of Israel, as the king Cyrus, king of Persia, commanded
us.'

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> And it cometh to pass, the people of the
land are making the hands of the people of Judah feeble, and troubling
them in building,

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> and are hiring against them counsellors to
make void their counsel all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even till
the reign of Darius king of Persia.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the
commencement of his reign, they have written an accusation against the
inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem;

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> and in the days of Artaxerxes have Bishlam,
Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions written unto
Artaxerxes king of Persia, and the writing of the letter is written in
Aramaean, and interpreted in Aramaean.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> Rehum counsellor, and Shimshai scribe have
written a letter concerning Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king, thus:

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> Then Rehum counsellor, and Shimshai scribe,
and the rest of their companions, Dinaites, and Apharsathchites,
Tarpelites, Apharsites, Archevites, Babylonians, Susanchites, (who are
Elamites),

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> and the rest of the nations that the
great and honourable Asnapper removed and set in the city of Samaria,
and the rest beyond the river, and at such a time:

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> This \[is\] a copy of a letter that they
have sent unto him, unto Artaxerxes the king: \`Thy servants, men beyond
the river, and at such a time;

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> Be it known to the king, that the Jews
who have come up from thee unto us, have come in to Jerusalem, the
rebellious and base city they are building, and the walls they have
finished, and the foundations they join.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> \`Now, be it known to the king, that if
this city be builded, and the walls finished, toll, tribute, and custom
they do not give; and at length \[to\] the kings it doth cause loss.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> Now, because that the salt of the palace
\[is\] our salt, and the nakedness of the king we have no patience to
see, therefore we have sent and made known to the king;

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> so that he doth seek in the book of the
records of thy fathers, and thou dost find in the book of the records,
and dost know, that this city \[is\] a rebellious city, and causing loss
\[to\] kings and provinces, and makers of sedition \[are\] in its midst
from the days of old, therefore hath this city been wasted.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> We are making known to the king that, if
this city be builded and the walls finished, by this means a portion
beyond the river thou hast none.'

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> An answer hath the king sent unto Rehum
counsellor, and Shimshai scribe, and the rest of their companions who
are dwelling in Samaria, and the rest beyond the river, \`Peace, and at
such a time:

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> The letter that ye sent unto us,
explained, hath been read before me,

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> and by me a decree hath been made, and
they sought, and have found that this city from the days of old against
kings is lifting up itself, and rebellion and sedition is made in it,

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> and mighty kings have been over
Jerusalem, even rulers over all beyond the river, and toll, tribute, and
custom is given to them.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> \`Now, make ye a decree to cause these
men to cease, and this city is not builded, till by me a decree is made.

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> And beware ye of negligence in doing
this; why doth the hurt become great to the loss of the kings?'

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> Then from the time that a copy of the
letter of king Artaxerxes is read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe,
and their companions, they have gone in haste to Jerusalem, unto the
Jews, and caused them to cease by force and strength;

<span id="an_4:24">4:24</span> then ceased the service of the house of
God that \[is\] in Jerusalem, and it ceased till the second year of the
reign of Darius king of Persia.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> And prophesied have the prophets, (Haggai
the prophet, and Zechariah son of Iddo) unto the Jews who \[are\] in
Judah and in Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel -- unto them.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Then have Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and
Jeshua son of Jozadak, risen, and begun to build the house of God, that
\[is\] in Jerusalem, and with them are the prophets of God supporting
them.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> At that time come to them hath Tatnai,
governor beyond the river, and Shethar-Boznai, and their companions, and
thus they are saying to them, \`Who hath made for you a decree this
house to build, and this wall to finish?'

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> Then thus we have said to them, \`What
\[are\] the names of the men who are building this building?'

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> And the eye of their God hath been upon the
elders of the Jews, and they have not caused them to cease till the
matter goeth to Darius, and then they send back a letter concerning this
thing.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> The copy of a letter that Tatnai, governor
beyond the river, hath sent, and Shethar-Boznai and his companions, the
Apharsachites who \[are\] beyond the river, unto Darius the king.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> A letter they have sent unto him, and thus
is it written in it:

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> \`To Darius the king, all peace! be it
known to the king that we have gone to the province of Judah, to the
great house of God, and it is built \[with\] rolled stones, and wood is
placed in the walls, and this work is done speedily, and prospering in
their hand.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> Then we have asked of these elders, thus we
have said to them, Who hath made for you a decree this house to build,
and this wall to finish?

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> And also their names we have asked of
them, to let thee know, that we might write the names of the men who
\[are\] at their head.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> \`And thus they have returned us word,
saying, We \[are\] servants of the God of heaven and earth, and are
building the house that was built many years before this, that a great
king of Israel built and finished:

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> but after that our fathers made the God
of heaven angry, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon the Chaldean, and this house he destroyed, and the people he
removed to Babylon;

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> but in the first year of Cyrus king of
Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God,

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> and also, the vessels of the house of
God, of gold and silver, that Nebuchadnezzar had taken forth out of the
temple that \[is\] in Jerusalem, and brought them to the temple of
Babylon, them hath Cyrus the king brought forth out of the temple of
Babylon, and they have been given to \[one\], Sheshbazzar \[is\] his
name, whom he made governor,

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> and said to him, These vessels lift up,
go, put them down in the temple that \[is\] in Jerusalem, and the house
of God is builded on its place.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> Then hath this Sheshbazzar come -- he
hath laid the foundations of the house of God that \[is\] in Jerusalem,
and from thence even till now it hath been building, and is not
finished.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> \`And now, if to the king it be good, let
search be made in the treasure-house of the king, that \[is\] there in
Babylon, whether it be that of Cyrus the king there was made a decree to
build this house of God in Jerusalem, and the will of the king
concerning this thing he doth send unto us.'

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Then Darius the king made a decree, and
they sought in the house of the books of the treasuries placed there in
Babylon,

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> and there hath been found at Achmetha, in a
palace that \[is\] in the province of Media, a roll, and a record thus
written within it \[is\]:

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> \`In the first year of Cyrus the king,
Cyrus the king hath made a decree concerning the house of God in
Jerusalem: the house let be builded in the place where they are
sacrificing sacrifices, and its foundations strongly laid; its height
sixty cubits, its breadth sixty cubits;

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> three rows of rolled stones, and a row of
new wood, and the outlay let be given out of the king's house.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> \`And also, the vessels of the house of
God, of gold and silver, that Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the
temple that \[is\] in Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, let be given
back, and go to the temple that \[is\] in Jerusalem, \[each\] to its
place, and put \[them\] down in the house of God.

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> \`Now, Tatnai, governor beyond the river,
Shethar-Boznai, and their companions, the Apharsachites, who \[are\]
beyond the river, be ye far from hence;

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> let alone the work of this house of God,
let the governor of the Jews, and the elders of the Jews, build this
house of God on its place.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> \`And by me is made a decree concerning
that which ye do with the elders of these Jews to build this house of
God, that of the riches of the king, that \[are\] of the tribute beyond
the river, speedily let the outlay be given to these men, that they
cease not;

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> and what they are needing -- both young
bullocks, and rams, and lambs for burnt-offerings to the God of heaven,
wheat, salt, wine, and oil according to the saying of the priests who
\[are\] in Jerusalem -- let be given to them day by day without fail,

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> that they be bringing near sweet savours
to the God of heaven, and praying for the life of the king, and of his
sons.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> \`And by me is made a decree, that any
one who changeth this thing, let wood be pulled down from his house, and
being raised up, let him be smitten on it, and his house let be made a
dunghill for this.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> And God, who caused His name to dwell
there, doth cast down any king and people that putteth forth his hand to
change, to destroy this house of God that \[is\] in Jerusalem; I Darius
have made a decree; speedily let it be done.'

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> Then Tatnai, governor beyond the river,
Shethar-Boznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the
king hath sent, so they have done speedily;

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> and the elders of the Jews are building
and prospering through the prophecy of Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah
son of Iddo, and they have built and finished by the decree of the God
of Israel, and by the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king
of Persia.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> And this house hath gone out till the
third day of the month Adar, that is \[in\] the sixth year of the reign
of Darius the king.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> And the sons of Israel have made, \[and\]
the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the sons of the captivity,
a dedication of this house of God with joy,

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> and have brought near for the dedication
of this house of God, bullocks a hundred, rams two hundred, lambs four
hundred; and young he-goats for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve,
according to the number of the tribes of Israel;

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> and they have established the priests in
their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, over the service of
God that \[is\] in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> And the sons of the captivity make the
passover on the fourteenth of the first month,

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> for the priests and the Levites have been
purified together -- all of them \[are\] pure -- and they slaughter the
passover for all the sons of the captivity, and for their brethren the
priests, and for themselves.

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> And the sons of Israel, those returning
from the captivity, and every one who is separated from the uncleanness
of the nations of the land unto them, to seek to Jehovah, God of Israel,
do eat,

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> and they make the feast of unleavened
things seven days with joy, for Jehovah made them to rejoice, and turned
round the heart of the king of Asshur unto them, to strengthen their
hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> And after these things, in the reign of
Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of
Hilkiah,

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of
Ahitub,

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of
Meraioth,

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki,

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of
Eleazar, son of Aaron the head priest;

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> Ezra himself hath come up from Babylon, and
he \[is\] a scribe ready in the law of Moses, that Jehovah God of Israel
gave, and the king giveth to him -- according to the hand of Jehovah his
God upon him -- all his request.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> And there go up of the sons of Israel, and
of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the gatekeepers,
and the Nethinim, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the
king.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> And he cometh in to Jerusalem in the fifth
month, that \[is in\] the seventh year of the king,

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> for on the first of the month he hath
founded the ascent from Babylon, and on the first of the fifth month he
hath come in unto Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon
him,

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> for Ezra hath prepared his heart to seek
the law of Jehovah, and to do, and to teach in Israel statute and
judgment.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> And this \[is\] a copy of the letter that
the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, a scribe of the
words of the commands of Jehovah, and of His statutes on Israel:

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> \`Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the
priest, a perfect scribe of the law of the God of heaven, and at such a
time:

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> By me hath been made a decree that every
one who is willing, in my kingdom, of the people of Israel and of its
priests and Levites, to go to Jerusalem with thee, doth go;

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> because that from the king and his seven
counsellors thou art sent, to inquire concerning Judah and concerning
Jerusalem, with the law of God that \[is\] in thy hand,

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> and to carry silver and gold that the
king and his counsellors willingly offered to the God of Israel, whose
tabernacle \[is\] in Jerusalem,

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> and all the silver and gold that thou
findest in all the province of Babylon, with the free-will offerings of
the people, and of the priests, offering willingly, for the house of
their God that \[is\] in Jerusalem,

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> therefore thou dost speedily buy with
this money, bullocks, rams, lambs, and their presents, and their
libations, and dost bring them near to the altar of the house of your
God that \[is\] in Jerusalem,

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> and that which to thee and to thy
brethren is good to do with the rest of the silver and gold, according
to the will of your God ye do.'

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> \`And the vessels that are given to thee,
for the service of the house of thy God, make perfect before the God of
Jerusalem;

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> and the rest of the needful things of the
house of thy God, that it falleth to thee to give, thou dost give from
the treasure-house of the king.

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> \`And by me -- I Artaxerxes the king --
is made a decree to all treasurers who \[are\] beyond the river, that
all that Ezra the priest, scribe of the law of the God of heaven, doth
ask of you, be done speedily:

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> Unto silver a hundred talents, and unto
wheat a hundred cors, and unto wine a hundred baths, and unto oil a
hundred baths, and salt without reckoning;

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> all that \[is\] by the decree of the God
of heaven, let be done diligently for the house of the God of heaven;
for why is there wrath against the kingdom of the king and his sons?

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> \`And to you we are making known, that
upon any of the priests and Levites, singers, gatekeepers, Nethinim, and
servants of the house of God, tribute and custom there is no authority
to lift up.

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> \`And thou, Ezra, according to the wisdom
of thy God, that \[is\] in thy hand, appoint magistrates and judges who
may be judges to all the people who are beyond the river, to all knowing
the law of thy God, and he who hath not known ye cause to know;

<span id="an_7:26">7:26</span> and any who doth not do the law of thy
God, and the law of the king, speedily is judgment done upon him,
whether to death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of riches, and to
bonds.'

<span id="an_7:27">7:27</span> Blessed \[is\] Jehovah, God of our
fathers, who hath given such a thing as this in the heart of the king,
to beautify the house of Jehovah that \[is\] in Jerusalem,

<span id="an_7:28">7:28</span> and unto me hath stretched out kindness
before the king and his counsellors, and before all the mighty heads of
the king: and I have strengthened myself as the hand of Jehovah my God
\[is\] upon me, and I gather out of Israel heads to go up with me.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> And these \[are\] heads of their fathers,
and the genealogy of those going up with me, in the reign of Artaxerxes
the king, from Babylon.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> From the sons of Phinehas: Gershom; from
the sons of Ithamar: Daniel; from the sons of David: Hattush;

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> from the sons of Shechaniah, from the sons
of Pharosh: Zechariah, and with him, reckoning themselves by genealogy,
of males a hundred and fifty.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> From the sons of Pahath-Moab: Elihoenai son
of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred who are males.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> From the sons of Shechaniah: the son of
Jahaziel, and with him three hundred who are males.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> And from the sons of Adin: Ebed son of
Jonathan, and with him fifty who are males.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> And from the sons of Elam: Jeshaiah son of
Athaliah, and with him seventy who are males.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> And from the sons of Shephatiah: Zebadiah
son of Michael, and with him eighty who are males.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> From the sons of Joab: Obadiah son of
Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen who are males.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> And from the sons of Shelomith, the son
of Josiphiah, and with him a hundred and sixty who are males.

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> And from the sons of Bebai: Zechariah son
of Bebai, and with him twenty and eight who are males.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> And from the sons of Azgad: Johanan son
of Hakkatan, and with him a hundred and ten who are males.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> And from the younger sons of Adonikam --
and these \[are\] their names -- Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and
with them sixty who are males.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> And from the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and
Zabbud, and with them seventy who are males.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> And I gather them unto the river that is
going unto Ahava, and we encamp there three days; and I consider about
the people, and about the priests, and of the sons of Levi I have found
none there;

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> and I send for Eliezer, for Ariel, for
Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for
Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, heads, and for Joiarib,
and for Elnathan, men of understanding;

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> and I charge them for Iddo the head, in
the place Casiphia, and put in their mouth words to speak unto Iddo,
\[and\] his brethren the Nethinim, in the place Casiphia, to bring to us
ministrants for the house of our God.

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> And they bring to us, according to the
good hand of our God upon us, a man of understanding, of the sons of
Mahli, son of Levi, son of Israel, and Sherebiah, and his sons, and his
brethren, eighteen;

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah, of
the sons of Merari, his brethren, and their sons, twenty;

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> and from the Nethinim, whom David and the
heads gave for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty
Nethinim, all of them defined by name.

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> And I proclaim there a fast, by the river
Ahava, to afflict ourselves before our God, to seek from Him a right way
for us, and for our infants, and for all our substance,

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> for I was ashamed to ask from the king a
force and horsemen to help us because of the enemy in the way, for we
spake to the king, saying, \`The hand of our God \[is\] upon all seeking
Him for good, and His strength and His wrath \[is\] upon all forsaking
Him.'

<span id="an_8:23">8:23</span> And we fast, and seek from our God for
this, and He is entreated of us.

<span id="an_8:24">8:24</span> And I separate from the heads of the
priests, twelve, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and with them of their
brethren ten,

<span id="an_8:25">8:25</span> and I weigh to them the silver, and the
gold, and the vessels, a heave-offering of the house of our God, that
the king, and his counsellors, and his heads, and all Israel -- those
present -- lifted up;

<span id="an_8:26">8:26</span> and I weigh to their hand, of silver,
talents six hundred and fifty, and of vessels of silver a hundred
talents, of gold a hundred talents,

<span id="an_8:27">8:27</span> and basins of gold twenty, of a thousand
drams, and two vessels of good shining brass, desirable as gold.

<span id="an_8:28">8:28</span> And I say unto them, \`Ye \[are\] holy to
Jehovah, and the vessels \[are\] holy, and the silver and the gold
\[are\] a willing-offering to Jehovah, God of your fathers;

<span id="an_8:29">8:29</span> watch, and keep, till ye weigh before the
heads of the priests, and of the Levites, and the heads of the fathers
of Israel, in Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Jehovah.'

<span id="an_8:30">8:30</span> And the priests and the Levites took the
weight of the silver, and of the gold, and of the vessels, to bring to
Jerusalem to the house of our God.

<span id="an_8:31">8:31</span> And we journey from the river Ahava, on
the twelfth of the first month, to go to Jerusalem, and the hand of our
God hath been upon us, and He delivereth us from the hand of the enemy
and the lier in wait by the way;

<span id="an_8:32">8:32</span> and we come in to Jerusalem, and dwell
there three days.

<span id="an_8:33">8:33</span> And on the fourth day hath been weighed
the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, in the house of our God, unto
the hand of Meremoth son of Uriah the priest, and with him Eleazar son
of Phinehas, and with them Jozabad son of Jeshua, and Noadiah son of
Binnui, the Levites:

<span id="an_8:34">8:34</span> by number, by weight of every one, and
all the weight is written at that time.

<span id="an_8:35">8:35</span> Those coming in of the captives -- sons
of the removal -- have brought near burnt-offerings to the God of
Israel, bullocks twelve, for all Israel, rams ninety and six, lambs
seventy and seven, young he-goats for a sin-offering twelve -- the whole
a burnt-offering to Jehovah;

<span id="an_8:36">8:36</span> and they give the laws of the king to the
lieutenants of the king and the governors beyond the river, and they
have lifted up the people and the house of God.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> And at the completion of these things,
drawn nigh unto me have the heads, saying, \`The people of Israel, and
the priests, and the Levites, have not been separated from the peoples
of the lands, as to their abominations, even the Canaanite, the Hittite,
the Perizzite, the Jebusite, the Ammonite, the Moabite, the Egyptian,
and the Amorite,

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> for they have taken of their daughters to
them, and to their sons, and the holy seed have mingled themselves among
the peoples of the lands, and the hand of the heads and of the seconds
have been first in this trespass.'

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> And at my hearing this word, I have rent my
garment and my upper robe, and pluck out of the hair of my head, and of
my beard, and sit astonished,

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> and unto me are gathered every one
trembling at the words of the God of Israel, because of the trespass of
the removal, and I am sitting astonished till the present of the
evening.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> And at the present of the evening I have
risen from mine affliction, and at my rending my garment and my upper
robe, then I bow down on my knees, and spread out my hands unto Jehovah
my God,

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> and say, \`O my God, I have been ashamed,
and have blushed to lift up, O my God, my face unto Thee, for our
iniquities have increased over the head, and our guilt hath become great
unto the heavens.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> \`From the days of our fathers we \[are\]
in great guilt unto this day, and in our iniquities we have been given
-- we, our kings, our priests -- into the hand of the kings of the
lands, with sword, with captivity, and with spoiling, and with shame of
face, as \[at\] this day.

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> \`And now, as a small moment hath grace
been from Jehovah our God, to leave to us an escape, and to give to us a
nail in His holy place, by our God's enlightening our eyes, and by
giving us a little quickening in our servitude;

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> for servants we \[are\], and in our
servitude our God hath not forsaken us, and stretcheth out unto us
kindness before the kings of Persia, to give to us a quickening to lift
up the house of our God, and to cause its wastes to cease, and to give
to us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> \`And now, what do we say, O our God,
after this? for we have forsaken Thy commands,

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> that Thou hast commanded by the hands of
thy servants the prophets, saying, The land into which ye are going to
possess it, \[is\] a land of impurity, by the impurity of the people of
the lands, by their abominations with which they have filled it -- from
mouth unto mouth -- by their uncleanness;

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> and now, your daughters ye do not give to
their sons, and their daughters ye do not take to your sons, and ye do
not seek their peace, and their good -- unto the age, so that ye are
strong, and have eaten the good of the land, and given possession to
your sons unto the age.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> \`And after all that hath come upon us
for our evil works, and for our great guilt (for Thou, O our God, hast
kept back of the rod from our iniquities, and hast given to us an escape
like this),

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> do we turn back to break Thy commands,
and to join ourselves in marriage with the people of these abominations?
art not Thou angry against us -- even to consumption -- till there is no
remnant and escaped part?

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> \`O Jehovah, God of Israel, righteous
\[art\] Thou, for we have been left an escape, as \[it is\] this day;
lo, we \[are\] before Thee in our guilt, for there is none to stand
before Thee concerning this.'

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> And at Ezra's praying, and at his making
confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God,
there have been gathered unto him out of Israel an assembly very great
-- men and women and children -- for the people have wept, multiplying
weeping.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> And Shechaniah son of Jehiel, of the sons
of Elam, answereth and saith to Ezra, \`We -- we have trespassed against
our God, and we settle strange women of the peoples of the land; and now
there is hope for Israel concerning this,

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> and now, let us make a covenant with our
God, to cause all the women to go out, and that which is born of them,
by the counsel of the Lord, and of those trembling at the command of our
God, and according to law it is done;

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> rise, for on thee \[is\] the matter, and
we \[are\] with thee; be strong, and do.'

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> And Ezra riseth, and causeth the heads of
the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear to do according to
this word -- and they swear.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> And Ezra riseth from before the house of
God, and goeth unto the chamber of Jehohanan son of Eliashib; yea, he
goeth there, bread he hath not eaten, and water he hath not drunk, for
he is mourning because of the trespass of the removal.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> And they cause a voice to pass over into
Judah and Jerusalem, to all sons of the removal, to be gathered to
Jerusalem,

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> and every one who cometh not in by the
third day, according to the counsel of the heads and of the elders, all
his substance is devoted, and himself separated from the assembly of the
removal.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> And gathered are all the men of Judah and
Benjamin to Jerusalem by the third day, it \[is\] the ninth month, on
the twentieth of the month, and all the people sit in the broad place of
the house of God, trembling on account of the matter and of the showers.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> And Ezra the priest riseth, and saith
unto them, \`Ye -- ye have trespassed, and ye settle strange women, to
add to the guilt of Israel;

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> and, now, make confession to Jehovah,
God of your fathers, and do His good pleasure, and be separated from the
peoples of the land, and from the strange women.'

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> And all the assembly answer and say
\[with\] a great voice, \`Right; according to thy word -- on us to do;

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> but the people \[are\] many, and \[it
is\] the time of showers, and there is no power to stand without, and
the work \[is\] not for one day, nor for two, for we have multiplied to
transgress in this thing.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> \`Let, we pray thee, our heads of all
the assembly stand, and all who \[are\] in our cities, who have settled
strange wives, do come in at the times appointed, and with them the
elders of city and city, and its judges, till the turning back of the
fury of the wrath of our God from us, for this thing.'

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> Only Jonathan son of Asahel, and
Jahaziah son of Tikvah, stood against this, and Meshullam, and
Shabbethai the Levite, helped them.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> And the sons of the removal do so, and
Ezra the priest, \[and\] men, heads of the fathers, for the house of
their fathers, are separated, even all of them by name, and they sit on
the first day of the tenth month, to examine the matter;

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> and they finish with all the men who
have settled strange women unto the first day of the first month.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> And there are found of the sons of the
priests that have settled strange women: of the sons of Jeshua son of
Jozadak, and his brethren, Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and
Gedaliah;

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> and they give their hand to send out
their wives, and, being guilty, a ram of the flock, for their guilt.

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> And of the sons of Immer: Hanani and
Zebadiah;

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> and of the sons of Harim: Masseiah, and
Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah;

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> and of the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai,
Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah.

<span id="an_10:23">10:23</span> And of the Levites: Jozabad, and

Eliezer.

the gatekeepers: Shallum, and Telem, and Uri.

<span id="an_10:25">10:25</span> And of Israel: of the sons of Parosh:
Ramiah, and Jeziah, and Malchijah, and Miamin, and Eleazar, and
Malchijah, and Benaiah.

<span id="an_10:26">10:26</span> And of the sons of Elam: Mattaniah,
Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Elijah.

<span id="an_10:27">10:27</span> And of the sons of Zattu: Elioenai,
Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza.

<span id="an_10:28">10:28</span> And of the sons of Bebai: Jehohanan,
Hananiah, Zabbai, Athlai.

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> And of the sons of Bani: Meshullam,
Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and Sheal, and Ramoth.

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> And of the sons of Pahath-Moab: Adna,
and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezaleel, and Binnui, and
Manasseh.
