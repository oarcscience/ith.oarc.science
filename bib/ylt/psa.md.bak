### Young's Literal Translation: Psalms

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> O the happiness of that one, who Hath not
walked in the counsel of the wicked. And in the way of sinners hath not
stood, And in the seat of scorners hath not sat;

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> But -- in the law of Jehovah \[is\] his
delight, And in His law he doth meditate by day and by night:

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> And he hath been as a tree, Planted by
rivulets of water, That giveth its fruit in its season, And its leaf
doth not wither, And all that he doth he causeth to prosper.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> Not so the wicked: But -- as chaff that
wind driveth away!

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Therefore the wicked rise not in judgment,
Nor sinners in the company of the righteous,

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> For Jehovah is knowing the way of the
righteous, And the way of the wicked is lost!

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Why have nations tumultuously assembled?
And do peoples meditate vanity?

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> Station themselves do kings of the earth,
And princes have been united together, Against Jehovah, and against His
Messiah:

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> \`Let us draw off Their cords, And cast
from us Their thick bands.'

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> He who is sitting in the heavens doth
laugh, The Lord doth mock at them.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Then doth He speak unto them in His anger,
And in His wrath He doth trouble them:

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> \`And I -- I have anointed My King, Upon
Zion -- My holy hill.'

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> I declare concerning a statute: Jehovah
said unto me, \`My Son Thou \[art\], I to-day have brought thee forth.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Ask of Me and I give nations -- thy
inheritance, And thy possession -- the ends of earth.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> Thou dost rule them with a sceptre of iron,
As a vessel of a potter Thou dost crush them.'

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> And now, O kings, act wisely, Be
instructed, O judges of earth,

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> Serve ye Jehovah with fear, And rejoice
with trembling.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> Kiss the Chosen One, lest He be angry,
And ye lose the way, When His anger burneth but a little, O the
happiness of all trusting in Him!

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> A Psalm of David, in his fleeing from the
face of Absalom his son. Jehovah, how have my distresses multiplied!
Many are rising up against me.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> Many are saying of my soul, \`There is no
salvation for him in God.' Selah.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> And Thou, O Jehovah, \[art\] a shield for
me, My honour, and lifter up of my head.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> My voice \[is\] unto Jehovah: I call: And
He answereth me from his holy hill, Selah.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> I -- I have lain down, and I sleep, I have
waked, for Jehovah sustaineth me.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> I am not afraid of myriads of people, That
round about they have set against me.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Rise, O Jehovah! save me, my God. Because
Thou hast smitten All mine enemies \[on\] the cheek. The teeth of the
wicked Thou hast broken.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Of Jehovah \[is\] this salvation; On Thy
people \[is\] Thy blessing! Selah.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> To the Overseer with Stringed Instruments.
-- A Psalm of David. In my calling answer Thou me, O God of my
righteousness. In adversity Thou gavest enlargement to me; Favour me,
and hear my prayer.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> Sons of men! till when \[is\] my glory for
shame? Ye love a vain thing, ye seek a lie. Selah.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> And know ye that Jehovah Hath separated a
saintly one to Himself. Jehovah heareth in my calling to Him.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> \`Tremble ye, and do not sin;' Say ye
\[thus\] in your heart on your bed, And be ye silent. Selah.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Sacrifice ye sacrifices of righteousness,
And trust ye unto Jehovah.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> Many are saying, \`Who doth show us good?'
Lift on us the light of Thy face, O Jehovah,

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> Thou hast given joy in my heart, From the
time their corn and their wine Have been multiplied.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> In peace together I lie down and sleep, For
Thou, O Jehovah, alone, In confidence dost cause me to dwell!

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> To the Overseer, \`Concerning the
Inheritances.' -- A Psalm of David. My sayings hear, O Jehovah, Consider
my meditation.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Be attentive to the voice of my cry, My
king and my God, For unto Thee I pray habitually.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> Jehovah, \[at\] morning Thou hearest my
voice, \[At\] morning I set in array for Thee, And I look out.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> For not a God desiring wickedness \[art\]
Thou, Evil inhabiteth Thee not.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> The boastful station not themselves before
Thine eyes: Thou hast hated all working iniquity.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> Thou destroyest those speaking lies, A man
of blood and deceit Jehovah doth abominate.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> And I, in the abundance of Thy kindness, I
enter Thy house, I bow myself toward Thy holy temple in Thy fear.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> O Jehovah, lead me in Thy righteousness,
Because of those observing me, Make straight before me Thy way,

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> For there is no stability in their mouth.
Their heart \[is\] mischiefs, An open grave \[is\] their throat, Their
tongue they make smooth.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> Declare them guilty, O God, Let them fall
from their own counsels, In the abundance of their transgressions Drive
them away, Because they have rebelled against Thee.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> And rejoice do all trusting in Thee, To
the age they sing, and Thou coverest them over, And those loving Thy
name exult in Thee.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> For Thou blessest the righteous, O
Jehovah, As a buckler with favour dost compass him!

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> To the Overseer with stringed instruments,
on the octave. -- A Psalm of David. O Jehovah, in Thine anger reprove me
not, Nor in Thy fury chastise me.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Favour me, O Jehovah, for I \[am\] weak,
Heal me, O Jehovah, For troubled have been my bones,

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> And my soul hath been troubled greatly, And
Thou, O Jehovah, till when?

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> Turn back, O Jehovah, draw out my soul,
Save me for Thy kindness' sake.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> For there is not in death Thy memorial, In
Sheol, who doth give thanks to Thee?

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> I have been weary with my sighing, I
meditate through all the night \[on\] my bed, With my tear my couch I
waste.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> Old from provocation is mine eye, It is old
because of all mine adversaries,

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> Turn from me all ye workers of iniquity,
For Jehovah heard the voice of my weeping,

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> Jehovah hath heard my supplication, Jehovah
my prayer receiveth.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> Ashamed and troubled greatly are all mine
enemies, They turn back -- ashamed \[in\] a moment!

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> \`The Erring One,' by David, that he sung
to Jehovah concerning the words of Cush a Benjamite. O Jehovah, my God,
in Thee I have trusted, Save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> Lest he tear as a lion my soul, Rending,
and there is no deliverer.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> O Jehovah, my God, if I have done this, If
there is iniquity in my hands,

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> If I have done my well-wisher evil, And
draw mine adversary without cause,

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> An enemy pursueth my soul, and overtaketh,
And treadeth down to the earth my life, And my honour placeth in the
dust. Selah.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> Rise, O Jehovah, in Thine anger, Be lifted
up at the wrath of mine adversaries, And awake Thou for me: Judgment
Thou hast commanded:

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> And a company of peoples compass Thee, And
over it on high turn Thou back,

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> Jehovah doth judge the peoples; Judge me, O
Jehovah, According to my righteousness, And according to mine integrity
on me,

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> Let, I pray Thee be ended the evil of the
wicked, And establish Thou the righteous, And a trier of hearts and
reins is the righteous God.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> My shield \[is\] on God, Saviour of the
upright in heart!

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> God \[is\] a righteous judge, And He is
not angry at all times.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> If \[one\] turn not, His sword he
sharpeneth, His bow he hath trodden -- He prepareth it,

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> Yea, for him He hath prepared Instruments
of death, His arrows for burning pursuers He maketh.

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> Lo, he travaileth \[with\] iniquity, And
he hath conceived perverseness, And hath brought forth falsehood.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> A pit he hath prepared, and he diggeth
it, And he falleth into a ditch he maketh.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> Return doth his perverseness on his head,
And on his crown his violence cometh down.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> I thank Jehovah, According to His
righteousness, And praise the name of Jehovah Most High!

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> To the Overseer, \`On the Gittith.' A Psalm
of David. Jehovah, our Lord, How honourable Thy name in all the earth!
Who settest thine honour on the heavens.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> From the mouths of infants and sucklings
Thou hast founded strength, Because of Thine adversaries, To still an
enemy and a self-avenger.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> For I see Thy heavens, a work of Thy
fingers, Moon and stars that Thou didst establish.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> What \[is\] man that Thou rememberest him?
The son of man that Thou inspectest him?

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> And causest him to lack a little of
Godhead, And with honour and majesty compassest him.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> Thou dost cause him to rule Over the works
of Thy hands, All Thou hast placed under his feet.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> Sheep and oxen, all of them, And also
beasts of the field,

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> Bird of the heavens, and fish of the sea,
Passing through the paths of the seas!

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> Jehovah, our Lord, How honourable Thy name
in all the earth!

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> To the Overseer, \`On the Death of Labben.'
-- A Psalm of David. I confess, O Jehovah, with all my heart, I recount
all Thy wonders,

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> I rejoice and exult in Thee, I praise Thy
Name, O Most High.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> In mine enemies turning backward, they
stumble and perish from Thy face.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> For Thou hast done my judgment and my
right. Thou hast sat on a throne, A judge of righteousness.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> Thou hast rebuked nations, Thou hast
destroyed the wicked, Their name Thou hast blotted out to the age and
for ever.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> O thou Enemy, Finished have been
destructions for ever, As to cities thou hast plucked up, Perished hath
their memorial with them.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> And Jehovah to the age abideth, He is
preparing for judgment His throne.

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> And He judgeth the world in righteousness,
He judgeth the peoples in uprightness.

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> And Jehovah is a tower for the bruised, A
tower for times of adversity.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> They trust in Thee who do know Thy name,
For Thou hast not forsaken Those seeking Thee, O Jehovah.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> Sing ye praise to Jehovah, inhabiting
Zion, Declare ye among the peoples His acts,

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> For He who is seeking for blood Them hath
remembered, He hath not forgotten the cry of the afflicted.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> Favour me, O Jehovah, See mine affliction
by those hating me, Thou who liftest me up from the gates of death,

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> So that I recount all Thy praise, In the
gates of the daughter of Zion. I rejoice on Thy salvation.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> Sunk have nations in a pit they made, In
a net that they hid hath their foot been captured.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> Jehovah hath been known, Judgment He hath
done, By a work of his hands Hath the wicked been snared. Meditation.
Selah.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> The wicked do turn back to Sheol, All
nations forgetting God.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> For not for ever is the needy forgotten,
The hope of the humble lost to the age.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> Rise, O Jehovah, let not man be strong,
Let nations be judged before Thy face.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> Appoint, O Jehovah, a director to them,
Let nations know they \[are\] men! Selah.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> Why, Jehovah, dost Thou stand at a
distance? Thou dost hide in times of adversity,

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> Through the pride of the wicked, Is the
poor inflamed, They are caught in devices that they devised.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> Because the wicked hath boasted Of the
desire of his soul, And a dishonest gainer he hath blessed, He hath
despised Jehovah.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> The wicked according to the height of his
face, inquireth not. \`God is not!' \[are\] all his devices.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> Pain do his ways at all times, On high
\[are\] Thy judgments before him, All his adversaries -- he puffeth at
them.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> He hath said in his heart, \`I am not
moved,' To generation and generation not in evil.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> Of oaths his mouth is full, And deceits,
and fraud: Under his tongue \[is\] perverseness and iniquity,

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> He doth sit in an ambush of the villages,
In secret places he doth slay the innocent. His eyes for the afflicted
watch secretly,

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> He lieth in wait in a secret place, as a
lion in a covert. He lieth in wait to catch the poor, He catcheth the
poor, drawing him into his net.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> He is bruised -- he boweth down, Fallen
by his mighty ones hath the afflicted.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> He said in his heart, \`God hath
forgotten, He hath hid His face, He hath never seen.'

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> Arise, O Jehovah! O God, lift up Thy
hand! Forget not the humble.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> Wherefore hath the wicked despised God?
He hath said in his heart, \`It is not required.'

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> Thou hast seen, For Thou perverseness
and anger beholdest; By giving into Thy hand, On Thee doth the afflicted
leave \[it\], Of the fatherless Thou hast been an helper.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> Break the arm of the wicked and the
evil, Seek out his wickedness, find none;

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> Jehovah \[is\] king to the age, and for
ever, The nations have perished out of His land!

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> The desire of the humble Thou hast
heard, O Jehovah. Thou preparest their heart; Thou causest Thine ear to
attend,

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> To judge the fatherless and bruised: He
addeth no more to oppress -- man of the earth!

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> To the Overseer. -- By David. In Jehovah
I trusted, how say ye to my soul, \`They moved \[to\] Thy mountain for
the bird?

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> For lo, the wicked tread a bow, They have
prepared their arrow on the string, To shoot in darkness at the upright
in heart.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> When the foundations are destroyed, The
righteous -- what hath he done?

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> \`Jehovah \[is\] in his holy temple:
Jehovah -- in the heavens \[is\] His throne. His eyes see -- His eyelids
try the sons of men.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> Jehovah the righteous doth try. And the
wicked and the lover of violence, Hath His soul hated,

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> He poureth on the wicked snares, fire,
and brimstone, And a horrible wind \[is\] the portion of their cup.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> For righteous \[is\] Jehovah,
Righteousness He hath loved, The upright doth His countenance see!'

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> To the Overseer, on the octave. -- A
Psalm of David. Save, Jehovah, for the saintly hath failed, For the
stedfast have ceased From the sons of men:

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> Vanity they speak each with his
neighbour, Lip of flattery! With heart and heart they speak.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> Jehovah doth cut off all lips of
flattery, A tongue speaking great things,

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> Who said, \`By our tongue we do mightily:
Our lips \[are\] our own; who \[is\] lord over us?'

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> Because of the spoiling of the poor,
Because of the groaning of the needy, Now do I arise, saith Jehovah, I
set in safety \[him who\] doth breathe for it.

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> Sayings of Jehovah \[are\] pure sayings;
Silver tried in a furnace of earth refined sevenfold.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> Thou, O Jehovah, dost preserve them, Thou
keepest us from this generation to the age.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> Around the wicked walk continually,
According as vileness is exalted by sons of men!

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David.
Till when, O Jehovah, Dost Thou forget me? -- for ever? Till when dost
Thou hide Thy face from me?

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> Till when do I set counsels in my soul?
Sorrow inn my heart daily? Till when is mine enemy exalted over me?

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> Look attentively; Answer me, O Jehovah,
my God, Enlighten mine eyes, lest I sleep in death,

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> Lest mine enemy say, \`I overcame him,'
Mine adversaries joy when I am moved.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> And I, in Thy kindness I have trusted,
Rejoice doth my heart in Thy salvation.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> I do sing to Jehovah, For He hath
conferred benefits upon me!

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> To the Overseer. -- By David. A fool hath
said in his heart, \`God is not;' They have done corruptly, They have
done abominable actions, There is not a doer of good.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> Jehovah from the heavens Hath looked on
the sons of men, To see if there is a wise one -- seeking God.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> The whole have turned aside, Together
they have been filthy: There is not a doer of good, not even one.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> Have all working iniquity not known?
Those consuming my people have eaten bread, Jehovah they have not
called.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> There they have feared a fear, For God
\[is\] in the generation of the righteous.

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> The counsel of the poor ye cause to
stink, Because Jehovah \[is\] his refuge.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> \`Who doth give from Zion the salvation
of Israel? When Jehovah doth turn back \[To\] a captivity of His people,
Jacob doth rejoice -- Israel is glad!

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> A Psalm of David. Jehovah, who doth
sojourn in Thy tent? Who doth dwell in Thy holy hill?

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> He who is walking uprightly, And working
righteousness, And speaking truth in his heart.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> He hath not slandered by his tongue, He
hath not done to his friend evil; And reproach he hath not lifted up
Against his neighbour.

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> Despised in his eyes \[is\] a rejected
one, And those fearing Jehovah he doth honour. He hath sworn to suffer
evil, and changeth not;

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> His silver he hath not given in usury,
And a bribe against the innocent Hath not taken; Whoso is doing these is
not moved to the age!

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> A Secret Treasure of David. Preserve me,
O God, for I did trust in Thee.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> Thou hast said to Jehovah, \`My Lord Thou
\[art\];' My good \[is\] not for thine own sake;

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> For the holy ones who \[are\] in the
land, And the honourable, all my delight \[is\] in them.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> Multiplied are their griefs, \[Who\] have
hastened backward; I pour not out their libations of blood, Nor do I
take up their names on my lips.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> Jehovah \[is\] the portion of my share,
and of my cup, Thou -- Thou dost uphold my lot.

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> Lines have fallen to me in pleasant
places, Yea, a beauteous inheritance \[is\] for me.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> I bless Jehovah who hath counselled me;
Also \[in\] the nights my reins instruct me.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> I did place Jehovah before me
continually, Because -- at my right hand I am not moved.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> Therefore hath my heart been glad, And my
honour doth rejoice, Also my flesh dwelleth confidently:

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> For Thou dost not leave my soul to
Sheol, Nor givest thy saintly one to see corruption.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> Thou causest me to know the path of
life; Fulness of joys \[is\] with Thy presence, Pleasant things by Thy
right hand for ever!

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> A Prayer of David. Hear, O Jehovah,
righteousness, attend my cry, Give ear \[to\] my prayer, without lips of
deceit.

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> From before thee my judgment doth go out;
Thine eyes do see uprightly.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> Thou hast proved my heart, Thou hast
inspected by night, Thou hast tried me, Thou findest nothing; My
thoughts pass not over my mouth.

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> As to doings of man, Through a word of
Thy lips I have observed The paths of a destroyer;

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> To uphold my goings in Thy paths, My
steps have not slidden.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> I -- I called Thee, for Thou dost answer
me, O God, incline Thine ear to me, hear my speech.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> Separate wonderfully Thy kindness, O
Saviour of the confiding, By Thy right hand, from withstanders.

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> Keep me as the apple, the daughter of the
eye; In shadow of Thy wings thou dost hide me.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> From the face of the wicked who spoiled
me. Mine enemies in soul go round against me.

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> Their fat they have closed up, Their
mouths have spoken with pride:

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> \`Our steps now have compassed
\[him\];' Their eyes they set to turn aside in the land.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> His likeness as a lion desirous to
tear, As a young lion dwelling in secret places.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> Arise, O Jehovah, go before his face,
Cause him to bend. Deliver my soul from the wicked, Thy sword,

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> From men, Thy hand, O Jehovah, From men
of the world, their portion \[is\] in life, And \[with\] Thy hidden
things Thou fillest their belly, They are satisfied \[with\] sons; And
have left their abundance to their sucklings.

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> I -- in righteousness, I see Thy face;
I am satisfied, in awaking, \[with\] Thy form!

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> To the Overseer. -- By a servant of
Jehovah, by David, who hath spoken to Jehovah the words of this song in
the day Jehovah delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from
the hand of Saul, and he saith: -- I love Thee, O Jehovah, my strength.

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> Jehovah \[is\] my rock, and my bulwark,
And my deliverer, My God \[is\] my rock, I trust in Him: My shield, and
a horn of my salvation, My high tower.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> The \`Praised One' I call Jehovah, And
from my enemies I am saved.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> Compassed me have cords of death, And
streams of the worthless make me afraid.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> Cords of Sheol have surrounded me, Before
me have been snares of death.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> In mine adversity I call Jehovah, And
unto my God I cry. He heareth from His temple my voice, And My cry
before Him cometh into His ears.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> And shake and tremble doth the earth, And
foundations of hills are troubled, And they shake -- because He hath
wrath.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> Gone up hath smoke by His nostrils, And
fire from His mouth consumeth, Coals have been kindled by it.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> And He inclineth the heavens, and cometh
down, And thick darkness \[is\] under His feet.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> And He rideth on a cherub, and doth
fly, And He flieth on wings of wind.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> He maketh darkness His secret place,
Round about Him His tabernacle, Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the
skies.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> From the brightness over-against Him
His thick clouds have passed on, Hail and coals of fire.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> And thunder in the heavens doth
Jehovah, And the Most High giveth forth His voice, Hail and coals of
fire.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> And He sendeth His arrows and
scattereth them, And much lightning, and crusheth them.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> And seen are the streams of waters, And
revealed are foundations of the earth. From Thy rebuke, O Jehovah, From
the breath of the spirit of Thine anger.

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> He sendeth from above -- He taketh me,
He draweth me out of many waters.

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> He delivereth me from my strong enemy,
And from those hating me, For they have been stronger than I.

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> They go before me in a day of my
calamity And Jehovah is for a support to me.

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> And He bringeth me forth to a large
place, He draweth me out, because He delighted in me.

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> Jehovah doth recompense me According to
my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands, He doth return
to me.

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> For I have kept the ways of Jehovah,
And have not done wickedly against my God.

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> For all His judgments \[are\] before
me, And His statutes I turn not from me.

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> And I am perfect with him, And I keep
myself from mine iniquity.

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> And Jehovah doth return to me,
According to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands,
Over-against his eyes.

<span id="an_18:25">18:25</span> With the kind Thou showest Thyself
kind, With a perfect man showest Thyself perfect.

<span id="an_18:26">18:26</span> With the pure Thou showest Thyself
pure, And with the perverse showest Thyself a wrestler,

<span id="an_18:27">18:27</span> For Thou a poor people savest, And the
eyes of the high causest to fall.

<span id="an_18:28">18:28</span> For Thou -- Thou lightest my lamp,
Jehovah my God enlighteneth my darkness.

<span id="an_18:29">18:29</span> For by Thee I run -- a troop! And by my
God I leap a wall.

<span id="an_18:30">18:30</span> God! perfect \[is\] His way, The saying
of Jehovah is tried, A shield \[is\] He to all those trusting in Him.

<span id="an_18:31">18:31</span> For who \[is\] God besides Jehovah? And
who \[is\] a rock save our God?

<span id="an_18:32">18:32</span> God! who is girding me \[with\]
strength, And He maketh perfect my way.

<span id="an_18:33">18:33</span> Making my feet like hinds, And on my
high places causeth me to stand.

<span id="an_18:34">18:34</span> Teaching my hands for battle, And a bow
of brass was brought down by my arms.

<span id="an_18:35">18:35</span> And Thou givest to me the shield of Thy
salvation, And Thy right hand doth support me, And Thy lowliness maketh
me great.

<span id="an_18:36">18:36</span> Thou enlargest my step under me, And
mine ankles have not slidden.

<span id="an_18:37">18:37</span> I pursue mine enemies, and overtake
them, And turn back not till they are consumed.

<span id="an_18:38">18:38</span> I smite them, and they are not able to
rise, They fall under my feet,

<span id="an_18:39">18:39</span> And Thou girdest me \[with\] strength
for battle, Causest my withstanders to bow under me.

<span id="an_18:40">18:40</span> As to mine enemies -- Thou hast given
to me the neck, As to those hating me -- I cut them off.

<span id="an_18:41">18:41</span> They cry, and there is no saviour, On
Jehovah, and He doth not answer them.

<span id="an_18:42">18:42</span> And I beat them as dust before wind, As
mire of the streets I empty them out.

<span id="an_18:43">18:43</span> Thou dost deliver me From the strivings
of the people, Thou placest me for a head of nations, A people I have
not known do serve me.

<span id="an_18:44">18:44</span> At the hearing of the ear they hearken
to me, Sons of a stranger feign obedience to me,

<span id="an_18:45">18:45</span> Sons of a stranger fade away, And are
slain out of their close places.

<span id="an_18:46">18:46</span> Jehovah liveth -- and blessed \[is\] my
rock, And exalted is the God of my salvation.

<span id="an_18:47">18:47</span> God -- who is giving vengeance to me,
And He subdueth peoples under me,

<span id="an_18:48">18:48</span> My deliverer from mine enemies, Above
my withstanders Thou raisest me, From a man of violence dost deliver me.

<span id="an_18:49">18:49</span> Therefore I confess Thee among nations,
O Jehovah, And to Thy name I sing praise,

<span id="an_18:50">18:50</span> Magnifying the salvation of His king,
And doing kindness to His anointed, To David, and to his seed -- unto
the age!

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. The
heavens \[are\] recounting the honour of God, And the work of His hands
The expanse \[is\] declaring.

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> Day to day uttereth speech, And night to
night sheweth knowledge.

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> There is no speech, and there are no
words. Their voice hath not been heard.

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> Into all the earth hath their line gone
forth, And to the end of the world their sayings, For the sun He placed
a tent in them,

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> And he, as a bridegroom, goeth out from
his covering, He rejoiceth as a mighty one To run the path.

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> From the end of the heavens \[is\] his
going out, And his revolution \[is\] unto their ends, And nothing is hid
from his heat.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> The law of Jehovah \[is\] perfect,
refreshing the soul, The testimonies of Jehovah \[are\] stedfast, Making
wise the simple,

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> The precepts of Jehovah \[are\] upright,
Rejoicing the heart, The command of Jehovah \[is\] pure, enlightening
the eyes,

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> The fear of Jehovah \[is\] clean,
standing to the age, The judgments of Jehovah \[are\] true, They have
been righteous -- together.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> They are more desirable than gold, Yea,
than much fine gold; and sweeter than honey, Even liquid honey of the
comb.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> Also -- Thy servant is warned by them,
\`In keeping them \[is\] a great reward.'

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> Errors! who doth understand? From
hidden ones declare me innocent,

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> Also -- from presumptuous ones keep
back Thy servant, Let them not rule over me, Then am I perfect, And
declared innocent of much transgression,

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> Let the sayings of my mouth, And the
meditation of my heart, Be for a pleasing thing before Thee, O Jehovah,
my rock, and my redeemer!

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David.
Jehovah doth answer thee, In a day of adversity, The name of the God of
Jacob doth set thee on high,

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> He doth send thy help from the sanctuary,
And from Zion doth support thee,

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> He doth remember all thy presents, And
thy burnt-offering doth reduce to ashes. Selah.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> He doth give to thee according to thy
heart, And all thy counsel doth fulfil.

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> We sing of thy salvation, And in the name
of our God set up a banner. Jehovah doth fulfil all thy requests.

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> Now I have known That Jehovah hath saved
His anointed, He answereth him from His holy heavens, With the saving
might of His right hand.

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> Some of chariots, and some of horses, And
we of the name of Jehovah our God Make mention.

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> They -- they have bowed and have fallen,
And we have risen and station ourselves upright.

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> O Jehovah, save the king, He doth answer
us in the day we call!

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David.
Jehovah, in Thy strength is the king joyful, In Thy salvation how
greatly he rejoiceth.

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> The desire of his heart Thou gavest to
him, And the request of his lips Thou hast not withheld. Selah.

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> For Thou puttest before him blessings of
goodness, Thou settest on his head a crown of fine gold.

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> Life he hath asked from Thee, Thou hast
given to him -- length of days, Age-during -- and for ever.

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> Great \[is\] his honour in Thy salvation,
Honour and majesty Thou placest on him.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> For Thou makest him blessings for ever,
Thou dost cause him to rejoice with joy, By Thy countenance.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> For the king is trusting in Jehovah, And
in the kindness of the Most High He is not moved.

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> Thy hand cometh to all Thine enemies, Thy
right hand doth find Thy haters.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> Thou makest them as a furnace of fire, At
the time of Thy presence. Jehovah in His anger doth swallow them, And
fire doth devour them.

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> Their fruit from earth Thou destroyest,
And their seed from the sons of men.

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> For they stretched out against Thee
evil, They devised a wicked device, they prevail not,

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> For Thou makest them a butt, When Thy
strings Thou preparest against their faces.

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> Be Thou exalted, O Jehovah in, Thy
strength, We sing and we praise Thy might!

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> To the Overseer, on \`The Hind of the
Morning.' -- A Psalm of David. My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken
me? Far from my salvation, The words of my roaring?

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> My God, I call by day, and Thou answerest
not, And by night, and there is no silence to me.

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> And Thou \[art\] holy, Sitting -- the
Praise of Israel.

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> In Thee did our fathers trust -- they
trusted, And Thou dost deliver them.

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> Unto Thee they cried, and were delivered,
In Thee they trusted, and were not ashamed.

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> And I \[am\] a worm, and no man, A
reproach of man, and despised of the people.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> All beholding me do mock at me, They make
free with the lip -- shake the head,

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> \`Roll unto Jehovah, He doth deliver him,
He doth deliver him, for he delighted in him.'

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> For thou \[art\] He bringing me forth
from the womb, Causing me to trust, On the breasts of my mother.

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> On Thee I have been cast from the womb,
From the belly of my mother Thou \[art\] my God.

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> Be not far from me, For adversity is
near, for there is no helper.

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> Many bulls have surrounded me, Mighty
ones of Bashan have compassed me,

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> They have opened against me their
mouth, A lion tearing and roaring.

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> As waters I have been poured out, And
separated themselves have all my bones, My heart hath been like wax, It
is melted in the midst of my bowels.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> Dried up as an earthen vessel is my
power, And my tongue is cleaving to my jaws.

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> And to the dust of death thou
appointest me, For surrounded me have dogs, A company of evil doers have
compassed me, Piercing my hands and my feet.

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> I count all my bones -- they look
expectingly, They look upon me,

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> They apportion my garments to
themselves, And for my clothing they cause a lot to fall.

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> And Thou, O Jehovah, be not far off, O
my strength, to help me haste.

<span id="an_22:20">22:20</span> Deliver from the sword my soul, From
the paw of a dog mine only one.

<span id="an_22:21">22:21</span> Save me from the mouth of a lion: --
And -- from the horns of the high places Thou hast answered me!

<span id="an_22:22">22:22</span> I declare Thy name to my brethren, In
the midst of the assembly I praise Thee.

<span id="an_22:23">22:23</span> Ye who fear Jehovah, praise ye Him, All
the seed of Jacob, honour ye Him, And be afraid of Him, all ye seed of
Israel.

<span id="an_22:24">22:24</span> For He hath not despised, nor
abominated, The affliction of the afflicted, Nor hath He hidden His face
from him, And in his crying unto Him He heareth.

<span id="an_22:25">22:25</span> Of Thee my praise \[is\] in the great
assembly. My vows I complete before His fearers.

<span id="an_22:26">22:26</span> The humble do eat and are satisfied,
Praise Jehovah do those seeking Him, Your heart doth live for ever.

<span id="an_22:27">22:27</span> Remember and return unto Jehovah, Do
all ends of the earth, And before Thee bow themselves, Do all families
of the nations,

<span id="an_22:28">22:28</span> For to Jehovah \[is\] the kingdom, And
He is ruling among nations.

<span id="an_22:29">22:29</span> And the fat ones of earth have eaten,
And they bow themselves, Before Him bow do all going down to dust, And
he \[who\] hath not revived his soul.

<span id="an_22:30">22:30</span> A seed doth serve Him, It is declared
of the Lord to the generation.

<span id="an_22:31">22:31</span> They come and declare His
righteousness, To a people that is borne, that He hath made!

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> A Psalm of David. Jehovah \[is\] my
shepherd, I do not lack,

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> In pastures of tender grass He causeth me
to lie down, By quiet waters He doth lead me.

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> My soul He refresheth, He leadeth me in
paths of righteousness, For His name's sake,

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> Also -- when I walk in a valley of
death-shade, I fear no evil, for Thou \[art\] with me, Thy rod and Thy
staff -- they comfort me.

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> Thou arrangest before me a table,
Over-against my adversaries, Thou hast anointed with oil my head, My cup
is full!

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> Only -- goodness and kindness pursue me,
All the days of my life, And my dwelling \[is\] in the house of Jehovah,
For a length of days!

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> A Psalm of David. To Jehovah \[is\] the
earth and its fulness, The world and the inhabitants in it.

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> For He on the seas hath founded it, And
on the floods He doth establish it.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> Who goeth up into the hill of Jehovah?
And who riseth up in His holy place?

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> The clean of hands, and pure of heart,
Who hath not lifted up to vanity his soul, Nor hath sworn to deceit.

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> He beareth away a blessing from Jehovah,
Righteousness from the God of his salvation.

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> This \[is\] a generation of those seeking
Him. Seeking Thy face, O Jacob! Selah.

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> Lift up, O gates, your heads, And be
lifted up, O doors age-during, And come in doth the king of glory!

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> Who \[is\] this -- \`the king of glory?'
Jehovah -- strong and mighty, Jehovah, the mighty in battle.

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> Lift up, O gates, your heads, And be
lifted up, O doors age-during, And come in doth the king of glory!

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> Who \[is\] He -- this \`king of glory?'
Jehovah of hosts -- He \[is\] the king of glory! Selah.

<span id="an_25:1">25:1</span> By David. Unto Thee, O Jehovah, my soul I
lift up.

<span id="an_25:2">25:2</span> My God, in Thee I have trusted, Let me
not be ashamed, Let not mine enemies exult over me.

<span id="an_25:3">25:3</span> Also let none waiting on Thee be ashamed,
Let the treacherous dealers without cause be ashamed.

<span id="an_25:4">25:4</span> Thy ways, O Jehovah, cause me to know,
Thy paths teach Thou me.

<span id="an_25:5">25:5</span> Cause me to tread in Thy truth, and teach
me, For Thou \[art\] the God of my salvation, Near Thee I have waited
all the day.

<span id="an_25:6">25:6</span> Remember Thy mercies, O Jehovah, And Thy
kindnesses, for from the age \[are\] they.

<span id="an_25:7">25:7</span> Sins of my youth, and my transgressions,
Do not Thou remember. According to Thy kindness be mindful of me, For
Thy goodness' sake, O Jehovah.

<span id="an_25:8">25:8</span> Good and upright \[is\] Jehovah,
Therefore He directeth sinners in the way.

<span id="an_25:9">25:9</span> He causeth the humble to tread in
judgment, And teacheth the humble His way.

<span id="an_25:10">25:10</span> All the paths of Jehovah \[are\]
kindness and truth, To those keeping His covenant, And His testimonies.

<span id="an_25:11">25:11</span> For Thy name's sake, O Jehovah, Thou
hast pardoned mine iniquity, for it \[is\] great.

<span id="an_25:12">25:12</span> Who \[is\] this -- the man fearing
Jehovah? He directeth him in the way He doth choose.

<span id="an_25:13">25:13</span> His soul in good doth remain, And his
seed doth possess the land.

<span id="an_25:14">25:14</span> The secret of Jehovah \[is\] for those
fearing Him, And His covenant -- to cause them to know.

<span id="an_25:15">25:15</span> Mine eyes \[are\] continually unto
Jehovah, For He bringeth out from a net my feet.

<span id="an_25:16">25:16</span> Turn Thou unto me, and favour me, For
lonely and afflicted \[am\] I.

<span id="an_25:17">25:17</span> The distresses of my heart have
enlarged themselves, From my distresses bring me out.

<span id="an_25:18">25:18</span> See mine affliction and my misery, And
bear with all my sins.

<span id="an_25:19">25:19</span> See my enemies, for they have been
many, And with violent hatred they have hated me.

<span id="an_25:20">25:20</span> Keep my soul, and deliver me, Let me
not be ashamed, for I trusted in Thee.

<span id="an_25:21">25:21</span> Integrity and uprightness do keep me,
For I have waited \[on\] Thee.

<span id="an_25:22">25:22</span> Redeem Israel, O God, from all his
distresses!

<span id="an_26:1">26:1</span> By David. Judge me, O Jehovah, for I in
mine integrity have walked, And in Jehovah I have trusted, I slide not.

<span id="an_26:2">26:2</span> Try me, O Jehovah, and prove me, Purified
\[are\] my reins and my heart.

<span id="an_26:3">26:3</span> For Thy kindness \[is\] before mine eyes,
And I have walked habitually in Thy truth.

<span id="an_26:4">26:4</span> I have not sat with vain men, And with
dissemblers I enter not.

<span id="an_26:5">26:5</span> I have hated the assembly of evil doers,
And with the wicked I sit not.

<span id="an_26:6">26:6</span> I wash in innocency my hands, And I
compass Thine altar, O Jehovah.

<span id="an_26:7">26:7</span> To sound with a voice of confession, And
to recount all Thy wonders.

<span id="an_26:8">26:8</span> Jehovah, I have loved the habitation of
Thy house, And the place of the tabernacle of Thine honour.

<span id="an_26:9">26:9</span> Do not gather with sinners my soul, And
with men of blood my life,

<span id="an_26:10">26:10</span> In whose hand \[is\] a wicked device,
And their right hand \[is\] full of bribes.

<span id="an_26:11">26:11</span> And I, in mine integrity I walk, Redeem
me, and favour me.

<span id="an_26:12">26:12</span> My foot hath stood in uprightness, In
assemblies I bless Jehovah!

<span id="an_27:1">27:1</span> By David. Jehovah \[is\] my light and my
salvation, Whom do I fear? Jehovah \[is\] the strength of my life, Of
whom am I afraid?

<span id="an_27:2">27:2</span> When evil doers come near to me to eat my
flesh, My adversaries and mine enemies to me, They have stumbled and
fallen.

<span id="an_27:3">27:3</span> Though a host doth encamp against me, My
heart doth not fear, Though war riseth up against me, In this I \[am\]
confident.

<span id="an_27:4">27:4</span> One \[thing\] I asked of Jehovah -- it I
seek. My dwelling in the house of Jehovah, All the days of my life, To
look on the pleasantness of Jehovah, And to inquire in His temple.

<span id="an_27:5">27:5</span> For He hideth me in a tabernacle in the
day of evil, He hideth me in a secret place of His tent, On a rock he
raiseth me up.

<span id="an_27:6">27:6</span> And now, lifted up is my head, Above my
enemies -- my surrounders, And I sacrifice in His tent sacrifices of
shouting, I sing, yea, I sing praise to Jehovah.

<span id="an_27:7">27:7</span> Hear, O Jehovah, my voice -- I call, And
favour me, and answer me.

<span id="an_27:8">27:8</span> To Thee said my heart \`They sought my
face, Thy face, O Jehovah, I seek.'

<span id="an_27:9">27:9</span> Hide not Thy face from me, Turn not aside
in anger Thy servant, My help Thou hast been. Leave me not, nor forsake
me, O God of my salvation.

<span id="an_27:10">27:10</span> When my father and my mother Have
forsaken me, then doth Jehovah gather me.

<span id="an_27:11">27:11</span> Shew me, O Jehovah, Thy way, And lead
me in a path of uprightness, For the sake of my beholders.

<span id="an_27:12">27:12</span> Give me not to the will of my
adversaries, For risen against me have false witnesses, And they breathe
out violence to me.

<span id="an_27:13">27:13</span> I had not believed to look on the
goodness of Jehovah In the land of the living!

<span id="an_27:14">27:14</span> Look unto Jehovah -- be strong, And He
doth strengthen thy heart, Yea, look unto Jehovah!

<span id="an_28:1">28:1</span> By David. Unto Thee, O Jehovah, I call,
My rock, be not silent to me! Lest Thou be silent to me, And I have been
compared With those going down to the pit.

<span id="an_28:2">28:2</span> Hear the voice of my supplications, In my
crying unto Thee, In my lifting up my hands toward thy holy oracle.

<span id="an_28:3">28:3</span> Draw me not with the wicked, And with
workers of iniquity, Speaking peace with their neighbours, And evil in
their heart.

<span id="an_28:4">28:4</span> Give to them according to their acting,
And according to the evil of their doings. According to the work of
their hands give to them. Return their deed to them.

<span id="an_28:5">28:5</span> For they attend not to the doing of
Jehovah, And unto the work of His hands. He throweth them down, And doth
not build them up.

<span id="an_28:6">28:6</span> Blessed \[is\] Jehovah, For He hath heard
the voice of my supplications.

<span id="an_28:7">28:7</span> Jehovah \[is\] my strength, and my
shield, In Him my heart trusted, and I have been helped. And my heart
exulteth, And with my song I thank Him.

<span id="an_28:8">28:8</span> Jehovah \[is\] strength to him, Yea, the
strength of the salvation of His anointed \[is\] He.

<span id="an_28:9">28:9</span> Save Thy people, and bless Thine
inheritance, And feed them, and carry them to the age!

<span id="an_29:1">29:1</span> A Psalm of David. Ascribe to Jehovah, ye
sons of the mighty, Ascribe to Jehovah honour and strength.

<span id="an_29:2">29:2</span> Ascribe to Jehovah the honour of His
name, Bow yourselves to Jehovah, In the beauty of holiness.

<span id="an_29:3">29:3</span> The voice of Jehovah \[is\] on the
waters, The God of glory hath thundered, Jehovah \[is\] on many waters.

<span id="an_29:4">29:4</span> The voice of Jehovah \[is\] with power,
The voice of Jehovah \[is\] with majesty,

<span id="an_29:5">29:5</span> The voice of Jehovah \[is\] shivering
cedars, Yea, Jehovah shivers the cedars of Lebanon.

<span id="an_29:6">29:6</span> And He causeth them to skip as a calf,
Lebanon and Sirion as a son of Reems,

<span id="an_29:7">29:7</span> The voice of Jehovah is hewing fiery
flames,

<span id="an_29:8">29:8</span> The voice of Jehovah paineth a
wilderness, Jehovah paineth the wilderness of Kadesh.

<span id="an_29:9">29:9</span> The voice of Jehovah paineth the oaks,
And maketh bare the forests, And in His temple every one saith,
\`Glory.'

<span id="an_29:10">29:10</span> Jehovah on the deluge hath sat, And
Jehovah sitteth king -- to the age,

<span id="an_29:11">29:11</span> Jehovah strength to his people giveth,
Jehovah blesseth His people with peace!

<span id="an_30:1">30:1</span> A Psalm. -- A song of the dedication of
the house of David. I exalt Thee, O Jehovah, For Thou hast drawn me up,
and hast not let mine enemies rejoice over me.

<span id="an_30:2">30:2</span> Jehovah my God, I have cried to Thee, And
Thou dost heal me.

<span id="an_30:3">30:3</span> Jehovah, Thou hast brought up from Sheol
my soul, Thou hast kept me alive, From going down \[to\] the pit.

<span id="an_30:4">30:4</span> Sing praise to Jehovah, ye His saints,
And give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness,

<span id="an_30:5">30:5</span> For -- a moment \[is\] in His anger, Life
\[is\] in His good-will, At even remaineth weeping, and at morn singing.

<span id="an_30:6">30:6</span> And I -- I have said in mine ease, \`I am
not moved -- to the age.

<span id="an_30:7">30:7</span> O Jehovah, in Thy good pleasure, Thou
hast caused strength to remain for my mountain,' Thou hast hidden Thy
face -- I have been troubled.

<span id="an_30:8">30:8</span> Unto Thee, O Jehovah, I call, And unto
Jehovah I make supplication.

<span id="an_30:9">30:9</span> \`What gain \[is\] in my blood? In my
going down unto corruption? Doth dust thank Thee? doth it declare Thy
truth?

<span id="an_30:10">30:10</span> Hear, O Jehovah, and favour me, O
Jehovah, be a helper to me.'

<span id="an_30:11">30:11</span> Thou hast turned my mourning to dancing
for me, Thou hast loosed my sackcloth, And girdest me \[with\] joy.

<span id="an_30:12">30:12</span> So that honour doth praise Thee, and is
not silent, O Jehovah, my God, to the age I thank Thee!

<span id="an_31:1">31:1</span> To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. In
Thee, O Jehovah, I have trusted, Let me not be ashamed to the age, In
Thy righteousness deliver me.

<span id="an_31:2">31:2</span> Incline unto me Thine ear hastily,
deliver me, Be to me for a strong rock, For a house of bulwarks to save
me.

<span id="an_31:3">31:3</span> For my rock and my bulwark \[art\] Thou,
For Thy name's sake lead me and tend me.

<span id="an_31:4">31:4</span> Bring me out from the net that they hid
for me, For Thou \[art\] my strength.

<span id="an_31:5">31:5</span> Into Thy hand I commit my spirit, Thou
hast redeemed me, Jehovah God of truth.

<span id="an_31:6">31:6</span> I have hated the observers of lying
vanities, And I toward Jehovah have been confident.

<span id="an_31:7">31:7</span> I rejoice, and am glad in Thy kindness,
In that Thou hast seen mine affliction, Thou hast known in adversities
my soul.

<span id="an_31:8">31:8</span> And Thou hast not shut me up, Into the
hand of an enemy, Thou hast caused my feet to stand in a broad place.

<span id="an_31:9">31:9</span> Favour me, O Jehovah, for distress \[is\]
to me, Mine eye, my soul, and my body Have become old by provocation.

<span id="an_31:10">31:10</span> For my life hath been consumed in
sorrow And my years in sighing. Feeble because of mine iniquity hath
been my strength, And my bones have become old.

<span id="an_31:11">31:11</span> Among all mine adversaries I have been
a reproach, And to my neighbours exceedingly, And a fear to mine
acquaintances, Those seeing me without -- fled from me.

<span id="an_31:12">31:12</span> I have been forgotten as dead out of
mind, I have been as a perishing vessel.

<span id="an_31:13">31:13</span> For I have heard an evil account of
many, Fear \[is\] round about. In their being united against me, To take
my life they have devised,

<span id="an_31:14">31:14</span> And I on Thee -- I have trusted, O
Jehovah, I have said, \`Thou \[art\] my God.'

<span id="an_31:15">31:15</span> In Thy hand \[are\] my times, Deliver
me from the hand of my enemies, And from my pursuers.

<span id="an_31:16">31:16</span> Cause Thy face to shine on Thy servant,
Save me in Thy kindness.

<span id="an_31:17">31:17</span> O Jehovah, let me not be ashamed, For I
have called Thee, let the wicked be ashamed, Let them become silent to
Sheol.

<span id="an_31:18">31:18</span> Let lips of falsehood become dumb, That
are speaking against the righteous, Ancient sayings, in pride and
contempt.

<span id="an_31:19">31:19</span> How abundant is Thy goodness, That Thou
hast laid up for those fearing Thee,

<span id="an_31:20">31:20</span> Thou hast wrought for those trusting in
Thee, Before sons of men. Thou hidest them in the secret place of Thy
presence, From artifices of man, Thou concealest them in a tabernacle,
From the strife of tongues.

<span id="an_31:21">31:21</span> Blessed \[is\] Jehovah, For He hath
made marvellous His kindness To me in a city of bulwarks.

<span id="an_31:22">31:22</span> And I -- I have said in my haste, \`I
have been cut off from before Thine eyes,' But Thou hast heard the voice
of my supplications, In my crying unto Thee.

<span id="an_31:23">31:23</span> Love Jehovah, all ye His saints,
Jehovah is keeping the faithful, And recompensing abundantly a proud
doer.

<span id="an_31:24">31:24</span> Be strong, and He strengtheneth your
heart, All ye who are waiting for Jehovah!

<span id="an_32:1">32:1</span> By David. -- An Instruction. O the
happiness of him whose transgression \[is\] forgiven, Whose sin is
covered.

<span id="an_32:2">32:2</span> O the happiness of a man, To whom Jehovah
imputeth not iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no deceit.

<span id="an_32:3">32:3</span> When I have kept silence, become old have
my bones, Through my roaring all the day.

<span id="an_32:4">32:4</span> When by day and by night Thy hand is
heavy upon me, My moisture hath been changed Into the droughts of
summer. Selah.

<span id="an_32:5">32:5</span> My sin I cause Thee to know, And mine
iniquity I have not covered. I have said, \`I confess concerning My
transgressions to Jehovah,' And Thou -- Thou hast taken away, The
iniquity of my sin. Selah.

<span id="an_32:6">32:6</span> For this doth every saintly one pray to
Thee, As the time to find. Surely at an overflowing of many waters, Unto
him they come not.

<span id="an_32:7">32:7</span> Thou \[art\] a hiding-place for me, From
distress Thou dost keep me, \[With\] songs of deliverance dost compass
me. Selah.

<span id="an_32:8">32:8</span> I cause thee to act wisely, And direct
thee in the way that thou goest, I cause mine eye to take counsel
concerning thee.

<span id="an_32:9">32:9</span> Be ye not as a horse -- as a mule,
Without understanding, With bridle and bit, its ornaments, to curb, Not
to come near unto thee.

<span id="an_32:10">32:10</span> Many \[are\] the pains of the wicked;
As to him who is trusting in Jehovah, Kindness doth compass him.

<span id="an_32:11">32:11</span> Be glad in Jehovah, and rejoice, ye
righteous, And sing, all ye upright of heart!

<span id="an_33:1">33:1</span> Sing, ye righteous, in Jehovah, For
upright ones praise \[is\] comely.

<span id="an_33:2">33:2</span> Give ye thanks to Jehovah with a harp,
With psaltery of ten strings sing praise to Him,

<span id="an_33:3">33:3</span> Sing ye to Him a new song, Play skilfully
with shouting.

<span id="an_33:4">33:4</span> For upright \[is\] the word of Jehovah,
And all His work \[is\] in faithfulness.

<span id="an_33:5">33:5</span> Loving righteousness and judgment, Of the
kindness of Jehovah is the earth full.

<span id="an_33:6">33:6</span> By the word of Jehovah The heavens have
been made, And by the breath of His mouth all their host.

<span id="an_33:7">33:7</span> Gathering as a heap the waters of the
sea, Putting in treasuries the depths.

<span id="an_33:8">33:8</span> Afraid of Jehovah are all the earth, Of
Him are all the inhabitants of the world afraid.

<span id="an_33:9">33:9</span> For He hath said, and it is, He hath
commanded, and it standeth.

<span id="an_33:10">33:10</span> Jehovah made void the counsel of
nations, He disallowed the thoughts of the peoples.

<span id="an_33:11">33:11</span> The counsel of Jehovah to the age
standeth, The thoughts of His heart to all generations.

<span id="an_33:12">33:12</span> O the happiness of the nation whose God
\[is\] Jehovah, Of the people He did choose, For an inheritance to Him.

<span id="an_33:13">33:13</span> From the heavens hath Jehovah looked,
He hath seen all the sons of men.

<span id="an_33:14">33:14</span> From the fixed place of His dwelling,
He looked unto all inhabitants of the earth;

<span id="an_33:15">33:15</span> Who is forming their hearts together,
Who is attending unto all their works.

<span id="an_33:16">33:16</span> The king is not saved by the multitude
of a force. A mighty man is not delivered, By abundance of power.

<span id="an_33:17">33:17</span> A false thing \[is\] the horse for
safety, And by the abundance of his strength He doth not deliver.

<span id="an_33:18">33:18</span> Lo, the eye of Jehovah \[is\] to those
fearing Him, To those waiting for His kindness,

<span id="an_33:19">33:19</span> To deliver from death their soul, And
to keep them alive in famine.

<span id="an_33:20">33:20</span> Our soul hath waited for Jehovah, Our
help and our shield \[is\] He,

<span id="an_33:21">33:21</span> For in Him doth our heart rejoice, For
in His holy name we have trusted.

<span id="an_33:22">33:22</span> Let Thy kindness, O Jehovah, be upon
us, As we have waited for Thee!

<span id="an_34:1">34:1</span> By David, in his changing his behaviour
before Abimelech, and he driveth him away, and he goeth. I do bless
Jehovah at all times, Continually His praise \[is\] in my mouth.

<span id="an_34:2">34:2</span> In Jehovah doth my soul boast herself,
Hear do the humble and rejoice.

<span id="an_34:3">34:3</span> Ascribe ye greatness to Jehovah with me,
And we exalt His name together.

<span id="an_34:4">34:4</span> I sought Jehovah, and He answered me, And
from all my fears did deliver me.

<span id="an_34:5">34:5</span> They looked expectingly unto Him, And
they became bright, And their faces are not ashamed.

<span id="an_34:6">34:6</span> This poor \[one\] called, and Jehovah
heard, And from all his distresses saved him.

<span id="an_34:7">34:7</span> A messenger of Jehovah is encamping,
Round about those who fear Him, And He armeth them.

<span id="an_34:8">34:8</span> Taste ye and see that Jehovah \[is\]
good, O the happiness of the man who trusteth in Him.

<span id="an_34:9">34:9</span> Fear Jehovah, ye His holy ones, For there
is no lack to those fearing Him.

<span id="an_34:10">34:10</span> Young lions have lacked and been
hungry, And those seeking Jehovah lack not any good,

<span id="an_34:11">34:11</span> Come ye, children, hearken to me, The
fear of Jehovah I do teach you.

<span id="an_34:12">34:12</span> Who \[is\] the man that is desiring
life? Loving days to see good?

<span id="an_34:13">34:13</span> Keep thy tongue from evil, And thy lips
from speaking deceit.

<span id="an_34:14">34:14</span> Turn aside from evil and do good, Seek
peace and pursue it.

<span id="an_34:15">34:15</span> The eyes of Jehovah \[are\] unto the
righteous, And His ears unto their cry.

<span id="an_34:16">34:16</span> (The face of Jehovah \[is\] on doers of
evil, To cut off from earth their memorial.)

<span id="an_34:17">34:17</span> They cried, and Jehovah heard, And from
all their distresses delivered them.

<span id="an_34:18">34:18</span> Near \[is\] Jehovah to the broken of
heart, And the bruised of spirit He saveth.

<span id="an_34:19">34:19</span> Many \[are\] the evils of the
righteous, Out of them all doth Jehovah deliver him.

<span id="an_34:20">34:20</span> He is keeping all his bones, One of
them hath not been broken.

<span id="an_34:21">34:21</span> Evil doth put to death the wicked, And
those hating the righteous are desolate.

<span id="an_34:22">34:22</span> Jehovah redeemeth the soul of His
servants, And none trusting in Him are desolate!

<span id="an_35:1">35:1</span> By David. Strive, Jehovah, with my
strivers, fight with my fighters,

<span id="an_35:2">35:2</span> Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise
for my help,

<span id="an_35:3">35:3</span> And draw out spear and lance, To meet my
pursuers. Say to my soul, \`Thy salvation I \[am\].'

<span id="an_35:4">35:4</span> They are ashamed and blush, those seeking
my soul, Turned backward and confounded, Those devising my evil.

<span id="an_35:5">35:5</span> They are as chaff before wind, And a
messenger of Jehovah driving away.

<span id="an_35:6">35:6</span> Their way is darkness and slipperiness,
And a messenger of Jehovah their pursuer.

<span id="an_35:7">35:7</span> For without cause they hid for me their
netpit, Without cause they digged for my soul.

<span id="an_35:8">35:8</span> Meet him doth desolation -- he knoweth
not, And his net that he hid catcheth him, For desolation he falleth
into it.

<span id="an_35:9">35:9</span> And my soul is joyful in Jehovah, It
rejoiceth in His salvation.

<span id="an_35:10">35:10</span> All my bones say, \`Jehovah, who is
like Thee, Delivering the poor from the stronger than he, And the poor
and needy from his plunderer.'

<span id="an_35:11">35:11</span> Violent witnesses rise up, That which I
have not known they ask me.

<span id="an_35:12">35:12</span> They pay me evil for good, bereaving my
soul,

<span id="an_35:13">35:13</span> And I -- in their sickness my clothing
\[is\] sackcloth, I have humbled with fastings my soul, And my prayer
unto my bosom returneth.

<span id="an_35:14">35:14</span> As \[if\] a friend, as \[if\] my
brother, I walked habitually, As a mourner for a mother, Mourning I have
bowed down.

<span id="an_35:15">35:15</span> And -- in my halting they have
rejoiced, And have been gathered together, Gathered against me were the
smiters, And I have not known, They have rent, and they have not ceased;

<span id="an_35:16">35:16</span> With profane ones, mockers in feasts,
Gnashing against me their teeth.

<span id="an_35:17">35:17</span> Lord, how long dost thou behold? Keep
back my soul from their desolations, From young lions my only one.

<span id="an_35:18">35:18</span> I thank Thee in a great assembly, Among
a mighty people I praise Thee.

<span id="an_35:19">35:19</span> Mine enemies rejoice not over me
\[with\] falsehood, Those hating me without cause wink the eye.

<span id="an_35:20">35:20</span> For they speak not peace, And against
the quiet of the land, Deceitful words they devise,

<span id="an_35:21">35:21</span> And they enlarge against me their
mouth, They said, \`Aha, aha, our eye hath seen.'

<span id="an_35:22">35:22</span> Thou hast seen, O Jehovah, Be not
silent, O Lord -- be not far from me,

<span id="an_35:23">35:23</span> Stir up, and wake to my judgment, My
God, and my Lord, to my plea.

<span id="an_35:24">35:24</span> Judge me according to Thy
righteousness, O Jehovah my God, And they do not rejoice over me.

<span id="an_35:25">35:25</span> They do not say in their heart, \`Aha,
our desire.' They do not say, \`We swallowed him up.'

<span id="an_35:26">35:26</span> They are ashamed and confounded
together, Who are rejoicing at my evil. They put on shame and confusion,
Who are magnifying themselves against me.

<span id="an_35:27">35:27</span> They sing and rejoice, who are desiring
my righteousness, And they say continually, \`Jehovah is magnified, Who
is desiring the peace of His servant.'

<span id="an_35:28">35:28</span> And my tongue uttereth Thy
righteousness, All the day Thy praise!

<span id="an_36:1">36:1</span> To the Overseer. -- By a servant of
Jehovah, by David. The transgression of the wicked Is affirming within
my heart, \`Fear of God is not before his eyes,

<span id="an_36:2">36:2</span> For he made \[it\] smooth to himself in
his eyes, To find his iniquity to be hated.

<span id="an_36:3">36:3</span> The words of his mouth \[are\] iniquity
and deceit, He ceased to act prudently -- to do good.

<span id="an_36:4">36:4</span> Iniquity he deviseth on his bed, He
stationeth himself on a way not good, Evil he doth not refuse.'

<span id="an_36:5">36:5</span> O Jehovah, in the heavens \[is\] Thy
kindness, Thy faithfulness \[is\] unto the clouds.

<span id="an_36:6">36:6</span> Thy righteousness \[is\] as mountains of
God, Thy judgments \[are\] a great deep. Man and beast Thou savest, O
Jehovah.

<span id="an_36:7">36:7</span> How precious \[is\] Thy kindness, O God,
And the sons of men In the shadow of Thy wings do trust.

<span id="an_36:8">36:8</span> They are filled from the fatness of Thy
house, And the stream of Thy delights Thou dost cause them to drink.

<span id="an_36:9">36:9</span> For with Thee \[is\] a fountain of life,
In Thy light we see light.

<span id="an_36:10">36:10</span> Draw out Thy kindness to those knowing
Thee, And Thy righteousness to the upright of heart.

<span id="an_36:11">36:11</span> Let not a foot of pride meet me, And a
hand of the wicked let not move me.

<span id="an_36:12">36:12</span> There have workers of iniquity fallen,
They have been overthrown, And have not been able to arise!

<span id="an_37:1">37:1</span> By David. Do not fret because of evil
doers, Be not envious against doers of iniquity,

<span id="an_37:2">37:2</span> For as grass speedily they are cut off,
And as the greenness of the tender grass do fade.

<span id="an_37:3">37:3</span> Trust in Jehovah, and do good, Dwell
\[in\] the land, and enjoy faithfulness,

<span id="an_37:4">37:4</span> And delight thyself on Jehovah, And He
giveth to thee the petitions of thy heart.

<span id="an_37:5">37:5</span> Roll on Jehovah thy way, And trust upon
Him, and He worketh,

<span id="an_37:6">37:6</span> And hath brought out as light thy
righteousness, And thy judgment as noon-day.

<span id="an_37:7">37:7</span> Be silent for Jehovah, and stay thyself
for Him, Do not fret because of him Who is making prosperous his way,
Because of a man doing wicked devices.

<span id="an_37:8">37:8</span> Desist from anger, and forsake fury, Fret
not thyself only to do evil.

<span id="an_37:9">37:9</span> For evil doers are cut off, As to those
waiting on Jehovah, they possess the land.

<span id="an_37:10">37:10</span> And yet a little, and the wicked is
not, And thou hast considered his place, and it is not.

<span id="an_37:11">37:11</span> And the humble do possess the land, And
they have delighted themselves In the abundance of peace.

<span id="an_37:12">37:12</span> The wicked is devising against the
righteous, And gnashing against him his teeth.

<span id="an_37:13">37:13</span> The Lord doth laugh at him, For He hath
seen that his day cometh.

<span id="an_37:14">37:14</span> A sword have the wicked opened, And
they have trodden their bow, To cause to fall the poor and needy, To
slaughter the upright of the way.

<span id="an_37:15">37:15</span> Their sword doth enter into their own
heart, And their bows are shivered.

<span id="an_37:16">37:16</span> Better \[is\] the little of the
righteous, Than the store of many wicked.

<span id="an_37:17">37:17</span> For the arms of the wicked are
shivered, And Jehovah is sustaining the righteous.

<span id="an_37:18">37:18</span> Jehovah knoweth the days of the
perfect, And their inheritance is -- to the age.

<span id="an_37:19">37:19</span> They are not ashamed in a time of evil,
And in days of famine they are satisfied.

<span id="an_37:20">37:20</span> But the wicked perish, and the enemies
of Jehovah, As the preciousness of lambs, Have been consumed, In smoke
they have been consumed.

<span id="an_37:21">37:21</span> The wicked is borrowing and repayeth
not, And the righteous is gracious and giving.

<span id="an_37:22">37:22</span> For His blessed ones do possess the
land, And His reviled ones are cut off.

<span id="an_37:23">37:23</span> From Jehovah \[are\] the steps of a
man, They have been prepared, And his way he desireth.

<span id="an_37:24">37:24</span> When he falleth, he is not cast down,
For Jehovah is sustaining his hand.

<span id="an_37:25">37:25</span> Young I have been, I have also become
old, And I have not seen the righteous forsaken, And his seed seeking
bread.

<span id="an_37:26">37:26</span> All the day he is gracious and lending,
And his seed \[is\] for a blessing.

<span id="an_37:27">37:27</span> Turn aside from evil, and do good, and
dwell to the age.

<span id="an_37:28">37:28</span> For Jehovah is loving judgment, And He
doth not forsake His saintly ones, To the age they have been kept, And
the seed of the wicked is cut off.

<span id="an_37:29">37:29</span> The righteous possess the land, And
they dwell for ever on it.

<span id="an_37:30">37:30</span> The mouth of the righteous uttereth
wisdom, And his tongue speaketh judgment.

<span id="an_37:31">37:31</span> The law of his God \[is\] his heart,
His steps do not slide.

<span id="an_37:32">37:32</span> The wicked is watching for the
righteous, And is seeking to put him to death.

<span id="an_37:33">37:33</span> Jehovah doth not leave him in his hand,
Nor condemn him in his being judged.

<span id="an_37:34">37:34</span> Look unto Jehovah, and keep His way,
And He doth exalt thee to possess the land, In the wicked being cut off
-- thou seest!

<span id="an_37:35">37:35</span> I have seen the wicked terrible, And
spreading as a green native plant,

<span id="an_37:36">37:36</span> And he passeth away, and lo, he is not,
And I seek him, and he is not found!

<span id="an_37:37">37:37</span> Observe the perfect, and see the
upright, For the latter end of each \[is\] peace.

<span id="an_37:38">37:38</span> And transgressors were destroyed
together, The latter end of the wicked was cut off.

<span id="an_37:39">37:39</span> And the salvation of the righteous
\[is\] from Jehovah, Their strong place in a time of adversity.

<span id="an_37:40">37:40</span> And Jehovah doth help them and deliver
them, He delivereth them from the wicked, And saveth them, Because they
trusted in Him!

<span id="an_38:1">38:1</span> A Psalm of David, \`To cause to
remember.' Jehovah, in Thy wrath reprove me not, Nor in Thy fury
chastise me.

<span id="an_38:2">38:2</span> For Thine arrows have come down on me,
And Thou lettest down upon me Thy hand.

<span id="an_38:3">38:3</span> Soundness is not in my flesh, Because of
Thine indignation, Peace is not in my bones because of my sin.

<span id="an_38:4">38:4</span> For mine iniquities have passed over my
head, As a heavy burden -- too heavy for me.

<span id="an_38:5">38:5</span> Stunk -- become corrupt have my wounds,
Because of my folly.

<span id="an_38:6">38:6</span> I have been bent down, I have been bowed
down -- unto excess, All the day I have gone mourning.

<span id="an_38:7">38:7</span> For my flanks have been full of drought,
And soundness is not in my flesh.

<span id="an_38:8">38:8</span> I have been feeble and smitten -- unto
excess, I have roared from disquietude of heart.

<span id="an_38:9">38:9</span> Lord, before Thee \[is\] all my desire,
And my sighing from Thee hath not been hid.

<span id="an_38:10">38:10</span> My heart \[is\] panting, my power hath
forsaken me, And the light of mine eyes, Even they are not with me.

<span id="an_38:11">38:11</span> My lovers and my friends over-against
my plague stand. And my neighbours afar off have stood.

<span id="an_38:12">38:12</span> And those seeking my soul lay a snare,
And those seeking my evil Have spoken mischievous things, And they do
deceits meditate all the day.

<span id="an_38:13">38:13</span> And I, as deaf, hear not. And as a dumb
one who openeth not his mouth.

<span id="an_38:14">38:14</span> Yea, I am as a man who heareth not, And
in his mouth are no reproofs.

<span id="an_38:15">38:15</span> Because for Thee, O Jehovah, I have
waited, Thou dost answer, O Lord my God.

<span id="an_38:16">38:16</span> When I said, \`Lest they rejoice over
me, In the slipping of my foot against me they magnified themselves.

<span id="an_38:17">38:17</span> For I am ready to halt, And my pain
\[is\] before me continually.

<span id="an_38:18">38:18</span> For mine iniquity I declare, I am sorry
for my sin.

<span id="an_38:19">38:19</span> And mine enemies \[are\] lively, They
have been strong, and those hating me without cause, Have been
multiplied.

<span id="an_38:20">38:20</span> And those paying evil for good accuse
me, Because of my pursuing good.

<span id="an_38:21">38:21</span> Do not forsake me, O Jehovah, My God,
be not far from me,

<span id="an_38:22">38:22</span> Haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation!

<span id="an_39:1">39:1</span> To the Overseer, to Jeduthun. -- A Psalm
of David. I have said, \`I observe my ways, Against sinning with my
tongue, I keep for my mouth a curb, while the wicked \[is\] before me.'

<span id="an_39:2">39:2</span> I was dumb \[with\] silence, I kept
silent from good, and my pain is excited.

<span id="an_39:3">39:3</span> Hot \[is\] my heart within me, In my
meditating doth the fire burn, I have spoken with my tongue.

<span id="an_39:4">39:4</span> \`Cause me to know, O Jehovah, mine end,
And the measure of my days -- what it \[is\],' I know how frail I
\[am\].

<span id="an_39:5">39:5</span> Lo, handbreadths Thou hast made my days,
And mine age \[is\] as nothing before Thee, Only, all vanity \[is\]
every man set up. Selah.

<span id="an_39:6">39:6</span> Only, in an image doth each walk
habitually, Only, \[in\] vain, they are disquieted, He heapeth up and
knoweth not who gathereth them.

<span id="an_39:7">39:7</span> And, now, what have I expected? O Lord,
my hope -- it \[is\] of Thee.

<span id="an_39:8">39:8</span> From all my transgressions deliver me, A
reproach of the fool make me not.

<span id="an_39:9">39:9</span> I have been dumb, I open not my mouth,
Because Thou -- Thou hast done \[it\].

<span id="an_39:10">39:10</span> Turn aside from off me Thy stroke, From
the striving of Thy hand I have been consumed.

<span id="an_39:11">39:11</span> With reproofs against iniquity, Thou
hast corrected man, And dost waste as a moth his desirableness, Only,
vanity \[is\] every man. Selah.

<span id="an_39:12">39:12</span> Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, And \[to\]
my cry give ear, Unto my tear be not silent, For a sojourner I \[am\]
with Thee, A settler like all my fathers.

<span id="an_39:13">39:13</span> Look from me, and I brighten up before
I go and am not!

<span id="an_40:1">40:1</span> To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. I
have diligently expected Jehovah, And He inclineth to me, and heareth my
cry,

<span id="an_40:2">40:2</span> And He doth cause me to come up From a
pit of desolation -- from mire of mud, And He raiseth up on a rock my
feet, He is establishing my steps.

<span id="an_40:3">40:3</span> And He putteth in my mouth a new song,
\`Praise to our God.' Many do see and fear, and trust in Jehovah.

<span id="an_40:4">40:4</span> O the happiness of the man Who hath made
Jehovah his trust, And hath not turned unto the proud, And those turning
aside to lies.

<span id="an_40:5">40:5</span> Much hast Thou done, Jehovah my God; Thy
wonders and Thy thoughts toward us, There is none to arrange unto Thee,
I declare and speak: They have been more than to be numbered.

<span id="an_40:6">40:6</span> Sacrifice and present Thou hast not
desired, Ears Thou hast prepared for me, Burnt and sin-offering Thou
hast not asked.

<span id="an_40:7">40:7</span> Then said I, \`Lo, I have come,' In the
roll of the book it is written of me,

<span id="an_40:8">40:8</span> To do Thy pleasure, my God, I have
delighted, And Thy law \[is\] within my heart.

<span id="an_40:9">40:9</span> I have proclaimed tidings of
righteousness In the great assembly, lo, my lips I restrain not, O
Jehovah, Thou hast known.

<span id="an_40:10">40:10</span> Thy righteousness I have not concealed
In the midst of my heart, Thy faithfulness and Thy salvation I have
told, I have not hidden Thy kindness and Thy truth, To the great
assembly.

<span id="an_40:11">40:11</span> Thou, O Jehovah, restrainest not Thy
mercies from me, Thy kindness and Thy truth do continually keep me.

<span id="an_40:12">40:12</span> For compassed me have evils
innumerable, Overtaken me have mine iniquities, And I have not been able
to see; They have been more than the hairs of my head, And my heart hath
forsaken me.

<span id="an_40:13">40:13</span> Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me, O
Jehovah, for my help make haste.

<span id="an_40:14">40:14</span> They are ashamed and confounded
together, Who are seeking my soul to destroy it, They are turned
backward, And are ashamed, who are desiring my evil.

<span id="an_40:15">40:15</span> They are desolate because of their
shame, Who are saying to me, \`Aha, aha.'

<span id="an_40:16">40:16</span> All seeking Thee rejoice and are glad
in Thee, Those loving Thy salvation say continually, \`Jehovah is
magnified.'

<span id="an_40:17">40:17</span> And I \[am\] poor and needy, The Lord
doth devise for me. My help and my deliverer \[art\] Thou, O my God,
tarry Thou not.

<span id="an_41:1">41:1</span> To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. O
the happiness of him Who is acting wisely unto the poor, In a day of
evil doth Jehovah deliver him.

<span id="an_41:2">41:2</span> Jehovah doth preserve him and revive him,
He is happy in the land, And Thou givest him not into the will of his
enemies.

<span id="an_41:3">41:3</span> Jehovah supporteth on a couch of
sickness, All his bed Thou hast turned in his weakness.

<span id="an_41:4">41:4</span> I -- I said, \`O Jehovah, favour me, Heal
my soul, for I did sin against Thee,'

<span id="an_41:5">41:5</span> Mine enemies say evil of me: When he
dieth -- his name hath perished!

<span id="an_41:6">41:6</span> And if he came to see -- vanity he
speaketh, His heart gathereth iniquity to itself, He goeth out -- at the
street he speaketh.

<span id="an_41:7">41:7</span> All hating me whisper together against
me, Against me they devise evil to me:

<span id="an_41:8">41:8</span> A thing of Belial is poured out on him,
And because he lay down he riseth not again.

<span id="an_41:9">41:9</span> Even mine ally, in whom I trusted, One
eating my bread, made great the heel against me,

<span id="an_41:10">41:10</span> And Thou, Jehovah, favour me, And cause
me to rise, And I give recompence to them.

<span id="an_41:11">41:11</span> By this I have known, That Thou hast
delighted in me, Because my enemy shouteth not over me.

<span id="an_41:12">41:12</span> As to me, in mine integrity, Thou hast
taken hold upon me, And causest me to stand before Thee to the age.

<span id="an_41:13">41:13</span> Blessed \[is\] Jehovah, God of Israel,
From the age -- and unto the age. Amen and Amen.

<span id="an_42:1">42:1</span> To the Overseer. -- An Instruction. By
sons of Korah. As a hart doth pant for streams of water, So my soul
panteth toward Thee, O God.

<span id="an_42:2">42:2</span> My soul thirsted for God, for the living
God, When do I enter and see the face of God?

<span id="an_42:3">42:3</span> My tear hath been to me bread day and
night, In their saying unto me all the day, \`Where \[is\] thy God?'

<span id="an_42:4">42:4</span> These I remember, and pour out my soul in
me, For I pass over into the booth, I go softly with them unto the house
of God, With the voice of singing and confession, The multitude keeping
feast!

<span id="an_42:5">42:5</span> What! bowest thou thyself, O my soul?
Yea, art thou troubled within me? Wait for God, for still I confess Him:
The salvation of my countenance -- My God!

<span id="an_42:6">42:6</span> In me doth my soul bow itself, Therefore
I remember Thee from the land of Jordan, And of the Hermons, from the
hill Mizar.

<span id="an_42:7">42:7</span> Deep unto deep is calling At the noise of
Thy water-spouts, All Thy breakers and Thy billows passed over me.

<span id="an_42:8">42:8</span> By day Jehovah commandeth His kindness,
And by night a song \[is\] with me, A prayer to the God of my life.

<span id="an_42:9">42:9</span> I say to God my rock, \`Why hast Thou
forgotten me? Why go I mourning in the oppression of an enemy?

<span id="an_42:10">42:10</span> With a sword in my bones Have mine
adversaries reproached me, In their saying unto me all the day, \`Where
\[is\] thy God?'

<span id="an_42:11">42:11</span> What! bowest thou thyself, O my soul?
And what! art thou troubled within me? Wait for God, for still I confess
Him, The salvation of my countenance, and my God!

<span id="an_43:1">43:1</span> Judge me, O God, And plead my cause
against a nation not pious, From a man of deceit and perverseness Thou
dost deliver me,

<span id="an_43:2">43:2</span> For thou \[art\] the God of my strength.
Why hast Thou cast me off? Why mourning do I go up and down, In the
oppression of an enemy?

<span id="an_43:3">43:3</span> Send forth Thy light and Thy truth, They
-- they lead me, they bring me in, Unto Thy holy hill, and unto Thy
tabernacles.

<span id="an_43:4">43:4</span> And I go in unto the altar of God, Unto
God, the joy of my rejoicing. And I thank Thee with a harp, O God, my
God.

<span id="an_43:5">43:5</span> What! bowest thou thyself, O my soul? And
what! art thou troubled within me? Wait for God, for still I confess
Him, The salvation of my countenance, and my God!

<span id="an_44:1">44:1</span> To the Overseer. -- By sons of Korah. An
Instruction. O God, with our ears we have heard, Our fathers have
recounted to us, The work Thou didst work in their days, In the days of
old.

<span id="an_44:2">44:2</span> Thou, \[with\] Thy hand, nations hast
dispossessed. And Thou dost plant them. Thou afflictest peoples, and
sendest them away.

<span id="an_44:3">44:3</span> For, not by their sword Possessed they
the land, And their arm gave not salvation to them, But Thy right hand,
and Thine arm, And the light of Thy countenance, Because Thou hadst
accepted them.

<span id="an_44:4">44:4</span> Thou \[art\] He, my king, O God, Command
the deliverances of Jacob.

<span id="an_44:5">44:5</span> By Thee our adversaries we do push, By
Thy name tread down our withstanders,

<span id="an_44:6">44:6</span> For, not in my bow do I trust, And my
sword doth not save me.

<span id="an_44:7">44:7</span> For Thou hast saved us from our
adversaries, And those hating us Thou hast put to shame.

<span id="an_44:8">44:8</span> In God we have boasted all the day, And
Thy name to the age we thank. Selah.

<span id="an_44:9">44:9</span> In anger Thou hast cast off and causest
us to blush, And goest not forth with our hosts.

<span id="an_44:10">44:10</span> Thou causest us to turn backward from
an adversary, And those hating us, Have spoiled for themselves.

<span id="an_44:11">44:11</span> Thou makest us food like sheep, And
among nations Thou hast scattered us.

<span id="an_44:12">44:12</span> Thou sellest Thy people -- without
wealth, And hast not become great by their price.

<span id="an_44:13">44:13</span> Thou makest us a reproach to our
neighbours, A scorn and a reproach to our surrounders.

<span id="an_44:14">44:14</span> Thou makest us a simile among nations,
A shaking of the head among peoples.

<span id="an_44:15">44:15</span> All the day my confusion \[is\] before
me, And the shame of my face hath covered me.

<span id="an_44:16">44:16</span> Because of the voice of a reproacher
and reviler, Because of an enemy and a self-avenger.

<span id="an_44:17">44:17</span> All this met us, and we did not forget
Thee, Nor have we dealt falsely in Thy covenant.

<span id="an_44:18">44:18</span> We turn not backward our heart, Nor
turn aside doth our step from Thy path.

<span id="an_44:19">44:19</span> But Thou hast smitten us in a place of
dragons, And dost cover us over with death-shade.

<span id="an_44:20">44:20</span> If we have forgotten the name of our
God, And spread our hands to a strange God,

<span id="an_44:21">44:21</span> Doth not God search out this? For He
knoweth the secrets of the heart.

<span id="an_44:22">44:22</span> Surely, for Thy sake we have been slain
all the day, Reckoned as sheep of the slaughter.

<span id="an_44:23">44:23</span> Stir up -- why dost Thou sleep, O Lord?
Awake, cast us not off for ever.

<span id="an_44:24">44:24</span> Why Thy face hidest Thou? Thou
forgettest our afflictions and our oppression,

<span id="an_44:25">44:25</span> For bowed to the dust hath our soul,
Cleaved to the earth hath our belly.

<span id="an_44:26">44:26</span> Arise, a help to us, And ransom us for
thy kindness' sake.

<span id="an_45:1">45:1</span> To the Overseer. -- \`On the Lilies.' --
By sons of Korah. -- An Instruction. -- A song of loves. My heart hath
indited a good thing, I am telling my works to a king, My tongue \[is\]
the pen of a speedy writer.

<span id="an_45:2">45:2</span> Thou hast been beautified above the sons
of men, Grace hath been poured into thy lips, Therefore hath God blessed
thee to the age.

<span id="an_45:3">45:3</span> Gird Thy sword upon the thigh, O mighty,
Thy glory and Thy majesty!

<span id="an_45:4">45:4</span> As to Thy majesty -- prosper! -- ride!

showeth Thee fearful things.

<span id="an_45:6">45:6</span> Thy throne, O God, \[is\] age-during, and
for ever, A sceptre of uprightness \[Is\] the sceptre of Thy kingdom.

<span id="an_45:7">45:7</span> Thou hast loved righteousness and hatest
wickedness, Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee, Oil of joy above
thy companions.

<span id="an_45:8">45:8</span> Myrrh and aloes, cassia! all thy
garments, Out of palaces of ivory Stringed instruments have made thee
glad.

<span id="an_45:9">45:9</span> Daughters of kings \[are\] among thy
precious ones, A queen hath stood at thy right hand, In pure gold of
Ophir.

<span id="an_45:10">45:10</span> Hearken, O daughter, and see, incline
thine ear, And forget thy people, and thy father's house,

<span id="an_45:11">45:11</span> And the king doth desire thy beauty,
Because he \[is\] thy lord -- bow thyself to him,

<span id="an_45:12">45:12</span> And the daughter of Tyre with a
present, The rich of the people do appease thy face.

<span id="an_45:15">45:15</span> They are brought with joy and gladness,
They come into the palace of the king.

<span id="an_45:16">45:16</span> Instead of thy fathers are thy sons,
Thou dost appoint them for princes in all the earth.

Mountains they shake in its pride. Selah.

<span id="an_46:9">46:9</span> Causing wars to cease, Unto the end of
the earth, the bow he shivereth, And the spear He hath cut asunder,
Chariots he doth burn with fire.

<span id="an_46:10">46:10</span> Desist, and know that I \[am\] God, I
am exalted among nations, I am exalted in the earth.

<span id="an_46:11">46:11</span> Jehovah of hosts \[is\] with us, A
tower for us \[is\] the God of Jacob! Selah.

<span id="an_47:1">47:1</span> To the Overseer. -- By sons of Korah. A
Psalm. All ye peoples, clap the hand, Shout to God with a voice of
singing,

<span id="an_47:2">47:2</span> For Jehovah Most High \[is\] fearful, A
great king over all the earth.

<span id="an_47:3">47:3</span> He leadeth peoples under us, and nations
under our feet.

<span id="an_47:4">47:4</span> He doth choose for us our inheritance,
The excellency of Jacob that He loves. Selah.

<span id="an_47:5">47:5</span> God hath gone up with a shout, Jehovah
with the sound of a trumpet.

<span id="an_47:6">47:6</span> Praise God -- praise -- give praise to
our king, praise.

<span id="an_47:7">47:7</span> For king of all the earth \[is\] God,
Give praise, O understanding one.

<span id="an_47:8">47:8</span> God hath reigned over nations, God hath
sat on His holy throne,

<span id="an_47:9">47:9</span> Nobles of peoples have been gathered,
\[With\] the people of the God of Abraham, For to God \[are\] the
shields of earth, Greatly hath He been exalted!

<span id="an_48:1">48:1</span> A Song, a Psalm, by sons of Korah. Great
\[is\] Jehovah, and praised greatly, In the city of our God -- His holy
hill.

<span id="an_48:2">48:2</span> Beautiful \[for\] elevation, A joy of all
the land, \[is\] Mount Zion, The sides of the north, the city of a great
king.

<span id="an_48:3">48:3</span> God in her high places is known for a
tower.

<span id="an_48:4">48:4</span> For, lo, the kings met, they passed by
together,

<span id="an_48:5">48:5</span> They have seen -- so they have marvelled,
They have been troubled, they were hastened away.

<span id="an_48:6">48:6</span> Trembling hath seized them there, Pain,
as of a travailing woman.

<span id="an_48:7">48:7</span> By an east wind Thou shiverest ships of
Tarshish.

<span id="an_48:8">48:8</span> As we have heard, so we have seen, In the
city of Jehovah of hosts, In the city of our God, God doth establish her
-- to the age. Selah.

<span id="an_48:9">48:9</span> We have thought, O God, of Thy kindness,
In the midst of Thy temple,

<span id="an_48:10">48:10</span> As \[is\] Thy name, O God, so \[is\]
Thy praise, Over the ends of the earth, Righteousness hath filled Thy
right hand.

<span id="an_48:11">48:11</span> Rejoice doth Mount Zion, The daughters
of Judah are joyful, For the sake of Thy judgments.

<span id="an_48:12">48:12</span> Compass Zion, and go round her, count
her towers,

<span id="an_48:13">48:13</span> Set your heart to her bulwark, Consider
her high places, So that ye recount to a later generation,

<span id="an_48:14">48:14</span> That this God \[is\] our God -- To the
age and for ever, He -- he doth lead us over death!

<span id="an_49:1">49:1</span> To the Overseer. -- By sons of Korah. A
Psalm. Hear this, all ye peoples, Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the
world.

<span id="an_49:2">49:2</span> Both low and high, together rich and
needy.

<span id="an_49:3">49:3</span> My mouth speaketh wise things, And the
meditations of my heart \[are\] things of understanding.

<span id="an_49:4">49:4</span> I incline to a simile mine ear, I open
with a harp my riddle:

<span id="an_49:5">49:5</span> Why do I fear in days of evil? The
iniquity of my supplanters doth compass me.

<span id="an_49:6">49:6</span> Those trusting on their wealth, And in
the multitude of their riches, Do shew themselves foolish.

<span id="an_49:7">49:7</span> A brother doth no one at all ransom, He
doth not give to God his atonement.

<span id="an_49:8">49:8</span> And precious \[is\] the redemption of
their soul, And it hath ceased -- to the age.

<span id="an_49:9">49:9</span> And still he liveth for ever, He seeth
not the pit.

<span id="an_49:10">49:10</span> For he seeth wise men die, Together the
foolish and brutish perish, And have left to others their wealth.

<span id="an_49:11">49:11</span> Their heart \[is\]: Their houses
\[are\] to the age, Their tabernacles to all generations. They
proclaimed their names over the lands.

<span id="an_49:12">49:12</span> And man in honour doth not remain, He
hath been like the beasts, they have been cut off.

<span id="an_49:13">49:13</span> This their way \[is\] folly for them,
And their posterity with their sayings are pleased. Selah.

<span id="an_49:14">49:14</span> As sheep for Sheol they have set
themselves, Death doth afflict them, And the upright rule over them in
the morning, And their form \[is\] for consumption. Sheol \[is\] a
dwelling for him.

<span id="an_49:15">49:15</span> Only, God doth ransom my soul from the
hand of Sheol, For He doth receive me. Selah.

<span id="an_49:16">49:16</span> Fear not, when one maketh wealth, When
the honour of his house is abundant,

<span id="an_49:17">49:17</span> For at his death he receiveth nothing,
His honour goeth not down after him.

<span id="an_49:18">49:18</span> For his soul in his life he blesseth,
(And they praise thee when thou dost well for thyself.)

<span id="an_49:19">49:19</span> It cometh to the generation of his
fathers, For ever they see not the light.

<span id="an_49:20">49:20</span> Man in honour, who understandest not,
Hath been like the beasts, they have been cut off!

<span id="an_50:1">50:1</span> A Psalm of Asaph. The God of gods --
Jehovah -- hath spoken, And He calleth to the earth From the rising of
the sun unto its going in.

<span id="an_50:2">50:2</span> From Zion, the perfection of beauty, God
shone.

<span id="an_50:3">50:3</span> Our God cometh, and is not silent, Fire
before Him doth devour, And round about him it hath been very
tempestuous.

<span id="an_50:4">50:4</span> He doth call unto the heavens from above,
And unto the earth, to judge His people.

<span id="an_50:5">50:5</span> Gather ye to Me My saints, Making
covenant with Me over a sacrifice.

<span id="an_50:6">50:6</span> And the heavens declare His
righteousness, For God Himself \[is\] judge. Selah.

<span id="an_50:7">50:7</span> Hear, O My people, and I speak, O Israel,
and I testify against thee, God, thy God \[am\] I.

<span id="an_50:8">50:8</span> Not for thy sacrifices do I reprove thee,
Yea, thy burnt-offerings \[Are\] before Me continually.

<span id="an_50:9">50:9</span> I take not from thy house a bullock, From
thy folds he goats.

<span id="an_50:10">50:10</span> For Mine \[is\] every beast of the
forest, The cattle on the hills of oxen.

<span id="an_50:11">50:11</span> I have known every fowl of the
mountains, And the wild beast of the field \[is\] with Me.

<span id="an_50:12">50:12</span> If I am hungry I tell not to thee, For
Mine \[is\] the world and its fulness.

<span id="an_50:13">50:13</span> Do I eat the flesh of bulls, And drink
the blood of he-goats?

<span id="an_50:14">50:14</span> Sacrifice to God confession, And
complete to the Most High thy vows.

<span id="an_50:15">50:15</span> And call Me in a day of adversity, I
deliver thee, and thou honourest Me.

<span id="an_50:16">50:16</span> And to the wicked hath God said: What
to thee -- to recount My statutes? That thou liftest up My covenant on
thy mouth?

<span id="an_50:17">50:17</span> Yea, thou hast hated instruction, And
dost cast My words behind thee.

<span id="an_50:18">50:18</span> If thou hast seen a thief, Then thou
art pleased with him, And with adulterers \[is\] thy portion.

<span id="an_50:19">50:19</span> Thy mouth thou hast sent forth with
evil, And thy tongue joineth deceit together,

<span id="an_50:20">50:20</span> Thou sittest, against thy brother thou
speakest, Against a son of thy mother givest slander.

<span id="an_50:21">50:21</span> These thou didst, and I kept silent,
Thou hast thought that I am like thee, I reprove thee, and set in array
before thine eyes.

<span id="an_50:22">50:22</span> Understand this, I pray you, Ye who are
forgetting God, Lest I tear, and there is no deliverer.

<span id="an_50:23">50:23</span> He who is sacrificing praise honoureth
Me, As to him who maketh a way, I cause him to look on the salvation of
God!

<span id="an_51:1">51:1</span> To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David, in
the coming inn unto him of Nathan the prophet, when he hath gone in unto
Bath-Sheba. Favour me, O God, according to Thy kindness, According to
the abundance of Thy mercies, Blot out my transgressions.

<span id="an_51:2">51:2</span> Thoroughly wash me from mine iniquity,
And from my sin cleanse me,

<span id="an_51:3">51:3</span> For my transgressions I do know, And my
sin \[is\] before me continually.

<span id="an_51:4">51:4</span> Against Thee, Thee only, I have sinned,
And done the evil thing in Thine eyes, So that Thou art righteous in Thy
words, Thou art pure in Thy judging.

<span id="an_51:5">51:5</span> Lo, in iniquity I have been brought
forth, And in sin doth my mother conceive me.

<span id="an_51:6">51:6</span> Lo, truth Thou hast desired in the inward
parts, And in the hidden part Wisdom Thou causest me to know.

<span id="an_51:7">51:7</span> Thou cleansest me with hyssop and I am
clean, Washest me, and than snow I am whiter.

<span id="an_51:8">51:8</span> Thou causest me to hear joy and gladness,
Thou makest joyful bones Thou hast bruised.

<span id="an_51:9">51:9</span> Hide Thy face from my sin. And all mine
iniquities blot out.

<span id="an_51:10">51:10</span> A clean heart prepare for me, O God,
And a right spirit renew within me.

<span id="an_51:11">51:11</span> Cast me not forth from Thy presence,
And Thy Holy Spirit take not from me.

<span id="an_51:12">51:12</span> Restore to me the joy of Thy salvation,
And a willing spirit doth sustain me.

<span id="an_51:13">51:13</span> I teach transgressors Thy ways, And
sinners unto Thee do return.

<span id="an_51:14">51:14</span> Deliver me from blood, O God, God of my
salvation, My tongue singeth of Thy righteousness.

<span id="an_51:15">51:15</span> O Lord, my lips thou dost open, And my
mouth declareth Thy praise.

<span id="an_51:16">51:16</span> For Thou desirest not sacrifice, or I
give \[it\], Burnt-offering Thou acceptest not.

<span id="an_51:17">51:17</span> The sacrifices of God \[are\] a broken
spirit, A heart broken and bruised, O God, Thou dost not despise.

<span id="an_51:18">51:18</span> Do good in Thy good pleasure with Zion,
Thou dost build the walls of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_51:19">51:19</span> Then Thou desirest sacrifices of
righteousness, Burnt-offering, and whole burnt-offering, Then they offer
bullocks on thine altar!

<span id="an_52:1">52:1</span> To the Overseer. -- An instruction, by
David, in the coming in of Doeg the Edomite, and he declareth to Saul,
and saith to him, \`David came in unto the house of Ahimelech.' What,
boasteth thou in evil, O mighty one? The kindness of God \[is\] all the
day.

<span id="an_52:2">52:2</span> Mischiefs doth thy tongue devise, Like a
sharp razor, working deceit.

<span id="an_52:3">52:3</span> Thou hast loved evil rather than good,
Lying, than speaking righteousness. Selah.

<span id="an_52:4">52:4</span> Thou hast loved all devouring words, O
thou deceitful tongue.

<span id="an_52:5">52:5</span> Also -- God doth break thee down for
ever, Taketh thee, and pulleth thee out of the tent, And He hath
uprooted thee Out of the land of the living. Selah.

<span id="an_52:6">52:6</span> And the righteous see, And fear, and
laugh at him.

<span id="an_52:7">52:7</span> \`Lo, the man who maketh not God his
strong place, And trusteth in the abundance of his riches, He is strong
in his mischiefs.'

<span id="an_52:8">52:8</span> And I, as a green olive in the house of
God, I have trusted in the kindness of God, To the age and for ever,

<span id="an_52:9">52:9</span> I thank Thee to the age, because Thou
hast done \[it\], And I wait \[on\] Thy name for \[it is\] good before
Thy saints!

<span id="an_53:1">53:1</span> To the Overseer. -- \`On a disease.' --
An instruction, by David. A fool said in his heart, \`There is no God.'
They have done corruptly, Yea, they have done abominable iniquity, There
is none doing good.

<span id="an_53:2">53:2</span> God from the heavens looked on the sons
of men, To see if there be an understanding one, \[One\] seeking God.

<span id="an_53:3">53:3</span> Every one went back, together they became
filthy, There is none doing good -- not even one.

<span id="an_53:4">53:4</span> Have not workers of iniquity known, Those
eating my people have eaten bread, God they have not called.

<span id="an_53:5">53:5</span> There they feared a fear -- there was no
fear, For God hath scattered the bones of him Who is encamping against
thee, Thou hast put to shame, For God hath despised them.

<span id="an_53:6">53:6</span> Who doth give from Zion the salvation of
Israel? When God turneth back \[to\] a captivity of His people, Jacob
doth rejoice -- Israel is glad!

<span id="an_54:1">54:1</span> To the Overseer with stringed
instruments. -- An instruction, by David, in the coming in of the
Ziphim, and they say to Saul, \`Is not David hiding himself with us?' O
God, by Thy name save me, and by Thy might judge me.

<span id="an_54:2">54:2</span> O God, hear my prayer, Give ear to the
sayings of my mouth,

<span id="an_54:3">54:3</span> For strangers have risen up against me
And terrible ones have sought my soul, They have not set God before
them. Selah.

<span id="an_54:4">54:4</span> Lo, God \[is\] a helper to me, The Lord
\[is\] with those supporting my soul,

<span id="an_54:5">54:5</span> Turn back doth the evil thing to mine
enemies, In Thy truth cut them off.

<span id="an_54:6">54:6</span> With a free will-offering I sacrifice to
Thee, I thank Thy name, O Jehovah, for \[it is\] good,

<span id="an_54:7">54:7</span> For, from all adversity He delivered me,
And on mine enemies hath mine eye looked!

<span id="an_55:1">55:1</span> To the Overseer with stringed
instruments. -- An instruction, by David. Give ear, O God, \[to\] my
prayer, And hide not from my supplication.

<span id="an_55:2">55:2</span> Attend to me, and answer me, I mourn in
my meditation, and make a noise,

<span id="an_55:3">55:3</span> Because of the voice of an enemy, Because
of the oppression of the wicked, For they cause sorrow to move against
me, And in anger they hate me.

<span id="an_55:4">55:4</span> My heart is pained within me, And terrors
of death have fallen on me.

<span id="an_55:5">55:5</span> Fear and trembling come in to me, And
horror doth cover me.

<span id="an_55:6">55:6</span> And I say, \`Who doth give to me a pinion
as a dove? I fly away and rest,

<span id="an_55:7">55:7</span> Lo, I move far off, I lodge in a
wilderness. Selah.

<span id="an_55:8">55:8</span> I hasten escape for myself, From a
rushing wind, from a whirlwind.

<span id="an_55:9">55:9</span> Swallow up, O Lord, divide their tongue,
For I saw violence and strife in a city.

<span id="an_55:10">55:10</span> By day and by night they go round it,
on its walls. Both iniquity and perverseness \[are\] in its midst,

<span id="an_55:11">55:11</span> Mischiefs \[are\] in its midst. Fraud
and deceit depart not from its street.

<span id="an_55:12">55:12</span> For an enemy reproacheth me not, or I
bear \[it\], He who is hating me Hath not magnified himself against me,
Or I hide from him.

<span id="an_55:13">55:13</span> But thou, a man -- as mine equal, My
familiar friend, and mine acquaintance.

<span id="an_55:14">55:14</span> When together we sweeten counsel, Into
the house of God we walk in company.

<span id="an_55:15">55:15</span> Desolations \[are\] upon them, They go
down \[to\] Sheol -- alive, For wickedness \[is\] in their dwelling, in
their midst.

<span id="an_55:16">55:16</span> I -- to God I call, and Jehovah saveth
me.

<span id="an_55:17">55:17</span> Evening, and morning, and noon, I
meditate, and make a noise, and He heareth my voice,

<span id="an_55:18">55:18</span> He hath ransomed in peace my soul From
him who is near to me, For with the multitude they were with me.

<span id="an_55:19">55:19</span> God doth hear and afflict them, And He
sitteth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, and fear not God,

<span id="an_55:20">55:20</span> He hath sent forth his hands against
his well-wishers, He hath polluted his covenant.

<span id="an_55:21">55:21</span> Sweeter than honey hath been his mouth,
And his heart \[is\] war! Softer have been his words than oil, And they
\[are\] drawn \[swords\].

<span id="an_55:22">55:22</span> Cast on Jehovah that which He hath
given thee, And He doth sustain thee, He doth not suffer for ever the
moving of the righteous.

<span id="an_55:23">55:23</span> And Thou, O God, dost bring them down
To a pit of destruction, Men of blood and deceit reach not to half their
days, And I -- I do trust in Thee!

<span id="an_56:1">56:1</span> To the Overseer. -- \`On the Dumb Dove
far off.' -- A secret treasure of David, in the Philistines' taking hold
of him in Gath. Favour me, O God, for man swallowed me up, All the day
fighting he oppresseth me,

<span id="an_56:2">56:2</span> Mine enemies have swallowed up all the
day, For many \[are\] fighting against me, O most High,

<span id="an_56:3">56:3</span> The day I am afraid I am confident toward
Thee.

<span id="an_56:4">56:4</span> In God I praise His word, in God I have
trusted, I fear not what flesh doth to me.

<span id="an_56:5">56:5</span> All the day they wrest my words,
Concerning me all their thoughts \[are\] for evil,

<span id="an_56:6">56:6</span> They assemble, they hide, they watch my
heels, When they have expected my soul.

<span id="an_56:7">56:7</span> By iniquity they escape, In anger the
peoples put down, O God.

<span id="an_56:8">56:8</span> My wandering Thou hast counted, Thou --
place Thou my tear in Thy bottle, Are they not in Thy book?

<span id="an_56:9">56:9</span> Then turn back do mine enemies in the day
I call. This I have known, that God \[is\] for me.

<span id="an_56:10">56:10</span> In God I praise the word, In Jehovah I
praise the word.

<span id="an_56:11">56:11</span> In God I trusted, I fear not what man
doth to me,

<span id="an_56:12">56:12</span> On me, O God, \[are\] Thy vows, I repay
thank-offerings to Thee.

<span id="an_56:13">56:13</span> For Thou hast delivered my soul from
death, Dost Thou not my feet from falling? To walk habitually before God
in the light of the living!

<span id="an_57:1">57:1</span> To the Overseer. -- \`Destroy not.' -- A
secret treasure of David, in his fleeing from the face of Saul into a
cave. Favour me, O God, favour me, For in Thee is my soul trusting, And
in the shadow of Thy wings I trust, Until the calamities pass over.

<span id="an_57:2">57:2</span> I call to God Most High, To God \[who\]
is perfecting for me.

<span id="an_57:3">57:3</span> He sendeth from the heaven, and saveth
me, He reproached -- who is panting after me. Selah. God sendeth forth
His kindness and His truth.

<span id="an_57:4">57:4</span> My soul \[is\] in the midst of lions, I
lie down \[among\] flames -- sons of men, Their teeth \[are\] a spear
and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword.

<span id="an_57:5">57:5</span> Be Thou exalted above the heavens, O God,
Above all the earth Thine honour.

<span id="an_57:6">57:6</span> A net they have prepared for my steps,
Bowed down hath my soul, They have digged before me a pit, They have
fallen into its midst. Selah.

<span id="an_57:7">57:7</span> Prepared is my heart, O God, Prepared is
my heart, I sing and praise.

<span id="an_57:8">57:8</span> Awake, mine honour, awake, psaltery and
harp, I awake the morning dawn.

<span id="an_57:9">57:9</span> I thank Thee among the peoples, O Lord, I
praise Thee among the nations.

<span id="an_57:10">57:10</span> For great unto the heavens \[is\] Thy
kindness, And unto the clouds Thy truth.

<span id="an_57:11">57:11</span> Be thou exalted above the heavens, O
God. Above all the earth Thine honour!

<span id="an_58:1">58:1</span> To the Overseer. -- \`Destroy not.' -- A
secret treasure, by David. Is it true, O dumb one, righteously ye speak?
Uprightly ye judge, O sons of men?

<span id="an_58:2">58:2</span> Even in heart ye work iniquities, In the
land the violence of your hands ye ponder.

<span id="an_58:3">58:3</span> The wicked have been estranged from the
womb, They have erred from the belly, speaking lies.

<span id="an_58:4">58:4</span> Their poison \[is\] as poison of a
serpent, As a deaf asp shutting its ear,

<span id="an_58:5">58:5</span> Which hearkeneth not to the voice of
whisperers, A charmer of charms most skilful.

<span id="an_58:6">58:6</span> O God, break their teeth in their mouth,
The jaw-teeth of young lions break down, O Jehovah.

<span id="an_58:7">58:7</span> They are melted as waters, They go up and
down for themselves, His arrow proceedeth as they cut themselves off.

<span id="an_58:8">58:8</span> As a snail that melteth he goeth on,
\[As\] an untimely birth of a woman, They have not seen the sun.

<span id="an_58:9">58:9</span> Before your pots discern the bramble, As
well the raw as the heated He whirleth away.

<span id="an_58:10">58:10</span> The righteous rejoiceth that he hath
seen vengeance, His steps he washeth in the blood of the wicked.

<span id="an_58:11">58:11</span> And man saith: \`Surely fruit \[is\]
for the righteous: Surely there is a God judging in the earth!'

<span id="an_59:1">59:1</span> To the Overseer. -- \`Destroy not,' by
David. -- A secret treasure, in Saul's sending, and they watch the house

withstanders set me on high.

<span id="an_59:2">59:2</span> Deliver me from workers of iniquity, And
from men of blood save me.

<span id="an_59:3">59:3</span> For, lo, they laid wait for my soul,
Assembled against me are strong ones, Not my transgression nor my sin, O
Jehovah.

<span id="an_59:4">59:4</span> Without punishment they run and prepare
themselves, Stir up to meet me, and see.

<span id="an_59:5">59:5</span> And Thou, Jehovah, God of Hosts, God of
Israel, Awake to inspect all the nations. Favour not any treacherous
dealers of iniquity. Selah.

<span id="an_59:6">59:6</span> They turn back at evening, They make a
noise like a dog, And go round about the city.

<span id="an_59:7">59:7</span> Lo, they belch out with their mouths,
Swords \[are\] in their lips, for \`Who heareth?'

<span id="an_59:8">59:8</span> And Thou, O Jehovah dost laugh at them,
Thou dost mock at all the nations.

<span id="an_59:9">59:9</span> O my Strength, unto Thee I take heed, For
God \[is\] my tower -- the God of my kindness.

<span id="an_59:10">59:10</span> God doth go before me, He causeth me to
look on mine enemies.

<span id="an_59:11">59:11</span> Slay them not, lest my people forget,
Shake them by Thy strength, And bring them down, O Lord our shield.

<span id="an_59:12">59:12</span> The sin of their mouth \[is\] a word of
their lips, And they are captured in their pride, And from the curse and
lying they recount.

<span id="an_59:13">59:13</span> Consume in fury, consume and they are
not, And they know that God is ruling in Jacob, To the ends of the
earth. Selah.

<span id="an_59:14">59:14</span> And they turn back at evening, They
make a noise like a dog, And they go round about the city.

<span id="an_59:15">59:15</span> They -- they wander for food, If they
are not satisfied -- then they murmur.

<span id="an_59:16">59:16</span> And I -- I sing \[of\] Thy strength,
And I sing at morn \[of\] Thy kindness, For thou hast been a tower to
me, And a refuge for me in a day of adversity.

<span id="an_59:17">59:17</span> O my Strength, unto Thee I sing praise,
For God \[is\] my tower, the God of my kindness!

<span id="an_60:1">60:1</span> To the Overseer. -- \`Concerning the Lily
of Testimony,' a secret treasure of David, to teach, in his striving

smiteth Edom in the valley of Salt -- twelve thousand. O God, Thou hadst
cast us off, Thou hadst broken us -- hadst been angry! -- Thou dost turn
back to us.

<span id="an_60:2">60:2</span> Thou hast caused the land to tremble,
Thou hast broken it, Heal its breaches, for it hath moved.

<span id="an_60:3">60:3</span> Thou hast shewn Thy people a hard thing,
Thou hast caused us to drink wine of trembling.

<span id="an_60:4">60:4</span> Thou hast given to those fearing thee an
ensign. To be lifted up as an ensign Because of truth. Selah.

<span id="an_60:5">60:5</span> That Thy beloved ones may be drawn out,
Save \[with\] Thy right hand, and answer us.

<span id="an_60:6">60:6</span> God hath spoken in His holiness: I exult
-- I apportion Shechem, And the valley of Succoth I measure,

Manasseh, And Ephraim \[is\] the strength of my head, Judah \[is\] my

bulwarks? Who hath led me unto Edom?

<span id="an_60:10">60:10</span> Is it not Thou, O God? hast Thou cast
us off? And dost Thou not go forth, O God, with our hosts!

<span id="an_60:11">60:11</span> Give to us help from adversity, And
vain \[is\] the deliverance of man.

<span id="an_60:12">60:12</span> In God we do mightily, And He treadeth
down our adversaries!

<span id="an_61:1">61:1</span> To the Overseer, on stringed instruments.
-- By David. Hear, O God, my loud cry, attend to my prayer.

<span id="an_61:2">61:2</span> From the end of the land unto Thee I
call, In the feebleness of my heart, Into a rock higher than I Thou dost
lead me.

<span id="an_61:3">61:3</span> For Thou hast been a refuge for me, A
tower of strength because of the enemy.

<span id="an_61:4">61:4</span> I sojourn in Thy tent to the ages, I
trust in the secret place of Thy wings. Selah.

<span id="an_61:5">61:5</span> For Thou, O God, hast hearkened to my
vows, Thou hast appointed the inheritance Of those fearing Thy name.

<span id="an_61:6">61:6</span> Days to the days of the king Thou addest,
His years as generation and generation.

<span id="an_61:7">61:7</span> He dwelleth to the age before God,
Kindness and truth appoint -- they keep him.

<span id="an_61:8">61:8</span> So do I praise Thy name for ever, When I
pay my vows day by day!

<span id="an_62:1">62:1</span> To the Overseer, for Jeduthun. -- A Psalm

salvation.

<span id="an_62:2">62:2</span> Only -- He \[is\] my rock, and my
salvation, My tower, I am not much moved.

<span id="an_62:3">62:3</span> Till when do ye devise mischief against a
man? Ye are destroyed all of you, As a wall inclined, a hedge that is
cast down.

<span id="an_62:4">62:4</span> Only -- from his excellency They have
consulted to drive away, They enjoy a lie, with their mouth they bless,
And with their heart revile. Selah.

<span id="an_62:5">62:5</span> Only -- for God, be silent, O my soul,
For from Him \[is\] my hope.

<span id="an_62:6">62:6</span> Only -- He \[is\] my rock and my
salvation, My tower, I am not moved.

<span id="an_62:7">62:7</span> On God \[is\] my salvation, and my

<span id="an_62:8">62:8</span> Trust in Him at all times, O people, Pour

<span id="an_62:9">62:9</span> Only -- vanity \[are\] the low, a lie the
high. In balances to go up they than vanity \[are\] lighter.

<span id="an_62:10">62:10</span> Trust not in oppression, And in robbery

<span id="an_62:11">62:11</span> Once hath God spoken, twice I heard
this, That \`strength \[is\] with God.'

<span id="an_62:12">62:12</span> And with Thee, O Lord, \[is\] kindness,
For Thou dost recompense to each, According to his work!

<span id="an_63:1">63:1</span> A Psalm of David, in his being in the
wilderness of Judah. O God, Thou \[art\] my God, earnestly do I seek
Thee, Thirsted for Thee hath my soul, Longed for Thee hath my flesh, In
a land dry and weary, without waters.

<span id="an_63:2">63:2</span> So in the sanctuary I have seen Thee, To
behold Thy strength and Thine honour.

<span id="an_63:3">63:3</span> Because better \[is\] Thy kindness than
life, My lips do praise Thee.

<span id="an_63:4">63:4</span> So I bless Thee in my life, in Thy name I
lift up my hands.

<span id="an_63:5">63:5</span> As \[with\] milk and fatness is my soul
satisfied, And \[with\] singing lips doth my mouth praise.

<span id="an_63:6">63:6</span> If I have remembered Thee on my couch, In
the watches -- I meditate on Thee.

<span id="an_63:7">63:7</span> For Thou hast been a help to me, And in
the shadow of Thy wings I sing.

<span id="an_63:8">63:8</span> Cleaved hath my soul after Thee, On me
hath Thy right hand taken hold.

<span id="an_63:9">63:9</span> And they who for desolation seek my soul,
Go in to the lower parts of the earth.

<span id="an_63:10">63:10</span> They cause him to run on the edge of
the sword, A portion for foxes they are.

<span id="an_63:11">63:11</span> And the king doth rejoice in God, Boast
himself doth every one swearing by Him, But stopped is the mouth of
those speaking lies!

<span id="an_64:1">64:1</span> To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David.
Hear, O God, my voice, in my meditation, From the fear of an enemy Thou
keepest my life,

<span id="an_64:2">64:2</span> Hidest me from the secret counsel of evil
doers, From the tumult of workers of iniquity.

<span id="an_64:3">64:3</span> Who sharpened as a sword their tongue,
They directed their arrow -- a bitter word.

<span id="an_64:4">64:4</span> To shoot in secret places the perfect,
Suddenly they shoot him, and fear not.

<span id="an_64:5">64:5</span> They strengthen for themselves an evil
thing, They recount of the hiding of snares, They have said, \`Who doth
look at it?'

<span id="an_64:6">64:6</span> They search out perverse things, \`We
perfected a searching search,' And the inward part of man, and the heart
\[are\] deep.

<span id="an_64:7">64:7</span> And God doth shoot them \[with\] an
arrow, Sudden have been their wounds,

<span id="an_64:8">64:8</span> And they cause him to stumble, Against
them \[is\] their own tongue, Every looker on them fleeth away.

<span id="an_64:9">64:9</span> And all men fear, and declare the work of
God, And His deed they have considered wisely.

<span id="an_64:10">64:10</span> The righteous doth rejoice in Jehovah,
And hath trusted in Him, And boast themselves do all the upright of
heart!

<span id="an_65:1">65:1</span> To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. A
Song. To Thee, silence -- praise, O God, \[is\] in Zion, And to Thee is
a vow completed.

<span id="an_65:2">65:2</span> Hearer of prayer, to Thee all flesh
cometh.

<span id="an_65:3">65:3</span> Matters of iniquities were mightier than
I, Our transgressions -- Thou dost cover them.

<span id="an_65:4">65:4</span> O the happiness of \[him whom\] Thou
choosest, And drawest near, he inhabiteth Thy courts, We are satisfied
with the goodness of Thy house, Thy holy temple.

<span id="an_65:5">65:5</span> By fearful things in righteousness Thou
answerest us, O God of our salvation, The confidence of all far off ends
of earth and sea.

<span id="an_65:6">65:6</span> Establishing mountains by His power, He
hath been girded with might,

<span id="an_65:7">65:7</span> Restraining the noise of seas, the noise
of their billows, And the multitude of the peoples.

<span id="an_65:8">65:8</span> And the inhabitants of the uttermost
parts From Thy signs are afraid, The outgoings of morning and evening
Thou causest to sing.

<span id="an_65:9">65:9</span> Thou hast inspected the earth, and
waterest it, Thou makest it very rich, the rivulet of God \[is\] full of
water, Thou preparest their corn, When thus Thou dost prepare it,

<span id="an_65:10">65:10</span> Its ridges have been filled, Deepened
hath been its furrow, With showers Thou dost soften it, Its springing up
Thou blessest.

<span id="an_65:11">65:11</span> Thou hast crowned the year of Thy
goodness, And Thy paths drop fatness.

<span id="an_65:12">65:12</span> Drop do the pastures of a wilderness,
And joy of the heights Thou girdest on.

<span id="an_65:13">65:13</span> Clothed have lambs the flock, And
valleys are covered with corn, They shout -- yea, they sing!

Shout ye to God, all the earth.

honourable His praise.

<span id="an_66:3">66:3</span> Say to God, \`How fearful \[are\] Thy
works, By the abundance of Thy strength, Thine enemies feign obedience
to Thee.

praise to Thee, they praise Thy name.' Selah.

<span id="an_66:5">66:5</span> Come ye, and see the works of God,
Fearful acts toward the sons of men.

<span id="an_66:6">66:6</span> He hath turned a sea to dry land, Through
a river they pass over on foot, There do we rejoice in Him.

among the nations do watch, The refractory exalt not themselves. Selah.

<span id="an_66:8">66:8</span> Bless, ye peoples, our God, And sound the
voice of His praise,

<span id="an_66:9">66:9</span> Who hath placed our soul in life, And
suffered not our feet to be moved.

<span id="an_66:10">66:10</span> For Thou hast tried us, O God, Thou
hast refined us as the refining of silver.

<span id="an_66:11">66:11</span> Thou hast brought us into a net, Thou
hast placed pressure on our loins.

<span id="an_66:12">66:12</span> Thou hast caused man to ride at our
head. We have entered into fire and into water, And Thou bringest us out
to a watered place.

<span id="an_66:13">66:13</span> I enter Thy house with burnt-offerings,
I complete to Thee my vows,

<span id="an_66:14">66:14</span> For opened were my lips, And my mouth
spake in my distress:

<span id="an_66:15">66:15</span> \`Burnt-offerings of fatlings I offer
to Thee, With perfume of rams, I prepare a bullock with he-goats.'

<span id="an_66:16">66:16</span> Come, hear, all ye who fear God, And I
recount what he did for my soul.

<span id="an_66:17">66:17</span> Unto Him \[with\] my mouth I have
called, And exaltation \[is\] under my tongue.

<span id="an_66:18">66:18</span> Iniquity, if I have seen in my heart,
The Lord doth not hear.

the voice of my prayer.

aside my prayer, And His loving-kindness, from me!

Thee do peoples, all of them.

David. Rise doth God -- scattered are His enemies! And those hating Him
flee from His face.

away, As the melting of wax before fire, The wicked perish at the
presence of God.

before God, And they joy with gladness.

<span id="an_68:4">68:4</span> Sing ye to God -- praise His name, Raise
up a highway for Him who is riding in deserts, In Jah \[is\] His name,

people, In Thy stepping through the wilderness, Selah.

<span id="an_68:8">68:8</span> The earth hath shaken, Yea, the heavens
have dropped before God, This Sinai -- before God, the God of Israel.

<span id="an_68:9">68:9</span> A shower of free-will gifts thou shakest
out, O God. Thine inheritance, when it hath been weary, Thou hast
established it.

preparest in Thy goodness for the poor, O God.

<span id="an_68:11">68:11</span> The Lord doth give the saying, The
female proclaimers \[are\] a numerous host.

female inhabitant of the house apportioneth spoil.

<span id="an_68:13">68:13</span> Though ye do lie between two
boundaries, Wings of a dove covered with silver, And her pinions with
yellow gold.

It doth snow in Salmon.

<span id="an_68:15">68:15</span> A hill of God \[is\] the hill of
Bashan, A hill of heights \[is\] the hill of Bashan.

thousands of changes, The Lord \[is\] among them, in Sinai, in the
sanctuary.

taken captive captivity, Thou hast taken gifts for men, That even the
refractory may rest, O Jah God.

layeth on us. God Himself \[is\] our salvation. Selah.

deliverances, And Jehovah Lord hath the outgoings of death.

enemies, The hairy crown of a habitual walker in his guilt.

<span id="an_68:22">68:22</span> The Lord said: \`From Bashan I bring
back, I bring back from the depths of the sea.

Goings of my God, my king, in the sanctuary.

\[are\] players on instruments, In the midst virgins playing with
timbrels.

strong, O God, this Thou hast wrought for us.

<span id="an_68:29">68:29</span> Because of Thy temple at Jerusalem, To
Thee do kings bring a present.

<span id="an_68:30">68:30</span> Rebuke a beast of the reeds, a company
of bulls, With calves of the peoples, Each humbling himself with pieces
of silver, Scatter Thou peoples delighting in conflicts.

<span id="an_68:31">68:31</span> Come do fat ones out of Egypt, Cush
causeth her hands to run to God.

<span id="an_69:1">69:1</span> To the Overseer. -- \`On the Lilies,' by
David. Save me, O God, for come have waters unto the soul.

<span id="an_69:2">69:2</span> I have sunk in deep mire, And there is no
standing, I have come into the depths of the waters, And a flood hath
overflown me.

<span id="an_69:3">69:3</span> I have been wearied with my calling,
Burnt hath been my throat, Consumed have been mine eyes, waiting for my
God.

<span id="an_69:4">69:4</span> Those hating me without cause Have been
more than the hairs of my head, Mighty have been my destroyers, My lying
enemies, That which I took not away -- I bring back.

<span id="an_69:5">69:5</span> O God, Thou -- Thou hast known Concerning
my overturn, And my desolations from Thee have not been hid.

<span id="an_69:6">69:6</span> Let not those waiting on Thee be ashamed
because of me, O Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, Let not those seeking Thee
Blush because of me, O God of Israel.

<span id="an_69:7">69:7</span> For because of Thee I have borne
reproach, Shame hath covered my face.

<span id="an_69:8">69:8</span> A stranger I have been to my brother, And
a foreigner to sons of my mother.

<span id="an_69:9">69:9</span> For zeal for Thy house hath consumed me,
And the reproaches of Thy reproachers Have fallen upon me.

<span id="an_69:10">69:10</span> And I weep in the fasting of my soul,
And it is for a reproach to me.

<span id="an_69:11">69:11</span> And I make my clothing sackcloth, And I
am to them for a simile.

<span id="an_69:12">69:12</span> Those sitting at the gate meditate
concerning me, And those drinking strong drink, Play on instruments.

<span id="an_69:13">69:13</span> And I -- my prayer \[is\] to Thee, O
Jehovah, A time of good pleasure, O God, In the abundance of Thy
kindness, Answer me in the truth of Thy salvation.

<span id="an_69:14">69:14</span> Deliver me from the mire, and let me
not sink, Let me be delivered from those hating me, And from deep places
of waters.

<span id="an_69:15">69:15</span> Let not a flood of waters overflow me,
Nor let the deep swallow me up, Nor let the pit shut her mouth upon me.

<span id="an_69:16">69:16</span> Answer me, O Jehovah, for good \[is\]
Thy kindness, According to the abundance Of Thy mercies turn Thou unto
me,

<span id="an_69:17">69:17</span> And hide not Thy face from Thy servant,
For I am in distress -- haste, answer me.

<span id="an_69:18">69:18</span> Be near unto my soul -- redeem it,
Because of mine enemies ransom me.

And my shame, and my blushing, Before Thee \[are\] all mine adversaries.

<span id="an_69:20">69:20</span> Reproach hath broken my heart, and I am
sick, And I look for a bemoaner, and there is none, And for comforters,
and I have found none.

my thirst cause me to drink vinegar.

<span id="an_69:22">69:22</span> Their table before them is for a snare,
And for a recompence -- for a trap.

<span id="an_69:23">69:23</span> Darkened are their eyes from seeing,
And their loins continually shake Thou.

<span id="an_69:24">69:24</span> Pour upon them Thine indignation, And
the fierceness of Thine anger doth seize them.

<span id="an_69:25">69:25</span> Their tower is desolated, In their
tents there is no dweller.

<span id="an_69:26">69:26</span> For they have pursued him Thou hast
smitten, And recount of the pain of Thy pierced ones.

<span id="an_69:27">69:27</span> Give punishment for their iniquity, And
they enter not into Thy righteousness.

<span id="an_69:28">69:28</span> They are blotted out of the book of
life, And with the righteous are not written.

<span id="an_69:29">69:29</span> And I \[am\] afflicted and pained, Thy
salvation, O God, doth set me on high.

<span id="an_69:30">69:30</span> I praise the name of God with a song,
And I magnify Him with thanksgiving,

<span id="an_69:31">69:31</span> And it is better to Jehovah than an ox,
A bullock -- horned -- hoofed.

<span id="an_69:32">69:32</span> The humble have seen -- they rejoice,
Ye who seek God -- and your heart liveth.

<span id="an_69:33">69:33</span> For Jehovah hearkeneth unto the needy,
And His bound ones He hath not despised.

<span id="an_69:34">69:34</span> The heavens and earth do praise Him,
Seas, and every moving thing in them.

<span id="an_69:35">69:35</span> For God doth save Zion, And doth build
the cities of Judah, And they have dwelt there, and possess it.

<span id="an_69:36">69:36</span> And the seed of His servants inherit
it, And those loving His name dwell in it!

<span id="an_70:1">70:1</span> To the Overseer, by David. -- \`To cause
to remember.' O God, to deliver me, O Jehovah, for my help, haste.

<span id="an_70:2">70:2</span> Let them be ashamed and confounded Who
are seeking my soul, Let them be turned backward and blush Who are
desiring my evil.

<span id="an_70:3">70:3</span> Let them turn back because of their
shame, Who are saying, \`Aha, aha.'

<span id="an_70:4">70:4</span> Let all those seeking Thee joy and be
glad in Thee, And let those loving Thy salvation Say continually, \`God
is magnified.'

<span id="an_70:5">70:5</span> And I \[am\] poor and needy, O God, haste
to me, My help and my deliverer \[art\] Thou, O Jehovah, tarry Thou not!

<span id="an_71:1">71:1</span> In Thee, O Jehovah, I have trusted, Let
me not be ashamed to the age.

<span id="an_71:2">71:2</span> In Thy righteousness Thou dost deliver
me, And dost cause me to escape, Incline unto me Thine ear, and save me.

<span id="an_71:3">71:3</span> Be to me for a rock -- a habitation, To
go in continually, Thou hast given command to save me, For my rock and
my bulwark \[art\] Thou.

<span id="an_71:4">71:4</span> O my God, cause me to escape From the
hand of the wicked, From the hand of the perverse and violent.

<span id="an_71:5">71:5</span> For Thou \[art\] my hope, O Lord Jehovah,
My trust from my youth.

<span id="an_71:6">71:6</span> By Thee I have been supported from the
womb, From my mother's bowels Thou dost cut me out, In Thee \[is\] my
praise continually.

<span id="an_71:7">71:7</span> As a wonder I have been to many, And Thou
\[art\] my strong refuge.

<span id="an_71:8">71:8</span> Filled is my mouth \[with\] Thy praise,
All the day \[with\] Thy beauty.

<span id="an_71:9">71:9</span> Cast me not off at the time of old age,
According to the consumption of my power forsake me not.

<span id="an_71:10">71:10</span> For mine enemies have spoken against
me, And those watching my soul have taken counsel together,

<span id="an_71:11">71:11</span> Saying, \`God hath forsaken him, Pursue
and catch him, for there is no deliverer.'

<span id="an_71:12">71:12</span> O God, be not far from me, O my God,
for my help make haste.

<span id="an_71:13">71:13</span> They are ashamed, they are consumed,
Who are opposing my soul, They are covered \[with\] reproach and
blushing, Who are seeking my evil,

<span id="an_71:14">71:14</span> And I continually do wait with hope,
And have added unto all Thy praise.

<span id="an_71:15">71:15</span> My mouth recounteth Thy righteousness,
All the day Thy salvation, For I have not known the numbers.

<span id="an_71:16">71:16</span> I come in the might of the Lord
Jehovah, I mention Thy righteousness -- Thine only.

<span id="an_71:17">71:17</span> God, Thou hast taught me from my youth,
And hitherto I declare Thy wonders.

<span id="an_71:18">71:18</span> And also unto old age and grey hairs, O
God, forsake me not, Till I declare Thy strength to a generation, To
every one that cometh Thy might.

<span id="an_71:19">71:19</span> And Thy righteousness, O God, \[is\]
unto the heights, Because Thou hast done great things, O God, who \[is\]
like Thee?

<span id="an_71:20">71:20</span> Because Thou hast showed me many and
sad distresses, Thou turnest back -- Thou revivest me, And from the
depths of the earth, Thou turnest back -- Thou bringest me up.

<span id="an_71:21">71:21</span> Thou dost increase my greatness, And
Thou surroundest -- Thou comfortest me,

<span id="an_71:22">71:22</span> I also thank Thee with a vessel of
psaltery, Thy truth, O my God, I sing to Thee with a harp, O Holy One of
Israel,

<span id="an_71:23">71:23</span> My lips cry aloud when I sing praise to
Thee, And my soul that Thou hast redeemed,

<span id="an_71:24">71:24</span> My tongue also all the day uttereth Thy
righteousness, Because ashamed -- because confounded, Have been those
seeking my evil!

<span id="an_72:1">72:1</span> By Solomon. O God, Thy judgments to the
king give, And Thy righteousness to the king's son.

<span id="an_72:2">72:2</span> He judgeth Thy people with righteousness,
And Thy poor with judgment.

<span id="an_72:3">72:3</span> The mountains bear peace to the people,
And the heights by righteousness.

<span id="an_72:4">72:4</span> He judgeth the poor of the people, Giveth
deliverance to the sons of the needy, And bruiseth the oppressor.

<span id="an_72:5">72:5</span> They fear Thee with the sun, and before
the moon, Generation -- generations.

<span id="an_72:6">72:6</span> He cometh down as rain on mown grass, As
showers -- sprinkling the earth.

<span id="an_72:7">72:7</span> Flourish in his days doth the righteous,
And abundance of peace till the moon is not.

<span id="an_72:8">72:8</span> And he ruleth from sea unto sea, And from
the river unto the ends of earth.

<span id="an_72:9">72:9</span> Before him bow do the inhabitants of the
dry places, And his enemies lick the dust.

<span id="an_72:10">72:10</span> Kings of Tarshish and of the isles send
back a present. Kings of Sheba and Seba a reward bring near.

<span id="an_72:11">72:11</span> And all kings do bow themselves to him,
All nations do serve him,

<span id="an_72:12">72:12</span> For he delivereth the needy who crieth,
And the poor when he hath no helper,

<span id="an_72:13">72:13</span> He hath pity on the poor and needy, And
the souls of the needy he saveth,

<span id="an_72:14">72:14</span> From fraud and from violence he
redeemeth their soul, And precious is their blood in his eyes.

<span id="an_72:15">72:15</span> And he liveth, and giveth to him of the
gold of Sheba, And prayeth for him continually, All the day he doth
bless him.

<span id="an_72:16">72:16</span> There is a handful of corn in the
earth, On the top of mountains, Shake like Lebanon doth its fruit, And
they flourish out of the city as the herb of the earth.

<span id="an_72:17">72:17</span> His name is to the age, Before the sun
is his name continued, And they bless themselves in him, All nations do
pronounce him happy.

<span id="an_72:18">72:18</span> Blessed is Jehovah God, God of Israel,
He alone is doing wonders,

<span id="an_72:19">72:19</span> And blessed \[is\] the Name of His
honour to the age, And the whole earth is filled \[with\] His honour.
Amen, and amen!

<span id="an_72:20">72:20</span> The prayers of David son of Jesse have
been ended.

<span id="an_73:1">73:1</span> A Psalm of Asaph. Only -- good to Israel
\[is\] God, to the clean of heart. And I -- as a little thing, My feet
have been turned aside,

<span id="an_73:2">73:2</span> As nothing, have my steps slipped, For I
have been envious of the boastful,

<span id="an_73:3">73:3</span> The peace of the wicked I see, That there
are no bands at their death,

<span id="an_73:4">73:4</span> And their might \[is\] firm.

<span id="an_73:5">73:5</span> In the misery of mortals they are not,
And with common men they are not plagued.

<span id="an_73:6">73:6</span> Therefore hath pride encircled them,
Violence covereth them as a dress.

<span id="an_73:7">73:7</span> Their eye hath come out from fat. The
imaginations of the heart transgressed;

<span id="an_73:8">73:8</span> They do corruptly, And they speak in the
wickedness of oppression, From on high they speak.

<span id="an_73:9">73:9</span> They have set in the heavens their mouth,
And their tongue walketh in the earth.

<span id="an_73:10">73:10</span> Therefore do His people return hither,
And waters of fulness are wrung out to them.

<span id="an_73:11">73:11</span> And they have said, \`How hath God
known? And is there knowledge in the Most High?'

<span id="an_73:12">73:12</span> Lo, these \[are\] the wicked and easy
ones of the age, They have increased strength.

<span id="an_73:13">73:13</span> Only -- a vain thing! I have purified
my heart, And I wash in innocency my hands,

<span id="an_73:14">73:14</span> And I am plagued all the day, And my
reproof \[is\] every morning.

<span id="an_73:15">73:15</span> If I have said, \`I recount thus,' Lo,
a generation of Thy sons I have deceived.

<span id="an_73:16">73:16</span> And I think to know this, Perverseness
it \[is\] in mine eyes,

<span id="an_73:17">73:17</span> Till I come in to the sanctuaries of
God, I attend to their latter end.

<span id="an_73:18">73:18</span> Only, in slippery places Thou dost set
them, Thou hast caused them to fall to desolations.

<span id="an_73:19">73:19</span> How have they become a desolation as in
a moment, They have been ended -- consumed from terrors.

<span id="an_73:20">73:20</span> As a dream from awakening, O Lord, In
awaking, their image Thou despisest.

<span id="an_73:21">73:21</span> For my heart doth show itself violent,
And my reins prick themselves,

<span id="an_73:22">73:22</span> And I am brutish, and do not know. A
beast I have been with Thee.

<span id="an_73:23">73:23</span> And I \[am\] continually with Thee,
Thou hast laid hold on my right hand.

<span id="an_73:24">73:24</span> With Thy counsel Thou dost lead me, And
after honour dost receive me.

<span id="an_73:25">73:25</span> Whom have I in the heavens? And with
Thee none I have desired in earth.

<span id="an_73:26">73:26</span> Consumed hath been my flesh and my
heart, The rock of my heart and my portion \[is\] God to the age.

<span id="an_73:27">73:27</span> For, lo, those far from Thee do perish,
Thou hast cut off every one, Who is going a whoring from Thee.

<span id="an_73:28">73:28</span> And I -- nearness of God to me \[is\]
good, I have placed in the Lord Jehovah my refuge, To recount all Thy
works!

<span id="an_74:1">74:1</span> An Instruction of Asaph. Why, O God, hast
Thou cast off for ever? Thine anger smoketh against the flock of Thy
pasture.

<span id="an_74:2">74:2</span> Remember Thy company. Thou didst purchase
of old, Thou didst redeem the rod of Thy inheritance, This mount Zion --
Thou didst dwell in it.

<span id="an_74:3">74:3</span> Lift up Thy steps to the perpetual
desolations, Everything the enemy did wickedly in the sanctuary.

<span id="an_74:4">74:4</span> Roared have thine adversaries, In the
midst of Thy meeting-places, They have set their ensigns as ensigns.

<span id="an_74:5">74:5</span> He is known as one bringing in on high
Against a thicket of wood -- axes.

<span id="an_74:6">74:6</span> And now, its carvings together With axe
and hatchet they break down,

<span id="an_74:7">74:7</span> They have sent into fire Thy sanctuary,
to the earth they polluted the tabernacle of Thy name,

<span id="an_74:8">74:8</span> They said in their hearts, \`Let us
oppress them together,' They did burn all the meeting-places of God in
the land.

<span id="an_74:9">74:9</span> Our ensigns we have not seen, There is no
more a prophet, Nor with us is one knowing how long.

<span id="an_74:10">74:10</span> Till when, O God, doth an adversary
reproach? Doth an enemy despise thy name for ever?

<span id="an_74:11">74:11</span> Why dost Thou turn back Thy hand, Even
Thy right hand? From the midst of Thy bosom remove \[it\].

<span id="an_74:12">74:12</span> And God \[is\] my king of old, Working
salvation in the midst of the earth.

<span id="an_74:13">74:13</span> Thou hast broken by Thy strength a
sea-\[monster\], Thou hast shivered Heads of dragons by the waters,

<span id="an_74:14">74:14</span> Thou hast broken the heads of
leviathan, Thou makest him food, For the people of the dry places.

<span id="an_74:15">74:15</span> Thou hast cleaved a fountain and a
stream, Thou hast dried up perennial flowings.

<span id="an_74:16">74:16</span> Thine \[is\] the day, also Thine \[is\]
the night, Thou hast prepared a light giver -- the sun.

<span id="an_74:17">74:17</span> Thou hast set up all the borders of
earth, Summer and winter Thou hast formed them.

<span id="an_74:18">74:18</span> Remember this -- an enemy reproached
Jehovah, And a foolish people have despised Thy name.

<span id="an_74:19">74:19</span> Give not up to a company, The soul of
Thy turtle-dove, The company of Thy poor ones forget not for ever.

<span id="an_74:20">74:20</span> Look attentively to the covenant, For
the dark places of earth, Have been full of habitations of violence.

<span id="an_74:21">74:21</span> Let not the oppressed turn back
ashamed, Let the poor and needy praise Thy name,

<span id="an_74:22">74:22</span> Arise, O God, plead Thy plea, Remember
Thy reproach from a fool all the day.

<span id="an_74:23">74:23</span> Forget not the voice of Thine
adversaries, The noise of Thy withstanders is going up continually!

<span id="an_75:1">75:1</span> To the Overseer. -- \`Destroy not.' -- A
Psalm of Asaph. -- A Song. We have given thanks to Thee, O God, We have
given thanks, and near \[is\] Thy name, They have recounted Thy wonders.

<span id="an_75:2">75:2</span> When I receive an appointment, I -- I do
judge uprightly.

<span id="an_75:3">75:3</span> Melted is the earth and all its
inhabitants, I -- I have pondered its pillars. Selah.

<span id="an_75:4">75:4</span> I have said to the boastful, \`Be not
boastful,' And to the wicked, \`Raise not up a horn.'

<span id="an_75:5">75:5</span> Raise not up on high your horn, (Ye speak
with a stiff neck.)

<span id="an_75:6">75:6</span> For not from the east, or from the west,
Nor from the wilderness -- \[is\] elevation.

<span id="an_75:7">75:7</span> But God \[is\] judge, This He maketh low
-- and this He lifteth up.

<span id="an_75:8">75:8</span> For a cup \[is\] in the hand of Jehovah,
And the wine hath foamed, It is full of mixture, and He poureth out of
it, Only its dregs wring out, and drink, Do all the wicked of the earth,

<span id="an_75:9">75:9</span> And I -- I declare \[it\] to the age, I
sing praise to the God of Jacob.

<span id="an_75:10">75:10</span> And all horns of the wicked I cut off,
Exalted are the horns of the righteous!

<span id="an_76:1">76:1</span> To the Overseer with stringed
instruments. -- A Psalm of Asaph. -- A Song. In Judah \[is\] God known,
in Israel His name \[is\] great.

<span id="an_76:2">76:2</span> And His tabernacle is in Salem, And His
habitation in Zion.

<span id="an_76:3">76:3</span> There he hath shivered arrows of a bow,
Shield, and sword, and battle. Selah.

<span id="an_76:4">76:4</span> Bright \[art\] Thou, honourable above
hills of prey.

<span id="an_76:5">76:5</span> Spoiled themselves have the mighty of
heart, They have slept their sleep, And none of the men of might found
their hands.

<span id="an_76:6">76:6</span> From Thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both
rider and horse have been fast asleep.

<span id="an_76:7">76:7</span> Thou, fearful \[art\] Thou, And who doth
stand before Thee, Since Thou hast been angry!

<span id="an_76:8">76:8</span> From heaven Thou hast sounded judgment,
Earth hath feared, and hath been still,

<span id="an_76:9">76:9</span> In the rising of God to judgment, To save
all the humble of earth. Selah.

<span id="an_76:10">76:10</span> For the fierceness of man praiseth
Thee, The remnant of fierceness Thou girdest on.

<span id="an_76:11">76:11</span> Vow and complete to Jehovah your God,
All ye surrounding him. They bring presents to the Fearful One.

<span id="an_76:12">76:12</span> He doth gather the spirit of leaders,
Fearful to the kings of earth!

<span id="an_77:1">77:1</span> To the Overseer, for Jeduthun. -- A Psalm
of Asaph. My voice \[is\] to God, and I cry, my voice \[is\] to God, And
He hath given ear unto me.

<span id="an_77:2">77:2</span> In a day of my distress the Lord I
sought, My hand by night hath been spread out, And it doth not cease, My
soul hath refused to be comforted.

<span id="an_77:3">77:3</span> I remember God, and make a noise, I
meditate, and feeble is my spirit. Selah.

<span id="an_77:4">77:4</span> Thou hast taken hold of the watches of
mine eyes, I have been moved, and I speak not.

<span id="an_77:5">77:5</span> I have reckoned the days of old, The
years of the ages.

<span id="an_77:6">77:6</span> I remember my music in the night, With my
heart I meditate, and my spirit doth search diligently:

<span id="an_77:7">77:7</span> To the ages doth the Lord cast off? Doth
He add to be pleased no more?

<span id="an_77:8">77:8</span> Hath His kindness ceased for ever? The
saying failed to all generations?

<span id="an_77:9">77:9</span> Hath God forgotten \[His\] favours? Hath
He shut up in anger His mercies? Selah.

<span id="an_77:10">77:10</span> And I say: \`My weakness is, The
changes of the right hand of the Most High.'

<span id="an_77:11">77:11</span> I mention the doings of Jah, For I
remember of old Thy wonders,

<span id="an_77:12">77:12</span> And I have meditated on all Thy
working, And I talk concerning Thy doings.

<span id="an_77:13">77:13</span> O God, in holiness \[is\] Thy way, Who
\[is\] a great god like God?

<span id="an_77:14">77:14</span> Thou \[art\] the God doing wonders.
Thou hast made known among the peoples Thy strength,

<span id="an_77:15">77:15</span> Thou hast redeemed with strength Thy
people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.

<span id="an_77:16">77:16</span> The waters have seen Thee, O God, The
waters have seen Thee, They are afraid -- also depths are troubled.

<span id="an_77:17">77:17</span> Poured out waters have thick clouds,
The skies have given forth a noise, Also -- Thine arrows go up and down.

<span id="an_77:18">77:18</span> The voice of Thy thunder \[is\] in the
spheres, Lightnings have lightened the world, The earth hath trembled,
yea, it shaketh.

<span id="an_77:19">77:19</span> In the sea \[is\] Thy way, And Thy
paths \[are\] in many waters, And Thy tracks have not been known.

<span id="an_77:20">77:20</span> Thou hast led as a flock Thy people, By
the hand of Moses and Aaron!

<span id="an_78:1">78:1</span> An Instruction of Asaph. Give ear, O my
people, to my law, Incline your ear to sayings of my mouth.

<span id="an_78:2">78:2</span> I open with a simile my mouth, I bring
forth hidden things of old,

<span id="an_78:3">78:3</span> That we have heard and do know, And our
fathers have recounted to us.

<span id="an_78:4">78:4</span> We do not hide from their sons, To a
later generation recounting praises of Jehovah, And His strength, and
His wonders that He hath done.

<span id="an_78:5">78:5</span> And He raiseth up a testimony in Jacob,
And a law hath placed in Israel, That He commanded our fathers, To make
them known to their sons.

<span id="an_78:6">78:6</span> So that a later generation doth know,
Sons who are born, do rise and recount to their sons,

<span id="an_78:7">78:7</span> And place in God their confidence, And
forget not the doings of God, But keep His commands.

<span id="an_78:8">78:8</span> And they are not like their fathers, A
generation apostate and rebellious, A generation! it hath not prepared
its heart, Nor stedfast with God \[is\] its spirit.

<span id="an_78:9">78:9</span> Sons of Ephraim -- armed bearers of bow,
Have turned in a day of conflict.

<span id="an_78:10">78:10</span> They have not kept the covenant of God,
And in His law they have refused to walk,

<span id="an_78:11">78:11</span> And they forget His doings, And His
wonders that He shewed them.

<span id="an_78:12">78:12</span> Before their fathers He hath done
wonders, In the land of Egypt -- the field of Zoan.

<span id="an_78:13">78:13</span> He cleft a sea, and causeth them to
pass over, Yea, He causeth waters to stand as a heap.

<span id="an_78:14">78:14</span> And leadeth them with a cloud by day,
And all the night with a light of fire.

<span id="an_78:15">78:15</span> He cleaveth rocks in a wilderness, And
giveth drink -- as the great deep.

<span id="an_78:16">78:16</span> And bringeth out streams from a rock,
And causeth waters to come down as rivers.

<span id="an_78:17">78:17</span> And they add still to sin against Him,
To provoke the Most High in the dry place.

<span id="an_78:18">78:18</span> And they try God in their heart, To ask
food for their lust.

<span id="an_78:19">78:19</span> And they speak against God -- they
said: \`Is God able to array a table in a wilderness?'

<span id="an_78:20">78:20</span> Lo, He hath smitten a rock, And waters
flow, yea, streams overflow. \`Also -- bread \[is\] He able to give?
Doth He prepare flesh for His people?'

<span id="an_78:21">78:21</span> Therefore hath Jehovah heard, And He
sheweth Himself wroth, And fire hath been kindled against Jacob, And
anger also hath gone up against Israel,

<span id="an_78:22">78:22</span> For they have not believed in God, Nor
have they trusted in His salvation.

<span id="an_78:23">78:23</span> And He commandeth clouds from above,
Yea, doors of the heavens He hath opened.

<span id="an_78:24">78:24</span> And He raineth on them manna to eat,
Yea, corn of heaven He hath given to them.

<span id="an_78:25">78:25</span> Food of the mighty hath each eaten,
Venison He sent to them to satiety.

<span id="an_78:26">78:26</span> He causeth an east wind to journey in
the heavens, And leadeth by His strength a south wind,

<span id="an_78:27">78:27</span> And He raineth on them flesh as dust,
And as sand of the seas -- winged fowl,

<span id="an_78:28">78:28</span> And causeth \[it\] to fall in the midst
of His camp, Round about His tabernacles.

<span id="an_78:29">78:29</span> And they eat, and are greatly
satisfied, And their desire He bringeth to them.

<span id="an_78:30">78:30</span> They have not been estranged from their
desire, Yet \[is\] their food in their mouth,

<span id="an_78:31">78:31</span> And the anger of God hath gone up
against them, And He slayeth among their fat ones, And youths of Israel
He caused to bend.

<span id="an_78:32">78:32</span> With all this they have sinned again,
And have not believed in His wonders.

<span id="an_78:33">78:33</span> And He consumeth in vanity their days,
And their years in trouble.

<span id="an_78:34">78:34</span> If He slew them, then they sought Him,
And turned back, and sought God earnestly,

<span id="an_78:35">78:35</span> And they remember that God \[is\] their
rock, And God Most High their redeemer.

<span id="an_78:36">78:36</span> And -- they deceive Him with their
mouth, And with their tongue do lie to Him,

<span id="an_78:37">78:37</span> And their heart hath not been right
with Him, And they have not been stedfast in His covenant.

<span id="an_78:38">78:38</span> And He -- the Merciful One, Pardoneth
iniquity, and destroyeth not, And hath often turned back His anger, And
waketh not up all His fury.

<span id="an_78:39">78:39</span> And He remembereth that they \[are\]
flesh, A wind going on -- and it returneth not.

<span id="an_78:40">78:40</span> How often do they provoke Him in the
wilderness, Grieve Him in the desolate place?

<span id="an_78:41">78:41</span> Yea, they turn back, and try God, And
the Holy One of Israel have limited.

<span id="an_78:42">78:42</span> They have not remembered His hand The
day He ransomed them from the adversary.

<span id="an_78:43">78:43</span> When He set His signs in Egypt, And His
wonders in the field of Zoan,

<span id="an_78:44">78:44</span> And He turneth to blood their streams,
And their floods they drink not.

<span id="an_78:45">78:45</span> He sendeth among them the beetle, and
it consumeth them, And the frog, and it destroyeth them,

<span id="an_78:46">78:46</span> And giveth to the caterpillar their
increase, And their labour to the locust.

<span id="an_78:47">78:47</span> He destroyeth with hail their vine, And
their sycamores with frost,

<span id="an_78:48">78:48</span> And delivereth up to the hail their
beasts, And their cattle to the burning flames.

<span id="an_78:49">78:49</span> He sendeth on them the fury of His
anger, Wrath, and indignation, and distress -- A discharge of evil
messengers.

<span id="an_78:50">78:50</span> He pondereth a path for His anger, He
kept not back their soul from death, Yea, their life to the pestilence
He delivered up.

<span id="an_78:51">78:51</span> And He smiteth every first-born in
Egypt, The first-fruit of the strong in tents of Ham.

<span id="an_78:52">78:52</span> And causeth His people to journey as a
flock, And guideth them as a drove in a wilderness,

<span id="an_78:53">78:53</span> And He leadeth them confidently, And
they have not been afraid, And their enemies hath the sea covered.

<span id="an_78:54">78:54</span> And He bringeth them in unto the border
of His sanctuary, This mountain His right hand had got,

<span id="an_78:55">78:55</span> And casteth out nations from before
them, And causeth them to fall in the line of inheritance, And causeth
the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents,

<span id="an_78:56">78:56</span> And they tempt and provoke God Most
High, And His testimonies have not kept.

<span id="an_78:57">78:57</span> And they turn back, And deal
treacherously like their fathers, They have been turned like a deceitful
bow,

<span id="an_78:58">78:58</span> And make Him angry with their high
places, And with their graven images make Him zealous,

<span id="an_78:59">78:59</span> God hath heard, and sheweth Himself
wroth. And kicketh exceedingly against Israel.

<span id="an_78:60">78:60</span> And He leaveth the tabernacle of
Shiloh, The tent He had placed among men,

<span id="an_78:61">78:61</span> And He giveth His strength to
captivity, And His beauty into the hand of an adversary,

<span id="an_78:62">78:62</span> And delivereth up to the sword His
people, And with His inheritance shewed Himself angry.

<span id="an_78:63">78:63</span> His young men hath fire consumed, And
His virgins have not been praised.

<span id="an_78:64">78:64</span> His priests by the sword have fallen,
And their widows weep not.

<span id="an_78:65">78:65</span> And the Lord waketh as a sleeper, As a
mighty one crying aloud from wine.

<span id="an_78:66">78:66</span> And He smiteth His adversaries
backward, A reproach age-during He hath put on them,

<span id="an_78:67">78:67</span> And He kicketh against the tent of
Joseph, And on the tribe of Ephraim hath not fixed.

<span id="an_78:68">78:68</span> And He chooseth the tribe of Judah,
With mount Zion that He loved,

<span id="an_78:69">78:69</span> And buildeth His sanctuary as a high
place, Like the earth, He founded it to the age.

<span id="an_78:70">78:70</span> And He fixeth on David His servant, And
taketh him from the folds of a flock,

<span id="an_78:71">78:71</span> From behind suckling ones He hath
brought him in, To rule over Jacob His people, And over Israel His
inheritance.

<span id="an_78:72">78:72</span> And he ruleth them according to the
integrity of his heart, And by the skilfulness of his hands leadeth
them!

<span id="an_79:1">79:1</span> A Psalm of Asaph. O God, nations have
come into Thy inheritance, They have defiled Thy holy temple, They made
Jerusalem become heaps,

<span id="an_79:2">79:2</span> They gave the dead bodies of Thy servants
Food for the fowls of the heavens, The flesh of Thy saints For the wild
beast of the earth.

<span id="an_79:3">79:3</span> They have shed their blood As water round
about Jerusalem, And there is none burying.

<span id="an_79:4">79:4</span> We have been a reproach to our
neighbours, A scorn and a derision to our surrounders.

<span id="an_79:5">79:5</span> Till when, O Jehovah? art Thou angry for
ever? Thy jealousy doth burn as fire.

<span id="an_79:6">79:6</span> Pour Thy fury on the nations who have not
known Thee, And on kingdoms that have not called in Thy name.

<span id="an_79:7">79:7</span> For \[one\] hath devoured Jacob, And his
habitation they have made desolate.

<span id="an_79:8">79:8</span> Remember not for us the iniquities of
forefathers, Haste, let Thy mercies go before us, For we have been very
weak.

<span id="an_79:9">79:9</span> Help us, O God of our salvation, Because
of the honour of Thy name, And deliver us, and cover over our sins, For
Thy name's sake.

<span id="an_79:10">79:10</span> Why do the nations say, \`Where \[is\]
their God?' Let be known among the nations before our eyes, The
vengeance of the blood of Thy servants that is shed.

<span id="an_79:11">79:11</span> Let the groaning of the prisoner come
in before Thee, According to the greatness of Thine arm, Leave Thou the
sons of death.

<span id="an_79:12">79:12</span> And turn Thou back to our neighbours,
Sevenfold unto their bosom, their reproach, Wherewith they reproached
Thee, O Lord.

<span id="an_79:13">79:13</span> And we, Thy people, and the flock of
Thy pasture, We give thanks to Thee to the age, To all generations we
recount Thy praise!

<span id="an_80:1">80:1</span> To the Overseer. -- \`On the Lilies.' A
testimony of Asaph. -- A Psalm. Shepherd of Israel, give ear, Leading
Joseph as a flock, Inhabiting the cherubs -- shine forth,

<span id="an_80:2">80:2</span> Before Ephraim, and Benjamin, and
Manasseh, Wake up Thy might, and come for our salvation.

<span id="an_80:3">80:3</span> O God, cause us to turn back, And cause
Thy face to shine, and we are saved.

<span id="an_80:4">80:4</span> Jehovah, God of Hosts, till when? Thou
hast burned against the prayer of Thy people.

<span id="an_80:5">80:5</span> Thou hast caused them to eat bread of
tears, And causest them to drink With tears a third time.

<span id="an_80:6">80:6</span> Thou makest us a strife to our neighbors,
And our enemies mock at it.

<span id="an_80:7">80:7</span> God of Hosts, turn us back, And cause Thy
face to shine, and we are saved.

<span id="an_80:8">80:8</span> A vine out of Egypt Thou dost bring, Thou
dost cast out nations, and plantest it.

<span id="an_80:9">80:9</span> Thou hast looked before it, and dost root
it, And it filleth the land,

<span id="an_80:10">80:10</span> Covered have been hills \[with\] its
shadow, And its boughs \[are\] cedars of God.

<span id="an_80:11">80:11</span> It sendeth forth its branches unto the
sea, And unto the river its sucklings.

<span id="an_80:12">80:12</span> Why hast Thou broken down its hedges,
And all passing by the way have plucked it?

<span id="an_80:13">80:13</span> A boar out of the forest doth waste it,
And a wild beast of the fields consumeth it.

<span id="an_80:14">80:14</span> God of Hosts, turn back, we beseech
Thee, Look from heaven, and see, and inspect this vine,

<span id="an_80:15">80:15</span> And the root that Thy right hand
planted, And the branch Thou madest strong for Thee,

<span id="an_80:16">80:16</span> Burnt with fire -- cut down, From the
rebuke of Thy face they perish.

<span id="an_80:17">80:17</span> Let Thy hand be on the man of Thy right
hand, On the son of man Thou hast strengthened for Thyself.

<span id="an_80:18">80:18</span> And we do not go back from Thee, Thou
dost revive us, and in Thy name we call.

<span id="an_80:19">80:19</span> O Jehovah, God of Hosts, turn us back,
Cause Thy face to shine, and we are saved!

<span id="an_81:1">81:1</span> To the Overseer. -- \`On the Gittith.' By
Asaph. Cry aloud to God our strength, Shout to the God of Jacob.

<span id="an_81:2">81:2</span> Lift up a song, and give out a timbrel, A
pleasant harp with psaltery.

<span id="an_81:3">81:3</span> Blow in the month a trumpet, In the new
moon, at the day of our festival,

<span id="an_81:4">81:4</span> For a statute to Israel it \[is\], An
ordinance of the God of Jacob.

<span id="an_81:5">81:5</span> A testimony on Joseph He hath placed it,
In his going forth over the land of Egypt. A lip, I have not known -- I
hear.

<span id="an_81:6">81:6</span> From the burden his shoulder I turned
aside, His hands from the basket pass over.

<span id="an_81:7">81:7</span> In distress thou hast called and I
deliver thee, I answer thee in the secret place of thunder, I try thee
by the waters of Meribah. Selah.

<span id="an_81:8">81:8</span> Hear, O My people, and I testify to thee,
O Israel, if thou dost hearken to me:

<span id="an_81:9">81:9</span> There is not in thee a strange god, And
thou bowest not thyself to a strange god.

<span id="an_81:10">81:10</span> I \[am\] Jehovah thy God, Who bringeth
thee up out of the land of Egypt. Enlarge thy mouth, and I fill it.

<span id="an_81:11">81:11</span> But, My people hearkened not to My
voice, And Israel hath not consented to Me.

<span id="an_81:12">81:12</span> And I send them away in the enmity of
their heart, They walk in their own counsels.

<span id="an_81:13">81:13</span> O that My people were hearkening to Me,
Israel in My ways would walk.

<span id="an_81:14">81:14</span> As a little thing their enemies I cause
to bow, And against their adversaries I turn back My hand,

<span id="an_81:15">81:15</span> Those hating Jehovah feign obedience to
Him, But their time is -- to the age.

<span id="an_81:16">81:16</span> He causeth him to eat of the fat of
wheat, And \[with\] honey from a rock I satisfy thee!

<span id="an_82:1">82:1</span> -- A Psalm of Asaph. God hath stood in
the company of God, In the midst God doth judge.

<span id="an_82:2">82:2</span> Till when do ye judge perversely? And the
face of the wicked lift up? Selah.

<span id="an_82:3">82:3</span> Judge ye the weak and fatherless, The
afflicted and the poor declare righteous.

<span id="an_82:4">82:4</span> Let the weak and needy escape, From the
hand of the wicked deliver them.

<span id="an_82:5">82:5</span> They knew not, nor do they understand, In
darkness they walk habitually, Moved are all the foundations of earth.

<span id="an_82:6">82:6</span> I -- I have said, \`Gods ye \[are\], And
sons of the Most High -- all of you,

<span id="an_82:7">82:7</span> But as man ye die, and as one of the
heads ye fall,

<span id="an_82:8">82:8</span> Rise, O God, judge the earth, For Thou
hast inheritance among all the nations!

<span id="an_83:1">83:1</span> A Song, -- A Psalm of Asaph. O God, let
there be no silence to Thee, Be not silent, nor be quiet, O God.

<span id="an_83:2">83:2</span> For, lo, Thine enemies do roar, And those
hating Thee have lifted up the head,

<span id="an_83:3">83:3</span> Against Thy people they take crafty
counsel, And consult against Thy hidden ones.

<span id="an_83:4">83:4</span> They have said, \`Come, And we cut them
off from \[being\] a nation, And the name of Israel is not remembered
any more.'

<span id="an_83:5">83:5</span> For they consulted in heart together,
Against Thee a covenant they make,

<span id="an_83:6">83:6</span> Tents of Edom, and Ishmaelites, Moab, and
the Hagarenes,

<span id="an_83:7">83:7</span> Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek, Philistia
with inhabitants of Tyre,

<span id="an_83:8">83:8</span> Asshur also is joined with them, They
have been an arm to sons of Lot. Selah.

<span id="an_83:9">83:9</span> Do to them as \[to\] Midian, As \[to\]
Sisera, as \[to\] Jabin, at the stream Kishon.

<span id="an_83:10">83:10</span> They were destroyed at Endor, They were
dung for the ground!

<span id="an_83:11">83:11</span> Make their nobles as Oreb and as Zeeb,
And as Zebah and Zalmunna all their princes,

<span id="an_83:12">83:12</span> Who have said, \`Let us occupy for
ourselves The comely places of God.'

<span id="an_83:13">83:13</span> O my God, make them as a rolling thing,
As stubble before wind.

<span id="an_83:14">83:14</span> As a fire doth burn a forest, And as a
flame setteth hills on fire,

<span id="an_83:15">83:15</span> So dost Thou pursue them with Thy
whirlwind, And with Thy hurricane troublest them.

<span id="an_83:16">83:16</span> Fill their faces \[with\] shame, And
they seek Thy name, O Jehovah.

<span id="an_83:17">83:17</span> They are ashamed and troubled for ever,
Yea, they are confounded and lost.

<span id="an_83:18">83:18</span> And they know that Thou -- (Thy name
\[is\] Jehovah -- by Thyself,) \[Art\] the Most High over all the earth!

<span id="an_84:1">84:1</span> To the Overseer. -- \`On the Gittith By
sons of Korah.' -- A Psalm. How beloved Thy tabernacles, Jehovah of
Hosts!

<span id="an_84:2">84:2</span> My soul desired, yea, it hath also been
consumed, For the courts of Jehovah, My heart and my flesh cry aloud
unto the living God,

<span id="an_84:3">84:3</span> (Even a sparrow hath found a house, And a
swallow a nest for herself, Where she hath placed her brood,) Thine
altars, O Jehovah of Hosts, My king and my God.

<span id="an_84:4">84:4</span> O the happiness of those inhabiting Thy
house, Yet do they praise Thee. Selah.

<span id="an_84:5">84:5</span> O the happiness of a man whose strength
is in Thee, Highways \[are\] in their heart.

<span id="an_84:6">84:6</span> Those passing through a valley of
weeping, A fountain do make it, Blessings also cover the director.

<span id="an_84:7">84:7</span> They go from strength unto strength, He
appeareth unto God in Zion.

<span id="an_84:8">84:8</span> O Jehovah, God of Hosts, hear my prayer,
Give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.

<span id="an_84:9">84:9</span> Our shield, see, O God, And behold the
face of Thine anointed,

<span id="an_84:10">84:10</span> For good \[is\] a day in Thy courts, O
Teacher! I have chosen rather to be at the threshold, In the house of my
God, Than to dwell in tents of wickedness.

<span id="an_84:11">84:11</span> For a sun and a shield \[is\] Jehovah
God, Grace and honour doth Jehovah give. He withholdeth not good To
those walking in uprightness.

<span id="an_84:12">84:12</span> Jehovah of Hosts! O the happiness of a
man trusting in Thee.

<span id="an_85:1">85:1</span> To the Overseer. -- By sons of Korah. A
Psalm. Thou hast accepted, O Jehovah, Thy land, Thou hast turned \[to\]
the captivity of Jacob.

<span id="an_85:2">85:2</span> Thou hast borne away the iniquity of Thy
people, Thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.

<span id="an_85:3">85:3</span> Thou hast gathered up all Thy wrath, Thou
hast turned back from the fierceness of Thine anger.

<span id="an_85:4">85:4</span> Turn back \[to\] us, O God of our
salvation, And make void Thine anger with us.

<span id="an_85:5">85:5</span> To the age art Thou angry against us?
Dost Thou draw out Thine anger To generation and generation?

<span id="an_85:6">85:6</span> Dost Thou not turn back? Thou revivest
us, And Thy people do rejoice in Thee.

<span id="an_85:7">85:7</span> Show us, O Jehovah, thy kindness, And Thy
salvation Thou dost give to us.

<span id="an_85:8">85:8</span> I hear what God Jehovah speaketh, For He
speaketh peace unto His people, And unto His saints, and they turn not
back to folly.

<span id="an_85:9">85:9</span> Only, near to those fearing Him \[is\]
His salvation, That honour may dwell in our land.

<span id="an_85:10">85:10</span> Kindness and truth have met,
Righteousness and peace have kissed,

<span id="an_85:11">85:11</span> Truth from the earth springeth up, And
righteousness from heaven looketh out,

<span id="an_85:12">85:12</span> Jehovah also giveth that which is good,
And our land doth give its increase.

<span id="an_85:13">85:13</span> Righteousness before Him goeth, And
maketh His footsteps for a way!

<span id="an_86:1">86:1</span> A Prayer of David. Incline, O Jehovah,
Thine ear, Answer me, for I \[am\] poor and needy.

<span id="an_86:2">86:2</span> Keep my soul, for I \[am\] pious, Save
Thy servant -- who is trusting to Thee, O Thou, my God.

<span id="an_86:3">86:3</span> Favour me, O Lord, for to Thee I call all
the day.

<span id="an_86:4">86:4</span> Rejoice the soul of Thy servant, For unto
Thee, O Lord, my soul I lift up.

<span id="an_86:6">86:6</span> Hear, O Jehovah, my prayer, And attend to
the voice of my supplications.

<span id="an_86:7">86:7</span> In a day of my distress I call Thee, For
Thou dost answer me.

<span id="an_86:8">86:8</span> There is none like Thee among the gods, O

<span id="an_86:10">86:10</span> For great \[art\] Thou, and doing
wonders, Thou \[art\] God Thyself alone.

<span id="an_86:11">86:11</span> Show me, O Jehovah, Thy way, I walk in
Thy truth, My heart doth rejoice to fear Thy name.

<span id="an_86:12">86:12</span> I confess Thee, O Lord my God, with all
my heart, And I honour Thy name to the age.

<span id="an_86:13">86:13</span> For Thy kindness \[is\] great toward
me, And Thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.

<span id="an_86:14">86:14</span> O God, the proud have risen up against
me, And a company of the terrible sought my soul, And have not placed
Thee before them,

<span id="an_86:15">86:15</span> And Thou, O Lord, \[art\] God, merciful
and gracious, Slow to anger, and abundant in kindness and truth.

<span id="an_86:16">86:16</span> Look unto me, and favour me, Give Thy
strength to Thy servant, And give salvation to a son of Thine handmaid.

<span id="an_86:17">86:17</span> Do with me a sign for good, And those

Thine ear to my loud cry,

<span id="an_88:3">88:3</span> For my soul hath been full of evils, And
my life hath come to Sheol.

<span id="an_88:4">88:4</span> I have been reckoned with those going
down \[to\] the pit, I have been as a man without strength.

<span id="an_88:5">88:5</span> Among the dead -- free, As pierced ones
lying in the grave, Whom Thou hast not remembered any more, Yea, they by
Thy hand have been cut off.

<span id="an_88:6">88:6</span> Thou hast put me in the lowest pit, In
dark places, in depths.

<span id="an_88:7">88:7</span> Upon me hath Thy fury lain, And \[with\]
all Thy breakers Thou hast afflicted. Selah.

<span id="an_88:8">88:8</span> Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from
me, Thou hast made me an abomination to them, Shut up -- I go not forth.

<span id="an_88:9">88:9</span> Mine eye hath grieved because of
affliction, I called Thee, O Jehovah, all the day, I have spread out
unto Thee my hands.

<span id="an_88:10">88:10</span> To the dead dost Thou do wonders? Do
Rephaim rise? do they thank Thee? Selah.

<span id="an_88:11">88:11</span> Is Thy kindness recounted in the grave?
Thy faithfulness in destruction?

<span id="an_88:12">88:12</span> Are Thy wonders known in the darkness?
And Thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?

<span id="an_88:13">88:13</span> And I, unto Thee, O Jehovah, I have
cried, And in the morning doth my prayer come before Thee.

<span id="an_88:14">88:14</span> Why, O Jehovah, castest Thou off my
soul? Thou hidest Thy face from me.

<span id="an_88:15">88:15</span> I \[am\] afflicted, and expiring from
youth, I have borne Thy terrors -- I pine away.

<span id="an_88:16">88:16</span> Over me hath Thy wrath passed, Thy
terrors have cut me off,

<span id="an_88:17">88:17</span> They have surrounded me as waters all
the day, They have gone round against me together,

<span id="an_88:18">88:18</span> Thou hast put far from me lover and
friend, Mine acquaintance \[is\] the place of darkness!

<span id="an_89:1">89:1</span> An instruction, by Ethan the Ezrahite. Of
the kind acts of Jehovah, to the age I sing, To all generations I make
known Thy faithfulness with my mouth,

<span id="an_89:2">89:2</span> For I said, \`To the age is kindness
built, The heavens! Thou dost establish Thy faithfulness in them.'

<span id="an_89:3">89:3</span> I have made a covenant for My chosen, I
have sworn to David My servant:

<span id="an_89:4">89:4</span> \`Even to the age do I establish thy
seed, And have built to generation and generation thy throne. Selah.

<span id="an_89:5">89:5</span> and the heavens confess Thy wonders, O
Jehovah, Thy faithfulness also \[is\] in an assembly of holy ones.

<span id="an_89:6">89:6</span> For who in the sky, Compareth himself to
Jehovah? Is like to Jehovah among sons of the mighty?

<span id="an_89:7">89:7</span> God is very terrible, In the secret
counsel of His holy ones, And fearful over all surrounding Him.

<span id="an_89:8">89:8</span> O Jehovah, God of Hosts, Who \[is\] like
Thee -- a strong Jah? And Thy faithfulness \[is\] round about Thee.

<span id="an_89:9">89:9</span> Thou \[art\] ruler over the pride of the
sea, In the lifting up of its billows Thou dost restrain them.

<span id="an_89:10">89:10</span> Thou hast bruised Rahab, as one
wounded. With the arm of Thy strength Thou hast scattered Thine enemies.

<span id="an_89:11">89:11</span> Thine \[are\] the heavens -- the earth
also \[is\] Thine, The habitable world and its fulness, Thou hast
founded them.

<span id="an_89:12">89:12</span> North and south Thou hast appointed
them, Tabor and Hermon in Thy name do sing.

<span id="an_89:13">89:13</span> Thou hast an arm with might, Strong is
Thy hand -- high Thy right hand.

<span id="an_89:14">89:14</span> Righteousness and judgment \[Are\] the
fixed place of Thy throne, Kindness and truth go before Thy face.

<span id="an_89:15">89:15</span> O the happiness of the people knowing
the shout, O Jehovah, in the light of Thy face they walk habitually.

<span id="an_89:16">89:16</span> In Thy name they rejoice all the day,
And in Thy righteousness they are exalted,

<span id="an_89:17">89:17</span> For the beauty of their strength
\[art\] Thou, And in Thy good will is our horn exalted,

<span id="an_89:18">89:18</span> For of Jehovah \[is\] our shield, And
of the Holy One of Israel our king.

<span id="an_89:19">89:19</span> Then Thou hast spoken in vision, To Thy
saint, yea, Thou sayest, I have placed help upon a mighty one, Exalted a
chosen one out of the people,

<span id="an_89:20">89:20</span> I have found David My servant, With My
holy oil I have anointed him.

<span id="an_89:21">89:21</span> With whom My hand is established, My
arm also doth strengthen him.

<span id="an_89:22">89:22</span> An enemy exacteth not upon him, And a
son of perverseness afflicteth him not.

<span id="an_89:23">89:23</span> And I have beaten down before him his
adversaries, And those hating him I plague,

<span id="an_89:24">89:24</span> And My faithfulness and kindness
\[are\] with him, And in My name is his horn exalted.

<span id="an_89:25">89:25</span> And I have set on the sea his hand, And
on the rivers his right hand.

<span id="an_89:26">89:26</span> He proclaimeth me: \`Thou \[art\] my
Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation.'

<span id="an_89:27">89:27</span> I also first-born do appoint him,
Highest of the kings of the earth.

<span id="an_89:28">89:28</span> To the age I keep for him My kindness,
And My covenant \[is\] stedfast with him.

<span id="an_89:29">89:29</span> And I have set his seed for ever, And
his throne as the days of the heavens.

<span id="an_89:30">89:30</span> If his sons forsake My law, And in My
judgments do not walk;

<span id="an_89:31">89:31</span> If My statutes they pollute, And My
commands do not keep,

<span id="an_89:32">89:32</span> I have looked after with a rod their
transgression, And with strokes their iniquity,

<span id="an_89:33">89:33</span> And My kindness I break not from him,
Nor do I deal falsely in My faithfulness.

<span id="an_89:34">89:34</span> I profane not My covenant, And that
which is going forth from My lips I change not.

<span id="an_89:35">89:35</span> Once I have sworn by My holiness, I lie
not to David,

<span id="an_89:36">89:36</span> His seed is to the age, And his throne
\[is\] as the sun before Me,

<span id="an_89:37">89:37</span> As the moon it is established -- to the
age, And the witness in the sky is stedfast. Selah.

<span id="an_89:38">89:38</span> And Thou, Thou hast cast off, and dost
reject, Thou hast shown Thyself wroth With Thine anointed,

<span id="an_89:39">89:39</span> Hast rejected the covenant of Thy
servant, Thou hast polluted to the earth his crown,

<span id="an_89:40">89:40</span> Thou hast broken down all his hedges,
Thou hast made his fenced places a ruin.

<span id="an_89:41">89:41</span> Spoiled him have all passing by the
way, He hath been a reproach to his neighbours,

<span id="an_89:42">89:42</span> Thou hast exalted the right hand of his
adversaries, Thou hast caused all his enemies to rejoice.

<span id="an_89:43">89:43</span> Also -- Thou turnest back the sharpness
of his sword, And hast not established him in battle,

<span id="an_89:44">89:44</span> Hast caused \[him\] to cease from his
brightness, And his throne to the earth hast cast down.

<span id="an_89:45">89:45</span> Thou hast shortened the days of his
youth, Hast covered him over \[with\] shame. Selah.

<span id="an_89:46">89:46</span> Till when, O Jehovah, art Thou hidden?
For ever doth Thy fury burn as fire?

<span id="an_89:47">89:47</span> Remember, I pray Thee, what \[is\]
life-time? Wherefore in vain hast Thou created All the sons of men?

<span id="an_89:48">89:48</span> Who \[is\] the man that liveth, and
doth not see death? He delivereth his soul from the hand of Sheol.
Selah.

<span id="an_89:49">89:49</span> Where \[are\] Thy former kindnesses, O
Lord. Thou hast sworn to David in Thy faithfulness,

<span id="an_89:50">89:50</span> Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Thy
servants, I have borne in my bosom all the strivings of the peoples,

<span id="an_89:51">89:51</span> Wherewith Thine enemies reproached, O
Jehovah, Wherewith they have reproached The steps of Thine anointed.

<span id="an_89:52">89:52</span> Blessed \[is\] Jehovah to the age.
Amen, and amen!

<span id="an_90:1">90:1</span> A Prayer of Moses, the man of God. Lord,
a habitation Thou -- Thou hast been, To us -- in generation and
generation,

<span id="an_90:2">90:2</span> Before mountains were brought forth, And
Thou dost form the earth and the world, Even from age unto age Thou
\[art\] God.

<span id="an_90:3">90:3</span> Thou turnest man unto a bruised thing,
And sayest, Turn back, ye sons of men.

<span id="an_90:4">90:4</span> For a thousand years in Thine eyes
\[are\] as yesterday, For it passeth on, yea, a watch by night.

<span id="an_90:5">90:5</span> Thou hast inundated them, they are
asleep, In the morning as grass he changeth.

<span id="an_90:6">90:6</span> In the morning it flourisheth, and hath
changed, At evening it is cut down, and hath withered.

<span id="an_90:7">90:7</span> For we were consumed in Thine anger, And
in Thy fury we have been troubled.

<span id="an_90:8">90:8</span> Thou hast set our iniquities before Thee,
Our hidden things at the light of Thy face,

<span id="an_90:9">90:9</span> For all our days pined away in Thy wrath,
We consumed our years as a meditation.

<span id="an_90:10">90:10</span> Days of our years, in them \[are\]
seventy years, And if, by reason of might, eighty years, Yet \[is\]
their enlargement labour and vanity, For it hath been cut off hastily,
and we fly away.

<span id="an_90:11">90:11</span> Who knoweth the power of Thine anger?
And according to Thy fear -- Thy wrath?

<span id="an_90:12">90:12</span> To number our days aright let \[us\]
know, And we bring the heart to wisdom.

<span id="an_90:13">90:13</span> Turn back, O Jehovah, till when? And
repent concerning Thy servants.

<span id="an_90:14">90:14</span> Satisfy us at morn \[with\] Thy
kindness, And we sing and rejoice all our days.

<span id="an_90:15">90:15</span> Cause us to rejoice according to the
days Wherein Thou hast afflicted us, The years we have seen evil.

<span id="an_90:16">90:16</span> Let Thy work appear unto Thy servants,
And Thine honour on their sons.

<span id="an_90:17">90:17</span> And let the pleasantness of Jehovah our
God be upon us, And the work of our hands establish on us, Yea, the work
of our hands establish it!

<span id="an_91:1">91:1</span> He who is dwelling In the secret place of
the Most High, In the shade of the Mighty lodgeth habitually,

<span id="an_91:2">91:2</span> He is saying of Jehovah, \`My refuge, and
my bulwark, my God, I trust in Him,'

<span id="an_91:3">91:3</span> For He delivereth thee from the snare of
a fowler, From a calamitous pestilence.

<span id="an_91:4">91:4</span> With His pinion He covereth thee over,
And under His wings thou dost trust, A shield and buckler \[is\] His
truth.

<span id="an_91:5">91:5</span> Thou art not afraid of fear by night, Of
arrow that flieth by day,

<span id="an_91:6">91:6</span> Of pestilence in thick darkness that
walketh, Of destruction that destroyeth at noon,

<span id="an_91:7">91:7</span> There fall at thy side a thousand, And a
myriad at thy right hand, Unto thee it cometh not nigh.

<span id="an_91:8">91:8</span> But with thine eyes thou lookest, And the
reward of the wicked thou seest,

<span id="an_91:9">91:9</span> (For Thou, O Jehovah, \[art\] my refuge,)
The Most High thou madest thy habitation.

<span id="an_91:10">91:10</span> Evil happeneth not unto thee, And a
plague cometh not near thy tent,

<span id="an_91:11">91:11</span> For His messengers He chargeth for
thee, To keep thee in all thy ways,

<span id="an_91:12">91:12</span> On the hands they bear thee up, Lest
thou smite against a stone thy foot.

<span id="an_91:13">91:13</span> On lion and asp thou treadest, Thou
trampest young lion and dragon.

<span id="an_91:14">91:14</span> Because in Me he hath delighted, I also
deliver him -- I set him on high, Because he hath known My name.

<span id="an_91:15">91:15</span> He doth call Me, and I answer him, I
\[am\] with him in distress, I deliver him, and honour him.

<span id="an_91:16">91:16</span> With length of days I satisfy him, And
I cause him to look on My salvation!

<span id="an_92:1">92:1</span> A Psalm. -- A Song for the sabbath-day.
Good to give thanks to Jehovah, And to sing praises to Thy name, O Most
High,

<span id="an_92:2">92:2</span> To declare in the morning Thy kindness,
And Thy faithfulness in the nights.

<span id="an_92:3">92:3</span> On ten strings and on psaltery, On
higgaion, with harp.

<span id="an_92:4">92:4</span> For Thou hast caused me to rejoice, O
Jehovah, in Thy work, Concerning the works of Thy hands I sing.

<span id="an_92:5">92:5</span> How great have been Thy works, O Jehovah,
Very deep have been Thy thoughts.

<span id="an_92:6">92:6</span> A brutish man doth not know, And a fool
understandeth not this; --

<span id="an_92:7">92:7</span> When the wicked flourish as a herb, And
blossom do all workers of iniquity -- For their being destroyed for ever
and ever!

<span id="an_92:8">92:8</span> And Thou \[art\] high to the age, O
Jehovah.

<span id="an_92:9">92:9</span> For, lo, Thine enemies, O Jehovah, For,
lo, Thine enemies, do perish, Separate themselves do all workers of
iniquity.

<span id="an_92:10">92:10</span> And Thou exaltest as a reem my horn, I
have been anointed with fresh oil.

<span id="an_92:11">92:11</span> And mine eye looketh on mine enemies,
Of those rising up against me, The evil doers, do mine ears hear.

<span id="an_92:12">92:12</span> The righteous as a palm-tree
flourisheth, As a cedar in Lebanon he groweth.

<span id="an_92:13">92:13</span> Those planted in the house of Jehovah,
In the courts of our God do flourish.

<span id="an_92:14">92:14</span> Still they bring forth in old age, Fat
and flourishing are they,

<span id="an_92:15">92:15</span> To declare that upright \[is\] Jehovah
my rock, And there is no perverseness in Him!

<span id="an_93:1">93:1</span> Jehovah hath reigned, Excellency He hath
put on, Jehovah put on strength, He girded Himself, Also -- established
is the world, unmoved.

<span id="an_93:2">93:2</span> Established is Thy throne since then,
From the age Thou \[art\].

<span id="an_93:3">93:3</span> Floods have lifted up, O Jehovah, Floods
have lifted up their voice, Floods lift up their breakers.

<span id="an_93:4">93:4</span> Than the voices of many mighty waters,
Breakers of a sea, mighty on high \[is\] Jehovah,

<span id="an_93:5">93:5</span> Thy testimonies have been very stedfast,
To Thy house comely \[is\] holiness, O Jehovah, for length of days!

<span id="an_94:1">94:1</span> God of vengeance -- Jehovah! God of
vengeance, shine forth.

<span id="an_94:2">94:2</span> Be lifted up, O Judge of the earth, Send
back a recompence on the proud.

<span id="an_94:3">94:3</span> Till when \[do\] the wicked, O Jehovah?
Till when do the wicked exult?

<span id="an_94:4">94:4</span> They utter -- they speak an old saw, All
working iniquity do boast themselves.

<span id="an_94:5">94:5</span> Thy people, O Jehovah, they bruise, And
Thine inheritance they afflict.

<span id="an_94:6">94:6</span> Widow and sojourner they slay, And
fatherless ones they murder.

<span id="an_94:7">94:7</span> And they say, \`Jehovah doth not see, And
the God of Jacob doth not consider.'

<span id="an_94:8">94:8</span> Consider, ye brutish among the people,
And ye foolish, when do ye act wisely?

<span id="an_94:9">94:9</span> He who planteth the ear doth He not hear?
He who formeth the eye doth He not see?

<span id="an_94:10">94:10</span> He who is instructing nations, Doth He
not reprove? He who is teaching man knowledge \[is\] Jehovah.

<span id="an_94:11">94:11</span> He knoweth the thoughts of man, that
they \[are\] vanity.

<span id="an_94:12">94:12</span> O the happiness of the man Whom Thou
instructest, O Jah, And out of Thy law teachest him,

<span id="an_94:13">94:13</span> To give rest to him from days of evil,
While a pit is digged for the wicked.

<span id="an_94:14">94:14</span> For Jehovah leaveth not His people, And
His inheritance forsaketh not.

<span id="an_94:15">94:15</span> For to righteousness judgment turneth
back, And after it all the upright of heart,

<span id="an_94:16">94:16</span> Who riseth up for me with evil doers?
Who stationeth himself for me with workers of iniquity?

<span id="an_94:17">94:17</span> Unless Jehovah \[were\] a help to me,
My soul had almost inhabited silence.

<span id="an_94:18">94:18</span> If I have said, \`My foot hath
slipped,' Thy kindness, O Jehovah, supporteth me.

<span id="an_94:19">94:19</span> In the abundance of my thoughts within
me, Thy comforts delight my soul.

<span id="an_94:20">94:20</span> Is a throne of mischief joined \[with\]
Thee? A framer of perverseness by statute?

<span id="an_94:21">94:21</span> They decree against the soul of the
righteous, And innocent blood declare wicked.

<span id="an_94:22">94:22</span> And Jehovah is for a high place to me,
And my God \[is\] for a rock -- my refuge,

<span id="an_94:23">94:23</span> And turneth back on them their
iniquity, And in their wickedness cutteth them off; Jehovah our God doth
cut them off!

<span id="an_95:1">95:1</span> Come, we sing to Jehovah, We shout to the
rock of our salvation.

<span id="an_95:2">95:2</span> We come before His face with
thanksgiving, With psalms we shout to Him.

<span id="an_95:3">95:3</span> For a great God \[is\] Jehovah, And a
great king over all gods.

<span id="an_95:4">95:4</span> In whose hand \[are\] the deep places of
earth, And the strong places of hills \[are\] His.

<span id="an_95:5">95:5</span> Whose is the sea, and He made it, And His
hands formed the dry land.

<span id="an_95:6">95:6</span> Come in, we bow ourselves, and we bend,
We kneel before Jehovah our Maker.

<span id="an_95:7">95:7</span> For He \[is\] our God, and we the people
of His pasture, And the flock of His hand, To-day, if to His voice ye
hearken,

<span id="an_95:8">95:8</span> Harden not your heart as \[in\] Meribah,
As \[in\] the day of Massah in the wilderness,

<span id="an_95:9">95:9</span> Where your fathers have tried Me, Have
proved Me, yea, have seen My work.

<span id="an_95:10">95:10</span> Forty years I am weary of the
generation, And I say, \`A people erring in heart -- they! And they have
not known My ways:'

<span id="an_95:11">95:11</span> Where I sware in Mine anger, \`If they
come in unto My rest -- !'

<span id="an_96:1">96:1</span> Sing to Jehovah a new song, Sing to
Jehovah all the earth.

<span id="an_96:2">96:2</span> Sing to Jehovah, bless His name, Proclaim
from day to day His salvation.

<span id="an_96:3">96:3</span> Declare among nations His honour, Among
all the peoples His wonders.

<span id="an_96:4">96:4</span> For great \[is\] Jehovah, and praised
greatly, Fearful He \[is\] over all gods.

<span id="an_96:5">96:5</span> For all the gods of the peoples \[are\]
nought, And Jehovah made the heavens.

<span id="an_96:6">96:6</span> Honour and majesty \[are\] before Him,
Strength and beauty in His sanctuary.

<span id="an_96:7">96:7</span> Ascribe to Jehovah, O families of the
peoples, Ascribe to Jehovah honour and strength.

<span id="an_96:8">96:8</span> Ascribe to Jehovah the honour of His
name, Lift up a present and come in to His courts.

<span id="an_96:9">96:9</span> Bow yourselves to Jehovah, In the honour
of holiness, Be afraid of His presence, all the earth.

<span id="an_96:10">96:10</span> Say among nations, \`Jehovah hath
reigned, Also -- established is the world, unmoved, He judgeth the
peoples in uprightness.'

<span id="an_96:11">96:11</span> The heavens joy, and the earth is
joyful, The sea and its fulness roar.

<span id="an_96:12">96:12</span> The field exulteth, and all that \[is\]
in it, Then sing do all trees of the forest,

<span id="an_96:13">96:13</span> Before Jehovah, for He hath come, For
He hath come to judge the earth. He judgeth the world in righteousness,
And the peoples in His faithfulness!

<span id="an_97:1">97:1</span> Jehovah hath reigned, The earth is
joyful, many isles rejoice.

<span id="an_97:2">97:2</span> Cloud and darkness \[are\] round about
Him, Righteousness and judgment the basis of His throne.

<span id="an_97:3">97:3</span> Fire before Him goeth, And burneth round
about His adversaries.

<span id="an_97:4">97:4</span> Lightened have His lightnings the world,
The earth hath seen, and is pained.

<span id="an_97:5">97:5</span> Hills, like wax, melted before Jehovah,
Before the Lord of all the earth.

<span id="an_97:6">97:6</span> The heavens declared His righteousness,
And all the peoples have seen His honour.

<span id="an_97:7">97:7</span> Ashamed are all servants of a graven
image, Those boasting themselves in idols, Bow yourselves to him, all ye
gods.

<span id="an_97:8">97:8</span> Zion hath heard and rejoiceth, And
daughters of Judah are joyful, Because of Thy judgments, O Jehovah.

<span id="an_97:9">97:9</span> For Thou, Jehovah, \[art\] Most High over
all the earth, Greatly Thou hast been exalted over all gods.

<span id="an_97:10">97:10</span> Ye who love Jehovah, hate evil, He is
keeping the souls of His saints, From the hand of the wicked he
delivereth them.

<span id="an_97:11">97:11</span> Light \[is\] sown for the righteous,
And for the upright of heart -- joy.

<span id="an_97:12">97:12</span> Rejoice, ye righteous, in Jehovah, And
give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness!

<span id="an_98:1">98:1</span> A Psalm. Sing ye to Jehovah a new song,
For wonders He hath done, Given salvation to Him hath His right hand and
His holy arm.

<span id="an_98:2">98:2</span> Jehovah hath made known His salvation,
Before the eyes of the nations, He hath revealed His righteousness,

<span id="an_98:3">98:3</span> He hath remembered His kindness, And His
faithfulness to the house of Israel, All ends of earth have seen the
salvation of our God.

<span id="an_98:4">98:4</span> Shout to Jehovah, all the earth, Break
forth, and cry aloud, and sing.

<span id="an_98:5">98:5</span> Sing to Jehovah with harp, With harp, and
voice of praise,

<span id="an_98:6">98:6</span> With trumpets, and voice of a cornet,
Shout ye before the king Jehovah.

<span id="an_98:7">98:7</span> Roar doth the sea and its fulness, The
world and the inhabitants in it.

<span id="an_98:8">98:8</span> Floods clap hand, together hills cry
aloud,

<span id="an_98:9">98:9</span> Before Jehovah, For He hath come to judge
the earth, He judgeth the world in righteousness, And the people in
uprightness!

<span id="an_99:1">99:1</span> Jehovah hath reigned, peoples tremble,
The Inhabitant of the cherubs, the earth shaketh.

<span id="an_99:2">99:2</span> Jehovah in Zion \[is\] great, And high He
\[is\] over all the peoples.

<span id="an_99:3">99:3</span> They praise Thy name, \`Great, and
fearful, holy \[it\] is.'

<span id="an_99:4">99:4</span> And the strength of the king Hath loved
judgment, Thou -- Thou hast established uprightness; Judgment and
righteousness in Jacob, Thou -- Thou hast done.

<span id="an_99:5">99:5</span> Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And bow
yourselves at His footstool, holy \[is\] He.

<span id="an_99:6">99:6</span> Moses and Aaron among His priests, And
Samuel among those proclaiming His name. They are calling unto Jehovah,
And He doth answer them.

<span id="an_99:7">99:7</span> In a pillar of cloud He speaketh unto
them, They have kept His testimonies, And the statute He hath given to
them.

<span id="an_99:8">99:8</span> O Jehovah, our God, Thou hast afflicted
them, A God forgiving Thou hast been to them, And taking vengeance on
their actions.

<span id="an_99:9">99:9</span> Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And bow
yourselves at His holy hill, For holy \[is\] Jehovah our God!

<span id="an_100:1">100:1</span> A Psalm of Thanksgiving. Shout to
Jehovah, all the earth.

<span id="an_100:2">100:2</span> Serve Jehovah with joy, come before him
with singing.

<span id="an_100:3">100:3</span> Know that Jehovah He \[is\] God, He
made us, and we are His, His people -- and the flock of His pasture.

<span id="an_100:4">100:4</span> Enter ye His gates with thanksgiving,
His courts with praise, Give ye thanks to Him, bless ye His Name.

<span id="an_100:5">100:5</span> For good \[is\] Jehovah, to the age His
kindness, And to generation and generation His faithfulness!

<span id="an_101:1">101:1</span> A Psalm of David. Kindness and judgment
I sing, To Thee, O Jehovah, I sing praise.

<span id="an_101:2">101:2</span> I act wisely in a perfect way, When
dost Thou come in unto me? I walk habitually in the integrity of my
heart, In the midst of my house.

<span id="an_101:3">101:3</span> I set not before mine eyes a worthless
thing, The work of those turning aside I have hated, It adhereth not to
me.

<span id="an_101:4">101:4</span> A perverse heart turneth aside from me,
Wickedness I know not.

<span id="an_101:5">101:5</span> Whoso slandereth in secret his
neighbour, Him I cut off, The high of eyes and proud of heart, him I
endure not.

<span id="an_101:6">101:6</span> Mine eyes are on the faithful of the
land, To dwell with me, Whoso is walking in a perfect way, he serveth
me.

<span id="an_101:7">101:7</span> He dwelleth not in my house who is
working deceit, Whoso is speaking lies Is not established before mine
eyes.

<span id="an_101:8">101:8</span> At morning I cut off all the wicked of
the land, To cut off from the city of Jehovah All the workers of
iniquity!

<span id="an_102:1">102:1</span> A Prayer of the afflicted when he is
feeble, and before Jehovah poureth out his plaint. O Jehovah, hear my
prayer, yea, my cry to Thee cometh.

<span id="an_102:2">102:2</span> Hide not Thou Thy face from me, In a
day of mine adversity, Incline unto me Thine ear, In the day I call,
haste, answer me.

<span id="an_102:3">102:3</span> For consumed in smoke have been my
days, And my bones as a fire-brand have burned.

<span id="an_102:4">102:4</span> Smitten as the herb, and withered, is
my heart, For I have forgotten to eat my bread.

<span id="an_102:5">102:5</span> From the voice of my sighing Hath my
bone cleaved to my flesh.

<span id="an_102:6">102:6</span> I have been like to a pelican of the
wilderness, I have been as an owl of the dry places.

<span id="an_102:7">102:7</span> I have watched, and I am As a bird
alone on the roof.

<span id="an_102:8">102:8</span> All the day mine enemies reproached me,
Those mad at me have sworn against me.

<span id="an_102:9">102:9</span> Because ashes as bread I have eaten,
And my drink with weeping have mingled,

<span id="an_102:10">102:10</span> From Thine indignation and Thy wrath,
For Thou hast lifted me up, And dost cast me down.

<span id="an_102:11">102:11</span> My days as a shadow \[are\] stretched
out, And I -- as the herb I am withered.

<span id="an_102:12">102:12</span> And Thou, O Jehovah, to the age
abidest, And Thy memorial to all generations.

<span id="an_102:13">102:13</span> Thou -- Thou risest -- Thou pitiest
Zion, For the time to favour her, For the appointed time hath come.

<span id="an_102:14">102:14</span> For Thy servants have been pleased
with her stones, And her dust they favour.

<span id="an_102:15">102:15</span> And nations fear the name of Jehovah,
And all kings of the earth Thine honour,

<span id="an_102:16">102:16</span> For Jehovah hath builded Zion, He
hath been seen in His honour,

<span id="an_102:17">102:17</span> He turned unto the prayer of the
destitute, And He hath not despised their prayer.

<span id="an_102:18">102:18</span> This is written for a later
generation, And the people created do praise Jah.

<span id="an_102:19">102:19</span> For He hath looked From the high
place of His sanctuary. Jehovah from heaven unto earth looked
attentively,

<span id="an_102:20">102:20</span> To hear the groan of the prisoner, To
loose sons of death,

<span id="an_102:21">102:21</span> To declare in Zion the name of
Jehovah, And His praise in Jerusalem,

<span id="an_102:22">102:22</span> In the peoples being gathered
together, And the kingdoms -- to serve Jehovah.

<span id="an_102:23">102:23</span> He hath humbled in the way my power,
He hath shortened my days.

<span id="an_102:24">102:24</span> I say, \`My God, take me not up in
the midst of my days,' Through all generations \[are\] Thine years.

<span id="an_102:25">102:25</span> Beforetime the earth Thou didst
found, And the work of Thy hands \[are\] the heavens.

<span id="an_102:26">102:26</span> They -- They perish, and Thou
remainest, And all of them as a garment become old, As clothing Thou
changest them, And they are changed.

<span id="an_102:27">102:27</span> And Thou \[art\] the same, and Thine
years are not finished.

<span id="an_102:28">102:28</span> The sons of Thy servants do continue,
And their seed before Thee is established!

<span id="an_103:1">103:1</span> By David. Bless, O my soul, Jehovah,
And all my inward parts -- His Holy Name.

<span id="an_103:2">103:2</span> Bless, O my soul, Jehovah, And forget
not all His benefits,

<span id="an_103:3">103:3</span> Who is forgiving all thine iniquities,
Who is healing all thy diseases,

<span id="an_103:4">103:4</span> Who is redeeming from destruction thy
life, Who is crowning thee -- kindness and mercies,

<span id="an_103:5">103:5</span> Who is satisfying with good thy desire,
Renew itself as an eagle doth thy youth.

<span id="an_103:6">103:6</span> Jehovah is doing righteousness and
judgments For all the oppressed.

<span id="an_103:7">103:7</span> He maketh known His ways to Moses, To
the sons of Israel His acts.

<span id="an_103:8">103:8</span> Merciful and gracious \[is\] Jehovah,
Slow to anger, and abundant in mercy.

<span id="an_103:9">103:9</span> Not for ever doth He strive, Nor to the
age doth He watch.

<span id="an_103:10">103:10</span> Not according to our sins hath He
done to us, Nor according to our iniquities Hath He conferred benefits
upon us.

<span id="an_103:11">103:11</span> For, as the height of the heavens
\[is\] above the earth, His kindness hath been mighty over those fearing
Him.

<span id="an_103:12">103:12</span> As the distance of east from west He
hath put far from us our transgressions.

<span id="an_103:13">103:13</span> As a father hath mercy on sons,
Jehovah hath mercy on those fearing Him.

<span id="an_103:14">103:14</span> For He hath known our frame,
Remembering that we \[are\] dust.

<span id="an_103:15">103:15</span> Mortal man! as grass \[are\] his
days, As a flower of the field so he flourisheth;

<span id="an_103:16">103:16</span> For a wind hath passed over it, and
it is not, And its place doth not discern it any more.

<span id="an_103:17">103:17</span> And the kindness of Jehovah \[Is\]
from age even unto age on those fearing Him, And His righteousness to
sons' sons,

<span id="an_103:18">103:18</span> To those keeping His covenant, And to
those remembering His precepts to do them.

<span id="an_103:19">103:19</span> Jehovah in the heavens Hath
established His throne, And His kingdom over all hath ruled.

<span id="an_103:20">103:20</span> Bless Jehovah, ye His messengers,
Mighty in power -- doing His word, To hearken to the voice of His Word.

<span id="an_103:21">103:21</span> Bless Jehovah, all ye His hosts, His
ministers -- doing His pleasure.

<span id="an_103:22">103:22</span> Bless Jehovah, all ye His works, In
all places of His dominion. Bless, O my soul, Jehovah!

<span id="an_104:1">104:1</span> Bless, O my soul, Jehovah! Jehovah, my
God, Thou hast been very great, Honour and majesty Thou hast put on.

<span id="an_104:2">104:2</span> Covering himself \[with\] light as a
garment, Stretching out the heavens as a curtain,

<span id="an_104:3">104:3</span> Who is laying the beam of His upper
chambers in the waters, Who is making thick clouds His chariot, Who is
walking on wings of wind,

<span id="an_104:4">104:4</span> Making His messengers -- the winds, His
ministers -- the flaming fire.

<span id="an_104:5">104:5</span> He hath founded earth on its bases, It
is not moved to the age and for ever.

<span id="an_104:6">104:6</span> The abyss! as with clothing Thou hast
covered it, Above hills do waters stand.

<span id="an_104:7">104:7</span> From Thy rebuke they flee, From the
voice of Thy thunder haste away.

<span id="an_104:8">104:8</span> They go up hills -- they go down
valleys, Unto a place Thou hast founded for them.

<span id="an_104:9">104:9</span> A border Thou hast set, they pass not
over, They turn not back to cover the earth.

<span id="an_104:10">104:10</span> Who is sending forth fountains in
valleys, Between hills they go on.

<span id="an_104:11">104:11</span> They water every beast of the field,
Wild asses break their thirst.

<span id="an_104:12">104:12</span> By them the fowl of the heavens doth
dwell, From between the branches They give forth the voice.

<span id="an_104:13">104:13</span> Watering hills from His upper
chambers, From the fruit of Thy works is the earth satisfied.

<span id="an_104:14">104:14</span> Causing grass to spring up for
cattle, And herb for the service of man, To bring forth bread from the
earth,

<span id="an_104:15">104:15</span> And wine -- it rejoiceth the heart of
man, To cause the face to shine from oil, And bread -- the heart of man
it supporteth.

<span id="an_104:16">104:16</span> Satisfied \[are\] the trees of
Jehovah, Cedars of Lebanon that He hath planted,

<span id="an_104:17">104:17</span> Where birds do make nests, The stork
-- the firs \[are\] her house.

<span id="an_104:18">104:18</span> The high hills \[are\] for wild
goats, Rocks \[are\] a refuge for conies,

<span id="an_104:19">104:19</span> He made the moon for seasons, The sun
hath known his place of entrance.

<span id="an_104:20">104:20</span> Thou settest darkness, and it is
night, In it doth every beast of the forest creep.

<span id="an_104:21">104:21</span> The young lions are roaring for prey,
And to seek from God their food.

<span id="an_104:22">104:22</span> The sun riseth, they are gathered,
And in their dens they crouch.

<span id="an_104:23">104:23</span> Man goeth forth to his work, And to
his service -- till evening.

<span id="an_104:24">104:24</span> How many have been Thy works, O
Jehovah, All of them in wisdom Thou hast made, Full is the earth of thy
possessions.

<span id="an_104:25">104:25</span> This, the sea, great and broad of
sides, There \[are\] moving things -- innumerable, Living creatures --
small with great.

<span id="an_104:26">104:26</span> There do ships go: leviathan, That
Thou hast formed to play in it.

<span id="an_104:27">104:27</span> All of them unto Thee do look, To
give their food in its season.

<span id="an_104:28">104:28</span> Thou dost give to them -- they
gather, Thou dost open Thy hand -- they \[are\] satisfied \[with\] good.

<span id="an_104:29">104:29</span> Thou hidest Thy face -- they are
troubled, Thou gatherest their spirit -- they expire, And unto their
dust they turn back.

<span id="an_104:30">104:30</span> Thou sendest out Thy Spirit, they are
created, And Thou renewest the face of the ground.

<span id="an_104:31">104:31</span> The honour of Jehovah is to the age,
Jehovah rejoiceth in His works,

<span id="an_104:32">104:32</span> Who is looking to earth, and it
trembleth, He cometh against hills, and they smoke.

<span id="an_104:33">104:33</span> I sing to Jehovah during my life, I
sing praise to my God while I exist.

<span id="an_104:34">104:34</span> Sweet is my meditation on Him, I -- I
do rejoice in Jehovah.

<span id="an_104:35">104:35</span> Consumed are sinners from the earth,
And the wicked are no more. Bless, O my soul, Jehovah. Praise ye
Jehovah!

<span id="an_105:1">105:1</span> Give ye thanks to Jehovah -- call ye in
His name, Make known among the peoples His acts.

<span id="an_105:2">105:2</span> Sing ye to Him -- sing praise to Him,
Meditate ye on all His wonders.

<span id="an_105:3">105:3</span> Boast yourselves in His Holy Name, The
heart of those seeking Jehovah rejoiceth.

<span id="an_105:4">105:4</span> Seek ye Jehovah and His strength, Seek
ye His face continually.

<span id="an_105:5">105:5</span> Remember His wonders that He did, His
signs and the judgments of His mouth.

<span id="an_105:6">105:6</span> O seed of Abraham, His servant, O sons
of Jacob, His chosen ones.

<span id="an_105:7">105:7</span> He \[is\] Jehovah our God, In all the
earth \[are\] His judgments.

<span id="an_105:8">105:8</span> He hath remembered to the age His
covenant, The word He commanded to a thousand generations,

<span id="an_105:9">105:9</span> That He hath made with Abraham, And His
oath to Isaac,

<span id="an_105:10">105:10</span> And doth establish it to Jacob for a
statute, To Israel -- a covenant age-during,

<span id="an_105:11">105:11</span> Saying, \`To thee I give the land of
Canaan, The portion of your inheritance,'

<span id="an_105:12">105:12</span> In their being few in number, But a
few, and sojourners in it.

<span id="an_105:13">105:13</span> And they go up and down, from nation
unto nation, From a kingdom unto another people.

<span id="an_105:14">105:14</span> He hath not suffered any to oppress
them And He reproveth for their sakes kings.

<span id="an_105:15">105:15</span> \`Strike not against Mine anointed,
And to My prophets do not evil.'

<span id="an_105:16">105:16</span> And He calleth a famine on the land,
The whole staff of bread He hath broken.

<span id="an_105:17">105:17</span> He hath sent before them a man, For a
servant hath Joseph been sold.

<span id="an_105:18">105:18</span> They have afflicted with fetters his
feet, Iron hath entered his soul,

<span id="an_105:19">105:19</span> Till the time of the coming of His
word The saying of Jehovah hath tried him.

<span id="an_105:20">105:20</span> The king hath sent, and looseth him,
The ruler of the peoples, and draweth him out.

<span id="an_105:21">105:21</span> He hath made him lord of his house,
And ruler over all his possessions.

<span id="an_105:22">105:22</span> To bind his chiefs at his pleasure,
And his elders he maketh wise.

<span id="an_105:23">105:23</span> And Israel cometh in to Egypt, And
Jacob hath sojourned in the land of Ham.

<span id="an_105:24">105:24</span> And He maketh His people very
fruitful, And maketh it mightier than its adversaries.

<span id="an_105:25">105:25</span> He turned their heart to hate His
people, To conspire against His servants.

<span id="an_105:26">105:26</span> He hath sent Moses His servant, Aaron
whom He had fixed on.

<span id="an_105:27">105:27</span> They have set among them the matters
of His signs, And wonders in the land of Ham.

<span id="an_105:28">105:28</span> He hath sent darkness, and it is
dark, And they have not provoked His word.

<span id="an_105:29">105:29</span> He hath turned their waters to blood,
And putteth to death their fish.

<span id="an_105:30">105:30</span> Teemed hath their land \[with\]
frogs, In the inner chambers of their kings.

<span id="an_105:31">105:31</span> He hath said, and the beetle cometh,
Lice into all their border.

<span id="an_105:32">105:32</span> He hath made their showers hail, A
flaming fire \[is\] in their land.

<span id="an_105:33">105:33</span> And He smiteth their vine and their
fig, And shivereth the trees of their border.

<span id="an_105:34">105:34</span> He hath said, and the locust cometh,
And the cankerworm -- innumerable,

<span id="an_105:35">105:35</span> And it consumeth every herb in their
land, And it consumeth the fruit of their ground.

<span id="an_105:36">105:36</span> And He smiteth every first-born in
their land, The first-fruit of all their strength,

<span id="an_105:37">105:37</span> And bringeth them out with silver and
gold, And there is not in its tribes a feeble one.

<span id="an_105:38">105:38</span> Rejoiced hath Egypt in their going
forth, For their fear had fallen upon them.

<span id="an_105:39">105:39</span> He hath spread a cloud for a
covering, And fire to enlighten the night.

<span id="an_105:40">105:40</span> They have asked, and He bringeth
quails, And \[with\] bread of heaven satisfieth them.

<span id="an_105:41">105:41</span> He hath opened a rock, and waters
issue, They have gone on in dry places -- a river.

<span id="an_105:42">105:42</span> For He hath remembered His holy word,
With Abraham His servant,

<span id="an_105:43">105:43</span> And He bringeth forth His people with
joy, With singing His chosen ones.

<span id="an_105:44">105:44</span> And He giveth to them the lands of
nations, And the labour of peoples they possess,

<span id="an_105:45">105:45</span> That they may observe His statutes,
And His laws may keep. Praise ye Jehovah!

<span id="an_106:1">106:1</span> Praise ye Jah, give thanks to Jehovah,
For good, for to the age, \[is\] His kindness.

<span id="an_106:2">106:2</span> Who doth utter the mighty acts of
Jehovah? Soundeth all His praise?

<span id="an_106:3">106:3</span> O the happiness of those keeping
judgment, Doing righteousness at all times.

<span id="an_106:4">106:4</span> Remember me, O Jehovah, With the favour
of Thy people, Look after me in Thy salvation.

<span id="an_106:5">106:5</span> To look on the good of Thy chosen ones,
To rejoice in the joy of Thy nation, To boast myself with Thine
inheritance.

<span id="an_106:6">106:6</span> We have sinned with our fathers, We
have done perversely, we have done wickedly.

<span id="an_106:7">106:7</span> Our fathers in Egypt, Have not
considered wisely Thy wonders, They have not remembered The abundance of
Thy kind acts, And provoke by the sea, at the sea of Suph.

<span id="an_106:8">106:8</span> And He saveth them for His name's sake,
To make known His might,

<span id="an_106:9">106:9</span> And rebuketh the sea of Suph, and it is
dried up, And causeth them to go Through depths as a wilderness.

<span id="an_106:10">106:10</span> And He saveth them from the hand Of
him who is hating, And redeemeth them from the hand of the enemy.

<span id="an_106:11">106:11</span> And waters cover their adversaries,
One of them hath not been left.

<span id="an_106:12">106:12</span> And they believe in His words, they
sing His praise,

<span id="an_106:13">106:13</span> They have hasted -- forgotten His
works, They have not waited for His counsel.

<span id="an_106:14">106:14</span> And they lust greatly in a
wilderness, And try God in a desert.

<span id="an_106:15">106:15</span> And He giveth to them their request,
And sendeth leanness into their soul.

<span id="an_106:16">106:16</span> And they are envious of Moses in the
camp, Of Aaron, Jehovah's holy one.

<span id="an_106:17">106:17</span> Earth openeth, and swalloweth up
Dathan, And covereth over the company of Abiram.

<span id="an_106:18">106:18</span> And fire burneth among their company,
A flame setteth on fire the wicked.

<span id="an_106:19">106:19</span> They make a calf in Horeb, And bow
themselves to a molten image,

<span id="an_106:20">106:20</span> And change their Honour Into the form
of an ox eating herbs.

<span id="an_106:21">106:21</span> They have forgotten God their
saviour, The doer of great things in Egypt,

<span id="an_106:22">106:22</span> Of wonderful things in the land of
Ham, Of fearful things by the sea of Suph.

<span id="an_106:23">106:23</span> And He saith to destroy them, Unless
Moses, His chosen one, Had stood in the breach before Him, To turn back
His wrath from destroying.

<span id="an_106:24">106:24</span> And they kick against the desirable
land, They have not given credence to His word.

<span id="an_106:25">106:25</span> And they murmur in their tents, They
have not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah.

<span id="an_106:26">106:26</span> And He lifteth up His hand to them,
To cause them to fall in a wilderness,

<span id="an_106:27">106:27</span> And to cause their seed to fall among
nations, And to scatter them through lands.

<span id="an_106:28">106:28</span> And they are coupled to Baal-Peor,
And eat the sacrifices of the dead,

<span id="an_106:29">106:29</span> And they provoke to anger by their
actions, And a plague breaketh forth upon them,

<span id="an_106:30">106:30</span> And Phinehas standeth, and executeth
judgment, And the plague is restrained,

<span id="an_106:31">106:31</span> And it is reckoned to him to
righteousness, To all generations -- unto the age.

<span id="an_106:32">106:32</span> And they cause wrath by the waters of
Meribah, And it is evil to Moses for their sakes,

<span id="an_106:33">106:33</span> For they have provoked his spirit,
And he speaketh wrongfully with his lips.

<span id="an_106:34">106:34</span> They have not destroyed the peoples,
As Jehovah had said to them,

<span id="an_106:35">106:35</span> And mix themselves among nations, and
learn their works,

<span id="an_106:36">106:36</span> And serve their idols, And they are
to them for a snare.

<span id="an_106:37">106:37</span> And they sacrifice their sons And
their daughters to destroyers,

<span id="an_106:38">106:38</span> And they shed innocent blood -- Blood
of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they have sacrificed to idols
of Canaan, And the land is profaned with blood.

<span id="an_106:39">106:39</span> And they are defiled with their
works, And commit whoredom in their habitual doings.

<span id="an_106:40">106:40</span> And the anger of Jehovah Is kindled
against His people, And He doth abominate His inheritance.

<span id="an_106:41">106:41</span> And giveth them into the hand of
nations, And those hating them rule over them,

<span id="an_106:42">106:42</span> And their enemies oppress them, And
they are humbled under their hand.

<span id="an_106:43">106:43</span> Many times He doth deliver them, And
they rebel in their counsel, And they are brought low in their iniquity.

<span id="an_106:44">106:44</span> And He looketh on their distress When
He heareth their cry,

<span id="an_106:45">106:45</span> And remembereth for them His
covenant, And is comforted, According to the abundance of His kindness.

<span id="an_106:46">106:46</span> And He appointeth them for mercies
Before all their captors.

<span id="an_106:47">106:47</span> Save us, O Jehovah our God, and
gather us from the nations, To give thanks to Thy holy name, To glory in
Thy praise.

<span id="an_106:48">106:48</span> Blessed \[is\] Jehovah, God of
Israel, From the age even unto the age. And all the people said, \`Amen,
praise Jah!'

<span id="an_107:1">107:1</span> \`Give ye thanks to Jehovah, For good,
for to the age \[is\] His kindness:'

<span id="an_107:2">107:2</span> Let the redeemed of Jehovah say, Whom
He redeemed from the hand of an adversary.

<span id="an_107:3">107:3</span> And from the lands hath gathered them,
From east and from west, From north, and from the sea.

<span id="an_107:4">107:4</span> They wandered in a wilderness, in a
desert by the way, A city of habitation they have not found.

<span id="an_107:5">107:5</span> Hungry -- yea -- thirsty, Their soul in
them becometh feeble,

<span id="an_107:6">107:6</span> And they cry unto Jehovah in their
adversity, From their distress He delivereth them,

<span id="an_107:7">107:7</span> And causeth them to tread in a right
way, To go unto a city of habitation.

<span id="an_107:8">107:8</span> They confess to Jehovah His kindness,
And His wonders to the sons of men.

<span id="an_107:9">107:9</span> For He hath satisfied a longing soul,
And a hungry soul hath filled \[with\] goodness.

<span id="an_107:10">107:10</span> Inhabitants of dark places and
death-shade, Prisoners of affliction and of iron,

<span id="an_107:11">107:11</span> Because they changed the saying of
God, And the counsel of the Most High despised.

<span id="an_107:12">107:12</span> And He humbleth with labour their
heart, They have been feeble, and there is no helper.

<span id="an_107:13">107:13</span> And they cry unto Jehovah in their
adversity, From their distresses He saveth them.

<span id="an_107:14">107:14</span> He bringeth them out from the dark
place, And death-shade, And their bands He draweth away.

<span id="an_107:15">107:15</span> They confess to Jehovah His kindness,
And His wonders to the sons of men.

<span id="an_107:16">107:16</span> For He hath broken doors of brass,
And bars of iron He hath cut.

<span id="an_107:17">107:17</span> Fools, by means of their
transgression, And by their iniquities, afflict themselves.

<span id="an_107:18">107:18</span> All food doth their soul abominate,
And they come nigh unto the gates of death,

<span id="an_107:19">107:19</span> And cry unto Jehovah in their
adversity, From their distresses He saveth them,

<span id="an_107:20">107:20</span> He sendeth His word and healeth them,
And delivereth from their destructions.

<span id="an_107:21">107:21</span> They confess to Jehovah His kindness,
And His wonders to the sons of men,

<span id="an_107:22">107:22</span> And they sacrifice sacrifices of
thanksgiving, And recount His works with singing.

<span id="an_107:23">107:23</span> Those going down \[to\] the sea in
ships, Doing business in many waters,

<span id="an_107:24">107:24</span> They have seen the works of Jehovah,
And His wonders in the deep.

<span id="an_107:25">107:25</span> And He saith, and appointeth a
tempest, And it lifteth up its billows,

<span id="an_107:26">107:26</span> They go up \[to\] the heavens, they
go down \[to\] the depths, Their soul in evil is melted.

<span id="an_107:27">107:27</span> They reel to and fro, and move as a
drunkard, And all their wisdom is swallowed up.

<span id="an_107:28">107:28</span> And they cry to Jehovah in their
adversity, And from their distresses He bringeth them out.

<span id="an_107:29">107:29</span> He establisheth a whirlwind to a
calm, And hushed are their billows.

<span id="an_107:30">107:30</span> And they rejoice because they are
quiet, And He leadeth them to the haven of their desire.

<span id="an_107:31">107:31</span> They confess to Jehovah His kindness,
And His wonders to the sons of men,

<span id="an_107:32">107:32</span> And they exalt Him in the assembly of
the people, And in the seat of the elders praise Him.

<span id="an_107:33">107:33</span> He maketh rivers become a wilderness,
And fountains of waters become dry land.

<span id="an_107:34">107:34</span> A fruitful land becometh a barren
place, For the wickedness of its inhabitants.

<span id="an_107:35">107:35</span> He maketh a wilderness become a pool
of water, And a dry land become fountains of waters.

<span id="an_107:36">107:36</span> And He causeth the hungry to dwell
there, And they prepare a city of habitation.

<span id="an_107:37">107:37</span> And they sow fields, and plant
vineyards, And they make fruits of increase.

<span id="an_107:38">107:38</span> And He blesseth them, and they
multiply exceedingly, And their cattle He doth not diminish.

<span id="an_107:39">107:39</span> And they are diminished, and bow
down, By restraint, evil, and sorrow.

<span id="an_107:40">107:40</span> He is pouring contempt upon nobles,
And causeth them to wander in vacancy -- no way.

<span id="an_107:41">107:41</span> And setteth on high the needy from
affliction, And placeth families as a flock.

<span id="an_107:42">107:42</span> The upright do see and rejoice, And
all perversity hath shut her mouth.

<span id="an_107:43">107:43</span> Who \[is\] wise, and observeth these?
They understand the kind acts of Jehovah!

<span id="an_108:1">108:1</span> A Song, a Psalm of David. Prepared is
my heart, O God, I sing, yea, I sing praise, also my honour.

<span id="an_108:2">108:2</span> Awake, psaltery and harp, I awake the
dawn.

<span id="an_108:3">108:3</span> I thank Thee among peoples, O Jehovah,
And I praise Thee among the nations.

<span id="an_108:4">108:4</span> For great above the heavens \[is\] Thy
kindness, And unto the clouds Thy truth.

<span id="an_108:5">108:5</span> Be Thou exalted above the heavens, O
God, And above all the earth Thy honour.

<span id="an_108:6">108:6</span> That Thy beloved ones may be delivered,
Save \[with\] Thy right hand, and answer us.

<span id="an_108:7">108:7</span> God hath spoken in His holiness: I
exult, I apportion Shechem, And the valley of Succoth I measure,

<span id="an_108:8">108:8</span> Mine \[is\] Gilead, mine \[is\]
Manasseh, And Ephraim \[is\] the strength of my head, Judah \[is\] my
lawgiver,

<span id="an_108:9">108:9</span> Moab \[is\] a pot for my washing, Upon
Edom I cast my shoe, Over Philistia I shout habitually.

<span id="an_108:10">108:10</span> Who doth bring me in to the fenced
city? Who hath led me unto Edom?

<span id="an_108:11">108:11</span> Hast not Thou, O God, cast us off?
And Thou goest not out, O God, with our hosts!

<span id="an_108:12">108:12</span> Give to us help from adversity, And
vain is the salvation of man.

<span id="an_108:13">108:13</span> In God we do mightily, And He doth
tread down our adversaries!

<span id="an_109:1">109:1</span> To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. O
God of my praise, be not silent,

<span id="an_109:2">109:2</span> For the mouth of wickedness, and the
mouth of deceit, Against me they have opened, They have spoken with me
-- A tongue of falsehood, and words of hatred!

<span id="an_109:3">109:3</span> They have compassed me about, And they
fight me without cause.

<span id="an_109:4">109:4</span> For my love they oppose me, and I --
prayer!

<span id="an_109:5">109:5</span> And they set against me evil for good,
And hatred for my love.

<span id="an_109:6">109:6</span> Appoint Thou over him the wicked, And
an adversary standeth at his right hand.

<span id="an_109:7">109:7</span> In his being judged, he goeth forth
wicked, And his prayer is for sin.

<span id="an_109:8">109:8</span> His days are few, his oversight another
taketh,

<span id="an_109:9">109:9</span> His sons are fatherless, and his wife a
widow.

<span id="an_109:10">109:10</span> And wander continually do his sons,
Yea, they have begged, And have sought out of their dry places.

<span id="an_109:11">109:11</span> An exactor layeth a snare for all
that he hath, And strangers spoil his labour.

<span id="an_109:12">109:12</span> He hath none to extend kindness, Nor
is there one showing favour to his orphans.

<span id="an_109:13">109:13</span> His posterity is for cutting off, In
another generation is their name blotted out.

<span id="an_109:14">109:14</span> The iniquity of his fathers Is
remembered unto Jehovah, And the sin of his mother is not blotted out.

<span id="an_109:15">109:15</span> They are before Jehovah continually,
And He cutteth off from earth their memorial.

<span id="an_109:16">109:16</span> Because that he hath not remembered
to do kindness, And pursueth the poor man and needy, And the smitten of
heart -- to slay,

<span id="an_109:17">109:17</span> And he loveth reviling, and it
meeteth him, And he hath not delighted in blessing, And it is far from
him.

<span id="an_109:18">109:18</span> And he putteth on reviling as his
robe, And it cometh in as water into his midst, And as oil into his
bones.

<span id="an_109:19">109:19</span> It is to him as apparel -- he
covereth himself, And for a continual girdle he girdeth it on.

<span id="an_109:20">109:20</span> This \[is\] the wage of mine accusers
from Jehovah, And of those speaking evil against my soul.

<span id="an_109:21">109:21</span> And Thou, O Jehovah Lord, Deal with
me for Thy name's sake, Because Thy kindness \[is\] good, deliver me.

<span id="an_109:22">109:22</span> For I \[am\] poor and needy, And my
heart hath been pierced in my midst.

<span id="an_109:23">109:23</span> As a shadow when it is stretched out
I have gone, I have been driven away as a locust.

<span id="an_109:24">109:24</span> My knees have been feeble from
fasting, And my flesh hath failed of fatness.

<span id="an_109:25">109:25</span> And I -- I have been a reproach to
them, They see me, they shake their head.

<span id="an_109:26">109:26</span> Help me, O Jehovah my God, Save me,
according to Thy kindness.

<span id="an_109:27">109:27</span> And they know that this \[is\] Thy
hand, Thou, O Jehovah, Thou hast done it.

<span id="an_109:28">109:28</span> They revile, and Thou dost bless,
They have risen, and are ashamed, And Thy servant doth rejoice.

<span id="an_109:29">109:29</span> Mine accusers put on blushing, and
are covered, As an upper robe \[is\] their shame.

<span id="an_109:30">109:30</span> I thank Jehovah greatly with my
mouth, And in the midst of many I praise Him,

<span id="an_109:31">109:31</span> For He standeth at the right hand of
the needy, To save from those judging his soul.

<span id="an_110:1">110:1</span> A Psalm of David. The affirmation of
Jehovah to my Lord: \`Sit at My right hand, Till I make thine enemies
thy footstool.'

<span id="an_110:2">110:2</span> The rod of thy strength doth Jehovah
send from Zion, Rule in the midst of thine enemies.

<span id="an_110:3">110:3</span> Thy people \[are\] free-will gifts in
the day of Thy strength, in the honours of holiness, From the womb, from
the morning, Thou hast the dew of thy youth.

<span id="an_110:4">110:4</span> Jehovah hath sworn, and doth not
repent, \`Thou \[art\] a priest to the age, According to the order of
Melchizedek.'

<span id="an_110:5">110:5</span> The Lord on thy right hand smote kings
In the day of His anger.

<span id="an_110:6">110:6</span> He doth judge among the nations, He
hath completed the carcases, Hath smitten the head over the mighty
earth.

<span id="an_110:7">110:7</span> From a brook in the way he drinketh,
Therefore he doth lift up the head!

<span id="an_111:1">111:1</span> Praise ye Jah! I thank Jehovah with the
whole heart, In the secret meeting of the upright, And of the company.

<span id="an_111:2">111:2</span> Great \[are\] the works of Jehovah,
Sought out by all desiring them.

<span id="an_111:3">111:3</span> Honourable and majestic is His work,
And His righteousness is standing for ever.

<span id="an_111:4">111:4</span> A memorial He hath made of His wonders,
Gracious and merciful \[is\] Jehovah.

<span id="an_111:5">111:5</span> Prey He hath given to those fearing
Him, He remembereth to the age His covenant.

<span id="an_111:6">111:6</span> The power of His works He hath declared
to His people, To give to them the inheritance of nations.

<span id="an_111:7">111:7</span> The works of His hands \[are\] true and
just, Stedfast \[are\] all His appointments.

<span id="an_111:8">111:8</span> They are sustained for ever to the age.
They are made in truth and uprightness.

<span id="an_111:9">111:9</span> Redemption He hath sent to His people,
He hath appointed to the age His covenant, Holy and fearful \[is\] His
name.

<span id="an_111:10">111:10</span> The beginning of wisdom \[is\] fear
of Jehovah, Good understanding have all doing them, His praise \[is\]
standing for ever!

<span id="an_112:1">112:1</span> Praise ye Jah! O the happiness of one
fearing Jehovah, In His commands he hath delighted greatly.

<span id="an_112:2">112:2</span> Mighty in the earth is his seed, The
generation of the upright is blessed.

<span id="an_112:3">112:3</span> Wealth and riches \[are\] in his house,
And his righteousness is standing for ever.

<span id="an_112:4">112:4</span> Light hath risen in darkness to the
upright, Gracious, and merciful, and righteous.

<span id="an_112:5">112:5</span> Good \[is\] the man -- gracious and
lending, He sustaineth his matters in judgment.

<span id="an_112:6">112:6</span> For -- to the age he is not moved; For
a memorial age-during is the righteous.

<span id="an_112:7">112:7</span> Of an evil report he is not afraid,
Prepared is His heart, confident in Jehovah.

<span id="an_112:8">112:8</span> Sustained is his heart -- he feareth
not, Till that he look on his adversaries.

<span id="an_112:9">112:9</span> He hath scattered -- hath given to the
needy, His righteousness is standing for ever, His horn is exalted with
honour.

<span id="an_112:10">112:10</span> The wicked seeth, and hath been
angry, His teeth he gnasheth, and hath melted, The desire of the wicked
doth perish!

<span id="an_113:1">113:1</span> Praise ye Jah! Praise, ye servants of
Jehovah. Praise the name of Jehovah.

<span id="an_113:2">113:2</span> The name of Jehovah is blessed, From

exalting \[Himself\] to sit?

<span id="an_113:6">113:6</span> He is humbling \[Himself\] to look On
the heavens and on the earth.

<span id="an_113:7">113:7</span> He is raising up from the dust the
poor, From a dunghill He exalteth the needy.

<span id="an_113:8">113:8</span> To cause to sit with princes, With the
princes of His people.

<span id="an_113:9">113:9</span> Causing the barren one of the house to
sit, A joyful mother of sons; praise ye Jah!

<span id="an_114:1">114:1</span> In the going out of Israel from Egypt,
The house of Jacob from a strange people,

<span id="an_114:2">114:2</span> Judah became His sanctuary, Israel his
dominion.

<span id="an_114:3">114:3</span> The sea hath seen, and fleeth, The
Jordan turneth backward.

<span id="an_114:4">114:4</span> The mountains have skipped as rams,
Heights as sons of a flock.

<span id="an_114:5">114:5</span> What -- to thee, O sea, that thou
fleest? O Jordan, thou turnest back!

<span id="an_114:6">114:6</span> O mountains, ye skip as rams! O
heights, as sons of a flock!

<span id="an_114:7">114:7</span> From before the Lord be afraid, O
earth, From before the God of Jacob,

<span id="an_114:8">114:8</span> He is turning the rock to a pool of
waters, The flint to a fountain of waters!

<span id="an_115:1">115:1</span> Not to us, O Jehovah, not to us, But to
Thy name give honour, For Thy kindness, for Thy truth.

<span id="an_115:2">115:2</span> Why do the nations say, \`Where, pray,
\[is\] their God.

<span id="an_115:3">115:3</span> And our God \[is\] in the heavens, All
that He hath pleased He hath done.

<span id="an_115:4">115:4</span> Their idols \[are\] silver and gold,
work of man's hands,

<span id="an_115:5">115:5</span> A mouth they have, and they speak not,
Eyes they have, and they see not,

<span id="an_115:6">115:6</span> Ears they have, and they hear not, A
nose they have, and they smell not,

<span id="an_115:7">115:7</span> Their hands, but they handle not, Their
feet, and they walk not;

<span id="an_115:8">115:8</span> Nor do they mutter through their
throat, Like them are their makers, Every one who is trusting in them.

<span id="an_115:9">115:9</span> O Israel, trust in Jehovah, \`Their
help and their shield \[is\] He.'

<span id="an_115:10">115:10</span> O house of Aaron, trust in Jehovah,
\`Their help and their shield \[is\] He.'

\`Their help and their shield \[is\] He.'

<span id="an_115:12">115:12</span> Jehovah hath remembered us, He
blesseth, He blesseth the house of Israel, He blesseth the house of
Aaron,

<span id="an_115:13">115:13</span> He blesseth those fearing Jehovah,
The small with the great.

<span id="an_115:14">115:14</span> Jehovah addeth to you, to you, and to
your sons.

<span id="an_115:15">115:15</span> Blessed \[are\] ye of Jehovah, maker
of heaven and earth,

<span id="an_115:16">115:16</span> The heavens -- the heavens \[are\]
Jehovah's, And the earth He hath given to sons of men,

<span id="an_115:17">115:17</span> The dead praise not Jah, Nor any

<span id="an_118:10">118:10</span> All nations have compassed me about,
In the name of Jehovah I surely cut them off.

<span id="an_118:11">118:11</span> They have compassed me about, Yea,

<span id="an_119:131">119:131</span> My mouth I have opened, yea, I
pant, For, for Thy commands I have longed.

<span id="an_119:132">119:132</span> Look unto me, and favour me, As
customary to those loving Thy name.

And any iniquity doth not rule over me.

<span id="an_119:134">119:134</span> Ransom me from the oppression of
man, And I observe Thy precepts,

servant, And teach me Thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:136">119:136</span> Rivulets of waters have come down
mine eyes, Because they have not kept Thy law!

<span id="an_119:137">119:137</span> \[Tzade.\] Righteous \[art\] Thou,
O Jehovah, And upright \[are\] Thy judgments.

<span id="an_119:138">119:138</span> Thou hast appointed Thy
testimonies, Righteous and exceeding faithful,

<span id="an_119:139">119:139</span> Cut me off hath my zeal, For mine
adversaries forgot Thy words.

<span id="an_119:140">119:140</span> Tried \[is\] thy saying
exceedingly, And Thy servant hath loved it.

<span id="an_119:141">119:141</span> Small I \[am\], and despised, Thy
precepts I have not forgotten.

<span id="an_119:142">119:142</span> Thy righteousness \[is\]
righteousness to the age, And Thy law \[is\] truth.

<span id="an_119:143">119:143</span> Adversity and distress have found
me, Thy commands \[are\] my delights.

<span id="an_119:144">119:144</span> The righteousness of Thy
testimonies \[is\] to Cause me to understand, and I live!

<span id="an_119:145">119:145</span> \[Koph.\] I have called with the
whole heart, Answer me, O Jehovah, Thy statutes I keep,

<span id="an_119:146">119:146</span> I have called Thee, save Thou me,
And I do keep Thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:147">119:147</span> I have gone forward in the dawn,
and I cry, For Thy word I have hoped.

<span id="an_119:148">119:148</span> Mine eyes have gone before the
watches, To meditate in Thy saying.

<span id="an_119:150">119:150</span> Near have been my wicked pursuers,
From Thy law they have been far off.

all Thy commands \[are\] truth.

<span id="an_119:152">119:152</span> Of old I have known Thy
testimonies, That to the age Thou hast founded them!

<span id="an_119:153">119:153</span> \[Resh.\] See my affliction, and

According to Thy saying quicken me.

Jehovah, According to Thy judgments quicken me.

<span id="an_119:157">119:157</span> Many \[are\] my pursuers, and
adversaries, From Thy testimonies I have not turned aside.

<span id="an_119:158">119:158</span> I have seen treacherous ones, And
grieve myself, Because Thy saying they have not kept.

<span id="an_119:159">119:159</span> See, for thy precepts I have loved,
Jehovah, According to Thy kindness quicken me.

<span id="an_119:160">119:160</span> The sum of Thy word \[is\] truth,
And to the age \[is\] every judgment of Thy righteousness!

<span id="an_119:161">119:161</span> \[Shin.\] Princes have pursued me
without cause, And because of Thy words was my heart afraid.

<span id="an_119:162">119:162</span> I do rejoice concerning Thy saying,
As one finding abundant spoil.

<span id="an_119:163">119:163</span> Falsehood I have hated, yea I
abominate \[it\], Thy law I have loved.

<span id="an_119:164">119:164</span> Seven \[times\] in a day I have
praised Thee, Because of the judgments of Thy righteousness.

<span id="an_119:165">119:165</span> Abundant peace have those loving
Thy law, And they have no stumbling-block.

<span id="an_119:166">119:166</span> I have waited for Thy salvation, O

<span id="an_119:167">119:167</span> Kept hath my soul Thy testimonies,
And I do love them exceedingly.

<span id="an_119:168">119:168</span> I have kept Thy precepts and Thy
testimonies, For all my ways are before Thee!

<span id="an_119:169">119:169</span> \[Taw.\] My loud cry cometh near
before Thee, O Jehovah; According to Thy word cause me to understand.

<span id="an_119:170">119:170</span> My supplication cometh in before
Thee, According to Thy saying deliver Thou me.

<span id="an_119:171">119:171</span> My lips do utter praise, For Thou
dost teach me Thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:172">119:172</span> My tongue doth sing of Thy saying,
For all Thy commands \[are\] righteous.

<span id="an_119:173">119:173</span> Thy hand is for a help to me, For
Thy commands I have chosen.

<span id="an_119:174">119:174</span> I have longed for Thy salvation, O
Jehovah, And Thy law \[is\] my delight.

<span id="an_119:175">119:175</span> My soul liveth, and it doth praise
Thee, And Thy judgments do help me.

<span id="an_119:176">119:176</span> I wandered as a lost sheep, seek
Thy servant, For Thy precepts I have not forgotten!

<span id="an_120:1">120:1</span> A Song of the Ascents. Unto Jehovah in
my distress I have called, And He answereth me.

<span id="an_120:2">120:2</span> O Jehovah, deliver my soul from a lying
lip, From a deceitful tongue!

<span id="an_120:3">120:3</span> What doth He give to thee? And what
doth He add to thee? O deceitful tongue!

<span id="an_120:4">120:4</span> Sharp arrows of a mighty one, with
broom-coals.

<span id="an_120:5">120:5</span> Wo to me, for I have inhabited Mesech,
I have dwelt with tents of Kedar.

<span id="an_120:6">120:6</span> Too much hath my soul dwelt with him
who is hating peace.

<span id="an_120:7">120:7</span> I \[am\] peace, and when I speak they
\[are\] for war!

<span id="an_121:1">121:1</span> A Song of the Ascents. I lift up mine
eyes unto the hills, Whence doth my help come?

<span id="an_121:2">121:2</span> My help \[is\] from Jehovah, maker of
heaven and earth,

<span id="an_121:3">121:3</span> He suffereth not thy foot to be moved,
Thy preserver slumbereth not.

<span id="an_121:4">121:4</span> Lo, He slumbereth not, nor sleepeth, He
who is preserving Israel.

<span id="an_121:5">121:5</span> Jehovah \[is\] thy preserver, Jehovah
\[is\] thy shade on thy right hand,

<span id="an_121:6">121:6</span> By day the sun doth not smite thee, Nor
the moon by night.

<span id="an_121:7">121:7</span> Jehovah preserveth thee from all evil,
He doth preserve thy soul.

<span id="an_121:8">121:8</span> Jehovah preserveth thy going out and
thy coming in, From henceforth even unto the age!

<span id="an_122:1">122:1</span> A Song of the Ascents, by David. I have
rejoiced in those saying to me, \`To the house of Jehovah we go.'

<span id="an_122:2">122:2</span> Our feet have been standing in thy
gates, O Jerusalem!

<span id="an_122:3">122:3</span> Jerusalem -- the builded one -- \[Is\]
as a city that is joined to itself together.

<span id="an_122:4">122:4</span> For thither have tribes gone up, Tribes
of Jah, companies of Israel, To give thanks to the name of Jehovah.

<span id="an_122:5">122:5</span> For there have sat thrones of judgment,
Thrones of the house of David.

<span id="an_122:6">122:6</span> Ask ye the peace of Jerusalem, At rest
are those loving thee.

<span id="an_122:7">122:7</span> Peace is in thy bulwark, rest in thy
high places,

<span id="an_122:8">122:8</span> For the sake of my brethren and my
companions, Let me speak, I pray thee, \`Peace \[be\] in thee.'

<span id="an_122:9">122:9</span> For the sake of the house of Jehovah
our God, I seek good for thee!

<span id="an_123:1">123:1</span> A Song of the Ascents. Unto Thee I have
lifted up mine eyes, O dweller in the heavens.

<span id="an_123:2">123:2</span> Lo, as eyes of men-servants \[Are\]
unto the hand of their masters, As eyes of a maid-servant \[Are\] unto
the hand of her mistress, So \[are\] our eyes unto Jehovah our God, Till
that He doth favour us.

<span id="an_123:3">123:3</span> Favour us, O Jehovah, favour us, For
greatly have we been filled with contempt,

<span id="an_123:4">123:4</span> Greatly hath our soul been filled With
the scorning of the easy ones, With the contempt of the arrogant!

<span id="an_124:1">124:1</span> A Song of the Ascents, by David. Save
\[for\] Jehovah -- who hath been for us, (Pray, let Israel say),

<span id="an_124:2">124:2</span> Save \[for\] Jehovah -- who hath been
for us, In the rising up of man against us,

<span id="an_124:3">124:3</span> Then alive they had swallowed us up, In
the burning of their anger against us,

<span id="an_124:4">124:4</span> Then the waters had overflowed us, The
stream passed over our soul,

<span id="an_124:5">124:5</span> Then passed over our soul had the proud
waters.

<span id="an_124:6">124:6</span> Blessed \[is\] Jehovah who hath not
given us, A prey to their teeth.

<span id="an_124:7">124:7</span> Our soul as a bird hath escaped from a
snare of fowlers, The snare was broken, and we have escaped.

<span id="an_124:8">124:8</span> Our help \[is\] in the name of Jehovah,
Maker of the heavens and earth!

<span id="an_125:1">125:1</span> A Song of the Ascents. Those trusting
in Jehovah \[are\] as Mount Zion, It is not moved -- to the age it
abideth.

<span id="an_125:2">125:2</span> Jerusalem! mountains \[are\] round
about her, And Jehovah \[is\] round about His people, From henceforth
even unto the age.

<span id="an_125:3">125:3</span> For the rod of wickedness resteth not
On the lot of the righteous, That the righteous put not forth on
iniquity their hands.

<span id="an_125:4">125:4</span> Do good, O Jehovah, to the good, And to
the upright in their hearts.

<span id="an_125:5">125:5</span> As to those turning \[to\] their
crooked ways, Jehovah causeth them to go with workers of iniquity. Peace
on Israel!

<span id="an_126:1">126:1</span> A Song of the Ascents. In Jehovah's
turning back \[to\] the captivity of Zion, We have been as dreamers.

<span id="an_126:2">126:2</span> Then filled \[with\] laughter is our
mouth, And our tongue \[with\] singing, Then do they say among nations,
\`Jehovah did great things with these.'

<span id="an_126:3">126:3</span> Jehovah did great things with us, We
have been joyful.

<span id="an_126:4">126:4</span> Turn again, O Jehovah, \[to\] our
captivity, As streams in the south.

<span id="an_126:5">126:5</span> Those sowing in tears, with singing do
reap,

<span id="an_126:6">126:6</span> Whoso goeth on and weepeth, Bearing the
basket of seed, Surely cometh in with singing, bearing his sheaves!

<span id="an_127:1">127:1</span> A Song of the Ascents, by Solomon. If
Jehovah doth not build the house, In vain have its builders laboured at
it, If Jehovah doth not watch a city, In vain hath a watchman waked.

<span id="an_127:2">127:2</span> Vain for you who are rising early, Who
delay sitting, eating the bread of griefs, So He giveth to His beloved
one sleep.

<span id="an_127:3">127:3</span> Lo, an inheritance of Jehovah \[are\]
sons, A reward \[is\] the fruit of the womb.

<span id="an_127:4">127:4</span> As arrows in the hand of a mighty one,
So \[are\] the sons of the young men.

<span id="an_127:5">127:5</span> O the happiness of the man Who hath
filled his quiver with them, They are not ashamed, For they speak with
enemies in the gate!

<span id="an_128:1">128:1</span> A Song of the Ascents. O the happiness
of every one fearing Jehovah, Who is walking in His ways.

<span id="an_128:2">128:2</span> The labour of thy hands thou surely
eatest, Happy \[art\] thou, and good \[is\] to thee.

<span id="an_128:3">128:3</span> Thy wife \[is\] as a fruitful vine in
the sides of thy house, Thy sons as olive plants around thy table.

<span id="an_128:4">128:4</span> Lo, surely thus is the man blessed who
is fearing Jehovah.

<span id="an_128:5">128:5</span> Jehovah doth bless thee out of Zion,
Look, then, on the good of Jerusalem, All the days of thy life,

<span id="an_128:6">128:6</span> And see the sons of thy sons! Peace on
Israel!

<span id="an_129:1">129:1</span> A Song of the Ascents. Often they
distressed me from my youth, Pray, let Israel say:

<span id="an_129:2">129:2</span> Often they distressed me from my youth,
Yet they have not prevailed over me.

<span id="an_129:3">129:3</span> Over my back have ploughers ploughed,
They have made long their furrows.

<span id="an_129:4">129:4</span> Jehovah \[is\] righteous, He hath cut
asunder cords of the wicked.

<span id="an_129:5">129:5</span> Confounded and turn backward do all
hating Zion.

<span id="an_129:6">129:6</span> They are as grass of the roofs, That
before it was drawn out withereth,

<span id="an_129:7">129:7</span> That hath not filled the hand of a
reaper, And the bosom of a binder of sheaves.

<span id="an_129:8">129:8</span> And the passers by have not said, \`The
blessing of Jehovah \[is\] on you, We blessed you in the Name of
Jehovah!'

<span id="an_130:1">130:1</span> A Song of the Ascents. From depths I
have called Thee, Jehovah.

<span id="an_130:2">130:2</span> Lord, hearken to my voice, Thine ears
are attentive to the voice of my supplications.

<span id="an_130:3">130:3</span> If iniquities Thou dost observe, O
Lord, who doth stand?

<span id="an_130:4">130:4</span> But with Thee \[is\] forgiveness, that
Thou mayest be feared.

<span id="an_130:5">130:5</span> I hoped \[for\] Jehovah -- hoped hath
my soul, And for His word I have waited.

<span id="an_130:6">130:6</span> My soul \[is\] for the Lord, More than
those watching for morning, Watching for morning!

<span id="an_130:7">130:7</span> Israel doth wait on Jehovah, For with
Jehovah \[is\] kindness, And abundant with Him \[is\] redemption.

<span id="an_130:8">130:8</span> And He doth redeem Israel from all his
iniquities!

<span id="an_131:1">131:1</span> A Song of the Ascents, by David.
Jehovah, my heart hath not been haughty, Nor have mine eyes been high,
Nor have I walked in great things, And in things too wonderful for me.

<span id="an_131:2">131:2</span> Have I not compared, and kept silent my
soul, As a weaned one by its mother? As a weaned one by me \[is\] my
soul.

<span id="an_131:3">131:3</span> Israel doth wait on Jehovah, From
henceforth, and unto the age!

<span id="an_132:1">132:1</span> A Song of the Ascents. Remember,
Jehovah, for David, all his afflictions.

<span id="an_132:2">132:2</span> Who hath sworn to Jehovah. He hath
vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:

<span id="an_132:3">132:3</span> \`If I enter into the tent of my house,
If I go up on the couch of my bed,

<span id="an_132:4">132:4</span> If I give sleep to mine eyes, To mine
eyelids -- slumber,

<span id="an_132:5">132:5</span> Till I do find a place for Jehovah,
Tabernacles for the Mighty One of Jacob.

<span id="an_132:6">132:6</span> \`Lo, we have heard it in Ephratah, We
have found it in the fields of the forest.

<span id="an_132:7">132:7</span> We come in to His tabernacles, We bow
ourselves at His footstool.

<span id="an_132:8">132:8</span> Arise, O Jehovah, to Thy rest, Thou,
and the ark of Thy strength,

<span id="an_132:9">132:9</span> Thy priests do put on righteousness,
And Thy pious ones cry aloud.

<span id="an_132:10">132:10</span> For the sake of David Thy servant,
Turn not back the face of Thine anointed.

<span id="an_132:11">132:11</span> Jehovah hath sworn truth to David, He
turneth not back from it: Of the fruit of thy body, I set on the throne
for thee.

<span id="an_132:12">132:12</span> If thy sons keep My covenant, And My
testimonies that I teach them, Their sons also for ever and ever, Do sit
on the throne for thee.

<span id="an_132:13">132:13</span> For Jehovah hath fixed on Zion, He
hath desired \[it\] for a seat to Himself,

<span id="an_132:14">132:14</span> This \[is\] My rest for ever and
ever, Here do I sit, for I have desired it.

<span id="an_132:15">132:15</span> Her provision I greatly bless, Her
needy ones I satisfy \[with\] bread,

<span id="an_132:16">132:16</span> And her priests I clothe \[with\]
salvation, And her pious ones do sing aloud.

<span id="an_132:17">132:17</span> There I cause to spring up a horn for
David, I have arranged a lamp for Mine anointed.

<span id="an_132:18">132:18</span> His enemies I do clothe \[with\]
shame, And upon him doth his crown flourish!

<span id="an_133:1">133:1</span> A Song of the Ascents, by David. Lo,
how good and how pleasant The dwelling of brethren -- even together!

<span id="an_133:2">133:2</span> As the good oil on the head, Coming
down on the beard, the beard of Aaron, That cometh down on the skirt of
his robes,

<span id="an_133:3">133:3</span> As dew of Hermon -- That cometh down on
hills of Zion, For there Jehovah commanded the blessing -- Life unto the
age!

<span id="an_134:1">134:1</span> A Song of the Ascents. Lo, bless
Jehovah, all servants of Jehovah, Who are standing in the house of
Jehovah by night.

<span id="an_134:2">134:2</span> Lift up your hands \[in\] the
sanctuary, And bless ye Jehovah.

<span id="an_134:3">134:3</span> Jehovah doth bless thee out of Zion,
The maker of the heavens and earth!

<span id="an_135:1">135:1</span> Praise ye Jah! Praise ye the name of
Jehovah, Praise, ye servants of Jehovah,

<span id="an_135:2">135:2</span> Who are standing in the house of
Jehovah, In the courts of the house of our God.

<span id="an_135:3">135:3</span> Praise ye Jah! for Jehovah \[is\] good,
Sing praise to His name, for \[it is\] pleasant.

<span id="an_135:4">135:4</span> For Jacob hath Jah chosen for Himself,
Israel for His peculiar treasure.

<span id="an_135:5">135:5</span> For I have known that great \[is\]
Jehovah, Yea, our Lord \[is\] above all gods.

<span id="an_135:6">135:6</span> All that Jehovah pleased He hath done,
In the heavens and in earth, In the seas and all deep places,

<span id="an_135:7">135:7</span> Causing vapours to ascend from the end
of the earth, Lightnings for the rain He hath made, Bringing forth wind
from His treasures.

<span id="an_135:8">135:8</span> Who smote the first-born of Egypt, From
man unto beast.

<span id="an_135:9">135:9</span> He sent tokens and wonders into thy
midst, O Egypt, On Pharaoh and on all his servants.

<span id="an_135:10">135:10</span> Who smote many nations, and slew
strong kings,

<span id="an_135:11">135:11</span> Even Sihon king of the Amorite, And
Og king of Bashan, And all kingdoms of Canaan.

<span id="an_135:12">135:12</span> And He gave their land an
inheritance, An inheritance to Israel His people,

<span id="an_135:13">135:13</span> O Jehovah, Thy name \[is\] to the
age, O Jehovah, Thy memorial to all generations.

<span id="an_135:14">135:14</span> For Jehovah doth judge His people,
And for His servants comforteth Himself.

<span id="an_135:15">135:15</span> The idols of the nations \[are\]
silver and gold, Work of the hands of man.

<span id="an_135:16">135:16</span> A mouth they have, and they speak
not, Eyes they have, and they see not,

<span id="an_135:17">135:17</span> Ears they have, and they give not
ear, Nose -- there is no breath in their mouth!

<span id="an_135:18">135:18</span> Like them are their makers, Every one
who is trusting in them.

<span id="an_135:19">135:19</span> O house of Israel, bless ye Jehovah,
O house of Aaron, bless ye Jehovah,

<span id="an_135:20">135:20</span> O house of Levi, bless ye Jehovah,
Those fearing Jehovah, bless ye Jehovah.

<span id="an_135:21">135:21</span> Blessed \[is\] Jehovah from Zion,
Inhabiting Jerusalem -- praise ye Jah!

<span id="an_136:1">136:1</span> Give ye thanks to Jehovah, For good,

<span id="an_137:1">137:1</span> By rivers of Babylon -- There we did
sit, Yea, we wept when we remembered Zion.

<span id="an_137:2">137:2</span> On willows in its midst we hung our
harps.

<span id="an_137:3">137:3</span> For there our captors asked us the
words of a song, And our spoilers -- joy: \`Sing ye to us of a song of
Zion.'

<span id="an_137:4">137:4</span> How do we sing the song of Jehovah, On
the land of a stranger?

<span id="an_137:5">137:5</span> If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, my right
hand forgetteth!

<span id="an_137:6">137:6</span> My tongue doth cleave to my palate, If
I do not remember thee, If I do not exalt Jerusalem above my chief joy.

<span id="an_137:7">137:7</span> Remember, Jehovah, for the sons of
Edom, The day of Jerusalem, Those saying, \`Rase, rase to its
foundation!'

<span id="an_137:8">137:8</span> O daughter of Babylon, O destroyed one,
O the happiness of him who repayeth to thee thy deed, That thou hast
done to us.

<span id="an_137:9">137:9</span> O the happiness of him who doth seize,
And hath dashed thy sucklings on the rock!

<span id="an_138:1">138:1</span> By David. I confess Thee, with all my
heart, Before the gods I do praise Thee.

<span id="an_138:2">138:2</span> I bow myself toward Thy holy temple,
And I confess Thy name, For Thy kindness, and for Thy truth, For Thou
hast made great Thy saying above all Thy name.

<span id="an_138:3">138:3</span> In the day I called, when Thou dost
answer me, Thou dost strengthen me in my soul \[with\] strength.

<span id="an_138:4">138:4</span> O Jehovah, all kings of earth confess
Thee, When they have heard the sayings of Thy mouth.

<span id="an_138:5">138:5</span> And they sing in the ways of Jehovah,
For great \[is\] the honour of Jehovah.

<span id="an_138:6">138:6</span> For high \[is\] Jehovah, and the lowly
He seeth, And the haughty from afar He knoweth.

<span id="an_138:7">138:7</span> If I walk in the midst of distress Thou
quickenest me, Against the anger of mine enemies Thou sendest forth Thy
hand, And Thy right hand doth save me.

<span id="an_138:8">138:8</span> Jehovah doth perfect for me, O Jehovah,
Thy kindness \[is\] to the age, The works of Thy hands let not fall!

<span id="an_139:1">139:1</span> To the Overseer. -- A Psalm by David.
Jehovah, Thou hast searched me, and knowest.

<span id="an_139:2">139:2</span> Thou -- Thou hast known my sitting
down, And my rising up, Thou hast attended to my thoughts from afar.

<span id="an_139:3">139:3</span> My path and my couch Thou hast fanned,
And \[with\] all my ways hast been acquainted.

<span id="an_139:4">139:4</span> For there is not a word in my tongue,
Lo, O Jehovah, Thou hast known it all!

<span id="an_139:5">139:5</span> Behind and before Thou hast besieged
me, And Thou dost place on me Thy hand.

<span id="an_139:6">139:6</span> Knowledge too wonderful for me, It hath
been set on high, I am not able for it.

<span id="an_139:7">139:7</span> Whither do I go from Thy Spirit? And
whither from Thy face do I flee?

<span id="an_139:8">139:8</span> If I ascend the heavens -- there Thou
\[art\], And spread out a couch in Sheol, lo, Thee!

<span id="an_139:9">139:9</span> I take the wings of morning, I dwell in
the uttermost part of the sea,

<span id="an_139:10">139:10</span> Also there Thy hand doth lead me, And
Thy right hand doth hold me.

<span id="an_139:11">139:11</span> And I say, \`Surely darkness bruiseth
me, Then night \[is\] light to me.

<span id="an_139:12">139:12</span> Also darkness hideth not from Thee,
And night as day shineth, as \[is\] darkness so \[is\] light.

<span id="an_139:13">139:13</span> For Thou -- Thou hast possessed my
reins, Thou dost cover me in my mother's belly.

<span id="an_139:14">139:14</span> I confess Thee, because that \[with\]
wonders I have been distinguished. Wonderful \[are\] Thy works, And my
soul is knowing \[it\] well.

<span id="an_139:15">139:15</span> My substance was not hid from Thee,
When I was made in secret, Curiously wrought in the lower part of earth.

<span id="an_139:16">139:16</span> Mine unformed substance Thine eyes
saw, And on Thy book all of them are written, The days they were formed
-- And not one among them.

<span id="an_139:17">139:17</span> And to me how precious have been Thy
thoughts, O God, how great hath been their sum!

<span id="an_139:18">139:18</span> I recount them! than the sand they
are more, I have waked, and I am still with Thee.

<span id="an_139:19">139:19</span> Dost Thou slay, O God, the wicked?
Then, men of blood, turn aside from me!

<span id="an_139:20">139:20</span> Who exchange Thee for wickedness,
Lifted up to vanity \[are\] Thine enemies.

<span id="an_139:21">139:21</span> Do not I hate, Jehovah, those hating
Thee? And with Thy withstanders grieve myself?

<span id="an_139:22">139:22</span> \[With\] perfect hatred I have hated
them, Enemies they have become to me.

<span id="an_139:23">139:23</span> Search me, O God, and know my heart,
Try me, and know my thoughts,

<span id="an_139:24">139:24</span> And see if a grievous way be in me,
And lead me in a way age-during!

<span id="an_140:1">140:1</span> To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David.
Deliver me, O Jehovah, from an evil man, From one of violence Thou
keepest me.

<span id="an_140:2">140:2</span> Who have devised evils in the heart,
All the day they assemble \[for\] wars.

<span id="an_140:3">140:3</span> They sharpened their tongue as a
serpent, Poison of an adder \[is\] under their lips. Selah.

<span id="an_140:4">140:4</span> Preserve me, Jehovah, from the hands of
the wicked, From one of violence Thou keepest me, Who have devised to
overthrow my steps.

<span id="an_140:5">140:5</span> The proud hid a snare for me -- and
cords, They spread a net by the side of the path, Snares they have set
for me. Selah.

<span id="an_140:6">140:6</span> I have said to Jehovah, \`My God
\[art\] Thou, Hear, Jehovah, the voice of my supplications.'

<span id="an_140:7">140:7</span> O Jehovah, my Lord, strength of my
salvation, Thou hast covered my head in the day of armour.

<span id="an_140:8">140:8</span> Grant not, O Jehovah, the desires of
the wicked, His wicked device bring not forth, They are high. Selah.

<span id="an_140:9">140:9</span> The chief of my surrounders, The
perverseness of their lips covereth them.

<span id="an_140:10">140:10</span> They cause to fall on themselves
burning coals, Into fire He doth cast them, Into deep pits -- they arise
not.

<span id="an_140:11">140:11</span> A talkative man is not established in
the earth, One of violence -- evil hunteth to overflowing.

<span id="an_140:12">140:12</span> I have known that Jehovah doth
execute The judgment of the afflicted, The judgment of the needy.

<span id="an_140:13">140:13</span> Only -- the righteous give thanks to
Thy name, The upright do dwell with Thy presence!

<span id="an_141:1">141:1</span> A Psalm, by David. O Jehovah, I have
called Thee, haste to me, Give ear \[to\] my voice when I call to Thee.

<span id="an_141:2">141:2</span> My prayer is prepared -- incense before
Thee, The lifting up of my hands -- the evening present.

<span id="an_141:3">141:3</span> Set, O Jehovah, a watch for my mouth,
Watch Thou over the door of my lips.

<span id="an_141:4">141:4</span> Incline not my heart to an evil thing,
To do habitually actions in wickedness, With men working iniquity, Yea,
I eat not of their pleasant things.

<span id="an_141:5">141:5</span> The righteous doth beat me \[in\]
kindness. And doth reprove me, Oil of the head my head disalloweth not,
For still my prayer \[is\] about their vexations.

<span id="an_141:6">141:6</span> Their judges have been released by the
sides of a rock, And they have heard my sayings, For they have been
pleasant.

<span id="an_141:7">141:7</span> As one tilling and ripping up in the
land, Have our bones been scattered at the command of Saul.

<span id="an_141:8">141:8</span> But to Thee, O Jehovah, my Lord,
\[are\] mine eyes, In Thee I have trusted, Make not bare my soul.

<span id="an_141:9">141:9</span> Keep me from the gin they laid for me,
Even snares of workers of iniquity.

<span id="an_141:10">141:10</span> The wicked fall in their nets
together, till I pass over!

<span id="an_142:1">142:1</span> An Instruction of David, a Prayer when
he is in the cave. My voice \[is\] unto Jehovah, I cry, My voice \[is\]
unto Jehovah, I entreat grace.

<span id="an_142:2">142:2</span> I pour forth before Him my meditation,
My distress before Him I declare.

<span id="an_142:3">142:3</span> When my spirit hath been feeble in me,
Then Thou hast known my path; In the way \[in\] which I walk, They have
hid a snare for me.

<span id="an_142:4">142:4</span> Looking on the right hand -- and
seeing, And I have none recognizing; Perished hath refuge from me, There
is none inquiring for my soul.

<span id="an_142:5">142:5</span> I have cried unto thee, O Jehovah, I
have said, \`Thou \[art\] my refuge, My portion in the land of the
living.'

<span id="an_142:6">142:6</span> Attend Thou unto my loud cry, For I
have become very low, Deliver Thou me from my pursuers, For they have
been stronger than I.

<span id="an_142:7">142:7</span> Bring forth from prison my soul to
confess Thy name, The righteous do compass me about, When Thou
conferrest benefits upon me!

<span id="an_143:1">143:1</span> A Psalm of David. O Jehovah, hear my
prayer, Give ear unto my supplications, In Thy faithfulness answer me --
in Thy righteousness.

<span id="an_143:2">143:2</span> And enter not into judgment with Thy
servant, For no one living is justified before Thee.

<span id="an_143:3">143:3</span> For an enemy hath pursued my soul, He
hath bruised to the earth my life, He hath caused me to dwell in dark
places, As the dead of old.

<span id="an_143:4">143:4</span> And my spirit in me is become feeble,
Within me is my heart become desolate.

<span id="an_143:5">143:5</span> I have remembered days of old, I have
meditated on all Thine acts, On the work of Thy hand I muse.

<span id="an_143:6">143:6</span> I have spread forth my hands unto Thee,
My soul \[is\] as a weary land for Thee. Selah.

<span id="an_143:7">143:7</span> Haste, answer me, O Jehovah, My spirit
hath been consumed, Hide not Thou Thy face from me, Or I have been
compared with those going down \[to\] the pit.

<span id="an_143:8">143:8</span> Cause me to hear in the morning Thy
kindness, For in Thee I have trusted, Cause me to know the way that I
go, For unto Thee I have lifted up my soul.

<span id="an_143:9">143:9</span> Deliver me from mine enemies, O
Jehovah, Near Thee I am covered.

<span id="an_143:10">143:10</span> Teach me to do Thy good pleasure, For
Thou \[art\] my God -- Thy Spirit \[is\] good, Lead me into a land of
uprightness.

<span id="an_143:11">143:11</span> For Thy name's sake O Jehovah, Thou
dost quicken me, In Thy righteousness, Thou bringest out from distress
my soul,

<span id="an_143:12">143:12</span> And in Thy kindness cuttest off mine
enemies, And hast destroyed all the adversaries of my soul, For I \[am\]
Thy servant!

<span id="an_144:1">144:1</span> By David. Blessed \[is\] Jehovah my
rock, who is teaching My hands for war, my fingers for battle.

<span id="an_144:2">144:2</span> My kind one, and my bulwark, My tower,
and my deliverer, My shield, and in whom I have trusted, Who is subduing
my people under me!

<span id="an_144:3">144:3</span> Jehovah, what \[is\] man that Thou
knowest him? Son of man, that Thou esteemest him?

<span id="an_144:4">144:4</span> Man to vanity hath been like, His days
\[are\] as a shadow passing by.

<span id="an_144:5">144:5</span> Jehovah, incline Thy heavens and come
down, Strike against mountains, and they smoke.

<span id="an_144:6">144:6</span> Send forth lightning, and scatter them,
Send forth Thine arrows, and trouble them,

<span id="an_144:7">144:7</span> Send forth Thy hand from on high, Free
me, and deliver me from many waters, From the hand of sons of a
stranger,

<span id="an_144:8">144:8</span> Because their mouth hath spoken vanity,
And their right hand \[is\] a right hand of falsehood.

<span id="an_144:9">144:9</span> O God, a new song I sing to Thee, On a
psaltery of ten strings I sing praise to Thee.

<span id="an_144:10">144:10</span> Who is giving deliverance to kings,
Who is freeing David His servant from the sword of evil.

<span id="an_144:11">144:11</span> Free me, and deliver me From the hand
of sons of a stranger, Because their mouth hath spoken vanity, And their
right hand \[is\] a right hand of falsehood,

<span id="an_144:12">144:12</span> Because our sons \[are\] as plants,
Becoming great in their youth, Our daughters as hewn stones, Polished --
the likeness of a palace,

<span id="an_144:13">144:13</span> Our garners \[are\] full, bringing
out from kind to kind, Our flocks are bringing forth thousands, Ten
thousands in our out-places,

<span id="an_144:14">144:14</span> Our oxen are carrying, there is no
breach, And there is no outgoing, And there is no crying in our broad
places.

<span id="an_144:15">144:15</span> O the happiness of the people that is
thus, O the happiness of the people whose God \[is\] Jehovah!

<span id="an_145:1">145:1</span> Praise by David. I exalt Thee, my God,
O king, And bless Thy name to the age and for ever.

<span id="an_145:8">145:8</span> Gracious and merciful \[is\] Jehovah,
Slow to anger, and great in kindness.

<span id="an_145:9">145:9</span> Good \[is\] Jehovah to all, And His

<span id="an_145:10">145:10</span> Confess Thee O Jehovah, do all Thy

<span id="an_145:11">145:11</span> The honour of Thy kingdom they tell,
And \[of\] Thy might they speak,

<span id="an_145:14">145:14</span> Jehovah is supporting all who are
falling, And raising up all who are bowed down.

<span id="an_145:15">145:15</span> The eyes of all unto Thee do look,
And Thou art giving to them their food in its season,

<span id="an_145:16">145:16</span> Opening Thy hand, and satisfying The
desire of every living thing.

<span id="an_145:17">145:17</span> Righteous \[is\] Jehovah in all His
ways, And kind in all His works.

<span id="an_145:18">145:18</span> Near \[is\] Jehovah to all those
calling Him, To all who call Him in truth.

<span id="an_145:19">145:19</span> The desire of those fearing Him He
doth, And their cry He heareth, and saveth them.

<span id="an_145:20">145:20</span> Jehovah preserveth all those loving

<span id="an_145:21">145:21</span> The praise of Jehovah my mouth

<span id="an_146:5">146:5</span> O the happiness of him Who hath the God
