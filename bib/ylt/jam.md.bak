### Young's Literal Translation: James

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> James, of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ
a servant, to the Twelve Tribes who are in the dispersion: Hail!

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> All joy count \[it\], my brethren, when ye
may fall into temptations manifold;

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> knowing that the proof of your faith doth
work endurance,

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> and let the endurance have a perfect work,
that ye may be perfect and entire -- in nothing lacking;

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> and if any of you do lack wisdom, let him
ask from God, who is giving to all liberally, and not reproaching, and
it shall be given to him;

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> and let him ask in faith, nothing doubting,
for he who is doubting hath been like a wave of the sea, driven by wind
and tossed,

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> for let not that man suppose that he shall
receive anything from the Lord --

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> a two-souled man \[is\] unstable in all his
ways.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> And let the brother who is low rejoice in
his exaltation,

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> and the rich in his becoming low, because
as a flower of grass he shall pass away;

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> for the sun did rise with the burning
heat, and did wither the grass, and the flower of it fell, and the grace
of its appearance did perish, so also the rich in his way shall fade
away!

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Happy the man who doth endure temptation,
because, becoming approved, he shall receive the crown of the life,
which the Lord did promise to those loving Him.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Let no one say, being tempted -- \`From
God I am tempted,' for God is not tempted of evil, and Himself doth
tempt no one,

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> and each one is tempted, by his own
desires being led away and enticed,

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> afterward the desire having conceived,
doth give birth to sin, and the sin having been perfected, doth bring
forth death.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> Be not led astray, my brethren beloved;

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> every good giving, and every perfect gift
is from above, coming down from the Father of the lights, with whom is
no variation, or shadow of turning;

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> having counselled, He did beget us with a
word of truth, for our being a certain first-fruit of His creatures.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> So then, my brethren beloved, let every
man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger,

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> for the wrath of a man the righteousness
of God doth not work;

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> wherefore having put aside all filthiness
and superabundance of evil, in meekness be receiving the engrafted word,
that is able to save your souls;

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> and become ye doers of the word, and not
hearers only, deceiving yourselves,

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> because, if any one is a hearer of the
word and not a doer, this one hath been like to a man viewing his
natural face in a mirror,

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> for he did view himself, and hath gone
away, and immediately he did forget of what kind he was;

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> and he who did look into the perfect law
-- that of liberty, and did continue there, this one -- not a forgetful
hearer becoming, but a doer of work -- this one shall be happy in his
doing.

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> If any one doth think to be religious
among you, not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his heart, of this one
vain \[is\] the religion;

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> religion pure and undefiled with the God
and Father is this, to look after orphans and widows in their
tribulation -- unspotted to keep himself from the world.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> My brethren, hold not, in respect of
persons, the faith of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ,

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> for if there may come into your synagogue a
man with gold ring, in gay raiment, and there may come in also a poor
man in vile raiment,

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> and ye may look upon him bearing the gay
raiment, and may say to him, \`Thou -- sit thou here well,' and to the
poor man may say, \`Thou -- stand thou there, or, Sit thou here under my
footstool,' --

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> ye did not judge fully in yourselves, and
did become ill-reasoning judges.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Hearken, my brethren beloved, did not God
choose the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the reign
that He promised to those loving Him?

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> and ye did dishonour the poor one; do not
the rich oppress you and themselves draw you to judgment-seats;

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> do they not themselves speak evil of the
good name that was called upon you?

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> If, indeed, royal law ye complete,
according to the Writing, \`Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,'
-- ye do well;

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> and if ye accept persons, sin ye do work,
being convicted by the law as transgressors;

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> for whoever the whole law shall keep, and
shall stumble in one \[point\], he hath become guilty of all;

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> for He who is saying, \`Thou mayest not
commit adultery,' said also, \`Thou mayest do no murder;' and if thou
shalt not commit adultery, and shalt commit murder, thou hast become a
transgressor of law;

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> so speak ye and so do, as about by a law
of liberty to be judged,

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> for the judgment without kindness \[is\]
to him not having done kindness, and exult doth kindness over judgment.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> What \[is\] the profit, my brethren, if
faith, any one may speak of having, and works he may not have? is that
faith able to save him?

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> and if a brother or sister may be naked,
and may be destitute of the daily food,

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> and any one of you may say to them,
\`Depart ye in peace, be warmed, and be filled,' and may not give to
them the things needful for the body, what \[is\] the profit?

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> so also the faith, if it may not have
works, is dead by itself.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> But say may some one, Thou hast faith,
and I have works, shew me thy faith out of thy works, and I will shew
thee out of my works my faith:

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> thou -- thou dost believe that God is
one; thou dost well, and the demons believe, and they shudder!

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> And dost thou wish to know, O vain man,
that the faith apart from the works is dead?

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> Abraham our father -- was not he declared
righteous out of works, having brought up Isaac his son upon the altar?

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> dost thou see that the faith was working
with his works, and out of the works the faith was perfected?

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> and fulfilled was the Writing that is
saying, \`And Abraham did believe God, and it was reckoned to him -- to
righteousness;' and, \`Friend of God' he was called.

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> Ye see, then, that out of works is man
declared righteous, and not out of faith only;

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> and in like manner also Rahab the harlot
-- was she not out of works declared righteous, having received the
messengers, and by another way having sent forth?

<span id="an_2:26">2:26</span> for as the body apart from the spirit is
dead, so also the faith apart from the works is dead.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Many teachers become not, my brethren,
having known that greater judgment we shall receive,

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> for we all make many stumbles; if any one
in word doth not stumble, this one \[is\] a perfect man, able to bridle
also the whole body;

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> lo, the bits we put into the mouths of the
horses for their obeying us, and their whole body we turn about;

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> lo, also the ships, being so great, and by
fierce winds being driven, are led about by a very small helm,
whithersoever the impulse of the helmsman doth counsel,

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> so also the tongue is a little member, and
doth boast greatly; lo, a little fire how much wood it doth kindle!

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> and the tongue \[is\] a fire, the world of
the unrighteousness, so the tongue is set in our members, which is
spotting our whole body, and is setting on fire the course of nature,
and is set on fire by the gehenna.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> For every nature, both of beasts and of
fowls, both of creeping things and things of the sea, is subdued, and
hath been subdued, by the human nature,

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> and the tongue no one of men is able to
subdue, \[it is\] an unruly evil, full of deadly poison,

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> with it we do bless the God and Father, and
with it we do curse the men made according to the similitude of God;

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> out of the same mouth doth come forth
blessing and cursing; it doth not need, my brethren, these things so to
happen;

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> doth the fountain out of the same opening
pour forth the sweet and the bitter?

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> is a fig-tree able, my brethren, olives
to make? or a vine figs? so no fountain salt and sweet water \[is able\]
to make.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Who \[is\] wise and intelligent among
you? let him shew out of the good behaviour his works in meekness of
wisdom,

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> and if bitter zeal ye have, and rivalry
in your heart, glory not, nor lie against the truth;

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> this wisdom is not descending from above,
but earthly, physical, demon-like,

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> for where zeal and rivalry \[are\], there
is insurrection and every evil matter;

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> and the wisdom from above, first, indeed,
is pure, then peaceable, gentle, easily entreated, full of kindness and
good fruits, uncontentious, and unhypocritical: --

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> and the fruit of the righteousness in
peace is sown to those making peace.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Whence \[are\] wars and fightings among
you? not thence -- out of your passions, that are as soldiers in your
members?

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> ye desire, and ye have not; ye murder, and
are zealous, and are not able to attain; ye fight and war, and ye have
not, because of your not asking;

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> ye ask, and ye receive not, because evilly
ye ask, that in your pleasures ye may spend \[it\].

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> Adulterers and adulteresses! have ye not
known that friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever, then,
may counsel to be a friend of the world, an enemy of God he is set.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Do ye think that emptily the Writing saith,
\`To envy earnestly desireth the spirit that did dwell in us,'

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> and greater grace he doth give, wherefore
he saith, \`God against proud ones doth set Himself up, and to lowly
ones He doth give grace?'

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> be subject, then, to God; stand up against
the devil, and he will flee from you;

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to
you; cleanse hands, ye sinners! and purify hearts, ye two-souled!

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> be exceeding afflicted, and mourn, and
weep, let your laughter to mourning be turned, and the joy to heaviness;

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> be made low before the Lord, and He shall
exalt you.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> Speak not one against another, brethren;
he who is speaking against a brother, and is judging his brother, doth
speak against law, and doth judge law, and if law thou dost judge, thou
art not a doer of law but a judge;

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> one is the lawgiver, who is able to save
and to destroy; thou -- who art thou that dost judge the other?

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> Go, now, ye who are saying, \`To-day and
to-morrow we will go on to such a city, and will pass there one year,
and traffic, and make gain;'

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> who do not know the thing of the morrow;
for what is your life? for it is a vapour that is appearing for a
little, and then is vanishing;

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> instead of your saying, \`If the Lord may
will, we shall live, and do this or that;'

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> and now ye glory in your pride; all such
glorying is evil;

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> to him, then, knowing to do good, and not
doing, sin it is to him.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Go, now, ye rich! weep, howling over your
miseries that are coming upon \[you\];

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> your riches have rotted, and your garments
have become moth-eaten;

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> your gold and silver have rotted, and the
rust of them for a testimony shall be to you, and shall eat your flesh
as fire. Ye made treasure in the last days!

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> lo, the reward of the workmen, of those who
in-gathered your fields, which hath been fraudulently kept back by you
-- doth cry out, and the exclamations of those who did reap into the
ears of the Lord of Sabaoth have entered;

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> ye did live in luxury upon the earth, and
were wanton; ye did nourish your hearts, as in a day of slaughter;

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> ye did condemn -- ye did murder the
righteous one, he doth not resist you.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> Be patient, then, brethren, till the
presence of the Lord; lo, the husbandman doth expect the precious fruit
of the earth, being patient for it, till he may receive rain -- early
and latter;

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> be patient, ye also; establish your hearts,
because the presence of the Lord hath drawn nigh;

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> murmur not against one another, brethren,
that ye may not be condemned; lo, the Judge before the door hath stood.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> An example take ye of the suffering of
evil, my brethren, and of the patience, the prophets who did speak in
the name of the Lord;

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> lo, we call happy those who are enduring;
the endurance of Job ye heard of, and the end of the Lord ye have seen,
that very compassionate is the Lord, and pitying.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> And before all things, my brethren, do
not swear, neither by the heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any
other oath, and let your Yes be Yes, and the No, No; that under judgment
ye may not fall.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> Doth any one suffer evil among you? let
him pray; is any of good cheer? let him sing psalms;

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> is any infirm among you? let him call for
the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, having anointed
him with oil, in the name of the Lord,

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> and the prayer of the faith shall save
the distressed one, and the Lord shall raise him up, and if sins he may
have committed, they shall be forgiven to him.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> Be confessing to one another the
trespasses, and be praying for one another, that ye may be healed; very
strong is a working supplication of a righteous man;

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> Elijah was a man like affected as we, and
with prayer he did pray -- not to rain, and it did not rain upon the
land three years and six months;

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> and again he did pray, and the heaven did
give rain, and the land did bring forth her fruit.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> Brethren, if any among you may go astray
from the truth, and any one may turn him back,

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> let him know that he who did turn back a
sinner from the straying of his way shall save a soul from death, and
shall cover a multitude of sins.
