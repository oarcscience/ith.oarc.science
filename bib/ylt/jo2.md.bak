### Young's Literal Translation: 2 John

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The Elder to the choice Kyria, and to her
children, whom I love in truth, and not I only, but also all those
having known the truth,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> because of the truth that is remaining in
us, and with us shall be to the age,

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> there shall be with you grace, kindness,
peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of
the Father, in truth and love.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> I rejoiced exceedingly that I have found of
thy children walking in truth, even as a command we did receive from the
Father;

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> and now I beseech thee, Kyria, not as
writing to thee a new command, but which we had from the beginning, that
we may love one another,

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> and this is the love, that we may walk
according to His commands; this is the command, even as ye did hear from
the beginning, that in it ye may walk,

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> because many leading astray did enter into
the world, who are not confessing Jesus Christ coming in flesh; this one
is he who is leading astray, and the antichrist.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> See to yourselves that ye may not lose the
things that we wrought, but a full reward may receive;

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> every one who is transgressing, and is not
remaining in the teaching of the Christ, hath not God; he who is
remaining in the teaching of the Christ, this one hath both the Father
and the Son;

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> if any one doth come unto you, and this
teaching doth not bear, receive him not into the house, and say not to
him, \`Hail!'

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> for he who is saying to him, \`Hail,'
hath fellowship with his evil works.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Many things having to write to you, I did
not intend through paper and ink, but I hope to come unto you, and speak
mouth to mouth, that our joy may be full;

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> salute thee do the children of thy choice
sister. Amen.
