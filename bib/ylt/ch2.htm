<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;And strengthen himself doth Solomon son of David over his  kingdom, and Jehovah his God [is] with him, and maketh him  exceedingly great.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;And Solomon saith to all Israel, to heads of the thousands,  and of the hundreds, and to judges, and to every honourable one  of all Israel, heads of the fathers,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;and they go -- Solomon, and all the assembly with him -- to  the high place that [is] in Gibeon, for there hath been God's  tent of meeting, that Moses, servant of Jehovah, made in the  wilderness,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;but the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath-Jearim,  when David prepared for it, for he stretched out for it a tent  in Jerusalem;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;and the altar of brass that Bezaleel son of Uri, son of Hur  made, he put before the tabernacle of Jehovah; and Solomon and  the assembly seek to it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;And Solomon goeth up thither, on the altar of brass, before  Jehovah, that [is] at the tent of meeting, and causeth to  ascend upon it a thousand burnt-offerings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;In that night hath God appeared to Solomon, and saith to  him, `Ask -- what do I give to thee?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;And Solomon saith to God, `Thou hast done with David my  father great kindness, and hast caused me to reign in his  stead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;Now, O Jehovah God, is Thy word with David my father  stedfast, for Thou hast caused me to reign over a people  numerous as the dust of the earth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;now, wisdom and knowledge give to me, and I go out before  this people, and I come in, for who doth judge this Thy great  people?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;And God saith to Solomon, `Because that this hath been with  thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, and honour,  and the life of those hating thee, and also many days hast not  asked, and dost ask for thyself wisdom and knowledge, so that  thou dost judge My people over which I have caused thee to  reign --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;the wisdom and the knowledge is given to thee, and riches  and wealth and honour I give to thee, that there hath not been  so to the kings who [are] before thee, and after thee it is not  so.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;And Solomon cometh in [from] the high place that [is] in  Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tent of meeting, and  reigneth over Israel,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;and Solomon gathereth chariots and horsemen, and he hath a  thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand  horsemen, and he placeth them in the cities of the chariots,  and with the king in Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;And the king maketh the silver and the gold in Jerusalem as  stones, and the cedars he made as sycamores that [are] in the  low country, for abundance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;And the source of the horses that [are] to Solomon [is] from  Egypt and from Keva; merchants of the king from Keva take at a  price,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;and they come up, and bring out from Egypt a chariot for  six hundred silverlings, and a horse for fifty and a hundred,  and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Aram  -- by their hand they bring out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;And Solomon saith to build a house for the name of Jehovah,  and a house for his kingdom,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;and Solomon numbereth seventy thousand men bearing burden,  and eighty thousand men hewing in the mountain, and overseers  over them -- three thousand and six hundred.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;And Solomon sendeth unto Huram king of Tyre, saying, `When  thou hast dealt with David my father, then thou dost send to  him cedars to build for him a house to dwell in;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;lo, I am building a house to the name of Jehovah my God, to  sanctify [it] to Him, to make perfume before Him, perfume of  spices, and a continual arrangement, and burnt-offerings at  morning and at evening, at sabbaths, and at new moons, and at  appointed seasons of Jehovah our God; to the age this [is] on  Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;`And the house that I am building [is] great, for greater  [is] our God than all gods;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;and who doth retain strength to build to Him a house, for  the heavens, even the heavens of the heavens, do not contain  Him? and who [am] I that I do build to Him a house, except to  make perfume before Him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;`And now, send to me a wise man to work in gold, and in  silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson,  and blue, and knowing to grave gravings with the wise men who  [are] with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father  prepared;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;and send to me cedar-trees, firs, and algums from Lebanon,  for I have known that thy servants know to cut down trees of  Lebanon, and lo, my servants [are] with thy servants,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;even to prepare for me trees in abundance, for the house  that I am building [is] great and wonderful.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;`And lo, to hewers, to those cutting the trees, I have  given beaten wheat to thy servants, cors twenty thousand, and  barley, cors twenty thousand, and wine, baths twenty thousand,  and oil, baths twenty thousand.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;And Huram king of Tyre saith in writing, and sendeth unto  Solomon: `In the love of Jehovah to His people He hath given  thee king over them.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;And Huram saith, `Blessed [is] Jehovah, God of Israel, who  made the heavens and the earth, who hath given to David the  king a wise son, knowing wisdom and understanding, who doth  build a house for Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;`And now, I have sent a wise man having understanding, of  Huram my father,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;(son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father a  man of Tyre), knowing to work in gold, and in silver, in brass,  in iron, in stones, and in wood, in purple, in blue, and in  fine linen, and in crimson, and to grave any graving, and to  devise any device that is given to him, with thy wise men, and  the wise men of my lord David thy father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;`And, now, the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the  wine, as my lord said, let him send to his servants,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;and we -- we cut trees out of Lebanon, according to all thy  need, and bring them in to thee -- floats by sea, to Joppa, and  thou dost take them up to Jerusalem.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;And Solomon numbereth all the men, the sojourners who [are]  in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his  father numbered them, and they are found a hundred and fifty  thousand, and three thousand, and six hundred;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;and he maketh of them seventy thousand burden-bearers, and  eighty thousand hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and  six hundred overseers, to cause the people to work.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;And Solomon beginneth to build the house of Jehovah, in  Jerusalem, in the mount of Moriah, where He appeared to David  his father, in the place that David had prepared, in the  threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;and he beginneth to build in the second [day], in the second  month, in the fourth year of his reign.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;And [in] these hath Solomon been instructed to build the  house of God: The length [in] cubits by the former measure [is]  sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;As to the porch that [is] on the front, the length [is] by  the front of the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the  height a hundred and twenty, and he overlayeth it within with  pure gold.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;And the large house he hath covered with fir-trees, and he  doth cover it with good gold, and causeth to ascend on it palms  and chains,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;and he overlayeth the house with precious stone for beauty,  and the gold [is] gold of Parvaim,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;and he covereth the house, the beams, the thresholds, and  its walls, and its doors, with gold, and hath graved cherubs on  the walls.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;And he maketh the most holy house: its length [is] by the  front of the breadth of the house twenty cubits, and its  breadth twenty cubits, and he covereth it with good gold, to  six hundred talents;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;and the weight of the nails [is] fifty shekels of gold, and  the upper chambers he hath covered with gold.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;And he maketh in the most holy house two cherubs, image  work, and he overlayeth them with gold;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;as to the wings of the cherubs, their length [is] twenty  cubits, the wing of the one [is] five cubits, touching the wall  of the house, and the other wing [is] five cubits, touching the  wing of the other cherub.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;And the wing of the other cherub [is] five cubits touching  the wall of the house, and the other wing [is] five cubits,  adhering to the wing of the other cherub.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;The wings of these cherubs are spreading forth twenty  cubits, and they are standing on their feet and their faces  [are] inward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;And he maketh the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson,  and fine linen, and causeth cherubs to go up on it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;And he maketh at the front of the house two pillars, thirty  and five cubits in length, and the ornament that [is] on their  heads five cubits.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;And he maketh chains in the oracle, and putteth on the  heads of the pillars, and maketh a hundred pomegranates, and  putteth on the chains.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;And he raiseth up the pillars on the front of the temple,  one on the right, and one on the left, and calleth the name of  that on the right Jachin, and the name of that on the left  Boaz.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;And he maketh an altar of brass, twenty cubits its length,  and twenty cubits its breadth, and ten cubits its height.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;And he maketh the molten sea; ten by the cubit, from its  edge unto its edge, round in compass, and five by the cubit its  height, and a line of thirty by the cubit doth compass it,  round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;And the likeness of oxen [is] under it, all round about  encompassing it, ten in the cubit, compassing the sea round  about; two rows of oxen are cast in its being cast.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;It is standing on twelve oxen, three facing the north, and  three facing the west, and three facing the south, and three  facing the east, and the sea [is] upon them above, and all  their hinder parts [are] within.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;And its thickness [is] a handbreadth, and its lip as the  work of the lip of a cup flowered with lilies; taking hold --  baths three thousand it containeth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;And he maketh ten lavers, and putteth five on the right, and  five on the left, to wash with them; the work of the  burnt-offering they purge with them; and the sea [is] for  priests to wash with.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;And he maketh the ten candlesticks of gold, according to  their ordinance, and placeth in the temple, five on the right,  and five on the left.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;And he maketh ten tables, and placeth in the temple, five on  the right, and five on the left; and he maketh bowls of gold a  hundred.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;And he maketh the court of the priests, and the great court,  and doors for the court, and their doors he hath overlaid with  brass.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;And the sea he hath placed on the right shoulder eastward,  over-against the south.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;And Huram maketh the pots, and the shovels, and the bowls,  and Huram finisheth to make the work that he made for king  Solomon in the house of God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;two pillars, and the bowls, and the crowns on the heads of  the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two bowls of  the crowns that [are] on the heads of the pillars;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;and the pomegranates four hundred to the two wreaths, two  rows of pomegranates to the one wreath, to cover the two bowls  of the crowns that [are] on the front of the pillars.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;And the bases he hath made; and the lavers he hath made on  the bases;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;the one sea, and the twelve oxen under it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;and the pots, and the shovels, and the forks, and all their  vessels, hath Huram his father made for king Solomon, for the  house of Jehovah, of brass purified.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;In the circuit of the Jordan hath the king cast them, in  the thick soil of the ground, between Succoth and Zeredathah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;And Solomon maketh all these vessels in great abundance,  that the weight of the brass hath not been searched out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;And Solomon maketh all the vessels that [are for] the house  of God, and the altar of gold, and the tables, and on them [is]  bread of the presence;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;and the candlesticks, and their lamps, for their burning  according to the ordinance, before the oracle, of gold refined;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold -- it  [is] the perfection of gold;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and the  censers, of gold refined, and the opening of the house, its  innermost doors to the holy of holies, and the doors of the  house to the temple, of gold.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;And all the work that Solomon made for the house of Jehovah  is finished, and Solomon bringeth in the sanctified things of  David his father, and the silver, and the gold, and all the  vessels he hath put among the treasures of the house of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;Then doth Solomon assemble the elders of Israel, and all the  heads of the tribes, princes of the fathers of the sons of  Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of  Jehovah from the city of David -- it [is] Zion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;And assembled unto the king are all the men of Israel in the  feast -- it [is] the seventh month;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;and all the elders of Israel come in, and the Levites lift  up the ark,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;and they bring up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all  the vessels of the sanctuary that [are] in the tent; brought  them up have the priests, the Levites;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;and king Solomon and all the company of Israel who are  convened unto him before the ark are sacrificing sheep and  oxen, that are not counted nor numbered from multitude.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;And the priests bring in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah  unto its place, unto the oracle of the house, unto the holy of  holies, unto the place of the wings of the cherubs;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;and the cherubs are spreading out wings over the place of  the ark, and the cherubs cover over the ark, and over its  staves, from above;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;and they lengthen the staves, and the heads of the staves  are seen out of the ark on the front of the oracle, and they  are not seen without; and it is there unto this day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;There is nothing in the ark but the two tables that Moses  gave in Horeb, where Jehovah covenanted with the sons of  Israel, in their going out from Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, in the going out of the priests from  the sanctuary -- for all the priests who are present have  sanctified themselves, there is none to watch by courses,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;and the Levites, the singers, to all of them, to Asaph, to  Heman, to Jeduthun, and to their sons, and to their brethren,  clothed in white linen, with cymbals, and with psalteries, and  harps, are standing on the east of the altar, and with them  priests, to a hundred and twenty, blowing with trumpets --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;yea, it cometh to pass, as one [are] trumpeters and  singers, to sound -- one voice -- to praise and to give thanks  to Jehovah, and at the lifting up of the sound with trumpets,  and with cymbals, and with instruments of song, and at giving  praise to Jehovah, for good, for to the age [is] His kindness,  that the house is filled with a cloud -- the house of Jehovah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;and the priests have not been able to stand to minister  from the presence of the cloud, for the honour of Jehovah hath  filled the house of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;Then said Solomon, `Jehovah said -- to dwell in thick  darkness,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;and I -- I have built a house of habitation for Thee, and a  fixed place for Thy dwelling to the ages.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;And the king turneth round his face, and blesseth the whole  assembly of Israel, and the whole assembly of Israel is  standing,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;and he saith, `Blessed [is] Jehovah, God of Israel, who hath  spoken with His mouth with David my father, and with His hands  hath fulfilled [it], saying:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;`From the day that I brought out My people from the land of  Egypt, I have not fixed on a city out of any of the tribes of  Israel to build a house for my name being there, and I have not  fixed on a man to be leader over My people Israel;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;and I fix on Jerusalem for My name being there, and I fix on  David to be over My people Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;`And it is with the heart of David my father to build a  house for the name of Jehovah God of Israel,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;and Jehovah saith unto David my father, Because that it hath  been with thy heart to build a house for My name, thou hast  done well that it hath been with thy heart,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;but thou dost not build the house, for thy son who cometh  forth out from thy loins, he doth build the house for My name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;`And Jehovah doth establish His word that He spake, and I  rise up in the stead of David my father, and sit on the throne  of Israel, as Jehovah spake, and I build the house for the name  of Jehovah, God of Israel,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;and I place there the ark, where [is] the covenant of  Jehovah that He made with the sons of Israel.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;And he standeth before the altar of Jehovah, over-against  all the assembly of Israel, and spreadeth out his hand, --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;for Solomon hath made a scaffold of brass, and putteth it  in the midst of the court, five cubits its length, and five  cubits its breadth, and three cubits its height, and he  standeth upon it, and kneeleth on his knees over-against all  the assembly of Israel, and spreadeth forth his hands towards  the heavens --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;and saith, `O Jehovah God of Israel, there is not like Thee  a god in the heavens and in the earth, keeping the covenant and  the kindness for Thy servants who are walking before Thee with  all their heart;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:15">6:15</A>&nbsp;who hast kept for Thy servant David my father that which  Thou didst speak to him; yea, Thou dost speak with Thy mouth,  and with Thy hand hast fulfilled [it], as at this day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:16">6:16</A>&nbsp;`And now, O Jehovah, God of Israel, keep for Thy servant  David my father that which Thou didst speak to him, saying,  There is not cut off to thee a man from before Me, sitting on  the throne of Israel, only, if thy sons watch their way to walk  in My law, as thou hast walked before Me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:17">6:17</A>&nbsp;`And now, O Jehovah, God of Israel, is Thy word stedfast  that Thou hast spoken to Thy servant, to David,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:18">6:18</A>&nbsp;(for is it true? -- God dwelleth with man on the earth! Lo,  the heavens, and the heavens of the heavens, do not contain  Thee, how much less this house that I have built?)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:19">6:19</A>&nbsp;`And Thou hast turned unto the prayer of Thy servant, and  unto his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken unto the  cry and unto the prayer that Thy servant is praying before  Thee,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:20">6:20</A>&nbsp;for Thine eyes being open towards this house by day and by  night, towards the place that Thou hast said to put Thy name  there, to hearken unto the prayer that Thy servant prayeth  towards this place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:21">6:21</A>&nbsp;`And Thou hast hearkened unto the supplications of Thy  servant, and of Thy people Israel, that they pray towards this  place, and Thou dost hear from the place of Thy dwelling, from  the heavens, and hast hearkened, and forgiven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:22">6:22</A>&nbsp;`If a man doth sin against his neighbour, and he hath  lifted up on him an oath to cause him to swear, and the oath  hath come in before Thine altar in this house --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:23">6:23</A>&nbsp;then Thou dost hear from the heavens, and hast done, and  hast judged Thy servants, to give back to the wicked, to put  his way on his head, and to declare righteous the righteous, to  give to him according to his righteousness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:24">6:24</A>&nbsp;`And if Thy people Israel is smitten before an enemy,  because they sin against Thee, and they have turned back and  confessed Thy name, and prayed and made supplication before  Thee in this house --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:25">6:25</A>&nbsp;then Thou dost hear from the heavens, and hast forgiven the  sin of Thy people Israel, and caused them to turn back unto the  ground that Thou hast given to them, and to their fathers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:26">6:26</A>&nbsp;`In the heavens being restrained, and there is no rain,  because they sin against Thee, and they have prayed towards  this place, and confessed Thy name -- from their sin they turn  back because Thou dost afflict them --</p>

<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;And all the sons of Israel are looking on the descending of  the fire, and the honour of Jehovah on the house, and they bow  -- faces to the earth -- on the pavement, and do obeisance, and  give thanks to Jehovah, for good, for to the age [is] His  kindness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;And the king and all the people are sacrificing a  sacrifice before Jehovah,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;And Solomon sanctifieth the middle of the court that [is]  before the house of Jehovah, for he hath made there the  burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings: for the  altar of brass that Solomon made hath not been able to contain  the burnt-offering, and the present, and the fat.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;And solomon maketh the feast at that time seven days, and  all Israel with him -- a very great assembly -- from the  entering in of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;And they make on the eighth day a restraint, because the  dedication of the altar they have made seven days, and the  feast seven days.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_7:20">7:20</A>&nbsp;and this house that I have sanctified for My name, I cast  from before My face, and make it for a proverb, and for a  byword, among all the peoples.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, at the end of twenty years, that  Solomon hath built the house of Jehovah, and his own house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;As to the cities that Huram hath given to Solomon, Solomon  hath built them, and there he causeth the sons of Israel to  dwell.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;And Solomon goeth to Hamath-Zobah, and layeth hold upon  it;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;and he buildeth Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the cities  of store that he hath built in Hamath.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;And he buildeth Beth-Horon the upper, and Beth-Horon the  lower -- cities of defence, with walls, two-leaved doors, and  bar --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;and Baalath, and all the cities of store that Solomon had,  and all the cities of the chariot, and the cities of the  horsemen, and all the desire of Solomon that he desired to  build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his  dominion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;All the people who are left of the Hittite, and the Amorite,  and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, who are  not of Israel --</p>

<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;And none of the sons of Israel hath Solomon made servants  for his work, but they [are] men of war, and heads of his  captains, and heads of his charioteers, and of his horsemen;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;and these [are] heads of the officers whom king Solomon  hath, two hundred and fifty who are rulers among the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;And the daughter of Pharaoh hath Solomon brought up from  the city of David to the house that he built for her, for he  said, `My wife doth not dwell in the house of David king of  Israel, for they are holy unto whom hath come the ark of  Jehovah.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;Then hath Solomon caused to ascend burnt-offerings to  Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah that he built before the porch,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;even by the matter of a day in its day, to cause to ascend  according to the command of Moses, on sabbaths, and on new  moons, and on appointed seasons, three times in a year -- in  the feast of unleavened things, and in the feast of weeks, and  in the feast of booths.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;And he establisheth, according to the ordinance of David  his father, the courses of the priests over their service, and  of the Levites over their charges, to praise and to minister  over-against the priests, according to the matter of a day in  its day, and the gatekeepers in their courses at gate and gate,  for so [is] the command of David the man of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:15">8:15</A>&nbsp;And they have not turned aside [from] the command of the  king concerning the priests and the Levites, in reference to  any matter, and to the treasures.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:16">8:16</A>&nbsp;And all the work of Solomon is prepared till the day of the  foundation of the house of Jehovah, and till its completion;  perfect is the house of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:17">8:17</A>&nbsp;Then hath Solomon gone to Ezion-Geber, and unto Elath, on  the border of the sea, in the land of Edom;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:18">8:18</A>&nbsp;and Huram sendeth to him, by the hand of his servants,  ships and servants knowing the sea, and they go with servants  of Solomon to Ophir, and take thence four hundred and fifty  talents of gold, and bring in unto king Solomon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;And the queen of Sheba hath heard of the fame of Solomon,  and cometh in to try Solomon with acute sayings, to Jerusalem,  with a very great company, and camels bearing spices and gold  in abundance, and precious stone; and she cometh in unto  Solomon, and speaketh with him all that hath been with her  heart,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;and Solomon declareth to her all her matters, and there hath  not been hid a thing from Solomon that he hath not declared to  her.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;And she saith unto the king, `True [is] the word that I  heard in my land concerning thy matters and concerning thy  wisdom,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;and I have given no credence to their words, till that I  have come, and mine eyes see, and lo, there hath not been  declared to me the half of the abundance of thy wisdom -- thou  hast added unto the report that I heard.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;And she giveth to the king a hundred and twenty talents of  gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stone; and  there hath not been any such spice as the queen of Sheba hath  given to king Solomon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;And also, servants of Huram, and servants of Solomon, who  brought in gold from Ophir, have brought in algum-trees and  precious stone.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;And the king maketh the algum-trees staircases for the  house of Jehovah, and for the house of the king, and harps and  psalteries for singers; and there have been none seen like  these before in the land of Judah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;And king Solomon hath given to the queen of Sheba all her  desire that she asked, apart from that which she had brought  unto the king, and she turneth and goeth to her land, she and  her servants.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;And the weight of the gold that is coming to Solomon in one  year is six hundred and sixty and six talents of gold,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;apart from [what] the tourists, and the merchants, are  bringing in; and all the kings of Arabia, and the governors of  the land, are bringing in gold and silver to Solomon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;And king Solomon maketh two hundred targets of alloyed  gold, six hundred [shekels] of alloyed gold he causeth to go up  on the one target;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_30:16">30:16</A>&nbsp;And they stand on their station according to their  ordinance; according to the law of Moses the man of God the  priests are sprinkling the blood out of the hand of the  Levites,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_31:20">31:20</A>&nbsp;And Hezekiah doth thus in all Judah, and doth that which  is good, and that which is right, and that which is true,  before Jehovah his God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:21">31:21</A>&nbsp;and in every work that he hath begun for the service of  the house of God, and for the law, and for the command, to seek  to his God, with all his heart he hath wrought and prospered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:1">32:1</A>&nbsp;After these things and this truth, come hath Sennacherib  king of Asshur, yea, he cometh in to Judah, and encampeth  against the cities of the bulwarks, and saith to rend them unto  himself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:2">32:2</A>&nbsp;And Hezekiah seeth that Sennacherib hath come, and his face  [is] to the battle against Jerusalem,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:3">32:3</A>&nbsp;and he taketh counsel with his heads and his mighty ones,  to stop the waters of the fountains that [are] at the outside  of the city -- and they help him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:4">32:4</A>&nbsp;and much people are gathered, and they stop all the  fountains and the brook that is rushing into the midst of the  land, saying, `Why do the kings of Asshur come, and have found  much water?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:5">32:5</A>&nbsp;And he strengtheneth himself, and buildeth the whole of the  wall that is broken, and causeth [it] to ascend unto the  towers, and at the outside of the wall another, and  strengtheneth Millo, [in] the city of David, and maketh darts  in abundance, and shields.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:6">32:6</A>&nbsp;And he putteth heads of war over the people, and gathereth  them unto him, unto the broad place of a gate of the city, and  speaketh unto their heart, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:7">32:7</A>&nbsp;`Be strong and courageous, be not afraid, nor be cast down  from the face of the king of Asshur, and from the face of all  the multitude that [is] with him, for with us [are] more than  with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:8">32:8</A>&nbsp;With him [is] an arm of flesh, and with us [is] Jehovah our  God, to help us, and to fight our battles;' and the people are  supported by the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:9">32:9</A>&nbsp;After this hath Sennacherib king of Asshur sent his  servants to Jerusalem -- and he [is] by Lachish, and all his  power with him -- against Hezekiah king of Judah, and against  all Judah, who [are] in Jerusalem, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:10">32:10</A>&nbsp;`Thus said Sennacherib king of Asshur, On what are ye  trusting and abiding in the bulwark, in Jerusalem?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:11">32:11</A>&nbsp;`Is not Hezekiah persuading you, to give you up to die by  famine, and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God doth deliver us  from the hand of the king of Asshur?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:12">32:12</A>&nbsp;Hath not Hezekiah himself turned aside His high places,  and His altars, and speaketh to Judah and to Jerusalem, saying,  Before one altar ye bow yourselves, and on it ye make perfume?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:13">32:13</A>&nbsp;`Do ye not know what I have done -- I and my fathers -- to  all peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the  lands at all able to deliver their land out of my hand?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:14">32:14</A>&nbsp;Who among all the gods of these nations whom my fathers  have devoted to destruction [is] he who hath been able to  deliver his people out of my hand, that your God is able to  deliver you out of my hand?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:15">32:15</A>&nbsp;`And, now, let not Hezekiah lift you up, nor persuade you  thus, nor give credence to him, for no god of any nation and  kingdom is able to deliver his people from my hand, and from  the hand of my fathers: also, surely your God doth not deliver  you from my hand!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:16">32:16</A>&nbsp;And again have his servants spoken against Jehovah God,  and against Hezekiah His servant,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:17">32:17</A>&nbsp;and letters he hath written to give reproach to Jehovah,  God of Israel, and to speak against Him, saying, `As the gods  of the nations of the lands that have not delivered their  people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah doth not deliver  His people from my hand.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:18">32:18</A>&nbsp;And they call with a great voice [in] Jewish, against  the people of Jerusalem who [are] on the wall, to frighten  them, and to trouble them, that they may capture the city,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:19">32:19</A>&nbsp;and they speak against the God of Jerusalem as against the  gods of the peoples of the land -- work of the hands of man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:20">32:20</A>&nbsp;And Hezekiah the king prayeth, and Isaiah son of Amoz the  prophet, concerning this, and they cry to the heavens,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:21">32:21</A>&nbsp;and Jehovah sendeth a messenger, and cutteth off every  mighty one of valour -- both leader and head -- in the camp of  the king of Asshur, and he turneth back with shame of face to  his land, and entereth the house of his god, and those coming  out of his bowels have caused him to fall there by the sword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:22">32:22</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah saveth Hezekiah and the inhabitants of  Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Asshur, and from  the hand of all, and He leadeth them round about;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:23">32:23</A>&nbsp;and many are bringing in an offering to Jehovah, to  Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah, and  he is lifted up before the eyes of all the nations after this.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:24">32:24</A>&nbsp;In those days hath Hezekiah been sick even unto death, and  he prayeth unto Jehovah, and He speaketh to him, and a wonder  hath appointed for him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:25">32:25</A>&nbsp;and Hezekiah hath not returned according to the deed  [done] unto him, for his heart hath been lofty, and there is  wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:26">32:26</A>&nbsp;and Hezekiah is humbled for the loftiness of his heart, he  and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the wrath of Jehovah hath  not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:27">32:27</A>&nbsp;And Hezekiah hath riches and honour very much, and  treasures he hath made to himself of silver, and of gold, and  of precious stone, and of spices, and of shields, and of all  [kinds] of desirable vessels,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:28">32:28</A>&nbsp;and storehouses for the increase of corn, and new wine,  and oil, and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and herds for  stalls;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:29">32:29</A>&nbsp;and cities he hath made for himself, and possessions of  flocks and herds in abundance, for God hath given to him very  much substance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:30">32:30</A>&nbsp;And Hezekiah himself hath stopped the upper source of the  waters of Gihon, and directeth them beneath to the west of the  city of David, and Hezekiah prospereth in all his work;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:31">32:31</A>&nbsp;and so with the ambassadors of the heads of Babylon, those  sending unto him to inquire of the wonder that hath been in the  land, God hath left him to try him, to know all in his heart,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:32">32:32</A>&nbsp;And the rest of the matters of Hezekiah, and his kind  acts, lo, they are written in the vision of Isaiah son of Amoz  the prophet, on the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:33">32:33</A>&nbsp;And Hezekiah lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in  the uppermost of the graves of the sons of David, and all Judah  and the inhabitants of Jerusalem have done honour to him at his  death, and reign doth Manasseh his son in his stead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:1">33:1</A>&nbsp;A son of twelve years is Manasseh in his reigning, and  fifty and five years he hath reigned in Jerusalem;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:2">33:2</A>&nbsp;and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, like the  abominations of the nations that Jehovah dispossessed from the  presence of the sons of Israel,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:3">33:3</A>&nbsp;and he turneth and buildeth the high places that Hezekiah  his father hath broken down, and raiseth altars for Baalim, and  maketh shrines, and boweth himself to all the host of the  heavens, and serveth them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:4">33:4</A>&nbsp;And he hath built altars in the house of Jehovah of which  Jehovah had said, `In Jerusalem is My name to the age.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:5">33:5</A>&nbsp;And he buildeth altars to all the host of the heavens in  the two courts of the house of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:6">33:6</A>&nbsp;And he hath caused his sons to pass over through fire in  the valley of the son of Hinnom, and observed clouds and used  enchantments and witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit,  and a wizard; he hath multiplied to do the evil thing in the  eyes of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:7">33:7</A>&nbsp;And he placeth the graven image of the idol that he made in  the house of God, of which God said unto David, and unto  Solomon his son, `In this house, and in Jerusalem that I have  chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I put My name to the  age,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:8">33:8</A>&nbsp;and I add not to turn aside the foot of Israel from off the  ground that I appointed to your fathers, only, if they watch to  do all that I have commanded them -- to all the law, and the  statutes, and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:9">33:9</A>&nbsp;And Manasseh maketh Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem  to err, to do evil above the nations that Jehovah destroyed  from the presence of the sons of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:10">33:10</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah speaketh unto Manasseh and unto his people,  and they have not attended,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:11">33:11</A>&nbsp;and Jehovah bringeth in against them the heads of the host  that the king of Asshur hath, and they capture Manasseh among  the thickets, and bind him with brazen fetters, and cause him  to go to Babylon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:12">33:12</A>&nbsp;And when he is in distress he hath appeased the face of  Jehovah his God, and is humbled exceedingly before the God of  his fathers,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:13">33:13</A>&nbsp;and prayeth unto Him, and He is entreated of him, and  heareth his supplication, and bringeth him back to Jerusalem,  to his kingdom, and Manasseh knoweth that Jehovah -- He [is]  God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:14">33:14</A>&nbsp;And after this he hath built an outer wall to the city of  David, on the west of Gihon, in the valley, and at the entering  in at the fish-gate, and it hath gone round to the tower, and  he maketh it exceeding high, and he putteth heads of the force  in all the cities of the bulwarks in Judah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:15">33:15</A>&nbsp;And he turneth aside the gods of the stranger, and the  idol, out of the house of Jehovah, and all the altars that he  had built in the mount of the house of Jehovah and in  Jerusalem, and casteth [them] to the outside of the city.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:16">33:16</A>&nbsp;And he buildeth the altar of Jehovah, and sacrificeth upon  it sacrifices of peace-offerings and thank-offering, and saith  to Judah to serve Jehovah, God of Israel;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:17">33:17</A>&nbsp;but still the people are sacrificing in high places, only  -- to Jehovah their God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:18">33:18</A>&nbsp;And the rest of the matters of Manasseh, and his prayer  unto his God, and the matters of the seers, those speaking unto  him in the name of Jehovah, God of Israel, lo, they are [on the  book of] the matters of the kings of Israel;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:19">33:19</A>&nbsp;and his prayer, and his entreaty, and all his sin, and his  trespass, and the places in which he had built high places, and  established the shrines and the graven images before his being  humbled, lo, they are written beside the matters of Hozai.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:20">33:20</A>&nbsp;And Manasseh lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in  his own house, and reign doth Amon his son in his stead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:21">33:21</A>&nbsp;A son of twenty and two years [is] Amon in his reigning,  and two years he hath reigned in Jerusalem,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:22">33:22</A>&nbsp;and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, as did  Manasseh his father, and to all the graven images that Manasseh  his father had made hath Amon sacrificed, and serveth them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:23">33:23</A>&nbsp;and hath not been humbled before Jehovah, like the  humbling of Manasseh his father, for Amon himself hath  multiplied guilt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:24">33:24</A>&nbsp;And his servants conspire against him, and put him to  death in his own house,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:25">33:25</A>&nbsp;and the people of the land smite all those conspiring  against king Amon, and the people of the land cause Josiah his  son to reign in his stead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:1">34:1</A>&nbsp;A son of eight years [is] Josiah in his reigning, and  thirty and one years he hath reigned in Jerusalem,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:2">34:2</A>&nbsp;and he doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah, and  walketh in the ways of David his father, and hath not turned  aside -- right or left.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:3">34:3</A>&nbsp;And in the eighth year of his reign (and he yet a youth),  he hath begun to seek to the God of David his father, and in  the twelfth year he hath begun to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem  from the high places, and the shrines, and the graven images,  and the molten images.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:4">34:4</A>&nbsp;And they break down before him the altars of the Baalim,  and the images that [are] on high above them he hath cut down,  and the shrines, and the graven images, and the molten images,  he hath broken and beaten small, and streweth on the surface of  the graves of those sacrificing to them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:5">34:5</A>&nbsp;and the bones of the priests he hath burnt on their altars,  and cleanseth Judah and Jerusalem,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:6">34:6</A>&nbsp;and in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon,  even unto Naphtali, with their tools, round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:7">34:7</A>&nbsp;And he breaketh down the altars and the shrines, and the  graven images he hath beaten down very small, and all the images  he hath cut down in all the land of Israel, and turneth back to  Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:8">34:8</A>&nbsp;And in the eighteenth year of his reign, to purify the land  and the house he hath sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah  head of the city, and Joah son of Johaz the remembrancer, to  strengthen the house of Jehovah his God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:9">34:9</A>&nbsp;And they come in unto Hilkiah the high priest, and they  give the money that is brought in to the house of God, that the  Levites, keeping the threshold, have gathered from the hand of  Manasseh, and Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, and  from all Judah, and Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:10">34:10</A>&nbsp;and they give [it] into the hand of the workmen, those  appointed over the house of Jehovah, and they give it [to] the  workmen who are working in the house of Jehovah, to repair and  to strengthen the house;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:11">34:11</A>&nbsp;and they give [it] to artificers, and to builders, to buy  hewn stones, and wood for couplings and for beams to the houses  that the kings of Judah had destroyed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:12">34:12</A>&nbsp;And the men are working faithfully in the business, and  over them are appointed Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the  sons of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the  Kohathite, to overlook; and of the Levites, every one  understanding about instruments of song,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_34:18">34:18</A>&nbsp;And Shaphan the scribe declareth to the king, saying, `A  book hath Hilkiah the priest given to me;' and Shaphan readeth  in it before the king.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:19">34:19</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, at the king's hearing the words of  the law, that he rendeth his garments,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:20">34:20</A>&nbsp;and the king commandeth Hilkiah, and Ahikam son of  Shaphan, and Abdon son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and  Asaiah, servant of the king, saying,</p>
