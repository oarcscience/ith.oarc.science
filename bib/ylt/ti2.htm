<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of God,  according to a promise of life that [is] in Christ Jesus,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;to Timotheus, beloved child: Grace, kindness, peace, from  God the Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;I am thankful to God, whom I serve from progenitors in a  pure conscience, that unceasingly I have remembrance  concerning thee in my supplications night and day,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;desiring greatly to see thee, being mindful of thy tears,  that with joy I may be filled,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;taking remembrance of the unfeigned faith that is in thee,  that dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother  Eunice, and I am persuaded that also in thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;For which cause I remind thee to stir up the gift of God  that is in thee through the putting on of my hands,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;for God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power, and  of love, and of a sound mind;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;therefore thou mayest not be ashamed of the testimony of our  Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but do thou suffer evil along  with the good news according to the power of God,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;who did save us, and did call with an holy calling, not  according to our works, but according to His own purpose and  grace, that was given to us in Christ Jesus, before the times  of the ages,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;and was made manifest now through the manifestation of our  Saviour Jesus Christ, who indeed did abolish death, and did  enlighten life and immortality through the good news,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;to which I was placed a preacher and an apostle, and a  teacher of nations,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;for which cause also these things I suffer, but I am not  ashamed, for I have known in whom I have believed, and have  been persuaded that he is able that which I have committed to  him to guard -- to that day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;The pattern hold thou of sound words, which from me thou  didst hear, in faith and love that [is] in Christ Jesus;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;the good thing committed guard thou through the Holy Spirit  that is dwelling in us;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;thou hast known this, that they did turn from me -- all  those in Asia, of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;may the Lord give kindness to the house of Onesiphorus,  because many times he did refresh me, and of my chain was not  ashamed,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;but being in Rome, very diligently he sought me, and found;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;may the Lord give to him to find kindness from the Lord in  that day; and how many things in Ephesus he did minister thou  dost very well know.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;Thou, therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that [is]  in Christ Jesus,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;and the things that thou didst hear from me through many  witnesses, these things be committing to stedfast men, who  shall be sufficient also others to teach;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;thou, therefore, suffer evil as a good soldier of Jesus  Christ;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;no one serving as a soldier did entangle himself with the  affairs of life, that him who did enlist him he may please;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;and if also any one may strive, he is not crowned, except he  may strive lawfully;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;the labouring husbandman it behoveth first of the fruits to  partake;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;be considering what things I say, for the Lord give to thee  understanding in all things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;Remember Jesus Christ, raised out of the dead, of the seed  of David, according to my good news,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;in which I suffer evil -- unto bonds, as an evil-doer, but  the word of God hath not been bound;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;because of this all things do I endure, because of the  choice ones, that they also salvation may obtain that [is] in  Christ Jesus, with glory age-during.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;Stedfast [is] the word: For if we died together -- we also  shall live together;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;if we do endure together -- we shall also reign together;  if we deny [him], he also shall deny us;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;if we are not stedfast, he remaineth stedfast; to deny  himself he is not able.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;These things remind [them] of, testifying fully before the  Lord -- not to strive about words to nothing profitable, but  to the subversion of those hearing;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;be diligent to present thyself approved to God -- a workman  irreproachable, rightly dividing the word of the truth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;and the profane vain talkings stand aloof from, for to more  impiety they will advance,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;and their word as a gangrene will have pasture, of whom is  Hymenaeus and Philetus,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;who concerning the truth did swerve, saying the rising  again to have already been, and do overthrow the faith of  some;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;sure, nevertheless, hath the foundation of God stood,  having this seal, `The Lord hath known those who are His,' and  `Let him depart from unrighteousness -- every one who is  naming the name of Christ.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;And in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and  of silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to honour,  and some to dishonour:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;if, then, any one may cleanse himself from these, he shall  be a vessel to honour, sanctified and profitable to the master  -- to every good work having been prepared,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;and the youthful lusts flee thou, and pursue righteousness,  faith, love, peace, with those calling upon the Lord out of a  pure heart;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:23">2:23</A>&nbsp;and the foolish and uninstructed questions be avoiding,  having known that they beget strife,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:24">2:24</A>&nbsp;and a servant of the Lord it behoveth not to strive, but to  be gentle unto all, apt to teach, patient under evil,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:25">2:25</A>&nbsp;in meekness instructing those opposing -- if perhaps God  may give to them repentance to an acknowledging of the truth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:26">2:26</A>&nbsp;and they may awake out of the devil's snare, having been  caught by him at his will.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;And this know thou, that in the last days there shall come  perilous times,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;for men shall be lovers of themselves, lovers of money,  boasters, proud, evil-speakers, to parents disobedient,  unthankful, unkind,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;without natural affection, implacable, false accusers,  incontinent, fierce, not lovers of those who are good,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;traitors, heady, lofty, lovers of pleasure more than lovers  of God,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;having a form of piety, and its power having denied; and  from these be turning away,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;for of these there are those coming into the houses and  leading captive the silly women, laden with sins, led away  with desires manifold,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;always learning, and never to a knowledge of truth able to  come,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;and, even as Jannes and Jambres stood against Moses, so also  these do stand against the truth, men corrupted in mind,  disapproved concerning the faith;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;but they shall not advance any further, for their folly  shall be manifest to all, as theirs also did become.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;And thou -- thou hast followed after my teaching, manner of  life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, endurance,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;the persecutions, the afflictions, that befel me in  Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured,  and out of all the Lord did deliver me,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;and all also who will to live piously in Christ Jesus shall  be persecuted,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;and evil men and impostors shall advance to the worse,  leading astray and being led astray.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;And thou -- be remaining in the things which thou didst  learn and wast entrusted with, having known from whom thou  didst learn,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;and because from a babe the Holy Writings thou hast known,  which are able to make thee wise -- to salvation, through  faith that [is] in Christ Jesus;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;every Writing [is] God-breathed, and profitable for  teaching, for conviction, for setting aright, for instruction  that [is] in righteousness,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;that the man of God may be fitted -- for every good work  having been completed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;I do fully testify, then, before God, and the Lord Jesus  Christ, who is about to judge living and dead at his  manifestation and his reign --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;preach the word; be earnest in season, out of season,  convict, rebuke, exhort, in all long-suffering and teaching,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;for there shall be a season when the sound teaching they  will not suffer, but according to their own desires to  themselves they shall heap up teachers -- itching in the  hearing,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;and indeed, from the truth the hearing they shall turn away,  and to the fables they shall be turned aside.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;And thou -- watch in all things; suffer evil; do the work of  one proclaiming good news; of thy ministration make full  assurance,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;for I am already being poured out, and the time of my  release hath arrived;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;the good strife I have striven, the course I have finished,  the faith I have kept,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of the  righteousness that the Lord -- the Righteous Judge -- shall  give to me in that day, and not only to me, but also to all  those loving his manifestation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;Be diligent to come unto me quickly,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;for Demas forsook me, having loved the present age, and  went on to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to  Dalmatia,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;Lukas only is with me; Markus having taken, bring with  thyself, for he is profitable to me for ministration;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;and Tychicus I sent to Ephesus;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;the cloak that I left in Troas with Carpus, coming, bring  thou and the books -- especially the parchments.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil; may the Lord  repay to him according to his works,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;of whom also do thou beware, for greatly hath he stood  against our words;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;in my first defence no one stood with me, but all forsook  me, (may it not be reckoned to them!)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;and the Lord stood by me, and did strengthen me, that  through me the preaching might be fully assured, and all the  nations might hear, and I was freed out of the mouth of a lion,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;and the Lord shall free me from every evil work, and shall  save [me] -- to his heavenly kingdom; to whom [is] the glory to  the ages of the ages! Amen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;Salute Prisca and Aquilas, and Onesiphorus' household;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;Erastus did remain in Corinth, and Trophimus I left in  Miletus infirm;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;be diligent to come before winter. Salute thee doth  Eubulus, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the  brethren.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;The Lord Jesus Christ [is] with thy spirit; the grace [is]  with you! Amen. </p>
