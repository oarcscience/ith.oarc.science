<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, after the death of Saul, that David  hath returned from smiting the Amalekite, and David dwelleth in  Ziklag two days,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;and it cometh to pass, on the third day, that lo, a man hath  come in out of the camp from Saul, and his garments [are] rent,  and earth on his head; and it cometh to pass, in his coming in  unto David, that he falleth to the earth, and doth obeisance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;And David saith to him, `Whence comest thou?' and he saith  unto him, `Out of the camp of Israel I have escaped.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;And David saith unto him, `What hath been the matter? declare,  I pray thee, to me.' And he saith, that `The people hath fled  from the battle, and also a multitude hath fallen of the  people, and they die; and also Saul and Jonathan his son have  died.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;And David saith unto the youth who is declaring [it] to him,  `How hast thou known that Saul and Jonathan his son [are]  dead?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;And the youth who is declaring [it] to him saith, I  happened to meet in mount Gilboa, and lo, Saul is leaning on  his spear; and lo, the chariots and those possessing horses  have followed him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;and he turneth behind him, and seeth me, and calleth unto  me, and I say, Here [am] I.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;And he saith to me, Who [art] thou? and I say unto him, An  Amalekite I [am].'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;`And he saith unto me, Stand, I pray thee, over me, and put  me to death, for seized me hath the arrow, for all my soul [is]  still in me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;And I stand over him, and put him to death, for I knew that  he doth not live after his falling, and I take the crown which  [is] on his head, and the bracelet which [is] on his arm, and  bring them in unto my lord hither.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;And David taketh hold on his garments, and rendeth them, and  also all the men who [are] with him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;and they mourn, and weep, and fast till the evening, for  Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah,  and for the house of Israel, because they have fallen by the  sword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;And David saith unto the youth who is declaring [it] to  him, `Whence [art] thou?' and he saith, `Son of a sojourner, an  Amalekite, I [am].'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;And David saith unto him, `How wast thou not afraid to put  forth thy hand to destroy the anointed of Jehovah?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;And David calleth to one of the youths, and saith, `Draw  nigh -- fall upon him;' and he smiteth him, and he dieth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;and David saith unto him, `Thy blood [is] on thine own  head, for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I -- I  put to death the anointed of Jehovah.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;And David lamenteth with this lamentation over Saul, and  over Jonathan his son;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;and he saith to teach the sons of Judah `The Bow;' lo, it  is written on the book of the Upright: --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;`The Roebuck, O Israel, On thy high places [is] wounded;  How have the mighty fallen!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;Declare [it] not in Gath, Proclaim not the tidings in the  streets of Ashkelon, Lest they rejoice -- The daughters of the  Philistines, Lest they exult -- The daughters of the  Uncircumcised!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;Mountains of Gilboa! No dew nor rain be on you, And fields  of heave-offerings! For there hath become loathsome The shield  of the mighty, The shield of Saul -- without the anointed with  oil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;From the blood of the wounded, From the fat of the mighty,  The bow of Jonathan Hath not turned backward; And the sword of  Saul doth not return empty.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;Saul and Jonathan! They are loved and pleasant in their  lives, And in their death they have not been parted. Than  eagles they have been lighter, Than lions they have been  mightier!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;Daughters of Israel! for Saul weep ye, Who is clothing you  [in] scarlet with delights. Who is lifting up ornaments of gold  on your clothing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;How have the mighty fallen In the midst of the battle!  Jonathan! on thy high places wounded!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:26">1:26</A>&nbsp;I am in distress for thee, my brother Jonathan, Very  pleasant wast thou to me; Wonderful was thy love to me, Above  the love of women!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:27">1:27</A>&nbsp;How have the mighty fallen, Yea, the weapons of war  perish!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass afterwards, that David asketh at  Jehovah, saying, `Do I go up into one of the cities of Judah?'  and Jehovah saith unto him, `Go up.' And David saith, `Whither  do I go up?' and He saith, `To Hebron.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;And David goeth up thither, and also his two wives, Ahinoam  the Jezreelitess, and Abigail wife of Nabal the Carmelite;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;and his men who [are] with him hath David brought up -- a man  and his household -- and they dwell in the cities of Hebron.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;And the men of Judah come, and anoint there David for king  over the house of Judah; and they declare to David, saying,  `The men of Jabesh-Gilead [are] they who buried Saul.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;And David sendeth messengers unto the men of Jabesh-Gilead,  and saith unto them, `Blessed [are] ye of Jehovah, in that ye  have done this kindness with your lord, with Saul, that ye bury  him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;`And, now, Jehovah doth with you kindness and truth, and  also, I do with you this good because ye have done this thing;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;and now, are your hands strong, and be ye for sons of  valour, for your lord Saul. [is] dead, and also -- me have the  house of Judah anointed for king over them.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;And Abner, son of Ner, head of the host which Saul hath,  hath taken Ish-Bosheth, son of Saul, and causeth him to pass  over to Mahanaim,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;and causeth him to reign over Gilead, and over the Ashurite,  and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over  Israel -- all of it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;A son of forty years, [is] Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, in his  reigning over Israel, and two years he hath reigned, only the  house of Judah have been after David.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;And the number of the days that David hath been king in  Hebron, over the house of Judah, is seven years and six months.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;And Abner son of Ner goeth out, and servants of Ish-Bosheth  son of Saul, from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;And Joab son of Zeruiah, and servants of David, have gone  out, and they meet by the pool of Gibeon together, and sit  down, these by the pool on this [side], and these by the pool on  that.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;And Abner saith unto Joab, `Let the youths rise, I pray  thee, and they play before us;' and Joab saith, `Let them  rise.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;And they rise and pass over, in number twelve of Benjamin,  even of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of  David.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;And they lay hold, each on the head of his companion, and  his sword [is] in the side of his companion, and they fall  together, and [one] calleth that place Helkath-Hazzurim, which  [is] in Gibeon,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;and the battle is very hard on that day, and Abner is  smitten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;And there are there three sons of Zeruiah, Joab, and  Abishai, and Asahel, and Asahel [is] light on his feet, as one  of the roes which [are] in the field,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;And Asahel pursueth after Abner, and hath not turned aside  to go to the right or to the left, from after Abner.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;And Abner looketh behind him, and saith, `Art thou  he -- Asahel?' and he saith, `I [am].'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;And Abner saith to him, `Turn thee aside to thy right hand  or to thy left, and seize for thee one of the youths, and take  to thee his armour;' and Asahel hath not been willing to turn  aside from after him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;And Abner addeth again, saying unto Asahel, `Turn thee  aside from after me, why do I smite thee to the earth? and how  do I lift up my face unto Joab thy brother?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:23">2:23</A>&nbsp;And he refuseth to turn aside, and Abner smiteth him with  the hinder part of the spear unto the fifth [rib], and the  spear cometh out from behind him, and he falleth there, and  dieth under it; and it cometh to pass, every one who hath come  unto the place where Asahel hath fallen and dieth -- they stand  still.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:24">2:24</A>&nbsp;And Joab and Abishai pursue after Abner, and the sun hath  gone in, and they have come in unto the height of Ammah, which  [is] on the front of Giah, the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:25">2:25</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Benjamin gather themselves together after  Abner, and become one troop, and stand on the top of a certain  height,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:26">2:26</A>&nbsp;and Abner calleth unto Joab, and saith, `For ever doth the  sword consume? hast thou not known that it is bitterness in the  latter end? and till when dost thou not say to the people to  turn back from after their brethren?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:27">2:27</A>&nbsp;And Joab saith, `God liveth! for unless thou hadst spoken,  surely then from the morning had the people gone up each from  after his brother.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:28">2:28</A>&nbsp;And Joab bloweth with a trumpet, and all the people stand  still, and pursue no more after Israel, nor have they added any  more to fight.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:29">2:29</A>&nbsp;And Abner and his men have gone through the plain all that  night, and pass over the Jordan, and go on [through] all  Bithron, and come in to Mahanaim.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:30">2:30</A>&nbsp;And Joab hath turned back from after Abner, and gathereth  all the people, and there are lacking of the servants of David  nineteen men, and Asahel;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:31">2:31</A>&nbsp;and the servants of David have smitten of Benjamin, even  among the men of Abner, three hundred and sixty men -- they died.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:32">2:32</A>&nbsp;And they lift up Asahel, and bury him in the burying-place  of his father, which [is] in Beth-Lehem, and they go all the  night -- Joab and his men -- and it is light to them in Hebron.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;And the war is long between the house of Saul and the house  of David, and David is going on and [is] strong, and the house  of Saul are going on and [are] weak.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;And there are born to David sons in Hebron, and his  first-born is Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;and his second [is] Chileab, of Abigail wife of Nabal the  Carmelite, and the third [is] Absalom son of Maacah daughter of  Talmai king of Geshur,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;and the fourth [is] Adonijah son of Haggith, and the fifth  [is] Shephatiah son of Abital,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;and the sixth [is] Ithream, of Eglah wife of David; these  have been born to David in Hebron.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, in the war being between the house of  Saul and the house of David, that Abner hath been strengthening  himself in the house of Saul,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;and Saul hath a concubine, and her name [is] Rizpah daughter  of Aiah, and [Ish-Bosheth] saith unto Abner, `Wherefore hast  thou gone in unto the concubine of my father?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;And it is displeasing to Abner exceedingly, because of the  words of Ish-Bosheth, and he saith, `The head of a dog [am]  I -- that in reference to Judah to-day I do kindness with the  house of Saul thy father, unto his brethren, and unto his  friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of  David -- that thou chargest against me iniquity concerning the  woman to-day?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;thus doth God to Abner, and thus He doth add to him, surely  as Jehovah hath sworn to David -- surely so I do to him:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;to cause the kingdom to pass over from the house of Saul,  and to raise up the throne of David over Israel, and over  Judah, from Dan even unto Beer-Sheba.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;And he is not able any more to turn back Abner a word,  because of his fearing him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;And Abner sendeth messengers unto David for himself, saying,  `Whose [is] the land?' saying, `Make thy covenant with me, and  lo, my hand [is] with thee, to bring round unto thee all  Israel.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;And he saith, `Good -- I make with thee a covenant; only, one  thing I am asking of thee, that is, Thou dost not see my face,  except thou dost first bring in Michal, daughter of Saul in thy  coming into see my face.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;And David sendeth messengers unto Ish-Bosheth son of Saul,  saying, `Give up my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself  with a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;And Ish-Bosheth sendeth, and taketh her from a man, from  Phaltiel son of Laish,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;and her husband goeth with her, going on and weeping behind  her, unto Bahurim, and Abner saith unto him, `Go, turn back;'  and he turneth back.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;And the word of Abner was with the elders of Israel,  saying, `Heretofore ye have been seeking David for king over  you,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;and now, do [it], for Jehovah hath spoken of David saying,  By the hand of David my servant -- to save My people Israel out  of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all  their enemies.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;And Abner speaketh also in the ears of Benjamin, and Abner  goeth also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that  [is] good in the eyes of Israel, and in the eyes of all the  house of Benjamin,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;and Abner cometh in unto David, to Hebron, and with him  twenty men, and David maketh for Abner, and for the men who  [are] with him, a banquet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;And Abner saith unto David, `I arise, and go, and gather  unto my lord the king the whole of Israel, and they make with  thee a covenant, and thou hast reigned over all that thy soul  desireth;' and David sendeth away Abner, and he goeth in peace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;And lo, the servants of David, and Joab, have come from the  troop, and much spoil have brought with them, and Abner is not  with David in Hebron, for he hath sent him away, and he goeth  in peace;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:23">3:23</A>&nbsp;and Joab and all the host that [is] with him have come, and  they declare to Joab, saying, `Abner son of Ner hath come unto  the king, and he sendeth him away, and he goeth in peace.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:24">3:24</A>&nbsp;And Joab cometh unto the king, and saith, `What hast thou  done? lo, Abner hath come unto thee! why [is] this -- thou hast  sent him away, and he is really gone?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:25">3:25</A>&nbsp;Thou hast known Abner son of Ner, that to deceive thee he  came, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all  that thou art doing.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:26">3:26</A>&nbsp;And Joab goeth out from David, and sendeth messengers after  Abner, and they bring him back from the well of Sirah, and  David knew not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:27">3:27</A>&nbsp;And Abner turneth back to Hebron, and Joab turneth him  aside unto the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and  smiteth him there in the fifth [rib] -- and he dieth -- for the  blood of Asahel his brother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:28">3:28</A>&nbsp;And David heareth afterwards and saith, `Acquitted [am] I,  and my kingdom, by Jehovah, unto the age, from the blood of  Abner son of Ner;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:29">3:29</A>&nbsp;it doth stay on the head of Joab, and on all the house of  his father, and there is not cut off from the house of Joab one  having an issue, and leprous, and laying hold on a staff, and  falling by a sword, and lacking bread.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:30">3:30</A>&nbsp;And Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner because that he  put to death Asahel their brother, in Gibeon, in battle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:31">3:31</A>&nbsp;And David saith unto Joab, and unto all the people who  [are] with him, `Rend your garments, and gird on sackcloth, and  mourn before Abner;' and king David is going after the bier.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:32">3:32</A>&nbsp;And they bury Abner in Hebron, and the king lifteth up his  voice, and weepeth at the grave of Abner, and all the people  weep;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:33">3:33</A>&nbsp;and the king lamenteth for Abner, and saith: -- `As the  death of a fool doth Abner die?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:34">3:34</A>&nbsp;Thy hands not bound, And thy feet to fetters not brought  nigh! As one falling before sons of evil -- Thou hast fallen!'  and all the people add to weep over him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:35">3:35</A>&nbsp;And all the people come to cause David to eat bread while  yet day, and David sweareth, saying, `Thus doth God to me, and  thus He doth add, for -- before the going in of the sun, I  taste no bread or any other thing.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:36">3:36</A>&nbsp;And all the people have discerned [it], and it is good in  their eyes, as all that the king hath done is good in the eyes  of all the people;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:37">3:37</A>&nbsp;and all the people know, even all Israel, in that day, that  it hath not been from the king -- to put to death Abner son of  Ner.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:38">3:38</A>&nbsp;And the king saith unto his servants, `Do ye not know that  a prince and a great one hath fallen this day in Israel?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:39">3:39</A>&nbsp;and I to-day [am] tender, and an anointed king: and these  men, sons of Zeruiah, [are] too hard for me; Jehovah doth  recompense to the doer of the evil according to his evil.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;And the son of Saul heareth that Abner [is] dead in Hebron,  and his hands are feeble, and all Israel have been troubled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;And two men, heads of troops, have been [to] the son of  Saul, the name of the one [is] Baanah, and the name of the  second Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the sons of  Benjamin, for also Beeroth is reckoned to Benjamin,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;and the Beerothites flee to Gittaim, and are there  sojourners unto this day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;And to Jonathan son of Saul [is] a son -- lame; he was a son  of five years at the coming in of the rumour of [the death of]  Saul and Jonathan, out of Jezreel, and his nurse lifteth him  up, and fleeth, and it cometh to pass in her hasting to flee,  that he falleth, and becometh lame, and his name [is]  Mephibosheth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah,  go, and come in at the heat of the day unto the house of  Ish-Bosheth, and he is lying down -- the lying down of noon;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;and thither they have come, unto the midst of the house,  taking wheat, and they smite him unto the fifth [rib], and  Rechab and Baanah his brother have escaped;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;yea, they come in to the house, and he is lying on his bed,  in the inner part of his bed-chamber, and they smite him, and  put him to death, and turn aside his head, and they take his  head, and go the way of the plain all the night,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;and bring in the head of Ish-Bosheth unto David in Hebron,  and say unto the king, `Lo, the head of Ish-Bosheth, son of  Saul, thine enemy, who sought thy life; and Jehovah doth give to  my lord the king vengeance this day, of Saul and of his  seed.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;And David answereth Rechab and Baanah his brother, sons of  Rimmon the Beerothite, and saith to them, `Jehovah liveth, who  hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;when one is declaring to me, saying, Lo, Saul is dead, and  he was as a bearer of tidings in his own eyes, then I take hold  on him, and slay him in Ziklag, instead of my giving to him  [for] the tidings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;Also -- when wicked men have slain the righteous man in his  own house, on his bed; and now, do not I require his blood of  your hand, and have taken you away from the earth?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;And David commandeth the young men, and they slay them, and  cut off their hands and their feet, and hang [them] over the  pool in Hebron, and the head of Ish-Bosheth they have taken,  and bury [it] in the burying-place of Abner in Hebron.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;And all the tribes of Israel come unto David, to Hebron, and  speak, saying, `Lo, we [are] thy bone and thy flesh;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;also heretofore, in Saul's being king over us, thou hast  been he who is bringing out and bringing in Israel, and Jehovah  saith to thee, Thou dost feed My people Israel, and thou art  for leader over Israel.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;And all the elders of Israel come unto the king, to Hebron,  and king David maketh with them a covenant in Hebron before  Jehovah, and they anoint David for king over Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;A son of thirty years [is] David in his being king; forty  years he hath reigned;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;in Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months,  and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years, over all  Israel and Judah.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;And David hath not been willing to turn aside unto himself  the ark of Jehovah, to the city of David, and David turneth it  aside to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_6:16">6:16</A>&nbsp;and it hath come to pass, the ark of Jehovah hath come in  to the city of David, and Michal daughter of Saul, hath looked  through the window, and seeth king David moving and dancing  before Jehovah, and despiseth him in her heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:17">6:17</A>&nbsp;And they bring in the ark of Jehovah, and set it up in its  place, in the midst of the tent which David hath spread out for  it, and David causeth to ascend burnt-offerings before Jehovah,  and peace-offerings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:18">6:18</A>&nbsp;And David finisheth from causing to ascend the  burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, and blesseth the  people in the name of Jehovah of Hosts,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:19">6:19</A>&nbsp;and he apportioneth to all the people, to all the multitude  of Israel, from man even unto woman, to each, one cake of  bread, and one eshpar, and one ashisha, and all the people go,  each to his house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:20">6:20</A>&nbsp;And David turneth back to bless his house, and Michal  daughter of Saul goeth out to meet David, and saith, `How  honourable to-day was the king of Israel, who was uncovered  to-day before the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one  of the vain ones is openly uncovered!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:21">6:21</A>&nbsp;And David saith unto Michal, `-- Before Jehovah, who fixed  on me above thy father, and above all his house, to appoint me  leader over the people of Jehovah, and over Israel, -- yea, I  played before Jehovah;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;that the king saith unto Nathan the prophet, `See, I pray  thee, I am dwelling in a house of cedars, and the ark of God is  dwelling in the midst of the curtain.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;And Nathan saith unto the king, `All that [is] in thine  heart -- go, do, for Jehovah [is] with thee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass in that night, that the word of  Jehovah is unto Nathan, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;`Go, and thou hast said unto My servant, unto David, Thus  said Jehovah, Dost thou build for Me a house for My dwelling  in?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;for I have not dwelt in a house even from the day of My  bringing up the sons of Israel out of Egypt, even unto this  day, and am walking up and down in a tent and in a tabernacle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;During all [the time] that I have walked up and down among  all the sons of Israel, a word have I spoken with one of the  tribes of Israel which I commanded to feed my people Israel,  saying, `Why have ye not built to Me a house of cedars?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;and now, thus dost thou say to My servant, to David: `Thus  said Jehovah of Hosts, I have taken thee from the comely place,  from after the flock, to be leader over My people, over Israel;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;and I have appointed a place for My people, for Israel, and  have planted it, and it hath tabernacled in its place, and it  is not troubled any more, and the sons of perverseness do not  add to afflict it any more, as in the beginning,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;even from the day that I appointed judges over My people  Israel; and I have given rest to thee from all thine enemies,  and Jehovah hath declared to thee that Jehovah doth make for  thee a house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;`When thy days are full, and thou hast lain with thy  fathers, then I have raised up thy seed after thee which goeth  out from thy bowels, and have established his kingdom;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_7:27">7:27</A>&nbsp;For Thou, Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, Thou hast  uncovered the ear of Thy servant, saying, A house I build for  thee, therefore hath Thy servant found his heart to pray unto  Thee this prayer;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:28">7:28</A>&nbsp;And now, Lord Jehovah, Thou [art] God Himself, and Thy  words are truth, and Thou speakest unto Thy servant this  goodness,</p>

And David  is dwelling in Jerusalem,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:2">11:2</A>&nbsp;and it cometh to pass, at evening-time, that David riseth  from off his couch, and walketh up and down on the roof of the  king's house, and seeth from the roof a woman bathing, and the  woman [is] of very good appearance,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:3">11:3</A>&nbsp;and David sendeth and inquireth about the woman, and saith,  `Is not this Bath-Sheba, daughter of Eliam, wife of Uriah the  Hittite?'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:1">12:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah sendeth Nathan unto David, and he cometh unto  him, and saith to him: `Two men have been in one city; One rich  and one poor;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:4">12:4</A>&nbsp;And there cometh a traveller to the rich man, And he  spareth to take Of his own flock, and of his own herd, To  prepare for the traveller Who hath come to him, And he taketh  the ewe-lamb of the poor man, And prepareth it for the man Who  hath come unto him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:5">12:5</A>&nbsp;And the anger of David burneth against the man exceedingly,  and he saith unto Nathan, `Jehovah liveth, surely a son of  death [is] the man who is doing this,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:12">12:12</A>&nbsp;for thou hast done [it] in secret, and I do this thing  before all Israel, and before the sun.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:13">12:13</A>&nbsp;And David saith unto Nathan, `I have sinned against  Jehovah.' And Nathan saith unto David, `Also -- Jehovah hath  caused thy sin to pass away; thou dost not die;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:16">12:16</A>&nbsp;and David seeketh God for the youth, and David keepeth a  fast, and hath gone in and lodged, and lain on the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:17">12:17</A>&nbsp;And the elders of his house rise against him, to raise him  up from the earth, and he hath not been willing, nor hath he  eaten with them bread;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:18">12:18</A>&nbsp;and it cometh to pass on the seventh day, that the lad  dieth, and the servants of David fear to declare to him that  the lad is dead, for they said, `Lo, in the lad being alive we  spake unto him, and he did not hearken to our voice; and how do  we say unto him, The lad is dead? -- then he hath done evil.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:19">12:19</A>&nbsp;And David seeth that his servants are whispering, and  David understandeth that the lad is dead, and David saith unto  his servants, `Is the lad dead?' and they say, `Dead.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:20">12:20</A>&nbsp;And David riseth from the earth, and doth bathe and anoint  [himself], and changeth his raiment, and cometh in to the house  of Jehovah, and boweth himself, and cometh unto his house, and  asketh and they place for him bread, and he eateth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:21">12:21</A>&nbsp;And his servants say unto him, `What [is] this thing thou  hast done? because of the living lad thou hast fasted and dost  weep, and when the lad is dead thou hast risen and dost eat  bread.'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:24">12:24</A>&nbsp;And David comforteth Bath-Sheba his wife, and goeth in  unto her, and lieth with her, and she beareth a son, and he  calleth his name Solomon; and Jehovah hath loved him,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:30">12:30</A>&nbsp;and he taketh the crown of their king from off his head,  and its weight [is] a talent of gold, and precious stones, and  it is on the head of David; and the spoil of the city he hath  brought out, very much;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:31">12:31</A>&nbsp;and the people who [are] in it he hath brought out, and  setteth to the saw, and to cutting instruments of iron, and to  axes of iron, and hath caused them to pass over into the  brick-kiln; and so he doth to all the cities of the Bene-Ammon;  and David turneth back, and all the people, to Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:1">13:1</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass afterwards that Absalom son of David  hath a fair sister, and her name [is] Tamar, and Amnon son of  David loveth her.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_13:5">13:5</A>&nbsp;And Jonadab saith to him, `Lie down on thy couch, and feign  thyself sick, and thy father hath come in to see thee, and thou  hast said unto him, `Let, I pray thee, Tamar my sister come in  and give me bread to eat; and she hath made the food before  mine eyes so that I see [it], and have eaten from her hand.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:6">13:6</A>&nbsp;And Amnon lieth down, and feigneth himself sick, and the  king cometh in to see him, and Amnon saith unto the king, `Let,  I pray thee, Tamar my sister come, and she maketh before mine  eyes two cakes, and I eat from her hand.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:7">13:7</A>&nbsp;And David sendeth unto Tamar, to the house, saying, `Go, I  pray thee, to the house of Amnon thy brother, and make for him  food.'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_13:15">13:15</A>&nbsp;And Amnon hateth her -- a very great hatred -- that greater  [is] the hatred with which he hath hated her than the love with  which he loved her, and Amnon saith to her, `Rise, go.'</p>

Let, I pray Thee, Thy hand be on  me, and on the house of my father.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:18">24:18</A>&nbsp;And Gad cometh in unto David on that day, and saith to  him, `Go up, raise to Jehovah an altar in the threshing-floor  of Araunah the Jebusite;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:19">24:19</A>&nbsp;and David goeth up, according to the word of Gad, as  Jehovah commanded.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:20">24:20</A>&nbsp;And Araunah looketh, and seeth the king and his servants  passing over unto him, and Araunah goeth out and boweth himself  to the king -- his face to the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:21">24:21</A>&nbsp;And Araunah saith, `Wherefore hath my lord the king come  unto his servant?' and David saith, `To buy from thee the  threshing-floor, to build an altar to Jehovah, and the plague  is restrained from the people.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:22">24:22</A>&nbsp;And Araunah saith unto David, `Let my lord the king take  and cause to ascend that which is good in his eyes; see, the  oxen for a burnt-offering, and the threshing instruments, and  the instruments of the oxen, for wood;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:23">24:23</A>&nbsp;the whole hath Araunah given, [as] a king to a king; and  Araunah saith unto the king, `Jehovah thy God doth accept  thee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:24">24:24</A>&nbsp;And the king saith unto Araunah, `Nay, for I do surely buy  from thee for a price, and I do not cause to ascend to Jehovah  my God burnt-offerings for nought;' and David buyeth the  threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:25">24:25</A>&nbsp;and David buildeth there an altar to Jehovah, and causeth  to ascend burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and Jehovah is  entreated for the land, and the plague is restrained from  Israel.</p>
