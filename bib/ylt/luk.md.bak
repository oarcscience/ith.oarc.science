### Young's Literal Translation: Luke

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Seeing that many did take in hand to set in
order a narration of the matters that have been fully assured among us,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> as they did deliver to us, who from the
beginning became eye-witnesses, and officers of the Word, --

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> it seemed good also to me, having followed
from the first after all things exactly, to write to thee in order, most
noble Theophilus,

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> that thou mayest know the certainty of the
things wherein thou wast instructed.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> There was in the days of Herod, the king of
Judea, a certain priest, by name Zacharias, of the course of Abijah, and
his wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elisabeth;

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> and they were both righteous before God,
going on in all the commands and righteousnesses of the Lord blameless,

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> and they had no child, because that
Elisabeth was barren, and both were advanced in their days.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> And it came to pass, in his acting as
priest, in the order of his course before God,

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> according to the custom of the priesthood,
his lot was to make perfume, having gone into the sanctuary of the Lord,

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> and all the multitude of the people were
praying without, at the hour of the perfume.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> And there appeared to him a messenger of
the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of the perfume,

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> and Zacharias, having seen, was troubled,
and fear fell on him;

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> and the messenger said unto him, \`Fear
not, Zacharias, for thy supplication was heard, and thy wife Elisabeth
shall bear a son to thee, and thou shalt call his name John,

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> and there shall be joy to thee, and
gladness, and many at his birth shall joy,

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> for he shall be great before the Lord,
and wine and strong drink he may not drink, and of the Holy Spirit he
shall be full, even from his mother's womb;

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> and many of the sons of Israel he shall
turn to the Lord their God,

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> and he shall go before Him, in the spirit
and power of Elijah, to turn hearts of fathers unto children, and
disobedient ones to the wisdom of righteous ones, to make ready for the
Lord, a people prepared.'

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> And Zacharias said unto the messenger,
\`Whereby shall I know this? for I am aged, and my wife is advanced in
her days?'

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> And the messenger answering said to him,
\`I am Gabriel, who have been standing near before God, and I was sent
to speak unto thee, and to proclaim these good news to thee,

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> and lo, thou shalt be silent, and not
able to speak, till the day that these things shall come to pass,
because thou didst not believe my words, that shall be fulfilled in
their season.'

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> And the people were waiting for
Zacharias, and wondering at his tarrying in the sanctuary,

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> and having come out, he was not able to
speak to them, and they perceived that a vision he had seen in the
sanctuary, and he was beckoning to them, and did remain dumb.

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> And it came to pass, when the days of his
service were fulfilled, he went away to his house,

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> and after those days, his wife Elisabeth
conceived, and hid herself five months, saying --

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> \`Thus hath the Lord done to me, in days
in which He looked upon \[me\], to take away my reproach among men.'

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> And in the sixth month was the messenger
Gabriel sent by God, to a city of Galilee, the name of which \[is\]
Nazareth,

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> to a virgin, betrothed to a man, whose
name \[is\] Joseph, of the house of David, and the name of the virgin
\[is\] Mary.

<span id="an_1:28">1:28</span> And the messenger having come in unto
her, said, \`Hail, favoured one, the Lord \[is\] with thee; blessed
\[art\] thou among women;'

<span id="an_1:29">1:29</span> and she, having seen, was troubled at his
word, and was reasoning of what kind this salutation may be.

<span id="an_1:30">1:30</span> And the messenger said to her, \`Fear
not, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God;

<span id="an_1:31">1:31</span> and lo, thou shalt conceive in the womb,
and shalt bring forth a son, and call his name Jesus;

<span id="an_1:32">1:32</span> he shall be great, and Son of the Highest
he shall be called, and the Lord God shall give him the throne of David
his father,

<span id="an_1:33">1:33</span> and he shall reign over the house of
Jacob to the ages; and of his reign there shall be no end.'

<span id="an_1:34">1:34</span> And Mary said unto the messenger, \`How
shall this be, seeing a husband I do not know?'

<span id="an_1:35">1:35</span> And the messenger answering said to her,
\`The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest
shall overshadow thee, therefore also the holy-begotten thing shall be
called Son of God;

<span id="an_1:36">1:36</span> and lo, Elisabeth, thy kinswoman, she
also hath conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month to
her who was called barren;

<span id="an_1:37">1:37</span> because nothing shall be impossible with
God.'

<span id="an_1:38">1:38</span> And Mary said, \`Lo, the maid-servant of
the Lord; let it be to me according to thy saying,' and the messenger
went away from her.

<span id="an_1:39">1:39</span> And Mary having arisen in those days,
went to the hill-country, with haste, to a city of Judea,

<span id="an_1:40">1:40</span> and entered into the house of Zacharias,
and saluted Elisabeth.

<span id="an_1:41">1:41</span> And it came to pass, when Elisabeth heard
the salutation of Mary, the babe did leap in her womb; and Elisabeth was
filled with the Holy Spirit,

<span id="an_1:42">1:42</span> and spake out with a loud voice, and
said, \`Blessed \[art\] thou among women, and blessed \[is\] the fruit
of thy womb;

<span id="an_1:43">1:43</span> and whence \[is\] this to me, that the
mother of my Lord might come unto me?

<span id="an_1:44">1:44</span> for, lo, when the voice of thy salutation
came to my ears, leap in gladness did the babe in my womb;

<span id="an_1:45">1:45</span> and happy \[is\] she who did believe, for
there shall be a completion to the things spoken to her from the Lord.'

<span id="an_1:46">1:46</span> And Mary said, \`My soul doth magnify the
Lord,

<span id="an_1:47">1:47</span> And my spirit was glad on God my Saviour,

<span id="an_1:48">1:48</span> Because He looked on the lowliness of His
maid-servant, For, lo, henceforth call me happy shall all the
generations,

<span id="an_1:49">1:49</span> For He who is mighty did to me great
things, And holy \[is\] His name,

<span id="an_1:50">1:50</span> And His kindness \[is\] to generations of
generations, To those fearing Him,

<span id="an_1:51">1:51</span> He did powerfully with His arm, He
scattered abroad the proud in the thought of their heart,

<span id="an_1:52">1:52</span> He brought down the mighty from thrones,
And He exalted the lowly,

<span id="an_1:53">1:53</span> The hungry He did fill with good, And the
rich He sent away empty,

<span id="an_1:54">1:54</span> He received again Israel His servant, To
remember kindness,

<span id="an_1:55">1:55</span> As He spake unto our fathers, To Abraham
and to his seed -- to the age.'

<span id="an_1:56">1:56</span> And Mary remained with her about three
months, and turned back to her house.

<span id="an_1:57">1:57</span> And to Elisabeth was the time fulfilled
for her bringing forth, and she bare a son,

<span id="an_1:58">1:58</span> and the neighbours and her kindred heard
that the Lord was making His kindness great with her, and they were
rejoicing with her.

<span id="an_1:59">1:59</span> And it came to pass, on the eighth day,
they came to circumcise the child, and they were calling him by the name
of his father, Zacharias,

<span id="an_1:60">1:60</span> and his mother answering said, \`No, but
he shall be called John.'

<span id="an_1:61">1:61</span> And they said unto her -- \`There is none
among thy kindred who is called by this name,'

<span id="an_1:62">1:62</span> and they were making signs to his father,
what he would wish him to be called,

<span id="an_1:63">1:63</span> and having asked for a tablet, he wrote,
saying, \`John is his name;' and they did all wonder;

<span id="an_1:64">1:64</span> and his mouth was opened presently, and
his tongue, and he was speaking, praising God.

<span id="an_1:65">1:65</span> And fear came upon all those dwelling
around them, and in all the hill-country of Judea were all these sayings
spoken of,

<span id="an_1:66">1:66</span> and all who heard did lay them up in
their hearts, saying, \`What then shall this child be?' and the hand of
the Lord was with him.

<span id="an_1:67">1:67</span> And Zacharias his father was filled with
the Holy Spirit, and did prophesy, saying,

<span id="an_1:68">1:68</span> \`Blessed \[is\] the Lord, the God of
Israel, Because He did look upon, And wrought redemption for His people,

<span id="an_1:69">1:69</span> And did raise an horn of salvation to us,
In the house of David His servant,

<span id="an_1:70">1:70</span> As He spake by the mouth of His holy
prophets, Which have been from the age;

<span id="an_1:71">1:71</span> Salvation from our enemies, And out of
the hand of all hating us,

<span id="an_1:72">1:72</span> To do kindness with our fathers, And to
be mindful of His holy covenant,

<span id="an_1:73">1:73</span> An oath that He sware to Abraham our
father,

<span id="an_1:74">1:74</span> To give to us, without fear, Out of the
hand of our enemies having been delivered,

<span id="an_1:75">1:75</span> To serve Him, in holiness and
righteousness Before Him, all the days of our life.

<span id="an_1:76">1:76</span> And thou, child, Prophet of the Highest
Shalt thou be called; For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord, To
prepare His ways.

<span id="an_1:77">1:77</span> To give knowledge of salvation to His
people In remission of their sins,

<span id="an_1:78">1:78</span> Through the tender mercies of our God, In
which the rising from on high did look upon us,

<span id="an_1:79">1:79</span> To give light to those sitting in
darkness and death-shade, To guide our feet to a way of peace.'

<span id="an_1:80">1:80</span> And the child grew, and was strengthened
in spirit, and he was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto
Israel.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> And it came to pass in those days, there
went forth a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world be enrolled
--

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> this enrollment first came to pass when
Cyrenius was governor of Syria --

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> and all were going to be enrolled, each to
his proper city,

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> and Joseph also went up from Galilee, out
of the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, that is called
Bethlehem, because of his being of the house and family of David,

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> to enroll himself with Mary his betrothed
wife, being with child.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> And it came to pass, in their being there,
the days were fulfilled for her bringing forth,

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> and she brought forth her son -- the
first-born, and wrapped him up, and laid him down in the manger, because
there was not for them a place in the guest-chamber.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> And there were shepherds in the same
region, lodging in the field, and keeping the night-watches over their
flock,

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> and lo, a messenger of the Lord stood over
them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they feared a
great fear.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> And the messenger said to them, \`Fear
not, for lo, I bring you good news of great joy, that shall be to all
the people --

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> because there was born to you to-day a
Saviour -- who is Christ the Lord -- in the city of David,

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> and this \[is\] to you the sign: Ye shall
find a babe wrapped up, lying in the manger.'

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And suddenly there came with the
messenger a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God, and saying,

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> \`Glory in the highest to God, and upon
earth peace, among men -- good will.'

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> And it came to pass, when the messengers
were gone away from them to the heavens, that the men, the shepherds,
said unto one another, \`We may go over indeed unto Bethlehem, and see
this thing that hath come to pass, that the Lord did make known to us.'

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> And they came, having hasted, and found
both Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger,

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> and having seen, they made known abroad
concerning the saying spoken to them concerning the child.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> And all who heard, did wonder concerning
the things spoken by the shepherds unto them;

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> and Mary was preserving all these things,
pondering in her heart;

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> and the shepherds turned back, glorifying
and praising God, for all those things they heard and saw, as it was
spoken unto them.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> And when eight days were fulfilled to
circumcise the child, then was his name called Jesus, having been so
called by the messenger before his being conceived in the womb.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> And when the days of their purification
were fulfilled, according to the law of Moses, they brought him up to
Jerusalem, to present to the Lord,

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> as it hath been written in the Law of the
Lord, -- \`Every male opening a womb shall be called holy to the Lord,'

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> and to give a sacrifice, according to
that said in the Law of the Lord, \`A pair of turtle-doves, or two young
pigeons.'

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> And lo, there was a man in Jerusalem,
whose name \[is\] Simeon, and this man is righteous and devout, looking
for the comforting of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him,

<span id="an_2:26">2:26</span> and it hath been divinely told him by the
Holy Spirit -- not to see death before he may see the Christ of the
Lord.

<span id="an_2:27">2:27</span> And he came in the Spirit to the temple,
and in the parents bringing in the child Jesus, for their doing
according to the custom of the law regarding him,

<span id="an_2:28">2:28</span> then he took him in his arms, and blessed
God, and he said,

<span id="an_2:29">2:29</span> \`Now Thou dost send away Thy servant,
Lord, according to Thy word, in peace,

<span id="an_2:30">2:30</span> because mine eyes did see Thy salvation,

<span id="an_2:31">2:31</span> which Thou didst prepare before the face
of all the peoples,

<span id="an_2:32">2:32</span> a light to the uncovering of nations, and
the glory of Thy people Israel.'

<span id="an_2:33">2:33</span> And Joseph and his mother were wondering
at the things spoken concerning him,

<span id="an_2:34">2:34</span> and Simeon blessed them, and said unto
Mary his mother, \`Lo, this \[one\] is set for the falling and rising
again of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against --

<span id="an_2:35">2:35</span> (and also thine own soul shall a sword
pass through) -- that the reasonings of many hearts may be revealed.'

<span id="an_2:36">2:36</span> And there was Anna, a prophetess,
daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher, she was much advanced in
days, having lived with an husband seven years from her virginity,

<span id="an_2:37">2:37</span> and she \[is\] a widow of about
eighty-four years, who did depart not from the temple, with fasts and
supplications serving, night and day,

<span id="an_2:38">2:38</span> and she, at that hour, having come in,
was confessing, likewise, to the Lord, and was speaking concerning him,
to all those looking for redemption in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_2:39">2:39</span> And when they finished all things,
according to the Law of the Lord, they turned back to Galilee, to their
city Nazareth;

<span id="an_2:40">2:40</span> and the child grew and was strengthened
in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.

<span id="an_2:41">2:41</span> And his parents were going yearly to
Jerusalem, at the feast of the passover,

<span id="an_2:42">2:42</span> and when he became twelve years old, they
having gone up to Jerusalem, according to the custom of the feast,

<span id="an_2:43">2:43</span> and having finished the days, in their
returning the child Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, and Joseph and
his mother did not know,

<span id="an_2:44">2:44</span> and, having supposed him to be in the
company, they went a day's journey, and were seeking him among the
kindred and among the acquaintances,

<span id="an_2:45">2:45</span> and not having found him, they turned
back to Jerusalem seeking him.

<span id="an_2:46">2:46</span> And it came to pass, after three days,
they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both
hearing them and questioning them,

<span id="an_2:47">2:47</span> and all those hearing him were astonished
at his understanding and answers.

<span id="an_2:48">2:48</span> And, having seen him, they were amazed,
and his mother said unto him, \`Child, why didst thou thus to us? lo,
thy father and I, sorrowing, were seeking thee.'

<span id="an_2:49">2:49</span> And he said unto them, \`Why \[is it\]
that ye were seeking me? did ye not know that in the things of my Father
it behoveth me to be?'

<span id="an_2:50">2:50</span> and they did not understand the saying
that he spake to them,

<span id="an_2:51">2:51</span> and he went down with them, and came to
Nazareth, and he was subject to them, and his mother was keeping all
these sayings in her heart,

<span id="an_2:52">2:52</span> and Jesus was advancing in wisdom, and in
stature, and in favour with God and men.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> And in the fifteenth year of the government
of Tiberius Caesar -- Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod
tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his brother, tetrarch of Ituraea and of
the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene --

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> Annas and Caiaphas being chief priests --
there came a word of God unto John the son of Zacharias, in the
wilderness,

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> and he came to all the region round the
Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of reformation -- to remission of sins,

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> as it hath been written in the scroll of
the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying, \`A voice of one crying in the
wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, straight make ye His paths;

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> every valley shall be filled, and every
mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall become
straightness, and the rough become smooth ways;

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> and all flesh shall see the salvation of
God.'

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Then said he to the multitudes coming forth
to be baptised by him, \`Brood of vipers! who did prompt you to flee
from the coming wrath?

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> make, therefore, fruits worthy of the
reformation, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have a father --
Abraham; for I say to you, that God is able out of these stones to raise
children to Abraham;

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> and already also the axe unto the root of
the trees is laid, every tree, therefore, not making good fruit is cut
down, and to fire it is cast.'

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> And the multitudes were questioning him,
saying, \`What, then, shall we do?'

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> and he answering saith to them, \`He
having two coats -- let him impart to him having none, and he having
victuals -- in like manner let him do.'

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> And there came also tax-gatherers to be
baptised, and they said unto him, \`Teacher, what shall we do?'

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> and he said unto them, \`Exact no more
than that directed you.'

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> And questioning him also were those
warring, saying, \`And we, what shall we do?' and he said unto them,
\`Do violence to no one, nor accuse falsely, and be content with your
wages.'

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> And the people are looking forward, and
all are reasoning in their hearts concerning John, whether or not he may
be the Christ;

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> John answered, saying to all, \`I indeed
with water do baptise you, but he cometh who is mightier than I, of whom
I am not worthy to loose the latchet of his sandals -- he shall baptise
you with the Holy Spirit and with fire;

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> whose winnowing shovel \[is\] in his
hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor, and will gather the
wheat to his storehouse, and the chaff he will burn with fire
unquenchable.'

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> And, therefore, indeed with many other
things, exhorting, he was proclaiming good news to the people,

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> and Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by
him concerning Herodias the wife of Philip his brother, and concerning
all the evils that Herod did,

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> added also this to all, that he shut up
John in the prison.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> And it came to pass, in all the people
being baptised, Jesus also being baptised, and praying, the heaven was
opened,

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> and the Holy Spirit came down in a bodily
appearance, as if a dove, upon him, and a voice came out of heaven,
saying, \`Thou art My Son -- the Beloved, in thee I did delight.'

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> And Jesus himself was beginning to be
about thirty years of age, being, as was supposed, son of Joseph,

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> the \[son\] of Eli, the \[son\] of
Matthat, the \[son\] of Levi, the \[son\] of Melchi, the \[son\] of
Janna, the \[son\] of Joseph,

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> the \[son\] of Mattathias, the \[son\] of
Amos, the \[son\] of Naum, the \[son\] of Esli,

<span id="an_3:26">3:26</span> the \[son\] of Naggai, the \[son\] of
Maath, the \[son\] of Mattathias, the \[son\] of Semei, the \[son\] of
Joseph, the \[son\] of Juda,

<span id="an_3:27">3:27</span> the \[son\] of Joanna, the \[son\] of
Rhesa, the \[son\] of Zerubbabel, the \[son\] of Shealtiel,

<span id="an_3:28">3:28</span> the \[son\] of Neri, the \[son\] of
Melchi, the \[son\] of Addi, the \[son\] of Cosam, the \[son\] of
Elmodam, the \[son\] of Er,

<span id="an_3:29">3:29</span> the \[son\] of Jose, the \[son\] of
Eliezer, the \[son\] of Jorim, the \[son\] of Matthat,

<span id="an_3:30">3:30</span> the \[son\] of Levi, the \[son\] of
Simeon, the \[son\] of Juda, the \[son\] of Joseph, the \[son\] of
Jonan, the \[son\] of Eliakim,

<span id="an_3:31">3:31</span> the \[son\] of Melea, the \[son\] of
Mainan, the \[son\] of Mattatha, the \[son\] of Nathan,

<span id="an_3:32">3:32</span> the \[son\] of David, the \[son\] of
Jesse, the \[son\] of Obed, the \[son\] of Booz, the \[son\] of Salmon,
the \[son\] of Nahshon,

<span id="an_3:33">3:33</span> the \[son\] of Amminadab, the \[son\] of
Aram, the \[son\] of Esrom, the \[son\] of Pharez,

<span id="an_3:34">3:34</span> the \[son\] of Judah, the \[son\] of
Jacob, the \[son\] of Isaac, the \[son\] of Abraham, the \[son\] of
Terah, the \[son\] of Nahor,

<span id="an_3:35">3:35</span> the \[son\] of Serug, the \[son\] of Reu,
the \[son\] of Peleg, the \[son\] of Eber,

<span id="an_3:36">3:36</span> the \[son\] of Salah, the \[son\] of
Cainan, the \[son\] of Arphaxad, the \[son\] of Shem, the \[son\] of
Noah, the \[son\] of Lamech,

<span id="an_3:37">3:37</span> the \[son\] of Methuselah, the \[son\] of

<span id="an_3:38">3:38</span> the \[son\] of Cainan, the \[son\] of
Enos, the \[son\] of Seth, the \[son\] of Adam, the \[son\] of God.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, turned
back from the Jordan, and was brought in the Spirit to the wilderness,

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> forty days being tempted by the Devil, and
he did not eat anything in those days, and they having been ended, he
afterward hungered,

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> and the Devil said to him, \`If Son thou
art of God, speak to this stone that it may become bread.'

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> And Jesus answered him, saying, \`It hath
been written, that, not on bread only shall man live, but on every
saying of God.'

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> And the Devil having brought him up to an
high mountain, shewed to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment
of time,

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> and the Devil said to him, \`To thee I will
give all this authority, and their glory, because to me it hath been
delivered, and to whomsoever I will, I do give it;

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> thou, then, if thou mayest bow before me --
all shall be thine.'

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> And Jesus answering him said, \`Get thee
behind me, Adversary, for it hath been written, Thou shalt bow before
the Lord thy God, and Him only thou shalt serve.'

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set
him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, \`If the Son thou
art of God, cast thyself down hence,

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> for it hath been written -- To His
messengers He will give charge concerning thee, to guard over thee,

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> and -- On hands they shall bear thee up,
lest at any time thou mayest dash against a stone thy foot.'

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> And Jesus answering said to him -- \`It
hath been said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.'

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> And having ended all temptation, the
Devil departed from him till a convenient season.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> And Jesus turned back in the power of the
Spirit to Galilee, and a fame went forth through all the region round
about concerning him,

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> and he was teaching in their synagogues,
being glorified by all.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> And he came to Nazareth, where he hath
been brought up, and he went in, according to his custom, on the
sabbath-day, to the synagogue, and stood up to read;

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> and there was given over to him a roll of
Isaiah the prophet, and having unfolded the roll, he found the place
where it hath been written:

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> \`The Spirit of the Lord \[is\] upon me,
Because He did anoint me; To proclaim good news to the poor, Sent me to
heal the broken of heart, To proclaim to captives deliverance, And to
blind receiving of sight, To send away the bruised with deliverance,

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> To proclaim the acceptable year of the
Lord.'

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> And having folded the roll, having given
\[it\] back to the officer, he sat down, and the eyes of all in the
synagogue were gazing on him.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> And he began to say unto them -- \`To-day
hath this writing been fulfilled in your ears;'

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> and all were bearing testimony to him,
and were wondering at the gracious words that are coming forth out of
his mouth, and they said, \`Is not this the son of Joseph?'

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> And he said unto them, \`Certainly ye
will say to me this simile, Physician, heal thyself; as great things as
we heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country;'

<span id="an_4:24">4:24</span> and he said, \`Verily I say to you -- No
prophet is accepted in his own country;

<span id="an_4:25">4:25</span> and of a truth I say to you, Many widows
were in the days of Elijah, in Israel, when the heaven was shut for
three years and six months, when great famine came on all the land,

<span id="an_4:26">4:26</span> and unto none of them was Elijah sent,
but -- to Sarepta of Sidon, unto a woman, a widow;

<span id="an_4:27">4:27</span> and many lepers were in the time of
Elisha the prophet, in Israel, and none of them was cleansed, but --
Naaman the Syrian.'

<span id="an_4:28">4:28</span> And all in the synagogue were filled with
wrath, hearing these things,

<span id="an_4:29">4:29</span> and having risen, they put him forth
without the city, and brought him unto the brow of the hill on which
their city had been built -- to cast him down headlong,

<span id="an_4:30">4:30</span> and he, having gone through the midst of
them, went away.

<span id="an_4:31">4:31</span> And he came down to Capernaum, a city of
Galilee, and was teaching them on the sabbaths,

<span id="an_4:32">4:32</span> and they were astonished at his teaching,
because his word was with authority.

<span id="an_4:33">4:33</span> And in the synagogue was a man, having a
spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a great voice,

<span id="an_4:34">4:34</span> saying, \`Away, what -- to us and to
thee, Jesus, O Nazarene? thou didst come to destroy us; I have known
thee who thou art -- the Holy One of God.'

<span id="an_4:35">4:35</span> And Jesus did rebuke him, saying, \`Be
silenced, and come forth out of him;' and the demon having cast him into
the midst, came forth from him, having hurt him nought;

<span id="an_4:36">4:36</span> and amazement came upon all, and they
were speaking together, with one another, saying, \`What \[is\] this
word, that with authority and power he doth command the unclean spirits,
and they come forth?'

<span id="an_4:37">4:37</span> and there was going forth a fame
concerning him to every place of the region round about.

<span id="an_4:38">4:38</span> And having risen out of the synagogue, he
entered into the house of Simon, and the mother-in-law of Simon was
pressed with a great fever, and they did ask him about her,

<span id="an_4:39">4:39</span> and having stood over her, he rebuked the
fever, and it left her, and presently, having risen, she was ministering
to them.

<span id="an_4:40">4:40</span> And at the setting of the sun, all, as
many as had any ailing with manifold sicknesses, brought them unto him,
and he on each one of them \[his\] hands having put, did heal them.

<span id="an_4:41">4:41</span> And demons also were coming forth from
many, crying out and saying -- \`Thou art the Christ, the Son of God;'
and rebuking, he did not suffer them to speak, because they knew him to
be the Christ.

<span id="an_4:42">4:42</span> And day having come, having gone forth,
he went on to a desert place, and the multitudes were seeking him, and
they came unto him, and were staying him -- not to go on from them,

<span id="an_4:43">4:43</span> and he said unto them -- \`Also to the
other cities it behoveth me to proclaim good news of the reign of God,
because for this I have been sent;'

<span id="an_4:44">4:44</span> and he was preaching in the synagogues of
Galilee.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> And it came to pass, in the multitude
pressing on him to hear the word of God, that he was standing beside the
lake of Gennesaret,

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> and he saw two boats standing beside the
lake, and the fishers, having gone away from them, were washing the
nets,

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> and having entered into one of the boats,
that was Simon's, he asked him to put back a little from the land, and
having sat down, was teaching the multitudes out of the boat.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> And when he left off speaking, he said unto
Simon, \`Put back to the deep, and let down your nets for a draught;'

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> and Simon answering said to him, \`Master,
through the whole night, having laboured, we have taken nothing, but at
thy saying I will let down the net.'

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> And having done this, they enclosed a great
multitude of fishes, and their net was breaking,

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> and they beckoned to the partners, who
\[are\] in the other boat, having come, to help them; and they came, and
filled both the boats, so that they were sinking.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> And Simon Peter having seen, fell down at
the knees of Jesus, saying, \`Depart from me, because I am a sinful man,
O lord;'

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> for astonishment seized him, and all those
with him, at the draught of the fishes that they took,

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> and in like manner also James and John,
sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon; and Jesus said unto
Simon, \`Fear not, henceforth thou shalt be catching men;'

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> and they, having brought the boats upon
the land, having left all, did follow him.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> And it came to pass, in his being in one
of the cities, that lo, a man full of leprosy, and having seen Jesus,
having fallen on \[his\] face, he besought him, saying, \`Sir, if thou
mayest will, thou art able to cleanse me;'

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> and having stretched forth \[his\] hand,
he touched him, having said, \`I will; be thou cleansed;' and
immediately the leprosy went away from him.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> And he charged him to tell no one, \`But,
having gone away, shew thyself to the priest, and bring near for thy
cleansing according as Moses directed, for a testimony to them;'

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> but the more was the report going abroad
concerning him, and great multitudes were coming together to hear, and
to be healed by him of their infirmities,

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> and he was withdrawing himself in the
desert places and was praying.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> And it came to pass, on one of the days,
that he was teaching, and there were sitting by Pharisees and teachers
of the Law, who were come out of every village of Galilee, and Judea,
and Jerusalem, and the power of the Lord was -- to heal them.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> And lo, men bearing upon a couch a man,
who hath been struck with palsy, and they were seeking to bring him in,
and to place before him,

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> and not having found by what way they may
bring him in because of the multitude, having gone up on the house-top,
through the tiles they let him down, with the little couch, into the
midst before Jesus,

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> and he having seen their faith, said to
him, \`Man, thy sins have been forgiven thee.'

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> And the scribes and the Pharisees began
to reason, saying, \`Who is this that doth speak evil words? who is able
to forgive sins, except God only?'

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> And Jesus having known their reasonings,
answering, said unto them, \`What reason ye in your hearts?

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> which is easier -- to say, Thy sins have
been forgiven thee? or to say, Arise, and walk?

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> \`And that ye may know that the Son of
Man hath authority upon the earth to forgive sins -- (he said to the one
struck with palsy) -- I say to thee, Arise, and having taken up thy
little couch, be going on to thy house.'

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> And presently having risen before them,
having taken up \[that\] on which he was lying, he went away to his
house, glorifying God,

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> and astonishment took all, and they were
glorifying God, and were filled with fear, saying -- \`We saw strange
things to-day.'

<span id="an_5:27">5:27</span> And after these things he went forth, and
beheld a tax-gatherer, by name Levi, sitting at the tax-office, and said
to him, \`Be following me;'

<span id="an_5:28">5:28</span> and he, having left all, having arisen,
did follow him.

<span id="an_5:29">5:29</span> And Levi made a great entertainment to
him in his house, and there was a great multitude of tax-gatherers and
others who were with them reclining (at meat),

<span id="an_5:30">5:30</span> and the scribes and the Pharisees among
them were murmuring at his disciples, saying, \`Wherefore with
tax-gatherers and sinners do ye eat and drink?'

<span id="an_5:31">5:31</span> And Jesus answering said unto them,
\`They who are well have no need of a physician, but they that are ill:

<span id="an_5:32">5:32</span> I came not to call righteous men, but
sinners, to reformation.'

<span id="an_5:33">5:33</span> And they said unto him, \`Wherefore do
the disciples of John fast often, and make supplications -- in like
manner also those of the Pharisees -- but thine do eat and drink?'

<span id="an_5:34">5:34</span> And he said unto them, \`Are ye able to
make the sons of the bride-chamber -- in the bridegroom being with them
-- to fast?

<span id="an_5:35">5:35</span> but days will come, and, when the
bridegroom may be taken away from them, then they shall fast in those
days.'

<span id="an_5:36">5:36</span> And he spake also a simile unto them --
\`No one a patch of new clothing doth put on old clothing, and if
otherwise, the new also doth make a rent, and with the old the patch
doth not agree, that \[is\] from the new.

<span id="an_5:37">5:37</span> \`And no one doth put new wine into old
skins, and if otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins, and itself
will be poured out, and the skins will be destroyed;

<span id="an_5:38">5:38</span> but new wine into new skins is to be put,
and both are preserved together;

<span id="an_5:39">5:39</span> and no one having drunk old \[wine\],
doth immediately wish new, for he saith, The old is better.'

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> And it came to pass, on the second-first
sabbath, as he is going through the corn fields, that his disciples were
plucking the ears, and were eating, rubbing with the hands,

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> and certain of the Pharisees said to them,
\`Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbaths?'

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> And Jesus answering said unto them, \`Did
ye not read even this that David did, when he hungered, himself and
those who are with him,

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> how he went into the house of God, and the
loaves of the presentation did take, and did eat, and gave also to those
with him, which it is not lawful to eat, except only to the priests?'

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> and he said to them, -- \`The Son of Man is
lord also of the sabbath.'

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> And it came to pass also, on another
sabbath, that he goeth into the synagogue, and teacheth, and there was
there a man, and his right hand was withered,

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> and the scribes and the Pharisees were
watching him, if on the sabbath he will heal, that they might find an
accusation against him.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> And he himself had known their reasonings,
and said to the man having the withered hand, \`Rise, and stand in the
midst;' and he having risen, stood.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> Then said Jesus unto them, \`I will
question you something: Is it lawful on the sabbaths to do good, or to
do evil? life to save or to kill?'

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> And having looked round on them all, he
said to the man, \`Stretch forth thy hand;' and he did so, and his hand
was restored whole as the other;

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> and they were filled with madness, and
were speaking with one another what they might do to Jesus.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> And it came to pass in those days, he
went forth to the mountain to pray, and was passing the night in the
prayer of God,

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> and when it became day, he called near
his disciples, and having chosen from them twelve, whom also he named
apostles,

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> (Simon, whom also he named Peter, and
Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> Matthew and Thomas, James of Alphaeus,
and Simon called Zelotes,

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> Judas of James, and Judas Iscariot, who
also became betrayer;)

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> and having come down with them, he stood
upon a level spot, and a crowd of his disciples, and a great multitude
of the people from all Judea, and Jerusalem, and the maritime Tyre and
Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their sicknesses,

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> and those harassed by unclean spirits,
and they were healed,

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> and all the multitude were seeking to
touch him, because power from him was going forth, and he was healing
all.

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> And he, having lifted up his eyes to his
disciples, said: \`Happy the poor -- because yours is the reign of God.

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> \`Happy those hungering now -- because ye
shall be filled. \`Happy those weeping now -- because ye shall laugh.

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> \`Happy are ye when men shall hate you,
and when they shall separate you, and shall reproach, and shall cast
forth your name as evil, for the Son of Man's sake --

<span id="an_6:23">6:23</span> rejoice in that day, and leap, for lo,
your reward \[is\] great in the heaven, for according to these things
were their fathers doing to the prophets.

<span id="an_6:24">6:24</span> \`But wo to you -- the rich, because ye
have got your comfort.

<span id="an_6:25">6:25</span> \`Wo to you who have been filled --
because ye shall hunger. \`Wo to you who are laughing now -- because ye
shall mourn and weep.

<span id="an_6:26">6:26</span> \`Wo to you when all men shall speak well
of you -- for according to these things were their fathers doing to
false prophets.

<span id="an_6:27">6:27</span> \`But I say to you who are hearing, Love
your enemies, do good to those hating you,

<span id="an_6:28">6:28</span> bless those cursing you, and pray for
those accusing you falsely;

<span id="an_6:29">6:29</span> and to him smiting thee upon the cheek,
give also the other, and from him taking away from thee the mantle, also
the coat thou mayest not keep back.

<span id="an_6:30">6:30</span> \`And to every one who is asking of thee,
be giving; and from him who is taking away thy goods, be not asking
again;

<span id="an_6:31">6:31</span> and as ye wish that men may do to you, do
ye also to them in like manner;

<span id="an_6:32">6:32</span> and -- if ye love those loving you, what
grace have ye? for also the sinful love those loving them;

<span id="an_6:33">6:33</span> and if ye do good to those doing good to
you, what grace have ye? for also the sinful do the same;

<span id="an_6:34">6:34</span> and if ye lend \[to those\] of whom ye
hope to receive back, what grace have ye? for also the sinful lend to
sinners -- that they may receive again as much.

<span id="an_6:35">6:35</span> \`But love your enemies, and do good, and
lend, hoping for nothing again, and your reward will be great, and ye
shall be sons of the Highest, because He is kind unto the ungracious and
evil;

<span id="an_6:36">6:36</span> be ye therefore merciful, as also your
Father is merciful.

<span id="an_6:37">6:37</span> \`And judge not, and ye may not be
judged; condemn not, and ye may not be condemned; release, and ye shall
be released.

<span id="an_6:38">6:38</span> \`Give, and it shall be given to you;
good measure, pressed, and shaken, and running over, they shall give
into your bosom; for with that measure with which ye measure, it shall
be measured to you again.'

<span id="an_6:39">6:39</span> And he spake a simile to them, \`Is blind
able to lead blind? shall they not both fall into a pit?

<span id="an_6:40">6:40</span> A disciple is not above his teacher, but
every one perfected shall be as his teacher.

<span id="an_6:41">6:41</span> \`And why dost thou behold the mote that
is in thy brother's eye, and the beam that \[is\] in thine own eye dost
not consider?

<span id="an_6:42">6:42</span> or how art thou able to say to thy
brother, Brother, suffer, I may take out the mote that \[is\] in thine
eye -- thyself the beam in thine own eye not beholding? Hypocrite, take
first the beam out of thine own eye, and then thou shalt see clearly to
take out the mote that \[is\] in thy brother's eye.

<span id="an_6:43">6:43</span> \`For there is not a good tree making bad
fruit, nor a bad tree making good fruit;

<span id="an_6:44">6:44</span> for each tree from its own fruit is
known, for not from thorns do they gather figs, nor from a bramble do
they crop a grape.

<span id="an_6:45">6:45</span> \`The good man out of the good treasure
of his heart doth bring forth that which \[is\] good; and the evil man
out of the evil treasure of his heart doth bring forth that which \[is\]
evil; for out of the abounding of the heart doth his mouth speak.

<span id="an_6:46">6:46</span> \`And why do ye call me, Lord, Lord, and
do not what I say?

<span id="an_6:47">6:47</span> Every one who is coming unto me, and is
hearing my words, and is doing them, I will shew you to whom he is like;

<span id="an_6:48">6:48</span> he is like to a man building a house, who
did dig, and deepen, and laid a foundation upon the rock, and a flood
having come, the stream broke forth on that house, and was not able to
shake it, for it had been founded upon the rock.

<span id="an_6:49">6:49</span> \`And he who heard and did not, is like
to a man having builded a house upon the earth, without a foundation,
against which the stream brake forth, and immediately it fell, and the
ruin of that house became great.'

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> And when he completed all his sayings in
the ears of the people, he went into Capernaum;

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> and a certain centurion's servant being
ill, was about to die, who was much valued by him,

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> and having heard about Jesus, he sent unto
him elders of the Jews, beseeching him, that having come he might
thoroughly save his servant.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> And they, having come near unto Jesus, were
calling upon him earnestly, saying -- \`He is worthy to whom thou shalt
do this,

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> for he doth love our nation, and the
synagogue he did build to us.'

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> And Jesus was going on with them, and now
when he is not far distant from the house the centurion sent unto him
friends, saying to him, \`Sir, be not troubled, for I am not worthy that
under my roof thou mayest enter;

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> wherefore not even myself thought I worthy
to come unto thee, but say in a word, and my lad shall be healed;

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> for I also am a man placed under authority,
having under myself soldiers, and I say to this \[one\], Go, and he
goeth; and to another, Be coming, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do
this, and he doth \[it\].'

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> And having heard these things Jesus
wondered at him, and having turned to the multitude following him, he
said, \`I say to you, not even in Israel so much faith did I find;'

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> and those sent, having turned back to the
house, found the ailing servant in health.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> And it came to pass, on the morrow, he
was going on to a city called Nain, and there were going with him many
of his disciples, and a great multitude,

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> and as he came nigh to the gate of the
city, then, lo, one dead was being carried forth, an only son of his
mother, and she a widow, and a great multitude of the city was with her.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> And the Lord having seen her, was moved
with compassion towards her, and said to her, \`Be not weeping;'

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> and having come near, he touched the
bier, and those bearing \[it\] stood still, and he said, \`Young man, to
thee I say, Arise;'

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> and the dead sat up, and began to speak,
and he gave him to his mother;

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> and fear took hold of all, and they were
glorifying God, saying -- \`A great prophet hath risen among us,' and --
\`God did look upon His people.'

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> And the account of this went forth in all
Judea about him, and in all the region around.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> And the disciples of John told him about
all these things,

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> and John having called near a certain two
of his disciples, sent unto Jesus, saying, \`Art thou he who is coming,
or for another do we look?'

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> And having come near to him, the men
said, \`John the Baptist sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he who is
coming, or for another do we look?'

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> And in that hour he cured many from
sicknesses, and plagues, and evil spirits, and to many blind he granted
sight.

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> And Jesus answering said to them,
\`Having gone on, report to John what ye saw and heard, that blind men
do see again, lame do walk, lepers are cleansed, deaf do hear, dead are
raised, poor have good news proclaimed;

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> and happy is he whoever may not be
stumbled in me.'

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> And the messengers of John having gone
away, he began to say unto the multitudes concerning John: \`What have
ye gone forth to the wilderness to look on? a reed by the wind shaken?

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> but what have ye gone forth to see? a man
in soft garments clothed? lo, they in splendid apparellings, and living
in luxury, are in the houses of kings!

<span id="an_7:26">7:26</span> \`But what have ye gone forth to see? a
prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet:

<span id="an_7:27">7:27</span> this is he concerning whom it hath been
written, Lo, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy
way before thee;

<span id="an_7:28">7:28</span> for I say to you, a greater prophet,
among those born of women, than John the Baptist there is not; but the
least in the reign of God is greater than he.'

<span id="an_7:29">7:29</span> And all the people having heard, and the
tax-gatherers, declared God righteous, having been baptized with the
baptism of John,

<span id="an_7:30">7:30</span> but the Pharisees, and the lawyers, the
counsel of God did put away for themselves, not having been baptized by
him.

<span id="an_7:31">7:31</span> And the Lord said, \`To what, then, shall
I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?

<span id="an_7:32">7:32</span> they are like to children, to those
sitting in a market-place, and calling one to another, and saying, We
piped to you, and ye did not dance, we mourned to you, and ye did not
weep!

<span id="an_7:33">7:33</span> \`For John the Baptist came neither
eating bread nor drinking wine, and ye say, He hath a demon;

<span id="an_7:34">7:34</span> the Son of Man came eating and drinking,
and ye say, Lo, a man, a glutton, and a wine drinker, a friend of
tax-gatherers and sinners;

<span id="an_7:35">7:35</span> and the wisdom was justified from all her
children.'

<span id="an_7:36">7:36</span> And a certain one of the Pharisees was
asking him that he might eat with him, and having gone into the house of
the Pharisee he reclined (at meat),

<span id="an_7:37">7:37</span> and lo, a woman in the city, who was a
sinner, having known that he reclineth (at meat) in the house of the
Pharisee, having provided an alabaster box of ointment,

<span id="an_7:38">7:38</span> and having stood behind, beside his feet,
weeping, she began to wet his feet with the tears, and with the hairs of
her head she was wiping, and was kissing his feet, and was anointing
with the ointment.

<span id="an_7:39">7:39</span> And the Pharisee who did call him, having
seen, spake within himself, saying, \`This one, if he were a prophet,
would have known who and of what kind \[is\] the woman who doth touch
him, that she is a sinner.'

<span id="an_7:40">7:40</span> And Jesus answering said unto him,
\`Simon, I have something to say to thee;' and he saith, \`Teacher, say
on.'

<span id="an_7:41">7:41</span> \`Two debtors were to a certain creditor;
the one was owing five hundred denaries, and the other fifty;

<span id="an_7:42">7:42</span> and they not having \[wherewith\] to give
back, he forgave both; which then of them, say thou, will love him
more?'

<span id="an_7:43">7:43</span> And Simon answering said, \`I suppose
that to whom he forgave the more;' and he said to him, \`Rightly thou
didst judge.'

<span id="an_7:44">7:44</span> And having turned unto the woman, he said
to Simon, \`Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house; water for
my feet thou didst not give, but this woman with tears did wet my feet,
and with the hairs of her head did wipe;

<span id="an_7:45">7:45</span> a kiss to me thou didst not give, but
this woman, from what \[time\] I came in, did not cease kissing my feet;

<span id="an_7:46">7:46</span> with oil my head thou didst not anoint,
but this woman with ointment did anoint my feet;

<span id="an_7:47">7:47</span> therefore I say to thee, her many sins
have been forgiven, because she did love much; but to whom little is
forgiven, little he doth love.'

<span id="an_7:48">7:48</span> And he said to her, \`Thy sins have been
forgiven;'

<span id="an_7:49">7:49</span> and those reclining with him (at meat)
began to say within themselves, \`Who is this, who also doth forgive
sins?'

<span id="an_7:50">7:50</span> and he said unto the woman, \`Thy faith
have saved thee, be going on to peace.'

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> And it came to pass thereafter, that he was
going through every city and village, preaching and proclaiming good
news of the reign of God, and the twelve \[are\] with him,

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> and certain women, who were healed of evil
spirits and infirmities, Mary who is called Magdalene, from whom seven
demons had gone forth,

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> and Joanna wife of Chuza, steward of Herod,
and Susanna, and many others, who were ministering to him from their
substance.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> And a great multitude having gathered, and
those who from city and city were coming unto him, he spake by a simile:

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> \`The sower went forth to sow his seed, and
in his sowing some indeed fell beside the way, and it was trodden down,
and the fowls of the heaven did devour it.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> \`And other fell upon the rock, and having
sprung up, it did wither, through not having moisture.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> \`And other fell amidst the thorns, and the
thorns having sprung up with it, did choke it.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> \`And other fell upon the good ground, and
having sprung up, it made fruit an hundred fold.' These things saying,
he was calling, \`He having ears to hear -- let him hear.'

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> And his disciples were questioning him,
saying, \`What may this simile be?'

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> And he said, \`To you it hath been given
to know the secrets of the reign of God, and to the rest in similes;
that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> \`And this is the simile: The seed is the
word of God,

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> and those beside the way are those
hearing, then cometh the Devil, and taketh up the word from their heart,
lest having believed, they may be saved.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> \`And those upon the rock: They who, when
they may hear, with joy do receive the word, and these have no root, who
for a time believe, and in time of temptation fall away.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> \`And that which fell to the thorns:
These are they who have heard, and going forth, through anxieties, and
riches, and pleasures of life, are choked, and bear not to completion.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> \`And that in the good ground: These are
they, who in an upright and good heart, having heard the word, do retain
\[it\], and bear fruit in continuance.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> \`And no one having lighted a lamp doth
cover it with a vessel, or under a couch doth put \[it\]; but upon a
lamp-stand he doth put \[it\], that those coming in may see the light,

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> for nothing is secret, that shall not
become manifest, nor hid, that shall not be known, and become manifest.

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> \`See, therefore, how ye hear, for
whoever may have, there shall be given to him, and whoever may not have,
also what he seemeth to have, shall be taken from him.'

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> And there came unto him his mother and
brethren, and they were not able to get to him because of the multitude,

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> and it was told him, saying, \`Thy mother
and thy brethren do stand without, wishing to see thee;'

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> and he answering said unto them, \`My
mother and my brethren! they are those who the word of God are hearing,
and doing.'

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> And it came to pass, on one of the days,
that he himself went into a boat with his disciples, and he said unto
them, \`We may go over to the other side of the lake;' and they set
forth,

<span id="an_8:23">8:23</span> and as they are sailing he fell deeply
asleep, and there came down a storm of wind to the lake, and they were
filling, and were in peril.

<span id="an_8:24">8:24</span> And having come near, they awoke him,
saying, \`Master, master, we perish;' and he, having arisen, rebuked the
wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and there came a
calm,

<span id="an_8:25">8:25</span> and he said to them, \`Where is your
faith?' and they being afraid did wonder, saying unto one another,
\`Who, then, is this, that even the winds he doth command, and the
water, and they obey him?'

<span id="an_8:26">8:26</span> And they sailed down to the region of the
Gadarenes, that is over-against Galilee,

<span id="an_8:27">8:27</span> and he having gone forth upon the land,
there met him a certain man, out of the city, who had demons for a long
time, and with a garment was not clothed, and in a house was not
abiding, but in the tombs,

<span id="an_8:28">8:28</span> and having seen Jesus, and having cried
out, he fell before him, and with a loud voice, said, \`What -- to me
and to thee, Jesus, Son of God Most High? I beseech thee, mayest thou
not afflict me!'

<span id="an_8:29">8:29</span> For he commanded the unclean spirit to
come forth from the man, for many times it had caught him, and he was
being bound with chains and fetters -- guarded, and breaking asunder the
bonds he was driven by the demons to the deserts.

<span id="an_8:30">8:30</span> And Jesus questioned him, saying, \`What
is thy name?' and he said, \`Legion,' (because many demons were entered
into him,)

<span id="an_8:31">8:31</span> and he was calling on him, that he may
not command them to go away to the abyss,

<span id="an_8:32">8:32</span> and there was there a herd of many swine
feeding in the mountain, and they were calling on him, that he might
suffer them to enter into these, and he suffered them,

<span id="an_8:33">8:33</span> and the demons having gone forth from the
man, did enter into the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep to the
lake, and were choked.

<span id="an_8:34">8:34</span> And those feeding \[them\], having seen
what was come to pass, fled, and having gone, told \[it\] to the city,
and to the fields;

<span id="an_8:35">8:35</span> and they came forth to see what was come
to pass, and they came unto Jesus, and found the man sitting, out of
whom the demons had gone forth, clothed, and right-minded, at the feet
of Jesus, and they were afraid;

<span id="an_8:36">8:36</span> and those also having seen \[it\], told
them how the demoniac was saved.

<span id="an_8:37">8:37</span> And the whole multitude of the region of
the Gadarenes round about asked him to go away from them, because with
great fear they were pressed, and he having entered into the boat, did
turn back.

<span id="an_8:38">8:38</span> And the man from whom the demons had gone
forth was beseeching of him to be with him, and Jesus sent him away,
saying,

<span id="an_8:39">8:39</span> \`Turn back to thy house, and tell how
great things God did to thee;' and he went away through all the city
proclaiming how great things Jesus did to him.

<span id="an_8:40">8:40</span> And it came to pass, in the turning back
of Jesus, the multitude received him, for they were all looking for him,

<span id="an_8:41">8:41</span> and lo, there came a man, whose name
\[is\] Jairus, and he was a chief of the synagogue, and having fallen at
the feet of Jesus, was calling on him to come to his house;

<span id="an_8:42">8:42</span> because he had an only daughter about
twelve years \[old\], and she was dying. And in his going away, the
multitudes were thronging him,

<span id="an_8:43">8:43</span> and a woman, having an issue of blood for
twelve years, who, having spent on physicians all her living, was not
able to be healed by any,

<span id="an_8:44">8:44</span> having come near behind, touched the
fringe of his garment, and presently the issue of her blood stood.

<span id="an_8:45">8:45</span> And Jesus said, \`Who \[is\] it that
touched me?' and all denying, Peter and those with him said, \`Master,
the multitudes press thee, and throng \[thee\], and thou dost say, Who
\[is\] it that touched me!'

<span id="an_8:46">8:46</span> And Jesus said, \`Some one did touch me,
for I knew power having gone forth from me.'

<span id="an_8:47">8:47</span> And the woman, having seen that she was
not hid, trembling, came, and having fallen before him, for what cause
she touched him declared to him before all the people, and how she was
healed presently;

<span id="an_8:48">8:48</span> and he said to her, \`Take courage,
daughter, thy faith hath saved thee, be going on to peace.'

<span id="an_8:49">8:49</span> While he is yet speaking, there doth come
a certain one from the chief of the synagogue's \[house\], saying to him
-- \`Thy daughter hath died, harass not the Teacher;'

<span id="an_8:50">8:50</span> and Jesus having heard, answered him,
saying, \`Be not afraid, only believe, and she shall be saved.'

<span id="an_8:51">8:51</span> And having come to the house, he suffered
no one to go in, except Peter, and James, and John, and the father of
the child, and the mother;

<span id="an_8:52">8:52</span> and they were all weeping, and beating
themselves for her, and he said, \`Weep not, she did not die, but doth
sleep;

<span id="an_8:53">8:53</span> and they were deriding him, knowing that
she did die;

<span id="an_8:54">8:54</span> and he having put all forth without, and
having taken hold of her hand, called, saying, \`Child, arise;'

<span id="an_8:55">8:55</span> and her spirit came back, and she arose
presently, and he directed that there be given to her to eat;

<span id="an_8:56">8:56</span> and her parents were amazed, but he
charged them to say to no one what was come to pass.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> And having called together his twelve
disciples, he gave them power and authority over all the demons, and to
cure sicknesses,

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> and he sent them to proclaim the reign of
God, and to heal the ailing.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> And he said unto them, \`Take nothing for
the way, neither staff, nor scrip, nor bread, nor money; neither have
two coats each;

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> and into whatever house ye may enter, there
remain, and thence depart;

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> and as many as may not receive you, going
forth from that city, even the dust from your feet shake off, for a
testimony against them.'

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> And going forth they were going through the
several villages, proclaiming good news, and healing everywhere.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> And Herod the tetrarch heard of all the
things being done by him, and was perplexed, because it was said by
certain, that John hath been raised out of the dead;

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> and by certain, that Elijah did appear, and
by others, that a prophet, one of the ancients, was risen;

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> and Herod said, \`John I did behead, but
who is this concerning whom I hear such things?' and he was seeking to
see him.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> And the apostles having turned back,
declared to him how great things they did, and having taken them, he
withdrew by himself to a desert place of a city called Bethsaida,

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> and the multitudes having known did
follow him, and having received them, he was speaking to them concerning
the reign of God, and those having need of service he cured.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> And the day began to decline, and the
twelve having come near, said to him, \`Let away the multitude, that
having gone to the villages and the fields round about, they may lodge
and may find provision, because here we are in a desert place.'

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> And he said unto them, \`Give ye them to
eat;' and they said, \`We have no more than five loaves, and two fishes:
except, having gone, we may buy for all this people victuals;'

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> for they were about five thousand men.
And he said unto his disciples, \`Cause them to recline in companies, in
each fifty;'

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> and they did so, and made all to recline;

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> and having taken the five loaves, and the
two fishes, having looked up to the heaven, he blessed them, and brake,
and was giving to the disciples to set before the multitude;

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> and they did eat, and were all filled,
and there was taken up what was over to them of broken pieces, twelve
baskets.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> And it came to pass, as he is praying
alone, the disciples were with him, and he questioned them, saying,
\`Who do the multitudes say me to be?'

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> And they answering said, \`John the
Baptist; and others, Elijah; and others, that a prophet, one of the
ancients, was risen;'

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> and he said to them, \`And ye -- who do
ye say me to be?' and Peter answering said, \`The Christ of God.'

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> And having charged them, he commanded
\[them\] to say this to no one,

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> saying -- \`It behoveth the Son of Man to
suffer many things, and to be rejected by the elders, and chief priests,
and scribes, and to be killed, and the third day to be raised.'

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> And he said unto all, \`If any one doth
will to come after me, let him disown himself, and take up his cross
daily, and follow me;

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> for whoever may will to save his life,
shall lose it, and whoever may lose his life for my sake, he shall save
it;

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> for what is a man profited, having gained
the whole world, and having lost or having forfeited himself?

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> \`For whoever may be ashamed of me, and
of my words, of this one shall the Son of Man be ashamed, when he may
come in his glory, and the Father's, and the holy messengers';

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> and I say to you, truly, there are
certain of those here standing, who shall not taste of death till they
may see the reign of God.'

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> And it came to pass, after these words,
as it were eight days, that having taken Peter, and John, and James, he
went up to the mountain to pray,

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> and it came to pass, in his praying, the
appearance of his face became altered, and his garment white --
sparkling.

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> And lo, two men were speaking together
with him, who were Moses and Elijah,

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> who having appeared in glory, spake of
his outgoing that he was about to fulfil in Jerusalem,

<span id="an_9:32">9:32</span> but Peter and those with him were heavy
with sleep, and having waked, they saw his glory, and the two men
standing with him.

<span id="an_9:33">9:33</span> And it came to pass, in their parting
from him, Peter said unto Jesus, \`Master, it is good to us to be here;
and we may make three booths, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one
for Elijah,' not knowing what he saith:

<span id="an_9:34">9:34</span> and as he was speaking these things,
there came a cloud, and overshadowed them, and they feared in their
entering into the cloud,

<span id="an_9:35">9:35</span> and a voice came out of the cloud saying,
\`This is My Son -- the Beloved; hear ye him;'

<span id="an_9:36">9:36</span> and when the voice was past, Jesus was
found alone; and they were silent, and declared to no one in those days
anything of what they have seen.

<span id="an_9:37">9:37</span> And it came to pass on the next day, they
having come down from the mount, there met him a great multitude,

<span id="an_9:38">9:38</span> and lo, a man from the multitude cried
out, saying, \`Teacher, I beseech thee, look upon my son, because he is
my only begotten;

<span id="an_9:39">9:39</span> and lo, a spirit doth take him, and
suddenly he doth cry out, and it teareth him, with foaming, and it
hardly departeth from him, bruising him,

<span id="an_9:40">9:40</span> and I besought thy disciples that they
might cast it out, and they were not able.'

<span id="an_9:41">9:41</span> And Jesus answering said, \`O generation,
unstedfast and perverse, till when shall I be with you, and suffer you?
bring near hither thy son;'

<span id="an_9:42">9:42</span> and as he is yet coming near, the demon
rent him, and tore \[him\] sore, and Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit,
and healed the youth, and gave him back to his father.

<span id="an_9:43">9:43</span> And they were all amazed at the greatness
of God, and while all are wondering at all things that Jesus did, he
said unto his disciples,

<span id="an_9:44">9:44</span> \`Lay ye to your ears these words, for
the Son of Man is about to be delivered up to the hands of men.'

<span id="an_9:45">9:45</span> And they were not knowing this saying,
and it was veiled from them, that they might not perceive it, and they
were afraid to ask him about this saying.

<span id="an_9:46">9:46</span> And there entered a reasoning among them,
this, Who may be greater of them?

<span id="an_9:47">9:47</span> and Jesus having seen the reasoning of
their heart, having taken hold of a child, set him beside himself,

<span id="an_9:48">9:48</span> and said to them, \`Whoever may receive
this child in my name, doth receive me, and whoever may receive me, doth
receive Him who sent me, for he who is least among you all -- he shall
be great.'

<span id="an_9:49">9:49</span> And John answering said, \`Master, we saw
a certain one in thy name casting forth the demons, and we forbade him,
because he doth not follow with us;'

<span id="an_9:50">9:50</span> and Jesus said unto him, \`Forbid not,
for he who is not against us, is for us.'

<span id="an_9:51">9:51</span> And it came to pass, in the completing of
the days of his being taken up, that he fixed his face to go on to
Jerusalem,

<span id="an_9:52">9:52</span> and he sent messengers before his face,
and having gone on, they went into a village of Samaritans, to make
ready for him,

<span id="an_9:53">9:53</span> and they did not receive him, because his
face was going on to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_9:54">9:54</span> And his disciples James and John having
seen, said, \`Sir, wilt thou \[that\] we may command fire to come down
from the heaven, and to consume them, as also Elijah did?'

<span id="an_9:55">9:55</span> and having turned, he rebuked them, and
said, \`Ye have not known of what spirit ye are;

<span id="an_9:56">9:56</span> for the Son of Man did not come to
destroy men's lives, but to save;' and they went on to another village.

<span id="an_9:57">9:57</span> And it came to pass, as they are going on
in the way, a certain one said unto him, \`I will follow thee wherever
thou mayest go, sir;'

<span id="an_9:58">9:58</span> and Jesus said to him, \`The foxes have
holes, and the fowls of the heaven places of rest, but the Son of Man
hath not where he may recline the head.'

<span id="an_9:59">9:59</span> And he said unto another, \`Be following
me;' and he said, \`Sir, permit me, having gone away, first to bury my
father;'

<span id="an_9:60">9:60</span> and Jesus said to him, \`Suffer the dead
to bury their own dead, and thou, having gone away, publish the reign of
God.'

<span id="an_9:61">9:61</span> And another also said, \`I will follow
thee, sir, but first permit me to take leave of those in my house;'

<span id="an_9:62">9:62</span> and Jesus said unto him, \`No one having
put his hand on a plough, and looking back, is fit for the reign of
God.'

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> And after these things, the Lord did
appoint also other seventy, and sent them by twos before his face, to
every city and place whither he himself was about to come,

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> then said he unto them, \`The harvest
indeed \[is\] abundant, but the workmen few; beseech ye then the Lord of
the harvest, that He may put forth workmen to His harvest.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> \`Go away; lo, I send you forth as lambs
in the midst of wolves;

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> carry no bag, no scrip, nor sandals; and
salute no one on the way;

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> and into whatever house ye do enter,
first say, Peace to this house;

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> and if indeed there may be there the son
of peace, rest on it shall your peace; and if not so, upon you it shall
turn back.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> \`And in that house remain, eating and
drinking the things they have, for worthy \[is\] the workman of his
hire; go not from house to house,

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> and into whatever city ye enter, and they
may receive you, eat the things set before you,

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> and heal the ailing in it, and say to
them, The reign of God hath come nigh to you.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> \`And into whatever city ye do enter,
and they may not receive you, having gone forth to its broad places,
say,

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> And the dust that hath cleaved to us,
from your city, we do wipe off against you, but this know ye, that the
reign of God hath come nigh to you;

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> and I say to you, that for Sodom in
that day it shall be more tolerable than for that city.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> \`Wo to thee, Chorazin; wo to thee,
Bethsaida; for if in Tyre and Sidon had been done the mighty works that
were done in you, long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes, they had
reformed;

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> but for Tyre and Sidon it shall be more
tolerable in the judgment than for you.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> \`And thou, Capernaum, which unto the
heaven wast exalted, unto hades thou shalt be brought down.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> \`He who is hearing you, doth hear me;
and he who is putting you away, doth put me away; and he who is putting
me away, doth put away Him who sent me.'

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> And the seventy turned back with joy,
saying, \`Sir, and the demons are being subjected to us in thy name;'

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> and he said to them, \`I was beholding
the Adversary, as lightning from the heaven having fallen;

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> lo, I give to you the authority to
tread upon serpents and scorpions, and on all the power of the enemy,
and nothing by any means shall hurt you;

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> but, in this rejoice not, that the
spirits are subjected to you, but rejoice rather that your names were
written in the heavens.'

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> In that hour was Jesus glad in the
Spirit, and said, \`I do confess to thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and
of the earth, that Thou didst hide these things from wise men and
understanding, and didst reveal them to babes; yes, Father, because so
it became good pleasure before Thee.

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> \`All things were delivered up to me by
my Father, and no one doth know who the Son is, except the Father, and
who the Father is, except the Son, and he to whom the Son may wish to
reveal \[Him\].'

<span id="an_10:23">10:23</span> And having turned unto the disciples,
he said, by themselves, \`Happy the eyes that are perceiving what ye
perceive;

<span id="an_10:24">10:24</span> for I say to you, that many prophets
and kings did wish to see what ye perceive, and did not see, and to hear
what ye hear, and did not hear.'

<span id="an_10:25">10:25</span> And lo, a certain lawyer stood up,
trying him, and saying, \`Teacher, what having done, life age-during
shall I inherit?'

<span id="an_10:26">10:26</span> And he said unto him, \`In the law what
hath been written? how dost thou read?'

<span id="an_10:27">10:27</span> And he answering said, \`Thou shalt
love the Lord thy God out of all thy heart, and out of all thy soul, and
out of all thy strength, and out of all thy understanding, and thy
neighbour as thyself.'

<span id="an_10:28">10:28</span> And he said to him, \`Rightly thou
didst answer; this do, and thou shalt live.'

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> And he, willing to declare himself
righteous, said unto Jesus, \`And who is my neighbour?'

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> and Jesus having taken up \[the word\],
said, \`A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell
among robbers, and having stripped him and inflicted blows, they went
away, leaving \[him\] half dead.

<span id="an_10:31">10:31</span> \`And by a coincidence a certain priest
was going down in that way, and having seen him, he passed over on the
opposite side;

<span id="an_10:32">10:32</span> and in like manner also, a Levite,
having been about the place, having come and seen, passed over on the
opposite side.

<span id="an_10:33">10:33</span> \`But a certain Samaritan, journeying,
came along him, and having seen him, he was moved with compassion,

<span id="an_10:34">10:34</span> and having come near, he bound up his
wounds, pouring on oil and wine, and having lifted him up on his own
beast, he brought him to an inn, and was careful of him;

<span id="an_10:35">10:35</span> and on the morrow, going forth, taking
out two denaries, he gave to the innkeeper, and said to him, Be careful
of him, and whatever thou mayest spend more, I, in my coming again, will
give back to thee.

<span id="an_10:36">10:36</span> \`Who, then, of these three, seemeth to
thee to have become neighbour of him who fell among the robbers?'

<span id="an_10:37">10:37</span> and he said, \`He who did the kindness
with him,' then Jesus said to him, \`Be going on, and thou be doing in
like manner.'

<span id="an_10:38">10:38</span> And it came to pass, in their going on,
that he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman, by name
Martha, did receive him into her house,

<span id="an_10:39">10:39</span> and she had also a sister, called Mary,
who also, having seated herself beside the feet of Jesus, was hearing
the word,

<span id="an_10:40">10:40</span> and Martha was distracted about much
serving, and having stood by him, she said, \`Sir, dost thou not care
that my sister left me alone to serve? say then to her, that she may
partake along with me.'

<span id="an_10:41">10:41</span> And Jesus answering said to her,
\`Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and disquieted about many things,

<span id="an_10:42">10:42</span> but of one thing there is need, and
Mary the good part did choose, that shall not be taken away from her.'

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> And it came to pass, in his being in a
certain place praying, as he ceased, a certain one of his disciples said
unto him, \`Sir, teach us to pray, as also John taught his disciples.'

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> And he said to them, \`When ye may pray,
say ye: Our Father who art in the heavens; hallowed be Thy name: Thy
reign come; Thy will come to pass, as in heaven also on earth;

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> our appointed bread be giving us daily;

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> and forgive us our sins, for also we
ourselves forgive every one indebted to us; and mayest Thou not bring us
into temptation; but do Thou deliver us from the evil.'

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> And he said unto them, \`Who of you shall
have a friend, and shall go on unto him at midnight, and may say to him,
Friend, lend me three loaves,

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> seeing a friend of mine came out of the
way unto me, and I have not what I shall set before him,

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> and he from within answering may say, Do
not give me trouble, already the door hath been shut, and my children
with me are in the bed, I am not able, having risen, to give to thee.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> \`I say to you, even if he will not give
to him, having risen, because of his being his friend, yet because of
his importunity, having risen, he will give him as many as he doth need;

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> and I say to you, Ask, and it shall be
given to you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to
you;

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> for every one who is asking doth
receive; and he who is seeking doth find; and to him who is knocking it
shall be opened.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> \`And of which of you -- the father --
if the son shall ask a loaf, a stone will he present to him? and if a
fish, will he instead of a fish, a serpent present to him?

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> and if he may ask an egg, will he
present to him a scorpion?

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> If, then, ye, being evil, have known
good gifts to be giving to your children, how much more shall the Father
who is from heaven give the Holy Spirit to those asking Him!'

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> And he was casting forth a demon, and
it was dumb, and it came to pass, the demon having gone forth, the dumb
man spake, and the multitudes wondered,

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> and certain of them said, \`By
Beelzeboul, ruler of the demons, he doth cast forth the demons;'

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> and others, tempting, a sign out of
heaven from him were asking.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> And he, knowing their thoughts, said to
them, \`Every kingdom having been divided against itself is desolated;
and house against house doth fall;

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> and if also the Adversary against
himself was divided, how shall his kingdom be made to stand? for ye say,
by Beelzeboul is my casting forth the demons.

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> \`But if I by Beelzeboul cast forth the
demons -- your sons, by whom do they cast forth? because of this your
judges they shall be;

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> but if by the finger of God I cast
forth the demons, then come unawares upon you did the reign of God.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> \`When the strong man armed may keep
his hall, in peace are his goods;

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> but when the stronger than he, having
come upon \[him\], may overcome him, his whole-armour he doth take away
in which he had trusted, and his spoils he distributeth;

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> he who is not with me is against me,
and he who is not gathering with me doth scatter.

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> \`When the unclean spirit may go forth
from the man it walketh through waterless places seeking rest, and not
finding, it saith, I will turn back to my house whence I came forth;

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> and having come, it findeth \[it\]
swept and adorned;

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> then doth it go, and take to it seven
other spirits more evil than itself, and having entered, they dwell
there, and the last of that man becometh worst than the first.'

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> And it came to pass, in his saying
these things, a certain woman having lifted up the voice out of the
multitude, said to him, \`Happy the womb that carried thee, and the paps
that thou didst suck!'

<span id="an_11:28">11:28</span> And he said, \`Yea, rather, happy those
hearing the word of God, and keeping \[it\]!'

<span id="an_11:29">11:29</span> And the multitudes crowding together
upon him, he began to say, \`This generation is evil, a sign it doth
seek after, and a sign shall not be given to it, except the sign of
Jonah the prophet,

<span id="an_11:30">11:30</span> for as Jonah became a sign to the
Ninevites, so also shall the Son of Man be to this generation.

<span id="an_11:31">11:31</span> \`A queen of the south shall rise up in
the judgment with the men of this generation, and shall condemn them,
because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of
Solomon; and lo, greater than Solomon here!

<span id="an_11:32">11:32</span> \`Men of Nineveh shall stand up in the
judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it, because they
reformed at the proclamation of Jonah; and lo, greater than Jonah here!

<span id="an_11:33">11:33</span> \`And no one having lighted a lamp,
doth put \[it\] in a secret place, nor under the measure, but on the
lamp-stand, that those coming in may behold the light.

<span id="an_11:34">11:34</span> \`The lamp of the body is the eye, when
then thine eye may be simple, thy whole body also is lightened; and when
it may be evil, thy body also is darkened;

<span id="an_11:35">11:35</span> take heed, then, lest the light that
\[is\] in thee be darkness;

<span id="an_11:36">11:36</span> if then thy whole body is lightened,
not having any part darkened, the whole shall be lightened, as when the
lamp by the brightness may give thee light.'

<span id="an_11:37">11:37</span> And in \[his\] speaking, a certain
Pharisee was asking him that he might dine with him, and having gone in,
he reclined (at meat),

<span id="an_11:38">11:38</span> and the Pharisee having seen, did
wonder that he did not first baptize himself before the dinner.

<span id="an_11:39">11:39</span> And the Lord said unto him, \`Now do
ye, the Pharisees, the outside of the cup and of the plate make clean,
but your inward part is full of rapine and wickedness;

<span id="an_11:40">11:40</span> unthinking! did not He who made the
outside also the inside make?

<span id="an_11:41">11:41</span> But what ye have give ye \[as\] alms,
and, lo, all things are clean to you.

<span id="an_11:42">11:42</span> \`But wo to you, the Pharisees, because
ye tithe the mint, and the rue, and every herb, and ye pass by the
judgment, and the love of God; these things it behoveth to do, and those
not to be neglecting.

<span id="an_11:43">11:43</span> \`Wo to you, the Pharisees, because ye
love the first seats in the synagogues, and the salutations in the
market-places.

<span id="an_11:44">11:44</span> \`Wo to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites, because ye are as the unseen tombs, and the men walking
above have not known.'

<span id="an_11:45">11:45</span> And one of the lawyers answering, saith
to him, \`Teacher, these things saying, us also thou dost insult;'

<span id="an_11:46">11:46</span> and he said, \`And to you, the lawyers,
wo! because ye burden men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye
yourselves with one of your fingers do not touch the burdens.

<span id="an_11:47">11:47</span> \`Wo to you, because ye build the tombs
of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.

<span id="an_11:48">11:48</span> Then do ye testify, and are well
pleased with the works of your fathers, because they indeed killed them,
and ye do build their tombs;

<span id="an_11:49">11:49</span> because of this also the wisdom of God
said: I will send to them prophets, and apostles, and some of them they
shall kill and persecute,

<span id="an_11:50">11:50</span> that the blood of all the prophets,
that is being poured forth from the foundation of the world, may be
required from this generation;

<span id="an_11:51">11:51</span> from the blood of Abel unto the blood
of Zacharias, who perished between the altar and the house; yes, I say
to you, It shall be required from this generation.

<span id="an_11:52">11:52</span> \`Wo to you, the lawyers, because ye
took away the key of the knowledge; yourselves ye did not enter; and
those coming in, ye did hinder.'

<span id="an_11:53">11:53</span> And in his speaking these things unto
them, the scribes and the Pharisees began fearfully to urge and to press
him to speak about many things,

<span id="an_11:54">11:54</span> laying wait for him, and seeking to
catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> At which time the myriads of the
multitude having been gathered together, so as to tread upon one
another, he began to say unto his disciples, first, \`Take heed to
yourselves of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy;

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> and there is nothing covered, that shall
not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known;

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> because whatever in the darkness ye said,
in the light shall be heard: and what to the ear ye spake in the
inner-chambers, shall be proclaimed upon the house-tops.

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> \`And I say to you, my friends, be not
afraid of those killing the body, and after these things are not having
anything over to do;

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> but I will show to you, whom ye may fear;
Fear him who, after the killing, is having authority to cast to the
gehenna; yes, I say to you, Fear ye Him.

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> \`Are not five sparrows sold for two
assars? and one of them is not forgotten before God,

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> but even the hairs of your head have been
all numbered; therefore fear ye not, than many sparrows ye are of more
value.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> \`And I say to you, Every one -- whoever
may confess with me before men, the Son of Man also shall confess with
him before the messengers of God,

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> and he who hath denied me before men,
shall be denied before the messengers of God,

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> and every one whoever shall say a word
to the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven to him, but to him who to the
Holy Spirit did speak evil, it shall not be forgiven.

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> \`And when they bring you before the
synagogues, and the rulers, and the authorities, be not anxious how or
what ye may reply, or what ye may say,

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in
that hour what it behoveth \[you\] to say.'

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> And a certain one said to him, out of
the multitude, \`Teacher, say to my brother to divide with me the
inheritance.'

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> And he said to him, \`Man, who set me a
judge or a divider over you?'

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> And he said unto them, \`Observe, and
beware of the covetousness, because not in the abundance of one's goods
is his life.'

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> And he spake a simile unto them,
saying, \`Of a certain rich man the field brought forth well;

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> and he was reasoning within himself,
saying, What shall I do, because I have not where I shall gather
together my fruits?

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> and he said, This I will do, I will
take down my storehouses, and greater ones I will build, and I will
gather together there all my products and my good things,

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> and I will say to my soul, Soul, thou
hast many good things laid up for many years, be resting, eat, drink, be
merry.

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> \`And God said to him, Unthinking one!
this night thy soul they shall require from thee, and what things thou
didst prepare -- to whom shall they be?

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> so \[is\] he who is treasuring up to
himself, and is not rich toward God.'

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> And he said unto his disciples,
\`Because of this, to you I say, Be not anxious for your life, what ye
may eat; nor for the body, what ye may put on;

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> the life is more than the nourishment,
and the body than the clothing.

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> \`Consider the ravens, that they sow
not, nor reap, to which there is no barn nor storehouse, and God doth
nourish them; how much better are ye than the fowls?

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> and who of you, being anxious, is able
to add to his age one cubit?

<span id="an_12:26">12:26</span> If, then, ye are not able for the least
-- why for the rest are ye anxious?

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> \`Consider the lilies, how do they
grow? they labour not, nor do they spin, and I say to you, not even
Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these;

<span id="an_12:28">12:28</span> and if the herbage in the field, that
to-day is, and to-morrow into an oven is cast, God doth so clothe, how
much more you -- ye of little faith?

<span id="an_12:29">12:29</span> \`And ye -- seek not what ye may eat,
or what ye may drink, and be not in suspense,

<span id="an_12:30">12:30</span> for all these things do the nations of
the world seek after, and your Father hath known that ye have need of
these things;

<span id="an_12:31">12:31</span> but, seek ye the reign of God, and all
these things shall be added to you.

<span id="an_12:32">12:32</span> \`Fear not, little flock, because your
Father did delight to give you the reign;

<span id="an_12:33">12:33</span> sell your goods, and give alms, make to
yourselves bags that become not old, a treasure unfailing in the
heavens, where thief doth not come near, nor moth destroy;

<span id="an_12:34">12:34</span> for where your treasure is, there also
your heart will be.

<span id="an_12:35">12:35</span> \`Let your loins be girded, and the
lamps burning,

<span id="an_12:36">12:36</span> and ye like to men waiting for their
lord, when he shall return out of the wedding feasts, that he having
come and knocked, immediately they may open to him.

<span id="an_12:37">12:37</span> \`Happy those servants, whom the lord,
having come, shall find watching; verily I say to you, that he will gird
himself, and will cause them to recline (at meat), and having come near,
will minister to them;

<span id="an_12:38">12:38</span> and if he may come in the second watch,
and in the third watch he may come, and may find \[it\] so, happy are
those servants.

<span id="an_12:39">12:39</span> \`And this know, that if the master of
the house had known what hour the thief doth come, he would have
watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken through;

<span id="an_12:40">12:40</span> and ye, then, become ye ready, because
at the hour ye think not, the Son of Man doth come.'

<span id="an_12:41">12:41</span> And Peter said to him, \`Sir, unto us
this simile dost thou speak, or also unto all?'

<span id="an_12:42">12:42</span> And the Lord said, \`Who, then, is the
faithful and prudent steward whom the lord shall set over his household,
to give in season the wheat measure?

<span id="an_12:43">12:43</span> Happy that servant, whom his lord,
having come, shall find doing so;

<span id="an_12:44">12:44</span> truly I say to you, that over all his
goods he will set him.

<span id="an_12:45">12:45</span> \`And if that servant may say in his
heart, My lord doth delay to come, and may begin to beat the
men-servants and the maid-servants, to eat also, and to drink, and to be
drunken;

<span id="an_12:46">12:46</span> the lord of that servant will come in a
day in which he doth not look for \[him\], and in an hour that he doth
not know, and will cut him off, and his portion with the unfaithful he
will appoint.

<span id="an_12:47">12:47</span> \`And that servant, who having known
his lord's will, and not having prepared, nor having gone according to
his will, shall be beaten with many stripes,

<span id="an_12:48">12:48</span> and he who, not having known, and
having done things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few; and to
every one to whom much was given, much shall be required from him; and
to whom they did commit much, more abundantly they will ask of him.

<span id="an_12:49">12:49</span> \`Fire I came to cast to the earth, and
what will I if already it was kindled?

<span id="an_12:50">12:50</span> but I have a baptism to be baptized
with, and how am I pressed till it may be completed!

<span id="an_12:51">12:51</span> \`Think ye that peace I came to give in
the earth? no, I say to you, but rather division;

<span id="an_12:52">12:52</span> for there shall be henceforth five in
one house divided -- three against two, and two against three;

<span id="an_12:53">12:53</span> a father shall be divided against a
son, and a son against a father, a mother against a daughter, and a
daughter against a mother, a mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law,
and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.'

<span id="an_12:54">12:54</span> And he said also to the multitudes,
\`When ye may see the cloud rising from the west, immediately ye say, A
shower doth come, and it is so;

<span id="an_12:55">12:55</span> and when -- a south wind blowing, ye
say, that there will be heat, and it is;

<span id="an_12:56">12:56</span> hypocrites! the face of the earth and
of the heaven ye have known to make proof of, but this time -- how do ye
not make proof of \[it\]?

<span id="an_12:57">12:57</span> \`And why, also, of yourselves, judge
ye not what is righteous?

<span id="an_12:58">12:58</span> for, as thou art going away with thy
opponent to the ruler, in the way give diligence to be released from
him, lest he may drag thee unto the judge, and the judge may deliver
thee to the officer, and the officer may cast thee into prison;

<span id="an_12:59">12:59</span> I say to thee, thou mayest not come
forth thence till even the last mite thou mayest give back.'

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> And there were present certain at that
time, telling him about the Galileans, whose blood Pilate did mingle
with their sacrifices;

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> and Jesus answering said to them, \`Think
ye that these Galileans became sinners beyond all the Galileans, because
they have suffered such things?

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> No -- I say to you, but, if ye may not
reform, all ye even so shall perish.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> \`Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in
Siloam fell, and killed them; think ye that these became debtors beyond
all men who are dwelling in Jerusalem?

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> No -- I say to you, but, if ye may not
reform, all ye in like manner shall perish.'

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> And he spake this simile: \`A certain one
had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit in it,
and he did not find;

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> and he said unto the vine-dresser, Lo,
three years I come seeking fruit in this fig-tree, and do not find, cut
it off, why also the ground doth it render useless?

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> \`And he answering saith to him, Sir,
suffer it also this year, till that I may dig about it, and cast in
dung;

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> and if indeed it may bear fruit --; and
if not so, thereafter thou shalt cut it off.'

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> And he was teaching in one of the
synagogues on the sabbath,

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> and lo, there was a woman having a
spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bowed together, and not
able to bend back at all,

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> and Jesus having seen her, did call
\[her\] near, and said to her, \`Woman, thou hast been loosed from thy
infirmity;'

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> and he laid on her \[his\] hands, and
presently she was set upright, and was glorifying God.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> And the chief of the synagogue
answering -- much displeased that on the sabbath Jesus healed -- said to
the multitude, \`Six days there are in which it behoveth \[us\] to be
working; in these, then, coming, be healed, and not on the sabbath-day.'

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> Then the Lord answered him and said,
\`Hypocrite, doth not each of you on the sabbath loose his ox or ass
from the stall, and having led away, doth water \[it\]?

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> and this one, being a daughter of
Abraham, whom the Adversary bound, lo, eighteen years, did it not behove
to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath-day?'

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> And he saying these things, all who
were opposed to him were being ashamed, and all the multitude were
rejoicing over all the glorious things that are being done by him.

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> And he said, \`To what is the reign of
God like? and to what shall I liken it?

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> It is like to a grain of mustard, which
a man having taken, did cast into his garden, and it increased, and came
to a great tree, and the fowls of the heavens did rest in its branches.'

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> And again he said, \`To what shall I
liken the reign of God?

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> It is like leaven, which a woman,
having taken, did hide in three measures of meal, till that all was
leavened.'

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> And he was going through cities and
villages, teaching, and making progress toward Jerusalem;

<span id="an_13:23">13:23</span> and a certain one said to him, \`Sir,
are those saved few?' and he said unto them,

<span id="an_13:24">13:24</span> \`Be striving to go in through the
straight gate, because many, I say to you, will seek to go in, and shall
not be able;

<span id="an_13:25">13:25</span> from the time the master of the house
may have risen up, and may have shut the door, and ye may begin without
to stand, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, lord, open to us, and
he answering shall say to you, I have not known you whence ye are,

<span id="an_13:26">13:26</span> then ye may begin to say, We did eat
before thee, and did drink, and in our broad places thou didst teach;

<span id="an_13:27">13:27</span> and he shall say, I say to you, I have
not known you whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of the
unrighteousness.

<span id="an_13:28">13:28</span> \`There shall be there the weeping and
the gnashing of the teeth, when ye may see Abraham, and Isaac, and
Jacob, and all the prophets, in the reign of God, and yourselves being
cast out without;

<span id="an_13:29">13:29</span> and they shall come from east and west,
and from north and south, and shall recline in the reign of God,

<span id="an_13:30">13:30</span> and lo, there are last who shall be
first, and there are first who shall be last.'

<span id="an_13:31">13:31</span> On that day there came near certain
Pharisees, saying to him, \`Go forth, and be going on hence, for Herod
doth wish to kill thee;'

<span id="an_13:32">13:32</span> and he said to them, \`Having gone, say
to this fox, Lo, I cast forth demons, and perfect cures to-day and
to-morrow, and the third \[day\] I am being perfected;

<span id="an_13:33">13:33</span> but it behoveth me to-day, and
to-morrow, and the \[day\] following, to go on, because it is not
possible for a prophet to perish out of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_13:34">13:34</span> \`Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that is killing
the prophets, and stoning those sent unto her, how often did I will to
gather together thy children, as a hen her brood under the wings, and ye
did not will.

<span id="an_13:35">13:35</span> \`Lo, your house is being left to you
desolate, and verily I say to you -- ye may not see me, till it may
come, when ye may say, Blessed \[is\] he who is coming in the name of
the Lord.'

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> And it came to pass, on his going into
the house of a certain one of the chiefs of the Pharisees, on a sabbath,
to eat bread, that they were watching him,

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> and lo, there was a certain dropsical man
before him;

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> and Jesus answering spake to the lawyers
and Pharisees, saying, \`Is it lawful on the sabbath-day to heal?'

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> and they were silent, and having taken
hold of \[him\], he healed him, and let \[him\] go;

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> and answering them he said, \`Of which of
you shall an ass or ox fall into a pit, and he will not immediately draw
it up on the sabbath-day?'

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> and they were not able to answer him
again unto these things.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> And he spake a simile unto those called,
marking how they were choosing out the first couches, saying unto them,

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> \`When thou mayest be called by any one
to marriage-feasts, thou mayest not recline on the first couch, lest a
more honourable than thou may have been called by him,

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> and he who did call thee and him having
come shall say to thee, Give to this one place, and then thou mayest
begin with shame to occupy the last place.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> \`But, when thou mayest be called,
having gone on, recline in the last place, that when he who called thee
may come, he may say to thee, Friend, come up higher; then thou shalt
have glory before those reclining with thee;

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> because every one who is exalting
himself shall be humbled, and he who is humbling himself shall be
exalted.'

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> And he said also to him who did call
him, \`When thou mayest make a dinner or a supper, be not calling thy
friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kindred, nor rich neighbours, lest
they may also call thee again, and a recompense may come to thee;

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> but when thou mayest make a feast, be
calling poor, maimed, lame, blind,

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> and happy thou shalt be, because they
have not to recompense thee, for it shall be recompensed to thee in the
rising again of the righteous.'

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> And one of those reclining with him,
having heard these things, said to him, \`Happy \[is\] he who shall eat
bread in the reign of God;'

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> and he said to him, \`A certain man
made a great supper, and called many,

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> and he sent his servant at the hour of
the supper to say to those having been called, Be coming, because now
are all things ready.

<span id="an_14:18">14:18</span> \`And they began with one consent all
to excuse themselves: The first said to him, A field I bought, and I
have need to go forth and see it; I beg of thee, have me excused.

<span id="an_14:19">14:19</span> \`And another said, Five yoke of oxen I
bought, and I go on to prove them; I beg of thee, have me excused:

<span id="an_14:20">14:20</span> and another said, A wife I married, and
because of this I am not able to come.

<span id="an_14:21">14:21</span> \`And that servant having come, told to
his lord these things, then the master of the house, having been angry,
said to his servant, Go forth quickly to the broad places and lanes of
the city, and the poor, and maimed, and lame, and blind, bring in
hither.

<span id="an_14:22">14:22</span> \`And the servant said, Sir, it hath
been done as thou didst command, and still there is room.

<span id="an_14:23">14:23</span> \`And the lord said unto the servant,
Go forth to the ways and hedges, and constrain to come in, that my house
may be filled;

<span id="an_14:24">14:24</span> for I say to you, that none of those
men who have been called shall taste of my supper.'

<span id="an_14:25">14:25</span> And there were going on with him great
multitudes, and having turned, he said unto them,

<span id="an_14:26">14:26</span> \`If any one doth come unto me, and
doth not hate his own father, and mother, and wife, and children, and
brothers, and sisters, and yet even his own life, he is not able to be
my disciple;

<span id="an_14:27">14:27</span> and whoever doth not bear his cross,
and come after me, is not able to be my disciple.

<span id="an_14:28">14:28</span> \`For who of you, willing to build a
tower, doth not first, having sat down, count the expense, whether he
have the things for completing?

<span id="an_14:29">14:29</span> lest that he having laid a foundation,
and not being able to finish, all who are beholding may begin to mock
him,

<span id="an_14:30">14:30</span> saying -- This man began to build, and
was not able to finish.

<span id="an_14:31">14:31</span> \`Or what king going on to engage with
another king in war, doth not, having sat down, first consult if he be
able with ten thousand to meet him who with twenty thousand is coming
against him?

<span id="an_14:32">14:32</span> and if not so -- he being yet a long
way off -- having sent an embassy, he doth ask the things for peace.

<span id="an_14:33">14:33</span> \`So, then, every one of you who doth
not take leave of all that he himself hath, is not able to be my
disciple.

<span id="an_14:34">14:34</span> \`The salt \[is\] good, but if the salt
doth become tasteless, with what shall it be seasoned?

<span id="an_14:35">14:35</span> neither for land nor for manure is it
fit -- they cast it without. He who is having ears to hear -- let him
hear.'

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> And all the tax-gatherers and the sinners
were coming nigh to him, to hear him,

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> and the Pharisees and the scribes were
murmuring, saying -- This one doth receive sinners, and doth eat with
them.'

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> And he spake unto them this simile,
saying,

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> \`What man of you having a hundred sheep,
and having lost one out of them, doth not leave behind the ninety-nine
in the wilderness, and go on after the lost one, till he may find it?

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> and having found, he doth lay \[it\] on
his shoulders rejoicing,

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> and having come to the house, he doth
call together the friends and the neighbours, saying to them, Rejoice
with me, because I found my sheep -- the lost one.

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> \`I say to you, that so joy shall be in
the heaven over one sinner reforming, rather than over ninety-nine
righteous men, who have no need of reformation.

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> \`Or what woman having ten drachms, if
she may lose one drachm, doth not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and
seek carefully till that she may find?

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> and having found, she doth call together
the female friends and the neighbours, saying, Rejoice with me, for I
found the drachm that I lost.

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> \`So I say to you, joy doth come before
the messengers of God over one sinner reforming.'

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> And he said, \`A certain man had two
sons,

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> and the younger of them said to the
father, Father, give me the portion of the substance falling to \[me\],
and he divided to them the living.

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> \`And not many days after, having
gathered all together, the younger son went abroad to a far country, and
there he scattered his substance, living riotously;

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> and he having spent all, there came a
mighty famine on that country, and himself began to be in want;

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> and having gone on, he joined himself
to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him to the fields to
feed swine,

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> and he was desirous to fill his belly
from the husks that the swine were eating, and no one was giving to him.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> \`And having come to himself, he said,
How many hirelings of my father have a superabundance of bread, and I
here with hunger am perishing!

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> having risen, I will go on unto my
father, and will say to him, Father, I did sin -- to the heaven, and
before thee,

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> and no more am I worthy to be called
thy son; make me as one of thy hirelings.

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> \`And having risen, he went unto his
own father, and he being yet far distant, his father saw him, and was
moved with compassion, and having ran he fell upon his neck and kissed
him;

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> and the son said to him, Father, I did
sin -- to the heaven, and before thee, and no more am I worthy to be
called thy son.

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> \`And the father said unto his
servants, Bring forth the first robe, and clothe him, and give a ring
for his hand, and sandals for the feet;

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> and having brought the fatted calf,
kill \[it\], and having eaten, we may be merry,

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> because this my son was dead, and did
live again, and he was lost, and was found; and they began to be merry.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> \`And his elder son was in a field, and
as, coming, he drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing,

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> and having called near one of the young
men, he was inquiring what these things might be,

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> and he said to him -- Thy brother is
arrived, and thy father did kill the fatted calf, because in health he
did receive him back.

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> \`And he was angry, and would not go
in, therefore his father, having come forth, was entreating him;

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> and he answering said to the father,
Lo, so many years I do serve thee, and never thy command did I
transgress, and to me thou didst never give a kid, that with my friends
I might make merry;

<span id="an_15:30">15:30</span> but when thy son -- this one who did
devour thy living with harlots -- came, thou didst kill to him the
fatted calf.

<span id="an_15:31">15:31</span> \`And he said to him, Child, thou art
always with me, and all my things are thine;

<span id="an_15:32">15:32</span> but to be merry, and to be glad, it was
needful, because this thy brother was dead, and did live again, he was
lost, and was found.'

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> And he said also unto his disciples, \`A
certain man was rich, who had a steward, and he was accused to him as
scattering his goods;

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> and having called him, he said to him,
What \[is\] this I hear about thee? render the account of thy
stewardship, for thou mayest not any longer be steward.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> \`And the steward said in himself, What
shall I do, because my lord doth take away the stewardship from me? to
dig I am not able, to beg I am ashamed: --

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> I have known what I shall do, that, when
I may be removed from the stewardship, they may receive me to their
houses.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> \`And having called near each one of his
lord's debtors, he said to the first, How much dost thou owe to my lord?

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> and he said, A hundred baths of oil; and
he said to him, Take thy bill, and having sat down write fifty.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> \`Afterward to another he said, And thou,
how much dost thou owe? and he said, A hundred cors of wheat; and he
saith to him, Take thy bill, and write eighty.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> \`And the lord commended the unrighteous
steward that he did prudently, because the sons of this age are more
prudent than the sons of the light, in respect to their generation.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> and I say to you, Make to yourselves
friends out of the mammon of unrighteousness, that when ye may fail,
they may receive you to the age-during tabernacles.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> \`He who is faithful in the least,
\[is\] also faithful in much; and he who in the least \[is\]
unrighteous, is also unrighteous in much;

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> if, then, in the unrighteous mammon ye
became not faithful -- the true who will entrust to you?

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> and if in the other's ye became not
faithful -- your own, who shall give to you?

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> \`No domestic is able to serve two
lords, for either the one he will hate, and the other he will love; or
one he will hold to, and of the other he will be heedless; ye are not
able to serve God and mammon.'

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> And also the Pharisees, being lovers of
money, were hearing all these things, and were deriding him,

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> and he said to them, \`Ye are those
declaring yourselves righteous before men, but God doth know your
hearts; because that which among men is high, \[is\] abomination before
God;

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> the law and the prophets \[are\] till
John; since then the reign of God is proclaimed good news, and every one
doth press into it;

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> and it is easier to the heaven and the
earth to pass away, than of the law one tittle to fall.

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> \`Every one who is sending away his
wife, and marrying another, doth commit adultery; and every one who is
marrying her sent away from a husband doth commit adultery.

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> \`And -- a certain man was rich, and
was clothed in purple and fine linen, making merry sumptuously every
day,

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> and there was a certain poor man, by
name Lazarus, who was laid at his porch, full of sores,

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> and desiring to be filled from the
crumbs that are falling from the table of the rich man; yea, also the
dogs, coming, were licking his sores.

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> \`And it came to pass, that the poor
man died, and that he was carried away by the messengers to the bosom of
Abraham -- and the rich man also died, and was buried;

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> and in the hades having lifted up his
eyes, being in torments, he doth see Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in
his bosom,

<span id="an_16:24">16:24</span> and having cried, he said, Father
Abraham, deal kindly with me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip
of his finger in water, and may cool my tongue, because I am distressed
in this flame.

<span id="an_16:25">16:25</span> \`And Abraham said, Child, remember
that thou did receive -- thou -- thy good things in thy life, and
Lazarus in like manner the evil things, and now he is comforted, and
thou art distressed;

<span id="an_16:26">16:26</span> and besides all these things, between
us and you a great chasm is fixed, so that they who are willing to go
over from hence unto you are not able, nor do they from thence to us
pass through.

<span id="an_16:27">16:27</span> \`And he said, I pray thee, then,
father, that thou mayest send him to the house of my father,

<span id="an_16:28">16:28</span> for I have five brothers, so that he
may thoroughly testify to them, that they also may not come to this
place of torment.

<span id="an_16:29">16:29</span> \`Abraham saith to him, They have Moses
and the prophets, let them hear them;

<span id="an_16:30">16:30</span> and he said, No, father Abraham, but if
any one from the dead may go unto them, they will reform.

<span id="an_16:31">16:31</span> And he said to him, If Moses and the
prophets they do not hear, neither if one may rise out of the dead will
they be persuaded.'

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> And he said unto the disciples, \`It is
impossible for the stumbling blocks not to come, but wo \[to him\]
through whom they come;

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> it is more profitable to him if a weighty
millstone is put round about his neck, and he hath been cast into the
sea, than that he may cause one of these little ones to stumble.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> \`Take heed to yourselves, and, if thy
brother may sin in regard to thee, rebuke him, and if he may reform,
forgive him,

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> and if seven times in the day he may sin
against thee, and seven times in the day may turn back to thee, saying,
I reform; thou shalt forgive him.'

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> And the apostles said to the Lord, \`Add
to us faith;'

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> and the Lord said, \`If ye had faith as a
grain of mustard, ye would have said to this sycamine, Be uprooted, and
be planted in the sea, and it would have obeyed you.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> \`But, who is he of you -- having a
servant ploughing or feeding -- who, to him having come in out of the
field, will say, Having come near, recline at meat?

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> but will not \[rather\] say to him,
Prepare what I may sup, and having girded thyself about, minister to me,
till I eat and drink, and after these things thou shalt eat and drink?

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> Hath he favour to that servant because he
did the things directed? I think not.

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> \`So also ye, when ye may have done all
the things directed you, say -- We are unprofitable servants, because
that which we owed to do -- we have done.'

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> And it came to pass, in his going on to
Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee,

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> and he entering into a certain village,
there met him ten leprous men, who stood afar off,

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> and they lifted up the voice, saying,
\`Jesus, master, deal kindly with us;'

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> and having seen \[them\], he said to
them, \`Having gone on, shew yourselves to the priests;' and it came to
pass, in their going, they were cleansed,

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> and one of them having seen that he was
healed did turn back, with a loud voice glorifying God,

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> and he fell upon \[his\] face at his
feet, giving thanks to him, and he was a Samaritan.

<span id="an_17:17">17:17</span> And Jesus answering said, \`Were not
the ten cleansed, and the nine -- where?

<span id="an_17:18">17:18</span> There were not found who did turn back
to give glory to God, except this alien;'

<span id="an_17:19">17:19</span> and he said to him, \`Having risen, be
going on, thy faith hath saved thee.'

<span id="an_17:20">17:20</span> And having been questioned by the
Pharisees, when the reign of God doth come, he answered them, and said,
\`The reign of God doth not come with observation;

<span id="an_17:21">17:21</span> nor shall they say, Lo, here; or lo,
there; for lo, the reign of God is within you.'

<span id="an_17:22">17:22</span> And he said unto his disciples, \`Days
will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of
Man, and ye shall not behold \[it\];

<span id="an_17:23">17:23</span> and they shall say to you, Lo, here; or
lo, there; ye may not go away, nor follow;

<span id="an_17:24">17:24</span> for as the lightning that is lightening
out of the one \[part\] under heaven, to the other part under heaven
doth shine, so shall be also the Son of Man in his day;

<span id="an_17:25">17:25</span> and first it behoveth him to suffer
many things, and to be rejected by this generation.

<span id="an_17:26">17:26</span> \`And, as it came to pass in the days
of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man;

<span id="an_17:27">17:27</span> they were eating, they were drinking,
they were marrying, they were given in marriage, till the day that Noah
entered into the ark, and the deluge came, and destroyed all;

<span id="an_17:28">17:28</span> in like manner also, as it came to pass
in the days of Lot; they were eating, they were drinking, they were
buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building;

<span id="an_17:29">17:29</span> and on the day Lot went forth from
Sodom, He rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed all.

<span id="an_17:30">17:30</span> \`According to these things it shall
be, in the day the Son of Man is revealed;

<span id="an_17:31">17:31</span> in that day, he who shall be on the
house top, and his vessels in the house, let him not come down to take
them away; and he in the field, in like manner, let him not turn
backward;

<span id="an_17:32">17:32</span> remember the wife of Lot.

<span id="an_17:33">17:33</span> Whoever may seek to save his life,
shall lose it; and whoever may lose it, shall preserve it.

<span id="an_17:34">17:34</span> \`I say to you, In that night, there
shall be two men on one couch, the one shall be taken, and the other
shall be left;

<span id="an_17:35">17:35</span> two women shall be grinding at the same
place together, the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left;

<span id="an_17:36">17:36</span> two men shall be in the field, the one
shall be taken, and the other left.'

<span id="an_17:37">17:37</span> And they answering say to him, \`Where,
sir?' and he said to them, \`Where the body \[is\], there will the
eagles be gathered together.'

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> And he spake also a simile to them, that
it behoveth \[us\] always to pray, and not to faint,

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> saying, \`A certain judge was in a
certain city -- God he is not fearing, and man he is not regarding --

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> and a widow was in that city, and she was
coming unto him, saying, Do me justice on my opponent,

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> and he would not for a time, but after
these things he said in himself, Even if God I do not fear, and man do
not regard,

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> yet because this widow doth give me
trouble, I will do her justice, lest, perpetually coming, she may plague
me.'

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> And the Lord said, \`Hear ye what the
unrighteous judge saith:

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> and shall not God execute the justice to
His choice ones, who are crying unto Him day and night -- bearing long
in regard to them?

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> I say to you, that He will execute the
justice to them quickly; but the Son of Man having come, shall he find
the faith upon the earth?'

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> And he spake also unto certain who have
been trusting in themselves that they were righteous, and have been
despising the rest, this simile:

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> \`Two men went up to the temple to
pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax-gatherer;

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> the Pharisee having stood by himself,
thus prayed: God, I thank Thee that I am not as the rest of men,
rapacious, unrighteous, adulterers, or even as this tax-gatherer;

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> I fast twice in the week, I give tithes
of all things -- as many as I possess.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> \`And the tax-gatherer, having stood
afar off, would not even the eyes lift up to the heaven, but was smiting
on his breast, saying, God be propitious to me -- the sinner!

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> I say to you, this one went down
declared righteous, to his house, rather than that one: for every one
who is exalting himself shall be humbled, and he who is humbling himself
shall be exalted.'

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> And they were bringing near also the
babes, that he may touch them, and the disciples having seen did rebuke
them,

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> and Jesus having called them near,
said, \`Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not,
for of such is the reign of God;

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> verily I say to you, Whoever may not
receive the reign of God as a little child, may not enter into it.'

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> And a certain ruler questioned him,
saying, \`Good teacher, what having done -- shall I inherit life
age-during?'

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> And Jesus said to him, \`Why me dost
thou call good? no one \[is\] good, except One -- God;

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> the commands thou hast known: Thou
mayest not commit adultery, Thou mayest do no murder, Thou mayest not
steal, Thou mayest not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy
mother.'

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> And he said, \`All these I did keep
from my youth;'

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> and having heard these things, Jesus
said to him, \`Yet one thing to thee is lacking; all things -- as many
as thou hast -- sell, and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have
treasure in heaven, and come, be following me;'

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> and he, having heard these things,
became very sorrowful, for he was exceeding rich.

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> And Jesus having seen him become very
sorrowful, said, \`How hardly shall those having riches enter into the
reign of God!

<span id="an_18:25">18:25</span> for it is easier for a camel through
the eye of a needle to enter, than for a rich man into the reign of God
to enter.'

<span id="an_18:26">18:26</span> And those who heard, said, \`And who is
able to be saved?'

<span id="an_18:27">18:27</span> and he said, \`The things impossible
with men are possible with God.'

<span id="an_18:28">18:28</span> And Peter said, \`Lo, we left all, and
did follow thee;'

<span id="an_18:29">18:29</span> and he said to them, \`Verily I say to
you, that there is not one who left house, or parents, or brothers, or
wife, or children, for the sake of the reign of God,

<span id="an_18:30">18:30</span> who may not receive back manifold more
in this time, and in the coming age, life age-during.'

<span id="an_18:31">18:31</span> And having taken the twelve aside, he
said unto them, \`Lo, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall be
completed -- that have been written through the prophets -- to the Son
of Man,

<span id="an_18:32">18:32</span> for he shall be delivered up to the
nations, and shall be mocked, and insulted, and spit upon,

<span id="an_18:33">18:33</span> and having scourged they shall put him
to death, and on the third day he shall rise again.'

<span id="an_18:34">18:34</span> And they none of these things
understood, and this saying was hid from them, and they were not knowing
the things said.

<span id="an_18:35">18:35</span> And it came to pass, in his coming nigh
to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting beside the way begging,

<span id="an_18:36">18:36</span> and having heard a multitude going by,
he was inquiring what this may be,

<span id="an_18:37">18:37</span> and they brought him word that Jesus
the Nazarene doth pass by,

<span id="an_18:38">18:38</span> and he cried out, saying, \`Jesus, Son
of David, deal kindly with me;'

<span id="an_18:39">18:39</span> and those going before were rebuking
him, that he might be silent, but he was much more crying out, \`Son of
David, deal kindly with me.'

<span id="an_18:40">18:40</span> And Jesus having stood, commanded him
to be brought unto him, and he having come nigh, he questioned him,

<span id="an_18:41">18:41</span> saying, \`What wilt thou I shall do to
thee?' and he said, \`Sir, that I may receive sight.'

<span id="an_18:42">18:42</span> And Jesus said to him, \`Receive thy
sight; thy faith hath saved thee;'

<span id="an_18:43">18:43</span> and presently he did receive sight, and
was following him, glorifying God; and all the people, having seen, did
give praise to God.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> And having entered, he was passing
through Jericho,

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> and lo, a man, by name called Zaccheus,
and he was a chief tax-gatherer, and he was rich,

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> and he was seeking to see Jesus, who he
is, and was not able for the multitude, because in stature he was small,

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> and having run forward before, he went up
on a sycamore, that he may see him, because through that \[way\] he was
about to pass by.

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> And as Jesus came up to the place, having
looked up, he saw him, and said unto him, \`Zaccheus, having hastened,
come down, for to-day in thy house it behoveth me to remain;'

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> and he having hastened did come down, and
did receive him rejoicing;

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> and having seen \[it\], they were all
murmuring, saying -- \`With a sinful man he went in to lodge!'

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> And Zaccheus having stood, said unto the
Lord, \`Lo, the half of my goods, sir, I give to the poor, and if of any
one anything I did take by false accusation, I give back fourfold.'

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> And Jesus said unto him -- \`To-day
salvation did come to this house, inasmuch as he also is a son of
Abraham;

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> for the Son of Man came to seek and to
save the lost.'

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> And while they are hearing these
things, having added he spake a simile, because of his being nigh to
Jerusalem, and of their thinking that the reign of God is about
presently to be made manifest.

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> He said therefore, \`A certain man of
birth went on to a far country, to take to himself a kingdom, and to
return,

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> and having called ten servants of his
own, he gave to them ten pounds, and said unto them, Do business -- till
I come;

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> and his citizens were hating him, and
did send an embassy after him, saying, We do not wish this one to reign
over us.

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> \`And it came to pass, on his coming
back, having taken the kingdom, that he commanded these servants to be
called to him, to whom he gave the money, that he might know what any
one had done in business.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> \`And the first came near, saying, Sir,
thy pound did gain ten pounds;

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> and he said to him, Well done, good
servant, because in a very little thou didst become faithful, be having
authority over ten cities.

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> \`And the second came, saying, Sir, thy
pound made five pounds;

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> and he said also to this one, And thou,
become thou over five cities.

<span id="an_19:20">19:20</span> \`And another came, saying, Sir, lo,
thy pound, that I had lying away in a napkin;

<span id="an_19:21">19:21</span> for I was afraid of thee, because thou
art an austere man; thou takest up what thou didst not lay down, and
reapest what thou didst not sow.

<span id="an_19:22">19:22</span> \`And he saith to him, Out of thy mouth
I will judge thee, evil servant: thou knewest that I am an austere man,
taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow!

<span id="an_19:23">19:23</span> and wherefore didst thou not give my
money to the bank, and I, having come, with interest might have received
it?

<span id="an_19:24">19:24</span> \`And to those standing by he said,
Take from him the pound, and give to him having the ten pounds --

<span id="an_19:25">19:25</span> (and they said to him, Sir, he hath ten
pounds) --

<span id="an_19:26">19:26</span> for I say to you, that to every one
having shall be given, and from him not having, also what he hath shall
be taken from him,

<span id="an_19:27">19:27</span> but those my enemies, who did not wish
me to reign over them, bring hither and slay before me.'

<span id="an_19:28">19:28</span> And having said these things, he went
on before, going up to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_19:29">19:29</span> And it came to pass, as he came nigh to
Bethphage and Bethany, unto the mount called of the Olives, he sent two
of his disciples,

<span id="an_19:30">19:30</span> having said, Go away to the village
over-against, in which, entering into, ye shall find a colt bound, on
which no one of men did ever sit, having loosed it, bring \[it\];

<span id="an_19:31">19:31</span> and if any one doth question you,
Wherefore do ye loose \[it\]? thus ye shall say to him -- The Lord hath
need of it.'

<span id="an_19:32">19:32</span> And those sent, having gone away, found
according as he said to them,

<span id="an_19:33">19:33</span> and while they are loosing the colt,
its owners said unto them, \`Why loose ye the colt?'

<span id="an_19:34">19:34</span> and they said, \`The Lord hath need of
it;'

<span id="an_19:35">19:35</span> and they brought it unto Jesus, and
having cast their garments upon the colt, they did set Jesus upon it.

<span id="an_19:36">19:36</span> And as he is going, they were spreading
their garments in the way,

<span id="an_19:37">19:37</span> and as he is coming nigh now, at the
descent of the mount of the Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples
began rejoicing to praise God with a great voice for all the mighty
works they had seen,

<span id="an_19:38">19:38</span> saying, \`blessed \[is\] he who is
coming, a king in the name of the Lord; peace in heaven, and glory in
the highest.'

<span id="an_19:39">19:39</span> And certain of the Pharisees from the
multitude said unto him, \`Teacher, rebuke thy disciples;'

<span id="an_19:40">19:40</span> and he answering said to them, \`I say
to you, that, if these shall be silent, the stones will cry out!'

<span id="an_19:41">19:41</span> And when he came nigh, having seen the
city, he wept over it,

<span id="an_19:42">19:42</span> saying -- \`If thou didst know, even
thou, at least in this thy day, the things for thy peace; but now they
were hid from thine eyes.

<span id="an_19:43">19:43</span> \`Because days shall come upon thee,
and thine enemies shall cast around thee a rampart, and compass thee
round, and press thee on every side,

<span id="an_19:44">19:44</span> and lay thee low, and thy children
within thee, and they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone,
because thou didst not know the time of thy inspection.'

<span id="an_19:45">19:45</span> And having entered into the temple, he
began to cast forth those selling in it, and those buying,

<span id="an_19:46">19:46</span> saying to them, \`It hath been written,
My house is a house of prayer -- but ye made it a den of robbers.'

<span id="an_19:47">19:47</span> And he was teaching daily in the
temple, but the chief priests and the scribes were seeking to destroy
him -- also the chiefs of the people --

<span id="an_19:48">19:48</span> and they were not finding what they
shall do, for all the people were hanging on him, hearing him.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> And it came to pass, on one of those
days, as he is teaching the people in the temple, and proclaiming good
news, the chief priests and the scribes, with the elders, came upon
\[him\],

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> and spake unto him, saying, \`Tell us by
what authority thou dost these things? or who is he that gave to thee
this authority?'

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> And he answering said unto them, \`I will
question you -- I also -- one thing, and tell me:

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> the baptism of John, from heaven was it,
or from men?'

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> And they reasoned with themselves, saying
-- \`If we may say, From heaven, he will say, Wherefore, then, did ye
not believe him?

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> and if we may say, From men, all the
people will stone us, for they are having been persuaded John to be a
prophet.'

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> And they answered, that they knew not
whence \[it was\],

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> and Jesus said to them, \`Neither do I
say to you by what authority I do these things.'

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> And he began to speak unto the people
this simile: \`A certain man planted a vineyard, and gave it out to
husbandmen, and went abroad for a long time,

<span id="an_20:10">20:10</span> and at the season he sent unto the
husbandmen a servant, that from the fruit of the vineyard they may give
to him, but the husbandmen having beat him, did send \[him\] away empty.

<span id="an_20:11">20:11</span> \`And he added to send another servant,
and they that one also having beaten and dishonoured, did send away
empty;

<span id="an_20:12">20:12</span> and he added to send a third, and this
one also, having wounded, they did cast out.

<span id="an_20:13">20:13</span> \`And the owner of the vineyard said,
What shall I do? I will send my son -- the beloved, perhaps having seen
this one, they will do reverence;

<span id="an_20:14">20:14</span> and having seen him, the husbandmen
reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir; come, we may kill
him, that the inheritance may become ours;

<span id="an_20:15">20:15</span> and having cast him outside of the
vineyard, they killed \[him\]; what, then, shall the owner of the
vineyard do to them?

<span id="an_20:16">20:16</span> He will come, and destroy these
husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others.' And having heard,
they said, \`Let it not be!'

<span id="an_20:17">20:17</span> and he, having looked upon them, said,
\`What, then, is this that hath been written: A stone that the builders
rejected -- this became head of a corner?

<span id="an_20:18">20:18</span> every one who hath fallen on that stone
shall be broken, and on whom it may fall, it will crush him to pieces.'

<span id="an_20:19">20:19</span> And the chief priests and the scribes
sought to lay hands on him in that hour, and they feared the people, for
they knew that against them he spake this simile.

<span id="an_20:20">20:20</span> And, having watched \[him\], they sent
forth liers in wait, feigning themselves to be righteous, that they
might take hold of his word, to deliver him up to the rule and to the
authority of the governor,

<span id="an_20:21">20:21</span> and they questioned him, saying,
\`Teacher, we have known that thou dost say and teach rightly, and dost
not accept a person, but in truth the way of God dost teach;

<span id="an_20:22">20:22</span> Is it lawful to us to give tribute to
Caesar or not?'

<span id="an_20:23">20:23</span> And he, having perceived their
craftiness, said unto them, \`Why me do ye tempt?

<span id="an_20:24">20:24</span> shew me a denary; of whom hath it an
image and superscription?' and they answering said, \`Of Caesar:'

<span id="an_20:25">20:25</span> and he said to them, \`Give back,
therefore, the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to
God;'

<span id="an_20:26">20:26</span> and they were not able to take hold on
his saying before the people, and having wondered at his answer, they
were silent.

<span id="an_20:27">20:27</span> And certain of the Sadducees, who are
denying that there is a rising again, having come near, questioned him,

<span id="an_20:28">20:28</span> saying, \`Teacher, Moses wrote to us,
If any one's brother may die, having a wife, and he may die childless --
that his brother may take the wife, and may raise up seed to his
brother.

<span id="an_20:29">20:29</span> \`There were, then, seven brothers, and
the first having taken a wife, died childless,

<span id="an_20:30">20:30</span> and the second took the wife, and he
died childless,

<span id="an_20:31">20:31</span> and the third took her, and in like
manner also the seven -- they left not children, and they died;

<span id="an_20:32">20:32</span> and last of all died also the woman:

<span id="an_20:33">20:33</span> in the rising again, then, of which of
them doth she become wife? -- for the seven had her as wife.'

<span id="an_20:34">20:34</span> And Jesus answering said to them, \`The
sons of this age do marry and are given in marriage,

<span id="an_20:35">20:35</span> but those accounted worthy to obtain
that age, and the rising again that is out of the dead, neither marry,
nor are they given in marriage;

<span id="an_20:36">20:36</span> for neither are they able to die any
more -- for they are like messengers -- and they are sons of God, being
sons of the rising again.

<span id="an_20:37">20:37</span> \`And that the dead are raised, even
Moses shewed at the Bush, since he doth call the Lord, the God of
Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;

<span id="an_20:38">20:38</span> and He is not a God of dead men, but of
living, for all live to Him.'

<span id="an_20:39">20:39</span> And certain of the scribes answering
said, \`Teacher, thou didst say well;'

<span id="an_20:40">20:40</span> and no more durst they question him
anything.

<span id="an_20:41">20:41</span> And he said unto them, \`How do they
say the Christ to be son of David,

<span id="an_20:42">20:42</span> and David himself saith in the Book of
Psalms, The Lord said to my lord, Sit thou on my right hand,

<span id="an_20:43">20:43</span> till I shall make thine enemies thy
footstool;

<span id="an_20:44">20:44</span> David, then, doth call him lord, and
how is he his son?'

<span id="an_20:45">20:45</span> And, all the people hearing, he said to
his disciples,

<span id="an_20:46">20:46</span> \`Take heed of the scribes, who are
wishing to walk in long robes, and are loving salutations in the
markets, and first seats in the synagogues, and first couches in the
suppers,

<span id="an_20:47">20:47</span> who devour the houses of the widows,
and for a pretence make long prayers, these shall receive more abundant
judgment.'

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> And having looked up, he saw those who
did cast their gifts to the treasury -- rich men,

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> and he saw also a certain poor widow
casting there two mites,

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> and he said, \`Truly I say to you, that
this poor widow did cast in more than all;

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> for all these out of their superabundance
did cast into the gifts to God, but this one out of her want, all the
living that she had, did cast in.'

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> And certain saying about the temple, that
with goodly stones and devoted things it hath been adorned, he said,

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> \`These things that ye behold -- days
will come, in which there shall not be left a stone upon a stone, that
shall not be thrown down.'

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> And they questioned him, saying,
\`Teacher, when, then, shall these things be? and what \[is\] the sign
when these things may be about to happen?'

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> And he said, \`See -- ye may not be led
astray, for many shall come in my name, saying -- I am \[he\], and the
time hath come nigh; go not on then after them;

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> and when ye may hear of wars and
uprisings, be not terrified, for it behoveth these things to happen
first, but the end \[is\] not immediately.'

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> Then said he to them, \`Nation shall
rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom,

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> great shakings also in every place, and
famines, and pestilences, there shall be; fearful things also, and great
signs from heaven there shall be;

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> and before all these, they shall lay on
you their hands, and persecute, delivering up to synagogues and prisons,
being brought before kings and governors for my name's sake;

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> and it shall become to you for a
testimony.

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> \`Settle, then, to your hearts, not to
meditate beforehand to reply,

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> for I will give to you a mouth and
wisdom that all your opposers shall not be able to refute or resist.

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> \`And ye shall be delivered up also by
parents, and brothers, and kindred, and friends, and they shall put of
you to death;

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> and ye shall be hated by all because of
my name --

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> and a hair out of your head shall not
perish;

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> in your patience possess ye your souls.

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> \`And when ye may see Jerusalem
surrounded by encampments, then know that come nigh did her desolation;

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> then those in Judea, let them flee to
the mountains; and those in her midst, let them depart out; and those in
the countries, let them not come in to her;

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> because these are days of vengeance, to
fulfil all things that have been written.

<span id="an_21:23">21:23</span> \`And wo to those with child, and to
those giving suck, in those days; for there shall be great distress on
the land, and wrath on this people;

<span id="an_21:24">21:24</span> and they shall fall by the mouth of the
sword, and shall be led captive to all the nations, and Jerusalem shall
be trodden down by nations, till the times of nations be fulfilled.

<span id="an_21:25">21:25</span> \`And there shall be signs in sun, and
moon, and stars, and on the land \[is\] distress of nations with
perplexity, sea and billow roaring;

<span id="an_21:26">21:26</span> men fainting at heart from fear, and
expectation of the things coming on the world, for the powers of the
heavens shall be shaken.

<span id="an_21:27">21:27</span> \`And then they shall see the Son of
Man, coming in a cloud, with power and much glory;

<span id="an_21:28">21:28</span> and these things beginning to happen
bend yourselves back, and lift up your heads, because your redemption
doth draw nigh.'

<span id="an_21:29">21:29</span> And he spake a simile to them: \`See
the fig-tree, and all the trees,

<span id="an_21:30">21:30</span> when they may now cast forth, having
seen, of yourselves ye know that now is the summer nigh;

<span id="an_21:31">21:31</span> so also ye, when ye may see these
things happening, ye know that near is the reign of God;

<span id="an_21:32">21:32</span> verily I say to you -- This generation
may not pass away till all may have come to pass;

<span id="an_21:33">21:33</span> the heaven and the earth shall pass
away, but my words may not pass away.

<span id="an_21:34">21:34</span> \`And take heed to yourselves, lest
your hearts may be weighed down with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and
anxieties of life, and suddenly that day may come on you,

<span id="an_21:35">21:35</span> for as a snare it shall come on all
those dwelling on the face of all the land,

<span id="an_21:36">21:36</span> watch ye, then, in every season,
praying that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that
are about to come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.'

<span id="an_21:37">21:37</span> And he was during the days in the
temple teaching, and during the nights, going forth, he was lodging at
the mount called of Olives;

<span id="an_21:38">21:38</span> and all the people were coming early
unto him in the temple to hear him.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> And the feast of the unleavened food was
coming nigh, that is called Passover,

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> and the chief priests and the scribes
were seeking how they may take him up, for they were afraid of the
people.

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> And the Adversary entered into Judas, who
is surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve,

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> and he, having gone away, spake with the
chief priests and the magistrates, how he might deliver him up to them,

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> and they rejoiced, and covenanted to give
him money,

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> and he agreed, and was seeking a
favourable season to deliver him up to them without tumult.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> And the day of the unleavened food came,
in which it was behoving the passover to be sacrificed,

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> and he sent Peter and John, saying,
\`Having gone on, prepare to us the passover, that we may eat;'

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> and they said to him, \`Where wilt thou
that we might prepare?'

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> And he said to them, \`Lo, in your
entering into the city, there shall meet you a man, bearing a pitcher of
water, follow him to the house where he doth go in,

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> and ye shall say to the master of the
house, The Teacher saith to thee, Where is the guest-chamber where the
passover with my disciples I may eat?

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> and he shall show you a large upper
room furnished, there make ready;'

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> and they, having gone away, found as he
hath said to them, and they made ready the passover.

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> And when the hour come, he reclined (at
meat), and the twelve apostles with him,

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> and he said unto them, \`With desire I
did desire to eat this passover with you before my suffering,

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> for I say to you, that no more may I
eat of it till it may be fulfilled in the reign of God.'

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> And having taken a cup, having given
thanks, he said, \`Take this and divide to yourselves,

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> for I say to you that I may not drink
of the produce of the vine till the reign of God may come.'

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> And having taken bread, having given
thanks, he brake and gave to them, saying, \`This is my body, that for
you is being given, this do ye -- to remembrance of me.'

<span id="an_22:20">22:20</span> In like manner, also, the cup after the
supping, saying, \`This cup \[is\] the new covenant in my blood, that
for you is being poured forth.

<span id="an_22:21">22:21</span> \`But, lo, the hand of him delivering
me up \[is\] with me on the table,

<span id="an_22:22">22:22</span> and indeed the Son of Man doth go
according to what hath been determined; but wo to that man through whom
he is being delivered up.'

<span id="an_22:23">22:23</span> And they began to reason among
themselves, who then of them it may be, who is about to do this thing.

<span id="an_22:24">22:24</span> And there happened also a strife among
them -- who of them is accounted to be greater.

<span id="an_22:25">22:25</span> And he said to them, \`The kings of the
nations do exercise lordship over them, and those exercising authority
upon them are called benefactors;

<span id="an_22:26">22:26</span> but ye \[are\] not so, but he who is
greater among you -- let him be as the younger; and he who is leading,
as he who is ministering;

<span id="an_22:27">22:27</span> for who is greater? he who is reclining
(at meat), or he who is ministering? is it not he who is reclining (at
meat)? and I -- I am in your midst as he who is ministering.

<span id="an_22:28">22:28</span> \`And ye -- ye are those who have
remained with me in my temptations,

<span id="an_22:29">22:29</span> and I appoint to you, as my Father did
appoint to me, a kingdom,

<span id="an_22:30">22:30</span> that ye may eat and may drink at my
table, in my kingdom, and may sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes
of Israel.'

<span id="an_22:31">22:31</span> And the Lord said, \`Simon, Simon, lo,
the Adversary did ask you for himself to sift as the wheat,

<span id="an_22:32">22:32</span> and I besought for thee, that thy faith
may not fail; and thou, when thou didst turn, strengthen thy brethren.'

<span id="an_22:33">22:33</span> And he said to him, \`Sir, with thee I
am ready both to prison and to death to go;'

<span id="an_22:34">22:34</span> and he said, \`I say to thee, Peter, a
cock shall not crow to-day, before thrice thou mayest disown knowing
me.'

<span id="an_22:35">22:35</span> And he said to them, \`When I sent you
without bag, and scrip, and sandals, did ye lack anything?' and they
said, \`Nothing.'

<span id="an_22:36">22:36</span> Then said he to them, \`But, now, he
who is having a bag, let him take \[it\] up, and in like manner also a
scrip; and he who is not having, let him sell his garment, and buy a
sword,

<span id="an_22:37">22:37</span> for I say to you, that yet this that
hath been written it behoveth to be fulfilled in me: And with lawless
ones he was reckoned, for also the things concerning me have an end.'

<span id="an_22:38">22:38</span> And they said, \`Sir, lo, here \[are\]
two swords;' and he said to them, \`It is sufficient.'

<span id="an_22:39">22:39</span> And having gone forth, he went on,
according to custom, to the mount of the Olives, and his disciples also
followed him,

<span id="an_22:40">22:40</span> and having come to the place, he said
to them, \`Pray ye not to enter into temptation.'

<span id="an_22:41">22:41</span> And he was withdrawn from them, as it
were a stone's cast, and having fallen on the knees he was praying,

<span id="an_22:42">22:42</span> saying, \`Father, if Thou be
counselling to make this cup pass from me --; but, not my will, but
Thine be done.' --

<span id="an_22:43">22:43</span> And there appeared to him a messenger
from heaven strengthening him;

<span id="an_22:44">22:44</span> and having been in agony, he was more
earnestly praying, and his sweat became, as it were, great drops of
blood falling upon the ground.

<span id="an_22:45">22:45</span> And having risen up from the prayer,
having come unto the disciples, he found them sleeping from the sorrow,

<span id="an_22:46">22:46</span> and he said to them, \`Why do ye sleep?
having risen, pray that ye may not enter into temptation.'

<span id="an_22:47">22:47</span> And while he is speaking, lo, a
multitude, and he who is called Judas, one of the twelve, was coming
before them, and he came nigh to Jesus to kiss him,

<span id="an_22:48">22:48</span> and Jesus said to him, \`Judas, with a
kiss the Son of Man dost thou deliver up?'

<span id="an_22:49">22:49</span> And those about him, having seen what
was about to be, said to him, \`Sir, shall we smite with a sword?'

<span id="an_22:50">22:50</span> And a certain one of them smote the
servant of the chief priest, and took off his right ear,

<span id="an_22:51">22:51</span> and Jesus answering said, \`Suffer ye
thus far,' and having touched his ear, he healed him.

<span id="an_22:52">22:52</span> And Jesus said to those having come
upon him -- chief priests, and magistrates of the temple, and elders --
\`As upon a robber have ye come forth, with swords and sticks?

<span id="an_22:53">22:53</span> while daily I was with you in the
temple, ye did stretch forth no hands against me; but this is your hour
and the power of the darkness.'

<span id="an_22:54">22:54</span> And having taken him, they led and
brought him to the house of the chief priest. And Peter was following
afar off,

<span id="an_22:55">22:55</span> and they having kindled a fire in the
midst of the court, and having sat down together, Peter was sitting in
the midst of them,

<span id="an_22:56">22:56</span> and a certain maid having seen him
sitting at the light, and having earnestly looked at him, she said,
\`And this one was with him!'

<span id="an_22:57">22:57</span> and he disowned him, saying, \`Woman, I
have not known him.'

<span id="an_22:58">22:58</span> And after a little, another having seen
him, said, \`And thou art of them!' and Peter said, \`Man, I am not.'

<span id="an_22:59">22:59</span> And one hour, as it were, having
intervened, a certain other was confidently affirming, saying, \`Of a
truth this one also was with him, for he is also a Galilean;'

<span id="an_22:60">22:60</span> and Peter said, \`Man, I have not known
what thou sayest;' and presently, while he is speaking, a cock crew.

<span id="an_22:61">22:61</span> And the Lord having turned did look on
Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him --
\`Before a cock shall crow, thou mayest disown me thrice;'

<span id="an_22:62">22:62</span> and Peter having gone without, wept
bitterly.

<span id="an_22:63">22:63</span> And the men who were holding Jesus were
mocking him, beating \[him\];

<span id="an_22:64">22:64</span> and having blindfolded him, they were
striking him on the face, and were questioning him, saying, \`Prophesy
who he is who smote thee?'

<span id="an_22:65">22:65</span> and many other things, speaking evilly,
they spake in regard to him.

<span id="an_22:66">22:66</span> And when it became day there was
gathered together the eldership of the people, chief priests also, and
scribes, and they led him up to their own sanhedrim,

<span id="an_22:67">22:67</span> saying, \`If thou be the Christ, tell
us.' And he said to them, \`If I may tell you, ye will not believe;

<span id="an_22:68">22:68</span> and if I also question \[you\], ye will
not answer me or send me away;

<span id="an_22:69">22:69</span> henceforth, there shall be the Son of
Man sitting on the right hand of the power of God.'

<span id="an_22:70">22:70</span> And they all said, \`Thou, then, art
the Son of God?' and he said unto them, \`Ye say \[it\], because I am;'

<span id="an_22:71">22:71</span> and they said, \`What need yet have we
of testimony? for we ourselves did hear \[it\] from his mouth.'

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> And having risen, the whole multitude of
them did lead him to Pilate,

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> and began to accuse him, saying, \`This
one we found perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to
Caesar, saying himself to be Christ a king.'

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> And Pilate questioned him, saying, \`Thou
art the king of the Jews?' and he answering him, said, \`Thou dost say
\[it\].'

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> And Pilate said unto the chief priests,
and the multitude, \`I find no fault in this man;'

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> and they were the more urgent, saying --
\`He doth stir up the people, teaching throughout the whole of Judea --
having begun from Galilee -- unto this place.'

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> And Pilate having heard of Galilee,
questioned if the man is a Galilean,

<span id="an_23:7">23:7</span> and having known that he is from the
jurisdiction of Herod, he sent him back unto Herod, he being also in
Jerusalem in those days.

<span id="an_23:8">23:8</span> And Herod having seen Jesus did rejoice
exceedingly, for he was wishing for a long \[time\] to see him, because
of hearing many things about him, and he was hoping some sign to see
done by him,

<span id="an_23:9">23:9</span> and was questioning him in many words,
and he answered him nothing.

<span id="an_23:10">23:10</span> And the chief priests and the scribes
stood vehemently accusing him,

<span id="an_23:11">23:11</span> and Herod with his soldiers having set
him at nought, and having mocked, having put around him gorgeous
apparel, did send him back to Pilate,

<span id="an_23:12">23:12</span> and both Pilate and Herod became
friends on that day with one another, for they were before at enmity
between themselves.

<span id="an_23:13">23:13</span> And Pilate having called together the
chief priests, and the rulers, and the people,

<span id="an_23:14">23:14</span> said unto them, \`Ye brought to me this
man as perverting the people, and lo, I before you having examined,
found in this man no fault in those things ye bring forward against him;

<span id="an_23:15">23:15</span> no, nor yet Herod, for I sent you back
unto him, and lo, nothing worthy of death is having been done by him;

<span id="an_23:16">23:16</span> having chastised, therefore, I will
release him,'

<span id="an_23:17">23:17</span> for it was necessary for him to release
to them one at every feast,

<span id="an_23:18">23:18</span> and they cried out -- the whole
multitude -- saying, \`Away with this one, and release to us Barabbas,'

<span id="an_23:19">23:19</span> who had been, because of a certain
sedition made in the city, and murder, cast into prison.

<span id="an_23:20">23:20</span> Pilate again then -- wishing to release
Jesus -- called to them,

<span id="an_23:21">23:21</span> but they were calling out, saying,
\`Crucify, crucify him.'

<span id="an_23:22">23:22</span> And he a third time said unto them,
\`Why, what evil did he? no cause of death did I find in him; having
chastised him, then, I will release \[him\].'

<span id="an_23:23">23:23</span> And they were pressing with loud voices
asking him to be crucified, and their voices, and those of the chief
priests, were prevailing,

<span id="an_23:24">23:24</span> and Pilate gave judgment for their
request being done,

<span id="an_23:25">23:25</span> and he released him who because of
sedition and murder hath been cast into the prison, whom they were
asking, and Jesus he gave up to their will.

<span id="an_23:26">23:26</span> And as they led him away, having taken
hold on Simon, a certain Cyrenian, coming from the field, they put on
him the cross, to bear \[it\] behind Jesus.

<span id="an_23:27">23:27</span> And there was following him a great
multitude of the people, and of women, who also were beating themselves
and lamenting him,

<span id="an_23:28">23:28</span> and Jesus having turned unto them,
said, \`Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but for yourselves weep
ye, and for your children;

<span id="an_23:29">23:29</span> for, lo, days do come, in which they
shall say, Happy the barren, and wombs that did not bare, and paps that
did not give suck;

<span id="an_23:30">23:30</span> then they shall begin to say to the
mountains, Fall on us, and to the hills, Cover us; --

<span id="an_23:31">23:31</span> for, if in the green tree they do these
things -- in the dry what may happen?'

<span id="an_23:32">23:32</span> And there were also others -- two
evil-doers -- with him, to be put to death;

<span id="an_23:33">23:33</span> and when they came to the place that is
called Skull, there they crucified him and the evil-doers, one on the
right hand and one on the left.

<span id="an_23:34">23:34</span> And Jesus said, \`Father, forgive them,
for they have not known what they do;' and parting his garments they
cast a lot.

<span id="an_23:35">23:35</span> And the people were standing, looking
on, and the rulers also were sneering with them, saying, \`Others he
saved, let him save himself, if this be the Christ, the choice one of
God.'

<span id="an_23:36">23:36</span> And mocking him also were the soldiers,
coming near and offering vinegar to him,

<span id="an_23:37">23:37</span> and saying, \`If thou be the king of
the Jews, save thyself.'

<span id="an_23:38">23:38</span> And there was also a superscription
written over him, in letters of Greek, and Roman, and Hebrew, \`This is
the King of the Jews.'

<span id="an_23:39">23:39</span> And one of the evil-doers who were
hanged, was speaking evil of him, saying, \`If thou be the Christ, save
thyself and us.'

<span id="an_23:40">23:40</span> And the other answering, was rebuking
him, saying, \`Dost thou not even fear God, that thou art in the same
judgment?

<span id="an_23:41">23:41</span> and we indeed righteously, for things
worthy of what we did we receive back, but this one did nothing out of
place;'

<span id="an_23:42">23:42</span> and he said to Jesus, \`Remember me,
lord, when thou mayest come in thy reign;'

<span id="an_23:43">23:43</span> and Jesus said to him, \`Verily I say
to thee, To-day with me thou shalt be in the paradise.'

<span id="an_23:44">23:44</span> And it was, as it were, the sixth hour,
and darkness came over all the land till the ninth hour,

<span id="an_23:45">23:45</span> and the sun was darkened, and the vail
of the sanctuary was rent in the midst,

<span id="an_23:46">23:46</span> and having cried with a loud voice,
Jesus said, \`Father, to Thy hands I commit my spirit;' and these things
having said, he breathed forth the spirit.

<span id="an_23:47">23:47</span> And the centurion having seen what was
done, did glorify God, saying, \`Really this man was righteous;'

<span id="an_23:48">23:48</span> and all the multitudes who were come
together to this sight, beholding the things that came to pass, smiting
their breasts did turn back;

<span id="an_23:49">23:49</span> and all his acquaintances stood afar
off, and women who did follow him from Galilee, beholding these things.

<span id="an_23:50">23:50</span> And lo, a man, by name Joseph, being a
counsellor, a man good and righteous,

<span id="an_23:51">23:51</span> -- he was not consenting to their
counsel and deed -- from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who also himself
was expecting the reign of God,

<span id="an_23:52">23:52</span> he, having gone near to Pilate, asked
the body of Jesus,

<span id="an_23:53">23:53</span> and having taken it down, he wrapped it
in fine linen, and placed it in a tomb hewn out, where no one was yet
laid.

<span id="an_23:54">23:54</span> And the day was a preparation, and
sabbath was approaching,

<span id="an_23:55">23:55</span> and the women also who have come with
him out of Galilee having followed after, beheld the tomb, and how his
body was placed,

<span id="an_23:56">23:56</span> and having turned back, they made ready
spices and ointments, and on the sabbath, indeed, they rested, according
to the command.

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> And on the first of the sabbaths, at
early dawn, they came to the tomb, bearing the spices they made ready,
and certain \[others\] with them,

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> and they found the stone having been
rolled away from the tomb,

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> and having gone in, they found not the
body of the Lord Jesus.

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> And it came to pass, while they are
perplexed about this, that lo, two men stood by them in glittering
apparel,

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> and on their having become afraid, and
having inclined the face to the earth, they said to them, \`Why do ye
seek the living with the dead?

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> he is not here, but was raised; remember
how he spake to you, being yet in Galilee,

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> saying -- It behoveth the Son of Man to
be delivered up to the hands of sinful men, and to be crucified, and the
third day to rise again.'

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> And they remembered his sayings,

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> and having turned back from the tomb told
all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> And it was the Magdalene Mary, and
Joanna, and Mary of James, and the other women with them, who told unto
the apostles these things,

<span id="an_24:11">24:11</span> and their sayings appeared before them
as idle talk, and they were not believing them.

<span id="an_24:12">24:12</span> And Peter having risen, did run to the
tomb, and having stooped down he seeth the linen clothes lying alone,
and he went away to his own home, wondering at that which was come to
pass.

<span id="an_24:13">24:13</span> And, lo, two of them were going on
during that day to a village, distant sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, the
name of which \[is\] Emmaus,

<span id="an_24:14">24:14</span> and they were conversing with one
another about all these things that have happened.

<span id="an_24:15">24:15</span> And it came to pass in their conversing
and reasoning together, that Jesus himself, having come nigh, was going
on with them,

<span id="an_24:16">24:16</span> and their eyes were holden so as not to
know him,

<span id="an_24:17">24:17</span> and he said unto them, \`What \[are\]
these words that ye exchange with one another, walking, and ye are sad?'

<span id="an_24:18">24:18</span> And the one, whose name was Cleopas,
answering, said unto him, \`Art thou alone such a stranger in Jerusalem,
that thou hast not known the things that came to pass in it in these
days?'

<span id="an_24:19">24:19</span> And he said to them, \`What things?'
And they said to him, \`The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who became a
man -- a prophet -- powerful in deed and word, before God and all the
people,

<span id="an_24:20">24:20</span> how also the chief priests and our
rulers did deliver him up to a judgment of death, and crucified him;

<span id="an_24:21">24:21</span> and we were hoping that he it is who is
about to redeem Israel, and also with all these things, this third day
is passing to-day, since these things happened.

<span id="an_24:22">24:22</span> \`And certain women of ours also
astonished us, coming early to the tomb,

<span id="an_24:23">24:23</span> and not having found his body, they
came, saying also to have seen an apparition of messengers, who say he
is alive,

<span id="an_24:24">24:24</span> and certain of those with us went away
unto the tomb, and found as even the women said, and him they saw not.'

<span id="an_24:25">24:25</span> And he said unto them, \`O
inconsiderate and slow in heart, to believe on all that the prophets
spake!

<span id="an_24:26">24:26</span> Was it not behoving the Christ these
things to suffer, and to enter into his glory?'

<span id="an_24:27">24:27</span> and having begun from Moses, and from
all the prophets, he was expounding to them in all the Writings the
things about himself.

<span id="an_24:28">24:28</span> And they came nigh to the village
whither they were going, and he made an appearance of going on further,

<span id="an_24:29">24:29</span> and they constrained him, saying,
\`Remain with us, for it is toward evening,' and the day did decline,
and he went in to remain with them.

<span id="an_24:30">24:30</span> And it came to pass, in his reclining
(at meat) with them, having taken the bread, he blessed, and having
broken, he was giving to them,

<span id="an_24:31">24:31</span> and their eyes were opened, and they
recognized him, and he became unseen by them.

<span id="an_24:32">24:32</span> And they said one to another, \`Was not
our heart burning within us, as he was speaking to us in the way, and as
he was opening up to us the Writings?'

<span id="an_24:33">24:33</span> And they, having risen up the same
hour, turned back to Jerusalem, and found gathered together the eleven,
and those with them,

<span id="an_24:34">24:34</span> saying -- \`The Lord was raised indeed,
and was seen by Simon;'

<span id="an_24:35">24:35</span> and they were telling the things in the
way, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of the bread,

<span id="an_24:36">24:36</span> and as they are speaking these things,
Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith to them, \`Peace --
to you;'

<span id="an_24:37">24:37</span> and being amazed, and becoming
affrighted, they were thinking themselves to see a spirit.

<span id="an_24:38">24:38</span> And he said to them, \`Why are ye
troubled? and wherefore do reasonings come up in your hearts?

<span id="an_24:39">24:39</span> see my hands and my feet, that I am he;
handle me and see, because a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see
me having.'

<span id="an_24:40">24:40</span> And having said this, he shewed to them
the hands and the feet,

<span id="an_24:41">24:41</span> and while they are not believing from
the joy, and wondering, he said to them, \`Have ye anything here to
eat?'

<span id="an_24:42">24:42</span> and they gave to him part of a broiled
fish, and of an honeycomb,

<span id="an_24:43">24:43</span> and having taken, he did eat before
them,

<span id="an_24:44">24:44</span> and he said to them, \`These \[are\]
the words that I spake unto you, being yet with you, that it behoveth to
be fulfilled all the things that are written in the Law of Moses, and
the Prophets, and the Psalms, about me.'

<span id="an_24:45">24:45</span> Then opened he up their understanding
to understand the Writings,

<span id="an_24:46">24:46</span> and he said to them -- \`Thus it hath
been written, and thus it was behoving the Christ to suffer, and to rise
out of the dead the third day,

<span id="an_24:47">24:47</span> and reformation and remission of sins
to be proclaimed in his name to all the nations, beginning from
Jerusalem:

<span id="an_24:48">24:48</span> and ye -- ye are witnesses of these
things.

<span id="an_24:49">24:49</span> \`And, lo, I do send the promise of my
Father upon you, but ye -- abide ye in the city of Jerusalem till ye be
clothed with power from on high.'

<span id="an_24:50">24:50</span> And he led them forth without -- unto
Bethany, and having lifted up his hands he did bless them,

<span id="an_24:51">24:51</span> and it came to pass, in his blessing
them, he was parted from them, and was borne up to the heaven;

<span id="an_24:52">24:52</span> and they, having bowed before him, did
turn back to Jerusalem with great joy,

<span id="an_24:53">24:53</span> and were continually in the temple,
praising and blessing God. Amen.
