### Young's Literal Translation: Nehemiah

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Words of Nehemiah son of Hachaliah. And it
cometh to pass, in the month of Chisleu, the twentieth year, and I have
been in Shushan the palace,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> and come in doth Hanani, one of my
brethren, he and men of Judah, and I ask them concerning the Jews, the
escaped part that have been left of the captivity, and concerning
Jerusalem;

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> and they say to me, \`Those left, who have
been left of the captivity there in the province, \[are\] in great evil,
and in reproach, and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates
have been burnt with fire.'

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> And it cometh to pass, at my hearing these
words, I have sat down, and I weep and mourn \[for\] days, and I am
fasting and praying before the God of the heavens.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And I say, \`I beseech thee, O Jehovah, God
of the heavens, God, the great and the fearful, keeping the covenant and
kindness for those loving Him, and for those keeping His commands,

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> let Thine ear be, I pray Thee, attentive,
and Thine eyes open, to hearken unto the prayer of Thy servant, that I
am praying before Thee to-day, by day and by night, concerning the sons
of Israel Thy servants, and confessing concerning the sins of the sons
of Israel, that we have sinned against Thee; yea, I and the house of my
father have sinned;

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> we have acted very corruptly against Thee,
and have not kept the commands, and the statutes, and the judgments,
that Thou didst command Moses Thy servant.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> \`Remember, I pray Thee, the word that Thou
didst command Moses Thy servant, saying, Ye -- ye trespass -- I scatter
you among peoples;

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> and ye have turned back unto Me, and kept
My commands, and done them -- if your outcast is in the end of the
heavens, thence I gather them, and have brought them in unto the place
that I have chosen to cause My name to tabernacle there.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> And they \[are\] Thy servants, and Thy
people, whom Thou hast ransomed by Thy great power, and by Thy strong
hand.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> \`I beseech Thee, O Lord, let, I pray
Thee, Thine ear be attentive unto the prayer of Thy servant, and unto
the prayer of Thy servants, those delighting to fear Thy Name; and give
prosperity, I pray Thee, to Thy servant to-day, and give him for mercies
before this man;' and I have been butler to the king.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> And it cometh to pass, in the month of
Nisan, the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, wine \[is\] before
him, and I lift up the wine, and give to the king, and I had not been
sad before him;

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> and the king saith to me, \`Wherefore
\[is\] thy face sad, and thou not sick? this is nothing except sadness
of heart;' and I fear very much,

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> and say to the king, \`Let the king to the
age live! wherefore should not my face be sad, when the city, the place
of the graves of my fathers, \[is\] a waste, and its gates have been
consumed with fire?'

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> And the king saith to me, \`For what art
thou seeking?' and I pray unto the God of the heavens,

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> and say to the king, \`If to the king \[it
be\] good, and if thy servant be pleasing before thee, that thou send me
unto Judah, unto the city of the graves of my fathers, and I built it.'

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> And the king saith to me (and the queen is
sitting near him), \`How long is thy journey? and when dost thou
return?' and it is good before the king, and he sendeth me away, and I
set to him a time.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> And I say to the king, \`If to the king
\[it be\] good, letters let be given to me for the governors beyond the
River, that they let me pass over till that I come in unto Judah:

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> and a letter unto Asaph, keeper of the
paradise that the king hath, that he give to me trees for beams \[for\]
the gates of the palace that the house hath, and for the wall of the
city, and for the house into which I enter;' and the king giveth to me,
according to the good hand of my God upon me.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> And I come in unto the governors beyond the
River, and give to them the letters of the king; and the king sendeth
with me heads of a force, and horsemen;

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> and Sanballat the Horonite heareth, and
Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and it is evil to them -- a great evil
-- that a man hath come in to seek good for the sons of Israel.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> And I come in unto Jerusalem, and I am
there three days,

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> and I rise by night, I and a few men with
me, and have not declared to a man what my God is giving unto my heart
to do for Jerusalem, and there is no beast with me except the beast on
which I am riding.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And I go out through the gate of the
valley by night, and unto the front of the fountain of the dragon, and
unto the gate of the dunghill, and I am measuring about the walls of
Jerusalem, that are broken down, and its gates consumed with fire.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> And I pass over unto the gate of the
fountain, and unto the pool of the king, and there is no place for the
beast under me to pass over,

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> and I am going up through the brook by
night, and am measuring about the wall, and turn back, and come in
through the gate of the valley, and turn back.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> And the prefects have not known whither I
have gone, and what I am doing; and to the Jews, and to the priests, and
to the freemen, and to the prefects, and to the rest of those doing the
work, hitherto I have not declared \[it\];

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> and I say unto them, \`Ye are seeing the
evil that we are in, in that Jerusalem \[is\] waste, and its gates have
been burnt with fire; come and we build the wall of Jerusalem, and we
are not any more a reproach.'

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> And I declare to them the hand of my God
that is good upon me, and also the words of the king that he said to me,
and they say, \`Let us rise, and we have built;' and they strengthen
their hands for good.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> And Sanballat the Horonite heareth, and
Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, and they mock
at us, and despise us, and say, \`What \[is\] this thing that ye are
doing? against the king are ye rebelling?'

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> And I return them word, and say to them,
\`The God of the heavens -- He doth give prosperity to us, and we His
servants rise and have built; and to you there is no portion, and right,
and memorial in Jerusalem.'

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> And Eliashib the high priest riseth, and
his brethren the priests, and they build the sheep-gate; they have
sanctified it, and set up its doors, even unto the tower of Meah they
have sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel;

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> and by his hand have men of Jericho built;
and by their hand hath Zaccur son of Imri built;

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> and the fish-gate have sons of Hassenaah
built, they have walled it, and set up its doors, its locks, and its
bars.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> And by their hand hath Merimoth son of
Urijah, son of Koz, strengthened; and by his hand hath Meshullam son of
Berechiah, son of Meshezabeel, strengthened; and by his hand hath Zadok
son of Baana strengthened;

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> and by his hand have the Tekoites
strengthened, and their honourable ones have not brought in their neck
to the service of their Lord.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> And the old gate have Jehoiada son of
Paseah, and Meshullam son of Besodeiah, strengthened; they have walled
it, and set up its doors, and its locks, and its bars.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> And by their hand hath Melatiah the
Gibeonite strengthened, and Jadon the Meronothite, men of Gibeon and of
Mizpah, to the throne of the governor beyond the River.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> By his hand hath Uzziel son of Harhaiah of
the refiners strengthened; and by his hand hath Hananiah son of \[one
of\] the compounders strengthened; and they leave Jerusalem unto the
broad wall.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> And by their hand hath Rephaiah son of Hur,

Harim strengthened, and Hashub son of Pahath-Moab, even the tower of the
furnaces.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> And by his hand hath Shallum son of
Halohesh, head of the half of the district of Jerusalem, strengthened,
he and his daughters.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> The gate of the valley hath Hanun
strengthened, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they have built it, and set
up its doors, its locks, and its bars, and a thousand cubits in the wall
unto the dung-gate.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> And the dung-gate hath Malchijah son of

built it, and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> And the gate of the fountain hath Shallum
son of Col-Hozeh, head of the district of Mizpah, strengthened: he doth
build it, and cover it, and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars,
and the wall of the pool of Siloah, to the garden of the king, and unto
the steps that are going down from the city of David.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> After him hath Nehemiah son of Azbuk,
head of the half of the district of Beth-Zur, strengthened, unto
over-against the graves of David, and unto the pool that is made, and
unto the house of the mighty ones.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> After him have the Levites strengthened,
\[and\] Rehum son of Bani: by his hand hath Hashabiah, head of the half

district of Keilah.

of the house of Eliashib the high priest.

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> And after him have the priests, men of
the circuit, strengthened.

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> After them hath Benjamin strengthened,
and Hashub, over-against their house; after him hath Azariah son of
Maaseiah, son of Ananiah, strengthened, near his house.

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> After him hath Binnui son of Henadad

angle, and unto the corner.

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> Palal son of Uzai, from over-against the
angle, and the tower that is going out from the upper house of the king
that \[is\] at the court of the prison; after him Pedaiah son of Parosh.

<span id="an_3:26">3:26</span> And the Nethinim have been dwelling in
Ophel, unto over-against the water-gate at the east, and the tower that
goeth out.

<span id="an_3:27">3:27</span> After him have the Tekoites strengthened,
a second measure, from over-against the great tower that goeth out, and
unto the wall of Ophel.

<span id="an_3:28">3:28</span> From above the horse-gate have the
priests strengthened, each over-against his house.

<span id="an_3:29">3:29</span> After them hath Zadok son of Immer
strengthened, over against his house; and after him hath Shemaiah son of

<span id="an_3:31">3:31</span> After him hath Malchijah son of the
refiner strengthened, unto the house of the Nethinim, and of the
merchants, over-against the gate of the Miphkad, and unto the ascent of
the corner.

<span id="an_3:32">3:32</span> And between the ascent of the corner and
the sheep-gate, have the refiners and the merchants strengthened.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> And it cometh to pass, when Sanballat hath
heard that we are building the wall, that it is displeasing to him, and
he is very angry and mocketh at the Jews,

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> and saith before his brethren and the force
of Samaria, yea, he saith, \`What \[are\] the weak Jews doing? are they
left to themselves? do they sacrifice? do they complete in a day? do
they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish? -- and they
burnt!'

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> And Tobiah the Ammonite \[is\] by him and
saith, \`Also, that which they are building -- if a fox doth go up, then
it hath broken down their stone wall.'

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> Hear, O our God, for we have been despised;
and turn back their reproach on their own head, and give them for a
spoil in a land of captivity;

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> and do not cover over their iniquity, and
their sin from before Thee let not be blotted out, for they have
provoked to anger -- over-against those building.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> And we build the wall, and all the wall is
joined -- unto its half, and the people have a heart to work.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> And it cometh to pass, when Sanballat hath
heard, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the
Ashdodites, that lengthening hath gone up to the walls of Jerusalem,
that the breeches have begun to be stopped, then it is very displeasing
to them,

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> and they conspire, all of them together, to
come in to fight against Jerusalem, and to do to it injury.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> And we pray unto our God, and appoint a
watch against them, by day and by night, because of them.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> And Judah saith, \`The power of the
burden-bearers hath become feeble, and the rubbish \[is\] abundant, and
we are not able to build on the wall.'

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> And our adversaries say, \`They do not
know, nor see, till that we come in to their midst, and have slain them,
and caused the work to cease.'

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> And it cometh to pass, when the Jews have
come who are dwelling near them, that they say to us ten times from all
the places whither ye return -- \[they are\] against us.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> And I appoint at the lowest of the
places, at the back of the wall, in the clear places, yea, I appoint the
people, by their families, with their swords, their spears, and their
bows.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> And I see, and rise up, and say unto the
freemen, and unto the prefects, and unto the rest of the people, \`Be
not afraid of them; the Lord, the great and the fearful, remember ye,
and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives,
and your houses.'

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> And it cometh to pass, when our enemies
have heard that it hath been known to us, and God doth frustrate their
counsel, and we turn back, all of us, unto the wall, each unto his work;

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> yea, it cometh to pass, from that day,
half of my servants are working in the business, and half of them are
keeping hold of both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the
coats of mail; and the heads \[are\] behind all the house of Judah.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> The builders on the wall, and the bearers
of the burden, those lading, \[each\] with one of his hands is working
in the business, and one is laying hold of the missile.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> And the builders \[are\] each with his
sword, girded on his loins, and building, and he who is blowing with a
trumpet \[is\] beside me.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> And I say unto the freemen, and unto the
prefects, and unto the rest of the people, \`The work is abundant, and
large, and we are separated on the wall, far off one from another;

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> in the place that ye hear the voice of
the trumpet thither ye are gathered unto us; our God doth fight for us.'

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> And we are working in the business, and
half of them are keeping hold of the spears, from the going up of the
dawn till the coming forth of the stars.

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> Also, at that time I said to the people,
\`Let each with his servant lodge in the midst of Jerusalem, and they
have been to us by night a guard, and by day \[for\] the work:'

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> and there are none -- I and my brethren
and my servants, the men of the guard who \[are\] after me -- there are
none of us putting off our garments, each \[hath\] his vessel of water.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> And there is a great cry of the people and
their wives, concerning their brethren the Jews,

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> yea, there are who are saying, \`Our sons,
and our daughters, we -- are many, and we receive corn, and eat, and
live.'

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> And there are who are saying, \`Our fields,
and our vineyards, and our houses, we are pledging, and we receive corn
for the famine.'

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> And there are who are saying, \`We have
borrowed money for the tribute of the king, \[on\] our fields, and our
vineyards;

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> and now, as the flesh of our brethren
\[is\] our flesh, as their sons \[are\] our sons, and lo, we are
subduing our sons and our daughters for servants, and there are of our
daughters subdued, and our hand hath no might, and our fields and our
vineyards \[are\] to others.'

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> And it is very displeasing to me when I
have heard their cry and these words,

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> and my heart reigneth over me, and I strive
with the freemen, and with the prefects, and say to them, \`Usury one
upon another ye are exacting;' and I set against them a great assembly,

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> and say to them, \`We have acquired our
brethren the Jews, those sold to the nations, according to the ability
that \[is\] in us, and ye also sell your brethren, and they have been
sold to us!' and they are silent, and have not found a word.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> And I say, \`Not good \[is\] the thing that
ye are doing; in the fear of our God do ye not walk, because of the
reproach of the nations our enemies?

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> And also, I, my brethren, and my
servants, are exacting of them silver and corn; let us leave off, I pray
you, this usury.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> Give back, I pray you, to them, as
to-day, their fields, their vineyards, their olive-yards, and their
houses, and the hundredth \[part\] of the money, and of the corn, of the
new wine, and of the oil, that ye are exacting of them.'

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> And they say, \`We give back, and of them
we seek nothing; so we do as thou art saying.' And I call the priests,
and cause them to swear to do according to this thing;

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> also, my lap I have shaken, and I say,
\`Thus doth God shake out every man, who doth not perform this thing,
from his house, and from his labour; yea, thus is he shaken out and
empty;' and all the assembly say, \`Amen,' and praise Jehovah; and the
people do according to this thing.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> Also, from the day that he appointed me
to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even
unto the thirty and second year of Artaxerxes the king -- twelve years
-- I, and my brethren, the bread of the governor have not eaten:

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> the former governors who \[are\] before
me have made themselves heavy on the people, and take of them in bread
and wine, besides in silver forty shekels; also, their servants have
ruled over the people -- and I have not done so, because of the fear of
God.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> And also, in the work of this wall I have
done mightily, even a field we have not bought, and all my servants are
gathered there for the work;

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> and of the Jews, and of the prefects, a
hundred and fifty men, and those coming in unto us of the nations that
\[are\] round about us, \[are\] at my table;

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> and that which hath been prepared for one
day \[is\] one ox, six fat sheep, also fowls have been prepared for me,
and once in ten days of all wines abundantly, and with this, the bread
of the governor I have not sought, for heavy is the service on this
people.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> Remember for me, O my God, for good, all
that I have done for this people.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> And it cometh to pass, when it hath been
heard by Sanballat, and Tobiah, and by Geshem the Arabian, and by the
rest of our enemies, that I have builded the wall, and there hath not
been left in it a breach, (also, till that time the doors I had not set
up in the gates,)

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> that Sanballat sendeth, also Geshem, unto
me, saying, \`Come and we meet together in the villages, in the valley
of Ono;' and they are thinking to do to me evil.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> And I send unto them messengers, saying,
\`A great work I am doing, and I am not able to come down; why doth the
work cease when I let it alone, and have come down unto you?'

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> and they send unto me, according to this
word, four times, and I return them \[word\] according to this word.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> And Sanballat sendeth unto me, according to
this word, a fifth time, his servant, and an open letter in his hand;

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> it is written in it, \`Among the nations it
hath been heard, and Gashmu is saying: Thou and the Jews are thinking to
rebel, therefore thou art building the wall, and thou hast been to them
for a king -- according to these words!

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> And also, prophets thou hast appointed to
call for thee in Jerusalem, saying, A king \[is\] in Judah, and now it
is heard by the king according to these words; and now come, and we take
counsel together.'

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> And I send unto him, saying, \`It hath not
been according to these words that thou art saying, for from thine own
heart thou art devising them;'

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> for all of them are making us afraid,
saying, \`Their hands are too feeble for the work, and it is not done;'
and now, strengthen Thou my hands.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> And I have entered the house of Shemaiah
son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabeel -- and he is restrained -- and he
saith, \`Let us meet at the house of God, at the inside of the temple,
and we shut the doors of the temple, for they are coming in to slay thee
-- yea, by night they are coming in to slay thee.'

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> And I say, \`A man such as I -- doth he
flee? and who as I, that doth go in unto the temple, and live? -- I do
not go in.'

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> And I discern, and lo, God hath not sent
him, for in the prophecy he hath spoken unto me both Tobiah and
Sanballat hired him,

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> so that he \[is\] an hireling, that I may
fear and do so, and I had sinned, and it had been to them for an evil
name that they may reproach me.

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> Be mindful, O my God, of Tobiah, and of
Sanballat, according to these his works, and also, of Noadiah the
prophetess, and of the rest of the prophets who have been making me
afraid.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> And the wall is completed in the twenty
and fifth of Elul, on the fifty and second day;

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> and it cometh to pass, when all our
enemies have heard, and all the nations who are round about us see, that
they fall greatly in their own eyes, and know that by our God hath this
work been done.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> Also, in those days the freemen of Judah
are multiplying their letters going unto Tobiah, and those of Tobiah are
coming in unto them;

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> for many in Judah are sworn to him, for
he \[is\] son-in-law to Shechaniah son of Arah, and Jehohanan his son
hath taken the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah;

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> also, his good deeds they have been
saying before me, and my words they have been taking out to him; letters
hath Tobiah sent to make me afraid.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> And it cometh to pass, when the wall hath
been built, that I set up the doors, and the gatekeepers are appointed,
and the singers, and the Levites,

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> and I charge Hanani my brother, and
Hananiah head of the palace, concerning Jerusalem -- for he \[is\] as a
man of truth, and fearing God above many --

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> and I say to them, \`Let not the gates of
Jerusalem be opened till the heat of the sun, and while they are
standing by let them shut the doors, and fasten, and appoint guards of
the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each in his guard, and each over-against
his house.'

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> And the city \[is\] broad on both sides,
and great, and the people \[are\] few in its midst, and there are no
houses builded;

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> and my God putteth it unto my heart, and I
gather the freeman, and the prefects, and the people, for the genealogy,
and I find a book of the genealogy of those coming up at the beginning,
and I find written in it: --

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> These \[are\] sons of the province, those
coming up of the captives of the removal that Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon removed -- and they turn back to Jerusalem and to Judah, each to
his city --

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> who are coming in with Zerubbabel, Jeshua,

those reckoning themselves by genealogy, and it hath not been found, and
they are redeemed from the priesthood,

<span id="an_7:65">7:65</span> and the Tirshatha saith to them that they
eat not of the most holy things till the standing up of the priest with
Urim and Thummim.

<span id="an_7:66">7:66</span> All the assembly together \[is\] four
myriads two thousand three hundred and sixty,

<span id="an_7:67">7:67</span> apart from their servants and their

<span id="an_7:71">7:71</span> And of the heads of the fathers they have

<span id="an_7:72">7:72</span> And that which the rest of the people
have given \[is\] of gold, drams two myriads, and of silver, pounds two
thousand, and of priests coats, sixty and seven.

<span id="an_7:73">7:73</span> And they dwell -- the priests, and the
Levites, and the gatekeepers, and the singers, and \[some\] of the
people, and the Nethinim, and all Israel -- in their cities, and the
seventh month cometh, and the sons of Israel \[are\] in their cities.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> And all the people are gathered as one man
unto the broad place that \[is\] before the water-gate, and they say to
Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, that Jehovah
commanded Israel.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> And Ezra the priest bringeth the law before
the assembly, both of men and women, and every one intelligent to hear,
on the first day of the seventh month,

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> and he readeth in it before the broad place
that \[is\] before the water-gate, from the light till the middle of the
day, over-against the men, and the women, and those intelligent, and the
ears of all the people \[are\] unto the book of the law.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> And Ezra the scribe standeth on a tower of
wood that they made for the purpose, and Mattithiah standeth near him,
and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his
right; and on his left Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchijah, and Hashum,
and Hashbaddana, Zechariah, Meshullam.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> And Ezra openeth the book before the eyes
of all the people -- for above all the people he hath been -- and at his
opening \[it\] all the people have stood up,

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> and Ezra blesseth Jehovah, the great God,
and all the people answer, \`Amen, Amen,' with lifting up of their
hands, and they bow and do obeisance to Jehovah -- faces to the earth.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> And Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin,
Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan,
Pelaiah, and the Levites, giving the people understanding in the law,
and the people, \[are\] on their station,

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> and they read in the book, in the law of
God, explaining -- so as to give the meaning, and they give
understanding to the convocation.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> And Nehemiah -- he \[is\] the Tirshatha --
saith (and Ezra the priest, the scribe, and the Levites who are
instructing the people) to all the people, \`To-day is holy to Jehovah
your God, do not mourn, nor weep:' for all the people are weeping at
their hearing the words of the law.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> And he saith to them, \`Go, eat fat
things, and drink sweet things, and sent portions to him for whom
nothing is prepared, for to-day \[is\] holy to our Lord, and be not
grieved, for the joy of Jehovah is your strength.'

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> And the Levites are keeping all the
people silent, saying, \`Be silent, for to-day \[is\] holy, and be not
grieved.'

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> And all the people go to eat, and to
drink, and to send portions, and to make great joy, because they have
understood concerning the words that they made known to them.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> And on the second day have been gathered
heads of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites,
unto Ezra the scribe, even to act wisely concerning the words of the
law.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> And they find written in the law that
Jehovah commanded by the hand of Moses, that the sons of Israel dwell in
booths in the feast, in the seventh month,

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> and that they proclaim and cause to pass
over all their cities, (and in Jerusalem,) saying, \`Go ye out to the
mount, and bring leaves of the olive, and leaves of the oil tree, and
leaves of the myrtle, and leaves of the palms, and leaves of thick
trees, to make booths as it is written.'

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> And the people go out, and bring in, and
make for themselves booths, each on his roof, and in their courts, and
in the courts of the house of God, and in the broad place of the
water-gate, and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim.

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> And they make -- all the assembly of the
captives of the captivity -- booths, and they sit in booths; for the
sons of Israel had not done, from the days of Jeshua son of Nun, so unto
that day, and there is very great joy.

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> And he readeth in the book of the law of
God day by day, from the first day till the last day, and they make a
feast seven days, and on the eighth day a restraint, according to the
ordinance.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> And in the twenty and fourth day of this
month have the sons of Israel been gathered, with fasting, and with
sackcloth, and earth upon them;

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> and the seed of Israel are separated from
all sons of a stranger, and stand and confess concerning their sins, and
the iniquities of their fathers,

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> and rise up on their station, and read in
the book of the law of Jehovah their God a fourth of the day, and a
fourth they are confessing and bowing themselves to Jehovah their God.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> And there stand up on the ascent, of the
Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani,
Chenani, and they cry with a loud voice unto Jehovah their God.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> And the Levites say, \[even\] Jeshua, and
Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, Pethahiah,
\`Rise, bless Jehovah your God, from the age unto the age, and they
bless the name of Thine honour that \[is\] exalted above all blessing
and praise.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> Thou \[art\] He, O Jehovah, Thyself -- Thou
hast made the heavens, the heavens of the heavens, and all their host,
the earth and all that \[are\] on it, the seas and all that \[are\] in
them, and Thou art keeping all of them alive, and the host of the
heavens to Thee are bowing themselves.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> \`Thou \[art\] He, O Jehovah God, who didst
fix on Abraham, and didst bring him out from Ur of the Chaldeans, and
didst make his name Abraham,

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> and didst find his heart stedfast before
Thee, so as to make with him the covenant, to give the land of the
Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the
Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give \[it\] to his seed. \`And Thou
dost establish Thy words, for Thou \[art\] righteous,

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> and dost see the affliction of our fathers
in Egypt, and their cry hast heard by the sea of Suph,

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> and dost give signs and wonders on
Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land, for
Thou hast known that they have acted proudly against them, and Thou
makest to Thee a name as \[at\] this day.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> And the sea Thou hast cleaved before
them, and they pass over into the midst of the sea on the dry land, and
their pursuers Thou hast cast into the depths, as a stone, into the
strong waters.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> And by a pillar of cloud Thou hast led
them by day, and by a pillar of fire by night, to lighten to them the
way in which they go.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> \`And on mount Sinai Thou hast come down,
even to speak with them from the heavens, and Thou dost give to them
right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commands.

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> And Thy holy sabbath Thou hast made known
to them, and commands, and statutes, and law, Thou hast commanded for
them, by the hand of Moses Thy servant;

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> and bread from the heavens Thou hast
given to them for their hunger, and water from a rock hast brought out
to them for their thirst, and dost say to them to go in to possess the
land that Thou hast lifted up Thy hand to give to them.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> \`And they and our fathers have acted
proudly, and harden their neck, and have not hearkened unto Thy
commands,

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> yea, they refuse to hearken, and have not
remembered Thy wonders that Thou hast done with them, and harden their
neck and appoint a head, to turn back to their service, in their
rebellion; and Thou \[art\] a God of pardons, gracious, and merciful,
long-suffering, and abundant in kindness, and hast not forsaken them.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> \`Also, when they have made to themselves
a molten calf, and say, this \[is\] thy god that brought thee up out of
Egypt, and do great despisings,

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> and Thou, in Thine abundant mercies, hast
not forsaken them in the wilderness -- the pillar of the cloud hath not
turned aside from off them by day, to lead them in the way, and the
pillar of the fire by night, to give light to them and the way in which
they go.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> \`And Thy good Spirit Thou hast given, to
cause them to act wisely; and Thy manna Thou hast not withheld from
their mouth, and water Thou hast given to them for their thirst,

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> and forty years Thou hast nourished them
in a wilderness; they have not lacked; their garments have not worn out,
and their feet have not swelled.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> \`And Thou givest to them kingdoms, and
peoples, and dost apportion them to the corner, and they possess the
land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og
king of Bashan.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> And their sons Thou hast multiplied as
the stars of the heavens, and bringest them in unto the land that Thou
hast said to their fathers to go in to possess.

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> \`And the sons come in, and possess the
land, and Thou humblest before them the inhabitants of the land, the
Canaanites, and givest them into their hand, and their kings, and the
peoples of the land, to do with them according to their pleasure.

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> And they capture fenced cities, and fat
ground, and possess houses full of all good, digged-wells, vineyards,
and olive-yards, and fruit-trees in abundance, and they eat, and are
satisfied, and become fat, and delight themselves in Thy great goodness.

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> \`And they are disobedient, and rebel
against Thee, and cast Thy law behind their back, and Thy prophets they
have slain, who testified against them, to bring them back unto Thee,
and they do great despisings,

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> and Thou givest them into the hand of
their adversaries, and they distress them, and in the time of their
distress they cry unto Thee, and Thou, from the heavens, dost hear, and,
according to Thine abundant mercies, dost give to them saviours, and
they save them out of the hand of their adversaries.

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> \`And when they have rest, they turn back
to do evil before Thee, and Thou dost leave them in the hand of their
enemies, and they rule over them; and they turn back, and call Thee, and
Thou from the heavens dost hear, and dost deliver them, according to Thy
mercies, many times,

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> and dost testify against them, to bring
them back unto Thy law; and they -- they have acted proudly, and have
not hearkened to Thy commands, and against Thy judgments have sinned, --
which man doth and hath lived in them -- and they give a refractory
shoulder, and their neck have hardened, and have not hearkened.

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> \`And Thou drawest over them many years,
and testifiest against them by Thy Spirit, by the hand of Thy prophets,
and they have not given ear, and Thou dost give them into the hand of
peoples of the lands,

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> and in Thine abundant mercies Thou hast
not made them a consumption, nor hast forsaken them; for a God, gracious
and merciful, \[art\] Thou.

<span id="an_9:32">9:32</span> \`And now, O our God -- God, the great,
the mighty, and the fearful, keeping the covenant and the kindness --
let not all the travail that hath found us be little before Thee, for
our kings, for our heads, and for our priests, and for our prophets, and
for our fathers, and for all Thy people, from the days of the kings of
Asshur unto this day;

<span id="an_9:33">9:33</span> and Thou \[art\] righteous concerning all
that hath come upon us, for truth Thou hast done, and we have done
wickedly;

<span id="an_9:34">9:34</span> and our kings, our heads, our priests,
and our fathers, have not done Thy law, nor attended unto Thy commands,
and to Thy testimonies, that Thou hast testified against them;

<span id="an_9:35">9:35</span> and they, in their kingdom, and in Thine
abundant goodness, that Thou hast given to them, and in the land, the
large and the fat, that Thou hast set before them, have not served Thee,
nor turned back from their evil doings.

<span id="an_9:36">9:36</span> \`Lo, we -- to-day -- \[are\] servants,
and the land that Thou hast given to our fathers, to eat its fruit and
its good -- lo, we \[are\] servants on it,

<span id="an_9:37">9:37</span> and its increase it is multiplying to the
kings whom Thou hast set over us in our sins; and over our bodies they
are ruling, and over our cattle, according to their pleasure, and we
\[are\] in great distress.

<span id="an_9:38">9:38</span> And for all this we are making a stedfast
covenant, and are writing, and over him who is sealed \[are\] our heads,
our Levites, our priests.'

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> And over those sealed \[are\] Nehemiah

priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the Nethinim, and
every one who hath been separated from the peoples of the lands unto the
law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, every knowing
intelligent one,

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> are laying hold on their brethren,
their honourable ones, and coming in to an execration, and in to an
oath, to walk in the law of God, that was given by the hand of Moses,
servant of God, and to observe and to do all the commands of Jehovah our
Lord, and His judgments, and His statutes;

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> and that we give not our daughters to
the peoples of the land, and their daughters we take not to our sons;

<span id="an_10:31">10:31</span> and the peoples of the land who are
bringing in the wares and any corn on the sabbath-day to sell, we
receive not of them on the sabbath, and on a holy day, and we leave the
seventh year, and usury on every hand.

<span id="an_10:32">10:32</span> And we have appointed for ourselves
commands, to put on ourselves the third of a shekel in a year, for the
service of the house of our God,

<span id="an_10:33">10:33</span> for bread of the arrangement, and the
continual present, and the continual burnt-offering of the sabbaths, of
the new moons, for appointed seasons, and for holy things, and for
sin-offerings, to make atonement for Israel, even all the work of the
house of our God.

<span id="an_10:34">10:34</span> And the lots we have caused to fall for
the offering of wood, \[among\] the priests, the Levites, and the
people, to bring in to the house of our God, by the house of our
fathers, at times appointed, year by year, to burn on the altar of
Jehovah our God, as it is written in the law,

<span id="an_10:35">10:35</span> and to bring in the first fruits of our
ground, and the first fruits of all fruit of every tree, year by year,
to the house of Jehovah,

<span id="an_10:36">10:36</span> and the firstlings of our sons, and of
our cattle, as it is written in the law, and the firstlings of our herds
and our flocks, to bring in to the house of our God, to the priests who
are ministering in the house of our God.

<span id="an_10:37">10:37</span> And the beginning of our dough, and our
heave-offerings, and the fruit of every tree, of new wine, and of oil,
we bring in to the priests, unto the chambers of the house of our God,
and the tithe of our ground to the Levites; and they -- the Levites --
have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage;

<span id="an_10:38">10:38</span> and the priest, son of Aaron, hath been
with the Levites in the tithing of the Levites, and the Levites bring up
the tithe of the tithe to the house of our God unto the chambers, to the
treasure-house;

<span id="an_10:39">10:39</span> for unto the chambers do they bring in
-- the sons of Israel and the sons of Levi -- the heave-offering of the
corn, the new wine, and the oil, and there \[are\] vessels of the
sanctuary, and the priests, those ministering, and the gatekeepers, and
the singers, and we do not forsake the house of our God.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> And the heads of the people dwell in
Jerusalem, and the rest of the people have caused to fall lots to bring
in one out of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts in

Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, are written, heads of fathers, and of
the priests, in the kingdom of Darius the Persian.

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> Sons of Levi, heads of the fathers, are
written on the book of the Chronicles even till the days of Johanan son
of Eliashib;

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> and heads of the Levites: Hashabiah,
Sherebiah, and Jeshua son of Kadmiel, and their brethren, \[are\]
over-against them, to give praise, to give thanks, by command of David

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah,
Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, \[are\] gatekeepers, keeping charge in the
gatherings of the gates.

son of Jeshua, son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor,
and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> And at the dedication of the wall of
Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them
in to Jerusalem, to make the dedication even with gladness, and with
thanksgivings, and with singing, \[with\] cymbals, psalteries, and with
harps;

<span id="an_12:28">12:28</span> and sons of the singers are gathered
together even from the circuit round about Jerusalem, and from the
villages of Netophathi,

<span id="an_12:29">12:29</span> and from the house of Gilgal, and from
fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for villages have the singers built for
themselves round about Jerusalem;

<span id="an_12:30">12:30</span> and the priests and the Levites are
cleansed, and they cleanse the people, and the gates, and the wall.

<span id="an_12:31">12:31</span> And I bring up the heads of Judah upon
the wall, and appoint two great thanksgiving companies and processions.
At the right, on the wall, to the dung-gate;

<span id="an_12:32">12:32</span> and after them goeth Hoshaiah, and half
of the heads of Judah,

<span id="an_12:33">12:33</span> and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,

<span id="an_12:34">12:34</span> Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and
Jeremiah;

<span id="an_12:35">12:35</span> and of the sons of the priests with
trumpets, Zechariah son of Jonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mattaniah,
son of Michaiah, son of Zaccur, son of Asaph,

<span id="an_12:36">12:36</span> and his brethren Shemaiah, and Azarael,
Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with instruments
of song of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe \[is\] before them;

<span id="an_12:37">12:37</span> and by the gate of the fountain and
over-against them, they have gone up by the steps of the city of David,
at the going up of the wall beyond the house of David, and unto the
water-gate eastward.

<span id="an_12:38">12:38</span> And the second thanksgiving company
that is going over-against, and I after it, and half of the people on
the wall from beyond the tower of the furnaces and unto the broad wall,

<span id="an_12:39">12:39</span> and from beyond the gate of Ephraim,
and by the old-gate, and by the fish-gate, and the tower of Hananeel,
and the tower of Meah, and unto the sheep-gate -- and they have stood at
the prison-gate.

<span id="an_12:40">12:40</span> And the two thanksgiving companies
stand in the house of God, and I and half of the prefects with me,

<span id="an_12:41">12:41</span> and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah,
Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, Hananiah, with trumpets,

<span id="an_12:42">12:42</span> and Masseiah, and Shemaiah, and
Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer, and
the singers sound, and Jezrahiah the inspector;

<span id="an_12:43">12:43</span> and they sacrifice on that day great
sacrifices and rejoice, for God hath made them rejoice \[with\] great
joy, and also, the women and the children have rejoiced, and the joy of
Jerusalem is heard -- unto a distance.

<span id="an_12:44">12:44</span> And certain are appointed on that day
over the chambers for treasures, for heave-offerings, for first-fruits,
and for tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the
portions of the law for priests, and for Levites, for the joy of Judah
\[is\] over the priests, and over the Levites, who are standing up.

<span id="an_12:45">12:45</span> And the singers and the gatekeepers
keep the charge of their God, even the charge of the cleansing --
according to the command of David \[and\] Solomon his son,

<span id="an_12:46">12:46</span> for in the days of David and Asaph of
old \[were\] heads of the singers, and a song of praise and thanksgiving
to God.

<span id="an_12:47">12:47</span> And all Israel in the days of
Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, are giving the portions of the
singers, and of the gatekeepers, the matter of a day in its day, and are
sanctifying to the Levites, and the Levites are sanctifying to the sons
of Aaron.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> On that day there was read in the book of
Moses, in the ears of the people, and it hath been found written in it
that an Ammonite and Moabite doth not come into the assembly of God --
unto the age,

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> because they have not come before the
sons of Israel with bread and with water, and hire against them Balaam
to revile them, and our God turneth the reviling into a blessing.

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> And it cometh to pass, at their hearing
the law, that they separate all the mixed people from Israel.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> And before this Eliashib the priest,
appointed over chambers of the house of our God, \[is\] a relation of
Tobiah,

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> and he maketh for him a great chamber,
and there they were formerly putting the present, the frankincense, and
the vessels, and the tithe of the corn, the new wine, and the oil -- the
commanded thing of the Levites, and the singers, and the gatekeepers --
and the heave-offering of the priests.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> And during all this I was not in
Jerusalem, for in the thirty and second year of Artaxerxes king of
Babylon did I come unto the king, and at the end of days I have asked of
the king,

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> and I come in to Jerusalem, and
understand concerning the evil that Eliashib hath done for Tobiah, to
make to him a chamber in the courts of the house of God,

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> and it is very displeasing to me, and I
cast all the vessels of the house of Tobiah without, out of the chamber,

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> and I speak, and they cleanse the
chambers, and I bring back thither the vessels of the house of God with
the present and the frankincense.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> And I know that the portions of the
Levites have not been given, and they flee each to his field -- the
Levites and the singers, doing the work.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> And I strive with the prefects, and
say, \`Wherefore hath the house of God been forsaken?' and I gather
them, and set them on their station;

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> and all Judah have brought in the tithe
of the corn, and of the new wine, and of the oil, to the treasuries.

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> And I appoint treasurers over the
treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of
the Levites; and by their hand \[is\] Hanan son of Zaccur, son of
Mattaniah, for stedfast they have been reckoned, and on them \[it is\]
to give a portion to their brethren.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> Be mindful of me, O my God, for this,
and do not blot out my kind acts that I have done, for the house of my
God, and for its charges.

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> In those days I have seen in Judah
those treading wine-vats on sabbath, and bringing in the sheaves, and
lading on the asses, and also, wine, grapes, and figs, and every burden,
yea, they are bringing in to Jerusalem on the sabbath-day, and I testify
in the day of their selling provision.

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> And the Tyrians have dwelt in it,
bringing in fish, and every ware, and selling on sabbath to the sons of
Judah and in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> And I strive with the freemen of Judah,
and say to them, \`What \[is\] this evil thing that ye are doing, and
polluting the sabbath-day?

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> Thus did not your fathers do? and our
God bringeth in on us all this evil, and on this city, and ye are adding
fierceness on Israel, to pollute the sabbath.'

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> And it cometh to pass, when the gates
of Jerusalem have been dark before the sabbath, that I speak, and the
doors are shut, and I say, that they do not open them till after the
sabbath; and of my servants I have stationed at the gates; there doth
not come in a burden on the sabbath-day.

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> And they lodge -- the merchants and
sellers of all ware -- at the outside of Jerusalem, once or twice,

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> and I testify against them, and say
unto them, \`Wherefore are ye lodging over-against the wall? if ye
repeat \[it\], a hand I put forth upon you;' from that time they have
not come in on the sabbath.

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> And I say to the Levites, that they be
cleansed, and, coming in, keeping the gates, to sanctify the
sabbath-day. Also, this, remember for me, O my God, and have pity on me,
according to the abundance of Thy kindness.

<span id="an_13:23">13:23</span> Also, in those days, I have seen the
Jews \[who\] have settled women of Ashdod, of Ammon, of Moab.

<span id="an_13:24">13:24</span> And of their sons, half are speaking
Ashdoditish -- and are not knowing to speak Jewish -- and according to
the language of people and people.

<span id="an_13:25">13:25</span> And I strive with them, and declare
them vile, and smite certain of them, and pluck off their hair, and
cause them to swear by God, \`Ye do not give your daughters to their
sons, nor do ye take of their daughters to your sons, and to yourselves.

<span id="an_13:26">13:26</span> \`By these did not Solomon king of
Israel sin? and among the many nations there was no king like him, and
beloved by his God he was, and God maketh him king over all Israel --
even him did the strange women cause to sin.

<span id="an_13:27">13:27</span> And to you do we hearken to do all this
great evil, to trespass against our God, to settle strange women?'

<span id="an_13:28">13:28</span> And \[one\] of the sons of Joiada son
of Eliashib the high priest, \[is\] son-in-law to Sanballat the
