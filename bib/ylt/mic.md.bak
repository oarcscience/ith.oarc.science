### Young's Literal Translation: Micah

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> A word of Jehovah that hath been unto Micah
the Morashite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah,
that he hath seen concerning Samaria and Jerusalem:

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Hear, O peoples, all of them! Attend, O
earth, and its fulness, And the Lord Jehovah is against you for a
witness, The Lord from His holy temple.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> For lo, Jehovah is going out from His
place, And He hath come down, And hath trodden on high places of earth.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> Melted have been the mountains under Him,
And the valleys do rend themselves, As wax from the presence of fire, As
waters cast down by a slope.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> For the transgression of Jacob \[is\] all
this, And for the sins of the house of Israel. What \[is\] the
transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what the high places of
Judah? Is it not Jerusalem?

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And I have set Samaria for a heap of the
field, For plantations of a vineyard, And poured out into a valley her
stones, And her foundations I uncover.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> And all her graven images are beaten down,
And all her gifts are burnt with fire, And all her idols I make a
desolation, For, from the hire of a harlot she gathered, and unto the
hire of a harlot they return.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> For this I lament and howl, I go spoiled
and naked, I make a lamentation like dragons, And a mourning like
daughters of an ostrich.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> For mortal \[are\] her wounds, For it hath
come unto Judah, It hath come to a gate of My people -- to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> In Gath tell ye not -- in Acco weep not,
In Beth-Aphrah, in dust roll thyself.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Pass over for thee, O inhabitant of
Shaphir, Naked one of shame. Not gone out hath the inhabitant of Zaanan,
The lamentation of Beth-Ezel doth take from you its standing.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> For stayed for good hath the inhabitant
of Maroth, For evil hath come down from Jehovah to the gate of
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Bind the chariot to a swift beast, O
inhabitant of Lachish, The beginning of sin \[is\] she to the daughter
of Zion, For in thee have been found the transgressions of Israel.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> Therefore thou givest presents to
Moresheth-Gath, The houses of Achzib become a lying thing to the kings
of Israel.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> Yet the possessor I do bring in to thee,
O inhabitant of Mareshah, To Adullam come in doth the honour of Israel.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> Make bald and shave, for thy delightful
sons, Enlarge thy baldness as an eagle, For they have removed from thee!

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Wo \[to\] those devising iniquity, And
working evil on their beds, In the light of the morning they do it, For
their hand is -- to God.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> And they have desired fields, And they have
taken violently, And houses, and they have taken away, And have
oppressed a man and his house, Even a man and his inheritance.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> Therefore, thus said Jehovah: Lo, I am
devising against this family evil, From which ye do not remove your
necks, Nor walk loftily, for a time of evil it \[is\].

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> In that day doth \[one\] take up for you a
simile, And he hath wailed a wailing of wo, He hath said, We have been
utterly spoiled, The portion of my people He doth change, How doth He
move toward me! To the backslider our fields He apportioneth.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Therefore, thou hast no caster of a line by
lot In the assembly of Jehovah.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> Ye do not prophesy -- they do prophesy,
They do not prophesy to these, It doth not remove shame.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> Doth the house of Jacob say, \`Hath the
Spirit of Jehovah been shortened? Are these His doings?' Do not My words
benefit the people that is walking uprightly?

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> And yesterday My people for an enemy doth
raise himself up, From the outer garment the honourable ornament ye
strip off, From the confident passers by, Ye who are turning back from
war.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> The women of My people ye cast out from its
delightful house, From its sucklings ye take away My honour to the age.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> Rise and go, for this \[is\] not the
rest, Because of uncleanness it doth corrupt, And corruption is
powerful.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> If one is going \[with\] the wind, And
\[with\] falsehood hath lied: \`I prophesy to thee of wine, and of
strong drink,' He hath been the prophet of this people!

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> I do surely gather thee, O Jacob, all of
thee, I surely bring together the remnant of Israel, Together I do set
it as the flock of Bozrah, As a drove in the midst of its pasture, It
maketh a noise because of man.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> Gone up hath the breaker before them,
They have broken through, Yea, they pass through the gate, Yea, they go
out through it, And pass on doth their king before them, And Jehovah at
their head!

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> And I say, \`Hear, I pray you, heads of
Jacob, And ye judges of the house of Israel, Is it not for you to know
the judgment?

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> Ye who are hating good, and loving evil,
Taking violently their skin from off them, And their flesh from off
their bones,

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> And who have eaten the flesh of My people,
And their skin from off them have stript, And their bones they have
broken, And they have spread \[them\] out as in a pot, And as flesh in
the midst of a caldron.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> Then do they cry unto Jehovah, And He doth
not answer them, And hideth His face from them at that time, As they
have made evil their doings.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Thus said Jehovah concerning the prophets
Who are causing My people to err, Who are biting with their teeth, And
have cried \`Peace,' And he who doth not give unto their mouth, They
have sanctified against him war.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> Therefore a night ye have without vision,
And darkness ye have without divination, And gone in hath the sun on the
prophets, And black over them hath been the day.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> And ashamed have been the seers, And
confounded have been the diviners, And covered their lip have all of
them, For their is no answer, O God.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> And yet I have been full of power by the
Spirit of Jehovah, And of judgment, and of might, To declare to Jacob
his transgression, And to Israel his sin.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> Hear this, I pray you, heads of the house
of Jacob, And ye judges of the house of Israel, Who are making judgment
abominable, And all uprightness do pervert.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> Building up Zion with blood, And
Jerusalem with iniquity.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Her heads for a bribe do judge, And her
priests for hire do teach, And her prophets for silver divine, And on
Jehovah they lean, saying, \`Is not Jehovah in our midst? Evil doth not
come in upon us.'

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Therefore, for your sake, Zion is
ploughed a field, and Jerusalem is heaps, And the mount of the house
\[is\] for high places of a forest!

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> And it hath come to pass, In the latter end
of the days, The mount of the house of Jehovah Is established above the
top of the mounts, And it hath been lifted up above the hills, And
flowed unto it have peoples.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> And gone have many nations and said, Come
and we go up to the mount of Jehovah, And unto the house of the God of
Jacob, And He doth teach us of His ways, And we do walk in His paths,
For from Zion doth go forth a law, And a word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> And He hath judged between many peoples,
And given a decision to mighty nations afar off, They have beaten their
swords to ploughshares, And their spears to pruning-hooks, Nation
lifteth not up sword unto nation, Nor do they learn war any more.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> And they have sat each under his vine, And
under his fig-tree, And there is none troubling, For the mouth of
Jehovah of Hosts hath spoken.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> For all the peoples do walk, Each in the
name of its god -- and we, We do walk in the name of Jehovah our God, To
the age and for ever.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> In that day -- an affirmation of Jehovah, I
do gather the halting one, And the driven away one I bring together, And
she whom I have afflicted.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> And I have set the halting for a remnant,
And the far-off for a mighty nation, And reigned hath Jehovah over them
in mount Zion, From henceforth, and unto the age.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> And thou, O tower of Eder, Fort of the
daughter of Zion, unto thee it cometh, Yea, come in hath the former
rule, The kingdom to the daughter of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> Now, why dost thou shout aloud? A king --
is there none in thee? Hath thy counsellor perished, That taken hold of
thee hath pain as a travailing woman?

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> Be pained, and bring forth, O daughter of
Zion, As a travailing woman, For now, thou goest forth from the city,
And thou hast dwelt in the field, And thou hast gone unto Babylon, There
thou art delivered, There redeem thee doth Jehovah from the hand of
thine enemies.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> And now, gathered against thee have been
many nations, who are saying: \`Let her be defiled, and our eyes look on
Zion.'

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> They have not known the thoughts of
Jehovah, Nor have they understood His counsel, For He hath gathered them
as a sheaf \[into\] a threshing-floor.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> Arise, and thresh, O daughter of Zion,
For thy horn I make iron, And thy hoofs I make brass, And thou hast
beaten small many peoples, And I have devoted to Jehovah their gain, And
their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth!

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Now gather thyself together, O daughter of
troops, A siege he hath laid against us, With a rod they smite on the
cheek the judge of Israel.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> And thou, Beth-Lehem Ephratah, Little to be
among the chiefs of Judah! From thee to Me he cometh forth -- to be
ruler in Israel, And his comings forth \[are\] of old, From the days of
antiquity.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> Therefore he doth give them out till the
time She who bringeth forth hath brought forth, And the remnant of his
brethren return to the sons of Israel.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> And he hath stood and delighted in the
strength of Jehovah, In the excellency of the name of Jehovah his God,
And they have remained, For now he is great unto the ends of earth.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> And this \[one\] hath been peace, Asshur!
when he doth come into our land, And when he doth tread in our palaces,
We have raised against him seven shepherds, And eight anointed of man.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> And they have afflicted the land of Asshur
with the sword, And the land of Nimrod at its openings, And he hath
delivered from Asshur when he doth come into our land, And when he
treadeth in our borders.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> And the remnant of Jacob hath been in the
midst of many peoples, As dew from Jehovah -- as showers on the herb,
That waiteth not for man, nor stayeth for the sons of men.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> Yea, the remnant of Jacob hath been among
nations, In the midst of many peoples, As a lion among beasts of a
forest, As a young lion among ranks of a flock, Which if it hath passed
through, Hath both trodden down and hath torn, And there is no
deliverer.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> High is thy hand above thine adversaries,
And all thine enemies are cut off.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> And it hath come to pass in that day, An
affirmation of Jehovah, I have cut off thy horses from thy midst, And I
have destroyed thy chariots,

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> And I have cut off the cities of thy
land, And I have thrown down all thy fortresses,

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> And have cut off sorcerers out of thy
hand, And observers of clouds thou hast none.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> And I have cut off thy graven images, And
thy standing-pillars out of thy midst, And thou dost not bow thyself any
more To the work of thy hands.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> And I have plucked up thy shrines out of
thy midst, And I have destroyed thine enemies.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> And I have done vengeance in anger and in
fury, With the nations who have not hearkened!

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Hear, I pray you, that which Jehovah is
saying: \`Rise -- strive thou with the mountains, And cause thou the
hills to hear thy voice.'

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Hear, O mountains, the strife of Jehovah,
Ye strong ones -- foundations of earth! For a strife \[is\] to Jehovah,
with His people, And with Israel He doth reason.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> O My people, what have I done to thee? And
what -- have I wearied thee? Testify against Me.

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> For I brought thee up from the land of
Egypt, And from the house of servants I have ransomed thee, And I send
before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> O My people, remember, I pray you, What
counsel did Balak king of Moab, What answer him did Balaam son of Beor,
(From Shittim unto Gilgal,) In order to know the righteous acts of
Jehovah.'

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> With what do I come before Jehovah? Do I
bow to God Most High? Do I come before Him with burnt-offerings? With
calves -- sons of a year?

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> Is Jehovah pleased with thousands of rams?
With myriads of streams of oil? Do I give my first-born \[for\] my
transgression? The fruit of my body \[for\] the sin of my soul?

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> He hath declared to thee, O man, what
\[is\] good; Yea, what is Jehovah requiring of thee, Except -- to do
judgment, and love kindness, And lowly to walk with thy God?

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> A voice of Jehovah to the city calleth, And
wisdom doth fear Thy name, Hear ye the rod, and Him who appointed it.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> Are there yet \[in\] the house of the
wicked Treasures of wickedness, And the abhorred scanty ephah?

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> Do I reckon \[it\] pure with balances of
wickedness? And with a bag of deceitful stones?

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> Whose rich ones have been full of
violence, And its inhabitants have spoken falsehood, And their tongue
\[is\] deceitful in their mouth.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> And I also, I have begun to smite thee,
To make desolate, because of thy sins.

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> Thou -- thou eatest, and thou art not
satisfied, And thy pit \[is\] in thy midst, And thou removest, and dost
not deliver, And that which thou deliverest, to a sword I give.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> Thou -- thou sowest, and thou dost not
reap, Thou -- thou treadest the olive, And thou pourest not out oil, And
new wine -- and thou drinkest not wine.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> And kept habitually are the statutes of
Omri, And all the work of the house of Ahab, And ye do walk in their
counsels, For My giving thee for a desolation, And its inhabitants for a
hissing, And the reproach of My people ye do bear!

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> My wo \[is\] to me, for I have been As
gatherings of summer-fruit, As gleanings of harvest, There is no cluster
to eat, The first-ripe fruit desired hath my soul.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> Perished hath the kind out of the land, And
upright among men -- there are none, All of them for blood lie in wait,
Each his brother they hunt \[with\] a net.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> On the evil \[are\] both hands to do \[it\]
well, The prince is asking -- also the judge -- for recompence, And the
great -- he is speaking the mischief of his soul, And they wrap it up.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> Their best one \[is\] as a brier, The
upright one -- than a thorn-hedge, The day of thy watchmen -- Thy
visitation -- hath come. Now is their perplexity.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> Believe not in a friend, trust not in a
leader, From her who is lying in thy bosom keep the openings of thy
mouth.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> For a son is dishonouring a father, A
daughter hath stood against her mother, A daughter-in-law against her
mother-in-law, The enemies of each \[are\] the men of his house.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> And I -- in Jehovah I do watch, I do wait
for the God of my salvation, Hear me doth my God.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> Thou dost not rejoice over me, O mine
enemy, When I have fallen, I have risen, When I sit in darkness Jehovah
is a light to me.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> The indignation of Jehovah I do bear, For I
have sinned against Him, Till that He doth plead my cause, And hath
executed my judgment, He doth bring me forth to the light, I look on His
righteousness.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> And see doth mine enemy, And cover her
doth shame, Who saith unto me, \`Where \[is\] Jehovah thy God?' Mine
eyes do look on her, Now she is for a treading-place, As mire of the
out-places.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> The day to build thy walls! That day --
removed is the limit.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> That day -- even unto thee it doth come
in, From Asshur and the cities of the fortress, And from the fortress
even unto the river, And from sea to sea, and mount to mount.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> And the land hath been for a desolation,
Because of its inhabitants, Because of the fruit of their doings.

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> Rule Thou Thy people with Thy rod, The
flock of Thine inheritance, Dwelling alone \[in\] a forest in the midst
of Carmel, They enjoy Bashan and Gilead as in days of old.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> According to the days of thy coming forth
out of the land of Egypt, I do shew it wonderful things.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> See do nations, and they are ashamed of
all their might, They lay a hand on the mouth, their ears are deaf.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> They lick dust as a serpent, as fearful
things of earth, They tremble from their enclosures, Of Jehovah our God
they are afraid, Yea, they are afraid of Thee.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> Who \[is\] a God like Thee? taking away
iniquity, And passing by the transgression of the remnant of His
inheritance, He hath not retained for ever His anger, Because He -- He
delighteth \[in\] kindness.

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> He doth turn back, He pitieth us, He doth
subdue our iniquities, And Thou castest into the depths of the sea all
their sins.

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> Thou givest truth to Jacob, kindness to
Abraham, That thou hast sworn to our fathers, from the days of
antiquity!
