<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ,  according to the faith of the choice ones of God, and an  acknowledging of truth that [is] according to piety,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;upon hope of life age-during, which God, who doth not lie,  did promise before times of ages,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;(and He manifested in proper times His word,) in preaching,  which I was entrusted with, according to a charge of God our  Saviour,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;to Titus -- true child according to a common faith: Grace,  kindness, peace, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ  our Saviour!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;For this cause left I thee in Crete, that the things lacking  thou mayest arrange, and mayest set down in every city elders,  as I did appoint to thee;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;if any one is blameless, of one wife a husband, having  children stedfast, not under accusation of riotous living or  insubordinate --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;for it behoveth the overseer to be blameless, as God's  steward, not self-pleased, nor irascible, not given to wine,  not a striker, not given to filthy lucre;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;but a lover of strangers, a lover of good men, sober-minded,  righteous, kind, self-controlled,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;holding -- according to the teaching -- to the stedfast  word, that he may be able also to exhort in the sound  teaching, and the gainsayers to convict;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;for there are many both insubordinate, vain-talkers, and  mind-deceivers -- especially they of the circumcision --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;whose mouth it behoveth to stop, who whole households do  overturn, teaching what things it behoveth not, for filthy  lucre's sake.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;A certain one of them, a prophet of their own, said --  `Cretans! always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;this testimony is true; for which cause convict them  sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;not giving heed to Jewish fables and commands of men,  turning themselves away from the truth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;all things, indeed, [are] pure to the pure, and to the  defiled and unstedfast [is] nothing pure, but of them defiled  [are] even the mind and the conscience;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;God they profess to know, and in the works they deny [Him],  being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work  disapproved.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;And thou -- be speaking what doth become the sound teaching;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;aged men to be temperate, grave, sober, sound in the faith,  in the love, in the endurance;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;aged women, in like manner, in deportment as doth become  sacred persons, not false accusers, to much wine not enslaved,  of good things teachers,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;that they may make the young women sober-minded, to be  lovers of [their] husbands, lovers of [their] children,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;sober, pure, keepers of [their own] houses, good, subject to  their own husbands, that the word of God may not be evil  spoken of.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;The younger men, in like manner, be exhorting to be  sober-minded;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;concerning all things thyself showing a pattern of good  works; in the teaching uncorruptedness, gravity,  incorruptibility,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;discourse sound, irreprehensible, that he who is of the  contrary part may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say  concerning you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;Servants -- to their own masters [are] to be subject, in all  things to be well-pleasing, not gainsaying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;not purloining, but showing all good stedfastness, that the  teaching of God our Saviour they may adorn in all things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;For the saving grace of God was manifested to all men,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;teaching us, that denying the impiety and the worldly  desires, soberly and righteously and piously we may live in  the present age,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;waiting for the blessed hope and manifestation of the glory  of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;who did give himself for us, that he might ransom us from  all lawlessness, and might purify to himself a peculiar  people, zealous of good works;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;these things be speaking, and exhorting, and convicting,  with all charge; let no one despise thee!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;Remind them to be subject to principalities and authorities,  to obey rule, unto every good work to be ready,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;of no one to speak evil, not to be quarrelsome -- gentle,  showing all meekness to all men,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;for we were once -- also we -- thoughtless, disobedient, led  astray, serving desires and pleasures manifold, in malice and  envy living, odious -- hating one another;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;and when the kindness and the love to men of God our Saviour  did appear</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;(not by works that [are] in righteousness that we did but  according to His kindness,) He did save us, through a bathing  of regeneration, and a renewing of the Holy Spirit,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;which He poured upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our  Saviour,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;that having been declared righteous by His grace, heirs we  may become according to the hope of life age-during.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;Stedfast [is] the word; and concerning these things I  counsel thee to affirm fully, that they may be thoughtful, to  be leading in good works -- who have believed God; these are  the good and profitable things to men,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;and foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and  strivings about law, stand away from -- for they are  unprofitable and vain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;A sectarian man, after a first and second admonition be  rejecting,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;having known that he hath been subverted who [is] such, and  doth sin, being self-condemned.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be  diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis, for there to winter I  have determined.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;Zenas the lawyer and Apollos bring diligently on their way,  that nothing to them may be lacking,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;and let them learn -- ours also -- to be leading in good  works to the necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;Salute thee do all those with me; salute those loving us in  faith; the grace [is] with you all!</p>
