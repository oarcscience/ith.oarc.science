<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;Words of Amos -- who hath been among herdsmen of Tekoa --  that he hath seen concerning Israel, in the days of Uzziah king  of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash king of  Israel, two years before the shaking;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;and he saith: Jehovah from Zion doth roar, And from  Jerusalem giveth forth His voice, And mourned have pastures of  the shepherds, And withered hath the top of Carmel!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;And thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Damascus,  And for four, I do not reverse it, Because of their threshing  Gilead with sharp-pointed irons,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;And I have sent a fire against the house of Hazael, And it  hath consumed the palaces of Ben-Hadad.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;And I have broken the bar of Damascus, And cut off the  inhabitant from Bikat-Aven, And a holder of a sceptre from  Beth-Eden, And removed have been the people of Aram to Kir,  said Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Gaza, And for  four, I do not reverse it, Because of their removing a complete  captivity, To deliver up to Edom,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;And I have sent a fire against the wall of Gaza, And it hath  consumed her palaces;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;And I have cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, And a holder  of a sceptre from Ashkelon, And have turned back My hand  against Ekron, And perished have the remnant of the  Philistines, Said the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Tyre, And for  four, I do not reverse it, Because of their delivering up a  complete captivity to Edom, And they remembered not the  brotherly covenant,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;And I have sent a fire against the wall of Tyre, And it  hath consumed her palaces.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Edom, And  for four, I do not reverse it, Because of his pursuing with a  sword his brother, And he hath destroyed his mercies, And tear  perpetually doth his anger, And his wrath -- he hath kept it  for ever,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;And I have sent a fire against Teman, And it hath consumed  palaces of Bozrah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of the sons of  Ammon, And for four, I do not reverse it, Because of their  ripping up the pregnant ones of Gilead, To enlarge their  border,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;And I have kindled a fire against the wall of Rabbah, And  it hath consumed her palaces, With a shout in a day of battle,  With a whirlwind in a day of hurricane,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;And gone hath their king in a removal, He and his heads  together, said Jehovah!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Moab, And for  four, I do not reverse it, Because of his burning the bones of  the king of Edom to lime,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;And I have sent a fire against Moab, And it hath consumed  the palaces of Kerioth, And dying with noise is Moab, With  shouting, with voice of a trumpet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;And I have cut off a judge from her midst, And all its heads  I slay with him, said Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Judah, And  for four, I do not reserve it, Because of their loathing the  law of Jehovah, And His statutes they have not kept, And their  lies do cause them to err, After which their fathers did walk,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;And I have sent a fire against Judah, And it hath consumed  palaces of Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Israel, And  for four, I do not reverse it, Because of their selling for  silver the righteous, And the needy for a pair of sandals.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;Who are panting for the dust of the earth on the head of the  poor, And the way of the humble they turn aside, And a man and  his father go unto the damsel, So as to pollute My holy name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;And on pledged garments they stretch themselves near every  altar, And the wine of fined ones they drink [in] the house of  their gods.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;And I -- I have destroyed the Amorite from before them,  Whose height [is] as the height of cedars, And strong he [is]  as the oaks, And I destroy his fruit from above, And his roots  from beneath.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;And I -- I have brought you up from the land of Egypt, And  cause you to go in a wilderness forty years, To possess the  land of the Amorite.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;And I raise of your sons for prophets, And of your choice  ones for Nazarites, Is not this true, O sons of Israel? An  affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;And ye cause the Nazarites to drink wine, And on the  prophets ye have laid a charge, Saying, `Do not prophecy!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;Lo, I am pressing you under, As the full cart doth press  for itself a sheaf.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;And perished hath refuge from the swift, And the strong  strengtheneth not his power, And the mighty delivereth not his  soul.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;And the handler of the bow standeth not, And the swift with  his feet delivereth not [himself], And the rider of the horse  delivereth not his soul.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;And the courageous of heart among the mighty, Naked doth  flee in that day, An affirmation of Jehovah!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;Hear ye this word that Jehovah hath spoken concerning you, O  sons of Israel, concerning all the family that I brought up  from the land of Egypt, saying:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;Only you I have known of all families of the land, Therefore  I charge on you all your iniquities.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;Do two walk together if they have not met?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;Roar doth a lion in a forest and prey he hath none? Give out  doth a young lion his voice from his habitation, If he hath not  caught?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;Doth a bird fall into a snare of the earth, And there is no  gin for it? Doth a snare go up from the ground, And prey it  captureth not?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;Is a trumpet blown in a city, And do people not tremble? Is  there affliction in a city, And Jehovah hath not done [it]?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;For the Lord Jehovah doth nothing, Except He hath revealed  His counsel unto His servants the prophets.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;A lion hath roared -- who doth not fear? The Lord Jehovah  hath spoken -- who doth not prophesy?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;Sound ye unto palaces in Ashdod, And to palaces in the land  of Egypt, and say: Be ye gathered on mountains of Samaria, And  see many troubles within her, And oppressed ones in her midst.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;And they have not known to act straightforwardly, An  affirmation of Jehovah, Who are treasuring up violence and  spoil in their palaces.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: An adversary -- and  surrounding the land, And he hath brought down from thee thy  strength, And spoiled have been thy palaces.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: As the shepherd delivereth from the  lion's mouth Two legs, or a piece of an ear, So delivered are  the sons of Israel, Who are sitting in Samaria on the corner of  a bed, And in Damascus [on that of] a couch.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;Hear ye and testify to the house of Jacob, An affirmation  of the Lord Jehovah, God of Hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;For in the day of My charging the transgressions of Israel  on him, I have laid a charge on the altars of Beth-El, And cut  off have been the horns of the altar, And they have fallen to  the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;And I have smitten the winter-house with the summer-house,  And perished have houses of ivory, And consumed have been many  houses, An affirmation of Jehovah!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, Who [are] in the mountain  of Samaria, Who are oppressing the poor, Who are bruising the  needy, Who are saying to their lords: `Bring in, and we do  drink.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;Sworn hath the Lord Jehovah by His holiness, That lo, days  are coming upon you, And he hath taken you away with hooks, And  your posterity with fish-hooks.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;And [by] breaches ye go forth, A woman [at that]  over-against her, And ye have cast down the high place, An  affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;Enter ye Beth-El, and transgress, At Gilgal multiply  transgression, And bring in every morning your sacrifices,  Every third year your tithes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;And perfume with leaven a thank-offering, And proclaim  willing gifts, sound ye! For so ye have loved, O sons of  Israel, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;And I also -- I have given to you cleanness of teeth in all  your cities, And lack of bread in all your places, And ye have  not turned back unto Me, an affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;And I also -- I have withheld from you the rain. While yet  three months to harvest, And I have sent rain on one city, And  on another city I do not send rain, One portion is rained on,  And the portion on which it raineth not withereth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;And wandered have two or three cities, Unto the same city to  drink water, And they are not satisfied, And ye have not turned  back unto Me, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;I have smitten you with blasting and with mildew, The  abundance of your gardens and of your vineyards, And of your  figs, and of your olives, Eat doth the palmer-worm, And ye have  not turned back unto Me, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;I have sent among you pestilence by the way of Egypt, I  have slain by sword your choice ones, With your captive horses,  And I cause the stink of your camps to come up -- even into  your nostrils, And ye have not turned back unto Me, An  affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;I have overturned among you, Like the overturn by God of  Sodom and Gomorrah, And ye are as a brand delivered from a  burning, And ye have not turned back unto Me, An affirmation of  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus I do to thee, O Israel, at last, Because  this I do to thee, Prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;For, lo, the former of mountains, and creator of wind, And  the declarer to man what [is] His thought, He is making dawn  obscurity, And is treading on high places of earth, Jehovah,  God of Hosts, [is] His name!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;Hear this word that I am bearing to you, A lamentation, O  house of Israel:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;`Fallen, not again to rise, hath the virgin of Israel, Left  on her land -- she hath no raiser up.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;For thus said the Lord Jehovah: The city that is going out a  thousand, Doth leave an hundred, And that which is going out an  hundred, Doth leave ten to the house of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;For thus said Jehovah to the house of Israel: Seek ye Me,  and live,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;And seek not Beth-El, and Gilgal enter not, And Beer-Sheba  pass not through, For Gilgal doth utterly remove, And Beth-El  doth become vanity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;Seek ye Jehovah, and live, Lest He prosper as fire [against]  the house of Joseph, And it hath consumed, And there is no  quencher for Beth-El.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;Ye who are turning to wormwood judgment, And righteousness  to the earth have put down,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;The maker of Kimah and Kesil, And the turner to morning of  death-shade, And day [as] night He hath made dark, Who is  calling to the waters of the sea, And poureth them on the face  of the earth, Jehovah [is] His name;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;Who is brightening up the spoiled against the strong, And  the spoiled against a fortress cometh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;They have hated a reprover in the gate, And a plain speaker  they abominate.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;Therefore, because of your trampling on the poor, And the  tribute of corn ye take from him, Houses of hewn work ye have  built, And ye do not dwell in them, Desirable vineyards ye  have planted, And ye do not drink their wine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;For I have known -- many [are] your transgressions, And  mighty your sins, Adversaries of the righteous, taking ransoms,  And the needy in the gate ye turned aside.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;Therefore is the wise at that time silent, For an evil  time it [is].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live, And it is so;  Jehovah, God of Hosts, [is] with you, as ye said.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;Hate evil, and love good, And set up judgment in the gate,  It may be Jehovah, God of Hosts, doth pity the remnant of  Joseph.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said Jehovah, God of Hosts, the Lord, In  all broad places [is] lamentation, And in all out-places they  say, `Alas, alas,' And called the husbandman to mourning, And  to lamentation the skilful of wailing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;And in all vineyards [is] lamentation, For I pass into thy  midst, said Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;Ho, ye who are desiring the day of Jehovah, Why [is] this  to you -- the day of Jehovah? It is darkness, and not light,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;As [when] one fleeth from the face of the lion, And the  bear hath met him, And he hath come in to the house, And hath  leant his hand on the wall, And the serpent hath bitten him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:20">5:20</A>&nbsp;Is not the day of Jehovah darkness and not light, Even  thick darkness that hath no brightness?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:21">5:21</A>&nbsp;I have hated -- I have loathed your festivals, And I am not  refreshed by your restraints.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:22">5:22</A>&nbsp;For though ye cause burnt-offerings and your presents to  ascend to Me, I am not pleased, And the peace-offering of your  fatlings I behold not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:23">5:23</A>&nbsp;Turn aside from Me the noise of thy songs, Yea, the praise  of thy psaltery I hear not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:24">5:24</A>&nbsp;And roll on as waters doth judgment, And righteousness as a  perennial stream.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:25">5:25</A>&nbsp;Sacrifices and offering did ye bring nigh to Me, In a  wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:26">5:26</A>&nbsp;And ye bare Succoth your king, and Chiun your images, The  star of your god, that ye made for yourselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:27">5:27</A>&nbsp;And I removed you beyond Damascus, Said Jehovah, God of  Hosts [is] His name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;Wo [to] those secure in Zion, And those confident in the  mount of Samaria, The marked of the chief of the nations, And  come to them have the house of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;Pass ye over [to] Calneh and see, And go thence [to] Hamath  the great, And go down [to] Gath of the Philistines, Are [they]  better than these kingdoms? Greater [is] their border than your  border?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;Who are putting away the day of evil, And ye bring nigh the  seat of violence,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;Who are lying down on beds of ivory, And are spread out on  their couches, And are eating lambs from the flock, And calves  from the midst of the stall,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;Who are taking part according to the psaltery, Like David  they invented for themselves instruments of music;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;Who are drinking with bowls of wine, And [with] chief  perfumes anoint [themselves], And have not been pained for the  breach of Joseph.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;Therefore now they remove at the head of the captives, And  turned aside is the mourning-feast of stretched-out ones.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;Sworn hath the Lord Jehovah by Himself, An affirmation of  Jehovah, God of Hosts: I am abominating the excellency of  Jacob, And his high places I have hated, And I have delivered  up the city and its fulness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;And if there are left ten persons in one house, It hath come  to pass -- that they have died.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;And lifted him up hath his loved one, even his burner, To  bring forth the bones from the house, And he said to him who  [is] in the sides of the house, `Is there yet with thee?' And  he said, `None,' then he said, `Hush! Save to make mention of  the name of Jehovah.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;For lo, Jehovah is commanding, And He hath smitten the  great house [with] breaches, And the little house [with]  clefts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;Do horses run on a rock? Doth one plough [it] with oxen?  For ye have turned to gall judgment, And the fruit of  righteousness to wormwood.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;O ye who are rejoicing at nothing, Who are saying, `Have we  not by our strength taken to ourselves horns?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;Surely, lo, I am raising against you a nation, O house of  Israel, An affirmation of Jehovah, God of Hosts, And they have  oppressed you from the coming in to Hamath, Unto the stream of  the desert.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;Thus hath the Lord Jehovah shewed me, and lo, He is forming  locusts at the beginning of the ascending of the latter growth,  and lo, the latter growth [is] after the mowings of the king;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;and it hath come to pass, when it hath finished to consume  the herb of the land, that I say: `Lord Jehovah, forgive, I  pray Thee, How doth Jacob arise -- for he [is] small?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;Jehovah hath repented of this, `It shall not be,' said  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;Thus hath the Lord Jehovah shewed me, and lo, the Lord  Jehovah is calling to contend by fire, and it consumeth the  great deep, yea, it hath consumed the portion, and I say:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;`Lord Jehovah, cease, I pray Thee, How doth Jacob arise --  for he [is] small?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;Jehovah hath repented of this, `It also shall not be,' said  the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;Thus hath He shewed me, and lo, the Lord is standing by a  wall [made according to] a plumb-line, and in His hand a  plumb-line;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;and Jehovah saith unto me, `What art thou seeing, Amos?' And  I say, `A plumb-line;' and the Lord saith: `Lo, I am setting a  plumb-line in the midst of My people Israel, I do not add any  more to pass over to it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;And desolated have been high places of Isaac, And  sanctuaries of Israel are wasted, And I have risen against the  house of Jeroboam with a sword.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;And Amaziah priest of Beth-El sendeth unto Jeroboam king of  Israel, saying, `Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst  of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his  words,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;for thus said Amos: By sword die doth Jeroboam, And Israel  certainly removeth from off its land.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;And Amaziah saith unto Amos, `Seer, go flee for thee unto  the land of Judah, and eat there bread, and there thou dost  prophesy;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;and [at] Beth-El do not add to prophesy any more, for it  [is] the king's sanctuary, and it [is] the royal house.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;And Amos answereth and saith unto Amaziah, `I [am] no  prophet, nor a prophet's son [am] I, but a herdsman I [am], and  a cultivator of sycamores,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;and Jehovah taketh me from after the flock, and Jehovah  saith unto me, Go, prophesy unto My people Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;And now, hear a word of Jehovah: thou art saying, Do not  prophesy against Israel, nor drop [any thing] against the house  of Isaac,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;therefore thus said Jehovah: Thy wife in the city doth go  a-whoring, And thy sons and thy daughters by sword do fall, And  thy land by line is apportioned, And thou on an unclean land  diest, And Israel certainly removeth from off its land.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;Thus hath the Lord Jehovah shewed me, and, lo, a basket of  summer-fruit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;And He saith, `What art thou seeing, Amos?' and I say, `A  basket of summer-fruit.' And Jehovah saith unto me: `The end  hath come unto My people Israel, I do not add any more to pass  over to it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;And howled have songstresses of a palace in that day, An  affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, Many [are] the carcases, into  any place throw -- hush!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;Hear this, ye who are swallowing up the needy, To cause to  cease the poor of the land,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;Saying, When doth the new moon pass, And we sell ground  corn? And the sabbath, and we open out pure corn? To make  little the ephah, And to make great the shekel, And to use  perversely balances of deceit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;To purchase with money the poor, And the needy for a pair of  sandals, Yea, the refuse of the pure corn we sell.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;Sworn hath Jehovah by the excellency of Jacob: `I forget not  for ever any of their works.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;For this doth not the land tremble, And mourned hath every  dweller in it? And come up as a flood hath all of it. And it  hath been cast out, and hath sunk, Like the flood of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass in that day, An affirmation of the  Lord Jehovah, I have caused the sun to go in at noon, And  caused darkness on the land in a day of light,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;And have turned your festivals to mourning, And all your  songs to lamentation, And caused sackcloth to come up on all  loins, And on every head -- baldness, And made it as a mourning  [of] an only one, And its latter end as a day of bitterness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;Lo, days are coming, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah,  And I have sent a famine into the land, Not a famine of bread,  nor a thirst of water But of hearing the words of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;And they have wandered from sea unto sea, And from north  even unto east, They go to and fro to seek the word of Jehovah,  And they do not find.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;In that day faint do the fair virgins, And the young men,  with thirst.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;Those swearing by the guilt of Samaria, And have said, Live  doth thy god, O Dan, And, Live doth the way of Beer-Sheba, And  they have fallen -- and rise not again!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;I have seen the Lord standing by the altar, and He saith:  `Smite the knob, and the thresholds shake, And cut them off by  the head -- all of them, And their posterity with a sword I do  slay, Not flee to them doth the fleer, Nor escape to them doth  a fugitive.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;If they dig through into sheol, From thence doth My hand  take them, And if they go up the heavens, From thence I cause  them to come down.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;And if they be hid in the top of Carmel, From thence I  search out, and have taken them, And if they be hid from Mine  eyes in the bottom of the sea, From thence I command the  serpent, And it hath bitten them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;And if they go into captivity before their enemies, From  thence I command the sword, And it hath slain them, And I have  set Mine eye on them for evil, And not for good.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;And [it is] the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, Who is striking  against the land, and it melteth, And mourned have all the  inhabitants in it, And come up as a flood hath all of it, And  it hath sunk -- like the flood of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;Who is building in the heavens His upper chambers; As to His  troop, Upon earth He hath founded it, Who is calling for the  waters of the sea, And poureth them out on the face of the  land, Jehovah [is] His name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;As sons of Cushim are ye not to Me? O sons of Israel -- an  affirmation of Jehovah. Israel did I not bring up out of the  land of Egypt? And the Philistines from Caphtor, and Aram from  Kir?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;Lo, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah [are] on the sinful  kingdom, And I have destroyed it from off the face of the  ground, Only, I destroy not utterly the house of Jacob, An  affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;For lo, I am commanding, And I have shaken among all the  nations the house of Israel, As [one] doth shake with a sieve,  And there falleth not a grain [to] the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;By sword die do all sinners of My people, Who are saying,  `Not overtake, or go before, For our sakes, doth evil.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;In that day I raise the tabernacle of David, that is  fallen, And I have repaired their breaches, And its ruins I do  raise up, And I have built it up as in days of old.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;So that they possess the remnant of Edom, And all the  nations on whom My name is called, An affirmation of Jehovah --  doer of this.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;Lo, days are coming -- an affirmation of Jehovah, And come  nigh hath the ploughman to the reaper, And the treader of  grapes to the scatterer of seed, And the mountains have dropt  juice, And all the hills do melt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;And I have turned back [to] the captivity of My people  Israel, And they have built desolate cities, and inhabited, And  have planted vineyards, and drunk their wine, And made gardens,  and eaten their fruit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;And I have planted them on their own ground, And they are  not plucked up any more from off their own ground, That I have  given to them, said Jehovah thy God! </p>
