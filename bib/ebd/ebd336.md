<span id="000">**Sheriffs**</span> ([Dan 3:2](../kjv/dan003.htm#002).md),
Babylonian officers.

<span id="001">**Sheshach**</span> ([Jer 25:26](../kjv/jer025.htm#026).md),
supposed to be equivalent to Babel (Babylon), according to a secret
(cabalistic) mode of writing among the Jews of unknown antiquity, which
consisted in substituting the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet for the
first, the last but one for the second, and so on. Thus the letters sh,
sh, ch become b, b, l i.e., Babel. This is supposed to be confirmed by a
reference to [Jer 51:41](../kjv/jer051.htm#041.md), where Sheshach and
Babylon are in parallel clauses. There seems to be no reason to doubt
that Babylon is here intended by this name. (See Streane's Jeremiah,
l.c.)

<span id="002">**Sheshai**</span> Whitish, one of the sons of Anak ([Num
13:22](../kjv/num013.htm#022).md). When the Israelites obtained possession
of the country the sons of Anak were expelled and slain ([Jos
15:14](../kjv/jos015.htm#014); [Jdg 1:10](../kjv/jdg001.htm#010).md).

<span id="003">**Sheshbazzar**</span> O sun-god, defend the lord! ([Ezr
1:8](../kjv/ezr001.htm#008), [Ezr 1:11](../kjv/ezr001.htm#011).md),
probably another name for Zerubbabel (q.v.), [Ezr
2:2](../kjv/ezr002.htm#002); [Hag 1:12](../kjv/hag001.htm#012.md), [Hag
1:14](../kjv/hag001.htm#014); [Zac 4:6](../kjv/zac004.htm#006.md), [Zac
4:10](../kjv/zac004.htm#010.md).

<span id="004">**Sheth**</span> Tumult. (1.) "The children of Sheth"
([Num 24:17](../kjv/num024.htm#017).md); R.V., "the sons of tumult," which
is probably the correct rendering, as there is no evidence that this is
a proper name here. (2.) The antediluvian patriarch ([Ch1
1:1](../kjv/ch1001.htm#001).md).

<span id="005">**Shethar**</span> A star, a prince at the court of
Ahasuerus ([Est 1:14](../kjv/est001.htm#014).md).

<span id="006">**Shethar-boznai**</span> Star of splendour, a Persian
officer who vainly attempted to hinder the rebuilding of the temple
([Ezr 5:3](../kjv/ezr005.htm#003), [Ezr 5:6](../kjv/ezr005.htm#006.md);
[Ezr 6:6](../kjv/ezr006.htm#006), [Ezr 6:13](../kjv/ezr006.htm#013).md).

<span id="007">**Sheva**</span> Heb. Shebher . (1.) The son of Caleb
([Ch1 2:49](../kjv/ch1002.htm#049)). (2..md) Heb. Sheva' , one of David's
scribes ([Sa2 20:25](../kjv/sa2020.htm#025).md).

<span id="008">**Shewbread**</span> [Exo 25:30](../kjv/exo025.htm#030.md)
(R.V. marg., "presence bread"); [Ch1 9:32](../kjv/ch1009.htm#032.md)
(marg., "bread of ordering"); [Num 4:7](../kjv/num004.htm#007.md) : called
"hallowed bread" (R.V., "holy bread") in [Sa1
21:1](../kjv/sa1021.htm#001.md). This bread consisted of twelve loaves made
of the finest flour. They were flat and thin, and were placed in two
rows of six each on a table in the holy place before the Lord. They were
renewed every Sabbath ([Lev 24:5](../kjv/lev024.htm#005).md), and those
that were removed to give place to the new ones were to be eaten by the
priests only in the holy place (see [Sa1 21:3](../kjv/sa1021.htm#003.md);
compare [Mat 12:3](../kjv/mat012.htm#003.md), [Mat
12:4](../kjv/mat012.htm#004).md). The number of the loaves represented the
twelve tribes of Israel, and also the entire spiritual Israel, "the true
Israel;" and the placing of them on the table symbolized the entire
consecration of Israel to the Lord, and their acceptance of God as their
God. The table for the bread was made of acacia wood, 3 feet long, 18
inches broad, and 2 feet 3 inches high. It was plated with pure gold.
Two staves, plated with gold, passed through golden rings, were used for
carrying it.

<span id="009">**Shibboleth**</span> River, or an ear of corn. The
tribes living on the east of Jordan, separated from their brethren on
the west by the deep ravines and the rapid river, gradually came to
adopt peculiar customs, and from mixing largely with the Moabites,
Ishmaelites, and Ammonites to pronounce certain letters in such a manner
as to distinguish them from the other tribes. Thus when the Ephraimites
from the west invaded Gilead, and were defeated by the Gileadites under
the leadership of Jephthah, and tried to escape by the "passages of the
Jordan," the Gileadites seized the fords and would allow none to pass
who could not pronounce "shibboleth" with a strong aspirate. This the
fugitives were unable to do. They said "sibboleth," as the word was
pronounced by the tribes on the west, and thus they were detected ([Jdg
12:1](../kjv/jdg012.htm#001).md). Forty-two thousand were thus detected,
and "Without reprieve, adjudged to death, For want of well-pronouncing
shibboleth."
