------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="000">**Covetousness**</span> A strong desire after the
possession of worldly things ([Col 3:5](../kjv/col003.htm#005.md); [Eph
5:5](../kjv/eph005.htm#005); [Heb 13:5](../kjv/heb013.htm#005.md); [Ti1
6:9](../kjv/ti1006.htm#009), [Ti1 6:10](../kjv/ti1006.htm#010.md); [Mat
6:20](../kjv/mat006.htm#020).md). It assumes sometimes the more aggravated
form of avarice, which is the mark of cold-hearted worldliness.

<span id="001">**Cow**</span> A cow and her calf were not to be killed
on the same day ([Lev 22:28](../kjv/lev022.htm#028.md); [Exo
23:19](../kjv/exo023.htm#019); [Deu 22:6](../kjv/deu022.htm#006.md), [Deu
22:7](../kjv/deu022.htm#007).md). The reason for this enactment is not
given. A state of great poverty is described in the words of [Isa
7:21](../kjv/isa007.htm#021.md), where, instead of possessing great
resources, a man shall depend for the subsistence of himself and his
family on what a single cow and two sheep could yield.

<span id="002">**Crane**</span> ([Isa 38:14](../kjv/isa038.htm#014.md);
[Jer 8:7](../kjv/jer008.htm#007).md). In both of these passages the
Authorized Version has reversed the Hebrew order of the words. "Crane or
swallow" should be "swallow or crane," as in the Revised Version. The
rendering is there correct. The Hebrew for crane is the Grus cincerea, a
bird well known in Palestine. It is migratory, and is distinguished by
its loud voice, its cry being hoarse and melancholy.

<span id="003">**Creation**</span> "In the beginning" God created, i.e.,
called into being, all things out of nothing. This creative act on the
part of God was absolutely free, and for infinitely wise reasons. The
cause of all things exists only in the will of God. The work of creation
is attributed (1.) to the Godhead ([Gen 1:1](../kjv/gen001.htm#001.md),
[Gen 1:26](../kjv/gen001.htm#026)); (2..md) to the Father ([Co1
8:6](../kjv/co1008.htm#006)); (3..md) to the Son ([Joh
1:3](../kjv/joh001.htm#003); [Col 1:16](../kjv/col001.htm#016.md), [Col
1:17](../kjv/col001.htm#017)); (4..md) to the Holy Spirit ([Gen
1:2](../kjv/gen001.htm#002); [Job 26:13](../kjv/job026.htm#013.md); [Psa
104:30](../kjv/psa104.htm#030).md). The fact that he is the Creator
distinguishes Jehovah as the true God ([Isa
37:16](../kjv/isa037.htm#016); [Isa 40:12](../kjv/isa040.htm#012.md), [Isa
40:13](../kjv/isa040.htm#013); [Isa 54:5](../kjv/isa054.htm#005.md); [Psa
96:5](../kjv/psa096.htm#005); [Jer 10:11](../kjv/jer010.htm#011.md), [Jer
10:12](../kjv/jer010.htm#012).md). The one great end in the work of
creation is the manifestation of the glory of the Creator ([Col
1:16](../kjv/col001.htm#016); [Rev 4:11](../kjv/rev004.htm#011.md); [Rom
11:36](../kjv/rom011.htm#036).md). God's works, equally with God's word,
are a revelation from him; and between the teachings of the one and
those of the other, when rightly understood, there can be no
contradiction. Traditions of the creation, disfigured by corruptions,
are found among the records of ancient Eastern nations. (See ACCAD.) A
peculiar interest belongs to the traditions of the Accadians, the
primitive inhabitants of the plains of Lower Mesopotamia. These within
the last few years have been brought to light in the tablets and
cylinders which have been rescued from the long-buried palaces and
temples of Assyria. They bear a remarkable resemblance to the record of
Genesis.

<span id="004">**Creature**</span> Denotes the whole creation in [Rom
8:39](../kjv/rom008.htm#039); [Col 1:15](../kjv/col001.htm#015.md); [Rev
5:13](../kjv/rev005.htm#013.md); the whole human race in [Mar
16:15](../kjv/mar016.htm#015); [Rom 8:19](../kjv/rom008.htm#019.md). The
living creatures in [Eze 10:15](../kjv/eze010.htm#015.md), [Eze
10:17](../kjv/eze010.htm#017.md), are imaginary beings, symbols of the
Divine attributes and operations.

<span id="005">**Crescens**</span> Increasing, probably one of the
seventy disciples of Christ. He was one of Paul's assistants ([Ti2
4:10](../kjv/ti2004.htm#010).md), probably a Christian of Rome.

<span id="006">**Crete**</span> Now called Candia, one of the largest
islands in the Meditterranean, about 140 miles long and 35 broad. It was
at one time a very prosperous and populous island, having a "hundred
cities." The character of the people is described in Paul's quotation
from "one of their own poets" (Epimenides) in his epistle to Titus: "The
Cretans are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies" ([Tit
1:12](../kjv/tit001.htm#012).md). Jews from Crete were in Jerusalem on the
day of Pentecost ([Act 2:11](../kjv/act002.htm#011).md). The island was
visited by Paul on his voyage to Rome (Acts 27). Here Paul subsequently
left Titus ([Tit 1:5](../kjv/tit001.htm#005).md) "to ordain elders." Some
have supposed that it was the original home of the Caphtorim (q.v.) or
Philistines.

<span id="007">**Crimson**</span> See COLOUR.

<span id="008">**Crisping-pin**</span> ([Isa
3:22](../kjv/isa003.htm#022); R.V., "satchel".md), some kind of female
ornament, probably like the modern reticule. The Hebrew word harit
properly signifies pouch or casket or purse. It is rendered "bag" in
[Kg2 5:23](../kjv/kg2005.htm#023.md).

<span id="009">**Crispus**</span> Curled, the chief of the synagogue at
Corinth ([Act 18:8](../kjv/act018.htm#008).md). He was converted and, with
his family, baptized by Paul ([Co1 1:14](../kjv/co1001.htm#014).md).
