<span id="000">**Goodness**</span> In man is not a mere passive quality,
but the deliberate preference of right to wrong, the firm and persistent
resistance of all moral evil, and the choosing and following of all
moral good.

<span id="001">**Gopher**</span> A tree from the wood of which Noah was
directed to build the ark ([Gen 6:14](../kjv/gen006.htm#014).md). It is
mentioned only there. The LXX. render this word by "squared beams," and
the Vulgate by "planed wood." Other versions have rendered it "pine" and
"cedar;" but the weight of authority is in favour of understanding by it
the cypress tree, which grows abundantly in Chaldea and Armenia.

<span id="002">**Goshen**</span> (1.) A district in Egypt where Jacob
and his family settled, and in which they remained till the Exodus ([Gen
45:10](../kjv/gen045.htm#010); [Gen 46:28](../kjv/gen046.htm#028.md), [Gen
46:29](../kjv/gen046.htm#029), [Gen 46:31](../kjv/gen046.htm#031.md),
etc.). It is called "the land of Goshen" ([Gen
47:27](../kjv/gen047.htm#027).md), and also simply "Goshen" ([Gen
46:28](../kjv/gen046.htm#028).md), and "the land of Rameses" ([Gen
47:11](../kjv/gen047.htm#011); [Exo 12:37](../kjv/exo012.htm#037).md), for
the towns Pithom and Rameses lay within its borders; also Zoan or Tanis
([Psa 78:12](../kjv/psa078.htm#012).md). It lay on the east of the Nile,
and apparently not far from the royal residence. It was "the best of the
land" ([Gen 47:6](../kjv/gen047.htm#006.md), [Gen
47:11](../kjv/gen047.htm#011).md), but is now a desert. It is first
mentioned in Joseph's message to his father. It has been identified with
the modern Wady Tumilat, lying between the eastern part of the Delta and
the west border of Palestine. It was a pastoral district, where some of
the king's cattle were kept ([Gen 47:6](../kjv/gen047.htm#006).md). The
inhabitants were not exclusively Israelites ([Exo
3:22](../kjv/exo003.htm#022); [Exo 11:2](../kjv/exo011.htm#002.md); [Exo
12:35](../kjv/exo012.htm#035), [Exo 12:36](../kjv/exo012.htm#036)). (2..md)
A district in Palestine ([Jos 10:41](../kjv/jos010.htm#041.md); [Jos
11:16](../kjv/jos011.htm#016).md). It was a part of the maritime plain of
Judah, and lay between Gaza and Gibeon. (3.) A town in the mountains of
Judah ([Jos 15:51](../kjv/jos015.htm#051).md).

<span id="003">**Gospel**</span> A word of Anglo-Saxon origin, and
meaning "God's spell", i.e., word of God, or rather, according to
others, "good spell", i.e., good news. It is the rendering of the Greek
evangelion , i.e., "good message." It denotes (1.) "the welcome
intelligence of salvation to man as preached by our Lord and his
followers. (2.) It was afterwards transitively applied to each of the
four histories of our Lord's life, published by those who are therefore
called 'Evangelists', writers of the history of the gospel (the
evangelion). (3.) The term is often used to express collectively the
gospel doctrines; and 'preaching the gospel' is often used to include
not only the proclaiming of the good tidings, but the teaching men how
to avail themselves of the offer of salvation, the declaring of all the
truths, precepts, promises, and threatenings of Christianity." It is
termed "the gospel of the grace of God" ([Act
20:24](../kjv/act020.htm#024).md), "the gospel of the kingdom" ([Mat
4:23](../kjv/mat004.htm#023).md), "the gospel of Christ" ([Rom
1:16](../kjv/rom001.htm#016).md), "the gospel of peace ([Eph
6:15](../kjv/eph006.htm#015).md), "the glorious gospel," "the everlasting
gospel," "the gospel of salvation" ([Eph 1:13](../kjv/eph001.htm#013).md).

<span id="004">**Gospels**</span> The central fact of Christian
preaching was the intelligence that the Saviour had come into the world
([Mat 4:23](../kjv/mat004.htm#023); [Rom 10:15](../kjv/rom010.htm#015).md);
and the first Christian preachers who called their account of the person
and mission of Christ by the term evangelion (= good message) were
called evangelistai (= evangelists) ([Eph 4:11](../kjv/eph004.htm#011.md);
[Act 21:8](../kjv/act021.htm#008).md). There are four historical accounts
of the person and work of Christ: "the first by Matthew, announcing the
Redeemer as the promised King of the kingdom of God; the second by Mark,
declaring him 'a prophet, mighty in deed and word;' the third by Luke,
of whom it might be said that the represents Christ in the special
character of the Saviour of sinners ([Luk 7:36](../kjv/luk007.htm#036.md);
[Luk 15:18](../kjv/luk015.htm#018).md); the fourth by John, who represents
Christ as the Son of God, in whom deity and humanity become one. The
ancient Church gave to Matthew the symbol of the lion, to Mark that of a
man, to Luke that of the ox, and to John that of the eagle: these were
the four faces of the cherubim" ([Eze 1:10](../kjv/eze001.htm#010).md).
Date. The Gospels were all composed during the latter part of the first
century, and there is distinct historical evidence to show that they
were used and accepted as authentic before the end of the second
century. Mutual relation. "If the extent of all the coincidences be
represented by 100, their proportionate distribution will be: Matthew,
Mark, and Luke, 53; Matthew and Luke, 21; Matthew and Mark, 20; Mark and
Luke, 6. Looking only at the general result, it may be said that of the
contents of the synoptic Gospels \[i.e., the first three Gospels\] about
two-fifths are common to the three, and that the parts peculiar to one
or other of them are little more than one-third of the whole." Origin.
Did the evangelists copy from one another? The opinion is well founded
that the Gospels were published by the apostles orally before they were
committed to writing, and that each had an independent origin. (See
MATTHEW, GOSPEL OF.)

<span id="005">**Gourd**</span> (1.) Jonah's gourd ([Jon
4:6](../kjv/jon004.htm#006).md), bearing the Hebrew name kikayon (found
only here), was probably the kiki of the Egyptians, the croton. This is
the castor-oil plant, a species of ricinus, the palma Christi, so called
from the palmate division of its leaves. Others with more probability
regard it as the cucurbita the el-keroa of the Arabs, a kind of pumpkin
peculiar to the East. "It is grown in great abundance on the alluvial
banks of the Tigris and on the plain between the river and the ruins of
Nineveh." At the present day it is trained to run over structures of mud
and brush to form boots to protect the gardeners from the heat of the
noon-day sun. It grows with extraordinary rapidity, and when cut or
injured withers away also with great rapidity. (2.) Wild gourds ([Kg2
4:38](../kjv/kg2004.htm#038).md), Heb. pakkuoth , belong to the family of
the cucumber-like plants, some of which are poisonous. The species here
referred to is probably the colocynth (Cucumis colocynthus). Thus). The
LXX. render the word by "wild pumpkin." It abounds in the desert parts
of Syria, Egypt, and Arabia. There is, however, another species, called
the Cucumis prophetarum, from the idea that it afforded the gourd which
"the sons of the prophets" shred by mistake into their pottage.

<span id="006">**Government of God**</span> See PROVIDENCE.

<span id="007">**Governments**</span> ([Co1
12:28](../kjv/co1012.htm#028).md), the powers which fit a man for a place
of influence in the church; "the steersman's art; the art of guiding
aright the vessel of church or state."

<span id="008">**Governor**</span> (1.) Heb. nagid , a prominent,
conspicuous person, whatever his capacity: as, chief of the royal palace
([Ch2 28:7](../kjv/ch2028.htm#007.md); compare [Kg1
4:6](../kjv/kg1004.htm#006).md), chief of the temple ([Ch1
9:11](../kjv/ch1009.htm#011); [Jer 20:1](../kjv/jer020.htm#001).md), the
leader of the Aaronites ([Ch1 12:27](../kjv/ch1012.htm#027).md), keeper of
the sacred treasury ([Ch1 26:24](../kjv/ch1026.htm#024).md), captain of the
army ([Ch1 13:1](../kjv/ch1013.htm#001).md), the king ([Sa1
9:16](../kjv/sa1009.htm#016).md), the Messiah ([Dan
9:25](../kjv/dan009.htm#025)). (2..md) Heb. nasi , raised; exalted. Used to
denote the chiefs of families ([Num 3:24](../kjv/num003.htm#024.md), [Num

3:35](../kjv/num003.htm#035).md); also of tribes ([Num
2:3](../kjv/num002.htm#003); [Num 7:2](../kjv/num007.htm#002.md); [Num
3:32](../kjv/num003.htm#032).md). These dignities appear to have been
elective, not hereditary. (3.) Heb. pakid , an officer or magistrate. It
is used of the delegate of the high priest ([Ch2
24:11](../kjv/ch2024.htm#011).md), the Levites ([Neh
11:22](../kjv/neh011.htm#022).md), a military commander ([Kg2
25:19](../kjv/kg2025.htm#019).md), Joseph's officers in Egypt ([Gen
41:34](../kjv/gen041.htm#034)). (4..md) Heb. shallit , one who has power,
who rules ([Gen 42:6](../kjv/gen042.htm#006.md); [Ezr
4:20](../kjv/ezr004.htm#020); [Ecc 8:8](../kjv/ecc008.htm#008.md); [Dan

one who rules, holds dominion. Used of many classes of rulers ([Gen
3:16](../kjv/gen003.htm#016); [Gen 24:2](../kjv/gen024.htm#002.md); [Gen
45:8](../kjv/gen045.htm#008); [Psa 105:20](../kjv/psa105.htm#020).md); of
the Messiah ([Mic 5:2](../kjv/mic005.htm#002).md); of God ([Ch1
29:12](../kjv/ch1029.htm#012); [Psa 103:19](../kjv/psa103.htm#019).md).
(7.) Heb. sar , a ruler or chief; a word of very general use. It is used
of the chief baker of Pharaoh ([Gen 40:16](../kjv/gen040.htm#016).md); of
the chief butler ([Gen 40:2](../kjv/gen040.htm#002.md), etc. See also [Gen
47:6](../kjv/gen047.htm#006); [Exo 1:11](../kjv/exo001.htm#011.md); [Dan
1:7](../kjv/dan001.htm#007); [Jdg 10:18](../kjv/jdg010.htm#018.md); [Kg1
22:26](../kjv/kg1022.htm#026); [Kg1 20:15](../kjv/kg1020.htm#015.md); [Kg2
1:9](../kjv/kg2001.htm#009); [Sa2 24:2](../kjv/sa2024.htm#002).md). It is
used also of angels, guardian angels ([Dan
10:13](../kjv/dan010.htm#013), [Dan 10:20](../kjv/dan010.htm#020.md), [Dan
10:21](../kjv/dan010.htm#021); [Dan 12:1](../kjv/dan012.htm#001.md); [Dan
10:13](../kjv/dan010.htm#013); [Dan 8:25](../kjv/dan008.htm#025)). (8..md)
Pehah , whence pasha, i.e., friend of the king; adjutant; governor of a
province ([Kg2 18:24](../kjv/kg2018.htm#024.md); [Isa
36:9](../kjv/isa036.htm#009); [Jer 51:57](../kjv/jer051.htm#057.md); [Eze
23:6](../kjv/eze023.htm#006), [Eze 23:23](../kjv/eze023.htm#023.md); [Dan
3:2](../kjv/dan003.htm#002); [Est 3:12](../kjv/est003.htm#012).md), or a
perfect ([Neh 3:7](../kjv/neh003.htm#007.md); [Neh
5:14](../kjv/neh005.htm#014); [Ezr 5:3](../kjv/ezr005.htm#003.md); [Hag
1:1](../kjv/hag001.htm#001).md). This is a foreign word, Assyrian, which
was early adopted into the Hebrew idiom ([Kg1

6:7](../kjv/dan006.htm#007).md); the prefects over the Magi ([Dan

51:28](../kjv/jer051.htm#028), [Jer 51:57](../kjv/jer051.htm#057).md); also

7:5](../kjv/neh007.htm#005); [Neh 12:40](../kjv/neh012.htm#040).md). In the
New Testament there are also different Greek words rendered thus. (1.)
Meaning an ethnarch ([Co2 11:32](../kjv/co2011.htm#032).md), which was an
office distinct from military command, with considerable latitude of
application. (2.) The Procurator of Judea under the Romans ([Mat
27:2](../kjv/mat027.htm#002).md). (Compare [Luk
2:2](../kjv/luk002.htm#002.md), where the verb from which the Greek word so
rendered is derived is used.) (3.) Steward ([Gal
4:2](../kjv/gal004.htm#002)). (4..md) Governor of the feast ([Joh
2:9](../kjv/joh002.htm#009).md), who appears here to have been merely an
intimate friend of the bridegroom, and to have presided at the marriage
banquet in his stead. (5.) A director, i.e., helmsman; Lat. gubernator ,
([Jam 3:4](../kjv/jam003.htm#004).md).

<span id="009">**Gozan**</span> A region in Central Asia to which the
Israelites were carried away captive ([Kg2 17:6](../kjv/kg2017.htm#006.md);
[Ch1 5:26](../kjv/ch1005.htm#026); [Kg2 19:12](../kjv/kg2019.htm#012.md);
[Isa 37:12](../kjv/isa037.htm#012).md). It was situated in Mesopotamia, on
the river Habor ([Kg2 17:6](../kjv/kg2017.htm#006.md); [Kg2
18:11](../kjv/kg2018.htm#011).md), the Khabur, a tributary of the
Euphrates. The "river of Gozan" ([Ch1 5:26](../kjv/ch1005.htm#026).md) is
probably the upper part of the river flowing through the province of
Gozan, now Kizzel-Ozan.
