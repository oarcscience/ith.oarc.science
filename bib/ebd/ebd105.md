<span id="000">**Divorce**</span> The dissolution of the marriage tie
was regulated by the Mosaic law ([Deu 24:1](../kjv/deu024.htm#001)). The
Jews, after the Captivity, were required to dismiss the foreign women
they had married contrary to the law ([Ezr
10:11](../kjv/ezr010.htm#011)). Christ limited the permission of divorce
to the single case of adultery. It seems that it was not uncommon for
the Jews at that time to dissolve the union on very slight pretenses
([Mat 5:31](../kjv/mat005.htm#031), [Mat 5:32](../kjv/mat005.htm#032);
[Mat 19:1](../kjv/mat019.htm#001); [Mar 10:2](../kjv/mar010.htm#002);
[Luk 16:18](../kjv/luk016.htm#018)). These precepts given by Christ
regulate the law of divorce in the Christian Church.

<span id="001">**Dizahab**</span> Region of gold, a place in the desert
of Sinai, on the western shore of the Elanitic gulf ([Deu
1:1](../kjv/deu001.htm#001)). It is now called Dehab.

<span id="002">**Doctor**</span> [Luk 2:46](../kjv/luk002.htm#046); [Luk
5:17](../kjv/luk005.htm#017); [Act 5:34](../kjv/act005.htm#034)), a
teacher. The Jewish doctors taught and disputed in synagogues, or
wherever they could find an audience. Their disciples were allowed to
propose to them questions. They assumed the office without any
appointment to it. The doctors of the law were principally of the sect
of the Pharisees. Schools were established after the destruction of
Jerusalem at Babylon and Tiberias, in which academical degrees were
conferred on those who passed a certain examination. Those of the school
of Tiberias were called by the title "rabbi," and those of Babylon by
that of "master."

<span id="003">**Dodai**</span> Loving, one of David's captains ([Ch1
27:4](../kjv/ch1027.htm#004)). (See DODO \[2\].)

<span id="004">**Dodanim**</span> Leaders, a race descended from Javan
([Gen 10:4](../kjv/gen010.htm#004)). They are known in profane history
as the Dardani, originally inhabiting Illyricum. They were a
semi-Pelasgic race, and in the ethnographical table (Gen. 10) they are
grouped with the Chittim (q.v.). In [Ch1 1:7](../kjv/ch1001.htm#007),
they are called Rodanim. The LXX. and the Samaritan Version also read
Rhodii, whence some have concluded that the Rhodians, the inhabitants of
the island of Rhodes, are meant.

<span id="005">**Dodo**</span> Amatory; loving. (1.) A descendant of
Issachar ([Jdg 10:1](../kjv/jdg010.htm#001)). (2.) An Ahohite, father of
Eleazar, who was one of David's three heroes ([Sa2
23:9](../kjv/sa2023.htm#009); [Ch1 11:12](../kjv/ch1011.htm#012)). He
was the same with Dodai mentioned in [Ch1 27:4](../kjv/ch1027.htm#004).
(3.) A Bethlehemite, and father of Elhanan, who was one of David's
thirty heroes ([Sa2 23:24](../kjv/sa2023.htm#024)).

<span id="006">**Doeg**</span> Fearful, an Edomite, the chief overseer
of Saul's flocks ([Sa1 21:7](../kjv/sa1021.htm#007)). At the command of
Saul he slew the high priest Ahimelech (q.v.) at Nob, together with all
the priests to the number of eighty-five persons. (Compare [Psa
52:1](../kjv/psa052.htm#001), title.)

<span id="007">**Dog**</span> Frequently mentioned both in the Old and
New Testaments. Dogs were used by the Hebrews as a watch for their
houses ([Isa 56:10](../kjv/isa056.htm#010)), and for guarding their
flocks ([Job 30:1](../kjv/job030.htm#001)). There were also then as now
troops of semi-wild dogs that wandered about devouring dead bodies and
the offal of the streets ([Kg1 14:11](../kjv/kg1014.htm#011); [Kg1
16:4](../kjv/kg1016.htm#004); [Kg1 21:19](../kjv/kg1021.htm#019), [Kg1
21:23](../kjv/kg1021.htm#023); [Kg1 22:38](../kjv/kg1022.htm#038); [Psa
59:6](../kjv/psa059.htm#006), [Psa 59:14](../kjv/psa059.htm#014)). As
the dog was an unclean animal, the terms "dog," "dog's head," "dead
dog," were used as terms of reproach or of humiliation ([Sa1
24:14](../kjv/sa1024.htm#014); [Sa2 3:8](../kjv/sa2003.htm#008); [Sa2
9:8](../kjv/sa2009.htm#008); [Sa2 16:9](../kjv/sa2016.htm#009)). Paul
calls false apostles "dogs" ([Phi 3:2](../kjv/phi003.htm#002)). Those
who are shut out of the kingdom of heaven are also so designated ([Rev
22:15](../kjv/rev022.htm#015)). Persecutors are called "dogs" ([Psa
22:16](../kjv/psa022.htm#016)). Hazael's words, "Thy servant which is
but a dog" ([Kg2 8:13](../kjv/kg2008.htm#013)), are spoken in mock
humility = impossible that one so contemptible as he should attain to
such power.

<span id="008">**Doleful Creatures**</span> (occurring only [Isa
13:21](../kjv/isa013.htm#021). Heb. ochim , i.e., "shrieks;" hence
"howling animals"), a general name for screech owls (howlets), which
occupy the desolate palaces of Babylon. Some render the word "hyenas."

<span id="009">**Doors**</span> Moved on pivots of wood fastened in
sockets above and below ([Pro 26:14](../kjv/pro026.htm#014)). They were
fastened by a lock ([Jdg 3:23](../kjv/jdg003.htm#023), [Jdg
3:25](../kjv/jdg003.htm#025); [Sol 5:5](../kjv/sol005.htm#005)) or by a
bar ([Jdg 16:3](../kjv/jdg016.htm#003); [Job
38:10](../kjv/job038.htm#010)). In the interior of Oriental houses,
curtains were frequently used instead of doors. The entrances of the
tabernacle had curtains ([Exo 26:31](../kjv/exo026.htm#031), [Exo
26:36](../kjv/exo026.htm#036)). The "valley of Achor" is called a "door
of hope," because immediately after the execution of Achan the Lord said
to Joshua, "Fear not," and from that time Joshua went forward in a
career of uninterrupted conquest. Paul speaks of a "door opened" for the
spread of the gospel ([Co1 16:9](../kjv/co1016.htm#009); [Co2
2:12](../kjv/co2002.htm#012); [Col 4:3](../kjv/col004.htm#003)). Our
Lord says of himself, "I am the door" ([Joh
10:9](../kjv/joh010.htm#009)). John ([Rev 4:1](../kjv/rev004.htm#001))
speaks of a "door opened in heaven."
