------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="000">**Cotes**</span> Pens or enclosures for flocks ([Ch2
32:28](../kjv/ch2032.htm#028), "cotes for flocks;" R.V., "flocks in
folds").

<span id="001">**Cottage**</span> (1.) A booth in a vineyard ([Isa
1:8](../kjv/isa001.htm#008)); a temporary shed covered with leaves or
straw to shelter the watchman that kept the garden. These were slight
fabrics, and were removed when no longer needed, or were left to be
blown down in winter ([Job 27:18](../kjv/job027.htm#018)). (2.) A
lodging-place (rendered "lodge" in [Isa 1:8](../kjv/isa001.htm#008)); a
slighter structure than the "booth," as the cucumber patch is more
temporary than a vineyard ([Isa 24:20](../kjv/isa024.htm#020)). It
denotes a frail structure of boughs supported on a few poles, which is
still in use in the East, or a hammock suspended between trees, in which
the watchman was accustomed to sleep during summer. (3.) In [Zep
2:6](../kjv/zep002.htm#006) it is the rendering of the Hebrew keroth,
which some suppose to denote rather "pits" (R.V. marg., "caves") or
"wells of water," such as shepherds would sink.

<span id="002">**Couch**</span> ([Gen 49:4](../kjv/gen049.htm#004); [Ch1
5:1](../kjv/ch1005.htm#001); [Job 7:13](../kjv/job007.htm#013); [Psa
6:6](../kjv/psa006.htm#006), etc.), a seat for repose or rest. (See
BED.)

<span id="003">**Coulter**</span> ([Sa1 13:20](../kjv/sa1013.htm#020),
[Sa1 13:21](../kjv/sa1013.htm#021)), an agricultural instrument,
elsewhere called "ploughshare" ([Isa 2:4](../kjv/isa002.htm#004); [Mic
4:3](../kjv/mic004.htm#003); [Joe 3:10](../kjv/joe003.htm#010)). It was
the facing-piece of a plough, analogous to the modern coulter.

<span id="004">**Council**</span> Spoken of counsellors who sat in
public trials with the governor of a province ([Act
25:12](../kjv/act025.htm#012)). The Jewish councils were the Sanhedrim,
or supreme council of the nation, which had subordinate to it smaller
tribunals (the "judgment," perhaps, in [Mat
5:21](../kjv/mat005.htm#021), [Mat 5:22](../kjv/mat005.htm#022)) in the
cities of Palestine ([Mat 10:17](../kjv/mat010.htm#017); [Mar
13:9](../kjv/mar013.htm#009)). In the time of Christ the functions of
the Sanhedrim were limited ([Joh 16:2](../kjv/joh016.htm#002); [Co2
11:24](../kjv/co2011.htm#024)). In [Psa 68:27](../kjv/psa068.htm#027)
the word "council" means simply a company of persons. (R.V. marg.,
"company.") In ecclesiastical history the word is used to denote an
assembly of pastors or bishops for the discussion and regulation of
church affairs. The first of these councils was that of the apostles and
elders at Jerusalem, of which we have a detailed account in Acts 15.

<span id="005">**Counsellor**</span> An adviser ([Pro
11:14](../kjv/pro011.htm#014); [Pro 15:22](../kjv/pro015.htm#022)), a
king's state counsellor ([Sa2 15:12](../kjv/sa2015.htm#012)) Used once
of the Messiah ([Isa 9:6](../kjv/isa009.htm#006)). In [Mar
15:43](../kjv/mar015.htm#043); [Luk 23:50](../kjv/luk023.htm#050) the
word probably means a member of the Jewish Sanhedrim.

<span id="006">**Courses**</span> When David was not permitted to build
the temple, he proceeded, among the last acts of his life, with the
assistance of Zadok and Ahimelech, to organize the priestly and musical
services to be conducted in the house of God. (1.) He divided the
priests into twenty-four courses (1 Chr. 24:1-19), sixteen being of the
house of Eleazar and eight of that of Ithamar. Each course was under a
head or chief, and ministered for a week, the order being determined by
lot. (2.) The rest of the 38,000 Levites ([Ch1
23:4](../kjv/ch1023.htm#004)) were divided also into twenty-four
courses, each to render some allotted service in public worship: 4,000
in twenty-four courses were set apart as singers and musicians under
separate leaders ([Ch1 23:25](../kjv/ch1023.htm#025)); 4,000 as porters
or keepers of the doors and gates of the sanctuary (1 Chr. 26:1-19); and
6,000 as officers and judges to see to the administration of the law in
all civil and ecclesiastical matters ([Ch1
26:20](../kjv/ch1026.htm#020)). This arrangement was re-established by
Hezekiah ([Ch2 31:2](../kjv/ch2031.htm#002)); and afterwards the four
sacerdotal courses which are said to have returned from the Captivity
were re-divided into the original number of twenty-four by Ezra ([Ezr
6:18](../kjv/ezr006.htm#018)).

<span id="007">**Court**</span> The enclosure of the tabernacle ([Exo
27:9](../kjv/exo027.htm#009); [Exo 40:8](../kjv/exo040.htm#008)), of the
temple ([Kg1 6:36](../kjv/kg1006.htm#036)), of a prison ([Neh
3:25](../kjv/neh003.htm#025)), of a private house ([Sa2
17:18](../kjv/sa2017.htm#018)), and of a king's palace ([Kg2
20:4](../kjv/kg2020.htm#004)).

<span id="008">**Covenant**</span> A contract or agreement between two
parties. In the Old Testament the Hebrew word berith is always thus
translated. Berith is derived from a root which means "to cut," and
hence a covenant is a "cutting," with reference to the cutting or
dividing of animals into two parts, and the contracting parties passing
between them, in making a covenant (Gen. 15; [Jer
34:18](../kjv/jer034.htm#018), [Jer 34:19](../kjv/jer034.htm#019)). The
corresponding word in the New Testament Greek is diatheke , which is,
however, rendered "testament" generally in the Authorized Version. It
ought to be rendered, just as the word berith of the Old Testament,
"covenant." This word is used (1.) of a covenant or compact between man
and man ([Gen 21:32](../kjv/gen021.htm#032)), or between tribes or
nations ([Sa1 11:1](../kjv/sa1011.htm#001); [Jos
9:6](../kjv/jos009.htm#006), [Jos 9:15](../kjv/jos009.htm#015)). In
entering into a convenant, Jehovah was solemnly called on to witness the
transaction ([Gen 31:50](../kjv/gen031.htm#050)), and hence it was
called a "covenant of the Lord" ([Sa1 20:8](../kjv/sa1020.htm#008)). The
marriage compact is called "the covenant of God" ([Pro
2:17](../kjv/pro002.htm#017)), because the marriage was made in God's
name. Wicked men are spoken of as acting as if they had made a "covenant
with death" not to destroy them, or with hell not to devour them ([Isa
28:15](../kjv/isa028.htm#015), [Isa 28:18](../kjv/isa028.htm#018)). (2.)
The word is used with reference to God's revelation of himself in the
way of promise or of favour to men. Thus God's promise to Noah after the
Flood is called a covenant (Gen. 9; [Jer 33:20](../kjv/jer033.htm#020),
"my covenant"). We have an account of God's covernant with Abraham (Gen.
17, compare [Lev 26:42](../kjv/lev026.htm#042)), of the covenant of the
priesthood ([Num 25:12](../kjv/num025.htm#012), [Num
25:13](../kjv/num025.htm#013); [Deu 33:9](../kjv/deu033.htm#009); [Neh
13:29](../kjv/neh013.htm#029)), and of the covenant of Sinai ([Exo
34:27](../kjv/exo034.htm#027), [Exo 34:28](../kjv/exo034.htm#028); [Lev
26:15](../kjv/lev026.htm#015)), which was afterwards renewed at
different times in the history of Israel (Deut. 29; Josh. 24; 2 Chr. 15;
23; 29; 34; Ezra 10; Neh. 9). In conformity with human custom, God's
covenant is said to be confirmed with an oath ([Deu
4:31](../kjv/deu004.htm#031); [Psa 89:3](../kjv/psa089.htm#003)), and to
be accompanied by a sign (Gen. 9; 17). Hence the covenant is called
God's "counsel," "oath," "promise" ([Psa 89:3](../kjv/psa089.htm#003),
[Psa 89:4](../kjv/psa089.htm#004); [Psa 105:8](../kjv/psa105.htm#008);
[Heb 6:13](../kjv/heb006.htm#013); [Luk 1:68](../kjv/luk001.htm#068)).
God's covenant consists wholly in the bestowal of blessing ([Isa
59:21](../kjv/isa059.htm#021); [Jer 31:33](../kjv/jer031.htm#033), [Jer
31:34](../kjv/jer031.htm#034)). The term covenant is also used to
designate the regular succession of day and night ([Jer
33:20](../kjv/jer033.htm#020)), the Sabbath ([Exo
31:16](../kjv/exo031.htm#016)), circumcision ([Gen
17:9](../kjv/gen017.htm#009), [Gen 17:10](../kjv/gen017.htm#010)), and
in general any ordinance of God ([Jer 34:13](../kjv/jer034.htm#013),
[Jer 34:14](../kjv/jer034.htm#014)). A "covenant of salt" signifies an
everlasting covenant, in the sealing or ratifying of which salt, as an
emblem of perpetuity, is used ([Num 18:19](../kjv/num018.htm#019); [Lev
2:13](../kjv/lev002.htm#013); [Ch2 13:5](../kjv/ch2013.htm#005)).
COVENANT OF WORKS, the constitution under which Adam was placed at his
creation. In this covenant, (1.) The contracting parties were (a.) God
the moral Governor, and (b.) Adam, a free moral agent, and
representative of all his natural posterity ([Rom
5:12](../kjv/rom005.htm#012)). (2.) The promise was "life" ([Mat
19:16](../kjv/mat019.htm#016), [Mat 19:17](../kjv/mat019.htm#017); [Gal
3:12](../kjv/gal003.htm#012)). (3.) The condition was perfect obedience
to the law, the test in this case being abstaining from eating the fruit
of the "tree of knowledge," etc. (4.) The penalty was death ([Gen
2:16](../kjv/gen002.htm#016), [Gen 2:17](../kjv/gen002.htm#017)). This
covenant is also called a covenant of nature, as made with man in his
natural or unfallen state; a covenant of life, because "life" was the
promise attached to obedience; and a legal covenant, because it demanded
perfect obedience to the law. The "tree of life" was the outward sign
and seal of that life which was promised in the covenant, and hence it
is usually called the seal of that covenant. This covenant is abrogated
under the gospel, inasmuch as Christ has fulfilled all its conditions in
behalf of his people, and now offers salvation on the condition of
faith. It is still in force, however, as it rests on the immutable
justice of God, and is binding on all who have not fled to Christ and
accepted his righteousness. CONVENANT OF GRACE, the eternal plan of
redemption entered into by the three persons of the Godhead, and carried
out by them in its several parts. In it the Father represented the
Godhead in its indivisible sovereignty, and the Son his people as their
surety ([Joh 17:4](../kjv/joh017.htm#004), [Joh
17:6](../kjv/joh017.htm#006), [Joh 17:9](../kjv/joh017.htm#009); [Isa
42:6](../kjv/isa042.htm#006); [Psa 89:3](../kjv/psa089.htm#003)). The
conditions of this covenant were, (1.) On the part of the Father (a.)
all needful preparation to the Son for the accomplishment of his work
([Heb 10:5](../kjv/heb010.htm#005); [Isa 42:1](../kjv/isa042.htm#001));
(b.) support in the work ([Luk 22:43](../kjv/luk022.htm#043)); and (c.)
a glorious reward in the exaltation of Christ when his work was done
([Phi 2:6](../kjv/phi002.htm#006)), his investiture with universal
dominion ([Joh 5:22](../kjv/joh005.htm#022); [Psa
110:1](../kjv/psa110.htm#001)), his having the administration of the
covenant committed into his hands ([Mat 28:18](../kjv/mat028.htm#018);
[Joh 1:12](../kjv/joh001.htm#012); [Joh 17:2](../kjv/joh017.htm#002);
[Act 2:33](../kjv/act002.htm#033)), and in the final salvation of all
his people ([Isa 35:10](../kjv/isa035.htm#010); [Isa
53:10](../kjv/isa053.htm#010), [Isa 53:11](../kjv/isa053.htm#011); [Jer
31:33](../kjv/jer031.htm#033); [Tit 1:2](../kjv/tit001.htm#002)). (2.)
On the part of the Son the conditions were (a.) his becoming incarnate
([Gal 4:4](../kjv/gal004.htm#004), [Gal 4:5](../kjv/gal004.htm#005));
and (b.) as the second Adam his representing all his people, assuming
their place and undertaking all their obligations under the violated
covenant of works; (c.) obeying the law ([Psa
40:8](../kjv/psa040.htm#008); [Isa 42:21](../kjv/isa042.htm#021); [Joh
9:4](../kjv/joh009.htm#004), [Joh 9:5](../kjv/joh009.htm#005)), and (d.)
suffering its penalty ([Isa 53:1](../kjv/isa053.htm#001); [Co2
5:21](../kjv/co2005.htm#021); [Gal 3:13](../kjv/gal003.htm#013)), in
their stead. Christ, the mediator of, fulfils all its conditions in
behalf of his people, and dispenses to them all its blessings. In [Heb
8:6](../kjv/heb008.htm#006); [Heb 9:15](../kjv/heb009.htm#015); [Heb
12:24](../kjv/heb012.htm#024), this title is given to Christ. (See
DISPENSATION.)

<span id="009">**Covering of the Eyes**</span> Occurs only in [Gen
20:16](../kjv/gen020.htm#016). In the Revised Version the rendering is
"it (i.e., Abimelech's present of 1,000 pieces of silver to Abraham) is
for thee a covering of the eyes." This has been regarded as an implied
advice to Sarah to conform to the custom of married women, and wear a
complete veil, covering the eyes as well as the rest of the face.
