<span id="000">**Bee**</span> First mentioned in [Deu
1:44](../kjv/deu001.htm#044.md). Swarms of bees, and the danger of their
attacks, are mentioned in [Psa 118:12](../kjv/psa118.htm#012.md). Samson
found a "swarm of bees" in the carcass of a lion he had slain ([Jdg
14:8](../kjv/jdg014.htm#008).md). Wild bees are described as laying up
honey in woods and in clefts of rocks ([Deu
32:13](../kjv/deu032.htm#013); [Psa 81:16](../kjv/psa081.htm#016).md). In
[Isa 7:18](../kjv/isa007.htm#018.md) the "fly" and the "bee" are
personifications of the Egyptians and Assyrians, the inveterate enemies
of Israel.

<span id="001">**Beelzebub**</span> (Gr. form Beelzebul ), the name
given to Satan, and found only in the New Testament ([Mat
10:25](../kjv/mat010.htm#025); [Mat 12:24](../kjv/mat012.htm#024.md), [Mat
12:27](../kjv/mat012.htm#027); [Mar 3:22](../kjv/mar003.htm#022).md). It is
probably the same as Baalzebub (q.v.), the god of Ekron, meaning "the
lord of flies," or, as others think, "the lord of dung," or "the
dung-god."

<span id="002">**Beer**</span> Well. (1.) A place where a well was dug
by the direction of Moses, at the forty-fourth station of the Hebrews in
their wanderings ([Num 21:16](../kjv/num021.htm#016).md) in the wilderness
of Moab. (See WELL). (2.) A town in the tribe of Judah to which Jotham
fled for fear of Abimelech ([Jdg 9:21](../kjv/jdg009.htm#021).md). Some
have identified this place with Beeroth.

<span id="003">**Beer-elim**</span> Well of heroes, probably the name
given to Beer, the place where the chiefs of Israel dug a well ([Num
21:16](../kjv/num021.htm#016); [Isa 15:8](../kjv/isa015.htm#008).md).

<span id="004">**Beeri**</span> Illustrious, or the well-man. (1.) The
father of Judith, one of the wives of Esau ([Gen
26:34](../kjv/gen026.htm#034).md), the same as Adah ([Gen
36:2](../kjv/gen036.htm#002)). (2..md) The father of the prophet Hosea
([Hos 1:1](../kjv/hos001.htm#001).md).

<span id="005">**Beer-lahai-roi**</span> I.e., "the well of him that
liveth and seeth me," or, as some render it, "the well of the vision of
life", the well where the Lord met with Hagar ([Gen
16:7](../kjv/gen016.htm#007), [Gen 16:14](../kjv/gen016.htm#014).md). Isaac
dwelt beside this well ([Gen 24:62](../kjv/gen024.htm#062.md); [Gen
25:11](../kjv/gen025.htm#011).md). It has been identified with 'Ain
Muweileh , or Moilahhi , south-west of Beersheba, and about 12 miles W.
from Kadesh-barnea.

<span id="006">**Beeroth**</span> Wells, one of the four cities of the
Hivites which entered by fraud into a league with Joshua. It belonged to
Benjamin ([Jos 18:25](../kjv/jos018.htm#025).md). It has by some been
identified with el-Bireh on the way to Nablus, 10 miles north of
Jerusalem.

<span id="007">**Beeroth of the Children of Jaakan**</span> ([Deu
10:6](../kjv/deu010.htm#006).md). The same as Bene-jaakan ([Num
33:31](../kjv/num033.htm#031).md).

<span id="008">**Beersheba**</span> Well of the oath, or well of seven,
a well dug by Abraham, and so named because he and Abimelech here
entered into a compact ([Gen 21:31](../kjv/gen021.htm#031).md). On
re-opening it, Isaac gave it the same name ([Gen
26:31](../kjv/gen026.htm#031).md). It was a favourite place of abode of
both of these patriarchs (Gen. 21:33-22:1, [Gen
22:19](../kjv/gen022.htm#019); [Gen 26:33](../kjv/gen026.htm#033.md); [Gen
28:10](../kjv/gen028.htm#010).md). It is mentioned among the "cities" given
to the tribe of Simeon ([Jos 19:2](../kjv/jos019.htm#002.md); [Ch1
4:28](../kjv/ch1004.htm#028).md). From Dan to Beersheba, a distance of
about 144 miles ([Jdg 20:1](../kjv/jdg020.htm#001.md); [Ch1
21:2](../kjv/ch1021.htm#002); [Sa2 24:2](../kjv/sa2024.htm#002).md), became
the usual way of designating the whole Promised Land, and passed into a
proverb. After the return from the Captivity the phrase is narrowed into
"from Beersheba unto the valley of Hinnom" ([Neh
11:30](../kjv/neh011.htm#030).md). The kingdom of the ten tribes extended
from Beersheba to Mount Ephraim ([Ch2 19:4](../kjv/ch2019.htm#004).md). The
name is not found in the New Testament. It is still called by the Arabs
Bir es-Seba, i.e., "well of the seven", where there are to the present
day two principal wells and five smaller ones. It is nearly midway
between the southern end of the Dead Sea and the Mediterranean.

<span id="009">**Beetle**</span> Heb. hargol , meaning "leaper").
Mention of it is made only in [Lev 11:22](../kjv/lev011.htm#022.md), where
it is obvious the word cannot mean properly the beetle. It denotes some
winged creeper with at least four feet, "which has legs above its feet,
to leap withal." The description plainly points to the locust (q.v.).
This has been an article of food from the earliest times in the East to
the present day. The word is rendered "cricket" in the Revised Version.
