<span id="000">**Captain**</span> (1.) Heb. sar ([Sa1
22:2](../kjv/sa1022.htm#002); [Sa2 23:19](../kjv/sa2023.htm#019)).
Rendered "chief," [Gen 40:2](../kjv/gen040.htm#002); [Gen
41:9](../kjv/gen041.htm#009); rendered also "prince," [Dan
1:7](../kjv/dan001.htm#007); "ruler," [Jdg 9:30](../kjv/jdg009.htm#030);
"governor," [Kg1 22:26](../kjv/kg1022.htm#026). This same Hebrew word
denotes a military captain ([Exo 18:21](../kjv/exo018.htm#021); [Kg2
1:9](../kjv/kg2001.htm#009); [Deu 1:15](../kjv/deu001.htm#015); [Sa1
18:13](../kjv/sa1018.htm#013), etc.), the "captain of the body-guard"
([Gen 37:36](../kjv/gen037.htm#036); [Gen 39:1](../kjv/gen039.htm#001);
[Gen 41:10](../kjv/gen041.htm#010); [Jer 40:1](../kjv/jer040.htm#001)),
or, as the word may be rendered, "chief of the executioners" (marg.).
The officers of the king's body-guard frequently acted as executioners.
Nebuzar-adan ([Jer 39:13](../kjv/jer039.htm#013)) and Arioch ([Dan
2:14](../kjv/dan002.htm#014)) held this office in Babylon. The "captain
of the guard" mentioned in [Act 28:16](../kjv/act028.htm#016) was the
Praetorian prefect, the commander of the Praetorian troops. (2.) Another
word (Heb. katsin ) so translated denotes sometimes a military ([Jos
10:24](../kjv/jos010.htm#024); [Jdg 11:6](../kjv/jdg011.htm#006), [Jdg
11:11](../kjv/jdg011.htm#011); [Isa 22:3](../kjv/isa022.htm#003)
"rulers;" [Dan 11:18](../kjv/dan011.htm#018)) and sometimes a civil
command, a judge, magistrate, Arab. kady , ([Isa
1:10](../kjv/isa001.htm#010); [Isa 3:6](../kjv/isa003.htm#006); [Mic
3:1](../kjv/mic003.htm#001), [Mic 3:9](../kjv/mic003.htm#009)). (3.) It
is also the rendering of a Hebrew word ( shalish ) meaning "a third
man," or "one of three." The LXX. render in plural by tristatai ; i.e.,
"soldiers fighting from chariots," so called because each war-chariot
contained three men, one of whom acted as charioteer while the other two
fought ([Exo 14:7](../kjv/exo014.htm#007); [Exo
15:4](../kjv/exo015.htm#004); [Kg1 9:22](../kjv/kg1009.htm#022); compare
[Kg2 9:25](../kjv/kg2009.htm#025)). This word is used also to denote the
king's body-guard ([Kg2 10:25](../kjv/kg2010.htm#025); [Ch1
12:18](../kjv/ch1012.htm#018); [Ch2 11:11](../kjv/ch2011.htm#011)) or
aides-de-camp. (4.) The "captain of the temple" mentioned in [Act
4:1](../kjv/act004.htm#001); [Act 5:24](../kjv/act005.htm#024) was not a
military officer, but superintendent of the guard of priests and Levites
who kept watch in the temple by night. (Compare "the ruler of the house
of God," [Ch1 9:11](../kjv/ch1009.htm#011); [Ch2
31:13](../kjv/ch2031.htm#013); [Neh 11:11](../kjv/neh011.htm#011).) (5.)
The Captain of our salvation is a name given to our Lord ([Heb
2:10](../kjv/heb002.htm#010)), because he is the author and source of
our salvation, the head of his people, whom he is conducting to glory.
The "captain of the Lord's host" ([Jos 5:14](../kjv/jos005.htm#014),
[Jos 5:15](../kjv/jos005.htm#015)) is the name given to that mysterious
person who manifested himself to Abraham ([Gen
12:7](../kjv/gen012.htm#007)), and to Moses in the bush ([Exo
3:2](../kjv/exo003.htm#002), [Exo 3:6](../kjv/exo003.htm#006), etc.) the
Angel of the covenant. (See ANGEL.)

<span id="001">**Captive**</span> One taken in war. Captives were often
treated with great cruelty and indignity ([Kg1
20:32](../kjv/kg1020.htm#032); [Jos 10:24](../kjv/jos010.htm#024); [Jdg
1:7](../kjv/jdg001.htm#007); [Sa2 4:12](../kjv/sa2004.htm#012); [Jdg
8:7](../kjv/jdg008.htm#007); [Sa2 12:31](../kjv/sa2012.htm#031); [Ch1
20:3](../kjv/ch1020.htm#003)). When a city was taken by assault, all the
men were slain, and the women and children carried away captive and sold
as slaves ([Isa 20:1](../kjv/isa020.htm#001); [Isa
47:3](../kjv/isa047.htm#003); [Ch2 28:9](../kjv/ch2028.htm#009); [Psa
44:12](../kjv/psa044.htm#012); [Joe 3:3](../kjv/joe003.htm#003)), and
exposed to the most cruel treatment ([Nah 3:10](../kjv/nah003.htm#010);
[Zac 14:2](../kjv/zac014.htm#002); [Est 3:13](../kjv/est003.htm#013);
[Kg2 8:12](../kjv/kg2008.htm#012); [Isa 13:16](../kjv/isa013.htm#016),
[Isa 13:18](../kjv/isa013.htm#018)). Captives were sometimes carried
away into foreign countries, as was the case with the Jews ([Jer
20:5](../kjv/jer020.htm#005); [Jer 39:9](../kjv/jer039.htm#009), [Jer
39:10](../kjv/jer039.htm#010); [Jer 40:7](../kjv/jer040.htm#007)).

<span id="002">**Captivity**</span> (1.) Of Israel. The kingdom of the
ten tribes was successively invaded by several Assyrian kings. Pul
(q.v.) imposed a tribute on Menahem of a thousand talents of silver
([Kg2 15:19](../kjv/kg2015.htm#019), [Kg2 15:20](../kjv/kg2015.htm#020);
[Ch1 5:26](../kjv/ch1005.htm#026)) (762 B.C.), and Tiglath-pileser, in
the days of Pekah (738 B.C.), carried away the trans-Jordanic tribes and
the inhabitants of Galilee into Assyria ([Kg2
15:29](../kjv/kg2015.htm#029); [Isa 9:1](../kjv/isa009.htm#001)).
Subsequently Shalmaneser invaded Israel and laid siege to Samaria, the
capital of the kingdom. During the siege he died, and was succeeded by
Sargon, who took the city, and transported the great mass of the people
into Assyria (721 B.C.), placing them in Halah and in Habor, and in the
cities of the Medes ([Kg2 17:3](../kjv/kg2017.htm#003), [Kg2
17:5](../kjv/kg2017.htm#005)). Samaria was never again inhabited by the
Israelites. The families thus removed were carried to distant cities,
many of them not far from the Caspian Sea, and their place was supplied
by colonists from Babylon and Cuthah, etc. ([Kg2
17:24](../kjv/kg2017.htm#024)). Thus terminated the kingdom of the ten
tribes, after a separate duration of two hundred and fifty-five years
(975-721 B.C.). Many speculations have been indulged in with reference
to these ten tribes. But we believe that all, except the number that
probably allied themselves with Judah and shared in their restoration
under Cyrus, are finally lost. "Like the dew on the mountain, Like the
foam on the river, Like the bubble on the fountain, They are gone, and
for ever." (2.) Of Judah. In the third year of Jehoiachim, the
eighteenth king of Judah (605 B.C.), Nebuchadnezzar having overcome the
Egyptians at Carchemish, advanced to Jerusalem with a great army. After
a brief siege he took that city, and carried away the vessels of the
sanctuary to Babylon, and dedicated them in the Temple of Belus ([Kg2
24:1](../kjv/kg2024.htm#001); [Ch2 36:6](../kjv/ch2036.htm#006), [Ch2
36:7](../kjv/ch2036.htm#007); [Dan 1:1](../kjv/dan001.htm#001), [Dan
1:2](../kjv/dan001.htm#002)). He also carried away the treasures of the
king, whom he made his vassal. At this time, from which is dated the
"seventy years" of captivity (Jer. 25; [Dan 9:1](../kjv/dan009.htm#001),
[Dan 9:2](../kjv/dan009.htm#002)), Daniel and his companions were
carried to Babylon, there to be brought up at the court and trained in
all the learning of the Chaldeans. After this, in the fifth year of
Jehoiakim, a great national fast was appointed ([Jer
36:9](../kjv/jer036.htm#009)), during which the king, to show his
defiance, cut up the leaves of the book of Jeremiah's prophecies as they
were read to him in his winter palace, and threw them into the fire. In
the same spirit he rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar ([Kg2
24:1](../kjv/kg2024.htm#001)), who again a second time (598 B.C.)
marched against Jerusalem, and put Jehoiachim to death, placing his son
Jehoiachin on the throne in his stead. But Jehoiachin's counsellors
displeasing Nebuchadnezzar, he again a third time turned his army
against Jerusalem, and carried away to Babylon a second detachment of
Jews as captives, to the number of 10,000 ([Kg2
24:13](../kjv/kg2024.htm#013); [Jer 24:1](../kjv/jer024.htm#001); [Ch2
36:10](../kjv/ch2036.htm#010)), among whom were the king, with his
mother and all his princes and officers, also Ezekiel, who with many of
his companions were settled on the banks of the river Chebar (q.v.). He
also carried away all the remaining treasures of the temple and the
palace, and the golden vessels of the sanctuary. Mattaniah, the uncle of
Jehoiachin, was now made king over what remained of the kingdom of
Judah, under the name of Zedekiah ([Kg2 24:17](../kjv/kg2024.htm#017);
[Ch2 36:10](../kjv/ch2036.htm#010)). After a troubled reign of eleven
years his kingdom came to an end ([Ch2 36:11](../kjv/ch2036.htm#011)).
Nebuchadnezzar, with a powerful army, besieged Jerusalem, and Zedekiah
became a prisoner in Babylon. His eyes were put out, and he was kept in
close confinement till his death ([Kg2 25:7](../kjv/kg2025.htm#007)).
The city was spoiled of all that was of value, and then given up to the
flames. The temple and palaces were consumed, and the walls of the city
were levelled with the ground (586 B.C.), and all that remained of the
people, except a number of the poorest class who were left to till the
ground and dress the vineyards, were carried away captives to Babylon.
This was the third and last deportation of Jewish captives. The land was
now utterly desolate, and was abondoned to anarchy. In the first year of
his reign as king of Babylon (536 B.C.), Cyrus issued a decree
liberating the Jewish captives, and permitting them to return to
Jerusalem and rebuild the city and the temple ([Ch2
36:22](../kjv/ch2036.htm#022), [Ch2 36:23](../kjv/ch2036.htm#023); [Ezr
1:1](../kjv/ezr001.htm#001); 2). The number of the people forming the
first caravan, under Zerubbabel, amounted in all to 42,360 ([Ezr
2:64](../kjv/ezr002.htm#064), [Ezr 2:65](../kjv/ezr002.htm#065)),
besides 7,337 men-servants and maid-servants. A considerable number,
12,000 probably, from the ten tribes who had been carried away into
Assyria no doubt combined with this band of liberated captives. At a
later period other bands of the Jews returned (1) under Ezra ([Ezr
7:7](../kjv/ezr007.htm#007)) (458 B.C.), and (2) Nehemiah ([Neh
7:66](../kjv/neh007.htm#066)) (445 B.C.). But the great mass of the
people remained still in the land to which they had been carried, and
became a portion of the Jews of the "dispersion" ([Joh
7:35](../kjv/joh007.htm#035); [Pe1 1:1](../kjv/pe1001.htm#001)). The
whole number of the exiles that chose to remain was probably about six
times the number of those who returned.

<span id="003">**Carbuncle**</span> ([Exo 28:17](../kjv/exo028.htm#017);
[Exo 39:10](../kjv/exo039.htm#010); [Eze 28:13](../kjv/eze028.htm#013)).
Heb. barkath ; LXX. smaragdos ; Vulgate, smaragdus ; Revised Version,
marg., " emerald ." The Hebrew word is from a root meaning "to glitter,"
"lighten," "flash." When held up to the sun, this gem shines like a
burning coal, a dark-red glowing coal, and hence is called
"carbunculus", i.e., a little coal. It was one of the jewels in the
first row of the high priest's breastplate. It has been conjectured by
some that the garnet is meant. In [Isa 54:12](../kjv/isa054.htm#012) the
Hebrew word is 'ekdah , used in the prophetic description of the glory
and beauty of the mansions above. Next to the diamond it is the hardest
and most costly of all precious stones.

<span id="004">**Carcase**</span> Contact with a, made an Israelite
ceremonially unclean, and made whatever he touched also unclean,
according to the Mosaic law ([Hag 2:13](../kjv/hag002.htm#013); compare
[Num 19:16](../kjv/num019.htm#016), [Num 19:22](../kjv/num019.htm#022);
[Lev 11:39](../kjv/lev011.htm#039)).

<span id="005">**Carchemish**</span> Fortress of Chemosh, a city on the
west bank of the Euphrates ([Jer 46:2](../kjv/jer046.htm#002); [Ch2
35:20](../kjv/ch2035.htm#020)), not, as was once supposed, the Circesium
at the confluence of the Chebar and the Euphrates, but a city
considerably higher up the river, and commanding the ordinary passage of
the Euphrates; probably identical with Hierapolis. It was the capital of
the kingdom of the northern Hittites. The Babylonian army, under
Nebuchadnezzar, the son of Nabopolassar, here met and conquered the army
of Pharaoh-necho, king of Egypt (607 B.C.). It is mentioned in monuments
in 1600 B.C. and down to 717 B.C..

<span id="006">**Carmel**</span> A park; generally with the article,
"the park." (1.) A prominent headland of Central Palestine, consisting
of several connected hills extending from the plain of Esdraelon to the
sea, a distance of some 12 miles or more. At the east end, in its
highest part, it is 1,728 feet high, and at the west end it forms a
promontory to the bay of Acre about 600 feet above the sea. It lay
within the tribe of Asher. It was here, at the east end of the ridge, at
a place called el-Mukhrakah (i.e., the place of burning), that Elijah
brought back the people to their allegiance to God, and slew the
prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18). Here were consumed the "fifties" of the
royal guard; and here also Elisha received the visit of the bereaved
mother whose son was restored by him to life ([Kg2
4:25](../kjv/kg2004.htm#025)). "No mountain in or around Palestine
retains its ancient beauty so much as Carmel. Two or three villages and
some scattered cottages are found on it; its groves are few but
luxuriant; it is no place for crags and precipices or rocks of wild
goats; but its surface is covered with a rich and constant verdure."
"The whole mountain-side is dressed with blossom, and flowering shrubs,
and fragrant herbs." The western extremity of the ridge is, however,
more rocky and bleak than the eastern. The head of the bride in [Sol
7:5](../kjv/sol007.htm#005) is compared to Carmel. It is ranked with
Bashan on account of its rich pastures ([Isa
33:9](../kjv/isa033.htm#009); [Jer 50:19](../kjv/jer050.htm#019); [Amo
1:2](../kjv/amo001.htm#002)). The whole ridge is deeply furrowed with
rocky ravines filled with dense jungle. There are many caves in its
sides, which at one time were inhabited by swarms of monks. These caves
are referred to in [Amo 9:3](../kjv/amo009.htm#003). To them Elijah and
Elisha often resorted ([Kg1 18:19](../kjv/kg1018.htm#019), [Kg1
18:42](../kjv/kg1018.htm#042); [Kg2 2:25](../kjv/kg2002.htm#025)). On
its north-west summit there is an ancient establishment of Carmelite
monks. Vineyards have recently been planted on the mount by the German
colonists of Haifa. The modern Arabic name of the mount is Kurmul , but
more commonly Jebel Mar Elyas, i.e., Mount St. Elias, from the Convent
of Elias. (2.) A town in the hill country of Judah ([Jos
15:55](../kjv/jos015.htm#055)), the residence of Nabal ([Sa1
25:2](../kjv/sa1025.htm#002), [Sa1 25:5](../kjv/sa1025.htm#005), [Sa1
25:7](../kjv/sa1025.htm#007), [Sa1 25:40](../kjv/sa1025.htm#040)), and
the native place of Abigail, who became David's wife ([Sa1
27:3](../kjv/sa1027.htm#003)). Here king Uzziah had his vineyards ([Ch2
26:10](../kjv/ch2026.htm#010)). The ruins of this town still remain
under the name of Kurmul, about 10 miles south-south-east of Hebron,
close to those of Maon.

<span id="007">**Carmi**</span> Vine-dresser. (1.) The last named of the
four sons of Reuben ([Gen 46:9](../kjv/gen046.htm#009)). (2.) A
descendant of Judah ([Ch1 4:1](../kjv/ch1004.htm#001)). He is elsewhere
([Ch1 2:18](../kjv/ch1002.htm#018)) called Caleb (q.v.). (3.) The son of
Zimri, and the father of Achan ([Jos 7:1](../kjv/jos007.htm#001)), "the
troubler of Israel."

<span id="008">**Carnal**</span> Unconverted men are so called ([Co1
3:3](../kjv/co1003.htm#003)). They are represented as of a "carnal mind,
which is enmity against God" ([Rom 8:6](../kjv/rom008.htm#006), [Rom
8:7](../kjv/rom008.htm#007)). Enjoyments that minister to the wants and
desires of man's animal nature are so called ([Rom
15:27](../kjv/rom015.htm#027); [Co1 9:11](../kjv/co1009.htm#011)). The
ceremonial of the Mosaic law is spoken of as "carnal," because it
related to things outward, the bodies of men and of animals, and the
purification of the flesh ([Heb 7:16](../kjv/heb007.htm#016); [Heb
9:10](../kjv/heb009.htm#010)). The weapons of Christian warfare are "not
carnal", that is, they are not of man's device, nor are wielded by human
power ([Co2 10:4](../kjv/co2010.htm#004)).

<span id="009">**Carpenter**</span> An artificer in stone, iron, and
copper, as well as in wood ([Sa2 5:11](../kjv/sa2005.htm#011); [Ch1
14:1](../kjv/ch1014.htm#001); [Mar 6:3](../kjv/mar006.htm#003)). The
tools used by carpenters are mentioned in [Sa1
13:19](../kjv/sa1013.htm#019), [Sa1 13:20](../kjv/sa1013.htm#020); [Jdg
4:21](../kjv/jdg004.htm#021); [Isa 10:15](../kjv/isa010.htm#015); [Isa
44:13](../kjv/isa044.htm#013). It was said of our Lord, "Is not this the
carpenter's son?" ([Mat 13:55](../kjv/mat013.htm#055)); also, "Is not
this the carpenter?" ([Mar 6:3](../kjv/mar006.htm#003)). Every Jew, even
the rabbis, learned some handicraft: Paul was a tentmaker. "In the
cities the carpenters would be Greeks, and skilled workmen; the
carpenter of a provincial village could only have held a very humble
position, and secured a very moderate competence."
