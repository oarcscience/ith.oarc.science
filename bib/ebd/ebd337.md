<span id="000">**Shibmah**</span> Fragrance, a town of Reuben, east of
Jordan ([Num 32:38](../kjv/num032.htm#038)).

<span id="001">**Shield**</span> Used in defensive warfare, varying at
different times and under different circumstances in size, form, and
material ([Sa1 17:7](../kjv/sa1017.htm#007); [Sa2
1:21](../kjv/sa2001.htm#021); [Kg1 10:17](../kjv/kg1010.htm#017); [Ch1
12:8](../kjv/ch1012.htm#008), [Ch1 12:24](../kjv/ch1012.htm#024), [Ch1
12:34](../kjv/ch1012.htm#034); [Isa 22:6](../kjv/isa022.htm#006); [Eze
39:9](../kjv/eze039.htm#009); [Nah 2:3](../kjv/nah002.htm#003)). Used
figuratively of God and of earthly princes as the defenders of their
people ([Gen 15:1](../kjv/gen015.htm#001); [Deu
33:29](../kjv/deu033.htm#029); [Psa 33:20](../kjv/psa033.htm#020); [Psa
84:11](../kjv/psa084.htm#011)). Faith is compared to a shield ([Eph
6:16](../kjv/eph006.htm#016)). Shields were usually "anointed" ([Isa
21:5](../kjv/isa021.htm#005)), in order to preserve them, and at the
same time make the missiles of the enemy glide off them more easily.

<span id="002">**Shiggaion**</span> From the verb shagah, "to reel about
through drink," occurs in the title of Ps. 7. The plural form,
shigionoth, is found in [Hab 3:1](../kjv/hab003.htm#001). The word
denotes a lyrical poem composed under strong mental emotion; a song of
impassioned imagination accompanied with suitable music; a
dithyrambicode.

<span id="003">**Shihon**</span> Overturning, a town of Issachar ([Jos
19:19](../kjv/jos019.htm#019)).

<span id="004">**Shihor**</span> Dark, ([Ch1
13:5](../kjv/ch1013.htm#005)), the southwestern boundary of Canaan, the
Wady el-'Arish . (See SIHOR; NILE.)

<span id="005">**Shihor-Libnath**</span> Black - white, a stream on the
borders of Asher, probably the modern Nahr Zerka, i.e., the "crocodile
brook," or "blue river", which rises in the Carmel range and enters the
Mediterranean a little to the north of Caesarea ([Jos
19:26](../kjv/jos019.htm#026)). Crocodiles are still found in the Zerka.
Thomson suspects "that long ages ago some Egyptians, accustomed to
worship this ugly creature, settled here (viz., at Caesarea), and
brought their gods with them. Once here they would not easily be
exterminated" (The Land and the Book).

<span id="006">**Shilhim**</span> Aqueducts, a town in the south of
Judah ([Jos 15:32](../kjv/jos015.htm#032)); called also Sharuhen and
Shaaraim ([Jos 19:6](../kjv/jos019.htm#006)).

<span id="007">**Shiloah, The Waters of**</span> =Siloah ([Neh
3:15](../kjv/neh003.htm#015)) and Siloam(q.v.)

<span id="008">**Shiloh**</span> (1.) Generally understood as denoting
the Messiah, "the peaceful one," as the word signifies ([Gen
49:10](../kjv/gen049.htm#010)). The Vulgate Version translates the word,
"he who is to be sent," in allusion to the Messiah; the Revised Version,
margin, "till he come to Shiloh;" and the LXX., "until that which is his
shall come to Shiloh." It is most simple and natural to render the
expression, as in the Authorized Version, "till Shiloh come,"
interpreting it as a proper name (compare [Isa
9:6](../kjv/isa009.htm#006)). (2.) A place of rest, a city of Ephraim,
"on the north side of Bethel," from which it is distant 10 miles ([Jdg
21:19](../kjv/jdg021.htm#019)); the modern Seilun (the Arabic for
Shiloh), a "mass of shapeless ruins." Here the tabernacle was set up
after the Conquest ([Jos 18:1](../kjv/jos018.htm#001)), where it
remained during all the period of the judges till the ark fell into the
hands of the Philistines. "No spot in Central Palestine could be more
secluded than this early sanctuary, nothing more featureless than the
landscape around; so featureless, indeed, the landscape and so secluded
the spot that from the time of St. Jerome till its re-discovery by Dr.
Robinson in 1838 the very site was forgotten and unknown." It is
referred to by Jeremiah ([Jer 7:12](../kjv/jer007.htm#012), [Jer
7:14](../kjv/jer007.htm#014); [Jer 26:4](../kjv/jer026.htm#004)) five
hundred years after its destruction.

<span id="009">**Shilonite**</span> Ahijah the prophet, whose home was
in Shiloh, is so designated ([Kg1 11:29](../kjv/kg1011.htm#029); [Kg1
15:29](../kjv/kg1015.htm#029)). The plural form occurs ([Ch1
9:5](../kjv/ch1009.htm#005)), denoting the descendants of Shelah,
Judah's youngest son.
