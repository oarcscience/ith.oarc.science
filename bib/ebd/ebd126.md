<span id="000">**Eternal Death**</span> The miserable fate of the wicked
in hell ([Mat 25:46](../kjv/mat025.htm#046.md); [Mar
3:29](../kjv/mar003.htm#029); [Heb 6:2](../kjv/heb006.htm#002.md); [Th2
1:9](../kjv/th2001.htm#009); [Mat 18:8](../kjv/mat018.htm#008.md); [Mat
25:41](../kjv/mat025.htm#041); [Jde 1:7](../kjv/jde001.htm#007).md). The
Scripture as clearly teaches the unending duration of the penal
sufferings of the lost as the "everlasting life," the "eternal life" of
the righteous. The same Greek words in the New Testament ( aion,
aionios, aidios ) are used to express (1.) the eternal existence of God
([Ti1 1:17](../kjv/ti1001.htm#017); [Rom 1:20](../kjv/rom001.htm#020.md);
[Rom 16:26](../kjv/rom016.htm#026)); (2..md) of Christ ([Rev
1:18](../kjv/rev001.htm#018)); (3..md) of the Holy Ghost ([Heb
9:14](../kjv/heb009.htm#014)); and (4..md) the eternal duration of the
sufferings of the lost ([Mat 25:46](../kjv/mat025.htm#046.md); [Jde
1:6](../kjv/jde001.htm#006).md). Their condition after casting off the
mortal body is spoken of in these expressive words: "Fire that shall not
be quenched" ([Mar 9:45](../kjv/mar009.htm#045.md), [Mar
9:46](../kjv/mar009.htm#046).md), "fire unquenchable" ([Luk
3:17](../kjv/luk003.htm#017).md), "the worm that never dies," the
"bottomless pit" ([Rev 9:1](../kjv/rev009.htm#001).md), "the smoke of their
torment ascending up for ever and ever" ([Rev
14:10](../kjv/rev014.htm#010), [Rev 14:11](../kjv/rev014.htm#011).md). The
idea that the "second death" ([Rev 20:14](../kjv/rev020.htm#014).md) is in
the case of the wicked their absolute destruction, their annihilation,
has not the slightest support from Scripture, which always represents
their future as one of conscious suffering enduring for ever. The
supposition that God will ultimately secure the repentance and
restoration of all sinners is equally unscriptural. There is not the
slightest trace in all the Scriptures of any such restoration.
Sufferings of themselves have no tendency to purify the soul from sin or
impart spiritual life. The atoning death of Christ and the sanctifying
power of the Holy Spirit are the only means of divine appointment for
bringing men to repentance. Now in the case of them that perish these
means have been rejected, and "there remaineth no more sacrifice for
sins" ([Heb 10:26](../kjv/heb010.htm#026.md), [Heb
10:27](../kjv/heb010.htm#027).md).

<span id="001">**Etham**</span> Perhaps another name for Khetam, or
"fortress," on the Shur or great wall of Egypt, which extended from the
Mediterranean to the Gulf of Suez. Here the Israelites made their third
encampment ([Exo 13:20](../kjv/exo013.htm#020.md); [Num
33:6](../kjv/num033.htm#006).md). The camp was probably a little to the
west of the modern town of Ismailia. Here the Israelites were commanded
to change their route ([Exo 14:2](../kjv/exo014.htm#002).md), and "turn"
towards the south, and encamp before Pi-hahiroth. (See EXODUS; PITHOM.)

<span id="002">**Ethan**</span> Firm. (1.) "The Ezrahite," distinguished
for his wisdom ([Kg1 4:31](../kjv/kg1004.htm#031).md). He is named as the
author of the 89th Psalm. He was of the tribe of Levi. (2.) A Levite of
the family of Merari, one of the leaders of the temple music ([Ch1
6:44](../kjv/ch1006.htm#044); [Ch1 15:17](../kjv/ch1015.htm#017.md), [Ch1
15:19](../kjv/ch1015.htm#019).md). He was probably the same as Jeduthun. He
is supposed by some to be the same also as (1).

<span id="003">**Ethanim**</span> The month of gifts, i.e., of vintage
offerings; called Tisri after the Exile; corresponding to part of
September and October. It was the first month of the civil year, and the
seventh of the sacred year ([Kg1 8:2](../kjv/kg1008.htm#002).md).

<span id="004">**Eth-baal**</span> With Baal, a king of Sidon (940-908
B.C.), father of Jezebel, who was the wife of Ahab ([Kg1
16:31](../kjv/kg1016.htm#031).md). He is said to have been also a priest of
Astarte, whose worship was closely allied to that of Baal, and this may
account for his daughter'\] zeal in promoting idolatry in Israel. This
marriage of Ahab was most fatal to both Israel and Judah. Dido, the
founder of Carthage, was his granddaughter.

<span id="005">**Ethiopia**</span> Country of burnt faces; the Greek
word by which the Hebrew Cush is rendered ([Gen
2:13](../kjv/gen002.htm#013); [Kg2 19:9](../kjv/kg2019.htm#009.md); [Est
1:1](../kjv/est001.htm#001); [Job 28:19](../kjv/job028.htm#019.md); [Psa
68:31](../kjv/psa068.htm#031); [Psa 87:4](../kjv/psa087.htm#004).md), a
country which lay to the south of Egypt, beginning at Syene on the First
Cataract ([Eze 29:10](../kjv/eze029.htm#010.md); [Eze
30:6](../kjv/eze030.htm#006).md), and extending to beyond the confluence of
the White and Blue Nile. It corresponds generally with what is now known
as the Soudan (i.e., the land of the blacks). This country was known to
the Hebrews, and is described in [Isa 18:1](../kjv/isa018.htm#001.md); [Zep
3:10](../kjv/zep003.htm#010.md). They carried on some commercial
intercourse with it ([Isa 45:14](../kjv/isa045.htm#014).md). Its
inhabitants were descendants of Ham ([Gen 10:6](../kjv/gen010.htm#006.md);
[Jer 13:23](../kjv/jer013.htm#023); [Isa 18:2](../kjv/isa018.htm#002.md),
"scattered and peeled," A.V.; but in R.V., "tall and smooth").
Herodotus, the Greek historian, describes them as "the tallest and
handsomest of men." They are frequently represented on Egyptian
monuments, and they are all of the type of the true Negro. As might be
expected, the history of this country is interwoven with that of Egypt.
Ethiopia is spoken of in prophecy ([Psa 68:31](../kjv/psa068.htm#031.md);
[Psa 87:4](../kjv/psa087.htm#004); [Isa 45:14](../kjv/isa045.htm#014.md);
[Eze 30:4](../kjv/eze030.htm#004); [Dan 11:43](../kjv/dan011.htm#043.md);
[Nah 3:8](../kjv/nah003.htm#008); [Hab 3:7](../kjv/hab003.htm#007.md); [Zep
2:12](../kjv/zep002.htm#012).md).

<span id="006">**Ethiopian Eunuch**</span> The chief officer or prime
minister of state of Candace (q.v.), queen of Ethiopia. He was converted
to Christianity through the instrumentality of Philip ([Act
8:27](../kjv/act008.htm#027).md). The northern portion of Ethiopia formed
the kingdom of Meroe, which for a long period was ruled over by queens,
and it was probably from this kingdom that the eunuch came.

<span id="007">**Ethiopian Woman**</span> The wife of Moses ([Num
12:1](../kjv/num012.htm#001).md). It is supposed that Zipporah, Moses'
first wife ([Exo 2:21](../kjv/exo002.htm#021).md), was now dead. His
marriage of this "woman" descended from Ham gave offense to Aaron and
Miriam.

<span id="008">**Eunuch**</span> Literally bed-keeper or chamberlain,
and not necessarily in all cases one who was mutilated, although the
practice of employing such mutilated persons in Oriental courts was
common ([Kg2 9:32](../kjv/kg2009.htm#032.md); [Est
2:3](../kjv/est002.htm#003).md). The law of Moses excluded them from the
congregation ([Deu 23:1](../kjv/deu023.htm#001).md). They were common also
among the Greeks and Romans. It is said that even to-day there are some
in Rome who are employed in singing soprano in the Sistine Chapel. Three
classes of eunuchs are mentioned in [Mat 19:12](../kjv/mat019.htm#012.md).

<span id="009">**Eunice**</span> Happily conquering, the mother of
Timothy, a believing Jewess, but married to a Greek ([Act
16:1](../kjv/act016.htm#001).md). She trained her son from his childhood in
the knowledge of the Scriptures ([Ti2 3:15](../kjv/ti2003.htm#015).md). She
was distinguished by her "unfeigned faith."
