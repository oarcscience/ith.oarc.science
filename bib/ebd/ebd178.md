<span id="000">**Hiel**</span> Life of (i.e., from) God, a native of
Bethel, who built (i.e., fortified) Jericho some seven hundred years
after its destruction by the Israelites. There fell on him for such an
act the imprecation of Joshua ([Jos 6:26](../kjv/jos006.htm#026).md). He
laid the foundation in his first-born, and set up the gates in his
youngest son ([Kg1 16:34](../kjv/kg1016.htm#034).md), i.e., during the
progress of the work all his children died.

<span id="001">**Hierapolis**</span> Sacred city, a city of Phrygia,
where was a Christian church under the care of Epaphras ([Col
4:12](../kjv/col004.htm#012), [Col 4:13](../kjv/col004.htm#013).md). This
church was founded at the same time as that of Colosse. It now bears the
name of Pambuk-Kalek, i.e., "Cotton Castle", from the white appearance
of the cliffs at the base of which the ruins are found.

<span id="002">**Higgaion**</span> In [Psa 92:3](../kjv/psa092.htm#003.md)
means the murmuring tone of the harp. In [Psa
9:16](../kjv/psa009.htm#016.md) it is a musical sign, denoting probably a
pause in the instrumental interlude. In [Psa
19:14](../kjv/psa019.htm#014.md) the word is rendered "meditation;" and in
[Lam 3:62](../kjv/lam003.htm#062), "device" (R.V., "imagination".md).

<span id="003">**High Place**</span> An eminence, natural or artificial,
where worship by sacrifice or offerings was made ([Kg1
13:32](../kjv/kg1013.htm#032); [Kg2 17:29](../kjv/kg2017.htm#029).md). The
first altar after the Flood was built on a mountain ([Gen
8:20](../kjv/gen008.htm#020).md). Abraham also built an altar on a mountain
([Gen 12:7](../kjv/gen012.htm#007), [Gen 12:8](../kjv/gen012.htm#008).md).
It was on a mountain in Gilead that Laban and Jacob offered sacrifices
([Gen 31:54](../kjv/gen031.htm#054).md). After the Israelites entered the
Promised Land they were strictly enjoined to overthrow the high places
of the Canaanites ([Exo 34:13](../kjv/exo034.htm#013.md); [Deu
7:5](../kjv/deu007.htm#005); [Deu 12:2](../kjv/deu012.htm#002.md), [Deu
12:3](../kjv/deu012.htm#003).md), and they were forbidden to worship the
Lord on high places ([Deu 12:11](../kjv/deu012.htm#011).md), and were
enjoined to use but one altar for sacrifices ([Lev
17:3](../kjv/lev017.htm#003), [Lev 17:4](../kjv/lev017.htm#004.md); Deut.
12; [Deu 16:21](../kjv/deu016.htm#021).md). The injunction against high
places was, however, very imperfectly obeyed, and we find again and
again mention made of them ([Kg2 14:4](../kjv/kg2014.htm#004.md); [Kg2
15:4](../kjv/kg2015.htm#004), [Kg2 15:35](../kjv/kg2015.htm#035.md); [Ch2
15:17](../kjv/ch2015.htm#017), etc..md).

<span id="004">**High Priest**</span> Aaron was the first who was
solemnly set apart to this office ([Exo 29:7](../kjv/exo029.htm#007.md);
[Exo 30:23](../kjv/exo030.htm#023); [Lev 8:12](../kjv/lev008.htm#012).md).
He wore a peculiar dress, which on his death passed to his successor in
office ([Exo 29:29](../kjv/exo029.htm#029.md), [Exo
29:30](../kjv/exo029.htm#030).md). Besides those garments which he wore in
common with all priests, there were four that were peculiar to himself
as high priest: (1.) The "robe" of the ephod, all of blue, of "woven
work," worn immediately under the ephod. It was without seam or sleeves.
The hem or skirt was ornamented with pomegranates and golden bells,
seventy-two of each in alternate order. The sounding of the bells
intimated to the people in the outer court the time when the high priest
entered into the holy place to burn incense before the Lord (Ex. 28).
(2.) The "ephod" consisted of two parts, one of which covered the back
and the other the breast, which were united by the "curious girdle." It
was made of fine twined linen, and ornamented with gold and purple. Each
of the shoulder-straps was adorned with a precious stone, on which the
names of the twelve tribes were engraved. This was the high priest's
distinctive vestment ([Sa1 2:28](../kjv/sa1002.htm#028.md); [Sa1
14:3](../kjv/sa1014.htm#003); [Sa1 21:9](../kjv/sa1021.htm#009.md); [Sa1
23:6](../kjv/sa1023.htm#006), [Sa1 23:9](../kjv/sa1023.htm#009.md); [Sa1
30:7](../kjv/sa1030.htm#007)). (3..md) The "breastplate of judgment" ([Exo
28:6](../kjv/exo028.htm#006), [Exo 28:25](../kjv/exo028.htm#025.md); [Exo
39:2](../kjv/exo039.htm#002).md) of "cunning work." It was a piece of cloth
doubled, of one span square. It bore twelve precious stones, set in four
rows of three in a row, which constituted the Urim and Thummim (q.v.).
These stones had the names of the twelve tribes engraved on them. When
the high priest, clothed with the ephod and the breastplate, inquired of
the Lord, answers were given in some mysterious way by the Urim and
Thummim ([Sa1 14:3](../kjv/sa1014.htm#003.md), [Sa1
14:18](../kjv/sa1014.htm#018), [Sa1 14:19](../kjv/sa1014.htm#019.md); [Sa1
23:2](../kjv/sa1023.htm#002), [Sa1 23:4](../kjv/sa1023.htm#004.md), [Sa1
23:9](../kjv/sa1023.htm#009), [Sa1 23:11](../kjv/sa1023.htm#011.md), [Sa1
23:12](../kjv/sa1023.htm#012); [Sa1 28:6](../kjv/sa1028.htm#006.md); [Sa2
5:23](../kjv/sa2005.htm#023)). (4..md) The "mitre," or upper turban, a
twisted band of eight yards of fine linen coiled into a cap, with a gold
plate in front, engraved with "Holiness to the Lord," fastened to it by
a ribbon of blue. To the high priest alone it was permitted to enter the
holy of holies, which he did only one a year, on the great Day of
Atonement, for "the way into the holiest of all was not yet made
manifest" (Heb. 9; 10). Wearing his gorgeous priestly vestments, he
entered the temple before all the people, and then, laying them aside
and assuming only his linen garments in secret, he entered the holy of
holies alone, and made expiation, sprinkling the blood of the sin
offering on the mercy seat, and offering up incense. Then resuming his
splendid robes, he reappeared before the people (Lev. 16). Thus the
wearing of these robes came to be identified with the Day of Atonement.
The office, dress, and ministration of the high priest were typical of
the priesthood of our Lord ([Heb 4:14](../kjv/heb004.htm#014.md); [Heb
7:25](../kjv/heb007.htm#025); [Heb 9:12](../kjv/heb009.htm#012), etc..md).
It is supposed that there were in all eighty-three high priests,
beginning with Aaron (1657 B.C.) and ending with Phannias (A.D. 70). At
its first institution the office of high priest was held for life (but
compare [Kg1 2:27](../kjv/kg1002.htm#027).md), and was hereditary in the
family of Aaron ([Num 3:10](../kjv/num003.htm#010).md). The office
continued in the line of Eleazar, Aaron's eldest son, for two hundred
and ninety-six years, when it passed to Eli, the first of the line of
Ithamar, who was the fourth son of Aaron. In this line it continued to
Abiathar, whom Solomon deposed, and appointed Zadok, of the family of
Eleazar, in his stead ([Kg1 2:35](../kjv/kg1002.htm#035).md), in which it
remained till the time of the Captivity. After the Return, Joshua, the
son of Josedek, of the family of Eleazar, was appointed to this office.
After him the succession was changed from time to time under priestly or
political influences.

<span id="005">**Highway**</span> A raised road for public use. Such
roads were not found in Palestine; hence the force of the language used
to describe the return of the captives and the advent of the Messiah
([Isa 11:16](../kjv/isa011.htm#016); [Isa 35:8](../kjv/isa035.htm#008.md);
[Isa 40:3](../kjv/isa040.htm#003); [Isa 62:10](../kjv/isa062.htm#010).md)
under the figure of the preparation of a grand thoroughfare for their
march. During their possession of Palestine the Romans constructed
several important highways, as they did in all countries which they
ruled.

<span id="006">**Hilkiah**</span> Portion of Jehovah. (1.) [Ch1
6:54](../kjv/ch1006.htm#054). (2.) [Ch1 26:11](../kjv/ch1026.htm#011.md).
(3.) The father of Eliakim ([Kg2 18:18](../kjv/kg2018.htm#018.md), [Kg2
18:26](../kjv/kg2018.htm#026), [Kg2 18:37](../kjv/kg2018.htm#037)). (4..md)
The father of Gemariah ([Jer 29:3](../kjv/jer029.htm#003)). (5..md) The
father of the prophet Jeremiah ([Jer 1:1](../kjv/jer001.htm#001)). (6..md)
The high priest in the reign of Josiah ([Ch1
6:13](../kjv/ch1006.htm#013); [Ezr 7:1](../kjv/ezr007.htm#001).md). To him
and his deputy ([Kg2 23:5](../kjv/kg2023.htm#005).md), along with the
ordinary priests and the Levites who had charge of the gates, was
entrusted the purification of the temple in Jerusalem. While this was in
progress, he discovered in some hidden corner of the building a book
called the "book of the law" ([Kg2 22:8](../kjv/kg2022.htm#008).md) and the
"book of the covenant" ([Kg2 23:2](../kjv/kg2023.htm#002).md). Some have
supposed that this "book" was nothing else than the original autograph
copy of the Pentateuch written by Moses (Deut. 31:9-26). This remarkable
discovery occurred in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign (624 B.C.),
a discovery which permanently affected the whole subsequent history of
Israel. (See JOSIAH; SHAPHAN.) (7.) [Neh 12:7](../kjv/neh012.htm#007.md).
(8.) [Neh 8:4](../kjv/neh008.htm#004.md).

<span id="007">**Hill**</span> (1.) Heb. gib'eah , a curved or rounded
hill, such as are common to Palestine ([Psa
65:12](../kjv/psa065.htm#012); [Psa 72:3](../kjv/psa072.htm#003.md); [Psa
114:4](../kjv/psa114.htm#004), [Psa 114:6](../kjv/psa114.htm#006)). (2..md)
Heb. har , properly a mountain range rather than an individual eminence
([Exo 24:4](../kjv/exo024.htm#004), [Exo 24:12](../kjv/exo024.htm#012.md),
[Exo 24:13](../kjv/exo024.htm#013), [Exo 24:18](../kjv/exo024.htm#018.md);
[Num 14:40](../kjv/num014.htm#040), [Num 14:44](../kjv/num014.htm#044.md),
[Num 14:45](../kjv/num014.htm#045).md). In [Deu
1:7](../kjv/deu001.htm#007), [Jos 9:1](../kjv/jos009.htm#001.md); [Jos
10:40](../kjv/jos010.htm#040); [Jos 11:16](../kjv/jos011.htm#016.md), it
denotes the elevated district of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim, which
forms the watershed between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. (3.)
Heb. ma'aleh in [Sa1 9:11](../kjv/sa1009.htm#011.md). Authorized Version
"hill" is correctly rendered in the Revised Version "ascent." (4.) In
[Luk 9:37](../kjv/luk009.htm#037.md) the "hill" is the Mount of
Transfiguration.

<span id="008">**Hill of Evil Counsel**</span> On the south of the
Valley of Hinnom. It is so called from a tradition that the house of the
high priest Caiaphas, when the rulers of the Jews resolved to put Christ
to death, stood here.

<span id="009">**Hillel**</span> Praising, a Pirathonite, father of the
judge Abdon ([Jdg 12:13](../kjv/jdg012.htm#013.md), [Jdg
12:15](../kjv/jdg012.htm#015).md).
