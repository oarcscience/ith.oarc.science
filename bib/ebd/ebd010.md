<span id="000">**Adoption**</span> The giving to any one the name and
place and privileges of a son who is not a son by birth. (1.) Natural.
Thus Pharaoh's daughter adopted Moses ([Exo
2:10](../kjv/exo002.htm#010)), and Mordecai Esther ([Est
2:7](../kjv/est002.htm#007)). (2.) National. God adopted Israel ([Exo
4:22](../kjv/exo004.htm#022); [Deu 7:6](../kjv/deu007.htm#006); [Hos
11:1](../kjv/hos011.htm#001); [Rom 9:4](../kjv/rom009.htm#004)). (3.)
Spiritual. An act of God's grace by which he brings men into the number
of his redeemed family, and makes them partakers of all the blessings he
has provided for them. Adoption represents the new relations into which
the believer is introduced by justification, and the privileges
connected therewith, viz., an interest in God's peculiar love ([Joh
17:23](../kjv/joh017.htm#023); [Rom 5:5](../kjv/rom005.htm#005)), a
spiritual nature ([Pe2 1:4](../kjv/pe2001.htm#004); [Joh
1:13](../kjv/joh001.htm#013)), the possession of a spirit becoming
children of God ([Pe1 1:14](../kjv/pe1001.htm#014); [Jo2
1:4](../kjv/jo2001.htm#004); [Rom 8:15](../kjv/rom008.htm#015); [Gal
5:1](../kjv/gal005.htm#001); [Heb 2:15](../kjv/heb002.htm#015)), present
protection, consolation, supplies ([Luk 12:27](../kjv/luk012.htm#027);
[Joh 14:18](../kjv/joh014.htm#018); [Co1 3:21](../kjv/co1003.htm#021);
[Co2 1:4](../kjv/co2001.htm#004)), fatherly chastisements ([Heb
12:5](../kjv/heb012.htm#005)), and a future glorious inheritance ([Rom
8:17](../kjv/rom008.htm#017), [Rom 8:23](../kjv/rom008.htm#023); [Jam
2:5](../kjv/jam002.htm#005); [Phi 3:21](../kjv/phi003.htm#021)).

<span id="001">**Adoram**</span> See ADONIRAM.

<span id="002">**Adore**</span> To worship; to express reverence and
homage. The forms of adoration among the Jews were putting off the shoes
([Exo 3:5](../kjv/exo003.htm#005); [Jos 5:15](../kjv/jos005.htm#015)),
and prostration ([Gen 17:3](../kjv/gen017.htm#003); [Psa
95:6](../kjv/psa095.htm#006); [Isa 44:15](../kjv/isa044.htm#015), [Isa
44:17](../kjv/isa044.htm#017), [Isa 44:19](../kjv/isa044.htm#019); [Isa
46:6](../kjv/isa046.htm#006)). To "kiss the Son" in [Psa
2:12](../kjv/psa002.htm#012) is to adore and worship him. (See [Dan
3:5](../kjv/dan003.htm#005), [Dan 3:6](../kjv/dan003.htm#006).) The word
itself does not occur in Scripture.

<span id="003">**Adrammelech**</span> Adar the king. (1.) An idol; a
form of the sun-god worshipped by the inhabitants of Sepharvaim ([Kg2
17:31](../kjv/kg2017.htm#031)), and brought by the Sepharvite colonists
into Samaria. (2.) A son of Sennacherib, king of Assyria ([Kg2
19:37](../kjv/kg2019.htm#037); [Isa 37:38](../kjv/isa037.htm#038)).

<span id="004">**Adramyttium**</span> A city of Asia Minor on the coast
of Mysia, which in early times was called Eolis. The ship in which Paul
embarked at Caesarea belonged to this city ([Act
27:2](../kjv/act027.htm#002)). He was conveyed in it only to Myra, in
Lycia, whence he sailed in an Alexandrian ship to Italy. It was a rare
thing for a ship to sail from any port of Palestine direct for Italy. It
still bears the name Adramyti, and is a place of some traffic.

<span id="005">**Adria**</span> ([Act 27:27](../kjv/act027.htm#027);
R.V., "the sea of Adria"), the Adriatic Sea, including in Paul's time
the whole of the Mediterranean lying between Crete and Sicily. It is the
modern Gulf of Venice, the Mare Superum of the Romans, as distinguished
from the Mare Inferum or Tyrrhenian Sea.

<span id="006">**Adriel**</span> Flock of God, the son of Barzillai, the
Meholathite, to whom Saul gave in marriage his daughter Merab ([Sa1
18:19](../kjv/sa1018.htm#019)). The five sons that sprang from this
union were put to death by the Gibeonites ([Sa2
21:8](../kjv/sa2021.htm#008), [Sa2 21:9](../kjv/sa2021.htm#009). Here it
is said that Michal "brought up" \[R.V., "bare"\] these five sons,
either that she treated them as if she had been their own mother, or
that for "Michal" we should read "Merab," as in [Sa1
18:19](../kjv/sa1018.htm#019)).

<span id="007">**Adullam**</span> One of the royal cities of the
Canaanites, now 'Aid-el-ma ([Jos 12:15](../kjv/jos012.htm#015); [Jos
15:35](../kjv/jos015.htm#035)). It stood on the old Roman road in the
valley of Elah (q.v.), which was the scene of David's memorable victory
over Goliath ([Sa1 17:2](../kjv/sa1017.htm#002)), and not far from Gath.
It was one of the towns which Rehoboam fortified against Egypt ([Ch2
11:7](../kjv/ch2011.htm#007)). It was called "the glory of Israel" ([Mic
1:15](../kjv/mic001.htm#015)). The Cave of Adullam has been discovered
about 2 miles south of the scene of David's triumph, and about 13 miles
west from Bethlehem. At this place is a hill some 500 feet high pierced
with numerous caverns, in one of which David gathered together "every
one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one
that was discontented" ([Sa1 22:2](../kjv/sa1022.htm#002)). Some of
these caverns are large enough to hold 200 or 300 men. According to
tradition this cave was at Wady Khureitun, between Bethlehem and the
Dead Sea, but this view cannot be well maintained.

<span id="008">**Adullamite**</span> An inhabitant of the city of
Adullam ([Gen 38:1](../kjv/gen038.htm#001), [Gen
38:12](../kjv/gen038.htm#012), [Gen 38:20](../kjv/gen038.htm#020)).

<span id="009">**Adultery**</span> Conjugal infidelity. An adulterer was
a man who had illicit intercourse with a married or a betrothed woman,
and such a woman was an adulteress. Intercourse between a married man
and an unmarried woman was fornication. Adultery was regarded as a great
social wrong, as well as a great sin. The Mosaic law (Num. 5:11-31)
prescribed that the suspected wife should be tried by the ordeal of the
"water of jealousy." There is, however, no recorded instance of the
application of this law. In subsequent times the Rabbis made various
regulations with the view of discovering the guilty party, and of
bringing about a divorce. It has been inferred from [Joh
8:1](../kjv/joh008.htm#001) that this sin became very common during the
age preceding the destruction of Jerusalem. Idolatry, covetousness, and
apostasy are spoken of as adultery spiritually ([Jer
3:6](../kjv/jer003.htm#006), [Jer 3:8](../kjv/jer003.htm#008), [Jer
3:9](../kjv/jer003.htm#009); [Eze 16:32](../kjv/eze016.htm#032); [Hos
1:1](../kjv/hos001.htm#001), [Hos 2:1](../kjv/hos002.htm#001), [Hos
3:1](../kjv/hos003.htm#001) [Rev 2:22](../kjv/rev002.htm#022)). An
apostate church is an adulteress ([Isa 1:21](../kjv/isa001.htm#021);
[Eze 23:4](../kjv/eze023.htm#004), [Eze 23:7](../kjv/eze023.htm#007),
[Eze 23:37](../kjv/eze023.htm#037)), and the Jews are styled "an
adulterous generation" ([Mat 12:39](../kjv/mat012.htm#039)). (Compare
Rev. 12.)
