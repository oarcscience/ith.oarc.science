<span id="000">**Tyrannus**</span> Prince, a Greek rhetorician, in whose
"school" at Ephesus Paul disputed daily for the space of two years with
those who came to him ([Act 19:9](../kjv/act019.htm#009).md). Some have
supposed that he was a Jew, and that his "school" was a private
synagogue.

<span id="001">**Tyre**</span> A rock, now es-Sur; an ancient Phoenician
city, about 23 miles, in a direct line, north of Acre, and 20 south of
Sidon. Sidon was the oldest Phoenician city, but Tyre had a longer and
more illustrious history. The commerce of the whole world was gathered
into the warehouses of Tyre. "Tyrian merchants were the first who
ventured to navigate the Mediterranean waters; and they founded their
colonies on the coasts and neighbouring islands of the Aegean Sea, in
Greece, on the northern coast of Africa, at Carthage and other places,
in Sicily and Corsica, in Spain at Tartessus, and even beyond the
pillars of Hercules at Gadeira (Cadiz)" (Driver's Isaiah). In the time
of David a friendly alliance was entered into between the Hebrews and
the Tyrians, who were long ruled over by their native kings ([Sa2
5:11](../kjv/sa2005.htm#011); [Kg1 5:1](../kjv/kg1005.htm#001.md); [Ch2
2:3](../kjv/ch2002.htm#003).md). Tyre consisted of two distinct parts, a
rocky fortress on the mainland, called "Old Tyre," and the city, built
on a small, rocky island about half-a-mile distant from the shore. It
was a place of great strength. It was besieged by Shalmaneser, who was
assisted by the Phoenicians of the mainland, for five years, and by
Nebuchadnezzar (B.C.586-573) for thirteen years, apparently without
success. It afterwards fell under the power of Alexander the Great,
after a siege of seven months, but continued to maintain much of its
commercial importance till the Christian era. It is referred to in [Mat
11:21](../kjv/mat011.htm#021) and [Act 12:20](../kjv/act012.htm#020.md). In
A.D. 1291 it was taken by the Saracens, and has remained a desolate ruin
ever since. "The purple dye of Tyre had a worldwide celebrity on account
of the durability of its beautiful tints, and its manufacture proved a
source of abundant wealth to the inhabitants of that city." Both Tyre
and Sidon "were crowded with glass-shops, dyeing and weaving
establishments; and among their cunning workmen not the least important
class were those who were celebrated for the engraving of precious
stones." ([Ch2 2:7](../kjv/ch2002.htm#007.md), [Ch2
2:14](../kjv/ch2002.htm#014).md). The wickedness and idolatry of this city
are frequently denounced by the prophets, and its final destruction
predicted ([Isa 23:1](../kjv/isa023.htm#001.md); [Jer
25:22](../kjv/jer025.htm#022.md); Ezek. 26; 28:1-19; [Amo
1:9](../kjv/amo001.htm#009), [Amo 1:10](../kjv/amo001.htm#010.md); [Zac
9:2](../kjv/zac009.htm#002).md). Here a church was founded soon after the
death of Stephen, and Paul, on his return from his third missionary
journey spent a week in intercourse with the disciples there ([Act
21:4](../kjv/act021.htm#004).md). Here the scene at Miletus was repeated on
his leaving them. They all, with their wives and children, accompanied
him to the sea-shore. The sea-voyage of the apostle terminated at
Ptolemais, about 38 miles from Tyre. Thence he proceeded to Caesarea
([Act 21:5](../kjv/act021.htm#005).md). "It is noticed on monuments as
early as B.C.1500, and claiming, according to Herodotus, to have been
founded about 2700 B.C.. It had two ports still existing, and was of
commercial importance in all ages, with colonies at Carthage (about 850
B.C.) and all over the Mediterranean. It was often attacked by Egypt and
Assyria, and taken by Alexander the Great after a terrible siege in 332
B.C.. It is now a town of 3,000 inhabitants, with ancient tombs and a
ruined cathedral. A short Phoenician text of the fourth century B.C. is
the only monument yet recovered."

<span id="002">**Tyropoeon Valley**</span> (i.e., "Valley of the
Cheesemongers"), the name given by Josephus the historian to the valley
or rugged ravine which in ancient times separated Mount Moriah from
Mount Zion. This valley, now filled up with a vast accumulation of
rubbish, and almost a plain, was spanned by bridges, the most noted of
which was Zion Bridge, which was probably the ordinary means of
communication between the royal palace on Zion and the temple. A
fragment of the arch (q.v.) of this bridge (called "Robinson's Arch"),
where it projects from the sanctuary wall, was discovered by Robinson in
1839. This arch was destroyed by the Romans when Jerusalem was taken.
The western wall of the temple area rose up from the bottom of this
valley to the height of 84 feet, where it was on a level with the area,
and above this, and as a continuance of it, the wall of Solomon's
cloister rose to the height of about 50 feet, "so that this section of
the wall would originally present to view a stupendous mass of masonry
scarcely to be surpassed by any mural masonry in the world."

<span id="003">**Ucal**</span> The name of a person to whom Agur's words
are addressed ([Pro 30:1](../kjv/pro030.htm#001).md).

<span id="004">**Ulai**</span> The Eulaus of the Greeks; a river of
Susiana. It was probably the eastern branch of the Choasper (Kerkhan),
which divided into two branches some 20 miles above the city of Susa.
Hence Daniel ([Dan 8:2](../kjv/dan008.htm#002.md), [Dan
8:16](../kjv/dan008.htm#016).md) speaks of standing "between the banks of
Ulai", i.e., between the two streams of the divided river.

<span id="005">**Ummah**</span> Vicinity, a town of Asher ([Jos
19:30](../kjv/jos019.htm#030).md).

<span id="006">**Unction**</span> ([Jo1 2:20](../kjv/jo1002.htm#020.md),
[Jo1 2:27](../kjv/jo1002.htm#027); R.V., "anointing".md). Kings, prophets,
and priests were anointed, in token of receiving divine grace. All
believers are, in a secondary sense, what Christ was in a primary sense,
"the Lord's anointed."

<span id="007">**Unicorn**</span> Described as an animal of great
ferocity and strength ([Num 23:22](../kjv/num023.htm#022.md), R.V., "wild
ox," marg., "ox-antelope;" [Num 24:8](../kjv/num024.htm#008.md); [Isa
34:7](../kjv/isa034.htm#007), R.V., "wild oxen".md), and untamable ([Job
39:9](../kjv/job039.htm#009).md). It was in reality a two-horned animal;
but the exact reference of the word so rendered (reem) is doubtful. Some
have supposed it to be the buffalo; others, the white antelope, called
by the Arabs rim. Most probably, however, the word denotes the Bos
primigenius ("primitive ox"), which is now extinct all over the world.
This was the auerochs of the Germans, and the urus described by Caesar
(Gal. Bel., vi. 28) as inhabiting the Hercynian forest. The word thus
rendered has been found in an Assyrian inscription written over the wild
ox or bison, which some also suppose to be the animal intended (compare
[Deu 33:17](../kjv/deu033.htm#017); [Psa 22:21](../kjv/psa022.htm#021.md);
[Psa 29:6](../kjv/psa029.htm#006); [Psa 92:10](../kjv/psa092.htm#010).md).

<span id="008">**Unni**</span> Afflicted. (1.) A Levite whom David
appointed to take part in bringing the ark up to Jerusalem from the
house of Obed-edom by playing the psaltery on that occasion ([Ch1
15:18](../kjv/ch1015.htm#018), [Ch1 15:20](../kjv/ch1015.htm#020)). (2..md)
A Levite who returned with Zerubbabel from the Captivity ([Neh
12:9](../kjv/neh012.htm#009).md).

<span id="009">**Upharsin**</span> And they divide, one of the words
written by the mysterious hand on the wall of Belshazzar's palace ([Dan
5:25](../kjv/dan005.htm#025).md). It is a pure Chaldean word. "Peres" is
only a simple form of the same word.
