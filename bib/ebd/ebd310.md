<span id="000">**Rei**</span> Friendly, one who maintained true
allegiance to king David ([Kg1 1:8](../kjv/kg1001.htm#008)) when
Adonijah rebelled.

<span id="001">**Reins**</span> The kidneys, the supposed seat of the
desires and affections; used metaphorically for "heart." The "reins" and
the "heart" are often mentioned together, as denoting the whole moral
constitution of man ([Psa 7:9](../kjv/psa007.htm#009); [Psa
16:7](../kjv/psa016.htm#007); [Psa 26:2](../kjv/psa026.htm#002); [Psa
139:13](../kjv/psa139.htm#013); [Jer 17:10](../kjv/jer017.htm#010),
etc.).

<span id="002">**Rekem**</span> Embroidered; variegated. (1.) One of the
five Midianite kings whom the Israelites destroyed ([Num
31:8](../kjv/num031.htm#008)). (2.) One of the sons of Hebron ([Ch1
2:43](../kjv/ch1002.htm#043), [Ch1 2:44](../kjv/ch1002.htm#044)). (3.) A
town of Benjamin ([Jos 18:27](../kjv/jos018.htm#027)).

<span id="003">**Remaliah**</span> Adorned by the Lord, the father of
Pekah, who conspired successfully against Pekahiah ([Kg2
15:25](../kjv/kg2015.htm#025), [Kg2 15:27](../kjv/kg2015.htm#027), [Kg2
15:30](../kjv/kg2015.htm#030), [Kg2 15:32](../kjv/kg2015.htm#032), [Kg2
15:37](../kjv/kg2015.htm#037); [Isa 7:1](../kjv/isa007.htm#001), [Isa
7:4](../kjv/isa007.htm#004), [Isa 7:5](../kjv/isa007.htm#005), [Isa
7:9](../kjv/isa007.htm#009); [Isa 8:6](../kjv/isa008.htm#006)).

<span id="004">**Remeth**</span> Another form of Ramah (q.v.) or Ramoth
([Ch1 6:73](../kjv/ch1006.htm#073); [Jos 19:21](../kjv/jos019.htm#021)),
and probably also of Jarmuth ([Jos 21:29](../kjv/jos021.htm#029)).

<span id="005">**Remmon-methoar**</span> ([Jos
19:13](../kjv/jos019.htm#013)), rendered correctly in the Revised
Version, "Rimmon, which stretcheth unto Neah," a landmark of Zebulun;
called also Rimmon ([Ch1 6:77](../kjv/ch1006.htm#077)).

<span id="006">**Remphan**</span> ([Act 7:43](../kjv/act007.htm#043);
R.V., "Rephan"). In [Amo 5:26](../kjv/amo005.htm#026) the Heb. Chiun
(q.v.) is rendered by the LXX. "Rephan," and this name is adopted by
Luke in his narrative of the Acts. These names represent the star-god
Saturn or Moloch.

<span id="007">**Rent**</span> ([Isa 3:24](../kjv/isa003.htm#024)),
probably a rope, as rendered in the LXX. and Vulgate and Revised
Version, or as some prefer interpreting the phrase, "girdle and robe are
torn \[i.e., are 'a rent'\] by the hand of violence."

<span id="008">**Repentance**</span> There are three Greek words used in
the New Testament to denote repentance. (1.) The verb metamelomai is
used of a change of mind, such as to produce regret or even remorse on
account of sin, but not necessarily a change of heart. This word is used
with reference to the repentance of Judas ([Mat
27:3](../kjv/mat027.htm#003)). (2.) Metanoeo , meaning to change one's
mind and purpose, as the result of after knowledge. (3.) This verb, with
the cognate noun metanoia , is used of true repentance, a change of mind
and purpose and life, to which remission of sin is promised. Evangelical
repentance consists of (1) a true sense of one's own guilt and
sinfulness; (2) an apprehension of God's mercy in Christ; (3) an actual
hatred of sin ([Psa 119:128](../kjv/psa119.htm#128); [Job
42:5](../kjv/job042.htm#005), [Job 42:6](../kjv/job042.htm#006); [Co2
7:10](../kjv/co2007.htm#010)) and turning from it to God; and (4) a
persistent endeavour after a holy life in a walking with God in the way
of his commandments. The true penitent is conscious of guilt ([Psa
51:4](../kjv/psa051.htm#004), [Psa 51:9](../kjv/psa051.htm#009)), of
pollution ([Psa 51:5](../kjv/psa051.htm#005), [Psa
51:7](../kjv/psa051.htm#007), [Psa 51:10](../kjv/psa051.htm#010)), and
of helplessness ([Psa 51:11](../kjv/psa051.htm#011); [Psa
109:21](../kjv/psa109.htm#021), [Psa 109:22](../kjv/psa109.htm#022)).
Thus he apprehends himself to be just what God has always seen him to be
and declares him to be. But repentance comprehends not only such a sense
of sin, but also an apprehension of mercy, without which there can be no
true repentance ([Psa 51:1](../kjv/psa051.htm#001); [Psa
130:4](../kjv/psa130.htm#004)).

<span id="009">**Rephael**</span> Healed of God, one of Shemaiah's sons.
He and his brethren, on account of their "strength for service," formed
one of the divisions of the temple porters ([Ch1
26:7](../kjv/ch1026.htm#007), [Ch1 26:8](../kjv/ch1026.htm#008)).
