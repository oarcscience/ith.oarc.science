<span id="000">**Mortar**</span> (1.) (Heb. homer ), cement of lime and
sand ([Gen 11:3](../kjv/gen011.htm#003.md); [Exo
1:14](../kjv/exo001.htm#014).md); also potter's clay ([Isa
41:25](../kjv/isa041.htm#025); [Nah 3:14](../kjv/nah003.htm#014)). (2..md)
Also Heb. 'aphar , usually rendered "dust," clay or mud used for cement
in building ([Lev 14:42](../kjv/lev014.htm#042.md), [Lev
14:45](../kjv/lev014.htm#045)). (3..md) For pulverizing ([Pro
27:22](../kjv/pro027.htm#022).md) grain or other substances by means of a
pestle instead of a mill. Mortars were used in the wilderness for
pounding the manna ([Num 11:8](../kjv/num011.htm#008).md). It is commonly
used in Palestine at the present day to pound wheat, from which the
Arabs make a favourite dish called kibby.

<span id="001">**Mosera**</span> A bond, one of the stations of the
Israelites in the wilderness ([Deu 10:6](../kjv/deu010.htm#006).md), at the
foot of Mount Hor. (Compare [Num 33:37](../kjv/num033.htm#037.md), [Num
33:38](../kjv/num033.htm#038).md). It has been identified with el-Tayibeh,
a small fountain at the bottom of the pass leading to the ascent of
Mount Hor.

<span id="002">**Moseroth**</span> Bonds, one of the stations in the
wilderness ([Num 33:30](../kjv/num033.htm#030.md), [Num
33:31](../kjv/num033.htm#031).md), probably the same as Mosera.

<span id="003">**Moses**</span> Drawn (or Egypt. mesu, "son;" hence
Rameses, royal son). On the invitation of Pharaoh ([Gen
45:17](../kjv/gen045.htm#017).md), Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt.
This immigration took place probably about 350 years before the birth of
Moses. Some centuries before Joseph, Egypt had been conquered by a
pastoral Semitic race from Asia, the Hyksos, who brought into cruel
subjection the native Egyptians, who were an African race. Jacob and his
retinue were accustomed to a shepherd's life, and on their arrival in
Egypt were received with favour by the king, who assigned them the "best
of the land", the land of Goshen, to dwell in. The Hyksos or "shepherd"
king who thus showed favour to Joseph and his family was in all
probability the Pharaoh Apopi (or Apopis). Thus favoured, the Israelites
began to "multiply exceedingly" ([Gen 47:27](../kjv/gen047.htm#027).md),
and extended to the west and south. At length the supremacy of the
Hyksos came to an end. The descendants of Jacob were allowed to retain
their possession of Goshen undisturbed, but after the death of Joseph
their position was not so favourable. The Egyptians began to despise
them, and the period of their "affliction" ([Gen
15:13](../kjv/gen015.htm#013).md) commenced. They were sorely oppressed.
They continued, however, to increase in numbers, and "the land was
filled with them" ([Exo 1:7](../kjv/exo001.htm#007).md). The native
Egyptians regarded them with suspicion, so that they felt all the
hardship of a struggle for existence. In process of time "a king
\[probably Seti I.\] arose who knew not Joseph" ([Exo
1:8](../kjv/exo001.htm#008)). (See PHARAOH..md) The circumstances of the
country were such that this king thought it necessary to weaken his
Israelite subjects by oppressing them, and by degrees reducing their
number. They were accordingly made public slaves, and were employed in
connection with his numerous buildings, especially in the erection of
store-cities, temples, and palaces. The children of Israel were made to
serve with rigour. Their lives were made bitter with hard bondage, and
"all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour" ([Exo
1:13](../kjv/exo001.htm#013), [Exo 1:14](../kjv/exo001.htm#014).md). But
this cruel oppression had not the result expected of reducing their
number. On the contrary, "the more the Egyptians afflicted them, the
more they multiplied and grew" ([Exo 1:12](../kjv/exo001.htm#012).md). The
king next tried, through a compact secretly made with the guild of
midwives, to bring about the destruction of all the Hebrew male children
that be born. But the king's wish was not rigorously enforced; the male
children were spared by the midwives, so that "the people multiplied"
more than ever. Thus baffled, the king issued a public proclamation
calling on the people to put to death all the Hebrew male children by
casting them into the river ([Exo 1:22](../kjv/exo001.htm#022).md). But
neither by this edict was the king's purpose effected. One of the Hebrew
households into which this cruel edict of the king brought great alarm
was that of Amram, of the family of the Kohathites ([Exo
6:16](../kjv/exo006.htm#016).md), who with his wife Jochebed and two
children, Miriam, a girl of perhaps fifteen years of age, and Aaron, a
boy of three years, resided in or near Memphis, the capital city of that
time. In this quiet home a male child was born (1571 B.C.). His mother
concealed him in the house for three months from the knowledge of the
civic authorities. But when the task of concealment became difficult,
Jochebed contrived to bring her child under the notice of the daughter
of the king by constructing for him an ark of bulrushes, which she laid
among the flags which grew on the edge of the river at the spot where
the princess was wont to come down and bathe. Her plan was successful.
The king's daughter "saw the child; and behold the child wept." The
princess (see PHARAOH's DAUGHTER \[1\]) sent Miriam, who was standing
by, to fetch a nurse. She went and brought the mother of the child, to
whom the princess said, "Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and
I will give thee thy wages." Thus Jochebed's child, whom the princess
called "Moses", i.e., "Saved from the water" ([Exo
2:10](../kjv/exo002.htm#010).md), was ultimately restored to her. As soon
as the natural time for weaning the child had come, he was transferred
from the humble abode of his father to the royal palace, where he was
brought up as the adopted son of the princess, his mother probably
accompanying him and caring still for him. He grew up amid all the
grandeur and excitement of the Egyptian court, maintaining, however,
probably a constant fellowship with his mother, which was of the highest
importance as to his religious belief and his interest in his
"brethren." His education would doubtless be carefully attended to, and
he would enjoy all the advantages of training both as to his body and
his mind. He at length became "learned in all the wisdom of the
Egyptians" ([Act 7:22](../kjv/act007.htm#022).md). Egypt had then two chief
seats of learning, or universities, at one of which, probably that of
Heliopolis, his education was completed. Moses, being now about twenty
years of age, spent over twenty more before he came into prominence in
Bible history. These twenty years were probably spent in military
service. There is a tradition recorded by Josephus that he took a lead
in the war which was then waged between Egypt and Ethiopia, in which he
gained renown as a skillful general, and became "mighty in deeds" ([Act
7:22](../kjv/act007.htm#022).md). After the termination of the war in
Ethiopia, Moses returned to the Egyptian court, where he might
reasonably have expected to be loaded with honours and enriched with
wealth. But "beneath the smooth current of his life hitherto, a life of
alternate luxury at the court and comparative hardness in the camp and
in the discharge of his military duties, there had lurked from childhood
to youth, and from youth to manhood, a secret discontent, perhaps a
secret ambition. Moses, amid all his Egyptian surroundings, had never
forgotten, had never wished to forget, that he was a Hebrew." He now
resolved to make himself acquainted with the condition of his
countrymen, and "went out unto his brethren, and looked upon their
burdens" ([Exo 2:11](../kjv/exo002.htm#011).md). This tour of inspection
revealed to him the cruel oppression and bondage under which they
everywhere groaned, and could not fail to press on him the serious
consideration of his duty regarding them. The time had arrived for his
making common cause with them, that he might thereby help to break their
yoke of bondage. He made his choice accordingly ([Heb
11:25](../kjv/heb011.htm#025).md), assured that God would bless his
resolution for the welfare of his people. He now left the palace of the
king and took up his abode, probably in his father's house, as one of
the Hebrew people who had for forty years been suffering cruel wrong at
the hands of the Egyptians. He could not remain indifferent to the state
of things around him, and going out one day among the people, his
indignation was roused against an Egyptian who was maltreating a Hebrew.
He rashly lifted up his hand and slew the Egyptian, and hid his body in
the sand. Next day he went out again and found two Hebrews striving
together. He speedily found that the deed of the previous day was known.
It reached the ears of Pharaoh (the "great Rameses," Rameses II.), who
"sought to slay Moses" ([Exo 2:15](../kjv/exo002.htm#015).md). Moved by
fear, Moses fled from Egypt, and betook himself to the land of Midian,
the southern part of the peninsula of Sinai, probably by much the same
route as that by which, forty years afterwards, he led the Israelites to
Sinai. He was providentially led to find a new home with the family of
Reuel, where he remained for forty years ([Act
7:30](../kjv/act007.htm#030).md), under training unconsciously for his
great life's work. Suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared to him in the
burning bush (Ex. 3), and commissioned him to go down to Egypt and
"bring forth the children of Israel" out of bondage. He was at first
unwilling to go, but at length he was obedient to the heavenly vision,
and left the land of Midian ([Exo 4:18](../kjv/exo004.htm#018).md). On the
way he was met by Aaron (q.v.) and the elders of Israel ([Exo
4:27](../kjv/exo004.htm#027).md). He and Aaron had a hard task before them;
but the Lord was with them (Ex. 7 - 12), and the ransomed host went
forth in triumph. (See EXODUS.) After an eventful journey to and fro in
the wilderness, we see them at length encamped in the plains of Moab,
ready to cross over the Jordan into the Promised Land. There Moses
addressed the assembled elders ([Deu 1:1](../kjv/deu001.htm#001.md); 5:1 -
26:19; 27:11 - 30:20), and gives the people his last counsels, and then
rehearses the great song (Deut. 32), clothing in fitting words the deep
emotions of his heart at such a time, and in review of such a marvelous
history as that in which he had acted so conspicuous a part. Then, after
blessing the tribes (Deut. 33), he ascends to "the mountain of Nebo
(q.v.), to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho" ([Deu
34:1](../kjv/deu034.htm#001).md), and from thence he surveys the land.
"Jehovah shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, and all Naphtali,
and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto
the utmost sea, and the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho,
the city of palm trees, unto Zoar" ([Deu 34:2](../kjv/deu034.htm#002).md),
the magnificent inheritance of the tribes of whom he had been so long
the leader; and there he died, being one hundred and twenty years old,
according to the word of the Lord, and was buried by the Lord "in a
valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor" ([Deu
34:6](../kjv/deu034.htm#006).md). The people mourned for him during thirty
days. Thus died "Moses the man of God" ([Deu
33:1](../kjv/deu033.htm#001); [Jos 14:6](../kjv/jos014.htm#006).md). He was
distinguished for his meekness and patience and firmness, and "he
endured as seeing him who is invisible." "There arose not a prophet
since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, in all
the signs and the wonders, which the Lord sent him to do in the land of
Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, and in
all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in
the sight of all Israel" ([Deu 34:10](../kjv/deu034.htm#010).md). The name
of Moses occurs frequently in the Psalms and Prophets as the chief of
the prophets. In the New Testament he is referred to as the
representative of the law and as a type of Christ ([Joh
1:17](../kjv/joh001.htm#017); [Co2 3:13](../kjv/co2003.htm#013.md); [Heb
3:5](../kjv/heb003.htm#005), [Heb 3:6](../kjv/heb003.htm#006).md). Moses is
the only character in the Old Testament to whom Christ likens himself
([Joh 5:46](../kjv/joh005.htm#046.md); compare [Deu
18:15](../kjv/deu018.htm#015), [Deu 18:18](../kjv/deu018.htm#018.md), [Deu
18:19](../kjv/deu018.htm#019); [Act 7:37](../kjv/act007.htm#037).md). In
Heb. 3:1-19 this likeness to Moses is set forth in various particulars.
In [Jde 1:9](../kjv/jde001.htm#009.md) mention is made of a contention
between Michael and the devil about the body of Moses. This dispute is
supposed to have had reference to the concealment of the body of Moses
so as to prevent idolatry.

<span id="004">**Mote**</span> (Gr. karphos , something dry, hence a
particle of wood or chaff, etc.). A slight moral defect is likened to a
mote ([Mat 7:3](../kjv/mat007.htm#003.md); [Luk
6:41](../kjv/luk006.htm#041), [Luk 6:42](../kjv/luk006.htm#042).md).

<span id="005">**Moth**</span> Heb. 'ash , from a root meaning "to fall
away," as moth-eaten garments fall to pieces ([Job
4:19](../kjv/job004.htm#019); [Job 13:28](../kjv/job013.htm#028.md); [Isa
50:9](../kjv/isa050.htm#009); [Isa 51:8](../kjv/isa051.htm#008.md); [Hos
5:12](../kjv/hos005.htm#012).md). Gr. ses , thus rendered in [Mat
6:19](../kjv/mat006.htm#019), [Mat 6:20](../kjv/mat006.htm#020.md); [Luk
12:33](../kjv/luk012.htm#033.md). Allusion is thus made to the destruction
of clothing by the larvae of the clothes-moth. This is the only
lepidopterous insect referred to in Scripture.

<span id="006">**Mouldy**</span> Of the Gibeonites it is said that "all
the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy" ([Jos
9:5](../kjv/jos009.htm#005), [Jos 9:12](../kjv/jos009.htm#012).md). The
Hebrew word here rendered "mouldy" (nikuddim) is rendered "cracknels" in
[Kg1 14:3](../kjv/kg1014.htm#003.md), and denotes a kind of crisp cake. The
meaning is that the bread of the Gibeonites had become dry and hard,
hard as biscuits, and thus was an evidence of the length of the journey
they had traveled.

<span id="007">**Mount**</span> Palestine is a hilly country ([Deu
3:25](../kjv/deu003.htm#025); [Deu 11:11](../kjv/deu011.htm#011.md); [Eze
34:13](../kjv/eze034.htm#013).md). West of Jordan the mountains stretch
from Lebanon far down into Galilee, terminating in Carmel. The isolated
peak of Tabor rises from the elevated plain of Esdraelon, which, in the
south, is shut in by hills spreading over the greater part of Samaria.
The mountains of Western and Middle Palestine do not extend to the sea,
but gently slope into plains, and toward the Jordan fall down into the
Ghor. East of the Jordan the Anti-Lebanon, stretching south, terminates
in the hilly district called Jebel Heish, which reaches down to the Sea
of Gennesareth. South of the river Hieromax there is again a succession
of hills, which are traversed by wadies running toward the Jordan. These
gradually descend to a level at the river Arnon, which was the boundary
of the ancient trans-Jordanic territory toward the south. The
composition of the Palestinian hills is limestone, with occasional
strata of chalk, and hence the numerous caves, some of large extent,
found there.

<span id="008">**Mount of the Amalekites**</span> A place near Pirathon
(q.v.), in the tribe of Ephraim ([Jdg 12:15](../kjv/jdg012.htm#015).md).

<span id="009">**Mount of the Amorites**</span> The range of hills which
rises abruptly in the wilderness of et-Tih ("the wandering"), mentioned
[Deu 1:19](../kjv/deu001.htm#019), [Deu 1:20](../kjv/deu001.htm#020.md),
"that great and terrible wilderness."
