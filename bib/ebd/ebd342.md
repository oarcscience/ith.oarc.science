<span id="000">**Shunammite**</span> A person of Shunem ([Kg1
1:3](../kjv/kg1001.htm#003); [Kg2 4:12](../kjv/kg2004.htm#012)). The
Syr. and Arab. read "Sulamite."

<span id="001">**Shunem**</span> Two resting-places, a little village in
the tribe of Issachar, to the north of Jezreel and south of Mount Gilboa
([Jos 19:18](../kjv/jos019.htm#018)), where the Philistines encamped
when they came against Saul ([Sa1 28:4](../kjv/sa1028.htm#004)), and
where Elisha was hospitably entertained by a rich woman of the place. On
the sudden death of this woman's son she hastened to Carmel, 20 miles
distant across the plain, to tell Elisha, and to bring him with her to
Shunem. There, in the "prophet's chamber," the dead child lay; and
Elisha entering it, shut the door and prayed earnestly: and the boy was
restored to life (2 Kings 4:8-37). This woman afterwards retired during
the famine to the low land of the Philistines; and on returning a few
years afterwards, found her house and fields in the possession of a
stranger. She appealed to the king at Samaria, and had them in a
somewhat remarkable manner restored to her (compare [Kg2
8:1](../kjv/kg2008.htm#001)).

<span id="002">**Shur**</span> An enclosure; a wall, a part, probably,
of the Arabian desert, on the north-eastern border of Egypt, giving its
name to a wilderness extending from Egypt toward Philistia ([Gen
16:7](../kjv/gen016.htm#007); [Gen 20:1](../kjv/gen020.htm#001); [Gen
25:18](../kjv/gen025.htm#018); [Exo 15:22](../kjv/exo015.htm#022)). The
name was probably given to it from the wall (or shur) which the
Egyptians built to defend their frontier on the north-east from the
desert tribes. This wall or line of fortifications extended from
Pelusium to Heliopolis.

<span id="003">**Shushan**</span> A lily, the Susa of Greek and Roman
writers, once the capital of Elam. It lay in the uplands of Susiana, on
the east of the Tigris, about 150 miles to the north of the head of the
Persian Gulf. It is the modern Shush, on the northwest of Shuster. Once
a magnificent city, it is now an immense mass of ruins. Here Daniel saw
one of his visions (Dan. 8); and here also Nehemiah ([Neh
1:1](../kjv/neh001.htm#001)) began his public life. Most of the events
recorded in the Book of Esther took place here. Modern explorers have
brought to light numerous relics, and the ground-plan of the splendid
palace of Shushan, one of the residences of the great king, together
with numerous specimens of ancient art, which illustrate the statements
of Scripture regarding it ([Dan 8:2](../kjv/dan008.htm#002)). The great
hall of this palace (Esther 1) "consisted of several magnificent groups
of columns, together with a frontage of 343 feet 9 inches, and a depth
of 244 feet. These groups were arranged into a central phalanx of
thirty-six columns (six rows of six each), flanked on the west, north,
and east by an equal number, disposed in double rows of six each, and
distant from them 64 feet 2 inches." The inscriptions on the ruins
represent that the palace was founded by Darius and completed by
Artaxerxes.

<span id="004">**Shushan-Eduth**</span> Lily of the testimony, the title
of [Psa 60:1](../kjv/psa060.htm#001). (See SHOSHANNIM.)

<span id="005">**Sibbecai**</span> The Lord sustains, one of David's
heroes ([Ch1 11:29](../kjv/ch1011.htm#029)), general of the eighth
division of the army ([Ch1 27:11](../kjv/ch1027.htm#011)). He slew the
giant Saph in the battle of Gob ([Sa2 21:18](../kjv/sa2021.htm#018);
R.V., "Sibbechai"). Called also Mebunnai ([Sa2
23:27](../kjv/sa2023.htm#027)).

<span id="006">**Sibmah**</span> Coolness; fragrance, a town in Reuben,
in the territory of Moab, on the east of Jordan ([Jos
13:19](../kjv/jos013.htm#019)); called also Shebam and Shibmah ([Num
32:3](../kjv/num032.htm#003), [Num 32:38](../kjv/num032.htm#038)). It
was famous for its vines ([Isa 16:9](../kjv/isa016.htm#009); [Jer
48:32](../kjv/jer048.htm#032)). It has been identified with the ruin of
Sumieh, where there are rock-cut wine-presses. This fact explains the
words of the prophets referred to above. It was about 5 miles east of
Heshbon.

<span id="007">**Sichem**</span> =Shechem (q.v.), [Gen
12:6](../kjv/gen012.htm#006).

<span id="008">**Sickle**</span> Of the Egyptians resembled that in
modern use. The ears of corn were cut with it near the top of the straw.
There was also a sickle used for warlike purposes, more correctly,
however, called a pruning-hook ([Deu 16:9](../kjv/deu016.htm#009); [Jer
50:16](../kjv/jer050.htm#016), marg., "scythe;" [Joe
3:13](../kjv/joe003.htm#013); [Mar 4:29](../kjv/mar004.htm#029)).

<span id="009">**Siddim, Vale of**</span> Valley of the broad plains,
"which is the salt sea" ([Gen 14:3](../kjv/gen014.htm#003), [Gen
14:8](../kjv/gen014.htm#008), [Gen 14:10](../kjv/gen014.htm#010)),
between Engedi and the cities of the plain, at the south end of the Dead
Sea. It was "full of slime-pits" (R.V., "bitumen pits"). Here
Chedorlaomer and the confederate kings overthrew the kings of Sodom and
the cities of the plain. God afterwards, on account of their wickedness,
"overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of
the cities;" and the smoke of their destruction "went up as the smoke of
a furnace" ([Gen 19:24](../kjv/gen019.htm#024)), and was visible from
Mamre, where Abraham dwelt. Some, however, contend that the "cities of
the plain" were somewhere at the north of the Dead Sea. (See SODOM.)
