<span id="000">**City**</span> The earliest mention of city-building is
that of Enoch, which was built by Cain ([Gen
4:17](../kjv/gen004.htm#017).md). After the confusion of tongues, the
descendants of Nimrod founded several cities ([Gen
10:10](../kjv/gen010.htm#010).md). Next, we have a record of the cities of
the Canaanites, Sidon, Gaza, Sodom, etc. ([Gen
10:12](../kjv/gen010.htm#012), [Gen 10:19](../kjv/gen010.htm#019.md); [Gen
11:3](../kjv/gen011.htm#003), [Gen 11:9](../kjv/gen011.htm#009.md); [Gen
36:31](../kjv/gen036.htm#031).md). The earliest description of a city is
that of Sodom (Gen. 19:1-22). Damascus is said to be the oldest existing
city in the world. Before the time of Abraham there were cities in Egypt
([Num 13:22](../kjv/num013.htm#022).md). The Israelites in Egypt were
employed in building the "treasure cities" of Pithom and Raamses ([Exo
1:11](../kjv/exo001.htm#011).md); but it does not seem that they had any
cities of their own in Goshen ([Gen 46:34](../kjv/gen046.htm#034.md); [Gen
47:1](../kjv/gen047.htm#001).md). In the kingdom of Og in Bashan there were
sixty "great cities with walls," and twenty-three cities in Gilead
partly rebuilt by the tribes on the east of Jordan ([Num
21:21](../kjv/num021.htm#021), [Num 21:32](../kjv/num021.htm#032.md), [Num
21:33](../kjv/num021.htm#033), [Num 21:35](../kjv/num021.htm#035.md); [Num
32:1](../kjv/num032.htm#001), [Num 32:34](../kjv/num032.htm#034.md); [Deu
3:4](../kjv/deu003.htm#004), [Deu 3:5](../kjv/deu003.htm#005.md), [Deu
3:14](../kjv/deu003.htm#014); [Kg1 4:13](../kjv/kg1004.htm#013).md). On the
west of Jordan were thirty-one "royal cities" (Josh. 12), besides many
others spoken of in the history of Israel. A fenced city was a city
surrounded by fortifications and high walls, with watchtowers upon them
([Ch2 11:11](../kjv/ch2011.htm#011); [Deu 3:5](../kjv/deu003.htm#005).md).
There was also within the city generally a tower to which the citizens
might flee when danger threatened them ([Jdg
9:46](../kjv/jdg009.htm#046).md). A city with suburbs was a city surrounded
with open pasture-grounds, such as the forty-eight cities which were
given to the Levites ([Num 35:2](../kjv/num035.htm#002).md). There were six
cities of refuge, three on each side of Jordan, namely, Kadesh, Shechem,
Hebron, on the west of Jordan; and on the east, Bezer, Ramoth-gilead,
and Golan. The cities on each side of the river were nearly opposite
each other. The regulations concerning these cities are given in Num.
35:9-34; [Deu 19:1](../kjv/deu019.htm#001.md); [Exo
21:12](../kjv/exo021.htm#012.md). When David reduced the fortress of the
Jebusites which stood on Mount Zion, he built on the site of it a palace
and a city, which he called by his own name ([Ch1
11:5](../kjv/ch1011.htm#005).md), the city of David. Bethlehem is also so
called as being David's native town ([Luk 2:4](../kjv/luk002.htm#004).md).
Jerusalem is called the Holy City, the holiness of the temple being
regarded as extending in some measure over the whole city ([Neh
11:1](../kjv/neh011.htm#001).md). Pithom and Raamses, built by the
Israelites as "treasure cities," were not places where royal treasures
were kept, but were fortified towns where merchants might store their
goods and transact their business in safety, or cities in which
munitions of war were stored. (See PITHOM.)

<span id="001">**Clauda**</span> A small island off the southwest coast
of Crete, passed by Paul on his voyage to Rome ([Act
27:16](../kjv/act027.htm#016).md). It is about 7 miles long and 3 broad. It
is now called Gozzo (R.V., "Cauda").

<span id="002">**Claudia**</span> A female Christian mentioned in [Ti2
4:21](../kjv/ti2004.htm#021.md). It is a conjecture having some probability
that she was a British maiden, the daughter of king Cogidunus, who was
an ally of Rome, and assumed the name of the emperor, his patron,
Tiberius Claudius, and that she was the wife of Pudens.

<span id="003">**Claudius**</span> Lame. (1.) The fourth Roman emperor.
He succeeded Caligula (A.D. 41). Though in general he treated the Jews,
especially those in Asia and Egypt, with great indulgence, yet about the
middle of his reign (A.D. 49) he banished them all from Rome ([Act
18:2](../kjv/act018.htm#002).md). In this edict the Christians were
included, as being, as was supposed, a sect of Jews. The Jews, however
soon again returned to Rome. During the reign of this emperor, several
persecutions of the Christians by the Jews took place in the dominions
of Herod Agrippa, in one of which the apostle James was "killed" ([Act
12:2](../kjv/act012.htm#002)). He died A.D. 54. (2..md) Claudius Lysias, a
Greek who, having obtained by purchase the privilege of Roman
citizenship, took the name of Claudius ([Act
21:31](../kjv/act021.htm#031); [Act 22:28](../kjv/act022.htm#028.md); [Act
23:26](../kjv/act023.htm#026).md).

<span id="004">**Clay**</span> This word is used of sediment found in
pits or in streets ([Isa 57:20](../kjv/isa057.htm#020.md); [Jer
38:6](../kjv/jer038.htm#006).md), of dust mixed with spittle ([Joh
9:6](../kjv/joh009.htm#006).md), and of potter's clay ([Isa
41:25](../kjv/isa041.htm#025); [Nah 3:14](../kjv/nah003.htm#014.md); [Jer
18:1](../kjv/jer018.htm#001); [Rom 9:21](../kjv/rom009.htm#021).md). Clay
was used for sealing ([Job 38:14](../kjv/job038.htm#014.md); [Jer
32:14](../kjv/jer032.htm#014).md). Our Lord's tomb may have been thus
sealed ([Mat 27:66](../kjv/mat027.htm#066).md). The practice of sealing
doors with clay is still common in the East. Clay was also in primitive
times used for mortar ([Gen 11:3](../kjv/gen011.htm#003).md). The "clay
ground" in which the large vessels of the temple were cast ([Kg1
7:46](../kjv/kg1007.htm#046); [Ch2 4:17](../kjv/ch2004.htm#017).md) was a
compact loam fitted for the purpose. The expression literally rendered
is, "in the thickness of the ground,", meaning, "in stiff ground" or in
clay.

<span id="005">**Clean**</span> The various forms of uncleanness
according to the Mosaic law are enumerated in Lev. 11-15; Num. 19. The
division of animals into clean and unclean was probably founded on the
practice of sacrifice. It existed before the Flood ([Gen
7:2](../kjv/gen007.htm#002).md). The regulations regarding such animals are
recorded in Lev. 11 and Deut. 14:1-21. The Hebrews were prohibited from
using as food certain animal substances, such as (1.) blood; (2.) the
fat covering the intestines, termed the caul; (3.) the fat on the
intestines, called the mesentery; (4.) the fat of the kidneys; and (5.)
the fat tail of certain sheep ([Exo 29:13](../kjv/exo029.htm#013.md), [Exo
29:22](../kjv/exo029.htm#022); [Lev 3:4](../kjv/lev003.htm#004.md); [Lev
9:19](../kjv/lev009.htm#019); [Lev 17:10](../kjv/lev017.htm#010.md); [Lev
19:26](../kjv/lev019.htm#026).md). The chief design of these regulations
seems to have been to establish a system of regimen which would
distinguish the Jews from all other nations. Regarding the design and
the abolition of these regulations the reader will find all the details
in [Lev 20:24](../kjv/lev020.htm#024.md); [Act
10:9](../kjv/act010.htm#009); [Act 11:1](../kjv/act011.htm#001.md); [Heb
9:9](../kjv/heb009.htm#009.md).

<span id="006">**Clement**</span> Mild, a Christian of Philippi, Paul's
"fellow-labourer," whose name he mentions as "in the book of life" ([Phi
4:3](../kjv/phi004.htm#003).md). It was an opinion of ancient writers that
he was the Clement of Rome whose name is well known in church history,
and that he was the author of an Epistle to the Corinthians, the only
known manuscript of which is appended to the Alexandrian Codex, now in
the British Museum. It is of some historical interest, and has given
rise to much discussion among critics. It makes distinct reference to
Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians.

<span id="007">**Cleopas**</span> (abbreviation of Cleopatros), one of
the two disciples with whom Jesus conversed on the way to Emmaus on the
day of the resurrection ([Luk 24:18](../kjv/luk024.htm#018).md). We know
nothing definitely regarding him. It is not certain that he was the
Clopas of [Joh 19:25](../kjv/joh019.htm#025.md), or the Alphaeus of [Mat
10:3](../kjv/mat010.htm#003.md), although he may have been so.

<span id="008">**Cleophas**</span> (in the spelling of this word h is
inserted by mistake from Latin MSS.), rather Cleopas, which is the Greek
form of the word, while Clopas is the Aramaic form. In [Joh
19:25](../kjv/joh019.htm#025.md) the Authorized Version reads, "Mary, the
wife of Clopas." The word "wife" is conjecturally inserted here. If
"wife" is rightly inserted, then Mary was the mother of James the Less,
and Clopas is the same as Alphaeus ([Mat 10:3](../kjv/mat010.htm#003.md);
[Mat 27:56](../kjv/mat027.htm#056).md).

<span id="009">**Cloak**</span> An upper garment, "an exterior tunic,
wide and long, reaching to the ankles, but without sleeves" ([Isa
59:17](../kjv/isa059.htm#017).md). The word so rendered is elsewhere
rendered "robe" or "mantle." It was worn by the high priest under the
ephod ([Exo 28:31](../kjv/exo028.htm#031).md), by kings and others of rank
([Sa1 15:27](../kjv/sa1015.htm#027); [Job 1:20](../kjv/job001.htm#020.md);
[Job 2:12](../kjv/job002.htm#012).md), and by women ([Sa2
13:18](../kjv/sa2013.htm#018).md). The word translated "cloke", i.e., outer
garment, in [Mat 5:40](../kjv/mat005.htm#040.md) is in its plural form used
of garments in general ([Mat 17:2](../kjv/mat017.htm#002.md); [Mat
26:65](../kjv/mat026.htm#065).md). The cloak mentioned here and in [Luk
6:29](../kjv/luk006.htm#029.md) was the Greek himation , Latin pallium ,
and consisted of a large square piece of wollen cloth fastened round the
shoulders, like the abba of the Arabs. This could be taken by a creditor
([Exo 22:26](../kjv/exo022.htm#026.md), [Exo
22:27](../kjv/exo022.htm#027)), but the coat or tunic (Gr. chiton .md)
mentioned in [Mat 5:40](../kjv/mat005.htm#040.md) could not. The cloak
which Paul "left at Troas" ([Ti2 4:13](../kjv/ti2004.htm#013).md) was the
Roman poenula, a thick upper garment used chiefly in travelling as a
protection from the weather. Some, however, have supposed that what Paul
meant was a travelling-bag. In the Syriac version the word used means a
bookcase. (See DRESS.)
