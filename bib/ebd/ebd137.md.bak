<span id="000">**Forces**</span> Of the Gentiles ([Isa
60:5](../kjv/isa060.htm#005), [Isa 60:11](../kjv/isa060.htm#011.md); R.V.,
"the wealth of the nations") denotes the wealth of the heathen. The
whole passage means that the wealth of the Gentile world should be
consecrated to the service of the church.

<span id="001">**Ford**</span> Mention is frequently made of the fords
of the Jordan ([Jos 2:7](../kjv/jos002.htm#007.md); [Jdg
3:28](../kjv/jdg003.htm#028); [Jdg 12:5](../kjv/jdg012.htm#005.md), [Jdg
12:6](../kjv/jdg012.htm#006).md), which must have been very numerous; about
fifty perhaps. The most notable was that of Bethabara. Mention is also
made of the ford of the Jabbok ([Gen 32:22](../kjv/gen032.htm#022).md), and
of the fords of Arnon ([Isa 16:2](../kjv/isa016.htm#002).md) and of the
Euphrates ([Jer 51:32](../kjv/jer051.htm#032).md).

<span id="002">**Forehead**</span> The practice common among Oriental
nations of colouring the forehead or impressing on it some distinctive
mark as a sign of devotion to some deity is alluded to in [Rev
13:16](../kjv/rev013.htm#016), [Rev 13:17](../kjv/rev013.htm#017.md); [Rev
14:9](../kjv/rev014.htm#009); [Rev 17:5](../kjv/rev017.htm#005.md); [Rev
20:4](../kjv/rev020.htm#004.md). The "jewel on thy forehead" mentioned in
[Eze 16:12](../kjv/eze016.htm#012) (R.V., "a ring upon thy nose".md) was in
all probability the "nose-ring" ([Isa 3:21](../kjv/isa003.htm#021).md). In
[Eze 3:7](../kjv/eze003.htm#007.md) the word "impudent" is rightly rendered
in the Revised Version "an hard forehead." (See also [Eze
3:8](../kjv/eze003.htm#008), [Eze 3:9](../kjv/eze003.htm#009)..md)

<span id="003">**Foreigner**</span> A Gentile. Such as resided among the
Hebrews were required by the law to be treated with kindness ([Exo
22:21](../kjv/exo022.htm#021); [Exo 23:9](../kjv/exo023.htm#009.md); [Lev
19:33](../kjv/lev019.htm#033), [Lev 19:34](../kjv/lev019.htm#034.md); [Lev
23:22](../kjv/lev023.htm#022); [Deu 14:28](../kjv/deu014.htm#028.md); [Deu
16:10](../kjv/deu016.htm#010), [Deu 16:11](../kjv/deu016.htm#011.md); [Deu
24:19](../kjv/deu024.htm#019).md). They enjoyed in many things equal rights
with the native-born residents ([Exo 12:49](../kjv/exo012.htm#049.md); [Lev
24:22](../kjv/lev024.htm#022); [Num 15:15](../kjv/num015.htm#015.md); [Num
35:15](../kjv/num035.htm#015).md), but were not allowed to do anything
which was an abomination according to the Jewish law ([Exo
20:10](../kjv/exo020.htm#010); [Lev 17:15](../kjv/lev017.htm#015.md), [Lev
17:16](../kjv/lev017.htm#016); [Lev 18:26](../kjv/lev018.htm#026.md); [Lev
20:2](../kjv/lev020.htm#002); [Lev 24:16](../kjv/lev024.htm#016), etc..md).

<span id="004">**Foreknowledge of God**</span> [Act
2:23](../kjv/act002.htm#023); [Rom 8:29](../kjv/rom008.htm#029.md); [Rom
11:2](../kjv/rom011.htm#002); [Pe1 1:2](../kjv/pe1001.htm#002).md), one of
those high attributes essentially appertaining to him the full import of
which we cannot comprehend. In the most absolute sense his knowledge is
infinite ([Sa1 23:9](../kjv/sa1023.htm#009.md); [Jer
38:17](../kjv/jer038.htm#017); [Jer 42:9](../kjv/jer042.htm#009.md), [Mat
11:21](../kjv/mat011.htm#021), [Mat 11:23](../kjv/mat011.htm#023.md); [Act
15:18](../kjv/act015.htm#018).md).

<span id="005">**Forerunner**</span> John the Baptist went before our
Lord in this character ([Mar 1:2](../kjv/mar001.htm#002.md), [Mar
1:3](../kjv/mar001.htm#003).md). Christ so called ([Heb
6:20](../kjv/heb006.htm#020).md) as entering before his people into the
holy place as their head and guide.

<span id="006">**Forest**</span> Heb. ya'ar , meaning a dense wood, from
its luxuriance. Thus all the great primeval forests of Syria ([Ecc
2:6](../kjv/ecc002.htm#006); [Isa 44:14](../kjv/isa044.htm#014.md); [Jer
5:6](../kjv/jer005.htm#006); [Mic 5:8](../kjv/mic005.htm#008).md). The most
extensive was the trans-Jordanic forest of Ephraim ([Sa2
18:6](../kjv/sa2018.htm#006), [Sa2 18:8](../kjv/sa2018.htm#008.md); [Jos
17:15](../kjv/jos017.htm#015), [Jos 17:18](../kjv/jos017.htm#018).md),
which is probably the same as the wood of Ephratah ([Psa
132:6](../kjv/psa132.htm#006).md), some part of the great forest of Gilead.
It was in this forest that Absalom was slain by Joab. David withdrew to
the forest of Hareth in the mountains of Judah to avoid the fury of Saul
([Sa1 22:5](../kjv/sa1022.htm#005).md). We read also of the forest of
Bethel ([Kg2 2:23](../kjv/kg2002.htm#023.md), [Kg2
2:24](../kjv/kg2002.htm#024).md), and of that which the Israelites passed
in their pursuit of the Philistines ([Sa1
14:25](../kjv/sa1014.htm#025).md), and of the forest of the cedars of
Lebanon ([Kg1 4:33](../kjv/kg1004.htm#033.md); [Kg2
19:23](../kjv/kg2019.htm#023); [Hos 14:5](../kjv/hos014.htm#005.md), [Hos
14:6](../kjv/hos014.htm#006).md). "The house of the forest of Lebanon ([Kg1
7:2](../kjv/kg1007.htm#002); [Kg1 10:17](../kjv/kg1010.htm#017.md); [Ch2
9:16](../kjv/ch2009.htm#016).md) was probably Solomon's armoury, and was so
called because the wood of its many pillars came from Lebanon, and they
had the appearance of a forest. (See BAALBEC.) Heb. horesh , denoting a
thicket of trees, underwood, jungle, bushes, or trees entangled, and
therefore affording a safe hiding-place. place. This word is rendered
"forest" only in [Ch2 27:4](../kjv/ch2027.htm#004.md). It is also rendered
"wood", the "wood" in the "wilderness of Ziph," in which david concealed
himself ([Sa1 23:15](../kjv/sa1023.htm#015).md), which lay south-east of
Hebron. In [Isa 17:9](../kjv/isa017.htm#009.md) this word is in Authorized
Version rendered incorrectly "bough." Heb. pardes , meaning an enclosed
garden or plantation. Asaph is ([Neh 2:8](../kjv/neh002.htm#008).md) called
the "keeper of the king's forest." The same Hebrew word is used [Ecc
2:5](../kjv/ecc002.htm#005.md), where it is rendered in the plural
"orchards" (R.V., "parks"), and [Sol 4:13](../kjv/sol004.htm#013.md),
rendered "orchard" (R.V. marg., "a paradise"). "The forest of the
vintage" ([Zac 11:2](../kjv/zac011.htm#002.md), "inaccessible forest," or
R.V. "strong forest") is probably a figurative allusion to Jerusalem, or
the verse may simply point to the devastation of the region referred to.
The forest is an image of unfruitfulness as contrasted with a cultivated
field ([Isa 29:17](../kjv/isa029.htm#017.md); [Isa
32:15](../kjv/isa032.htm#015); [Jer 26:18](../kjv/jer026.htm#018.md); [Hos
2:12](../kjv/hos002.htm#012).md). Isaiah ([Isa
10:19](../kjv/isa010.htm#019), [Isa 10:33](../kjv/isa010.htm#033.md), [Isa
10:34](../kjv/isa010.htm#034).md) likens the Assyrian host under
Sennacherib (q.v.) to the trees of some huge forest, to be suddenly cut
down by an unseen stroke.

<span id="007">**Forgiveness of Sin**</span> One of the constituent
parts of justification. In pardoning sin, God absolves the sinner from
the condemnation of the law, and that on account of the work of Christ,
i.e., he removes the guilt of sin, or the sinner's actual liability to
eternal wrath on account of it. All sins are forgiven freely ([Act
5:31](../kjv/act005.htm#031); [Act 13:38](../kjv/act013.htm#038.md); [Jo1
1:6](../kjv/jo1001.htm#006).md). The sinner is by this act of grace for
ever freed from the guilt and penalty of his sins. This is the peculiar
prerogative of God ([Psa 130:4](../kjv/psa130.htm#004.md); [Mar
2:5](../kjv/mar002.htm#005).md). It is offered to all in the gospel. (See
JUSTIFICATION.)

<span id="008">**Fornication**</span> In every form of it was sternly
condemned by the Mosaic law ([Lev 21:9](../kjv/lev021.htm#009.md); [Lev
19:29](../kjv/lev019.htm#029); [Deu 22:20](../kjv/deu022.htm#020.md), [Deu
22:21](../kjv/deu022.htm#021), [Deu 22:23](../kjv/deu022.htm#023.md); [Deu
23:18](../kjv/deu023.htm#018); [Exo 22:16](../kjv/exo022.htm#016).md). (See
ADULTERY.) But this word is more frequently used in a symbolical than in
its ordinary sense. It frequently means a forsaking of God or a
following after idols ([Isa 1:2](../kjv/isa001.htm#002.md); [Jer
2:20](../kjv/jer002.htm#020.md); Ezek. 16; [Hos
1:2](../kjv/hos001.htm#002); [Hos 2:1](../kjv/hos002.htm#001.md); [Jer
3:8](../kjv/jer003.htm#008), [Jer 3:9](../kjv/jer003.htm#009).md).

<span id="009">**Fortunatus**</span> Fortunate, a disciple of Corinth
who visited Paul at Ephesus, and returned with Stephanas and Achaicus,
the bearers of the apostle's first letter to the Corinthians ([Co1
16:17](../kjv/co1016.htm#017).md).
