<span id="000">**Apharsachites**</span> A company of the colonists whom
the Assyrian king planted in Samaria ([Ezr 5:6](../kjv/ezr005.htm#006.md);
[Ezr 6:6](../kjv/ezr006.htm#006).md).

<span id="001">**Apharsites**</span> Another of the tribes removed to
Samaria ([Ezr 4:9](../kjv/ezr004.htm#009).md), or perhaps the same as the
preceding.

<span id="002">**Aphik**</span> ([Jdg 1:31](../kjv/jdg001.htm#031).md);
Aphek ([Jos 13:4](../kjv/jos013.htm#004.md); [Jos
19:30](../kjv/jos019.htm#030)), stronghold. (1..md) A city of the tribe of
Asher. It was the scene of the licentious worship of the Syrian
Aphrodite. The ruins of the temple, "magnificent ruins" in a "spot of
strange wildness and beauty", are still seen at Afka, on the north-west
slopes of Lebanon, near the source of the river Adonis (now Nahr
Ibrahim), 12 miles east of Gebal. (2.) A city of the tribe of Issachar,
near to Jezreel ([Sa1 4:1](../kjv/sa1004.htm#001.md); [Sa1
29:1](../kjv/sa1029.htm#001.md); compare [Sa1
28:4](../kjv/sa1028.htm#004)). (3..md)A town on the road from Damascus to
Palestine, in the level plain east of Jordan, near which Benhadad was
defeated by the Israelites ([Kg1 20:26](../kjv/kg1020.htm#026.md), [Kg1
20:30](../kjv/kg1020.htm#030); [Kg2 13:17](../kjv/kg2013.htm#017).md). It
has been identified with the modern Fik, 6 miles east of the Sea of
Galilee, opposite Tiberias.

<span id="003">**Apocalypse**</span> The Greek name of the Book of
Revelation (q.v.).

<span id="004">**Apocrypha**</span> Hidden, spurious, the name given to
certain ancient books which found a place in the LXX. and Latin Vulgate
versions of the Old Testament, and were appended to all the great
translations made from them in the sixteenth century, but which have no
claim to be regarded as in any sense parts of the inspired Word. (1.)
They are not once quoted by the New Testament writers, who frequently
quote from the LXX. Our Lord and his apostles confirmed by their
authority the ordinary Jewish canon, which was the same in all respects
as we now have it. (2.) These books were written not in Hebrew but in
Greek, and during the "period of silence," from the time of Malachi,
after which oracles and direct revelations from God ceased till the
Christian era. (3.) The contents of the books themselves show that they
were no part of Scripture. The Old Testament Apocrypha consists of
fourteen books, the chief of which are the Books of the Maccabees
(q.v.), the Books of Esdras, the Book of Wisdom, the Book of Baruch, the
Book of Esther, Ecclesiasticus, Tobit, Judith, etc. The New Testament
Apocrypha consists of a very extensive literature, which bears distinct
evidences of its non-apostolic origin, and is utterly unworthy of
regard.

<span id="005">**Apollonia**</span> A city of Macedonia between
Amphipolis and Thessalonica, from which it was distant about 36 miles.
Paul and Silas passed through it on their way to Thessalonica ([Act
17:1](../kjv/act017.htm#001).md).

<span id="006">**Apollos**</span> A Jew "born at Alexandria," a man well
versed in the Scriptures and eloquent ([Act
18:24](../kjv/act018.htm#024); R.V., "learned".md). He came to Ephesus
(about A.D. 49), where he spake "boldly" in the synagogue ([Act
18:26](../kjv/act018.htm#026).md), although he did not know as yet that
Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah. Aquila and Priscilla instructed him
more perfectly in "the way of God", i.e., in the knowledge of Christ. He
then proceeded to Corinth, where he met Paul ([Act
18:27](../kjv/act018.htm#027); [Act 19:1](../kjv/act019.htm#001).md). He
was there very useful in watering the good seed Paul had sown ([Co1
1:12](../kjv/co1001.htm#012).md), and in gaining many to Christ. His
disciples were much attached to him ([Co1 3:4](../kjv/co1003.htm#004.md),
[Co1 3:22](../kjv/co1003.htm#022).md). He was with Paul at Ephesus when he
wrote the First Epistle to the Corinthians; and Paul makes kindly
reference to him in his letter to Titus ([Tit
3:13](../kjv/tit003.htm#013).md). Some have supposed, although without
sufficient ground, that he was the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews.

<span id="007">**Apollyon**</span> Destroyer, the name given to the king
of the hosts represented by the locusts ([Rev
9:11](../kjv/rev009.htm#011).md). It is the Greek translation of the Hebrew
Abaddon (q.v.).

<span id="008">**Apostle**</span> A person sent by another; a messenger;
envoy. This word is once used as a descriptive designation of Jesus
Christ, the Sent of the Father ([Heb 3:1](../kjv/heb003.htm#001.md); [Joh
20:21](../kjv/joh020.htm#021).md). It is, however, generally used as
designating the body of disciples to whom he entrusted the organization
of his church and the dissemination of his gospel, "the twelve," as they
are called ([Mat 10:1](../kjv/mat010.htm#001.md); [Mar
3:14](../kjv/mar003.htm#014); [Mar 6:7](../kjv/mar006.htm#007.md); [Luk
6:13](../kjv/luk006.htm#013); [Luk 9:1](../kjv/luk009.htm#001).md). We have
four lists of the apostles, one by each of the synoptic evangelists
([Mat 10:2](../kjv/mat010.htm#002); [Mar 3:16](../kjv/mar003.htm#016.md);
[Luk 6:14](../kjv/luk006.htm#014).md), and one in the Acts ([Act
1:13](../kjv/act001.htm#013).md). No two of these lists, however, perfectly
coincide. Our Lord gave them the "keys of the kingdom," and by the gift
of his Spirit fitted them to be the founders and governors of his church
([Joh 14:16](../kjv/joh014.htm#016), [Joh 14:17](../kjv/joh014.htm#017.md),
[Joh 14:26](../kjv/joh014.htm#026); [Joh 15:26](../kjv/joh015.htm#026.md),
[Joh 15:27](../kjv/joh015.htm#027); [Joh 16:7](../kjv/joh016.htm#007).md).
To them, as representing his church, he gave the commission to "preach
the gospel to every creature" ([Mat 28:18](../kjv/mat028.htm#018).md).
After his ascension he communicated to them, according to his promise,
supernatural gifts to qualify them for the discharge of their duties
([Act 2:4](../kjv/act002.htm#004); [Co1 2:16](../kjv/co1002.htm#016.md);
[Co1 2:7](../kjv/co1002.htm#007), [Co1 2:10](../kjv/co1002.htm#010.md),
[Co1 2:13](../kjv/co1002.htm#013); [Co2 5:20](../kjv/co2005.htm#020.md);
[Co1 11:2](../kjv/co1011.htm#002).md). Judas Iscariot, one of "the twelve,"
fell by transgression, and Matthias was substituted in his place ([Act
1:21](../kjv/act001.htm#021).md). Saul of Tarsus was afterwards added to
their number (Acts 9:3-20; [Act 20:4](../kjv/act020.htm#004.md); [Act
26:15](../kjv/act026.htm#015); [Ti1 1:12](../kjv/ti1001.htm#012.md); [Ti1
2:7](../kjv/ti1002.htm#007); [Ti2 1:11](../kjv/ti2001.htm#011).md). Luke
has given some account of Peter, John, and the two Jameses ([Act
12:2](../kjv/act012.htm#002), [Act 12:17](../kjv/act012.htm#017.md); [Act
15:13](../kjv/act015.htm#013); [Act 21:18](../kjv/act021.htm#018).md), but
beyond this we know nothing from authentic history of the rest of the
original twelve. After the martyrdom of James the Greater ([Act
12:2](../kjv/act012.htm#002).md), James the Less usually resided at
Jerusalem, while Paul, "the apostle of the uncircumcision," usually
traveled as a missionary among the Gentiles ([Gal
2:8](../kjv/gal002.htm#008).md). It was characteristic of the apostles and
necessary (1.) that they should have seen the Lord, and been able to
testify of him and of his resurrection from personal knowledge ([Joh
15:27](../kjv/joh015.htm#027); [Act 1:21](../kjv/act001.htm#021.md), [Act
1:22](../kjv/act001.htm#022); [Co1 9:1](../kjv/co1009.htm#001.md); [Act
22:14](../kjv/act022.htm#014), [Act 22:15](../kjv/act022.htm#015)). (2..md)
They must have been immediately called to that office by Christ ([Luk
6:13](../kjv/luk006.htm#013); [Gal 1:1](../kjv/gal001.htm#001)). (3..md) It
was essential that they should be infallibly inspired, and thus secured
against all error and mistake in their public teaching, whether by word
or by writing ([Joh 14:26](../kjv/joh014.htm#026.md); [Joh
16:13](../kjv/joh016.htm#013); [Th1 2:13](../kjv/th1002.htm#013)). (4..md)
Another qualification was the power of working miracles ([Mar
16:20](../kjv/mar016.htm#020); [Act 2:43](../kjv/act002.htm#043.md); [Co1
12:8](../kjv/co1012.htm#008).md). The apostles therefore could have had no
successors. They are the only authoritative teachers of the Christian
doctrines. The office of an apostle ceased with its first holders. In
[Co2 8:23](../kjv/co2008.htm#023) and [Phi 2:25](../kjv/phi002.htm#025.md)
the word "messenger" is the rendering of the same Greek word, elsewhere
rendered "apostle."

<span id="009">**Apothecary**</span> Rendered in the margin and the
Revised Version "perfumer," in [Exo 30:25](../kjv/exo030.htm#025.md); [Exo
37:29](../kjv/exo037.htm#029); [Ecc 10:1](../kjv/ecc010.htm#001.md). The
holy oils and ointments were prepared by priests properly qualified for
this office. The feminine plural form of the Hebrew word is rendered
"confectioneries" in [Sa1 8:13](../kjv/sa1008.htm#013.md).
