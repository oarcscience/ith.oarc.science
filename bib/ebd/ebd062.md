<span id="000">**Bolster**</span> The Hebrew word kebir, rendered
"pillow" in [Sa1 19:13](../kjv/sa1019.htm#013), [Sa1
19:16](../kjv/sa1019.htm#016), but in Revised Version marg. "quilt" or
"network," probably means some counterpane or veil intended to protect
the head of the sleeper. A different Hebrew word ( meraashoth' ) is used
for "bolster" ([Sa1 26:7](../kjv/sa1026.htm#007), [Sa1
26:11](../kjv/sa1026.htm#011), [Sa1 26:16](../kjv/sa1026.htm#016)). It
is rightly rendered in Revised Version "at his head." In [Gen
28:11](../kjv/gen028.htm#011), [Gen 28:18](../kjv/gen028.htm#018) the
Authorized Version renders it "for his pillows," and the Revised Version
"under his head." In [Eze 13:18](../kjv/eze013.htm#018), [Eze
13:20](../kjv/eze013.htm#020) another Hebrew word (kesathoth) is used,
properly denoting "cushions" or "pillows," as so rendered both in the
Authorized and the Revised Version.

<span id="001">**Bond**</span> An obligation of any kind ([Num
30:2](../kjv/num030.htm#002), [Num 30:4](../kjv/num030.htm#004), [Num
30:12](../kjv/num030.htm#012)). The word means also oppression or
affliction ([Psa 116:16](../kjv/psa116.htm#016); [Phi
1:7](../kjv/phi001.htm#007)). Christian love is the "bond of
perfectness" ([Col 3:14](../kjv/col003.htm#014)), and the influences of
the Spirit are the "bond of peace" ([Eph 4:3](../kjv/eph004.htm#003)).

<span id="002">**Bondage**</span> Of Israel in Egypt ([Exo
2:23](../kjv/exo002.htm#023), [Exo 2:25](../kjv/exo002.htm#025); 5),
which is called the "house of bondage" ([Exo
13:3](../kjv/exo013.htm#003); [Exo 20:2](../kjv/exo020.htm#002)). This
word is used also with reference to the captivity in Babylon ([Isa
14:3](../kjv/isa014.htm#003)), and the oppression of the Persian king
([Ezr 9:8](../kjv/ezr009.htm#008), [Ezr 9:9](../kjv/ezr009.htm#009)).

<span id="003">**Bonnet**</span> (Heb. peer ), [Exo
39:28](../kjv/exo039.htm#028) (R.V., "head-tires"); [Eze
44:18](../kjv/eze044.htm#018) (R.V., "tires"), denotes properly a turban
worn by priests, and in [Isa 3:20](../kjv/isa003.htm#020) (R.V.,
"head-tires") a head-dress or tiara worn by females. The Hebrew word so
rendered literally means an ornament, as in [Isa
61:10](../kjv/isa061.htm#010) (R.V., "garland"), and in [Eze
24:17](../kjv/eze024.htm#017), [Eze 24:23](../kjv/eze024.htm#023) "tire"
(R.V., "head-tire"). It consisted of a piece of cloth twisted about the
head. In [Exo 28:40](../kjv/exo028.htm#040); [Exo
29:9](../kjv/exo029.htm#009) it is the translation of a different Hebrew
word ( migba'ah ), which denotes the turban (R.V., "head-tire") of the
common priest as distinguished from the mitre of the high priest. (See
MITRE.)

<span id="004">**Book**</span> This word has a comprehensive meaning in
Scripture. In the Old Testament it is the rendering of the Hebrew word
sepher, which properly means a "writing," and then a "volume" ([Exo
17:14](../kjv/exo017.htm#014); [Deu 28:58](../kjv/deu028.htm#058); [Deu
29:20](../kjv/deu029.htm#020); [Job 19:23](../kjv/job019.htm#023)) or
"roll of a book" ([Jer 36:2](../kjv/jer036.htm#002), [Jer
36:4](../kjv/jer036.htm#004)). Books were originally written on skins,
on linen or cotton cloth, and on Egyptian papyrus, whence our word
"paper." The leaves of the book were generally written in columns,
designated by a Hebrew word properly meaning "doors" and "valves" ([Jer
36:23](../kjv/jer036.htm#023), R.V., marg. "columns"). Among the Hebrews
books were generally rolled up like our maps, or if very long they were
rolled from both ends, forming two rolls ([Luk
4:17](../kjv/luk004.htm#017)). Thus they were arranged when the writing
was on flexible materials; but if the writing was on tablets of wood or
brass or lead, then the several tablets were bound together by rings
through which a rod was passed. A sealed book is one whose contents are
secret ([Isa 29:11](../kjv/isa029.htm#011); [Rev
5:1](../kjv/rev005.htm#001)). To "eat" a book ([Jer
15:16](../kjv/jer015.htm#016); [Eze 2:8](../kjv/eze002.htm#008); [Eze
3:1](../kjv/eze003.htm#001); [Rev 10:9](../kjv/rev010.htm#009)) is to
study its contents carefully. The book of judgment ([Dan
7:10](../kjv/dan007.htm#010)) refers to the method of human courts of
justice as illustrating the proceedings which will take place at the day
of God's final judgment. The book of the wars of the Lord ([Num
21:14](../kjv/num021.htm#014)), the book of Jasher ([Jos
10:13](../kjv/jos010.htm#013)), and the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Judah and Israel ([Ch2 25:26](../kjv/ch2025.htm#026)), were
probably ancient documents known to the Hebrews, but not forming a part
of the canon. The book of life ([Psa 69:28](../kjv/psa069.htm#028))
suggests the idea that as the redeemed form a community or citizenship
([Phi 3:20](../kjv/phi003.htm#020); [Phi 4:3](../kjv/phi004.htm#003)), a
catalogue of the citizens' names is preserved ([Luk
10:20](../kjv/luk010.htm#020); [Rev 20:15](../kjv/rev020.htm#015)).
Their names are registered in heaven ([Luk
10:20](../kjv/luk010.htm#020); [Rev 3:5](../kjv/rev003.htm#005)). The
book of the covenant ([Exo 24:7](../kjv/exo024.htm#007)), containing Ex.
20:22-23:33, is the first book actually mentioned as a part of the
written word. It contains a series of laws, civil, social, and
religious, given to Moses at Sinai immediately after the delivery of the
decalogue. These were written in this "book."

<span id="005">**Booth**</span> A hut made of the branches of a tree. In
such tabernacles Jacob sojourned for a season at a place named from this
circumstance Succoth ([Gen 33:17](../kjv/gen033.htm#017)). Booths were
erected also at the feast of Tabernacles (q.v.), [Lev
23:42](../kjv/lev023.htm#042), [Lev 23:43](../kjv/lev023.htm#043), which
commemorated the abode of the Israelites in the wilderness.

<span id="006">**Booty**</span> Captives or cattle or objects of value
taken in war. In Canaan all that breathed were to be destroyed ([Deu
20:16](../kjv/deu020.htm#016)). The "pictures and images" of the
Canaanites were to be destroyed also ([Num
33:52](../kjv/num033.htm#052)). The law of booty as to its division is
laid down in Num. 31:26-47. David afterwards introduced a regulation
that the baggage-guard should share the booty equally with the soldiers
engaged in battle. He also devoted of the spoils of war for the temple
([Sa1 30:24](../kjv/sa1030.htm#024); [Sa2 8:11](../kjv/sa2008.htm#011);
[Ch1 26:27](../kjv/ch1026.htm#027)).

<span id="007">**Borrow**</span> The Israelites "borrowed" from the
Egyptians ([Exo 12:35](../kjv/exo012.htm#035), R.V., "asked") in
accordance with a divine command ([Exo 3:22](../kjv/exo003.htm#022);
[Exo 11:2](../kjv/exo011.htm#002)). But the word ( sha'al ) so rendered
here means simply and always to "request" or "demand." The Hebrew had
another word which is properly translated "borrow" in [Deu
28:12](../kjv/deu028.htm#012); [Psa 37:21](../kjv/psa037.htm#021). It
was well known that the parting was final. The Egyptians were so anxious
to get the Israelites away out of their land that "they let them have
what they asked" ([Exo 12:36](../kjv/exo012.htm#036), R.V.), or
literally "made them to ask," urged them to take whatever they desired
and depart. (See LOAN.)

<span id="008">**Bosom**</span> In the East objects are carried in the
bosom which Europeans carry in the pocket. To have in one's bosom
indicates kindness, secrecy, or intimacy ([Gen
16:5](../kjv/gen016.htm#005); [Sa2 12:8](../kjv/sa2012.htm#008)). Christ
is said to have been in "the bosom of the Father," i.e., he had the most
perfect knowledge of the Father, had the closest intimacy with him ([Joh
1:18](../kjv/joh001.htm#018)). John ([Joh 13:23](../kjv/joh013.htm#023))
was "leaning on Jesus' bosom" at the last supper. Our Lord carries his
lambs in his bosom, i.e., has a tender, watchful care over them ([Isa
40:11](../kjv/isa040.htm#011)).

<span id="009">**Bosses**</span> The projecting parts of a shield ([Job
15:26](../kjv/job015.htm#026)). The Hebrew word thus rendered means
anything convex or arched, and hence the back, as of animals.
