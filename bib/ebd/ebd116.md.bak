<span id="000">**Eliakim**</span> Whom God will raise up. (1.) The son
of Melea ([Luk 3:30](../kjv/luk003.htm#030).md), and probably grandson of
Nathan. (2.) The son of Abiud, of the posterity of Zerubbabel ([Mat
1:13](../kjv/mat001.htm#013)). (3..md) The son of Hilkiah, who was sent to
receive the message of the invading Assyrians and report it to Isaiah
([Kg2 18:18](../kjv/kg2018.htm#018); [Kg2 19:2](../kjv/kg2019.htm#002.md);
[Isa 36:3](../kjv/isa036.htm#003); [Isa 37:2](../kjv/isa037.htm#002).md).
In his office as governor of the palace of Hezekiah he succeeded Shebna
([Isa 22:15](../kjv/isa022.htm#015).md). He was a good man ([Isa
22:20](../kjv/isa022.htm#020); [Kg2 18:37](../kjv/kg2018.htm#037).md), and
had a splendid and honourable career. (4.) The original name of
Jehoiakim, king of Judah ([Kg2 23:34](../kjv/kg2023.htm#034).md). He was
the son of Josiah.

<span id="001">**Eliam**</span> God's people. (1.) The father of
Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah ([Sa2 11:3](../kjv/sa2011.htm#003).md). In
[Ch1 3:5](../kjv/ch1003.htm#005) his name is Ammiel. (2..md) This name also
occurs as that of a Gilonite, the son of Ahithophel, and one of David's
thirty warriors ([Sa2 23:34](../kjv/sa2023.htm#034).md). perhaps these two
were the same person.

<span id="002">**Elias**</span> The Greek form of Elijah ([Mat
11:14](../kjv/mat011.htm#014); [Mat 16:14](../kjv/mat016.htm#014.md),
etc.), which the Revised Version has uniformly adopted in the New
Testament. (See ELIJAH.)

<span id="003">**Eliashib**</span> Whom God will restore. (1.) A priest,
head of one of the courses of the priests of the time of David ([Ch1
24:12](../kjv/ch1024.htm#012)). (2..md) A high priest in the time of Ezra
and Nehemiah ([Neh 12:22](../kjv/neh012.htm#022.md), [Neh
12:23](../kjv/neh012.htm#023).md). He rebuilt the eastern city wall ([Neh
3:1](../kjv/neh003.htm#001).md), his own mansion being in that quarter, on
the ridge Ophel ([Neh 3:20](../kjv/neh003.htm#020.md), [Neh
3:21](../kjv/neh003.htm#021).md). His indulgence of Tobiah the Ammonite
provoked the indignation of Nehemiah ([Neh 13:4](../kjv/neh013.htm#004.md),
[Neh 13:7](../kjv/neh013.htm#007).md).

<span id="004">**Eliathah**</span> To whom God will come, one of the
fourteen sons of the Levite Heman, and musician of the temple in the
time of David ([Ch1 25:4](../kjv/ch1025.htm#004).md).

<span id="005">**Elidad**</span> Whom God has loved, son of Chislon, and
chief of the tribe of Benjamin; one of those who were appointed to
divide the Promised Land among the tribes ([Num
34:21](../kjv/num034.htm#021).md).

<span id="006">**Eliel**</span> To whom God is might. (1.) A chief of
Manasseh, on the east of Jordan ([Ch1 5:24](../kjv/ch1005.htm#024).md).

"steward" (R.V., "possessor") of Abraham's house ([Gen
15:2](../kjv/gen015.htm#002), [Gen 15:3](../kjv/gen015.htm#003).md). It was
probably he who headed the embassy sent by Abraham to the old home of
his family in Padan-aram to seek a wife for his son Isaac. The account
of this embassy is given at length in Gen. 24. (2.) The son of Becher,
and grandson of Benjamin ([Ch1 7:8](../kjv/ch1007.htm#008)). (3..md) One of
the two sons of Moses, born during his sojourn in Midian ([Exo
18:4](../kjv/exo018.htm#004); [Ch1 23:15](../kjv/ch1023.htm#015.md), [Ch1
23:17](../kjv/ch1023.htm#017).md). He remained with his mother and brother
Gershom with Jethro when Moses returned to Egypt. ([Exo
18:4](../kjv/exo018.htm#004).md). They were restored to Moses when Jethro
heard of his departure out of Egypt. (4.) One of the priests who blew
the trumpet before the ark when it was brought to Jerusalem ([Ch1
15:24](../kjv/ch1015.htm#024)). (5..md) Son of Zichri, and chief of the

prophet in the time of Jehoshaphat ([Ch2 20:37](../kjv/ch2020.htm#037).md).
Others of this name are mentioned [Luk 3:29](../kjv/luk003.htm#029.md);
[Ezr 8:16](../kjv/ezr008.htm#016); [Ezr 10:18](../kjv/ezr010.htm#018.md),
[Ezr 10:23](../kjv/ezr010.htm#023), [Ezr 10:31](../kjv/ezr010.htm#031.md).

<span id="008">**Elihu**</span> Whose God is he. (1.) "The son of
Barachel, a Buzite" ([Job 32:2](../kjv/job032.htm#002).md), one of Job's
friends. When the debate between Job and his friends is brought to a
close, Elihu for the first time makes his appearance, and delivers his
opinion on the points at issue (Job 32-37). (2.) The son of Tohu, and
grandfather of Elkanah ([Sa1 1:1](../kjv/sa1001.htm#001).md). He is called
also Eliel ([Ch1 6:34](../kjv/ch1006.htm#034).md) and Eliab ([Ch1
6:27](../kjv/ch1006.htm#027)). (3..md) One of the captains of thousands of
Manasseh who joined David at Ziklag ([Ch1
12:20](../kjv/ch1012.htm#020)). (4..md) One of the family of Obed-edom, who
were appointed porters of the temple under David ([Ch1
26:7](../kjv/ch1026.htm#007).md).

<span id="009">**Elijah**</span> Whose God is Jehovah. (1.) "The
Tishbite," the "Elias" of the New Testament, is suddenly introduced to
our notice in [Kg1 17:1](../kjv/kg1017.htm#001.md) as delivering a message
from the Lord to Ahab. There is mention made of a town called Thisbe,
south of Kadesh, but it is impossible to say whether this was the place
referred to in the name given to the prophet. Having delivered his
message to Ahab, he retired at the command of God to a hiding-place by
the brook Cherith, beyond Jordan, where he was fed by ravens. When the
brook dried up God sent him to the widow of Zarephath, a city of Zidon,
from whose scanty store he was supported for the space of two years.
During this period the widow's son died, and was restored to life by
Elijah (1 Kings 17:2-24). During all these two years a famine prevailed
in the land. At the close of this period of retirement and of
preparation for his work (compare [Gal 1:17](../kjv/gal001.htm#017.md),
[Gal 1:18](../kjv/gal001.htm#018).md) Elijah met Obadiah, one of Ahab's
officers, whom he had sent out to seek for pasturage for the cattle, and
bade him go and tell his master that Elijah was there. The king came and
met Elijah, and reproached him as the troubler of Israel. It was then
proposed that sacrifices should be publicly offered, for the purpose of
determining whether Baal or Jehovah were the true God. This was done on
Carmel, with the result that the people fell on their faces, crying,
"The Lord, he is the God." Thus was accomplished the great work of
Elijah's ministry. The prophets of Baal were then put to death by the
order of Elijah. Not one of them escaped. Then immediately followed
rain, according to the word of Elijah, and in answer to his prayer ([Jam
5:18](../kjv/jam005.htm#018).md) Jezebel, enraged at the fate that had
befallen her priests of Baal, threatened to put Elijah to death ([Kg1
19:1](../kjv/kg1019.htm#001).md). He therefore fled in alarm to Beersheba,
and thence went alone a day's journey into the wilderness, and sat down
in despondency under a juniper tree. As he slept an angel touched him,
and said unto him, "Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for
thee." He arose and found a cake and a cruse of water. Having partaken
of the provision thus miraculously supplied, he went forward on his
solitary way for forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mount of God,
where he took up his abode in a cave. Here the Lord appeared unto him
and said, "What dost thou here, Elijah?" In answer to his despondent
words God manifests to him his glory, and then directs him to return to
Damascus and anoint Hazael king over Syria, and Jehu king over Israel,
and Elisha to be prophet in his room ([Kg1
19:13](../kjv/kg1019.htm#013); compare [Kg2 8:7](../kjv/kg2008.htm#007.md);
[Kg2 9:1](../kjv/kg2009.htm#001).md). Some six years after this he warned
Ahab and Jezebel of the violent deaths they would die ([Kg1
21:19](../kjv/kg1021.htm#019); [Kg1 22:38](../kjv/kg1022.htm#038).md). He
also, four years afterwards, warned Ahaziah (q.v.), who had succeeded
his father Ahab, of his approaching death (2 Kings 1:1-16). (See
NABOTH.) During these intervals he probably withdrew to some quiet
retirement, no one knew where. His interview with Ahaziah's messengers
on the way to Ekron, and the account of the destruction of his captains
with their fifties, suggest the idea that he may have been in retirement
at this time on Mount Carmel. The time now drew near when he was to be
taken up into heaven ([Kg2 2:1](../kjv/kg2002.htm#001).md). He had a
presentiment of what was awaiting him. He went down to Gilgal, where was
a school of the prophets, and where his successor Elisha, whom he had
anointed some years before, resided. Elisha was solemnized by the
thought of his master's leaving him, and refused to be parted from him.
"They two went on," and came to Bethel and Jericho, and crossed the
Jordan, the waters of which were "divided hither and thither" when
smitten with Elijah's mantle. Arrived at the borders of Gilead, which
Elijah had left many years before, it "came to pass as they still went
on and talked" they were suddenly separated by a chariot and horses of
fire; and "Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven, "Elisha receiving
his mantle, which fell from him as he ascended. No one of the old
prophets is so frequently referred to in the New Testament. The priests
and Levites said to the Baptist ([Joh 1:25](../kjv/joh001.htm#025).md),
"Why baptizest thou, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias?" Paul ([Rom
11:2](../kjv/rom011.htm#002).md) refers to an incident in his history to
illustrate his argument that God had not cast away his people. James
([Jam 5:17](../kjv/jam005.htm#017).md) finds in him an illustration of the
power of prayer. (See also [Luk 4:25](../kjv/luk004.htm#025.md); [Luk
9:54](../kjv/luk009.htm#054)..md) He was a type of John the Baptist in the
sternest and power of his reproofs ([Luk 9:8](../kjv/luk009.htm#008).md).
He was the Elijah that "must first come" ([Mat
11:11](../kjv/mat011.htm#011), [Mat 11:14](../kjv/mat011.htm#014).md), the
forerunner of our Lord announced by Malachi. Even outwardly the Baptist
corresponded so closely to the earlier prophet that he might be styled a
second Elijah. In him we see "the same connection with a wild and
wilderness country; the same long retirement in the desert; the same
sudden, startling entrance on his work ([Kg1
17:1](../kjv/kg1017.htm#001); [Luk 3:2](../kjv/luk003.htm#002).md); even
the same dress, a hairy garment, and a leather girdle about the loins
([Kg2 1:8](../kjv/kg2001.htm#008); [Mat 3:4](../kjv/mat003.htm#004).md)."
How deep the impression was which Elijah made "on the mind of the nation
may be judged from the fixed belief, which rested on the words of
Malachi ([Mal 4:5](../kjv/mal004.htm#005.md), [Mal
4:6](../kjv/mal004.htm#006).md), which many centuries after prevailed that
he would again appear for the relief and restoration of the country.
Each remarkable person as he arrives on the scene, be his habits and
characteristics what they may, the stern John equally with his gentle
Successor, as proclaimed to be Elijah ([Mat
11:13](../kjv/mat011.htm#013), [Mat 11:14](../kjv/mat011.htm#014.md); [Mat
16:14](../kjv/mat016.htm#014); [Mat 17:10](../kjv/mat017.htm#010.md); [Mar
9:11](../kjv/mar009.htm#011); [Mar 15:35](../kjv/mar015.htm#035.md); [Luk
9:7](../kjv/luk009.htm#007), [Luk 9:8](../kjv/luk009.htm#008.md); [Joh
1:21](../kjv/joh001.htm#021).md). His appearance in glory on the mount of
transfiguration does not seem to have startled the disciples. They were
'sore afraid,' but not apparently surprised." (2.) The Elijah spoken of
in [Ch2 21:12](../kjv/ch2021.htm#012.md) is by some supposed to be a
different person from the foregoing. He lived in the time of Jehoram, to
whom he sent a letter of warning (compare [Ch1
28:19](../kjv/ch1028.htm#019); Jer. 36.md), and acted as a prophet in
Judah; while the Tishbite was a prophet of the northern kingdom. But
there does not seem any necessity for concluding that the writer of this
letter was some other Elijah than the Tishbite. It may be supposed
either that Elijah anticipated the character of Jehoram, and so wrote
the warning message, which was preserved in the schools of the prophets
till Jehoram ascended the throne after the Tishbite's translation, or
that the translation did not actually take place till after the
accession of Jehoram to the throne ([Ch2 21:12](../kjv/ch2021.htm#012.md);
[Kg2 8:16](../kjv/kg2008.htm#016).md). The events of 2 Kings 2 may not be
recorded in chronological order, and thus there may be room for the
opinion that Elijah was still alive in the beginning of Jehoram's reign.
