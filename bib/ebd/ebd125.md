<span id="000">**Eshcol**</span> Bunch; brave. (1.) A young Amoritish
chief who joined Abraham in the recovery of Lot from the hands of
Chedorlaomer ([Gen 14:13](../kjv/gen014.htm#013), [Gen
14:24](../kjv/gen014.htm#024)). (2.) A valley in which the spies
obtained a fine cluster of grapes ([Num 13:23](../kjv/num013.htm#023),
[Num 13:24](../kjv/num013.htm#024); "the brook Eshcol," A.V.; "the
valley of Eshcol," R.V.), which they took back with them to the camp of
Israel as a specimen of the fruits of the Promised Land. On their way
back they explored the route which led into the south (the Negeb) by the
western edge of the mountains at Telilat el-'Anab , i.e.,
"grape-mounds", near Beersheba. "In one of these extensive valleys,
perhaps in Wady Hanein, where miles of grape-mounds even now meet the
eye, they cut the gigantic clusters of grapes, and gathered the
pomegranates and figs, to show how goodly was the land which the Lord
had promised for their inheritance." Palmer's Desert of the Exodus.

<span id="001">**Eshean**</span> A place in the mountains of Judah ([Jos
15:52](../kjv/jos015.htm#052)), supposed to be the ruin es-Simia, near
Dumah, south of Hebron.

<span id="002">**Eshtaol**</span> Narrow pass or recess, a town ([Jos
15:33](../kjv/jos015.htm#033)) in the low country, the She-phelah of
Judah. It was allotted to the tribe of Dan ([Jos
19:41](../kjv/jos019.htm#041)), and was one of their strongholds. Here
Samson spent his boyhood, and first began to show his mighty strength;
and here he was buried in the burying-place of Manoah his father ([Jdg
13:25](../kjv/jdg013.htm#025); [Jdg 16:31](../kjv/jdg016.htm#031); [Jdg
18:2](../kjv/jdg018.htm#002), [Jdg 18:8](../kjv/jdg018.htm#008), [Jdg
18:11](../kjv/jdg018.htm#011), [Jdg 18:12](../kjv/jdg018.htm#012)). It
is identified with the modern Yeshua, on a hill 2 miles east of Zorah.
Others, however, identify it with Kustul, east of Kirjath-jearim.

<span id="003">**Eshtemoa**</span> Obedience, a town in the mountains of
Judah ([Jos 21:14](../kjv/jos021.htm#014); [Ch1
6:57](../kjv/ch1006.htm#057)), which was allotted, with the land round
it, to the priests. It was frequented by David and his followers during
their wanderings; and he sent presents of the spoil of the Amalekites to
his friends there ([Sa1 30:28](../kjv/sa1030.htm#028)). It is identified
with es-Semua, a village about 31/2 miles east of Socoh, and 7 or 8
miles south of Hebron, around which there are ancient remains of the
ruined city. It is the centre of the "south country" or Negeb. It is
also called "Eshtemoh" ([Jos 15:50](../kjv/jos015.htm#050)).

<span id="004">**Espouse**</span> ([Sa2 3:14](../kjv/sa2003.htm#014)),
to betroth. The espousal was a ceremony of betrothing, a formal
agreement between the parties then coming under obligation for the
purpose of marriage. Espousals are in the East frequently contracted
years before the marriage is celebrated. It is referred to as
figuratively illustrating the relations between God and his people ([Jer
2:2](../kjv/jer002.htm#002); [Mat 1:18](../kjv/mat001.htm#018); [Co2
11:2](../kjv/co2011.htm#002)). (See BETROTH.)

<span id="005">**Essenes**</span> A Jewish mystical sect somewhat
resembling the Pharisees. They affected great purity. They originated
about 100 B.C., and disappeared from history after the destruction of
Jerusalem. They are not directly mentioned in Scripture, although they
may be referred to in [Mat 19:11](../kjv/mat019.htm#011), [Mat
19:12](../kjv/mat019.htm#012), [Col 2:8](../kjv/col002.htm#008), [Col
2:18](../kjv/col002.htm#018), [Col 2:23](../kjv/col002.htm#023).

<span id="006">**Esther**</span> The queen of Ahasuerus, and heroine of
the book that bears her name. She was a Jewess named Hadassah (the
myrtle), but when she entered the royal harem she received the name by
which she henceforth became known ([Est 2:7](../kjv/est002.htm#007)). It
is a Syro-Arabian modification of the Persian word satarah, which means
a star. She was the daughter of Abihail, a Benjamite. Her family did not
avail themselves of the permission granted by Cyrus to the exiles to
return to Jerusalem; and she resided with her cousin Mordecai, who held
some office in the household of the Persian king at "Shushan in the
palace." Ahasuerus having divorced Vashti, chose Esther to be his wife.
Soon after this he gave Haman the Agagite, his prime minister, power and
authority to kill and extirpate all the Jews throughout the Persian
empire. By the interposition of Esther this terrible catastrophe was
averted. Haman was hanged on the gallows he had intended for Mordecai
([Est 7:1](../kjv/est007.htm#001)); and the Jews established an annual
feast, the feast of Purim (q.v.), in memory of their wonderful
deliverance. This took place about fifty-two years after the Return, the
year of the great battles of Plataea and Mycale (479 B.C.). Esther
appears in the Bible as a "woman of deep piety, faith, courage,
patriotism, and caution, combined with resolution; a dutiful daughter to
her adopted father, docile and obedient to his counsels, and anxious to
share the king's favour with him for the good of the Jewish people.
There must have been a singular grace and charm in her aspect and
manners, since 'she obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked
upon her' ([Est 2:15](../kjv/est002.htm#015)). That she was raised up as
an instrument in the hand of God to avert the destruction of the Jewish
people, and to afford them protection and forward their wealth and peace
in their captivity, is also manifest from the Scripture account."

<span id="007">**Esther, Book of**</span> The authorship of this book is
unknown. It must have been obviously written after the death of
Ahasuerus (the Xerxes of the Greeks), which took place 465 B.C.. The
minute and particular account also given of many historical details
makes it probable that the writer was contemporary with Mordecai and
Esther. Hence we may conclude that the book was written probably about
444-434 B.C., and that the author was one of the Jews of the dispersion.
This book is more purely historical than any other book of Scripture;
and it has this remarkable peculiarity that the name of God does not
occur in it from first to last in any form. It has, however, been well
observed that "though the name of God be not in it, his finger is." The
book wonderfully exhibits the providential government of God.

<span id="008">**Etam**</span> Eyrie. (1.) A village of the tribe of
Simeon ([Ch1 4:32](../kjv/ch1004.htm#032)). Into some cleft ("top,"
A.V.,; R.V., "cleft") of a rock here Samson retired after his slaughter
of the Philistines ([Jdg 15:8](../kjv/jdg015.htm#008), [Jdg
15:11](../kjv/jdg015.htm#011)). It was a natural stronghold. It has been
identified with Beit'Atab , west of Bethlehem, near Zorah and Eshtaol.
On the crest of a rocky knoll, under the village, is a long tunnel,
which may be the "cleft" in which Samson hid. (2.) A city of Judah,
fortified by Rehoboam ([Ch2 11:6](../kjv/ch2011.htm#006)). It was near
Bethlehem and Tekoah, and some distance apparently to the north of (1).
It seems to have been in the district called Nephtoah (or Netophah),
where were the sources of the water from which Solomon's gardens and
pleasure-grounds and pools, as well as Bethlehem and the temple, were
supplied. It is now 'Ain'Atan , at the head of the Wady Urtas, a
fountain sending forth a copious supply of pure water.

<span id="009">**Eternal Life**</span> This expression occurs in the Old
Testament only in [Dan 12:2](../kjv/dan012.htm#002) (R.V., "everlasting
life"). It occurs frequently in the New Testament ([Mat
7:14](../kjv/mat007.htm#014); [Mat 18:8](../kjv/mat018.htm#008), [Mat
18:9](../kjv/mat018.htm#009); [Luk 10:28](../kjv/luk010.htm#028);
compare [Luk 18:18](../kjv/luk018.htm#018)). It comprises the whole
future of the redeemed ([Luk 16:9](../kjv/luk016.htm#009)), and is
opposed to "eternal punishment" ([Mat 19:29](../kjv/mat019.htm#029);
[Mat 25:46](../kjv/mat025.htm#046)). It is the final reward and glory
into which the children of God enter ([Ti1 6:12](../kjv/ti1006.htm#012),
[Ti1 6:19](../kjv/ti1006.htm#019); [Rom 6:22](../kjv/rom006.htm#022);
[Gal 6:8](../kjv/gal006.htm#008); [Ti1 1:16](../kjv/ti1001.htm#016);
[Rom 5:21](../kjv/rom005.htm#021)); their Sabbath of rest ([Heb
4:9](../kjv/heb004.htm#009); compare [Heb
12:22](../kjv/heb012.htm#022)). The newness of life which the believer
derives from Christ ([Rom 6:4](../kjv/rom006.htm#004)) is the very
essence of salvation, and hence the life of glory or the eternal life
must also be theirs ([Rom 6:8](../kjv/rom006.htm#008); [Ti2
2:11](../kjv/ti2002.htm#011), [Ti2 2:12](../kjv/ti2002.htm#012); [Rom
5:17](../kjv/rom005.htm#017), [Rom 5:21](../kjv/rom005.htm#021); [Rom
8:30](../kjv/rom008.htm#030); [Eph 2:5](../kjv/eph002.htm#005), [Eph
2:6](../kjv/eph002.htm#006)). It is the "gift of God in Jesus Christ our
Lord" ([Rom 6:23](../kjv/rom006.htm#023)). The life the faithful have
here on earth ([Joh 3:36](../kjv/joh003.htm#036); [Joh
5:24](../kjv/joh005.htm#024); [Joh 6:47](../kjv/joh006.htm#047), [Joh
6:53](../kjv/joh006.htm#053)) is inseparably connected with the eternal
life beyond, the endless life of the future, the happy future of the
saints in heaven ([Mat 19:16](../kjv/mat019.htm#016), [Mat
19:29](../kjv/mat019.htm#029); [Mat 25:46](../kjv/mat025.htm#046)).
