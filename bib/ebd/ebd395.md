<span id="000">**Ziz**</span> Projecting; a flower, a cleft or pass,
probably that near En-gedi, which leads up from the Dead Sea ([Ch2
20:16](../kjv/ch2020.htm#016)) in the direction of Tekoa; now Tell
Hasasah.

<span id="001">**Ziza**</span> Splendour; abundance. (1.) A Simeonite
prince ([Ch1 4:37](../kjv/ch1004.htm#037)). (2.) A son of Rehoboam ([Ch2
11:20](../kjv/ch2011.htm#020)).

<span id="002">**Zizah**</span> A Gershonite Levite ([Ch1
23:11](../kjv/ch1023.htm#011)).

<span id="003">**Zoan**</span> (Old Egypt. Sant = "stronghold," the
modern San). A city on the Tanitic branch of the Nile, called by the
Greeks Tanis. It was built seven years after Hebron in Palestine ([Num
13:22](../kjv/num013.htm#022)). This great and important city was the
capital of the Hyksos, or Shepherd kings, who ruled Egypt for more than
500 years. It was the frontier town of Goshen. Here Pharaoh was holding
his court at the time of his various interviews with Moses and Aaron.
"No trace of Zoan exists; Tanis was built over it, and city after city
has been built over the ruins of that" (Harper, Bible and Modern
Discovery). Extensive mounds of ruins, the wreck of the ancient city,
now mark its site ([Isa 19:11](../kjv/isa019.htm#011), [Isa
19:13](../kjv/isa019.htm#013); [Isa 30:4](../kjv/isa030.htm#004); [Eze
30:14](../kjv/eze030.htm#014)). "The whole constitutes one of the
grandest and oldest ruins in the world." This city was also called "the
Field of Zoan" ([Psa 78:12](../kjv/psa078.htm#012), [Psa
78:43](../kjv/psa078.htm#043)) and "the Town of Rameses" (q.v.), because
the oppressor rebuilt and embellished it, probably by the forced labour
of the Hebrews, and made it his northern capital.

<span id="004">**Zoar**</span> Small, a town on the east or south-east
of the Dead Sea, to which Lot and his daughters fled from Sodom ([Gen
19:22](../kjv/gen019.htm#022), [Gen 19:23](../kjv/gen019.htm#023)). It
was originally called Bela ([Gen 14:2](../kjv/gen014.htm#002), [Gen
14:8](../kjv/gen014.htm#008)). It is referred to by the prophets Isaiah
([Isa 15:5](../kjv/isa015.htm#005)) and Jeremiah ([Jer
48:34](../kjv/jer048.htm#034)). Its ruins are still seen at the opening
of the ravine of Kerak, the Kir-Moab referred to in 2 Kings 3, the
modern Tell esh-Shaghur.

<span id="005">**Zobah**</span> =Aram-Zobah ([Psa
60:1](../kjv/psa060.htm#001), title), a Syrian province or kingdom to
the south of Coele-Syria, and extending from the eastern slopes of
Lebanon north and east toward the Euphrates. Saul and David had war with
the kings of Zobah ([Sa1 14:47](../kjv/sa1014.htm#047); [Sa2
8:3](../kjv/sa2008.htm#003); [Sa2 10:6](../kjv/sa2010.htm#006)).

<span id="006">**Zohar**</span> Brightness. (1.) The father of Ephron
the Hittite ([Gen 23:8](../kjv/gen023.htm#008)). (2.) One of the sons of
Simeon ([Gen 46:10](../kjv/gen046.htm#010); [Exo
6:15](../kjv/exo006.htm#015)).

<span id="007">**Zoheleth**</span> The serpent-stone, a rocky plateau
near the centre of the village of Siloam, and near the fountain of
En-rogel, to which the women of the village resort for water ([Kg1
1:5](../kjv/kg1001.htm#005)). Here Adonijah (q.v.) feasted all the royal
princess except Solomon and the men who took part with him in his effort
to succeed to the throne. While they were assembled here Solomon was
proclaimed king, through the intervention of Nathan. On hearing this,
Adonijah fled and took refuge in the sanctuary ([Kg1
1:49](../kjv/kg1001.htm#049)). He was afterwards pardoned. Zoheleth
projects into or slightly over-hangs the Kidron valley. It is now called
ez-Zehwell or Zahweileh.

<span id="008">**Zoheth**</span> Snatching (?), one of the sons of Ishi
([Ch1 4:20](../kjv/ch1004.htm#020)).

<span id="009">**Zophah**</span> Spreading out, a son of Helem ([Ch1
7:35](../kjv/ch1007.htm#035)), a chief of Asher.
