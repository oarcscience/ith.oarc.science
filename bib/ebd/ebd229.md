<span id="000">**Life**</span> Generally of physical life ([Gen
2:7](../kjv/gen002.htm#007); [Luk 16:25](../kjv/luk016.htm#025), etc.);
also used figuratively (1.) for immortality ([Heb
7:16](../kjv/heb007.htm#016)); (2.) conduct or manner of life ([Rom
6:4](../kjv/rom006.htm#004)); (3.) spiritual life or salvation ([Joh
3:16](../kjv/joh003.htm#016), [Joh 3:17](../kjv/joh003.htm#017), [Joh
3:18](../kjv/joh003.htm#018), [Joh 3:36](../kjv/joh003.htm#036)); (4.)
eternal life ([Mat 19:16](../kjv/mat019.htm#016), [Mat
19:17](../kjv/mat019.htm#017); [Joh 3:15](../kjv/joh003.htm#015)); of
God and Christ as the absolute source and cause of all life ([Joh
1:4](../kjv/joh001.htm#004); [Joh 5:26](../kjv/joh005.htm#026), [Joh
5:39](../kjv/joh005.htm#039); [Joh 11:25](../kjv/joh011.htm#025); [Joh
12:50](../kjv/joh012.htm#050)).

<span id="001">**Light**</span> The offspring of the divine command
([Gen 1:3](../kjv/gen001.htm#003)). "All the more joyous emotions of the
mind, all the pleasing sensations of the frame, all the happy hours of
domestic intercourse were habitually described among the Hebrews under
imagery derived from light" ([Kg1 11:36](../kjv/kg1011.htm#036); [Isa
58:8](../kjv/isa058.htm#008); [Est 8:16](../kjv/est008.htm#016); [Psa
97:11](../kjv/psa097.htm#011)). Light came also naturally to typify true
religion and the felicity it imparts ([Psa
119:105](../kjv/psa119.htm#105); [Isa 8:20](../kjv/isa008.htm#020); [Mat
4:16](../kjv/mat004.htm#016), etc.), and the glorious inheritance of the
redeemed ([Col 1:12](../kjv/col001.htm#012); [Rev
21:23](../kjv/rev021.htm#023)). God is said to dwell in light
inaccessible ([Ti1 6:16](../kjv/ti1006.htm#016)). It frequently
signifies instruction ([Mat 5:16](../kjv/mat005.htm#016); [Joh
5:35](../kjv/joh005.htm#035)). In its highest sense it is applied to
Christ as the "Sun of righteousness" ([Mal 4:2](../kjv/mal004.htm#002);
[Luk 2:32](../kjv/luk002.htm#032); [Joh 1:7](../kjv/joh001.htm#007)).
God is styled "the Father of lights" ([Jam
1:17](../kjv/jam001.htm#017)). It is used of angels ([Co2
11:14](../kjv/co2011.htm#014)), and of John the Baptist, who was a
"burning and a shining light" ([Joh 5:35](../kjv/joh005.htm#035)), and
of all true disciples, who are styled "the light of the world" ([Mat
5:14](../kjv/mat005.htm#014)).

<span id="002">**Lightning**</span> Frequently referred to by the sacred
writers ([Nah 1:3](../kjv/nah001.htm#003)). Thunder and lightning are
spoken of as tokens of God's wrath ([Sa2 22:15](../kjv/sa2022.htm#015);
[Job 28:26](../kjv/job028.htm#026); [Job 37:4](../kjv/job037.htm#004);
[Psa 135:7](../kjv/psa135.htm#007); [Psa 144:6](../kjv/psa144.htm#006);
[Zac 9:14](../kjv/zac009.htm#014)). They represent God's glorious and
awful majesty ([Rev 4:5](../kjv/rev004.htm#005)), or some judgment of
God on the world ([Rev 20:9](../kjv/rev020.htm#009)).

<span id="003">**Lign-aloes**</span> (only in pl., Heb. 'ahalim ), a
perfume derived from some Oriental tree ([Num
24:6](../kjv/num024.htm#006)), probably the agallochum or aloe-wood.
(See ALOES).

<span id="004">**Ligure**</span> (Heb. leshem ) occurs only in [Exo
28:19](../kjv/exo028.htm#019) and [Exo 39:12](../kjv/exo039.htm#012), as
the name of a stone in the third row on the high priest's breastplate.
Some have supposed that this stone was the same as the jacinth (q.v.),
others that it was the opal. There is now no mineral bearing this name.
The "ligurite" is so named from Liguria in Italy, where it was found.

<span id="005">**Lily**</span> The Hebrew name shushan or shoshan, i.e.,
"whiteness", was used as the general name of several plants common to
Syria, such as the tulip, iris, anemone, gladiolus, ranunculus, etc.
Some interpret it, with much probability, as denoting in the Old
Testament the water-lily (Nymphoea lotus of Linn.), or lotus ([Sol
2:1](../kjv/sol002.htm#001), [Sol 2:2](../kjv/sol002.htm#002); [Sol
2:16](../kjv/sol002.htm#016); [Sol 4:5](../kjv/sol004.htm#005); [Sol
5:13](../kjv/sol005.htm#013); [Sol 6:2](../kjv/sol006.htm#002), [Sol
6:3](../kjv/sol006.htm#003); [Sol 7:2](../kjv/sol007.htm#002)). "Its
flowers are large, and they are of a white colour, with streaks of pink.
They supplied models for the ornaments of the pillars and the molten
sea" ([Kg1 7:19](../kjv/kg1007.htm#019), [Kg1
7:22](../kjv/kg1007.htm#022), [Kg1 7:26](../kjv/kg1007.htm#026); [Ch2
4:5](../kjv/ch2004.htm#005)). In the Canticles its beauty and fragrance
shadow forth the preciousness of Christ to the Church. Groser, however
(Scrip. Nat. Hist.), strongly argues that the word, both in the Old and
New Testaments, denotes liliaceous plants in general, or if one genus is
to be selected, that it must be the genus Iris, which is "large,
vigorous, elegant in form, and gorgeous in colouring." The lilies (Gr.
krinia ) spoken of in the New Testament ([Mat
6:28](../kjv/mat006.htm#028); [Luk 12:27](../kjv/luk012.htm#027)) were
probably the scarlet martagon (Lilium Chalcedonicum) or "red Turk's-cap
lily", which "comes into flower at the season of the year when our
Lord's sermon on the mount is supposed to have been delivered. It is
abundant in the district of Galilee; and its fine scarlet flowers render
it a very conspicuous and showy object, which would naturally attract
the attention of the hearers" (Balfour's Plants of the Bible). Of the
true "floral glories of Palestine" the pheasant's eye (Adonis
Palestina), the ranunuculus (R. Asiaticus), and the anemone (A
coronaria), the last named is however, with the greatest probability
regarded as the "lily of the field" to which our Lord refers.
"Certainly," says Tristram (Nat. Hist. of the Bible), "if, in the
wondrous richness of bloom which characterizes the land of Israel in
spring, any one plant can claim pre-eminence, it is the anemone, the
most natural flower for our Lord to pluck and seize upon as an
illustration, whether walking in the fields or sitting on the
hill-side." "The white water-lily (Nymphcea alba) and the yellow
water-lily (Nuphar lutea) are both abundant in the marshes of the Upper
Jordan, but have no connection with the lily of Scripture."

<span id="006">**Lime**</span> The Hebrew word so rendered means
"boiling" or "effervescing." From [Isa 33:12](../kjv/isa033.htm#012) it
appears that lime was made in a kiln lighted by thorn-bushes. In [Amo
2:1](../kjv/amo002.htm#001) it is recorded that the king of Moab "burned
the bones of the king of Edom into lime." The same Hebrew word is used
in [Deu 27:2](../kjv/deu027.htm#002), and is there rendered "plaster."
Limestone is the chief constituent of the mountains of Syria.

<span id="007">**Lines**</span> Were used for measuring and dividing
land; and hence the word came to denote a portion or inheritance
measured out; a possession ([Psa 16:6](../kjv/psa016.htm#006)).

<span id="008">**Linen**</span> (1.) Heb., pishet, pishtah, denotes
"flax," of which linen is made ([Isa 19:9](../kjv/isa019.htm#009));
wrought flax, i.e., "linen cloth", [Lev 13:47](../kjv/lev013.htm#047),
[Lev 13:48](../kjv/lev013.htm#048), [Lev 13:52](../kjv/lev013.htm#052),
[Lev 13:59](../kjv/lev013.htm#059); [Deu 22:11](../kjv/deu022.htm#011).
Flax was early cultivated in Egypt ([Exo 9:31](../kjv/exo009.htm#031)),
and also in Palestine ([Jos 2:6](../kjv/jos002.htm#006); [Hos
2:9](../kjv/hos002.htm#009)). Various articles were made of it: garment
([Sa2 6:14](../kjv/sa2006.htm#014)), girdles ([Jer
13:1](../kjv/jer013.htm#001)), ropes and thread ([Eze
40:3](../kjv/eze040.htm#003)), napkins ([Luk
24:12](../kjv/luk024.htm#012); [Joh 20:7](../kjv/joh020.htm#007)),
turbans ([Eze 44:18](../kjv/eze044.htm#018)), and lamp-wicks ([Isa
42:3](../kjv/isa042.htm#003)). (2.) Heb. buts , "whiteness;" rendered
"fine linen" in [Ch1 4:21](../kjv/ch1004.htm#021); [Ch1
15:27](../kjv/ch1015.htm#027); [Ch2 2:14](../kjv/ch2002.htm#014); [Ch2
3:14](../kjv/ch2003.htm#014); [Est 1:6](../kjv/est001.htm#006); [Est
8:15](../kjv/est008.htm#015), and "white linen" [Ch2
5:12](../kjv/ch2005.htm#012). It is not certain whether this word means
cotton or linen. (3.) Heb. bad ; rendered "linen" [Exo
28:42](../kjv/exo028.htm#042); [Exo 39:28](../kjv/exo039.htm#028); [Lev
6:10](../kjv/lev006.htm#010); [Lev 16:4](../kjv/lev016.htm#004), [Lev
16:23](../kjv/lev016.htm#023), [Lev 16:32](../kjv/lev016.htm#032); [Sa1
2:18](../kjv/sa1002.htm#018); [Sa2 6:14](../kjv/sa2006.htm#014), etc. It
is uniformly used of the sacred vestments worn by the priests. The word
is from a root signifying "separation." (4.) Heb. shesh ; rendered "fine
linen" [Exo 25:4](../kjv/exo025.htm#004); [Exo
26:1](../kjv/exo026.htm#001), [Exo 26:31](../kjv/exo026.htm#031), [Exo
26:36](../kjv/exo026.htm#036), etc. In [Pro
31:22](../kjv/pro031.htm#022) it is rendered in Authorized Version
"silk," and in Revised Version "fine linen." The word denotes Egyptian
linen of peculiar whiteness and fineness (byssus). The finest Indian
linen, the finest now made, has in an inch one hundred threads of warp
and eighty-four of woof; while the Egyptian had sometimes one hundred
and forty in the warp and sixty-four in the woof. This was the usual
dress of the Egyptian priest. Pharaoh arrayed Joseph in a dress of linen
([Gen 41:42](../kjv/gen041.htm#042)). (5.) Heb. 'etun . [Pro
7:16](../kjv/pro007.htm#016), "fine linen of Egypt;" in Revised Version,
"the yarn of Egypt." (6.) Heb. sadin . [Pro
31:24](../kjv/pro031.htm#024), "fine linen;" in Revised Version, "linen
garments" ([Jdg 14:12](../kjv/jdg014.htm#012), [Jdg
14:13](../kjv/jdg014.htm#013); [Isa 3:23](../kjv/isa003.htm#023)). From
this Hebrew word is probably derived the Greek word sindon , rendered
"linen" in [Mar 14:51](../kjv/mar014.htm#051), [Mar
14:52](../kjv/mar014.htm#052); [Mar 15:46](../kjv/mar015.htm#046); [Mat
27:59](../kjv/mat027.htm#059). The word "linen" is used as an emblem of
moral purity ([Rev 15:6](../kjv/rev015.htm#006)). In [Luk
16:19](../kjv/luk016.htm#019) it is mentioned as a mark of luxury.
