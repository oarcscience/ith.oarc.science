<span id="000">**Baptism for the Dead**</span> Only mentioned in [Co1
15:29](../kjv/co1015.htm#029). This expression as used by the apostle
may be equivalent to saying, "He who goes through a baptism of blood in
order to join a glorified church which has no existence \[i.e., if the
dead rise not\] is a fool." Some also regard the statement here as an
allusion to the strange practice which began, it is said, to prevail at
Corinth, in which a person was baptized in the stead of others who had
died before being baptized, to whom it was hoped some of the benefits of
that rite would be extended. This they think may have been one of the
erroneous customs which Paul went to Corinth to "set in order."

<span id="001">**Bar**</span> Used to denote the means by which a door
is bolted ([Neh 3:3](../kjv/neh003.htm#003)); a rock in the sea ([Jon
2:6](../kjv/jon002.htm#006)); the shore of the sea ([Job
38:10](../kjv/job038.htm#010)); strong fortifications and powerful
impediments, etc. ([Isa 45:2](../kjv/isa045.htm#002); [Amo
1:5](../kjv/amo001.htm#005)); defenses of a city ([Kg1
4:13](../kjv/kg1004.htm#013)). A bar for a door was of iron ([Isa
45:2](../kjv/isa045.htm#002)), brass ([Psa
107:16](../kjv/psa107.htm#016)), or wood ([Nah
3:13](../kjv/nah003.htm#013)).

<span id="002">**Barabbas**</span> I.e., son of Abba or of a father, a
notorious robber whom Pilate proposed to condemn to death instead of
Jesus, whom he wished to release, in accordance with the Roman custom
([Joh 18:40](../kjv/joh018.htm#040); [Mar 15:7](../kjv/mar015.htm#007);
[Luk 23:19](../kjv/luk023.htm#019)). But the Jews were so bent on the
death of Jesus that they demanded that Barabbas should be pardoned ([Mat
27:16](../kjv/mat027.htm#016); [Act 3:14](../kjv/act003.htm#014)). This
Pilate did.

<span id="003">**Barachel**</span> Whom God has blessed, a Buzite, the
father of Elihu, one of Job's friends ([Job
32:2](../kjv/job032.htm#002), [Job 32:6](../kjv/job032.htm#006)).

<span id="004">**Barachias**</span> Berechiah, (4.) (q.v.), whom Jehovah
hath blessed, father of the prophet Zechariah ([Zac
1:1](../kjv/zac001.htm#001), [Zac 1:7](../kjv/zac001.htm#007); [Mat
23:35](../kjv/mat023.htm#035)).

<span id="005">**Barak**</span> Lightning, the son of Abinoam ([Jdg
4:6](../kjv/jdg004.htm#006)). At the summons of Deborah he made war
against Jabin. She accompanied him into the battle, and gave the signal
for the little army to make the attack; in which the host of Jabin was
completely routed. The battle was fought ([Jdg
4:16](../kjv/jdg004.htm#016)) in the plain of Jezreel (q.v.) This
deliverance of Israel is commemorated in Judg. 5. Barak's faith is
commended ([Heb 11:32](../kjv/heb011.htm#032)). "The character of Barak,
though pious, does not seem to have been heroic. Like Gideon, and in a
sense Samson, he is an illustration of the words in [Heb
11:34](../kjv/heb011.htm#034), 'Out of weakness were made strong.'" (See
Deborah.)

<span id="006">**Barbarian**</span> A Greek word used in the New
Testament ([Rom 1:14](../kjv/rom001.htm#014)) to denote one of another
nation. In [Col 3:11](../kjv/col003.htm#011), the word more definitely
designates those nations of the Roman empire that did not speak Greek.
In [Co1 14:11](../kjv/co1014.htm#011), it simply refers to one speaking
a different language. The inhabitants of Malta are so called ([Act
28:1](../kjv/act028.htm#001), [Act 28:2](../kjv/act028.htm#002), [Act
28:4](../kjv/act028.htm#004)). They were originally a Carthaginian
colony. This word nowhere in Scripture bears the meaning it does in
modern times.

<span id="007">**Barber**</span> Found only once, in [Eze
5:1](../kjv/eze005.htm#001), where reference is made to the Jewish
custom of shaving the head as a sign of mourning. The Nazarites were
untouched by the razor from their birth ([Num
6:5](../kjv/num006.htm#005)). Compare [Jdg
16:19](../kjv/jdg016.htm#019).

<span id="008">**Barefoot**</span> To go barefoot was a sign of great
distress ([Isa 20:2](../kjv/isa020.htm#002), [Isa
20:3](../kjv/isa020.htm#003), [Isa 20:4](../kjv/isa020.htm#004)), or of
some great calamity having fallen on a person ([Sa2
15:30](../kjv/sa2015.htm#030)).

<span id="009">**Bariah**</span> Fugitive, one of Shemaiah's five sons.
Their father is counted along with them in [Ch1
3:22](../kjv/ch1003.htm#022).
