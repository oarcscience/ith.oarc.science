<span id="000">**Fountain**</span> (Heb. 'ain ; i.e., "eye" of the water
desert), a natural source of living water. Palestine was a "land of
brooks of water, of fountains, and depths that spring out of valleys and
hills" ([Deu 8:7](../kjv/deu008.htm#007.md); [Deu
11:11](../kjv/deu011.htm#011).md). These fountains, bright sparkling "eyes"
of the desert, are remarkable for their abundance and their beauty,
especially on the west of Jordan. All the perennial rivers and streams
of the country are supplied from fountains, and depend comparatively
little on surface water. "Palestine is a country of mountains and hills,
and it abounds in fountains of water. The murmur of these waters is
heard in every dell, and the luxuriant foliage which surrounds and the
luxuriant foliage which surrounds them is seen in every plain." Besides
its rain-water, its cisterns and fountains, Jerusalem had also an
abundant supply of water in the magnificent reservoir called "Solomon's
Pools" (q.v.), at the head of the Urtas valley, whence it was conveyed
to the city by subterranean channels some 10 miles in length. These have
all been long ago destroyed, so that no water from the "Pools" now
reaches Jerusalem. Only one fountain has been discovered at Jerusalem,
one fountain has been discovered at Jerusalem, the so-called "Virgin's
Fountains," in the valley of Kidron; and only one well (Heb. beer ), the
Bir Eyub, also in the valley of Kidron, south of the King's Gardens,
which has been dug through the solid rock. The inhabitants of Jerusalem
are now mainly dependent on the winter rains, which they store in
cisterns. (See WELL.)

<span id="001">**Fountain of the Virgin**</span> The perennial source
from which the Pool of Siloam (q.v.) is supplied, the waters flowing in
a copious stream to it through a tunnel cut through the rock, the actual
length of which is 1,750 feet. The spring rises in a cave 20 feet by 7.
A serpentine tunnel 67 feet long runs from it toward the left, off which
the tunnel to the Pool of Siloam branches. It is the only unfailing
fountain in Jerusalem. The fountain received its name from the
"fantastic legend" that here the virgin washed the swaddling-clothes of
our Lord. This spring has the singular characteristic of being
intermittent, flowing from three to five times daily in winter, twice
daily in summer, and only once daily in autumn. This peculiarity is
accounted for by the supposition that the outlet from the reservoir is
by a passage in the form of a siphon.

<span id="002">**Fowler**</span> The arts of, referred to [Psa
91:3](../kjv/psa091.htm#003); [Psa 124:7](../kjv/psa124.htm#007.md); [Pro
6:5](../kjv/pro006.htm#005); [Jer 5:26](../kjv/jer005.htm#026.md); [Hos
9:8](../kjv/hos009.htm#008); [Eze 17:20](../kjv/eze017.htm#020.md); [Ecc
9:12](../kjv/ecc009.htm#012.md). Birds of all kinds abound in Palestine,
and the capture of these for the table and for other uses formed the
employment of many persons. The traps and snares used for this purpose
are mentioned [Hos 5:1](../kjv/hos005.htm#001.md); [Pro
7:23](../kjv/pro007.htm#023); [Pro 22:5](../kjv/pro022.htm#005.md); [Amo
3:5](../kjv/amo003.htm#005); [Psa 69:22](../kjv/psa069.htm#022.md); compare
[Deu 22:6](../kjv/deu022.htm#006), [Deu 22:7](../kjv/deu022.htm#007.md).

<span id="003">**Fox**</span> (Heb. shu'al , a name derived from its
digging or burrowing under ground), the Vulpes thaleb, or Syrian fox,
the only species of this animal indigenous to Palestine. It burrows, is
silent and solitary in its habits, is destructive to vineyards, being a
plunderer of ripe grapes ([Sol 2:15](../kjv/sol002.htm#015).md). The Vulpes
Niloticus, or Egyptian dog-fox, and the Vulpes vulgaris, or common fox,
are also found in Palestine. The proverbial cunning of the fox is
alluded to in [Eze 13:4](../kjv/eze013.htm#004.md), and in [Luk
13:32](../kjv/luk013.htm#032.md), where our Lord calls Herod "that fox." In
[Jdg 15:4](../kjv/jdg015.htm#004), [Jdg 15:5](../kjv/jdg015.htm#005.md),
the reference is in all probability to the jackal. The Hebrew word
shu'al through the Persian schagal becomes our jackal (Canis aureus), so
that the word may bear that signification here. The reasons for
preferring the rendering "jackal" are (1.) that it is more easily caught
than the fox; (2.) that the fox is shy and suspicious, and flies
mankind, while the jackal does not; and (3.) that foxes are difficult,
jackals comparatively easy, to treat in the way here described. Jackals
hunt in large numbers, and are still very numerous in Southern
Palestine.

<span id="004">**Frankincense**</span> (Heb. lebonah ; Gr. libanos ,
i.e., "white"), an odorous resin imported from Arabia ([Isa
60:6](../kjv/isa060.htm#006); [Jer 6:20](../kjv/jer006.htm#020).md), yet
also growing in Palestine ([Sol 4:14](../kjv/sol004.htm#014).md). It was
one of the ingredients in the perfume of the sanctuary ([Exo
30:34](../kjv/exo030.htm#034).md), and was used as an accompaniment of the
meat-offering ([Lev 2:1](../kjv/lev002.htm#001.md), [Lev
2:16](../kjv/lev002.htm#016); [Lev 6:15](../kjv/lev006.htm#015.md); [Lev
24:7](../kjv/lev024.htm#007).md). When burnt it emitted a fragrant odor,
and hence the incense became a symbol of the Divine name ([Mal
1:11](../kjv/mal001.htm#011); [Sol 1:3](../kjv/sol001.htm#003).md) and an
emblem of prayer ([Psa 141:2](../kjv/psa141.htm#002.md); [Luk
1:10](../kjv/luk001.htm#010); [Rev 5:8](../kjv/rev005.htm#008.md); [Rev
8:3](../kjv/rev008.htm#003).md). This frankincense, or olibanum, used by
the Jews in the temple services is not to be confounded with the
frankincense of modern commerce, which is an exudation of the Norway
spruce fir, the Pinus abies. It was probably a resin from the Indian
tree known to botanists by the name of Boswellia serrata or thurifera,
which grows to the height of forty feet.

<span id="005">**Freedom**</span> The law of Moses pointed out the cases
in which the servants of the Hebrews were to receive their freedom ([Exo
21:2](../kjv/exo021.htm#002), [Exo 21:7](../kjv/exo021.htm#007.md), [Exo
21:8](../kjv/exo021.htm#008); [Lev 25:39](../kjv/lev025.htm#039.md), [Lev
25:47](../kjv/lev025.htm#047); [Deu 15:12](../kjv/deu015.htm#012).md).
Under the Roman law the "freeman" (ingenuus) was one born free; the
"freedman" (libertinus) was a manumitted slave, and had not equal rights
with the freeman ([Act 22:28](../kjv/act022.htm#028.md); compare [Act
16:37](../kjv/act016.htm#037); [Act 21:39](../kjv/act021.htm#039.md); [Act
22:25](../kjv/act022.htm#025); [Act 25:11](../kjv/act025.htm#011.md), [Act
25:12](../kjv/act025.htm#012).md).

<span id="006">**Free-will Offering**</span> A spontaneous gift ([Exo
35:29](../kjv/exo035.htm#029).md), a voluntary sacrifice ([Lev
22:23](../kjv/lev022.htm#023); [Ezr 3:5](../kjv/ezr003.htm#005).md), as
opposed to one in consequence of a vow, or in expiation of some offense.

<span id="007">**Frog**</span> (Heb. tsepharde'a , meaning a
"marsh-leaper"). This reptile is mentioned in the Old Testament only in
connection with one of the plagues which fell on the land of Egypt ([Exo
8:2](../kjv/exo008.htm#002); [Psa 78:45](../kjv/psa078.htm#045.md); [Psa
105:30](../kjv/psa105.htm#030).md). In the New Testament this word occurs
only in [Rev 16:13](../kjv/rev016.htm#013.md), where it is referred to as a
symbol of uncleanness. The only species of frog existing in Palestine is
the green frog (Rana esculenta), the well-known edible frog of the
Continent.

<span id="008">**Frontlets**</span> Occurs only in [Exo
13:16](../kjv/exo013.htm#016); [Deu 6:8](../kjv/deu006.htm#008.md); [Deu
11:18](../kjv/deu011.htm#018.md). The meaning of the injunction to the
Israelites, with regard to the statues and precepts given them, that
they should "bind them for a sign upon their hand, and have them as
frontlets between their eyes," was that they should keep them distinctly
in view and carefully attend to them. But soon after their return from
Babylon they began to interpret this injunction literally, and had
accordingly portions of the law written out and worn about their person.
These they called tephillin, i.e., "prayers." The passages so written
out on strips of parchment were these, [Exo
12:2](../kjv/exo012.htm#002); [Exo 13:11](../kjv/exo013.htm#011.md); [Deu
6:4](../kjv/deu006.htm#004); [Deu 11:18](../kjv/deu011.htm#018.md). They
were then "rolled up in a case of black calfskin, which was attached to
a stiffer piece of leather, having a thong one finger broad and one
cubit and a half long. Those worn on the forehead were written on four
strips of parchment, and put into four little cells within a square
case, which had on it the Hebrew letter called shin, the three points of
which were regarded as an emblem of God." This case tied around the
forehead in a particular way was called "the tephillah on the head."
(See PHYLACTERY.)

<span id="009">**Frost**</span> (Heb. kerah , from its smoothness) [Job
37:10](../kjv/job037.htm#010) (R.V., "ice".md); [Gen
31:40](../kjv/gen031.htm#040); [Jer 36:30](../kjv/jer036.htm#030.md);
rendered "ice" in [Job 6:16](../kjv/job006.htm#016.md); [Job
38:29](../kjv/job038.htm#029.md); and "crystal" in [Eze
1:22](../kjv/eze001.htm#022.md). "At the present day frost is entirely
unknown in the lower portions of the valley of the Jordan, but slight
frosts are sometimes felt on the sea-coast and near Lebanon." Throughout
Western Asia cold frosty nights are frequently succeeded by warm days.
"Hoar frost" (Heb. kephor , so called from its covering the ground) is
mentioned in [Exo 16:14](../kjv/exo016.htm#014.md); [Job
38:29](../kjv/job038.htm#029); [Psa 147:16](../kjv/psa147.htm#016.md). In
[Psa 78:47](../kjv/psa078.htm#047.md) the word rendered "frost" (R.V.
marg., "great hail-stones"), hanamal, occurs only there. It is rendered
by Gesenius, the Hebrew lexicographer, "ant," and so also by others, but
the usual interpretation derived from the ancient versions may be
maintained.
