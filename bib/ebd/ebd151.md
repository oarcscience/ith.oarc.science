<span id="000">**Goad**</span> (Heb. malmad , only in [Jdg
3:31](../kjv/jdg003.htm#031).md), an instrument used by ploughmen for
guiding their oxen. Shamgar slew six hundred Philistines with an
ox-goad. "The goad is a formidable weapon. It is sometimes ten feet
long, and has a sharp point. We could now see that the feat of Shamgar
was not so very wonderful as some have been accustomed to think." In
[Sa1 13:21](../kjv/sa1013.htm#021.md), a different Hebrew word is used,
dorban, meaning something pointed. The expression ([Act
9:5](../kjv/act009.htm#005), omitted in the R.V..md), "It is hard for thee
to kick against the pricks", i.e., against the goad, was proverbial for
unavailing resistance to superior power.

<span id="001">**Goat**</span> (1.) Heb. 'ez , the she-goat ([Gen
15:9](../kjv/gen015.htm#009); [Gen 30:35](../kjv/gen030.htm#035.md); [Gen
31:38](../kjv/gen031.htm#038).md). This Hebrew word is also used for the
he-goat ([Exo 12:5](../kjv/exo012.htm#005.md); [Lev
4:23](../kjv/lev004.htm#023); [Num 28:15](../kjv/num028.htm#015).md), and
to denote a kid ([Gen 38:17](../kjv/gen038.htm#017.md), [Gen
38:20](../kjv/gen038.htm#020).md). Hence it may be regarded as the generic
name of the animal as domesticated. It literally means "strength," and
points to the superior strength of the goat as compared with the sheep.
(2.) Heb. 'attud , only in plural; rendered "rams" ([Gen
31:10](../kjv/gen031.htm#010), [Gen 31:12](../kjv/gen031.htm#012).md);
he-goats (Num. 7:17-88; [Isa 1:11](../kjv/isa001.htm#011).md); goats ([Deu
32:14](../kjv/deu032.htm#014); [Psa 50:13](../kjv/psa050.htm#013).md). They
were used in sacrifice ([Psa 66:15](../kjv/psa066.htm#015).md). This word
is used metaphorically for princes or chiefs in [Isa
14:9](../kjv/isa014.htm#009), and in [Zac 10:3](../kjv/zac010.htm#003.md)
as leaders. (Compare [Jer 50:8](../kjv/jer050.htm#008).) (3..md) Heb. gedi
, properly a kid. Its flesh was a delicacy among the Hebrews ([Gen
27:9](../kjv/gen027.htm#009), [Gen 27:14](../kjv/gen027.htm#014.md), [Gen
27:17](../kjv/gen027.htm#017); [Jdg 6:19](../kjv/jdg006.htm#019)). (4..md)
Heb. sa'ir , meaning the "shaggy," a hairy goat, a he-goat ([Ch2
29:23](../kjv/ch2029.htm#023).md); "a goat" ([Lev
4:24](../kjv/lev004.htm#024).md); "satyr" ([Isa
13:21](../kjv/isa013.htm#021).md); "devils" ([Lev
17:7](../kjv/lev017.htm#007).md). It is the goat of the sin-offering ([Lev
9:3](../kjv/lev009.htm#003), [Lev 9:15](../kjv/lev009.htm#015.md); [Lev
10:16](../kjv/lev010.htm#016)). (5..md) Heb. tsaphir , a he-goat of the
goats ([Ch2 29:21](../kjv/ch2029.htm#021).md). In [Dan
8:5](../kjv/dan008.htm#005), [Dan 8:8](../kjv/dan008.htm#008.md) it is used
as a symbol of the Macedonian empire. (6.) Heb. tayish , a "striker" or
"butter," rendered "he-goat" ([Gen 30:35](../kjv/gen030.htm#035.md); [Gen
32:14](../kjv/gen032.htm#014)). (7.) Heb. 'azazel (q.v..md), the
"scapegoat" ([Lev 16:8](../kjv/lev016.htm#008.md), [Lev
16:10](../kjv/lev016.htm#010), [Lev 16:26](../kjv/lev016.htm#026)). (8..md)
There are two Hebrew words used to denote the undomesticated goat: Yael,
only in plural mountain goats ([Sa1 24:2](../kjv/sa1024.htm#002.md); [Job
39:1](../kjv/job039.htm#001); [Psa 104:18](../kjv/psa104.htm#018).md). It
is derived from a word meaning "to climb." It is the ibex, which
abounded in the mountainous parts of Moab. And 'akko , only in [Deu
14:5](../kjv/deu014.htm#005.md), the wild goat. Goats are mentioned in the
New Testament in [Mat 25:32](../kjv/mat025.htm#032.md), [Mat
25:33](../kjv/mat025.htm#033); [Heb 9:12](../kjv/heb009.htm#012.md), [Heb
9:13](../kjv/heb009.htm#013), [Heb 9:19](../kjv/heb009.htm#019.md); [Heb
10:4](../kjv/heb010.htm#004.md). They represent oppressors and wicked men
([Eze 34:17](../kjv/eze034.htm#017); [Eze 39:18](../kjv/eze039.htm#018.md);
[Mat 25:33](../kjv/mat025.htm#033).md). Several varieties of the goat were
familiar to the Hebrews. They had an important place in their rural
economy on account of the milk they afforded and the excellency of the
flesh of the kid. They formed an important part of pastoral wealth ([Gen
31:10](../kjv/gen031.htm#010), [Gen 31:12](../kjv/gen031.htm#012.md); [Gen
32:14](../kjv/gen032.htm#014); [Sa1 25:2](../kjv/sa1025.htm#002).md).

<span id="002">**Goath**</span> A lowing, a place near Jerusalem,
mentioned only in [Jer 31:39](../kjv/jer031.htm#039.md).

<span id="003">**Gob**</span> A pit, a place mentioned in [Sa2
21:18](../kjv/sa2021.htm#018), [Sa2 21:19](../kjv/sa2021.htm#019.md);
called also Gezer, in [Ch1 20:4](../kjv/ch1020.htm#004.md).

<span id="004">**Goblet**</span> A laver or trough for washing garments.
In [Sol 7:2](../kjv/sol007.htm#002.md), a bowl or drinking vessel, a bowl
for mixing wine; in [Exo 24:6](../kjv/exo024.htm#006.md), a sacrificial
basin. (See CUP.)

<span id="005">**God**</span> (A.S. and Dutch God; Dan. Gud; Ger. Gott),
the name of the Divine Being. It is the rendering (1.) of the Hebrew 'El
, from a word meaning to be strong; (2.) of 'Eloah, plural 'Elohim . The
singular form, Eloah , is used only in poetry. The plural form is more
commonly used in all parts of the Bible, The Hebrew word Jehovah (q.v.),
the only other word generally employed to denote the Supreme Being, is
uniformly rendered in the Authorized Version by "Lord," printed in small
capitals. The existence of God is taken for granted in the Bible. There
is nowhere any argument to prove it. He who disbelieves this truth is
spoken of as one devoid of understanding ([Psa
14:1](../kjv/psa014.htm#001).md). The arguments generally adduced by
theologians in proof of the being of God are: (1.) The a priori
argument, which is the testimony afforded by reason. (2.) The a
posteriori argument, by which we proceed logically from the facts of
experience to causes. These arguments are, (a) The cosmological, by
which it is proved that there must be a First Cause of all things, for
every effect must have a cause. (b) The teleological, or the argument
from design. We see everywhere the operations of an intelligent Cause in
nature. (c) The moral argument, called also the anthropological
argument, based on the moral consciousness and the history of mankind,
which exhibits a moral order and purpose which can only be explained on
the supposition of the existence of God. Conscience and human history
testify that "verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth." The
attributes of God are set forth in order by Moses in [Exo
34:6](../kjv/exo034.htm#006), [Exo 34:7](../kjv/exo034.htm#007.md). (see
also [Deu 6:4](../kjv/deu006.htm#004.md); [Deu
10:17](../kjv/deu010.htm#017); [Num 16:22](../kjv/num016.htm#022.md); [Exo
15:11](../kjv/exo015.htm#011); [Exo 33:19](../kjv/exo033.htm#019.md); [Isa
44:6](../kjv/isa044.htm#006); [Hab 3:6](../kjv/hab003.htm#006.md); [Psa
102:26](../kjv/psa102.htm#026); [Job 34:12](../kjv/job034.htm#012)..md)
They are also systematically classified in [Rev
5:12](../kjv/rev005.htm#012) and [Rev 7:12](../kjv/rev007.htm#012.md).
God's attributes are spoken of by some as absolute, i.e., such as belong
to his essence as Jehovah, Jah, etc.; and relative, i.e., such as are
ascribed to him with relation to his creatures. Others distinguish them
into communicable, i.e., those which can be imparted in degree to his
creatures: goodness, holiness, wisdom, etc.; and incommunicable, which
cannot be so imparted: independence, immutability, immensity, and
eternity. They are by some also divided into natural attributes,
eternity, immensity, etc.; and moral, holiness, goodness, etc.

<span id="006">**Godhead**</span> [Act 17:29](../kjv/act017.htm#029.md);
[Rom 1:20](../kjv/rom001.htm#020); [Col 2:9](../kjv/col002.htm#009).md),
the essential being or the nature of God.

<span id="007">**Godliness**</span> The whole of practical piety ([Ti1
4:8](../kjv/ti1004.htm#008); [Pe2 1:6](../kjv/pe2001.htm#006).md). "It
supposes knowledge, veneration, affection, dependence, submission,
gratitude, and obedience." In [Ti1 3:16](../kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md) it
denotes the substance of revealed religion.

<span id="008">**Goel**</span> In Hebrew the participle of the verb
gaal, "to redeem." It is rendered in the Authorized Version "kinsman,"
[Num 5:8](../kjv/num005.htm#008); [Rut 3:12](../kjv/rut003.htm#012.md);
[Rut 4:1](../kjv/rut004.htm#001), [Rut 4:6](../kjv/rut004.htm#006.md), [Rut
4:8](../kjv/rut004.htm#008.md); "redeemer," [Job
19:25](../kjv/job019.htm#025.md); "avenger," [Num
35:12](../kjv/num035.htm#012); [Deu 19:6](../kjv/deu019.htm#006.md), etc.
The Jewish law gave the right of redeeming and repurchasing, as well as
of avenging blood, to the next relative, who was accordingly called by
this name. (See REDEEMER.)

<span id="009">**Gog**</span> (1.) A Reubenite ([Ch1
5:4](../kjv/ch1005.htm#004)), the father of Shimei. (2..md) The name of the
leader of the hostile party described in Ezek. 38, 39, as coming from
the "north country" and assailing the people of Israel to their own
destruction. This prophecy has been regarded as fulfilled in the
conflicts of the Maccabees with Antiochus, the invasion and overthrow of
the Chaldeans, and the temporary successes and destined overthrow of the
Turks. But "all these interpretations are unsatisfactory and inadequate.
The vision respecting Gog and Magog in the Apocalypse ([Rev
20:8](../kjv/rev020.htm#008).md) is in substance a re-announcement of this
prophecy of Ezekiel. But while Ezekiel contemplates the great conflict
in a more general light as what was certainly to be connected with the
times of the Messiah, and should come then to its last decisive issues,
John, on the other hand, writing from the commencement of the Messiah's
times, describes there the last struggles and victories of the cause of
Christ. In both cases alike the vision describes the final workings of
the world's evil and its results in connection with the kingdom of God,
only the starting-point is placed further in advance in the one case
than in the other." It has been supposed to be the name of a district in
the wild north-east steppes of Central Asia, north of the Hindu-Kush,
now a part of Turkestan, a region about 2,000 miles north-east of
Nineveh.
