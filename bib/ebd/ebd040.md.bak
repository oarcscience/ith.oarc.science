<span id="000">**Baal-peor**</span> Lord of the opening, a god of the
Moabites ([Num 25:3](../kjv/num025.htm#003.md); [Num
31:16](../kjv/num031.htm#016); [Jos 22:17](../kjv/jos022.htm#017).md),
worshipped by obscene rites. So called from Mount Peor, where this
worship was celebrated, the Baal of Peor. The Israelites fell into the
worship of this idol ([Num 25:3](../kjv/num025.htm#003.md), [Num
25:5](../kjv/num025.htm#005), [Num 25:18](../kjv/num025.htm#018.md); [Deu
4:3](../kjv/deu004.htm#003); [Psa 106:28](../kjv/psa106.htm#028.md); [Hos
9:10](../kjv/hos009.htm#010).md).

<span id="001">**Baal-perazim**</span> Baal having rents, bursts, or
destructions, the scene of a victory gained by David over the
Philistines ([Sa2 5:20](../kjv/sa2005.htm#020.md); [Ch1
14:11](../kjv/ch1014.htm#011).md). Called Mount Perazim ([Isa
28:21](../kjv/isa028.htm#021).md). It was near the valley of Rephaim, west
of Jerusalem. Identified with the modern Jebel Aly.

<span id="002">**Baal-shalisha**</span> Lord of Shalisha, a place from
which a man came with provisions for Elisha, apparently not far from
Gilgal ([Kg2 4:42](../kjv/kg2004.htm#042).md). It has been identified with
Sirisia, 13 miles north of Lydda.

<span id="003">**Baal-tamar**</span> Lord of palm trees, a place in the
tribe of Benjamin near Gibeah of Saul ([Jdg
20:33](../kjv/jdg020.htm#033).md). It was one of the sanctuaries or groves
of Baal. Probably the palm tree of Deborah ([Jdg
4:5](../kjv/jdg004.htm#005).md) is alluded to in the name.

<span id="004">**Baal-zebub**</span> Fly-lord, the god of the
Philistines at Ekron ([Kg2 1:2](../kjv/kg2001.htm#002.md), [Kg2
1:3](../kjv/kg2001.htm#003), [Kg2 1:16](../kjv/kg2001.htm#016.md). This
name was given to the god because he was supposed to be able to avert
the plague of flies which in that region was to be feared. He was
consulted by Ahaziah as to his recovery.

<span id="005">**Baal-zephon**</span> Baal of the north, an Egyptian
town on the shores of the Gulf of Suez ([Exo
14:2](../kjv/exo014.htm#002); [Num 33:7](../kjv/num033.htm#007).md), over
against which the children of Israel encamped before they crossed the
Red Sea. It is probably to be identified with the modern Jebel Deraj or
Kulalah, on the western shore of the Gulf of Suez. Baal-capuna of the
Egyptians was a place of worship.

<span id="006">**Baana**</span> Son of affliction. (1.) One of Solomon's
purveyors ([Kg1 4:12](../kjv/kg1004.htm#012)). (2..md) Son of Hushai,
another of Solomon's purveyors ([Kg1 4:16](../kjv/kg1004.htm#016)). (3..md)
Father of Zadok ([Neh 3:4](../kjv/neh003.htm#004).md).

<span id="007">**Baanah**</span> Son of affliction. (1.) One of the two
sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, a captain in Saul's army. He and his
brother Rechab assassinated Ishbosheth ([Sa2
4:2](../kjv/sa2004.htm#002).md), and were on this account slain by David,
and their mutilated bodies suspended over the pool at Hebron ([Sa2
4:5](../kjv/sa2004.htm#005), [Sa2 4:6](../kjv/sa2004.htm#006.md), [Sa2
4:12](../kjv/sa2004.htm#012)). (2..md) The father of Heled, who was one of
David's thirty heroes ([Sa2 23:29](../kjv/sa2023.htm#029.md); [Ch1
11:30](../kjv/ch1011.htm#030).md).

<span id="008">**Baasha**</span> Bravery, the third king of the separate
kingdom of Israel, and founder of its second dynasty (1 Kings 15, 16;
[Ch2 16:1](../kjv/ch2016.htm#001).md). He was the son of Ahijah of the
tribe of Issachar. The city of Tirzah he made the capital of his
kingdom, and there he was buried, after an eventful reign of twenty-four
years ([Kg1 15:33](../kjv/kg1015.htm#033).md). On account of his idolatries
his family was exterminated, according to the word of the prophet Jehu
([Kg1 16:3](../kjv/kg1016.htm#003), [Kg1 16:4](../kjv/kg1016.htm#004.md),
[Kg1 16:10](../kjv/kg1016.htm#010).md).

<span id="009">**Babe**</span> Used of children generally ([Mat
11:25](../kjv/mat011.htm#025); [Mat 21:16](../kjv/mat021.htm#016.md); [Luk
10:21](../kjv/luk010.htm#021); [Rom 2:20](../kjv/rom002.htm#020).md). It is
used also of those who are weak in Christian faith and knowledge ([Co1
3:1](../kjv/co1003.htm#001); [Heb 5:13](../kjv/heb005.htm#013.md); [Pe1
2:2](../kjv/pe1002.htm#002)). In [Isa 3:4](../kjv/isa003.htm#004.md) the
word "babes" refers to a succession of weak and wicked princes who
reigned over Judah from the death of Josiah downward to the destruction
of Jerusalem.
