<P><A NAME="000"><B>Sivan</B></A>     A Persian word (Assyr, sivanu, &quot;bricks&quot;), used after the Captivity as the name of the third month of the Jewish year, extending from the new moon in June to the new moon in July (<A HREF="../kjv/est008.htm#009">Est 8:9</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Skin, Coats Made of</B></A>     (<A HREF="../kjv/gen003.htm#021">Gen 3:21</A>). Skins of rams and badgers were used as a covering for the tabernacle (<A HREF="../kjv/exo025.htm#005">Exo 25:5</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/num004.htm#008">Num 4:8</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Skull, The Place of a</B></A>     See GOLGOTHA 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Slave</B></A>     <A HREF="../kjv/jer002.htm#014">Jer 2:14</A> (A.V.), but not there found in the original. In <A HREF="../kjv/rev018.htm#013">Rev 18:13</A> the word &quot;slaves&quot; is the rendering of a Greek word meaning &quot;bodies.&quot; The Hebrew and Greek words for slave are usually rendered simply &quot;servant,&quot; &quot;bondman,&quot; or &quot;bondservant.&quot; Slavery as it existed under the Mosaic law has no modern parallel. That law did not originate but only regulated the already existing custom of slavery (<A HREF="../kjv/exo021.htm#020">Exo 21:20</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/exo021.htm#021">Exo 21:21</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/exo021.htm#026">Exo 21:26</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/exo021.htm#027">Exo 21:27</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/lev025.htm#044">Lev 25:44</A>; Josh. 9:6-27). The gospel in its spirit and genius is hostile to slavery in every form, which under its influence is gradually disappearing from among men. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Slime</B></A>     (<A HREF="../kjv/gen011.htm#003">Gen 11:3</A>; LXX., &quot;asphalt;&quot; R.V. marg., &quot;bitumen&quot;). The vale of Siddim was full of slime pits (<A HREF="../kjv/gen014.htm#010">Gen 14:10</A>). Jochebed daubed the &quot;ark of bulrushes&quot; with slime (<A HREF="../kjv/exo002.htm#003">Exo 2:3</A>). (See PITCH.) 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Sling</B></A>     With a sling and a stone David smote the Philistine giant (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1017.htm#040">Sa1 17:40</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa1017.htm#049">Sa1 17:49</A>). There were 700 Benjamites who were so skilled in its use that with the left hand they &quot;could sling stones at a hair breadth, and not miss&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg020.htm#016">Jdg 20:16</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch1012.htm#002">Ch1 12:2</A>). It was used by the Israelites in war (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2003.htm#025">Kg2 3:25</A>). (See ARMS.) The words in <A HREF="../kjv/pro026.htm#008">Pro 26:8</A>, &quot;As he that bindeth a stone in a sling,&quot; etc. (Authorized Version), should rather, as in the Revised Version, be &quot;As a bag of gems in a heap of stones,&quot; etc. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Smith</B></A>     The Hebrews were not permitted by the Philistines in the days of Samuel to have a smith amongst them, lest they should make them swords and spears (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1013.htm#019">Sa1 13:19</A>). Thus the Philistines sought to make their conquest permanent (compare <A HREF="../kjv/kg2024.htm#016">Kg2 24:16</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Smyrna</B></A>     Myrrh, an ancient city of Ionia, on the western coast of Asia Minor, about 40 miles to the north of Ephesus. It is now the chief city of Anatolia, having a mixed population of about 200,000, of whom about one-third are professed Christians. The church founded here was one of the seven addressed by our Lord (<A HREF="../kjv/rev002.htm#008">Rev 2:8</A>). The celebrated Polycarp, a pupil of the apostle John, was in the second century a prominent leader in the church of Smyrna. Here he suffered martyrdom, A.D. 155. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Snail</B></A>      (1.) Heb.  homit , among the unclean creeping things (<A HREF="../kjv/lev011.htm#030">Lev 11:30</A>). This was probably the sand-lizard, of which there are many species in the wilderness of Judea and the Sinai peninsula. (2.) Heb.  shablul  (<A HREF="../kjv/psa058.htm#008">Psa 58:8</A>), the snail or slug proper. Tristram explains the allusions of this passage by a reference to the heat and drought by which the moisture of the snail is evaporated. &quot;We find,&quot; he says, &quot;in all parts of the Holy Land myriads of snail-shells in fissures still adhering by the calcareous exudation round their orifice to the surface of the rock, but the animal of which is utterly shriveled and wasted, 'melted away.'&quot; 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Snare</B></A>     The expression (<A HREF="../kjv/amo003.htm#005">Amo 3:5</A>), &quot;Shall one take up a snare from the earth?&quot; etc. (Authorized Version), ought to be, as in the Revised Version, &quot;Shall a snare spring up from the ground?&quot; etc. (See GIN.)
