<span id="000">**Jehovah-jireh**</span> Jehovah will see; i.e., will
provide, the name given by Abraham to the scene of his offering up the
ram which was caught in the thicket on Mount Moriah. The expression used
in [Gen 22:14](../kjv/gen022.htm#014.md), "in the mount of the Lord it
shall be seen," has been regarded as equivalent to the saying, "Man's
extremity is God's opportunity."

<span id="001">**Jehovah-nissi**</span> Jehovah my banner, the title
given by Moses to the altar which he erected on the hill on the top of
which he stood with uplifted hands while Israel prevailed over their
enemies the Amalekites ([Exo 17:15](../kjv/exo017.htm#015).md).

<span id="002">**Jehovah-shalom**</span> Jehovah send peace, the name
which Gideon gave to the altar he erected on the spot at Ophrah where
the angel appeared to him ([Jdg 6:24](../kjv/jdg006.htm#024).md).

<span id="003">**Jehovah-shammah**</span> Jehovah is there, the
symbolical title given by Ezekiel to Jerusalem, which was seen by him in
vision ([Eze 48:35](../kjv/eze048.htm#035).md). It was a type of the gospel
Church.

<span id="004">**Jehovah-tsidkenu**</span> Jehovah our righteousness,
rendered in the Authorized Version, "The Lord our righteousness, "a
title given to the Messiah ([Jer 23:6](../kjv/jer023.htm#006), marg..md),
and also to Jerusalem ([Jer 33:16](../kjv/jer033.htm#016), marg..md).

<span id="005">**Jehozabad**</span> Jehovah-given. (1.) The son of
Obed-edom ([Ch1 26:4](../kjv/ch1026.htm#004).md), one of the Levite
porters. (2.) The son of Shomer, one of the two conspirators who put
king Jehoash to death in Millo in Jerusalem ([Kg2
12:21](../kjv/kg2012.htm#021)). (3.) [Ch2 17:18](../kjv/ch2017.htm#018.md).

<span id="006">**Jehozadak**</span> Jehovah-justified, the son of the
high priest Seraiah at the time of the Babylonian exile ([Ch1
6:14](../kjv/ch1006.htm#014), [Ch1 6:15](../kjv/ch1006.htm#015).md). He was
carried into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar, and probably died in Babylon.
He was the father of Jeshua, or Joshua, who returned with Zerubbabel.

<span id="007">**Jehu**</span> Jehovah is he. (1.) The son of Obed, and
father of Azariah ([Ch1 2:38](../kjv/ch1002.htm#038)). (2..md) One of the
Benjamite slingers that joined David at Ziklag ([Ch1
12:3](../kjv/ch1012.htm#003)). (3..md) The son of Hanani, a prophet of
Judah ([Kg1 16:1](../kjv/kg1016.htm#001.md), [Kg1
16:7](../kjv/kg1016.htm#007); [Ch2 19:2](../kjv/ch2019.htm#002.md); [Ch2
20:34](../kjv/ch2020.htm#034).md), who pronounced the sentence of God
against Baasha, the king of Israel. (4.) King of Israel, the son of
Jehoshaphat ([Kg2 9:2](../kjv/kg2009.htm#002).md), and grandson of Nimshi.
The story of his exaltation to the throne is deeply interesting. During
the progress of a war against the Syrians, who were becoming more and
more troublesome to Israel, in a battle at Ramoth-gilead Jehoram, the
king of Israel, had been wounded; and leaving his army there, had
returned to Jezreel, whither his ally, Ahaziah, king of Judah, had also
gone on a visit of sympathy with him ([Kg2 8:28](../kjv/kg2008.htm#028.md),
[Kg2 8:29](../kjv/kg2008.htm#029).md). The commanders, being left in charge
of the conduct of the war, met in council; and while engaged in their
deliberations, a messenger from Elisha appeared in the camp, and taking
Jehu from the council, led him into a secret chamber, and there anointed
him king over Israel, and immediately retired and disappeared ([Kg2
9:5](../kjv/kg2009.htm#005), [Kg2 9:6](../kjv/kg2009.htm#006).md). On being
interrogated by his companions as to the object of this mysterious
visitor, he informed them of what had been done, when immediately, with
the utmost enthusiasm, they blew their trumpets and proclaimed him king
([Kg2 9:11](../kjv/kg2009.htm#011).md). He then with a chosen band set
forth with all speed to Jezreel, where, with his own hand, he slew
Jehoram, shooting him through the heart with an arrow ([Kg2
9:24](../kjv/kg2009.htm#024).md). The king of Judah, when trying to escape,
was fatally wounded by one of Jehu's soldiers at Beth-gan. On entering
the city, Jehu commanded the eunuchs of the royal palace to cast down
Jezebel into the street, where her mangled body was trodden under foot
by the horses. Jehu was now master of Jezreel, whence he communicated
with the persons in authority in Samaria the capital, commanding them to
appear before him on the morrow with the heads of all the royal princes
of Samaria. Accordingly on the morrow seventy heads were piled up in two
heaps at his gate. At "the shearing-house" ([Kg2
10:12](../kjv/kg2010.htm#012).md) other forty-two connected with the house
of Ahab were put to death ([Kg2 10:14](../kjv/kg2010.htm#014).md). As Jehu
rode on toward Samaria, he met Jehonadab (q.v.), whom he took into his
chariot, and they entered the capital together. By a cunning stratagem
he cut off all the worshippers of Baal found in Samaria ([Kg2
10:19](../kjv/kg2010.htm#019).md), and destroyed the temple of the idol
([Kg2 10:27](../kjv/kg2010.htm#027).md). Notwithstanding all this apparent
zeal for the worship of Jehovah, Jehu yet tolerated the worship of the
golden calves at Dan and Bethel. For this the divine displeasure rested
upon him, and his kingdom suffered disaster in war with the Syrians
([Kg2 10:29](../kjv/kg2010.htm#029).md). He died after a reign of
twenty-eight years (884-856 B.C.), and was buried in Samaria ([Kg2
10:34](../kjv/kg2010.htm#034).md). "He was one of those decisive, terrible,
and ambitious, yet prudent, calculating, and passionless men whom God
from time to time raises up to change the fate of empires and execute
his judgments on the earth." He was the first Jewish king who came in
contact with the Assyrian power in the time of Shalmaneser II.

<span id="008">**Jehucal**</span> Able, the son of Shelemiah. He is also
called Jucal ([Jer 38:1](../kjv/jer038.htm#001).md). He was one of the two
persons whom Zedekiah sent to request the prophet Jeremiah to pray for
the kingdom ([Jer 37:3](../kjv/jer037.htm#003).md) during the time of its
final siege by Nebuchadnezzar. He was accompanied by Zephaniah (q.v.).

<span id="009">**Jehudi**</span> A Jew, son of Nethaniah. He was sent by
the princes to invite Baruch to read Jeremiah's roll to them ([Jer
36:14](../kjv/jer036.htm#014), [Jer 36:21](../kjv/jer036.htm#021).md).
