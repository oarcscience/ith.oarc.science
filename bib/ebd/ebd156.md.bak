------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="000">**Guest-chamber**</span> The spare room on the upper
floor of an Eastern dwelling ([Mar 14:14](../kjv/mar014.htm#014.md); [Luk
22:11](../kjv/luk022.htm#011)). In [Luk 2:7](../kjv/luk002.htm#007.md) the
word is translated "inn" (q.v.).

<span id="001">**Gur**</span> A whelp, a place near Ibleam where Jehu's
servants overtook and mortally wounded king Ahaziah ([Kg2
9:27](../kjv/kg2009.htm#027).md); an ascent from the plain of Jezreel.

<span id="002">**Gur-baal**</span> Sojourn of Baal, a place in Arabia
([Ch2 26:7](../kjv/ch2026.htm#007).md) where there was probably a temple of
Baal.

<span id="003">**Gutter**</span> Heb. tsinnor , ([Sa2
5:8](../kjv/sa2005.htm#008).md). This Hebrew word occurs only elsewhere in
[Psa 42:7](../kjv/psa042.htm#007.md) in the plural, where it is rendered
"waterspouts." It denotes some passage through which water passed; a
water-course. In [Gen 30:38](../kjv/gen030.htm#038.md), [Gen
30:41](../kjv/gen030.htm#041.md) the Hebrew word rendered "gutters" is
rahat, and denotes vessels overflowing with water for cattle ([Exo
2:16](../kjv/exo002.htm#016).md); drinking-troughs.

<span id="004">**Habakkuk**</span> Embrace, the eighth of the twelve
minor prophets. Of his personal history we have no reliable information.
He was probably a member of the Levitical choir. He was contemporary
with Jeremiah and Zephaniah.

<span id="005">**Habakkuk, Prophecies of**</span> Were probably written
about 650-627 B.C., or, as some think, a few years later. This book
consists of three chapters, the contents of which are thus
comprehensively described: "When the prophet in spirit saw the
formidable power of the Chaldeans approaching and menacing his land, and
saw the great evils they would cause in Judea, he bore his complaints
and doubts before Jehovah, the just and the pure (Hab. 1:2-17). And on
this occasion the future punishment of the Chaldeans was revealed to him
(Hab. 2). In Hab. 3 a presentiment of the destruction of his country, in
the inspired heart of the prophet, contends with his hope that the enemy
would be chastised." The third chapter is a sublime song dedicated "to
the chief musician," and therefore intended apparently to be used in the
worship of God. It is "unequaled in majesty and splendour of language
and imagery." The passage in [Hab 2:4](../kjv/hab002.htm#004.md), "The just
shall live by his faith," is quoted by the apostle in [Rom
1:17](../kjv/rom001.htm#017.md). (Compare [Gal
3:12](../kjv/gal003.htm#012); [Heb 10:37](../kjv/heb010.htm#037.md), [Heb
10:38](../kjv/heb010.htm#038)..md)

<span id="006">**Habergeon**</span> An Old English word for breastplate.
In [Job 41:26](../kjv/job041.htm#026) (Heb. shiryah .md) it is properly a
"coat of mail;" the Revised Version has "pointed shaft." In [Exo
28:32](../kjv/exo028.htm#032), [Exo 39:23](../kjv/exo039.htm#023.md), it
denotes a military garment strongly and thickly woven and covered with
mail round the neck and breast. Such linen corselets have been found in
Egypt. The word used in these verses is tahra, which is of Egyptian
origin. The Revised Version, however, renders it by "coat of mail." (See
ARMOUR.)

<span id="007">**Habitation**</span> God is the habitation of his
people, who find rest and safety in him ([Psa
71:3](../kjv/psa071.htm#003); [Psa 91:9](../kjv/psa091.htm#009).md).
Justice and judgment are the inhabitation of God's throne ([Psa
89:14](../kjv/psa089.htm#014), Heb. mekhon , "foundation".md), because all
his acts are founded on justice and judgment. (See [Psa
132:5](../kjv/psa132.htm#005), [Psa 132:13](../kjv/psa132.htm#013.md); [Eph
2:22](../kjv/eph002.htm#022.md), of Canaan, Jerusalem, and the temple as
God's habitation.) God inhabits eternity ([Isa
57:15](../kjv/isa057.htm#015).md), i.e., dwells not only among men, but in
eternity, where time is unknown; and "the praises of Israel" ([Psa
22:3](../kjv/psa022.htm#003).md), i.e., he dwells among those praises and
is continually surrounded by them.

<span id="008">**Habor**</span> The united stream, or, according to
others, with beautiful banks, the name of a river in Assyria, and also
of the district through which it flowed ([Ch1
5:26](../kjv/ch1005.htm#026).md). There is a river called Khabur which
rises in the central highlands of Kurdistan, and flows south-west till
it falls into the Tigris, about 70 miles above Mosul. This was not,
however, the Habor of Scripture. There is another river of the same name
(the Chaboras) which, after a course of about 200 miles, flows into the
Euphrates at Karkesia, the ancient Circesium. This was, there can be
little doubt, the ancient Habor.

<span id="009">**Hachilah**</span> The darksome hill, one of the peaks
of the long ridge of el-Kolah, running out of the Ziph plateau, "on the
south of Jeshimon" (i.e., of the "waste"), the district to which one
looks down from the plateau of Ziph ([Sa1
23:19](../kjv/sa1023.htm#019).md). After his reconciliation with Saul at
Engedi ([Sa1 24:1](../kjv/sa1024.htm#001).md), David returned to Hachilah,
where he had fixed his quarters. The Ziphites treacherously informed
Saul of this, and he immediately ([Sa1 26:1](../kjv/sa1026.htm#001).md)
renewed his pursuit of David, and "pitched in the hill of Hachilah."
David and his nephew Abishai stole at night into the midst of Saul's
camp, when they were all asleep, and noiselessly removed the royal spear
and the cruse from the side of the king, and then, crossing the
intervening valley to the height on the other side, David cried to the
people, and thus awoke the sleepers. He then addressed Saul, who
recognized his voice, and expostulated with him. Saul professed to be
penitent; but David could not put confidence in him, and he now sought
refuge at Ziklag. David and Saul never afterwards met. ([Sa1
26:13](../kjv/sa1026.htm#013).md).
