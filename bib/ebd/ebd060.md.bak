<span id="000">**Bittern**</span> Is found three times in connection
with the desolations to come upon Babylon, Idumea, and Nineveh ([Isa
14:23](../kjv/isa014.htm#023); [Isa 34:11](../kjv/isa034.htm#011.md); [Zep
2:14](../kjv/zep002.htm#014).md). This bird belongs to the class of cranes.
Its scientific name is Botaurus stellaris. It is a solitary bird,
frequenting marshy ground. The Hebrew word (kippod) thus rendered in the
Authorized Version is rendered "porcupine" in the Revised Version. But
in the passages noted the kippod is associated with birds, with pools of
water, and with solitude and desolation. This favours the idea that not
the "porcupine" but the "bittern" is really intended by the word.

<span id="001">**Bitumen**</span> [Gen 11:3](../kjv/gen011.htm#003.md),
R.V., margin, rendered in the A.V. "slime"), a mineral pitch. With this
the ark was pitched ([Gen 6:14](../kjv/gen006.htm#014.md). See also [Exo
2:3](../kjv/exo002.htm#003).) (See SLIME..md)

<span id="002">**Black**</span> Properly the absence of all colour. In
[Pro 7:9](../kjv/pro007.htm#009.md) the Hebrew word means, as in the margin
of the Revised Version, "the pupil of the eye." It is translated "apple"
of the eye in [Deu 32:10](../kjv/deu032.htm#010.md); [Psa
17:8](../kjv/psa017.htm#008); [Pro 7:2](../kjv/pro007.htm#002.md). It is a
different word which is rendered "black" in [Lev
13:31](../kjv/lev013.htm#031), [Lev 13:37](../kjv/lev013.htm#037.md); [Sol
1:5](../kjv/sol001.htm#005); [Sol 5:11](../kjv/sol005.htm#011.md); and [Zac
6:2](../kjv/zac006.htm#002), [Zac 6:6](../kjv/zac006.htm#006.md). It is
uncertain what the "black marble" of [Est 1:6](../kjv/est001.htm#006.md)
was which formed a part of the mosaic pavement.

<span id="003">**Blade**</span> Applied to the glittering point of a
spear ([Job 39:23](../kjv/job039.htm#023).md) or sword ([Nah
3:3](../kjv/nah003.htm#003).md), the blade of a dagger ([Jdg
3:22](../kjv/jdg003.htm#022).md); the "shoulder blade" ([Job
31:22](../kjv/job031.htm#022).md); the "blade" of cereals ([Mat
13:26](../kjv/mat013.htm#026).md).

<span id="004">**Blains**</span> Occurs only in connection with the
sixth plague of Egypt ([Exo 9:9](../kjv/exo009.htm#009.md), [Exo
9:10](../kjv/exo009.htm#010)). In [Deu 28:27](../kjv/deu028.htm#027.md),
[Deu 28:35](../kjv/deu028.htm#035.md), it is called "the botch of Egypt."
It seems to have been the fearful disease of black leprosy, a kind of
elephantiasis, producing burning ulcers.

<span id="005">**Blasphemy**</span> In the sense of speaking evil of God
this word is found in [Psa 74:18](../kjv/psa074.htm#018.md); [Isa
52:5](../kjv/isa052.htm#005); [Rom 2:24](../kjv/rom002.htm#024.md); [Rev
13:1](../kjv/rev013.htm#001), [Rev 13:6](../kjv/rev013.htm#006.md); [Rev
16:9](../kjv/rev016.htm#009), [Rev 16:11](../kjv/rev016.htm#011.md), [Rev
16:21](../kjv/rev016.htm#021.md). It denotes also any kind of calumny, or
evil-speaking, or abuse ([Kg1 21:10](../kjv/kg1021.htm#010.md); [Act
13:45](../kjv/act013.htm#045); [Act 18:6](../kjv/act018.htm#006), etc..md).
Our Lord was accused of blasphemy when he claimed to be the Son of God
([Mat 26:65](../kjv/mat026.htm#065.md); compare [Mat
9:3](../kjv/mat009.htm#003); [Mar 2:7](../kjv/mar002.htm#007).md). They who
deny his Messiahship blaspheme Jesus ([Luk
22:65](../kjv/luk022.htm#065); [Joh 10:36](../kjv/joh010.htm#036).md).
Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost ([Mat 12:31](../kjv/mat012.htm#031.md),
[Mat 12:32](../kjv/mat012.htm#032); [Mar 3:28](../kjv/mar003.htm#028.md),
[Mar 3:29](../kjv/mar003.htm#029); [Luk 12:10](../kjv/luk012.htm#010).md)
is regarded by some as a continued and obstinate rejection of the
gospel, and hence is an unpardonable sin, simply because as long as a
sinner remains in unbelief he voluntarily excludes himself from pardon.
Others regard the expression as designating the sin of attributing to
the power of Satan those miracles which Christ performed, or generally
those works which are the result of the Spirit's agency.

<span id="006">**Blastus**</span> Chamberlain to king Herod Agrippa I.
([Act 12:20](../kjv/act012.htm#020).md). Such persons generally had great
influence with their masters.

<span id="007">**Blemish**</span> Imperfection or bodily deformity
excluding men from the priesthood, and rendering animals unfit to be
offered in sacrifice ([Lev 21:17](../kjv/lev021.htm#017.md); [Lev
22:19](../kjv/lev022.htm#019).md). The Christian church, as justified in
Christ, is "without blemish" ([Eph 5:27](../kjv/eph005.htm#027).md). Christ
offered himself a sacrifice "without blemish," acceptable to God ([Pe1
1:19](../kjv/pe1001.htm#019).md).

<span id="008">**Bless**</span> (1.) God blesses his people when he
bestows on them some gift temporal or spiritual ([Gen
1:22](../kjv/gen001.htm#022); [Gen 24:35](../kjv/gen024.htm#035.md); [Job
42:12](../kjv/job042.htm#012); [Psa 45:2](../kjv/psa045.htm#002.md); [Psa
104:24](../kjv/psa104.htm#024), [Psa 104:35](../kjv/psa104.htm#035).md).
(2.) We bless God when we thank him for his mercies ([Psa
103:1](../kjv/psa103.htm#001), [Psa 103:2](../kjv/psa103.htm#002.md); [Psa
145:1](../kjv/psa145.htm#001), [Psa 145:2](../kjv/psa145.htm#002)). (3..md)
A man blesses himself when he invokes God's blessing ([Isa
65:16](../kjv/isa065.htm#016).md), or rejoices in God's goodness to him
([Deu 29:19](../kjv/deu029.htm#019.md); [Psa
49:18](../kjv/psa049.htm#018)). (4..md) One blesses another when he
expresses good wishes or offers prayer to God for his welfare ([Gen
24:60](../kjv/gen024.htm#060); [Gen 31:55](../kjv/gen031.htm#055.md); [Sa1
2:20](../kjv/sa1002.htm#020).md). Sometimes blessings were uttered under
divine inspiration, as in the case of Noah, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses
([Gen 9:26](../kjv/gen009.htm#026), [Gen 9:27](../kjv/gen009.htm#027.md);
[Gen 27:28](../kjv/gen027.htm#028), [Gen 27:29](../kjv/gen027.htm#029.md),
[Gen 27:40](../kjv/gen027.htm#040); [Gen 48:15](../kjv/gen048.htm#015.md);
49:1-28; Deut. 33). The priests were divinely authorized to bless the
people ([Deu 10:8](../kjv/deu010.htm#008.md); [Num
6:22](../kjv/num006.htm#022).md). We have many examples of apostolic
benediction ([Co2 13:14](../kjv/co2013.htm#014.md); [Eph
6:23](../kjv/eph006.htm#023), [Eph 6:24](../kjv/eph006.htm#024.md); [Th2
3:16](../kjv/th2003.htm#016), [Th2 3:18](../kjv/th2003.htm#018.md); [Heb
13:20](../kjv/heb013.htm#020), [Heb 13:21](../kjv/heb013.htm#021.md); [Pe1
5:10](../kjv/pe1005.htm#010), [Pe1 5:11](../kjv/pe1005.htm#011)). (5..md)
Among the Jews in their thank-offerings the master of the feast took a
cup of wine in his hand, and after having blessed God for it and for
other mercies then enjoyed, handed it to his guests, who all partook of
it. [Psa 116:13](../kjv/psa116.htm#013.md) refers to this custom. It is
also alluded to in [Co1 10:16](../kjv/co1010.htm#016.md), where the apostle
speaks of the "cup of blessing."

<span id="009">**Blind**</span> Blind beggars are frequently mentioned
([Mat 9:27](../kjv/mat009.htm#027); [Mat 12:22](../kjv/mat012.htm#022.md);
[Mat 20:30](../kjv/mat020.htm#030); [Joh 5:3](../kjv/joh005.htm#003).md).
The blind are to be treated with compassion ([Lev
19:14](../kjv/lev019.htm#014); [Deu 27:18](../kjv/deu027.htm#018).md).
Blindness was sometimes a punishment for disobedience ([Sa1
11:2](../kjv/sa1011.htm#002); [Jer 39:7](../kjv/jer039.htm#007).md),
sometimes the effect of old age ([Gen 27:1](../kjv/gen027.htm#001.md); [Kg1
14:4](../kjv/kg1014.htm#004); [Sa1 4:15](../kjv/sa1004.htm#015).md).
Conquerors sometimes blinded their captives ([Kg2
25:7](../kjv/kg2025.htm#007); [Sa1 11:2](../kjv/sa1011.htm#002).md).
Blindness denotes ignorance as to spiritual things ([Isa
6:10](../kjv/isa006.htm#010); [Isa 42:18](../kjv/isa042.htm#018.md), [Isa
42:19](../kjv/isa042.htm#019); [Mat 15:14](../kjv/mat015.htm#014.md); [Eph
4:18](../kjv/eph004.htm#018).md). The opening of the eyes of the blind is
peculiar to the Messiah ([Isa 29:18](../kjv/isa029.htm#018).md). Elymas was
smitten with blindness at Paul's word ([Act
13:11](../kjv/act013.htm#011).md).
